Well were Earth Chrissake Plenty places lost here

CALL

So Ive heard

After moment gets well goes Ripley She hands

bottle

Ripley looks it

CALL

Its drink You drink it

RIPLEY smiling I remember She drinks

CALL

So think

RIPLEY

Think

CALL

What now

RIPLEY

I dont know

She looks distance

RIPLEY Im stranger

The stand staring unfamiliar

horizon newborn dwindles dancing flame

THE END
