sleepy Ludlow

RISING UP 

We follow van sweeps town Ludlow looks picture

perfect birds eye vantage point Charming quiet

CHASE VO

So wherere going

GEOFF

Anywhere here

We continue rising brilliant blue sky losing van

amidst rolling Maine countryside

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MICMAC FOREST  DAY

RUSHING woods tree tops Its ocean

swaying green beneath us A forest ancient mysterious

Earth

AND SUDDENLY 

The endless trees fall us We

flattop mesa Micmac burial ground swooping downward

The ground surges us We Renees OPEN GRAVE

The quality light different now We hear wail

LONESOME WIND perhaps WHISPER altogether

alien

And unsettling note we

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
