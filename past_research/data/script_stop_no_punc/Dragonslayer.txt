seconds later Vermithrax follows squirming clawing

way upward When reaches dead offspring surveys

scene expressionless eyes Bringing head low

sniffs nudges lifeless little ones

AMBUSH

tunnel wall lunges forward Striking sparks point

sword slides dragons plated cheek

stabs deep scales heavy neck There

unearthly shriek creature flicks head

upward Galen goes sprawling finds holding half

sword The rest buried beasts neck
