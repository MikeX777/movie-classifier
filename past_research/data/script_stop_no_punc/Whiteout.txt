SCROLL OVER BLACK

Antarctica Six million square miles ice The

coldest place earth

Fortysix countries competing claims maintain

outposts The Antarctic Treaty holds claims

check

There regular law enforcement A single US

Marshal assigned territory

END SCROLL

EXT ANTARCTICA  DAY

Snowcovered hills thrust barren white

wasteland No buildings animals nothing

CLOSER The hills defined Rows jagged

peaks crazed pattern crevasses A fine mist

windblown snow whips jumble glinting

ice

STILL CLOSER We track valleys skirt

crevasses climb peaks finally pause flat

stretch ice HOLD scene timeless savage

beauty then

THUD

A FACE hooded goggled ECW extreme cold weather

gear drops frame smashing icy surface

brutal impact shattered goggle shield pops



 EYES STARE BLANKLY camera  locked death

Its man

Camera slowly starts PULL BACK limbs

snapped unnatural angles head grotesquely twisted

 bright red arterial blood seeps corpse

spreads tiny cracks ice until

startling speed turns dark freezes

We PULL BACK look body bizarre

shape spiders web frozen blood And SLOWLY WE

PULL BACK furtheruntil dazzling
