CALEB
Actually, it's else's

NATHAN
You know I wrote down. That
line came with. About
I've created conscious
machine, I'm man. I'm God.
CALEB
... I don't think that's exactly
I said.
NATHAN doesn't hear.
NATHAN
I thought - fuck. That's
perfect. It's good
story, tell it. `I

Non-deterministic.
NATHAN says nothing.
CALEB presses on.
CALEB (CONT'D)
At I thought mapping

hybrid.
Silence.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... No?
NATHAN
Caleb. I understand want
explain Ava works. But - I'm
sorry. I don't think I'll able
