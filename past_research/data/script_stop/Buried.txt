FADE IN:
INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT
Darkness. Silence. After long beat, hear movement,
confined contained.
We hear sound man, PAUL CONROY, groaning,
making confused attempts words. We hear movement;

sound body banging wood.
He screams, it's clear sound mouth
covered something.
After attempting sit up, immediately bangs head

labored.
He attempts left right,
confined sides, well. He frantically
shifts about, discover, touch, encased
something.
Something wrong, doesn't need know
that.
Finally, him, lit flame Zippo holds
hands, bound
rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag tied tightly
head, stretched mouth. Dried blood stains
hair forehead.
We lying old fashioned, wooden coffin.
Nothing rotted-out planks wood nailed
together. Realizing same, Paul struck
overwhelming, instant panic.
With great difficulty, holding lit Zippo,
Paul removes muzzle mouth.
PAUL
What...? What this?
His words unintelligible flails about,
fear understood utterance.
He screams aloud, voice captured coffin
walls.

PAUL
Oh God! Help me!! Help me!!
He kicks slams hands sides
coffin, avail. His violent movements cause small
grains sand trickle space
sides coffin, small gap
exists coffin's broken wooden planks.
Sweat cascades neck, dripping
dampened brow. The heat inside extremely close confines
coffin stifling.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Somebody help me! Please!!
Paul continues futile efforts pry
coffin. The sides, top, --
thoroughly reinforced force surrounds
coffin. Sand. It clear buried.
He tries best calm himself, trouble
catching breath. It takes time,
eventually achieves semblance calm.
Getting good look time,
Paul 37 years old. Unshaven
physically unremarkable, embodies blue-collar American
everyman.
He coughs. The minimal oxygen coffin makes
hard breathe.
His eyes widen bit seeing exposed, rusty nail. He
tries desperately use nail cut old,
frayed ropes bind hands. Doing easy task.
The incredibly tight quarters makes action nearly
impossible.
After lengthy struggle, rope snaps. Paul quickly frees
hands. A small victory. Very small.
The heat unbearable. Paul takes button-down
shirt, leaving T-shirt. His body battles
walls ceiling coffin
makes.
He tosses button-down shirt feet. His
undershirt drenched sweat.
Still trying calm himself, having little success
so, Paul looks coffin. His feet,
body-length away, miles him.

He looks coffin, feet.
With great difficulty, shifts body feet

After failed attempts, legs exhausted,

Close head, corner floor, there's
broken plank. A small hole.
He closes cigarette lighter, extinguishing flame. In
total darkness, continues cry.
PAUL (CONT'D)

With sobbing slowly subsiding, coffin soon grows
eerily silent.
The sound Paul's labored breaths hear, softened
blanket absolute darkness.
After beat, silence interrupted subtle buzzing
sound. The muted sight strange, blueish light flickers
coffin, Paul's feet. He extremely startled.
The buzzing continues, minimal splashing
light. It's coming underneath discarded button-down
shirt, near feet.
He lights Zippo better look.
Pulling shirt away, realizes hearing
seeing vibrating ring display features
older model cell phone.
He frantically reaches it, coffin far
small reposition easily.
To dismay, phone stops ringing. But, efforts
reach continue. He uses feet search phone.
After trouble finding it, eventually locates it.

Paul tries clasp box feet,
unsuccessful attempts, realizes new
strategy necessary.
38.
He makes efforts reposition coffin,
head feet ultimately switch places. He
struggles, inch troubled inch, maneuver.
Sweat pours face. The extremely tight
quarters coffin repositioning nearly
impossible.
After expending great deal energy so, Paul
eventually completes turn body. He examines
small, rusted metal box. On cartoon picture
small Arab boy girl playing red rubber ball.
Skeptical first, Paul carefully examines box
shakes gently. Items heard rummaging inside.
He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines
inside.
Paul looks inside finds lit, green glow stick,
fluorescing brightly illuminating coffin.
He closes lid Zippo. Removes stick.
Looking small box again, finds
items: small, disused flashlight; second, unlit glow
stick; jackknife; lastly, folded piece paper.
He slowly unfolds piece paper. We ransom
message written unintelligible mix English
Arabic.
Paul shakes head lets sigh disgust. He
crumbles paper ball listlessly drops

breaths echoing palms.
Under low-light green glow stick, Paul picks
phone dials home.
Per usual, gets answering machine. His son, Shane,
heard outgoing message.
SHANE

Dan ends call. Paul lets deep breath, finding
difficult lay claim replacement.
He looks watch. It's 7:18pm. The ticking sound
second hand turning inordinately loud,
extreme silence coffin.
Just then, cell phone rings. Checking number

Jabir ends call. Paul closes phone help conserve
battery life.
He reopens phone scrolls menu
options. Everything written Arabic. He eventually
comes icon movie camera -- video
function. He turns on. Looks
viewfinder.
After beat, closes phone, clearly frustrated
growing panicked. His breaths grow heavy rapid,
utilizing great deal oxygen.
47.
PAUL
I'm getting here.
Paul begins freak out, restlessly squirming inside
coffin pressing sides top.
The glow stick fades completely, offering
little light. Paul shakes it, change
brightness. Moments later, dies. Paul tries
flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing.
He bangs times hand. The white light turns
on, quickly turns off. He twists top,
causes flashlight switch bulbs. A red beam emits
momentarily. Paul twists gives
flashlight good whacks.
It turns on. White light shines dimly face.
He takes breath.
In efforts calm himself, removes orange
pill bottle pocket. He pours hand. He
removes small, metal alcohol flask
pocket takes large swig, swallowing pills
process.
Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops
additional pills swallows
generous pull flask.
He sits waits. Nothing happening,
extremely limited time keeps passing.
After moment, Paul picks cell phone. He holds

consideration, dials.

followed on.
Trying think say, Paul soon opts saying

Paul places phone chest. Still rubbing
temples, eyes begin flutter bit. He tries
control breathing remain calm.
53.
He opens phone displays photo Woman. He
stares admiringly her, hoping dearly
harmed.
The effects anxiety pills finally taking effect,
eyes soon close drifts sleep.
FADE TO:
INT. COFFIN - LATER
Darkness again. We hear sound Paul slowly
awaking, followed sight Zippo sparks.
It doesn't catch. The second glow stick snapped,
illuminating coffin fluorescent green hue.
Paul starts move, suddenly freezes. His eyes widen.
His pupils dilate. Something clearly wrong,
what.
His eyes slowly shift downward, watching
body. Beads sweat form brow. His
measured breaths held long be.
Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers glow stick
looking at.
A shape moves stomach, underneath T-shirt.
Paul's eyes fixed be. He cautiously,
slowly, moves glow stick closer.
The shape disappears light glow stick
shines be. Still, Paul dare
sudden move.
Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting top, slowly
undulating cuff.
Paul leans glow stick further. And further.
Carefully. Moving millimeter time. He shifts
position head slightly, charily,
feet.
He leans closer glow stick. But --
-- wary movement comes immediate stop.
It's snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It
positioned corner coffin, inches
Paul's feet.
54.
His terror evident, Paul slowly pulls feet
upper body, away snake. The confined
space offers little room safety.
The snake turns muscled neck face Paul. Their eyes
meet time. The snake hisses, poised strike
moment. Paul raises foot. Steels himself.
Prepares preempt snake solid stomp.
A sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering foot,
Paul cautiously removes flask pocket. Slowly
unscrews top. Splashes small alcohol
floor, close snake.
The snake recoils slightly, menacingly twists
new posture, ready attack. Paul lowers Zippo
small puddle alcohol. After sparks --
-- lights. A flash-fire. The snake flails hisses
wildly small wall.
The flame soon goes out. Paul moves fast. Throws
alcohol, time lands snake itself. He
places lit Zippo puddle alcohol
near snake.
Another flash-fire, time burning snake. It hisses
loudly. Threateningly. It swings forth,
challenging small wall fire.
The soon extinguishes. The snake burrows hole
likely entered coffin, disappearing
haste.
Paul hurriedly stuffs hole discarded button-down
shirt. He pours small alcohol
shirt temporarily puts flask ground,
screw cap securely. He wedges lit Zippo
small space wooden planks.
With snake situation handled, Paul finally lets
sigh relief. Rubs eyes. Tries regain
faculties. Looks list phone numbers written
him.
Suddenly, cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly searches
it, it. He notices fallen
small hole near feet, reach.
He makes attempts grab phone feet,
unable so. It continues ring.
His efforts involve repositioning coffin
completely turns face opposite end.
55.
Struggling move, Paul painstakingly begins
turn himself. While turning, however, inadvertently kicks
Zippo coffin -- landing
floor, glow stick -- knocks
flask.
We flame Zippo slowly melts plastic
glow stick, causing dim slightly.
Worst still, completely unbeknownst Paul, stream
alcohol slowly makes way flask
flame lighter, threatening set coffin ablaze.
Inch inch, flammable spirit gets closer.
Still midst repositioning, Paul looks
sees alcohol nearing flame. In panic, attempts
reach grab Zippo. But, finds stuck
middle coffin. He can't budge way.
PAUL
No, no, no!!
Desperately straining muscle body, extends
arm backward Zippo, hoping away
spilled alcohol. He can't reach it,
tries might.
The phone stops ringing. He missed call.
He tries blowing flame, head far away
breath strong
cause flicker.
With alcohol mere inches away flame, Paul
reaches shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching
foot impossible. He struggles undo laces
remove foot.
With face beet red force strain, Paul
finally removes shoe. The mere inch leg room
creates allows slide leg him.
The trail alcohol come contact
flame --
-- Paul deftly maneuvers body time
awkwardly kick Zippo way close lid.
Paul breaths enormous sigh relief sits dim
light damaged glow stick. He notices hole
coffin. As precaution, stuffs cloth
previously gag him.
56.
Just grab phone, hears appears
faint sound Muslim prayer
announced citywide PA system. The sound barely
makes way hundreds pounds sand
envelop coffin.
A sign hope, point reference
location -- albeit vague one.
He listens prayer continues. The
light glow stick dims further.
Paul opens phone. Sees missed Jabir's call.
He starts Jabir back, stops. He instead
navigates display menus. He soon reaches
appears Tools Menu, it's difficult
tell written Arabic. He
frustrated fails looking for.
On verge mental surrender, sees
gives pause. A smile crosses face.
PAUL
(re: phone screen)
There are.
We see, display phone, Paul
listing languages. He scrolls past -- "FRANCAIS,
DETSCHE, ESPANOL" -- stopping "ENGLISH." Presses
button, instantly making text screen readable.
He quickly navigates Tools menu. Scrolls down.
Locates number cell phone using.
He scribbles number coffin. Then
second pass, making bolder others.
Paul dials wife's cell phone. After

Both good signs, knows it.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Oh shit.
He begins panic. Grabbing pocket knife left
inside metal box, slides blade space
sides coffin top.
Paul grabs glow stick. But, partially
melted floor, stick snaps two. Liquid oozes
small portion stick remains stuck
floor.
PAUL
Son a...
Paul grabs flashlight. Turns on. It works
second, goes out. Shaking produces
intermittent beams light.
He turns top, switching red bulb. It works. The
coffin fills reddish hue, it, too, goes out.
Growing incensed, Paul switches white bulb. It
works.
He returns attention coffin. His efforts use
knife fulcrum futile. Still, tries. Bending
blade past design, nearly breaks
handle.
The flashlight turns off. After good shaking, turns
on, emitting white light.
With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts kind
Paul take. He stop try
catch breath.
As endeavors wind back, cell phone rings.
Not time, instead video message. It
sent Jabir.
Paul's trepidation evident. He fears incoming
video show.
58.
After beat, presses Accept button video
downloads. Within seconds, video plays phone
display screen. We see, video, American Woman
previously appeared picture message sent
Paul. She bound wrists, gag

She sits knees. Standing men,

fast approaching her. She cowers, protectively holding
bound hands face screams.
WOMAN (CONT'D)

Another Iraqi man steps camera's line site,
handgun brandished.
Without moment's hesitation, fires rounds
directly Pamela's head, killing her.
The video message ends immediately thereafter. Paul
complete shock.
He screams aloud, slamming closed fist
coffin.
PAUL
No! No, no, no!!!
Still throes emotional torment, Paul vomits
himself. He doubles over, vomit again.
His body, taxed point complete physical
breakdown, gradually slows levels itself. With vomit-
smeared face pressed cheek-down
coffin, Paul stares nothingness.

After beat, eye catches glimmer light -- blade
knife, reflecting beam flashlight.
Paul reaches knife. Lying back,
suffering enormous mental strain, places cutting edge

The cell phone service begins cut out. Suddenly,
coffin begins vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules
crack wood bottom, followed
faint sound explosion.
Within seconds, explosions grow louder
proximate. The vibration intense
violently shakes Paul coffin.
The sound jet plane engines heard coming above,
flying massive explosions continue.
Sand seeps crack sides
coffin shakes. Paul best brace
himself, bombardment far powerful.
A large crack forms wooden cover coffin,
spanning entire length. Sand immediately pours
concave shaped crack, seeping Paul like
hourglass.
Fearing coffin collapse
immense pressure sand above, Paul positions

screams loudly, little strength left
caving.
The shaking soon stops, steady flow sand
continues.
64.
In efforts prevent sand filling coffin
faster, Paul removes button-down shirt hole

The flashlight falls floor. The red light beam turns
off. Darkness. The sound sand steadily pouring down.
PAUL

Oh no...no...
Paul clicks flashlight different setting. White
light shines, goes out. He shakes flashlight
stays on, shining normal white beam.
He assesses situation, noticing coffin
filled small layer sand; situation
going worse time.
PAUL
This can't happening.
We Dan Brenner longer phone,

Once feels secure enough, Paul slowly moves body

Sweat drenches face. His eyes affixed, utter
disbelief, sand spills coffin, filling

He grabs cell phone,
signal.
PAUL (CONT'D)
No. Come on. Please work.
He shakes cell phone moves coffin,
hoping help. His efforts futile.
The flashlight goes dead. He hits it, shakes it. It turns
on. The brightness diminished.
Still sand continues fall, drowning deeper
deeper pool granules.
Then, surprisingly, cell phone rings. Paul answers
