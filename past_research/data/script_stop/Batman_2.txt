EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK
It's finally happened. Hell's frozen over.
Christmas weeks off, arid SNOW falling Gotham.
Beneath pristine white blanket, city looks
uncharacteristically serene -- inviting. Peace
miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. Salvation
Army Santas ring bells streetcorners. And now,
night falls, ILLUMINATED SIGN winks Broad Avenue:
"JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
Christmas."
The streets bustling jolly shoppers. At souvenir
store, exasperated MOM squabbling seven-
year old. Like storefronts Gotham,
overflowing bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
chains, ceramic figurines. The kid wearing
Batman baseball cap little black cape, obviously
wants more.
Mom drags past store window,
SCRAP METAL, sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
BATWING -- $19.95 up." A PANHANDLER perched
entrance. Beneath array jacket grubby sweatshirt
familiar yellow-and-black logo. In Gotham
winter, Batmania everywhere...
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Two hours later, SNOWSTORM's grown full-fledged
blizzard. The drifts feet deep streets
cars. A massive SNOW PLOW size
Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...
...and revealing, passes, group CAROLERS,
bundled mufflers parkas. Unbothered weather,
walk street singing, spreading cheer goodwill
passersby.
They've gone lovely capella rendition "Silent
Night" oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted snow
chains, clanks slowly past wake plow. Its sides
decorated cartoon igloos advertising popular ice

-- VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks street -- followed
sound AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.
EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

CAROLERS spill corner what's going on,
spray GUNFIRE sends scattering panic. The POLAR
BAR truck pulls jewelry store, does...
The REAR DOORS open. A RAMP slides
truck. The ROBBERS scramble aboard, mere seconds later
SLIDE AGAIN -- riding atop SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.
SIRENS HOWL. A POLICE CAR appears, taking corner
trifle fast -- FISHTAILING icy street plowing
drift.
INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The COPS gun engine, wheels spinning

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
SNOWMOBILES glide sidewalks, sending hardy
souls streets DIVING FOR COVER. A couple
DERELICTS cowering hydrant, trying
avoid getting run over. Every time poke heads out,

The ROBBERS fan directions. These guys
obviously going away clean -- unless...
The DERELICT points night sky, BEACON

huge steep drift prevents entering --

snowmobiles vanish trees.
The COPS race like headless chickens, trying concoct
plan. A couple trying scale stone walls
park. Another car, barking radio
mike:
COP WITH MIKE

(pause)
So do? Chase 'em foot??
ALL EYES TURN blare horn. The COPS peer
long corridor cross street -- STRANGE BLACK

In distance, COPS appear -- racing scene foot,

It's woman.
BOAT THUG I momentarily mesmerized. In time takes

SNAPS him: REELS HIM IN; lethal stroke,
RAKES steel talons face throat. He slumps

The BOAT THUG rushes her; catches jaw

Most DOCK GOONS taken flight, unlucky

Counting stiff's boat -- receding

Retracting steel claws, MASKED WOMAN crouches amid
