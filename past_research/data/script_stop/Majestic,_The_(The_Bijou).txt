REVISED DRAFT
October 14, 1997
"... magic you.
All time. Everywhere.
In thing.
The trick... it."
IN BLACK...
... insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat
BOOGIE-WOOGIE. Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up.
THEN...
... blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling
g-e-n-t-l-y, picture-postcard:
"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"
Then another... another, dropping frame,
gentle rain.
In old postcards, Hollywood dream town movie
stars glide big cars press hands-and-
footprints wet cement.
Another postcard:
"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD VINE!"
In postcard myth, you'd toddle Hollywood
Vine, bump Bogie Bacall, join dinner
Brown Derby. Or Ciro's. Or Coconut Grove...
More postcards. Pictures movie theaters, ones
I know today. These palaces. Temples.
Grauman's Chinese Egyptian. The Carthay Circle. The
Paramount, Million Dollar. From time moviegoing
complete experience, trip local mall. The
ushers friendly helpful wore gold brocaded
jackets guided seat. The popcorn hot
fresh buttered real butter, 30-weight motor oil.
CUT TO:
THE PILE OF POSTCARDS
wild jumble. Then, LAST POSTCARD drops lazily
pile. It's view Hollywood night, carpet
lights yawning, protective smile Mt. Lee's
famous resident, fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN. We PUSH INTO
THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE...
... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer closer,
fly right -- crazily loop
we're looking at...
EXT. HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT
SUPER TITLE: 1951
A gigantic aerial shot. Postwar autos muggy
midsummer evening air sounds thousands HONKING
HORNS, mere precursor traffic come. Darkened
outlying neighborhoods evidence postwar home
construction boom, scores stucco bungalows
built areas surrounding beating heart town,
swath garishly bright concrete called
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Of course, it's like

To me, it's theater that's
playing "The African Queen."
And like man said, film marquee "THE
AFRICAN QUEEN." Still shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, forecourt theater. The
MEN doff hats mop brows. The WOMEN pull
blouses away chests, fanning
movie-star maps marvel signed cement blocks.
We MOVE AMONG THEM, pick A COUPLE, stay
