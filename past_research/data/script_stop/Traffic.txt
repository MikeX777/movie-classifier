My Robert. This wife,
Barbara. We're Caroline's parents.
We're hear listen.
CUT TO:
OMIT.
EXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT
The house dark silent. The van parked
street.
INT. VAN - NIGHT
Gordon listens headset, expression set.
CARLOS (V.O.)
(over listening
device)
We're running.
Completely untouchable. Completely.
CUT TO:
EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - TIJUANA - DAY
A bank lights CRANKS on. Then ANOTHER ANOTHER.
In wider shot illuminated baseball field
children's pickup game progress.
In crowd, Javi serenely watches game.
THE END
