INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY
And we're speeding SOVIET JEEP... Two men front,

MEN back. A middle-aged Man wearing tired
suit tinted sunglasses trying hold on. And
him, Men, blindfolded. The man
forties, hands pressed pockets well-travelled
black-leather jacket... A stocky man, edge
J.D. Salinger character, he's seen once.
But lost self-confidence, here,

EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY
The Jeep races narrow winding streets Lebanese
village. It's shadowed Jeep front, back,

stern visages Ayatollah Khomeini, Hezbollah
religious leader, Sheikh Fadlallah... And, suddenly
convoy skids stop... And blindfolded Lowell Norman

INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY
A round-faced Man mid-forties, large-framed
glasses, black hair grey-black beard, wearing
dullbend, turban, sits informally kitchen table...
It's Sheikh Fadlallah face stares

EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
We brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, wet
grass lights vibrant, emerald green... A caged
cart, big yellow headlight, like kind
strange insect, drives range, picking golf
balls. And Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving
another, another... His swing powerful,
angry, lone golfer, trying chill out. He pauses, spent.
Settling down, exhales. Then, looks way...
And slows... He sees far distance, spot-lit,
lone golfer, Stocky Man, incongruously suit
tie, watching him... And Man suit right then,
great power tremendous follow drives
golf ball... The ball slamming steel net. And
lights SUDDENLY out. The range closing night.
The "insect" comes stop. And it's quiet, dark. Jeffrey
gathers clubs. He crosses, golf shoes, metal
cleats, clicking pavement, PARKING LOT.
And there's sound clicking golf shoes
him. He turns. And stocky Man suit, carrying
golf bag walking distance him, staring him.
Jeffrey comes parking lot. It's empty. Just

INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT
He drops clubs rear seat settles
wheel. He turns. And sees Man suit

club, jumps car...
EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
Golf club hand driver window...
WIGAND
(motioning club,

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WIGAND'S CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY
Jeff's car field, giant Colgate-Palmolive clock
behind. The rain stopped. Steam rises weed strewn
lot. Lowell's seat. And
feeling they've talking hours...
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
Just example...
WIGAND
For example. James Burke, CEO
Johnson Johnson...when
lunatic poison
Tylenol bottles, didn't argue
FDA... He didn't wait FDA
tell him. He pulled Tylenol
shelf store right
America. Instantly. And
developed safety cap... Because,
look, CEO, sure, he's gotta
great businessman, right? But he's
man science. He's going
allow company...to
shelf...a product hurt people.
(sarcastic)
Not like Seven Dwarfs...

Mostly, I got paid lot. I took

He looks Lowell, needing validation...
LOWELL
Nothing's wrong that. That's it;
you're making money...you're providing
family? What wrong
that?
It's quiet. After moments...
WIGAND
I've thought myself...as man
science. That's what's wrong it.
LOWELL

Jeffrey doesn't anything.
LOWELL (CONT'D)
Because, look, here's lays out:

There's guy figure

Lowell's evenhanded...is evenhanded? As Wigand
contemplates edge he's standing on, they're quiet. Then
Wigand sees time...
WIGAND

MIKE WALLACE
No shit.
LOWELL
What's this?
MARK STERN
(re: video)
What tobacco's standard
defense. It's "we don't know"
litany: "Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know. We bunch
leaves, roll 'em together. You smoke

We don't know."
(beat)
So...tells nothing.

DON HEWITT
Interfering? That's do.
