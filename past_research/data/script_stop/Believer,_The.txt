RAV ZINGESSER
"And God said Abraham, 'Take
son, son, love,
Isaac, land Moriah
offer sacrifice
mountain I you..."
INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY
A run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit old-
fashioned desks. These Hasidim, Orthodox Jews:
normal American kids yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV
ZINGESSER young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored.
RAV ZINGESSER
And Holy One -- blessed
He -- this? Why ask
Abraham sacrifice son,
loved?
Two boys side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose)
DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue breath....
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Isaac wasn't son. Ishmael
son, too.
12-YEAR-OLD AVI
The son loved.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Oh, kill
love them...?
12-YEAR-OLD STUART
(up front; answering Zingesser)
It test Abraham's faith. Of
devotion God.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
It's Abraham's faith. It's
God's power. God says, "You
know powerful I am? I
I want, matter
stupid. Even kill son.
Because I'm everything, you're nothing."
TITTERS. Danny looks classmates: nerds,
wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids furtively read
racing form desks. He hates
indifference despises Stuart's piety Avi's
ass-kissing.
RAV ZINGESSER
But, Danny, HaShem everything,

judge His actions?
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
We free intelligence --
God allegedly gave us....
AVI
Anyway, God lets Abraham kill
Isaac. He provides ram --
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Personally, I think that's lie. I
think kill him.
RAV ZINGESSER
You think?! Based what?
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
There's midrash supporting this. My
father read book Shalom Spiegel
-- Isaac actually died
reborn.
RAV ZINGESSER
No follows midrash.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
I do; I follow it. But okay, God
provided ram. So what? Once
Abraham raised knife,
heart he'd killed him.
He forget that. And
Isaac. Look him:
he's traumatized, he's putz
rest life. By end can't
tell Jacob Esau....
The kids laugh. Zingesser CRACKS ruler desk.
RAV ZINGESSER
Watch language....
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
(rising impassioned)
I think Jewish people
permanently scarred happened
Mt. Moriah, live
terror....
12-YEAR-OLD STUART
Fear God beginning wisdom.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Fear God makes afraid
everything. All Jews good
afraid. And sacrificed.
Oooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even guys sports
pages shocked one.
12-YEAR-OLD STUART
Don't believe God?
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
I'm
believe. You he's mysterious,
merciful. I power-
drunk madman He is. And we're
supposed worship Deity?? I
Never! I say...fight him. I --
The ruler CRACKING "power-drunk" on.... Now
Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks chair.
RAV ZINGESSER
Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer come
remove Danny class....
Avi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly free.
RAV ZINGESSER
And you, come Egypt,
destroyed
desert worshipped
Golden Calf.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Then let Him destroy now. Let Him
crush like conceited bully He is.
(to ceiling)
Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The class sits frozen terror, waiting God kill
Danny. But happens.
INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
Danny runs steps alone.
EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT
Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher,
blonder) coming him. He slips yarmulke
slants street. The kids slant way. He hears
RUMBLING, looks ELEVATED TRAIN entering station.
He runs steps SHRIEKING train....
INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY
TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER
The train passes car lots, discount furniture
stores, residential streets...finally pulls
station. The doors open. People file on, CAMERA letting
spots tall, COLLEGE STUDENT
YARMULKE. Danny grown up?
PAN sits, opens organic chemistry text. The
doors close. The train starts up, Jewish boy hardly
notices; reading. He sways motion
car, half-hidden passengers. We realize

REVERSE ANGLE: YOUNG MAN, standing -- "SUEDE-HEAD"

pinned stiff, wavy hair, oversized shirt
collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,
dandruff, ingrown facial hair...
He steps closer, crowding boy's knees. The boy shifts

head pursues bench until, unable slide
farther, boy flattens legs seat. Suede-
head presses boy's knees.
The boy accidentally bumps BUSINESSMAN Suede-head's

American) looks boy Suede-head understands
going on.
Suede-head stares right -- BUSINESSMAN returns
paper. Suede-head eases aside steps
boy's shoe.
SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOOR
The wingtip wiggles forth, finally working free.
The boy hasn't looked up.
SUEDE-HEAD THE JEWISH BOY
swaying, locked strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head
forces boy contorted postures,
increasingly ridiculous denials happening. And
boy stops reading chemistry text,
keeps highlighting relevant passages.
The train slows. The boy closes book, caps
highlighter, gathers things manages stand up,
wriggling awkwardly Suede-head. The doors open,
gets off.
INT. STATION -- DAY
Looking long escalator, Jewish boy riding

Suede-head arrives run top, races

The boy realizes -- finally turns

He won't fight, simply acknowledging

Suede-head rest.
SUEDE-HEAD

He slaps face. He stumbles backward. As Suede-

CUT TO:
INT. DANNY'S STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Like brain, room crowded tidy has,
far see, windows doors. Shelves
books, CDs, magazines, videotapes loom neatly bed.
Danny, briefs boots, lifting weights. The phone
rings. A machine picks up: outgoing message, BEEP.
Then:
WOMAN'S VOICE

Danny Balint...Danny, it's Vicki,
met Happy Jack's month...?
He keeps curls.
WOMAN'S VOICE

She hangs up. A moment later Danny finishes set, gasping
air, heart pounding, muscles throbbing.

DANNY

A strange place. As waits, Danny turns
watches skinheads aware him.
The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One

The skins puzzled, indicates watch: time

They exchange looks: know Curtis?
CURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.)
...Where I grew South Boston
years ago, kid walked

INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
Grand threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like child,
Carleton like sardonic adolescent, Billings like
revolutionary, Danny like uncrowned prince.
CURTIS ZAMPF addressing dozen guests. He 40
appears younger; rough good looks, longish hair
leather jacket, like aging rock star
sexy novelist standard-issue American Nazi.
CURTIS
...If ran car,
old Mick'd yell him, "Jimmy
Dunne, sidewalk
stay there...."
He Boston Irish accent well, everybody laughs.
Up notice WOMAN room. She
40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. Her LINA MOEBIUS.
CURTIS
...The day graduated high school,
he'd uncle gas
works, priest's brother
shipyard, apprentice papers,
years later he'd making
$16.50 hour, kids, play
ball Sundays Columbus Park,
died, town'd
drunk him....
The crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers,
unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops --
listens quietly.
During this, young woman (CARLA) appears rear
apartment, heading kitchen coffee cup
history book. She glances living room.
CURTIS
...Today, kid walks
street it's trash
half faces black. The
shipyard's closed, jobs
gas works set-asides,

barely job Burger King.
So drinks, smokes crack,
hangs porch

wake couple buddies
mother. The boy's father won't
he's dead till months
later.
(beat)
The soul country
destroyed, government
offer free trade, mutual funds
IPOs.
GUY DANIELSEN
You sound like leftist.
CURTIS
I one.... No, seriously, I
called anarchist. I stood
oppressed. I opposed state
power.
AN OLD COOT
Don't still?
CURTIS
I oppose present state
it's weak. It
left emasculated Vietnam. But
I think average man crushed
accumulated capital
loss community real leadership,
personal emptiness simply
own....
(matter-of-fact)
That's I'm fascist. It's
form government
addresses deepest needs.
Silence. Danny -- spotted Carla -- begins clap,
join in. Danny raises hand; Curtis nods
him....
DANNY
What think fascism
twenty-first century look like?
Everyone -- including Carla -- turns asked that.
CURTIS
More cultural political.
DANNY
Obviously.
CURTIS
Decentralized, nonviolent,
increasingly mainstream. We'll
antiabortion, anti-immigration groups
form alliances gun lobby,
Christian identity types, tax resisters
libertarians....
The crowd impressed, restless bored.
OLD COOT
What race?
A stirring: share concern. Lina watches closely.
CURTIS
This isn't time that.
Murmurs surprise, disappointment.
DANNY
I disagree.
(glances Carla)
I think race central
we're talking about.
(murmurs agreement)
Spiritual life comes race. From
blood. Without that, we're
better Jews....
The magic word. The room comes alive. Zampf grimaces.
CARLA
What's wrong Jews?
MRS. MOEBIUS
Carla...
DANNY
Have read Toynbee? Spengler?
CARLA
Nobody reads stuff anymore.
DANNY
Too difficult?
CARLA
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul
Virilio?
DANNY
The point is, modern world
Jewish disease.
CARLA
Disease? What disease?
DANNY
Abstraction. They're obsessed
abstraction.
That stops conversation. But Carla intrigued;
mind moves strange interesting realms.
VOICE (GUY DANIELSEN)
What propose?
The questioner young man (GUY DANIELSEN), better spoken
others. Danny feels eyes him.
DANNY
Killing Jews.
A tremor fear excitement ripples room.
Zampf glances Mrs. Moebius; watching Danny intently.
CURTIS
That catastrophic mistake.
DANNY
People hate Jews. Do agree?
CURTIS
They to. Today it's issue.
DANNY
No, deep down, beneath
"tolerance" learn television,
nothing's changed. The word
makes skin crawl.
(around room people nod)
It isn't hate, really. It's
way feel rat runs
floor. We want step
it. Crush it. We don't know why.
It's physical reaction. Everyone
feels it.
GUY DANIELSEN
Which ones kill?
DANNY
Prominent Jews. Who
symbols
represent aspects Jewish
character people despise.
GUY DANIELSEN
Such as?
OLD COOT
Barbra Streisand.
Mutterings: "Who's she?" "Yeah, her..." But Danny says:
DANNY
Too obvious.
VOICES
Kissinger...Dershowitz...Roseanne...
DANNY
Yes. And Larry King...
OLD COOT
Is Jewish?
DANNY
...Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob
Dylan, Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader
Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona
Ryder, Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler,
Katherine Graham. All them. But
yet. We don't want celebrity
obscuring issue.
CARLA
Which what?
DANNY
At first, know
victims killed.
CURTIS
You wouldn't announce it?
DANNY
I'd nothing. After three,
people try pattern. A
reason.
CURTIS
But comes out, public
outraged. It look like
Germany again.
DANNY
Isn't want? Germany
again? Only right time...
The crowd feels deep atavistic thrill. Zampf glances
Mrs. Moebius....
DANNY
Without speeches political parties.
A movement leaders
stop it...
The room stunned silence. Mrs. Moebius signals Curtis.
CURTIS
Okay, let's break now....
(to Danny)
Could wait minute...?
INT. SAME -- FIVE MINUTES LATER
Danny -- flushed triumph -- stands looking
city.
ACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS. MOEBIUS CURTIS ZAMPF
CURTIS

MRS. MOEBIUS

CURTIS
Yes, course. But plays

MRS. MOEBIUS

DANNY
Without blood -- willingness
spill -- there's real power,
authority.
LINA

Curtis afraid you'll marginalize us.
DANNY
We're marginal. We saying

Isn't precisely appeal?
LINA
So Jew kill first?
DANNY

automatic silencer.
CARLA
Why silencer?
DANNY

A HIGH-ANGLE view coffee shop. After moment, Danny
enters frame, starts it....
INT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY
Danny enters, looks around. To surprise sees GUY
DANIELSEN Nazi meeting rising, extending hand.
GUY DANIELSEN
Danny...Guy Danielsen...
DANNY
(sardonic, gets it)
You...
Guy shrugs, smiles apologetically.
ANOTHER ANGLE -- DANNY GUY WITH COFFEE
GUY
Milk...?
As Danny declines, Guy gets small cassette recorder,
turn on, notices Danny's reaction....
GUY
Is okay I record this?
DANNY
No... Yeah, fine, ahead... So
what's about? Is me?
GUY
I'm trying figure
radical right going next....I
thought interesting
person meeting.
DANNY
What Curtis Zampf?
GUY
Curtis politician -- bit
hustler. He's thinker.
DANNY
I agree.
GUY
The night said modern
world Jewish disease. Could
elaborate that?
DANNY
In movement -- racialist
movement -- believe there's
hierarchy races. Not
IQ, civilization, art,
forms government,
civilizations race
produces... Why writing
you're recording it?
GUY
It helps concentrate.... So
mean you're white supremacist?
DANNY
What I be, white inferior-
ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian?
Let ask, people from?
GUY
My mother's family French,
father's German, originally.
DANNY
German. Mine, too. So
think's given world,
Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe,
Nietzsche -- entire continent
Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
GUY
Danny, Jews?
Danny shifts seat, growing interested....
DANNY
The Jews different.... Blacks
disgusting inferior, it's
like criticizing retarded child.
The Jews are...a poison human
well....
GUY
A poison...?
DANNY
Let example.... Sexuality.
GUY
Sexuality??? What mean?
DANNY
You fuck Jewish girl?
GUY
What??!?
DANNY
Did fuck one, Guy?
GUY
(laughing, embarrassed)
What's with...I've gone
a, Jewish women. Why?
DANNY
And? WHat notice?
GUY
Notice? Like what...?
DANNY
Jewish girls like head, right?
GUY
I don't know. Is right?
DANNY
And Jewish men like it.
GUY
Everybody likes to, don't they?
DANNY
Yes. It's pleasurable. But
Jews obsessed it. You know why?
GUY
Why?
DANNY
Because Jew essentially female.
GUY
Female...
DANNY
Real men -- white, Christian men --
fuck woman. We come
cocks. But Jew doesn't
like penetrate thrust --
can't assert directly --
resorts perversions. Oral
sex technically perversion,
know that, don't you?
(as Guy nods)
After woman Jewish
man, wants normal partner
again. A normal man.
GUY
Does mean Jew better
lover?
DANNY
You're listening. He isn't better.
He gives pleasure, that's
actually weakness.
GUY
Danny, makes think know
this?
DANNY
Let's I've diligence.
GUY
So, fine, it's Jew,
Jews media banks.
It's they're sexually corrupt.
DANNY
The Jews clearly control media
banks. Investment banks,
commercial ones. But point
carry realms
principles display
sexuality. They undermine traditional
life; deracinate society.
Danny leans sure Guy's getting right.
DANNY
Deracinate... Tear roots. A
people -- real people -- derives
genius land: sun,
sea, soil. This
know themselves. But Jew doesn't
soil.
GUY
He Israel.
DANNY
Those aren't Jews.
GUY
Of course they're Jews.
DANNY
Notice Israelis: fundamentally
secular society. They longer need
Judaism soil. The
real Jew wanderer, nomad. He
roots, attachments. So
"universalizes" everything. He can't
hammer nail, plow field. He
buy sell, invest capital,
manipulate markets. He takes life
people rooted soil turns
cosmopolitan culture based
books, ideas, numbers. This
strength....
(pumped;
loves)
Take great Jewish minds: Marx,
Freud, Einstein. What given
us: communism, infantile sexuality
atom bomb. In mere
centuries guys emerged
ghettos Europe, they've
taken world built order
reason hurled chaos
class warfare, irrational urges
relativity, world
existence matter meaning
doubt. Why? Because
deepest impulse Jewish soul
unravel fabric life
left thread,
nothingness. Nothingness
end...
GUY
Are Jews same?
DANNY
Differences exist, course,
they're irrelevant. For Jew,
Jewishness dominates everything. Even
ones renounce it, hate it,
want cut
hearts knife...can't escape.
They're Jews.
Guy finishes writing looks up.
GUY
Danny, great. You're
incredibly articulate. One
thing... How believe
you're Jew yourself?
A beat. Danny smiles mistake....
DANNY
What? Excuse me?...
(Guy says nothing)
You're kidding, right?
GUY
Do know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman?
He Congregation Beth
Elohim Ozone Park...?
DANNY
Who? How I know him?
GUY
He says bar mitzvahed there,
March 1988.
DANNY
You believe that? And
reporter?
GUY
So you're saying it's true.
DANNY
Look me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
He indicates hair, turns sideways profile?
GUY
Were bar mitzvahed
else?
DANNY
Do know you're fucking here?
GUY
That's I'm trying out,
Danny. Who I fucking here?
DANNY
(sputtering, unsure
say)
Listen me....
GUY
Why Nadelman lie?
DANNY
To discredit me. Because I know
are. Look, I thought I explained
you. Those people
anything. And will. It's
narrative them, it's... Are
going print guy said?
GUY
Give reason to.
DANNY
It's slander. It's reckless disregard.
I'll sue fucking Jew paper.
GUY
Does mean deny says
true? Yes no.
GUN: pulled Danny's pants, slammed table...
Guy sits abruptly. Danny picks up, cocks it....
DANNY
Look me. Look me, Guy.... Oh,
can't look me? Look me,
schmuck. Look me....
(pokes gun Guy's face)
You print shit New York
Times...I'll kill myself.
Everyone place staring. Danny walks out, stuffing
gun pants, shoving man aside door.

Ow, shit... You're stepping
fucking -- ...Get me...Goddammit...
(sounds PUNCHES, SCUFFLE)
Stop it!... Where's light?
One appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating
vaster darkness. A SERIES OF LIGHTS bang
ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: vaulted ceiling...
stained glass panels... We are:
INT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT
A dour, ornate place built early decades
century. The sight silences moment. Then...
CARLETON
Jew World...!!
Drake, Billings, Carleton, O.L. Steroid run wild...
kicking benches...spray-painting swastikas...hurling
prayer books...urinating balcony...
...Danny looks like revisiting childhood
home: slides hand pew back...leafs
chumash...gazes eternal lamp red
glass...the gilded doors ark... A hint Kol Nidre
MUSIC haunts him....
DANNY
(to himself, barely
whisper)
Shut up. Fuck you....
KYLE (O.S.)
What...?
Danny turns; Kyle right him.
DANNY
Nothing. Where it?
(as Kyle hoists
sports bag)
Okay, let's panels
bema...the
stage.
As unscrew panel, Carleton runs past. A football
flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER.
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT
DANNY WATCHES KYLE attach bomb (four sticks dynamite
wired digital timer) 2x4 bungee cord. He
hooks ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free.
The bomb falls.
Kyle gasps. Danny catches it.
Frozen, look other. Kyle exhales, takes
bomb and, Danny holding it, carefully restrings
bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead:
STEROID (O.S.)
Wow, look shit....
DANNY
What doing?
Kyle idea doesn't care. Danny scrambles out.
INT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT
Straightening up, Danny stunned vision:
THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS
...their silver crowns breastplates, velvet robes. And
Steroid Excess, lifting out. Danny reacts
instinctive horror.
DANNY
What doing? Put down!
...Put there.
Steroid -- cowed Danny -- starts obey,
can...
BILLINGS
What care?
DANNY
I don't, but...
BILLINGS
(vaults stage)
Let's look fucking thing.
Each CURSE makes Danny wince, hovers
nervously Billings Steroid try unwrap Torah
gather, comically wrapping
tallises.
DANNY
Put there, the...
He indicates bema, stepping deny
involvement, time trying monitor
do.
DANNY
(indicating crowns,
yod...)
Just careful the...
O.L.
(puts crown head)
"If I king forest...not
Prince, Duke, Earl..."
Danny endure desecration,
laughs, keeps mouth shut.
KYLE
Open up.
DANNY
(impulsively taking over)
Here...
He shoves way and, gripping handles, unrolls
Torah. Low MURMURS sight broad columns,
mysterious calligraphy, CRACKLING parchment. Danny
struck sudden immediacy sacred text.
OVER this...
VOICES
Oooo... Weird... You read
right left.... The letters look
like squashed bugs.... What kind
paper that?
DANNY
It's paper, it's parchment. It's
sheepskin. And
letters drawn hand.
KYLE
Neat calligraphy.
Danny nods, then, will....
DANNY
It's called flame alphabet. It's
supposed word God
written fire.
BILLINGS
Fire...
DANNY
The mystics tried read white
spaces letters. They
thought alternative
language hidden there, secret,
alternative meanings.
KYLE
Cool.
Danny sees Drake watching him, smirks express disgust.
BILLINGS
How come know shit?
DANNY
How come don't know it?
(pressing advantage)
How hate Jews
don't know --
BILLINGS
Fuck you. I hate Jews
do.
DANNY
No, don't.... If hated them,
you'd study them, you'd know
hate them. You know tefillin
is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know
kaddish kiddush?
(obviously not)
Eichmann? He went Israel. He
studied Torah, Talmud,
Mishnah, bit. He hated Jews.
CARLETON
Who's Eichmann?
DANNY
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Danny's incredulous, it's clear
know Eichmann was.
KYLE
He head Gestapo's Jewish
sector. He deported people camps.
CARLETON
(reaching parchment)
Can touch it?
DANNY
Yeah, letters.
BILLINGS
Why fuck not?
DANNY
(warning finger)
Just don't.
Billings bristles Danny's authority; Carleton says him...
CARLETON
Didn't Raiders Lost Ark?
BILLINGS
What??
CARLETON
That ark, man. That
Torah. They fucked it,
Torah melted faces.
BILLINGS
That's movie, moron.
CARLETON
Fine, ahead. Touch letters.
The gathered around, delicately touching
sheepskin.
BILLINGS
Let see.
He pushes through, looks Torah. He runs fingers
crinkled parchment, smooth black letters.
DANNY
I said --
Suddenly Billings grabs parchment hands
tries tear it. It's tougher looks.
DANNY
Stop it! What doing?
He tries stop him, -- accidentally -- Drake
gets way, Danny else,
Billings crumples finally tears long gash
scroll.
This produces strange effect others. Some (Kyle,
Steroid, Drake) join in. They knock aitz bema,
rolls out, exposing feet Torah. They stamp it,
spit it.... Others (Carleton, O.L.), troubled
Danny, surprised (and embarrassed)
revulsion acts.
Danny watches helplessly, like survivor
son murdered.
Finally Torah lies torn soiled stage. A
strange silence.
KYLE
Let's here.
...Danny kneels Torah. With tallis, attempts
clean parchment. Carleton O.L. help roll
aitz. [Echo "Christ taken cross" Torah
Christ.] They replace cover, yod, crowns....
Finally Danny lifts up, holds
dead child. He closes eyes, murmurs himself....
DANNY
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai
echod.
CARLETON
What'd say?
DANNY
Nothing. Let's go....
He starts walk out, carrying Torah.
CARLETON
Why taking that?
DANNY
I'm stealing it.

INT. SMALL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT
Packed well-dressed crowd, different

MRS. MOEBIUS
Half right-wing money New York

If impress them, I
know can, movement
running tomorrow. And

She straightens tie, directs lectern. He
hesitates....
DANNY
We tested new bomb.
MRS. MOEBIUS

DANNY
Then know do?...
You love them.
Puzzled mutterings: "What?... What's talking about?..."
DANNY

It sounds strange, I know,
people simple. The

little business fornicate
over-sexed wife.... But isn't
true. He wants hated. He longs
scorn. He clings
core mystery
being. If Hitler existed,
Jews invented him. For
hatred, so-called
Chosen People vanish
earth....
People react confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.
DANNY
...And reveals terrible truth,
crux problem Nazis:
worse Jews treated,
stronger become. Egyptian
slavery nation;
pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave
birth State Israel.
Suffering, seems,
crucible genius. If Jews
are, said,
people yes
answer, let yes them.
If thrive opposition, let
cease oppose them. The way
annihilate them, utterly
completely, open arms,
homes embrace them.
Only vanish
assimilation, dilution...and love.
(a warning finger)
But pretend. The Jew
clever. He
condescension hypocrisy.
To destroy him, love
sincerely.
ON THE AUDIENCE, befuddled. A HAND goes up. Danny nods it.

hate, wouldn't "destruction"
