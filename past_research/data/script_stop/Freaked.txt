DISSOLVE TO:
INT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe bar it,
words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen
reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president E.E.S., smiling rigidly

Rick holds up, pushes away disgust.
RICK

(to aide)
Rico, misguided clowns

RICK

Hertz lets big laugh. He shakes head Rick.
HERTZ
Rick, Rick, Rick... You want
proof? Fine. Just seat.
Please.
Rick nods entourage. They sit boardroom table,
EES execs. An easel Hertz shows
placard bar graph. Hertz whispers
aide, scurries off.
HERTZ
(TO RICK)
Meet head South American
research facility, Juan Valdez.
The aide ushers handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE
natty three-piece suit sombrero.
GEORGE

HERTZ

Santa "Flan?" What kind shitty
country that?
GEORGE

4.
Rick nods. We cut George, isn't George
anymore. He mutated similar looking actor,
suit, sombrero, shorter swarthier.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I personally supervised
development...
Rick furrows brow. He's little suspicious George's
transformation, little.
Now George shorter, swarthier. Yet
actor.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I performed rigorous scientific
tests. No potential danger
left uninvestigated...
Rick's suspicion increasing. He looks Hertz,
feigns total innocence.
George shorter. Still actor. His
clothes baggy, sombrero starting slide
face.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
The environmentalists

Rick looks entourage. Their mouths hang open
astonishment.
George shrunk near-midget proportions. The
sombrero completely covers head. When takes off,
he's played LINDA HUNT!
GEORGE
It's ridiculous, I tell you.
Totally ridiculous!
Rick ready ask questions, Hertz cuts off.
HERTZ

making face.
RICK
Wait second--

HERTZ

The aide reveals new placard easel. It reads "$2
MILLION."
RICK
Look, sounds great, but--
HERTZ

(a new placard: 5 MILLION)
is, board agrees ...
Hertz reaches chair pulls lever. The old
geezers raise arms stiffly,
pulled strands fishing line, are.
HERTZ
Good, it's unanimous. Well,
