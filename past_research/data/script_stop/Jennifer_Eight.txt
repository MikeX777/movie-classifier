2: EXT. OAKLAND BRIDGE. SAN FRANCISCO BAY. DUSK.
High Golden Gate. Too high specifics. But
Camera. Descending
Music isolate particular car. Too
distant know is. But Camera follow-
ing mile 101 Interstate travelling north.
Maybe dissolve. And maybe not. But red white
way headlights coming on. The Camera closing
highway. And car definitely selected. There
it. It's blue Mercedes sedan.
Mussorgsky choreograph pace cuts. The
puts frame directly car. In moments
brights snap up. And Titles continue dazzle light.
3: INT. MERCEDES SEDAN. 101. DUSK.
Nobody car BERLIN. And lot cigarette smoke.
Just time wedge P.O.V. There's intersection coming
up. He hits indicators crosses lanes winding wind-
ow down. Takes hit cigarette exits butt.
4: EXT. FREEWAY INTERSECTION. DUSK.
An instant red cigarette shatters highway. A
heavy sky red black cloud. The Mercedes turns head-
ing east. This time Camera doesn't follow. Remains static
intersection tail lights finally disappear.
5: INT. LIVING ROOM. HOUSE. DAWN.
Bare wooden boards sound singing birds. This house
hasn't lived years. No furniture new
mattress middle floor. Still polythene wraps.
BERLIN awake it. Ten seconds disorien-
tation puts together. A stone fireplace. Stairs
leading what's got tiny room above. With ef-
fort place charming. But right it's wreck.
6: INT. KITCHEN. HOUSE. DAWN.
This kitchen date 1963. A huge china sink
fat fridge. But cooker works battered old kettle
gas. T-shirt instant coffee. BERLIN checks
cupboards out. Crockery includes cup that'll now.
His lips articulate silent expletive. The gas gone
out. Tries relight success. On hands knees
explores rubber supply pipe snakes door.
7: EXT. OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD. HOUSE. DAWN.
In garage finds gas cylinder. Empty
bastard it. He drags fingers hair frustration.
Looks heaps crap need clearing out. The
view hardly cares look at. But
follows. Clouds massing horizon. Fields getting re-
ady rain. His nearest neighbor 200 yards away.
His nearest Cow 50. This house remote rural look-
ing veranda back. But BERLIN inclination
sight-seeing. As walks away dreary female Voice seeps in.
8: INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN. HOUSE. DAWN.
The Voice comes police scanner. Most dialogue's
bullshit. Illegally parked autos drunks about.
BERLIN sits mattress eating breakfast chewing gum
milk. He unwraps Juicy Fruit regrets it. Goes
round mouth like shoe washing machine. A reluctant
decision taken. Spits gum sink arrives
kitchen. Starts unloading leather bag. A flotsam stuff
excavated including 9mm Beretta pack cigarettes.
He lights takes cruel hit nicotine guilt.
Wouldn't need clairvoyant realize he's trying up.
Something scanner interests wanders
living room. There's going "David 72 Sam 3."
David 72 acknowledges BERLIN clearly recognizes voice.
"We 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump." But David 72
hired. "I'm outside Emersons/ I wanna
horrible face day." BERLIN exhales smile. The
Controller needs E.T.A. 927? David 72 doesn't know.
Advises roll couple cars "Secure location."
9: EXT. HILLSIDE. SPRINGFIELD STREET. EUREKA. DAY.
A Chevrolet zig-zags shabby canyon. It's road

He quits car BERLIN watches scurry service
shop. Rain beats roof BERLIN looks stubbed out. A lot
cuts coming them. Runs hand
hair unconscious frustration. A finger constantly bothers
Zippo. Eyes ROSS silhouettes florescent light.
Somewhere background lights change red. Once
beeping sound traffic-lights speaking blind. Maybe
looks doesn't matter. Something happens
inside head isn't aware of. Everything close
up. Big Zippo. Big BERLIN. And leaps car.
BERLIN sprints weather. A station wagon
air end hydraulic jack. Surprise ROSS

28: EXT. LANDSCAPE/ROAD. TRINITY FOREST. DAY.
Mussorgsky shock cut. Big music shattering
landscape. Juniper woods mountains. Sunlight fresh fal-
len snow. Somewhere long way car crawls valley.
Ross's car bursts frame quickly bend snatches
away. An unexpected building distance. Victorian
glance probably later. A clock tower lifeless
windows. The Chevy disappears somber architecture.
29: EXT. THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE. DAY.
Pine trees slush parked cars. The Chevrolet swings
parks mansion. Breath air eyes
ugly pile slam doors head entrance.
30: INT. ENTRANCE/RECEPTION. INSTITUTE. DAY.

higher education - severe vis-
ual disability doesn't mean stud-
ents don't value independence

32: INT. CORRIDOR. INSTITUTE. DAY.
Looking deserted corridor. Someone tried sun-
shine walls yellow paint. Somewhere long way away
sound like children singing. ROSS loathes joint.
Loathes silence. Eyes BERLIN rings doorbell.
ROSS
Where everyone?
BERLIN
I dunno .. I guess
staff building?
Here come footsteps door opened HELENA ROBERTSON.
Early 20's blonde immediately beautiful. But delic-
ate features need big dark eyes. They look
away introductions she's shy. ROSS BERLIN grab
glances follow in. Neither expected HELENA blind.
33: INT. APARTMENT. INSTITUTE. DAY.
Claustrophobia evaporates instantly. Great views val-
ley window. Plus bizarre jumble furniture
colors. But pictures walls. No friendly photographs.
Nor lights. Although afternoon shutting
isn't light room. ROSS elects stay windows.
BERLIN takes offered chair. HELENA sits nervously opposite.
HELENA
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
BERLIN
I'm Mr Berlin. Mr Ross right
here. And Mr Ross maybe gonna

A touch later sun setting. ROSS stands window
watch go. Watches cars driving away. Watches
bird sitting outside fire-escape. BERLIN's voice
heard screen "You said spoke? Can re-
member said?" ROSS saunters HELENA's answer.
HELENA
Well, said, come on,
hurry up, you,

Empty teacups notebook. ROSS sits opposite BERLIN.
And I remember, lit-
tle breathless carrying

BERLIN
The elevator wasn't working?
HELENA

A clock strikes somewhere. And BERLIN knows he's lost it.
BERLIN

HELENA

He takes hands HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable.
He examines scars stares useless eyes.

BERLIN

HELENA
No. Except smoked. Like you.
BERLIN

HELENA

Meanwhile elevator arrives triggering Voice. "YOU ARE NOW
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR." Doors slide open Christ look this?
What kind eye-defect needs glasses like this? Lenses like ei-
ther half glass ball. He's early 30's decidedly "iffy."
Is student/staff what? As exits enter staring aft-
er him. As doors close MYOPIC turns stare them.
