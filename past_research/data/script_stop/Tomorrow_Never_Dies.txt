--------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN ON:
EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN
Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN
We're looking called "The End Known
World." A landscape beautiful, forbidding.
In center vista, deep ravine.
Pushing ravine, appears giant icicle hanging
cliff:
AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall face frozen solid.
Pushing closer, tiny black dot inching way
ice. A human figure. This is:
JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.
Bond sweating straining, feet air. He
ice-pick tethered hand, ice-cleats boots. A black
backpack. As climbs, spider-like, pulling up, goes
JAM A CLEAT ice, -
CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto ice breaks off, CRASHING rocks
below. Regaining foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
looks up: So very, very, far go. Bond shakes head:
BOND
There easier way earn
living.
Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, goes up, up, -
ANOTHER ANGLE -
He's 25 feet top. He drives ice pick in. Gets
toehold. But slams second pick -
THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -
BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -
And 007 dangling, 575 feet air, staring torrent
water - hanging leather thread wrist, attached
ice-pick, embedded wall.
Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins swing
forth, widening arcs, like clock's pendulum.
At high point swing, Bond reaches smash
pick ice - BUT MISSES. He looks at:
THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Beginning work way out. The tether, fraying.
RETURN ON BOND -
Cautiously, 007 begins swing second time. Once. Twice. And
arc, swings ice-pick viciously - MISSES AGAIN.
ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether totally
frayed through.
RETURN ON BOND -
One chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
ICE... Just tether finally snaps one. Still,
he's home: He reaches over, grabs pick (barely
holding ice,) jabs in, continues upward.
EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -
Exhausted, Bond reaches up, edge. He drives pick -
ice, hard, flat, ground beneath waterbed.
As pulls up, (his weight ice-pick,)
smashes second pick ice, waterbed, -
THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
Breaking groan, tumbling rocks below.
IN THE WATERBED -
A torrent water crashes 007. Fighting oncoming deluge,
crawls - belly - water - 25 feet inland.
NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)
Bond stands, walks riverbed. He looks cliff:
BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -
On water, small RADAR DISHES, angled
down, scanning inch area, save waterfall itself.
In words: This way in.
RETURN ON BOND -
007 shrugs. From backpack, takes TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
CANISTERS, ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses button
box, - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.
He presses buttons canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
slaps skis, takes off, snow.
EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -
EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -
Bond hurtles side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, skis out, down.
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -
Bond slaloms down, trees, avoid detection. At
bottom, snow thins, comes to:
A ROCK OUTCROPPING.
Hiding rock, Bond takes skis, knapsack. He
unpacks (and unfolds) HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts
HEADSET. He creeps rock, looks on:
A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)
50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN unloading CARGO dozen
MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s
ground (one partially obscured truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
HELICOPTERS SCUD MISSILES.
Near QUONSET HUT, TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans area,
INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted side.
BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
Props rife boulder, peers GUN SIGHT.
THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -
He sees closer (but wide) telescopic view men bargaining
weapons, forklifts loading/unloading crates munitions.

instantly, dives again.
