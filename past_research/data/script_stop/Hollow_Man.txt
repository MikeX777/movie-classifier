FADE IN:
On complete darkness.
A SMALL DOOR swings open.
A circle light reveals I looking
length tube. At far end tube,
gloved hand dangling rat. The hand shoves
frightened rat tube closes door
it. The rat s stark white fur bristles begins
pad tube s length.
After feet, tube opens dimly lit
cubicle. The rat hesitates stops.
The SOUNDS gentle BREATHING whispers rat s
ears.
The rat turns round head tube,
door swings shut, trapping cubicle.
The rat cowers BREATHING turns SNORTING.
The rat s head jerks around, looking signs danger,
cubicle empty. The rat sees water dish
far cubicle - place hide -
dashes it.
But invisible force descends.
The rat squeals agony smashes
body, crushing it.
A LOUD BELLOW rings out, rat flies air,
halting feet ground. Its body writhes,
struggling unholy force.
Then sick crunch tiny bones snapping. All life
quickly drains levitating body. Dead eyes...
The creature s corpse floats mid-air. Then white
fur rat explodes shower blood.
HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, red-slicked
ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites
rat.

complex rendered molecule displayed
screen. He pecks keys molecule shifts
slightly, falls apart.
Sebastian pulls twinkie hostess box, unwraps
cellophane sucks down. He attacks keyboard
renewed vigor.
Another molecule appears screen. Sebastian s
fingers fly keyboard. The molecule blinks
off, trembles twists apart.
SEBASTIAN
Damnit.
Sebastian pears window. Across courtyard,
light comes neighboring window. He sees
BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter

Working. Sebastian sighs, leans forward begins
pecking away again.
LATER:
The television static. We pan alarm
clock. 4 am. We Sebastian pacing

He gets idea... slides chair. Types away
again. The molecule reforms screen.
He types keys, waits, watches molecule.
Nothing happens.
He hits keys watches intently
reaction.
SEBASTIAN
(beat)
I goddamn genius.
He hits keys telephone keypad appears
screen. He dials.
CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Digital phone rings.
In bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs

SEBASTIAN
Watch this.
LINDA
You sure?
SEBASTIAN
91% sure.
LINDA
(astonished)
Eleven months progress
suddenly come
blue? How?
SEBASTIAN

LINDA
Yeah, I think I him. What
going do?
SEBASTIAN
Well y know. It s daylight

The elevator doors open Sebastian steps out. He s met
SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, fiery red-head.
SARAH
Can I word?
SEBASTIAN
Most normal people good morning.
SARAH
Don t think test
protocol liver samples
inject Isabelle?
SEBASTIAN
How tissue samples
successfully regressed? Hundreds,
right? How gone work
system? None.
SARAH
That s point.
SEBASTIAN
No, point. I m going
waste months life
outmoded testing procedure. This thing
works. I know it. I feel it.
Linda comes corridor, listening tail
end conversation.
SARAH
Fine. You mop afterward.
SEBASTIAN
You think I m going kill Isabelle?
SARAH
Kill? More like liquefy.
SEBASTIAN

MATT
Maybe stopped naming
yourself, d better luck.
SEBASTIAN
Why thank you, Dr. Kensington,
keen scientific observation. I ll
sure include memoirs.
MATT
A mention? And I thought I
gonna footnote.
Matt unwraps hypodermic needle jabs needle
vial, drawing colored liquid.
INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
MATT
Okay.
Frank Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
INT. LABORATORY - DAY
Tension air.
SEBASTIAN
(to Linda)
Ready.
She wraps bungee cord pulls
tight. She takes dye sprays it. A surface
appears, floating beneath restraints. It sheens
light Linda searches vein. She slaps
surface times. A small bulge appears, like
vein.
LINDA
Propped.
MATT
Let s history.
Matt lowers hypo vein. But Sebastian takes
hypo Matt s hand.
SEBASTIAN
Nice try, Sparky.
Matt relinquishes needle.
LINDA
Come on, Isabelle. You this.
Sebastian lowers hypo. The skin bonds gives. The
needle remains sight slips
visible surface. Matt presses hypo plunger,
releasing dye bloodstream. The gold liquid
twists long snaking tube limb.
It s shape vein. The liquid begins react.
Small flashes light blip strand
color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... heartbeat starts speed
up.
SARAH
Elevated heartbeat.
INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
Janice analyzes screens.
JANICE
We green.
FRANK
Confirmed. Vitals normal

MATT
It s reacting.
Spreading bloodstream, soon

SEBASTIAN
Do this?
LINDA
It s working. It s actually working.
Matt pulls sheet back. Muscles beginning
appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
SARAH
Heart rate s up. She s scared.
Sarah soothes her.

SARAH
Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating.
Brain activity going roof.
The brain appears, seemingly growing inside out.
The shape large half-formed monkey grows

SARAH (cont d)
We ve got problem.
SEBASTIAN
What? What problem!
Sarah checks monitors.
SARAH
It s heart. We heart

I got erratic heart beat.
SARAH
She s going cardiac arrest.
LINDA
Got crash cart.
Carter charges crash cart rolls in.
SARAH
We losing her.
Her machine flatlines.
SEBASTIAN
No! It s got work.
The body half there. It looks caught
decomposition. Linda rubs cardiac paddles together.
LINDA
Clear!
Linda slams paddles monkey s chest. The jolt

At table men. A handful senior military
brass civilian advisors direct attention

Linda, middle presentation.
SEBASTIAN
To successful phase-shift human
quantum sync

Next Sebastian video shows small monkey shifting
visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs
skeletons slowly dissolve eyes.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Well, sending
"never-never-land" easy, it's
getting that's hard.
Sebastian fast forwards moments video
screen shows bizarrely tangled heap flesh bone
alive.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
Every time we've tried bring test
subject phase-shift.
Cellular bonds dissolve,
primary DNA strands decay. But
now...
Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
But now...
One senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER,
distinguished 50s, finally breaks silence.
KRAMER
But now?
Linda Matt look Sebastian expectantly.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
But now...
(pause)
But now, feel closer

experimenting new
regression formula looks
promising.
A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.
GENERAL
How long?
SEBASTIAN
Sir?
GENERAL
Son, imagine,

SEBASTIAN
Keep voice down.
MATT
The protocol works. Why'd tell
didn't?
SEBASTIAN
I wasn't ready know.
MATT
But they're oversight committee.
They're supposed know.

You reason, didn't you,
Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN
I reason. I
goddamn epiphany.
They reach Porsche.
SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
What think they'd
know send subject
phase shift pull
again? How seconds

project, bringing soldiers
test formula on. We'd lost
control end week.
LINDA
It's money, Sebastian. It's
going happen eventually.
SEBASTIAN
I know. But yet. There's
learn. I don't want hands
tied political agenda

MATT
Well, then... mind telling
you're gonna human test-subject

SEBASTIAN
That's easy. I've decided test
procedure ...
INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
SEBASTIAN
... myself.
The team sits conference table. Their jaws

FRANK
Are nuts?
SEBASTIAN
Was Jonas Salk nuts?
FRANK
Yeah. Pretty sure was.
CARTER
And remember, Jonas Salk,
bunch guys aren't
famous cuz died.
SEBASTIAN
If we're unsure,
morally justify testing
else?
JANICE
Isn't little soon moving
phase anyway?
SARAH
She's right. We haven't finished
collating phase research.
SEBASTIAN
We'll plenty time collate
cross-reference later. Monkey data
doesn't matter anyway. The real
data human data.
SARAH
You don't know
protocols work humans.
SEBASTIAN
How gonna out? Besides,
we've succeeded gorilla
DNA 98% humans.
And 2% significant.
LINDA
Sebastian ... humans talk, build
houses cook microwave ovens.
Gorilla's live trees. That's
helluva 2% ask me.
SEBASTIAN
We're concerned. I know that. But
we're gonna forward ever,
do.
LINDA
Why you? Why us?
SEBASTIAN
The risks. I couldn't ask...
MATT
(interrupting)
What volunteer?
LINDA
What you're valuable lose?
SEBASTIAN
I'm Project Leader. It's formula
call. The best way express
concern damn sure
best work. I'll want
weeks to...
FRANK
To affairs order?
SEBASTIAN
To run reversions tissue
tests we'll attempt phase
shift. I'll stay shifted
days testing we'll perform
quantum regression.
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
A knock door.
SEBASTIAN
Come in.
Linda pushes room closes door

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
What?
LINDA
In past years, I've

LINDA
O.K. How're feeling?
Sebastian takes deep breath.
SEBASTIAN
Fine.
Sarah checks vitals.
SARAH
