Arcade

Last revised November 6, 1990
INT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS
We don't know it's night day. It's black.
And maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by. So quick barely
perceive them. Like sparks imagine eyes closed.
BREATHING,
slow hollow, filling entire world. It's eerie hell. A
feeling utter loneliness.
And breathing recedes, fading darkness. Whatever
was...it's gone now.
MAIN CREDITS ROLL.
We hear CELLOS. Four them. Weaving intricate melody.
And visuals. BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in. Equally
intricate, matching music. They grow flourish, like flowers
opening time lapse photography.
FRACTALS...
they're called. The visual manifestation geometric formulas.
The Mandelbrot Set. The Julia Set. Each mathematic form
progressively smaller forms infinity.
Glorious beautiful. Forms folding
regenerating.
This creation we're witnessing.
This life making.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
AN EYE
For brief moment hear CELLOS. And eye,
fractals spinning away, leaving iris. A nice blue
one. This ALEX MANNING'S eye.
ALEX (V.O.)
Time. That's I think
anymore. It's like there's
it, know?
CUT TO:
INT. MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY
This flashback, case you're wondering. We'll continue hear
Alex's VOICE house slow motion. Everything
bright dreamlike.
Right we're moving camera, slowly moving long hallway.
At end hallway open door.
We stop doorway. We're afraid in.
ALEX (V.O.)
It's strange. When future's
you, forever. I mean,
there. It's
step ahead you. It's like there's
present. There's "now". As soon
think, "I'm here", moment's
gone. Either everything's future,
it's past.
(beat)
There's "now".
MAN (V.O.)
So then?
ALEX (V.O.)
I'm past.
We doorway.
INT. MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY
Everything looks normal first. A typical bedroom sunlight
streaming windows. A bed, made-up. Flowers vases.
Everything looks perfect.
Then in, right. There's
floor, curled entranceway bathroom. Halfway in, halfway
out.
It's woman's body. She's wearing dress, legs awkwardly bent. We
can't face angle. But limp hand gun. And
hand, speckling pristine white tile bathroom
carpeting beyond, BLOOD.
A shrill BELL shatters moment.
CUT TO:
INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
The bell continues. It's school bell signaling end period.
ON ALEX
time, startled. She's seventeen pretty,
simple way. Her eyes striking. Deep. Intense.
If Alex problem, it's fact thinks much, it's
reflected eyes.
Across MR. WEAVER, high-school guidance counselor
voice heard Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged,
incapable hearing Alex say. This office
we're in. Typical "SAY NO TO DRUGS" teen propaganda decorate room.
Fun.
As BELL dies hear army FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling
halls.
Alex glances door starts rise chair.
MR. WEAVER
We don't stop now...
ALEX
(cutting off)
That's okay. I've got test coming
anyway. Gotta study.
MR. WEAVER
(sighs)
I tell you, I'm little concerned
you, Alex. It's months
mother, uh...
ALEX
(offering, fixing
stare)
Killed herself?
Mr. Weaver stops, little uncomfortable.
MR. WEAVER
(reluctant)
Yes. Now father...
ALEX
He's basket case. You've talked him.
You know that. He dead
too.
Alex glances floor, avoid looking
counselor. She heaves backpack shoulder.
ALEX
(continuing)
Look Mr. Weaver, I don't know I
came here. I fine. Really.
(looking up)
It's like I said. It's
past now. It doesn't matter anymore.
She turns, Mr. Weaver respond, she's door.
INT. HIGH-SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Alex moves quickly mass STUDENTS, wiping remnants
half-tears coat sleeve.
CUT TO:
INT. HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY
Fun-time. Total chaos. If you've high-school know riff.
Bad food, teen-age melodrama, squadron SUPERVISORS trying
lid things.
ALEX

garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, kids aren't

GREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend. Hopeful artist (not bad, either)
kind punk looking. Greg big fans thrift-shop
clothing. Because don't money, improvise.
NICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend future pioneer. He's
attractive he's got edge. A bit hot-shot. Genius

BENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable. Benz flunking school
like better spend rest life reading comic
books. He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, nervous. Stilts,
contrary nickname, short skateboard.
Stilts constantly hitting on...
LAURIE -- The sixth member group. A teen Theda Bara cynical
get. She's what's affectionately known "art chick".
The boys group, particularly Nick Stilts, avid
skateboarders frequently seen boards. Stilts
leafing issue THRASHER magazine.
Right group midst argument. Nick pocket
video game hands casually plays. He
games sleep. It BEEPS WHIRS.
NICK

BENZ

ARCADE
It looks place midst The Inferno. Shiny black,
high-tech, self-contained, like sort space-age vertical

Difford turns Nick salutes him.
DIFFORD
A man heart. Straight
point.
(to everyone)
What's different ARCADE way

changes strategy.
NICK
That's impossible.
DIFFORD
(taking bait)

Difford reaches coat pocket pulls quarter. He tosses
at...
NICK
snags mid-air grins.
GREG
Go it, Nick.
Difford steps aside waves Nick machine. The rest kids
crowd around.
ARCADE
isn't typical video game. First
screens...front, left, right...which provide panoramic view
playing. Second, player wears "data gloves" (which provide actual
sensation touch) stereoscopic goggles turn wired
directly machine. The results user feeling
he/she actually entered video game universe.
Difford thinks hit hands, excitement shows.
DIFFORD

"ESCAPE".
NICK
(skeptical)
"Escape"?
DIFFORD
In case things intense. It
automatically freezes game, gives
breather. Things pretty wild...
BENZ

Nick won't need it.
DIFFORD
You're good, eh?
NICK
(grins)
The best.
Nick winks Alex Greg.
NICK
(to Difford)
So what's scenario? Am I saving
princess? Fighting Zombies?
DIFFORD
It changes. There levels. Each
different layer ARCADE
universe. The concept is, you're entering
video game itself, making way
circuit board logic core
... ARCADE's brain.
NICK
So I start?
DIFFORD
The game guide you.
Nick turns machine pops quarter coin slot.
He punches "START" button joy-sticks.
Immediately screens come life. Darkness shooting stars
light racing forth.

They're fractals. Visual representations
mathematic equations. The game
totally brilliant. I mean, look it,

And truth, fractals beautiful.
Alex turns Nick. And time, Nick stops grinning.
It's clear Alex upset.
ALEX

CUT TO:
EXT. LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT
ON ALEX AND THE BOY
blink existence level. Alex rises, shaking badly.
Her armor battered, burnt, covered grim blood...it's
impossible tell who's blood, though. She looks like she's walked
slaughter-house.
A bone-jarring HUMMING heard. Alex turns...
ARCADE'S BRAIN
looms her, glass black steel. It reaches sky
keeps going. Massive. Tendrils crackling ENERGY race
it, BUZZING. And impossible seem, thing definitely
appears alive.
TWO GLASS DOORS
swing open invitation. A red carpet rolls
building, rolling itself. Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls
completely, ending Alex's feet.
Above doors, neon sign blinks on, word time,
"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE". Fucking-A.
Alex offers tired, near-maddened laugh. It's anymore.
THE BOY

Alex nods. She takes hand together, walk red carpet
entrance ARCADE'S brain.
INT. LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT
Inside, lobby cacophony LIGHT SOUND. We hear HUNDREDS OF
VOICES once...whispering...fading out... It's like channels
changed. A snippet opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice
there...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, woman throes orgasm, Nazis
screaming "HEIL HITLER!", everything.
SIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF...
Catchy phrases like, "THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT", "I THINK,
THEREFORE, I'M FUCKED" flash us.
T.V. MONITORS
everywhere, displaying endless array STATIC. And
monitors displaying FRACTALS. Every single them. We hear
CELLOS, like orchestra tuning up.
ALEX
throws hands ears SOUNDS unbearable.
ALEX
(top lungs)
SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She pulls gun FIRES SOUNDS IMAGES. Shooting
fuck everything. Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and...
...just like that, total silence descends. One one, lights blink
off, it's dark again.
INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM --
A SPOTLIGHT
comes on, isolating Alex. The boy stands her,
dark. It's impossible tell large room is. It
forever.
MORE LIGHTS
come now, pin-point spots illuminating faces friends.
They're there...Stilts, Laurie, others. Even Nick. They sit
rows, motionless...a peanut gallery. It's eerie hell.
And now, Alex sees else, Greg. He's encased block ice.
A frozen prince. And hands holds sword. The sword
unusual. The hilt shaped like heart glows RED
pulled furnace. Alex realizes sword ARCADE'S
heart.
Alex moves Greg. As gets closer, sees keyhole carved
ice.
Alex knows do. She withdraws belt golden
keys attached. Removing keys, Alex begins fit
together...one, two, three...until combine form shape
single, greater key.
THE KEY
Alex fits keyhole turns it.
THE CASE OF ICE
splits half, opening cloud frosty air. Inside, Greg
frozen still, clutching sword. Alex pulls sword stiff
grip, lifting up.
ALEX
(looking around)
Okay. I'm here, ARCADE. Where you?
No answer. Alex turns, eyes searching darkness.
ALEX
(shouting)
Where you, damnit?!
Her voice echoes cavernous room.
ARCADE (O.S.)
RIGHT HERE, BITCH.
Alex spins and...
THE BOY
stands her. He grins eyes pulse internal light.
We hear BREATHING now, like before. Just like game.
ALEX
(stunned)
You...you're ARCADE? But donor...
ARCADE/BOY
...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY. YOU SEE,
MOMMY USED TO BEAT ME. MOMMY THREW ME DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE...
(shivers)
...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD...
ARCADE begins change, shaking ROARING black
insect-like bursts boy's skin. It claws face, ripping
flesh away revealing altogether awful underneath.
Nothing prepared Alex this. It/ARCADE rises
takes ounce courage screaming. Somehow, Alex
finds reserve strength.
Alex swings sword and...
ARCADE SMASHES aside. It CLATTERS floor, useless. But that's
academic gnarled hand clamps Alex's throat.
ARCADE lifts Alex air SLAMS wall, pinning
there. He thrusts face hers.
ARCADE
YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
TOO LATE. AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP. YOU
SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART
FOR ME. I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF. THOSE
ARE THE RULES. BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT,
I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY
PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD. THANK-YOU, ALEX.
THANK-YOU SO MUCH.
ARCADE slowly squeezes throat Alex chokes, gasping air
isn't forthcoming. Tears eyes face turns red. She
tries pry bony, black fingers throat, can't...
HER P.O.V.
sees faces friends. Frozen. Unable help. Then
images swirl Alex begins lose consciousness.
ARCADE
YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX. YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.
ARCADE drops Alex ground, wraps hand hair drags
floor...
A DOORWAY
stands darkness. ARCADE rips open, revealing absolute emptiness
beyond. It's like doorway space, hole fabric reality.
It sucks air it, light...everything. It touches sort
primal fear. Gut instinct. You don't want place. Ever.
ALEX
(screaming)
No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She twists madly, trying pull away, ARCADE strong. He
shoves doorway. Her hands briefly latch
doorjamb. ARCADE violently kicks hands slip away. They slip
tumbles through.
ARCADE slams door shut.
ARCADE
GOODBYE, ALEX. IT'S BEEN REAL.
These words appear screen, "FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD"
CUT TO:
INT. MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY
Alex lands hallway floor, disoriented. Somewhere, hear
clock TICKING. But house silent, stark contrast
storm sounds moment ago.
THE HOUSE
looks like dream/flashback saw earlier. Everything white.
Bright dreamlike. Hyper reality. Alex looks and...
ANOTHER ALEX
sitting chair nearby, straight, hands clasped lap.
Reserved.
OTHER ALEX
Time. That's I think
anymore. It's like there's

The Alex vanishes. Now chair empty. Alex turns look

we've seen before. The words fade like phantoms...
MAN (V.O.)
So then?
ALEX (V.O.)
I'm past.
ALEX
(a whisper)
No ... oh ...
With building sense dread, Alex moves doorway. She
stops threshold, terrified.
INT. MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY
Everything looks normal first. A typical bedroom sunlight
streaming windows. A bed, made-up. Flowers vases.
Everything looks perfect.
We turn Alex. Ever slowly. Over right entranceway
bathroom. Over mother is...
...seated chair. dressed white radiating warmth!
ALEX'S MOM
Hi, honey.
HER MOTHER

Tears running freely Alex's face now.

Her mother looks ecstatic. And tears eyes. Joy,
reunion...it's unclear which.
ALEX'S MOTHER

Her mother stands Alex sees holding gun...no, gun,
hands. She raises Alex.
ALEX'S MOTHER

Alex time respond. A still-born scream frozen throat.
A split-second realization. And mother FIRES gun...
CRACK! The bullet hits Alex square forehead, snapping head
blood brain matter trail outward. The world spins
stop, like record player running down.
Alex killed instantly. Her body collapse, head thumping
unceremoniously carpeted floor.
HER EYES
open fixed infinity. No life here. Seems hard believe
was.
CUT TO:
INT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM --
ON ALEX'S FACE
There bullet-hole forehead, eyes
lifeless.
THE PEANUT GALLERY
Row row frozen faces. Are aware Alex died? Is
consciousness inside skulls?
ON ARCADE
crouches Alex's body. A smile creeps face.
ARCADE
OH ALEX. SO SORRY. BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,
I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME. MAYBE
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN.
He laughs.
ALEX'S BODY
begins decompose us, skin sinking shriveling up. In
moments, she's husk.
ARCADE rears back, turn away, catches
eye. He hears tiny BEEPING.
ALEX'S WRIST MONITOR
Remember stylized symbol woman? The said "FREE LIFE"
beneath it? Well disappears now.
There's sudden FLASH ARCADE spins around..

She DIVES forward, thrusting sword might. It sinks
ARCADE'S chest pushes further, burying hilt.
ARCADE lets loose terribly SCREAM we've heard. It literally
shakes world.
THE SWORD
glowing like molten lava. The heart-shaped hilt burns
monster's chest, spreading crackling entire body. His body
immersed now, vibrating like mad suddenly...
...ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND...
...he's gone. Like existed. The sword drops floor,
gun-metal gray now.
Alex stands moment, stunned, willing believe
she's won.
A NEON SIGN
drops down. It flashes "CONGRATULATIONS" again.
"CONGRATULATIONS".

fading out, signal lost. Her image stutters,
flickers and...
