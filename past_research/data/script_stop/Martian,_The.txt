piece antenna broke inside him.
That's bad.
Mark stumbles first-aid station. Grabs supplies.
Anesthetic. Syringe. Forceps. Needle. Suture thread.

TEDDY
How sure?
VINCENT
Nearly 100%.
ANNIE
Do understand shitstorm that's
hit us?
TEDDY
Annie, thing time.
(TO VINCENT)
Prove me.
VINCENT
(points images)
For starters, solar panels
cleaned.
TEDDY
They cleaned wind.
VINCENT
Look Rover 2. According logs,
Commander Lewis took Sol 17.
Plugged Hab recharge.
It's moved.
TEDDY
She forgotten log move.
VINCENT
Here's clincher. Check MDV.
It's taken apart. There's way
telling us.
(CONTINUED)

ANNIE
Why don't talk Lewis? Let's
CAPCOM ask directly right now.
Vincent shoots Teddy glance. After moment, Teddy
understands means.
TEDDY
No. If Watney alive...
don't want Ares 3 crew know.
ANNIE
What? How tell them?
TEDDY
They months
trip home. Space travel dangerous.
We need alert undistracted.
ANNIE
They think he's dead.
VINCENT
And they'd devastated
abandoned alive.
ANNIE
You're board this?
VINCENT
We protect crew. There's
anyway. Let
deal emotional trauma
they're trapped spaceship.
TEDDY
How handle public?
ANNIE
We twenty-four hours we're
required release pics.
TEDDY
We'll need release statement

TEDDY
He's alive. But math right,
he's gonna starve death long
help him.
(THEN)
I'm exactly looking forward
conversation.
Vincent's eyes drift images Mars.
VINCENT
Can imagine he's going

MARK (V.O.)
It's time start thinking long term.
The NASA mission Ares 4. It's
supposed land Schiaparelli
Crater, 3,200 away.
We Mark trace route position crater.
MARK (V.O.)
NASA presupplies mission years
advance, MAV there,
synthesizing fuel. In years
Hermes returns, I'll launch
there. Which means I gotta
crater.
EXT. HAB - DAY
Quick cuts. Mark rips (VERY large) battery Rover
1 drags Rover 2. Stares it. Where I
gonna this?
INT. HAB - NIGHT
Mark speaks directly camera.
MARK
But here's rub. I've got rovers
designed max distance 35

recharged Hab. That's problem A.
Problem B it'll me... roughly

If I use heater, it'll eat half

Let's assume Ms. Park didn't miss
