EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
An unparalleled set sheer mountains -- Colorado
Rockies. The peaks rise challenging half mile
valley -- wind-whipped snow mists mountains
like low fog. The tranquility broken helicopter
BLASTS view, fighting wind heads center
all.
Our CREDITS fly past magnificent range.
There sky-piercing peaks slope narrow, high
pinnacle -- steel, straight-up approaches
large plateaus. One mountains crystal lake
-- waterfall drains exits
middle mountain wall. Nearby, abandoned cable ladder
bolted wall, leading top.
BACK IN THE HELICOPTER
We man sitting doorway, looking --
INT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV
The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- us, looks
like field gray white.
FRANK (O.S.)
Nothing yet.
EXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT
The helicopter circles tallest mountain -- "The
Tower", separated lower equally formidable peak
chasm feet -- drops 3,500 feet below.
INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE
Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans mountain wall. MAGGIE
DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots helicopter storm
winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying
members Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team.
FRANK
Wait minute -- there's Hal.
(beat)
And date.
BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE
that's smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s)
"date", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), decked climbing gear.
Hal's aplomb suggests he's veteran climber -- Susan's
worried look shows isn't. Hal Susan huddle together,
cold, okay. Hal makeshift splint wrapped
lower leg, slow burning flare hand.
INSIDE HELICOPTER
Frank lowers glasses -- Maggie struggles wind.
MAGGIE
How look?
BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN
Hal, aware copter, looks it, smiling --
starts jerking flare.
FRANK (O.S.)
He's signalling "okay."
MAGGIE (O.S.)
Where's Gabe?
The POV dips -- there's somebody climbing below,
orange rescue jacket.
FRANK (O.S.)
Right he's supposed be.
CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER
This GABE WALKER (30s). In spite cold snow,
he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling tower safety
lines, he's times. That's
times. This Gabe lives for.
ON THE LEDGE
Gabe, there, finds fingertip-width handhold arm's
length -- grabbing it, pulls ledge
that's little tougher chinning
doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps couple,
tries light cigarette. The lighter sparks.
HAL
Excuse -- I know you're
salvation, -- think
rescue smoke
break?
Hal pulls box wooden matches lights Bogart
style, one-handed thumbnail, cupping hand shield
wind. Gabe bends -- familiar
routine. We know glance they've friends years.
GABE

Gabe finally grabs line, secures heavy piton,
hammers wall.
GABE
(to Susan)
This guy showing good time?
THE HELICOPTER
swings facing mountain -- Maggie lands
copter, spite winds, small plateau. Frank gets
secure wire -- there's lifeline spanning
chasm.
ON THE LEDGE
Gabe finishes anchoring line rock --
extinguishes cigarette snow, naturally, pockets
butt. Hal, propped wall, expertly rigs
seat harness legs -- Susan helps
splint, Gabe clips line.
GABE
Now, remember -- arms
legs vehicle

HAL
(laughing)
Fuck --
With that, Hal pulls hand-over-hand sloping
line -- Hal makes point looking --
HAL'S POV -- THE DROP
vertigo defined. Thirty feet straight down.
You stack World Trade Center towers
they'd shorter mountain high.
However --
HAL
lets overhead line claps hands face
mock horror -- quickly whizzes thirty feet
line, Frank catches pulls out. Hal
gets harness, checks stitch it, signals
thumbs-up, sends back.
THE LEDGE
Gabe, retrieves harness small attachment line,
gives Susan reassuring smile, she's still, sensibly,
scared. Gabe recovers harness, rigs Susan it,
meticulously re-checks it.
GABE
Ready?
(sees she's afraid)
Did tell time

SUSAN
He said gave bad oxygen mask

GABE
Well, he's bored

Susan nervously laughs.
GABE

Okay --
Gabe starts push line, grabs arm

Look me. Just looking --

GABE

If I did, I'd listen

Maggie slows rotor, eyes controls. Gabe's eyes

That meant said,

TRAVERS

There isn't hell lot

This protected shipment

thief. Those bills aren't

dollar bills easy pass? Who
fuck try?
Matheson hands Travers folder.
MATHESON
This guy might.
We look Travers' shoulder photos,
blurry, blown different surveillance pictures --
ERIC QUALEN.
TRAVERS
Who he?
MATHERS
(patient)
His name's Eric Qualen. One
East German spies got shut
reunification. The CIA issued
inter-agency warning right
wall came down. He's got
lose.
He's got international
connections rid bills like

supposed care?
MATHESON

We agents monitoring him.
These -- Gleason Quinones.
Their report said going
try shipment.
TRAVERS

MATHESON
(stopping him)
Did I "last" report? I think I
did. I mean fucking report.
These guys vanished.
TRAVERS
You sympathy, --
(exasperated)
There's reason things
way, right? Armored cars
hijacked. Trains derailed. But
flight. The
time ground
mint, Presidio runway
San Francisco. Either way,
shoot way past
couple thousand guards.
Matheson isn't convinced.
TRAVERS
If you're worried inside job,
forget it. I checked plane

Travers pulls tracking device size watchman

I haven't lost years.
And I'm scrubbing shipment

MATHESON

Who said stopping

I've tracking Qualen

Travers, angry, turns Wright. Wright clearly doesn't like
