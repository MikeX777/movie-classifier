SMITH

"Old West." To book writers,
it's "Wild West." To
businessmen, it's "Undeveloped
West." They we're backward

(snorts)
We don't water.
(a beat)
But place, us, West.

I wish they'd leave alone.
MACREEDY

SMITH
Burying cattle...?
MACREEDY

MACREEDY
See wild flowers? That means

SMITH
Sort of. Maybe figure

Macreedy smiles tiredly. He half turns Coley.
MACREEDY

He gets up, chili, sits stools away.
Coley straddles stool Macreedy vacated. He squirms

COLEY
This seat ain't comfortable.
MACREEDY
I afraid that.
COLEY
I think I'd like seat you're on.
SMITH
(to Macreedy, mildly)
He's changeable prairie fire.
MACREEDY

Suppose tell sit.
Coley opens mouth but, realizing

SMITH
Now why-ever want

MACREEDY

SMITH
I don't think that'll necessary.
You're scared you'll probably

COLEY
Before happens, couldn't I pick
fight I tied hand

Macreedy rises out. As passes Coley, Coley takes
limp left arm spins slowly firmly around.
The men face other.
COLEY
If I tied hands...?
Macreedy shakes free Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big
right fist streaks Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks,
weaving punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting
Coley's body. The momentum swing throws Coley
balance. As goes past Macreedy, stranger tugs
belt, twisting side. He plants left foot firmly

Coley place. He chops open hand

With motion, brings heel hand hard

cartilage shatters. Blood spills face. Following
through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone.
Macreedy's arm goes past astonished, wind-burned face,
finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks wrist
backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, face twisted pain
perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back.
He raises right shoulder inches. His bent right
arm drives like piston attached shoulder's lift.
Fist arm rigid piece limber

Smith, puzzled expression face, watches Coley fall.
He takes half step him. Macreedy looks Smith.
Smith stops. Macreedy's face wooden, trace
sullenness hard lines mouth. Working
methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes pocket
long, ugly knife. He snaps spring four-inch
blade leaps place. He looks knife hand

MACREEDY
(to Smith)
Wouldn't easier

MACREEDY

Where's answer?
Hastings silent. A brittle expression bemusement crosses
Smith's features.
SMITH
You expect answer -- wire

Macreedy's mouth compresses harsh grin.
SMITH
What's funny?
MACREEDY
Nothing. Just thought --
(his eyes turn
Hastings. Hastings
wilts)
-- thought dazzling purity...
Macreedy takes step Hastings. The telegraph agent
bounces away.
MACREEDY
(slowly)
You're jam, Hastings. You gave
telegram Smith.

You warty wretch! That's federal

MACREEDY
(to Smith)
You're deep, too.
(grins hard)
Like I said, it's getting tougher
tougher.
(to Tim)
Sheriff, you'd better

Tim hesitates, blinking eyes worriedly, shifting
stockinged foot other. Smith watches insolently
takes message Macreedy gestures
vaguely...
TIM
(to Smith)
I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith...
HECTOR
Don't jerk, Tim.
TIM
(to Smith, seriously)
Divulging information -- there's
law...
SMITH
Tim, you're pathetic.
TIM
(doggedly)
Could be. But I'm Sheriff.
SMITH
That's point. You're Sheriff
more. You lost job, you're
pathetic.
He reaches out, clawing badge Tim's chest. He jabs
Hector's vest.
SMITH
(to Hector)
All right, Sheriff. Take over.
DOC
You can't that!
SMITH
Can't I? I office. Now I

Hector moves elephantine bulk inches Macreedy...
HECTOR
Now. You want register complaint?
Macreedy doesn't answer. Hector takes message Tim's

HECTOR
To register complaint, boy, you've
got evidence. You got
evidence?
Macreedy doesn't answer.
HECTOR
You got big mouth, boy, makin'
accusations, disturbin' peace.
There's laws county protectin'
innocent folks big mouths. Why,
I'd hate to...
SMITH
(interrupting)
Hector...
(wearily)
Come on, Hector.
He walks out, new Sheriff strutting him,
Hastings wake. For moment Macreedy, Doc Tim
stand center lobby. Pete eyes non-
committally goes solitaire. He glances
then, moving cards purposeful sort
slowness, natural swiftness restrained
preoccupation men lobby.
Macreedy deep thought. Abstractedly tugs
collar repeats ritual lighting cigarette.
Tim's shoulders slumped. Humiliation corroded him,
flesh soul. Even Doc momentarily subdued; too,
feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks
good, ineffectual companions circumstance
haphazardly tossed way. He takes steps
suitcase, Doc Tim trailing him; Doc, want
better do; Tim, deep, inexpressible need
support. Macreedy takes untapped bottle whiskey
bag. He thumbs cork loose holds bottle
Tim. Tim takes drink.
The light clerk's desk goes on, aware
day gone night falling. The pressing, fierce
light drained lobby, leaving shadowy, silvery
dreariness. The shadows lengthened silver
tarnished darkness.
DOC
(hopefully)
It's right, Tim. We're licked
yet.
TIM
(numbly)
Ain't we? I am.
DOC
There comes time, Tim, man's

TIM
Not me. I'm useless, I know it.
DOC
(imploring)
No man useless, he's got
friend...
Pete comes desk, walking lamp

DOC
I'm friend, Tim.
TIM
Then let alone.
He hands Doc whiskey bottle.
DOC

He's going need

He downs snort, looks Pete, approaches them.
DOC
(contemptuously)
And useful men

As Pete turns lamp Doc, reacts
slightly Doc's words. His imperceptible grimace
lost Macreedy. Macreedy watches young man
continues light lamps...
TIM
(angrily)
Lemme alone, I tell ya!
Doc slams whiskey bottle nearby table.
DOC
I can't let alone! I can't let
alone! Don't understand
that?
(he turns Tim
Pete, unable
shake gaze.
Then, sadly, fiercely)
Four years ago terrible
happened here. We
it. Nothing. The town fell
sort settled melancholy,
people closed
eyes held tongues failed
test whimper.
Self-consciously Pete backed leans
outside clerk's desk. But can't
shut ears Doc saying...
DOC
Now terrible going

lucky we've given
second chance. And time I won't
close eyes, I won't hold tongue,
I'm needed I won't fail.
(almost harshly,
facing Tim)
And you!
Tim sighs, running hand forehead...
TIM
I got headache, I'm bewildered.
I hurt over.
MACREEDY
I know --
(unconsciously

bewildered, self-pity, afraid

(gesturing

And friend Smith tried

In sudden frustration, Pete grabs deck cards

started fire. The Jap came running
out. His clothes burning. Smith
shot him. I didn't know Smith

MACREEDY

Pete nods helplessly, bowing head. Macreedy sighs, looks
bottle hand, slowly puts table...
MACREEDY

His son...? Nobody knew

MACREEDY

Pete motionless, holding glass inches lips,
hypnotized Macreedy's voice, hard cold

MACREEDY
...And help --
barrel washes away murder!
Macreedy's hand shoots out, short, inexorable arc,
smashing palm shot glass. The whiskey bursts
spray, glass flies halfway room,
shattering lands solid. Pete
stunned, Doc perplexed, Macreedy's violence. They stare
him...
Macreedy's eyes murky. The creases brows
nose deep. His nostrils

MACREEDY
But maybe I'm wrong. Go -- drink.

You don't know it's

"Forgive me, I've wrong."
DOC
Take easy, Macreedy. Sit down.
MACREEDY
(turning him)
Sit down?! Or
kneel, beg pardon
raising touchy subject?
Pete squirms Macreedy's relentless attack.
PETE

You don't remind me. I've

MACREEDY
Well, that's mighty noble you.
You feel ashamed -- that's noble,

Macreedy grabs bottle, shoving table
