A tiny red streak zips sky, bursts faint,
ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER,
excited SHOUTS.
EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON
DESCENDING, PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling,

My turn! My turn! No, I next!
No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil,
I one? I want one!
PHIL
Guys, guys, please! This risky
stuff here. And I'm highly trained
professional.
Derisive GROANS kids, SHOUTS. Phil grins.
There's little danger NASA use recruiting
poster: he's messy, hyper. Phil waves hands
silence.
PHIL
Okay, okay! Uncle Phil launch
booster...
Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, tall, fit French woman,
walking fresh six-pack. She tosses beer
Phil catches it.
PHIL
...just soon completes
fuel intake.
ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE
Who grins, walking away Phil kids, begin
better sense scope party. We
big yard middle-class home Houston suburb.
DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel,
families -- gathered picnic tables spread-out
blankets. Lots red, white blue bunting, lots
balloons. We hear snatches MUSIC, country-flavored,
dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees tossed
about. A banner, strung trees, reads "BON VOYAGE,
MARS ONE!!!"
WILLIS
It'll months
Mars. Another year surface,
months back. That's
years...
Passing banner, Cote lobs beer astronaut,
NICHOLAS WILLIS, snags neatly. He's got arm
waist PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME,
ANGLE LINGERS two. Willis, young astronaut,
early 20s, recruiting poster material, knows
well.
WILLIS
I guess I'm trying is,
night Earth,
it's gonna precious memory
me. Y'know?
PRETTY GIRL
Nice try, Nick.
As Pretty Girl slips grasp, laughing,
walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open
beer, swigs it.
ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As swerves open-
pit barbecue, ASTRONAUTS gathered. Cote
paused here, too, distributing beers. SERGEI
KIROV, Russian cosmonaut, watching kids nearby
play game wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily
chef.
KIROV
Hey, Woody, Mars One crew won't
heading Earth till
days guys land base
camp Mars Two. That's pretty
good long rendezvous.
WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, big, rangy guy cowboy hat
Hawaiian shirt "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire
pig turning spit flames, Woody basting
smiles Malik.
WOODY
What suggesting, Sergei?
KIROV
Maybe bring baseball
bat. Yes? American baseball? Our
crews little
Solar System Series.
WOODY
Please. Half guys foreigners.
We'd crush you.
KIROV
No, no, equal crews. Three
men, woman. Same handicap.
He grins teasingly Cote, makes face him.
WOODY
Easy now, you're talking
wife.
(seeing approach)
And Terri happens
helluva shortstop.
DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes platter
corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, face attractive
alert, questing intelligence. She pauses kiss
Woody's cheek; there's wonderful, sexy spark them.
Then glances Kirov, business now.
TERRI
Fast pitch, steals, batter calls
strikes. Thousand bucks
interesting?
He's bit rattled cockiness, looks Cote,
smiles, nods cool agreement.
COTE
Eh bien. Winner all.
TERRI
Good.
(smiles sweetly
Kirov)
Bring balls.
The men ooooh this, busting Kirov Cote,
Terri moves on. Woody, watching go, thousand-watt
grin.
WOODY
You wanna know sad part?
Technically I outrank her. But
want peace Mars Two,
I'm gonna saying lot "Yes,

The laugh.
ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI dodges PACK OF KIDS -- run
her, shrieking happily - finally reaches
picnic table, ASTRONAUTS' WIVES opening containers
baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad.
1ST WIFE
...just sure I feel
NASA allowing couples
type mission together.
One women raises warning eyebrow, 1st
Wife turns, sees Terri setting platter.
1ST WIFE
(embarrassed)
Nothing personal, Terri. It's
that, well, it's kind funny
feeling staying
behind.
TERRI
(carefully neutral)
All research shows marriage
provide stability long
duration trips.
2ND WIFE
Then haven't studied
couples I've known.
Laughter this. Terri smiles politely -- doesn't
common women -- moving on.
ANGLE LINGERS wives, watch slight

Mars...
She shakes head, awed thought. The nod
agreement, following glance...
In distance, lone MALE FIGURE stands garage,
them, facing parked cars, vans, SUVs
stretch driveway street. Another
figure, WOMAN, seen approaching him.
CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early
30s, attractive -- reaches husband. LUKE
GRAHAM, mid 30s, lean, fit body astronaut,
restless intellect scientist. He's unaware
approach touches shoulder. He looks
apologetic smile.
DEBRA
He's coming, Luke.
LUKE
Jim deserves this, too. All
friends here. And it's
night.
DEBRA
(gently)

He looks her, moved. She summons smile. He slides
arms waist, kisses forehead.
LUKE
I love you, Deb.
DEBRA
I love too, baby. But maybe
spend time Bobby.
LUKE
Yeah. I will. Where he?
DEBRA
Up fort.
He kisses again, goes. Debra's eyes follow him,
mixture pride sadness.
ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away garage,
EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON
Luke moves crowd. Phil kids
shooting rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.
In corner yard, it's quieter, passes
Willis, who's sitting blanket, murmuring soulfully
PRETTY GIRL #2.
WILLIS
Deep space lonesome. So cold.
But I guess I'll memories
warm...
Luke shakes head. Willis incorrigible. Finally
reaches tall redwood playset. He looks ladder.
A SMALL BOY sits platform tower, arms
knees, staring stars. A telescope rests nearby
tripod. He looks lonely.
Luke climbs up, sits wooden deck him.
BOBBY, 7, glances dad, idol,
sky.
BOBBY
Who's gonna read now,
bedtime?
Luke surprised question. A pause.
LUKE
Mommy will.
BOBBY
I like it. Now we're
gonna finish book.
His voice unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting tears.
Luke moved. Another brief silence.
LUKE
Well, I'll tell what. I've
thinking that. And I
thought -- 'bout I bring
copy?
(Bobby looks him)
Then night, I am,
I'll read little bit it.
And I'll know Mommy,

reading together. 'Cause I
don't know you, I'm pretty
anxious 'ol Ben Gunn
got marooned island. What
d'you say?
Bobby manages smile. He nods, feeling little better.
Luke proud son's courage.
LUKE
Good deal. Can I hug?
Bobby's arms father's neck. He hugs Luke
fiercely, Luke hugs back. His eyes,
young shoulders, brimming love impending absence.
Then, distance, sound APPROACHING CAR.
They turn.
An open Jeep coming street. Its DRIVER alone.
Luke's expression changes. Recognition, happiness.
EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON
The Jeep stops, electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver
climbs wearily, reaching seat, comes
champagne bottle, hastily decorated ribbon.
The PARTY SOUNDS drifting way, hesitates
moment, gather himself. He starts gamely
party, pauses again.
Debra Graham stands nearby lawn, waiting. She
smiles tentatively.
JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages smile return. He
dark circles eyes, clothes look slept in.
Yet sense, sadness, kind quiet
competence man, unforced authority; he's natural
leader.
Debra hurries forward, arms, hugs her. They
separate, looking other. Her eyes shining.
DEBRA
We afraid wouldn't come.
MCCONNELL
I caught whiff barbecue.
After I helpless.
DEBRA
All way Galveston?
MCCONNELL
Something like that.
(she smiles)
It's night, Deb. I didn't want
spoil it.
DEBRA
Spoil it? He's going crazy
looking you.
Over shoulder sees Luke approaching, arm
Bobby. The men look other, bond
strong needs words. Finally Luke smiles.
LUKE
C'mon. A lot folks
gonna mighty glad you.
McConnell comes him, accompanied Debra,
OUT OF FRAME, heading
party. ANGLE HOLDS parking area, we...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)
All parked cars vans gone now, two:
McConnell's Jeep Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis,
go, departing motorcycle. Perched
him, arms waist, PRETTY GIRL #3. They
zoom away, darkened neighborhood.
EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT
The yard nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner
torn loose end flutters limply. Here
napkin blows ground.
In distance, THREE FIGURES sit ground,
waning barbecue pit, sipping beers.
CLOSER ON THIS TRIO
As Woody shoves piece wood flames. For
moment he, McConnell, Luke silent, staring
sparks rise stars -- red gold dots
mingling silver ones.
WOODY
(abruptly)
I wish going. Together.
The intensity voice surprises others,
Woody himself. Luke glances McConnell. An awkward beat.
LUKE
Then you've got short memory. Think
second
week lunar training.
WOODY
Oh, you're gonna bring

LUKE
(laughing)
I'm trying remember, let's see,
scored lowest
ranking there?
WOODY
You can't let --
LUKE
Oh, man, commanders,

Mars together, wouldn't
fuel lift egos.
WOODY
(laughs)
Bullshit, would've great
crew.
MCCONNELL
That gonna happen. I
teamed Maggie,
chalkboard jockies. You

LUKE
Listen him. Mr. Cover-of-Time
Magazine!
WOODY
Yeah, landed crippled Block
II Shuttle?
LUKE
Yeah, scored highest
lunar rankings?
WOODY
Let go, Luke.
MCCONNELL
(smiles)
Sure, I little noise. But
putting footprints Mars?
Nah. That's guys who...
(looks Luke)
...wrote Ph.D. thesis
colonize place. And guys who...
(looks Woody)
...read science fiction
kid wear little Flash
Gordon rocketships necks.
He grabs playfully Woody's neck. Woody smacks hand
away, laughing.
WOODY
You read damn science fiction
books I did! You're
man wear jewelry!
He pulls shirt little Flash Gordon rocketship
emblem hanging chain, waggles tauntingly
McConnell, Luke McConnell laugh.
WOODY
You want Flash. You know want
him. Well you'll come
me!
Luke grabs Woody's arm McConnell better shot
emblem, Woody cuffs hands away, laughing.
McConnell, watching horseplay, shakes head.
MCCONNELL
God, would've loved
clowns. Just time.
He tries smile, face reddens. Then
chest heaving struggles control emotions.
Woody sees this, reaches reassuring hand, McConnell
shakes off, rises abruptly. He turns them,
walking away steps.
Woody Luke exchange worried glance.
EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT
McConnell Luke watch Woody starts Corvette.
McConnell regained composure.
LUKE
Hey, Woodrow, isn't time
donated thing museum?
Woody revs engine, ROARS lustily. He grins.
WOODY
Internal combustion, boys. Accept
substitutes.
Luke laughs. Woody looks McConnell.
WOODY
Jim, there's ever... there's
Terri I --
MCCONNELL
I'm okay. Really. Thanks.
Woody reaches shake Luke's hand.
WOODY
See I Mars, Luke.
Don't solve mysteries

WOODY
You got it.
With final glance McConnell, Woody slips car
gear. McConnell Luke watch drives away. A silence.
Luke glances old friend, growing serious. We
sense he's waiting night chance this.
LUKE
Should've mission, Jim.
Yours Maggie's.
McConnell, looking Woody's car, still.
LUKE
None wanted Mars way
did. Not Woody. Twelve
years hoping assignment,
training --
MCCONNELL
That's now.
LUKE
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick --
hadn't pulled
rotation care --
McConnell turns him, eyes flashing danger. He
tolerate pity. Luke sees presses on.
LUKE
No, I'm gonna this. I
it...
(pause)
I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled
step way.
Never wanted beat anybody bad
life. But like this...
Jim, I'd second,
bring Maggie us.
McConnell deeply moved, moment doesn't trust
voice.
MCCONNELL
I know that, Luke. You don't

it.
LUKE
(pause)
Take care yourself.
MCCONNELL
Yeah. You too.
Luke nods. They grab hands second, let go. Luke
walks house. McConnell watches
moment, turns, walks Jeep. He opens
door, pauses. He turns. Looks --
EXT. NIGHT SKY
A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars
itself, tantalizing prize. But now, distant
ever. For him, perhaps, attained.
CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE
As thoughts going him. After moment
looks
HIS SHOES
And sandy verge yard.
MCCONNELL'S EYES
Are map complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite
yearning. Gently, bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE
And sets again, making careful, deliberate footprint
sandy soil...
OMITTED
Sequence omitted original script.
EXT. MARS. CHRYSE PLANITIA. DAY
Instantly we're hurled immense, stunning LANDSCAPE,
mysterious vivid fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A
vast plain rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders
size houses, tossed hands gods. Twin
moons hanging salmon-pink sky. On horizon, towering,
craggy peaks. And, center -- sign life --
small, mysterious, moving puff dust.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted original script.
EXT. MARS. DAY
CLOSER ANGLE small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic
vehicle ambles INTO FRAME, jouncing orange Martian
soil, pausing snuffle sensors occasionally
interesting rock. Lettering reads "ARES-8."
SUPER TITLE: "MARS. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. EIGHT MONTHS LATER."
Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning
focus, intrigued OFFSCREEN --
higher, distant target. The little fellow quivers
excitement.
EXT. MARS. TIU VALLIS. DAY
A one-man ATV ROVER waits background, dry
streambed, Luke, EVA spacesuit, swings clawed
rock hammer multi-layered, sedimentary rock face.
Reddish dust coats bulky white suit. Despite bulk,
moves easily light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's).
A hunk rock breaks off, Luke examines closely,
holding clear faceplate. He's happy,
absorbed work, RADIO CRACKLES.
COTE
Luke, read me?
LUKE
Yeah, Renee.
COTE
Luke, I got ARES-8 line and...
Well, think you're gonna wanna
yourself.
Luke, reluctant break work, intrigued.
LUKE
Copy that.
As Luke turns away, headed rover
WE PULL WIDE
To REVEAL STAGGERING PROSPECT, seen time:
Valles Marineris, planet-creasing slash. So wide,
deep, boggles mind: earth reach New
York L.A.

Sequence omitted original script.
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY
The crew Mars One - Kirov, Willis, Cote -- joined
Luke, gathered display monitors. They're NASA
jumpsuits; Hab artificial atmosphere, enhanced
gravity, heat. All captivated see. ON A
VIDEO SCREEN
We low-angle image elongated, rubble dirt-
covered MOUNTAIN. Hard tell scale, looks huge.
What's striking, however, WHITE PEAK barely
protruding rubble two-thirds way
mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness clear contrast
typical rust-orange surrounding rubble; what's
more, strange little peak displays oddly-smooth,
multi-planed symmetry.
LUKE
What hell that?
COTE
No idea, boss.
LUKE
Where it?
Cote glances others. They're smirking,
share secret joke Luke's on.
WILLIS
You don't wanna know.
LUKE
C'mon, what's funny? Gimme
coordinates.
He leans read digital gauge, Cote covers
hand, enjoying tease.
COTE
Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude
9 degrees west.
LUKE
The Plains Cydonia. So?
(pause)
Oh no. You're telling --
They laugh shoe drops. Luke's expression
incredulous, exasperated.
COTE
Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault,
picked today's sector.
KIROV
Hey, c'mon! We've got scientific
duty check thing out.
Luke sits, taking Ares remote control Cote.
They watch fine tunes image, trying
success coax resolution.
LUKE
Great. That's great. The anomaly
hit, it's gotta
place guaranteed NASA look
ridiculous... You know books
written damned
mountain?
COTE
The Egyptians there.
KIROV
No, Amazons.
WILLIS
No, little green men!
LUKE
And couple lousy
impact craters happen look like
eye sockets. If gets out, we'll
UFO kook Earth spouting
o'clock news... C'mon,
people, gimme read here. Is
cinder cone?
KIROV
Nah, smooth. Too angular. Volcanic
upwelling?
COTE
No fissures. No caldera.
LUKE
It's upwelling, sure. But
maybe volcanic...
The look him, puzzled. Luke leans closer,
growing excitement. He points screen.
LUKE
Look color. And shiny
is? I swear that's ice...
COTE
This far south?
WILLIS
Impossible. You can't ice
latitude. Not unless...
They look other, Luke's excitement leaping
them. They're trembling.
WILLIS
Oh God.
LUKE
How far away it?
KIROV
Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take
minutes there.
LUKE
(considers moment)
Let's send packet Micker. Then
we'll check out.
EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY
AIRLOCK DOORS
Slide back, REVEALING crew EVA suits, carrying gear.
They walk to...
THE FOUR-MAN ROVER
The astronauts climb hatch. The
pulls shut locks latches. We Cote
Luke check screens press buttons. Luke
puts rover drive.
WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY
As rover moves rocky surface, dust kicking
wheels, exterior glimpse
Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like huge tuna
conical section; connects separate,
inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's OXYGEN STILL,
PROPELLANT PLANT, and, side, couple
meters distant, massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle),
arrived separate, unmanned flight.
Rows SOLAR PANELS, arrayed ground, AMERICAN
FLAG pole, man-height, complete scene.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY
A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT drifting
majestically Earth. The main hull displays NASA
U.N. flag decals.
SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION
CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG."
We MOVE IN station's segments,
dedicated entirely (as labels
insignias) Mars Program: Control Room, Training
Living Quarters, Vehicle Docking Launch Area,
Mars Two positioned eventual flight. We
hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, speakers.
LUKE
This truly anomalous formation.
Looks like we've seen
far. The structure appears
crystalline, angle
displayed ARES-8 ...
INT. MMCR. DAY
On large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, Luke Mars
One crew, sitting kitchen table Hab,
finishing lunch taping VIDEO MESSAGE.
LUKE
(grins)
We're trying nuts
here, -- think there's
good chance extrusion
subsurface, geothermal
column water. And we're right...
He looks crew. They beam like cats ate canaries.
LUKE
...then we've key
permanent human colonization.
IN THE MMCR
There's EXCITED BUZZ assembled TECHNICIANS,
FLIGHT ENGINEERS, SCIENTISTS. This fantastic,
epochal discovery.
MCCONNELL
Sits center console, wearing headset. He's
Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), manner
brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans
instructions.
MCCONNELL
Tell geology hydrology need
scramble this. Full-court press.
The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing
intense excitement him, stares

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
The rover meters away moving fast TOWARDS
CAMERA. We BOOM DOWN REVEAL Ares-8, faithfully
holding point, like Irish Setter, video snout
WHIRRING OUT.
The rover drives slows stop nearby. The hatch
door cracks open dust vents out. The door opens
way astronauts climb out. They look
awe. We hear voices ON RADIOS.
KIROV
Jesus Christ...
THE MYSTERIOUS PEAK
Gleams sun, dazzling white, facets planed
smooth architect drawn them. It pierces
topmost rubble near end big mountain --
isolated, butte-like giant, stretching miles left
right them.
THE ASTRONAUTS
Walk mountain. There's deep, low,
staccato tone intruding headsets.
LUKE
Anyone hear that?
COTE
Yeah. What it?
WILLIS
Sounds like antenna's
phase.
LUKE
Can fix it?
WILLIS
Hey, skip, I fix anything.
LUKE
Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's
break radar,
thing's of.
As jobs, deep, barely audible rumbling
tone continues.
INT. SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY
MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, artificial gravity
busy station, RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches
opposite direction. Beck tough, crewcut, PR-savvy
head NASA Mars Program (ID'd tag),
he's leading covey U.N. AMBASSADORS tour.
The ambassadors, sexes, nations, races,
look excited schoolkids.
BECK
...and Mars Mission
Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I
understand comm packet incoming
Mars One Base Camp,
interesting.
He opens doors, ushering flock inside.
INT. MMCR. DAY
The ambassadors enter, oohing ahhing impressive
array gadgetry personnel, especially big
screen. Some start taking souvenir snaphots. The
NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns Beck, whispering curiously.
AMBASSADOR
That man there. He's charge?
BECK FOLLOWS HIS GLANCE TO
MCCONNELL
Who surrounded KNOT OF TECHNICIANS,
giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, depart,
like eager bees.
BECK
Smiles indulgently ambassador's misunderstanding.
BECK
No, actually, that's Jim McConnell,
CAPCOM. Our voice link
astronauts? Jim's manned
Mars program inception.
One real pioneers.
AMBASSADOR
Will going Mars, too?
BECK
Ah, no. This close gets.
ON THE SCREEN
Luke crew finished eating, clearing
away dishes leftovers.
LUKE
...anyway, that's it. We'll
send packet back.
Cote clears throat, gives Luke look. The
barely conceal grins.
LUKE
Oh, right. One thing. Today
special day good friend
ours, I know he's right
now.
McConnell looks screen, worried. What's Luke to?
LUKE
Now, hates fuss
made, I won't mention name...
A look relief comes McConnell.
LUKE
...because thing
world I'd want embarrass
like Jim McConnell.
McConnell winces -- Dear God, -- as, screen, Kirov
appears OFF CAMERA holding cupcake burning
candle stuck it, Mars One crew starts SINGING
"Happy Birthday" him. Loudly. And off-key.
LUKE
C'mon, Micker weasels, sing!
Soon MMCR singing --
jolly ambassadors -- noticeable exception
Beck, stiffens unhappily. McConnell mortified.
LUKE
(sings line, then,
CAMERA:)
Hey, Ray! Take look him! Is
red fake "I'm-
a-good-sport" grins?
Beck looks McConnell, red face
fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.
LUKE
And hey, guys, check Ray!
Does "This-
wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?
Indeed, Beck's smile thin, sour, disapproving.
LUKE
Nothing it, Ray!
We're million miles away!
Luke crew finish singing song. Luke raises
cupcake toast.
LUKE
Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make wish!
He crew lean in, blow candle. They laugh
applaud, wave goodbye.
LUKE
Catch soon. Take care,
buddy. End transmission.
Luke reaches out, turns OFF CAMERA, display screen
GOES BLACK.
Beck turns, gaze locking McConnell's. He's annoyed,
violation protocol McConnell's
fault. McConnell returns stare coolly.
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
Cote stands display screen mounted rover. Kirov
big radar gun tripod, pointing mountain.
Luke turns Cote.
LUKE
Well? What's there?
COTE
(puzzled)
Je ne sais pas. I... I think there's
wrong equipment.
LUKE
What?
COTE
I mean, can't right. It says...
says there's metal there.
Luke doesn't understand. He walks look display
screen.
COTE
(points)
There's ten, meters rubble
sand, then... solid metal.
LUKE
That doesn't sense. You're
reading vein ore.
COTE
(shakes head)
No. It's mountain.
The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.
LUKE
Nick, problem
antenna interfering?
WILLIS
Could be.
LUKE
(to Cote Kirov)
Try closer power. I'll
watch screen.
INT. MMCR. DAY
McConnell taping audio message sent Mars
rest MMCR looks on. Beck gone. So U. N.
ambassadors.
MCCONNELL
Ah, we're pretty stoked
formation spotted, Mars
One. The folks geology
hydrology rooms going
images comparing
photomap they've got.
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
Cote Kirov close foot mountain,
resetting radar gun tripod. The deep vibrating
tone continues.
Luke distance away, rover. He looks Willis,
who's working rover's antenna.
LUKE
Nick, coming antenna?
WILLIS
Goin' fast I can, boss.
Cote Kirov having trouble switches
radar gun. They turn Luke Willis.
KIROV
Hey, Nick. Come stupid I
am. I can't work.
Willis looks Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis starts
radar gun.
INT. MMCR. DAY
McConnell handed slip paper, glances it.
MCCONNELL
Medical wants remind
you're days late blood

Just them, okay?
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
Willis, Cote, Kirov radar gun running.
KIROV
All set here, chief.
Luke sidles display screen rover.
LUKE
Okay. Crank juice let's

INT. MMCR. DAY
McConnell checks clipboard list updates.
MCCONNELL
I think that's business.
But personal note, advised
that, ah, sing worth

LAUGHTER MMCR.
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
Luke watches screen rover, as, mound...
KIROV
Flips switch radar gun, swivels muzzle
slowly near slope mountain. We hear
feel radar signal. The immediate result
pulsing tone we've hearing suddenly stops.
LUKE
Looks display screen. A puzzled expression.
LUKE
Why stop?
A split-second later, gets answer. We hear WHOOSH,
mighty rushing wind,
A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER
Starts swirl rise, straight
mountain, center. As swirls, cylinder picks
debris -- pebbles, sand -- sediment-encrusted surface

And then, moment, passed
