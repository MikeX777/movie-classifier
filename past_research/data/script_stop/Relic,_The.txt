EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT
A taxi careens narrow roadways breakneck speeds.
INT. TAXI - NIGHT
In seat WHITTLESLEY. Early 40's, wreck
handsome man. Unshaven. Sweat stained. Rail thin. Scratches
arms, fresh scar cheek. As taxi roars downhill
harbor, Whittlesley leans seat. (Italics indicate
Portuguese subtitled)
WHITTLESLEY
Faster! We won't it.
DRIVER
You want die?
Whittlesley pulls A KNIFE, puts driver's jugular vein.
WHITTLESLEY

Sweat pouring brow, driver re-doubles speed.
EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT
The taxi swerves corner, nearly crashing fruit cart,
flies sight.
EXT. HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT
Light rain obscures bulky outlines tethered freighters. We hear
faint laughter leavened Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music
waterfront bars. One smaller boats, SANTA LUCIA,
loading TAXI fishtails halt.
Whittlesley gets out, sees boat dock. His face floods
relief.
WHITTLESLEY
Thank God.
He tosses handful bills driver's lap, sprints
pier driver shouts curses Portuguese. Whittlesley
shoves past dock hands load goes Santa Lucia.
The boat's engines churn life.
WHITTLESLEY
I need speak captain!
Where he?
The sailors hold Whittlesley back.
WHITTLESLEY
Get hands me! I'm trying
save lives, fools!
Several crew members murmur word "loco". Hearing commotion,
squat man wearing billed hat smoking cigar approaches. CAPTAIN
FRANCO.
FRANCO

Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically. Franco looks men.
FRANCO
Loco.
WHITTLESLEY
No! I'm crazy! As God
witness, I'm telling truth.
Franco barks order sailors grab Whittlesley
arms. They start lead shore.
WHITTLESLEY
Don't this! You believe
me. Your lives danger.
The sailors laugh. But super-human strength born
desperation, Whittlesley throws off. He pulls wallet.
WHITTLESLEY
Cash. Cash, see? American money.
Whittlesley throws money deck. The breeze scatters
bills bow men, including Captain Franco,
scramble money, chattering Portuguese. While
occupied, Whittlesley slips unnoticed disappears deck.
INT. HOLD - SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT
Whittlesley ducks cages goats, boxes farm equipment,
movements jerky panic. As continues searching, camera
moves past him, darkness hold. We hear Whittlesley
mumbling low, ragged breaths. At boat
camera finds...
A STACK OF CRATES... clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. Move
as... The CRATES VIBRATE. The boat started move!
Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.
WHITTLESLEY

Too late. He turns run deck stops, sniffs air.
A look desperation fills eyes. With hand pulls THE
KNIFE, unexpectedly puts HIS OWN NECK. Better kill
face comes next. The knife touches...
A NECKLACE TWO ARROWS, gold, silver.
Whittlesley stares wide-eyed blackness hold. The goats
start BLEATING blind panic. A shaft moonlight comes
porthole boat turns. The moonlight falls
THE CRATES. Whittlesley's eyes lock inches
them, drawn inexorably closer... closer...
WHITTLESLEY

He begins mumbling prayer.
MOVE IN ON HIS EYES... filled dread falls knees,

Margo's voice catches again. Pendergast reaches handkerchief

others. His theory came first.
PENDERGAST
What Whittlesley arrived
tepui monster there? Was
desperate create one?
MARGO
I don't understand.
PENDERGAST
Something came autopsy

MARGO
My God. Then animal.
PENDERGAST
I don't think so. I think

PENDERGAST
Would mind showing me?

Something large TRACKING HER! There's doubt.
Overcome blind panic, Margo turns runs. She passes

FROCK
This it. Can read

long, vicious, CLAWS!
D'AGOSTA
Holy shit.
Frock stares amazement, shaken. He runs finger deep
ruts.
FROCK
Something tried

PENDERGAST
And failed. These doors solid

D'AGOSTA
The lid crate scratched
claw marks, like door.
As D'Agosta studies lid, brittle, water damaged envelope slips
out. D'Agosta picks up. The envelope bears imprint TWO
ARROWS, silver overlaid GOLD.
D'AGOSTA
Look. It's kind letter.
FROCK
(excited)
May I that?
D'Agosta hands letter Frock.
FROCK
It's John. Those arrows

Frock stops, looks D'Agosta Pendergast. His face flushes
thrill.
FROCK
Did hear that? My God. He says
Mbwun real!
D'AGOSTA
(snorts)
Pardon French, bull shit.
FROCK
This scratches... isn't
proof!
PENDERGAST
I think scratches
scare us. Perhaps lead
note.
Pendergast looks dark corridors.
PENDERGAST
You said John Whittlesley
study blueprints
museum.
FROCK
Yes.
PENDERGAST
Are hidden rooms
staircases? Places
hide?
FROCK
Not really. Just sub-basement.
D'Agosta Pendergast exchange look.
PENDERGAST
Where that?
FROCK
I don't know. It walled over. No

PENDERGAST
You said plans

small moving van, partially loaded contents Frock's
office, sits waiting. Frock delves boxes
Pendergast D'Agosta look on.
FROCK
I know they're somewhere. It's
good thing caught movers
time. They're nineteen century
blueprints museum

regular basement,
linked city sewer. I
know flooded

precious books.
Frock continues unload boxes, scattering things right left.
It's amazing assortment paraphernalia. A collection

JONATHAN
The dogs picking something,
Mr. Pendergast.
The dogs start barking animation, sniffing wall. Pendergast
studies blueprints flashlight, moves spot. There's
seen. He shines flashlight water-stained,

pushes back. It's door!
INT. STAIRWELL - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY
They enter dank stairwell brick stairs. Water drips

DEPUTY ONE
What this? A dungeon?
Jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps dogs' leashes

shoulders. Then follow animals, descend inky
stairwell.
INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - DAY
The place looks like control room nuclear power plant. Two
SECURITY GUARDS monitor battery closed-circuit screens. D'Agosta
accompanied pompous head security, IPPOLITO. Clearly
Ippolito feels D'Agosta pissing territory he's trying
assert control.
IPPOLITO
This huge police presence tonight
isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll
scare people off. I handle
security scenes
system. It's state art.
D'AGOSTA
The cops non-negotiable,
Ippolito. Why don't tell
space station works.
IPPOLITO
It's fool proof, basically. I
designed thing myself.
Every valuable object Museum
carries small electronic chip. If
anything's moved inch,
alarm pinpointing
exact location attempted
theft.
D'AGOSTA
That's great you're stopping
burglar. Not goal here. Are
motion detectors?
IPPOLITO
In exhibition room. The
museum's divided cells.
The reception exhibit
cell five. We arm motion
detectors cells four,
seal perimeter
doors.
D'AGOSTA
That leave exit
hundreds people. You'd
violating regulation
books. We'll guard perimeter
men engage motion
detectors cells. One
question. I big hole. If
entire thing run
computer, happens power
fails?
IPPOLITO
(snorts)
You don't know computers,
Lieutenant. There safeguards
built in. We back-up systems
redundancies. There's way
computers fail.
INT. PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY
Margo, Kawakita Frock studying contents crate.
FROCK
I can't help thinking there's
Pendergast

MARGO
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant
press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
FROCK
Let plant press.
Frock opens plant press sees specimen inside.
MARGO
What it?
FROCK
I'm sure. As know,
Kothoga lived outside civilization

MARGO
Whatever is, common
tepui. John packing

FROCK
You're right.
Kawakita lifts bit fibers, Frock.
FROCK
They're curiously fleshy.
KAWAKITA
And smell delicious.
Kawakita TAKES NIBBLE.
KAWAKITA
Taste great.
FROCK
I wouldn't mouth

FROCK
They're eggs.
INT. SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

JONATHAN
They've got something.
PENDERGAST
Keep light up. I can't see.
The dogs strain pull forward, sniffing air ahead. The deputies
raise shotguns deeper darkness. The
flashlight beams streak crazily directions, barely penetrating
gloom. Suddenly dogs break terrifying BAYING
bounces walls.
PENDERGAST
Shut up!
JONATHAN
Heel Argo! Hobbes! Heel!
The dogs drag Jonathan forward, paying attention, foaming
mouth. Jonathan frightened.
JONATHAN
They're going crazy! I need help!
Too late. As Jonathan tries grab collars, dogs LEAPS

JONATHAN
Holy mother, that?
A goatish odor envelops all.
DEPUTY ONE

A SCUFFLING sound claws dragging brick heard followed
ROAR. The men freeze. The dog leaps twists
excitement. In confusion breaks free! It tears
dog, disappearing darkness. Now Jonathan wild-eyed.
JONATHAN
No! Hobbes!
The deputies terrified, retreat. The darkness stifling,
claustrophobic. The flashlights small help. Pendergast
remains dead calm. His voice cool commanding.
PENDERGAST
Forget dogs. You two,

No answer. The rumbling continues, growing louder. Then dark object
appears. It comes rolling hallway, bounces

MARGO
It's reptilian.
FROCK

MARGO
(cautious)
Let's jump conclusions. This
egg belong number
reptiles, Dr. Frock.
FROCK
(excited)
Come on, Margo. We're verge
huge. Let's consider
possibility,
us, room. What John
right. I mean, if? And
sent egg monster
crates. When got
museum, hatched.
MARGO
Several problems theory.
For thing, egg intact.
For another, according
Pendergast, crates shipped
boat. Everyone board
killed like Beauregard. If
thing hatched mid-ocean,
go?
Frock answer. Greg gestures screen.
KAWAKITA
I guess you're interested
plant anymore, chemical
analysis done. Frock reads
Greg's shoulder.
FROCK
"Genus: Unknown. Family: Unknown.
Order: Unknown. Phylum: Unknown.
Cripes, Margo, me?
Is animal funky
shrub?"
(to Kawakita)
I you've programming
vocabulary again.
MARGO
(points hexagonal symbol)
Look this. An ambyloid reovirus
protein. That explains
computer's confused. The plant's
infected virus.
FROCK
That's unusual. Many plants
carry viruses. Like burls
Maple trees.
MARGO
But virus normally codes
viruses. This one's making human
animal proteins. Listen this.
(reads)
"Glycotetraglycine collagenoid.
Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4-
monoxytocin supressin hormone."
KAWAKITA
These plant fibers loaded
hormones!
MARGO
What kind hormones?
Kawakita pulls heavy book shelf. The Encyclopedia
Biochemistry, thumbs page reads.
KAWAKITA
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone
secreted human hypothalamus
gland."
MARGO
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
The tension rising room. Frock takes book, looks

FROCK
A hormone secreted human

human brain!
KAWAKITA
So what?
MARGO
Pendergast told killer
extracts eats hypothalamus
thalamus victim's brains!
KAWAKITA
(pales)
Eats them?
MARGO
Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard

crates secure storage,
reach. The killer
couldn't them, got
best thing.
FROCK
