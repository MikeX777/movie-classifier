1 TITLE SEQUENCE
In darkness, blood-curdling cacophony: squeal
unoiled winches, rasp hooks razors
sharpened; worse, howl tormented
souls. Above din particular victim yells
mercy - mixture tears roars rage.
By degrees incoherent pleas drowned
surrounding tumult, warning
voice pierces confusion afresh - time
reduced naked scream.
And sound, image.
A house: NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, old,
storey, late Victorian house, gaunt trees lining
overgrown garden. Its curtains drawn,
newspaper window. The titles begin
run, approach house driveway.
We inside, hallway. The cries
louder now.
Room room, explore house,
titles continue run. It left
years, furniture remains,
covered dust-sheets. On mantelpiece room,
plaster saint. In kitchen, evidence life
here. Opened tins; bread; bottles spirits;
glass.
We upstairs, gliding corridor
lower landing. The din furious now. On
floor room, makeshift bed: blankets strewn;
open suitcase; liquor.
We flight approach room upper
landing, door ajar. The light
swings backwards forwards, spilling
passageway.
As reach door, screams halt
abruptly.
We hear bell now, pealing
steadily opening sequence.
As door, titles end.
2 INT. TORTURE ROOM NIGHT
The bare bulbs room we've entered swing violently,
disorienting us. There chains - dozens -
disappearing darkness ceiling:
swinging forth. Some end hooks,
pieces skin sinew adhering; serrated,
simply drip blood.
The bell tolls on.
On blood-spattered floor, box, inches
square, resembles elaborate Chinese puzzle
box. Later, we'll learn function.
It's called Lament Configuration, it's
way raise Hell. LITERALLY. For now, remains
enigma.
A hand, flesh systematically pierced needles,
reaches picks box up.
In close elaborate construction
is, sliding panels mysterious
chambers. It open present, polished
innards exposed. Out it, banal melody, played
hidden mechanism. The hands, belong
demons - CENOBITE - box.
CENOBITE
(unseen)
It's ...
Delicately, hands begin reconstruct box,
sliding well-oiled parts place,
tune simplifying manoeuvre.
The room getting darker. The chains disappearing
gloom.
We tantalizing glimpses figures, turning
light fading darkness. We catch
sight monstrous faces, briefest
moments. Then they're gone.
The box returned unopened condition.
The sounds fade tune box,
bell.
It tolls final panel box slid
place.
The light stops swinging. The panel clicks. The tune
stops.
At last, long shot room. At far end
window covered yellowed newspapers. There
dust settling air.
Otherwise empty.
The bell fades.
It's happened here.
Except ...
Somewhere, quietly, creaking
sound floorboards, low, agonized gasp
thing barely alive.

early forties, attractive man lost
edge recent years. He looks harassed; smirks

The door Torture Room pushed open. JULIA
steps inside.
39 INT. LOWER LANDING DAY

above. JULIA's behaviour puzzles her, she's
waste time thinking hard it.
She starts downstairs again.
40 INT. TORTURE ROOM DAY
We odd, hovering point view JULIA,
steps inside room. Something
atmosphere distresses her.
There scratching sound. She looks down. A
wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls
edge skirting board. She crosses
window, tears away little spy-hole
aged newspaper.
From downstairs, voices bed-movers.
1ST MAN
Have got it?
2ND MAN
I've got it. I told -
LARRY
Wait! Wait!
The light window falls eye.
The screen white-out, emerges:
41 INT. JULIA'S FLASHBACK DAY
A bedroom, afternoon sunlight pouring

42 INT. TORTURE ROOM DAY
In extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks light
window, LARRY's voice downstairs
calls reverie.
LARRY
Slowly, you? Slowly!
Again, white-CUT, emerges:
43 INT. JULIA'S FLASHBACK DAY
The naked bed, sweating now.
Beneath them, wedding dress, crushed
weight.
Their love-making straight-forward:
element erotic perversity way FRANK
licks face, like animal, hold
tight loving. The sequence
escalates series strange details
locked bodies. Nails digging palms;
sweat rivulets running torsoes. And
faces. JULIA watching
FRANK, mesmerized amused intensity;
FRANK pained desire push
experience TO THE LIMIT. Their passion rendered
stranger way light window
falls bodies, making striped creatures them.
At last, urgency increases,
we're looking directly bed.
From JULIA's face see,
ecstasy moment seized her. Her arms
flung head; eyes closed
murmurs:
JULIA
Oh God. Oh God. Oh

The scene whites out.

right hand, attempts staunch
left hand.
JULIA
What done?
LARRY

Blood started drip, unnoticed them,
bare boards. Heavy splashes.
LARRY looks sick; face clammy sweat. She stares

cracks. Something begins wall ...
51 INT. DINING ROOM NIGHT
An explosion laughter. We
CUT TO
remains rack lamb, gravy congealed,
scraps meat adhering bone there.
This centre-piece table reduced
battlefield guests laughing off-screen.
We pass table, taking dirty plates
cutlery, napkins, glasses emptied wine bottles.
Finally, reach JULIA, sitting
table, retired comfortable
seats. She looks utterly miserable, little
drunk.
The room spruced party. Candles
burning tables mantelpiece,
pictures walls. But essentially
cosmetic. The place refurnished re-
decorated.
We party guests. Two, recognize:
KIRSTY, LARRY - presently entertaining
gathering account accident. The
new faces. An American couple: BILL
UNDERWOOD wife EVELYN, age
LARRY, younger, bespectacled man - work
colleague LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL. All drunk.
A brandy bottle sits table them,
half dozen liquer bottles besides. STEVE,
soon apparent, eyes KIRSTY.
LARRY half-way hospital story,
gesticulating wildly goes tale,
pleasure rest. His hand
lower arm heavily bandaged.
LARRY

EVELYN
Yes. You must. We're happy
you're back.
JULIA
(at door)
That's nice. Well ... goodnight.
She exits, chorus goodnights. KIRSTY
particular watches makes exit. JULIA's
behaviour confounds her. Meanwhile, conversation
returned LARRY's 'wound'.
EVELYN
Does hurt?
LARRY
Only I laugh.
This wins round laughter.
52 INT. LOWER LANDING NIGHT
JULIA walks landing, laughter - muted
distance - wafts below.
From floor above, hears more.

Its limbs, vestigial comparison, hang

From tail vast sting, oozing pus - like venom,

KIRSTY takes step her,

dropping her.
And then, miraculously, piece box slots
place.
The vortex seized CENOBITE seizes

The door slams them, accord.
KIRSTY turns sealed box hand.

She slams panel shut. The distortions cease. So
din.
KIRSTY

A smile crosses face, leaves doorstep,
making way street. STEVE gazes her,
follows.
Their figures erased darkness.
Somewhere, bell rings ...
