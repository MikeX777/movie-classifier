The Others there. They

There eighteen them, impossible distinguish

In kind.
The confrontation lasts minutes - display dies

EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES
Moonwatcher companions search berries, fruit

EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION
The tribe slowly wanders bare, flat country-
foraging roots occasional berries.
Eight irregularly strung open plain,
feet apart.
The ground flat miles around.
Suddenly, Moonwatcher aware lion, stalking
300 yards away.
Defenceless hide, scatter

INT EXT CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS
Over valley, moon rises, cold wind blows
distant mountains. It cold tonight -
cold, like hunger, matter real concern;
merely background life.
This Little Sun, shone night gave warmth,
dangerous; enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls cave, clambers large boulder

Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic survival rules

And caves, tortured spells fitful dozing
fearful waiting, gathered nightmares generations
come.

EXT THE STREAM - INVASION
The Others growing desperate; forage
valley exhausted. Perhaps realise
Moonwatcher's tribe lost numbers

meet river still, misty dawn,

usually harmless confrontation lasts seconds
invasion begins.
In uncertainly-moving horde, Others cross river,
shieking threats hunched attack. They led

Startled frightened, tribe retreats

As sees this, Moonwatcher's morale immediately
revives. He slows retreat, begins

With shrieks panic, Others retreat back,

The water's edge.
a12
EXT CAVE - NEW SOUND
Dozing fitfully weakened stuggle, Moonwatcher
startled sound.
He sits fetid darkness cave, straining
senses night, fear creeps slowly soul.
Never life - twice long members
species expect - heard sound like this. The
great cats approached silence, thing
betrayed rare slide earth, occasional
cracking twig. Yet continuing crunching noise
grows steadily louder. It enormous

A licks attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There nourishment here; like sensible hominid,

It soft, stops tracks,

The throbbing grows louder, insistent. Presently
hominids begin forward like sleep-walkers,

Then magic - magical

This little family male female children gorged

The family longer reposing peacefully outside cave;

A small wart-hog ambles past group browsing humanoids

But happy state affairs end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks heavy stone lying feet -
hurls unfortunate pig. The stone descends

And result, too, - warthog gives
amazed, indignant squeal, collapses motionless heap.
Then sequence begins again, time unfolds
incredible slowness. Every movement
followed; stone arches leisurely air,
pig crumples sinks ground. There scene
freezes long moments, slayer standing motionless
