car plunges bottom.
Cameron sits, immobilized realization betrayal
total. Everyone, Nina, conspired bring --
red light glowing, camera whirring, capture moment
death.
- 150 -
Outrage galvanizes action. He reaches door handles,
rip open -- snap hands. Now
rumbling rending metal roof begins implode,
crushing him. Under immense pressure, rear
window bursts inward, river rushing wild torrent. The
memory Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers window
slowly. The water pours faster. The level risen
chin. He gasps final breath water rises head.
Still red light burns. He reaches beneath seat
oxygen cylinder tries pull loose. It won't move. The
impact car hitting water bent seat frame. His
groping hand finds hose, oxygen mask. A hope. Though
second robbing chance life, movements water
slow motion. Pulling mask face, takes eager
breath chokes water fills mouth. The rubber tube
broken loose cylinder floating free --

it!" He feels blow back, another. They
gentle. Why cop smiling? Some walking away.
Where handcuffs? Why shaking hand instead? Then
jumble voices clearer..."No matter pay

cop dangerous -- guys terrific!" It finally sinks in,
insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization
