The camera swoops entrance, dives inside,
past couple tough-looking soldier ants stand
gates ant colony like insect bouncers...into access
tunnel snakes way that, past row ants
plodding along...
...and MAIN CHAMBER colony, huge, teeming
vista stretch away forever, filled ants
rushing business. We --

siblings, it's difficult
attention.
(pause)
I feel physically inadequate -- I've

The counsellor rolls chart wall. An arrow
shows ant population going up, up, up.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Ask we're successful.
Z

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

The motivational counsellor opens blinds...and

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR

Z
...Ants...
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Right! Ants! Millions creatures,

Down below, group ants carrying boulder
incline. One worker ants slips, boulder rolls down,
crushing leg. The ants rush -- looks like
they're going help fallen comrade, instead,
climb right him, pick boulder, continuing
task.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
You see? Being ant able
say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless,
you're meaningless."

Around base pedestal, crew workers loiters,
seemingly aimlessly...can unemployed ants
place?
GENERAL FORMICA
STAIRS!
The workers look GROAN. Then start forming
stairway bodies, linking arms, stepping
other's shoulders. It's extremely unpleasant work. One
ant little tardy, manages place
before...
GENERAL FORMICA, Pattonesque military leader
colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, step
ascends palace, aide-de-camp Carpenter tow. As
Formica mounts "stairs" hear workers going,
"OUCH! OOF! YIKES!" etc.

FORMICA
(Oliver North-style)

termites. The battle scene sprawling chaotic
Braveheart. In QUICK SHOTS Z's
perspective, see:
-- A squad ants rushes termite soldier,
literally melted smoking heaps flesh jet acid
forehead...
-- A termite warrior overwhelmed crowd ants
pulled pieces hideous ripping sounds...
-- Another termite warrior takes ant soldier
slowly crushes head huge jaws...
Z
(looking around)
Guys! Guys! It isn't late
talk over!
Just then, termite burst ground turns
face Z. Z dwarfed hulking, roaring, drooling
monstrosity.
Z
Wait! Please! Acid makes come

The termite rears, getting ready melt Z, OOF! he's

BARBATUS
Don't sappy it!
As Barbatus soldiers kill termite,
Colonel strides Z, puffing cigar.
COLONEL
I love smell formic acid
morning.
Z
Look out!
A stream termite acid engulfs colonel, instantly
burning cinder clutching still-burning cigar; Z's
paratroop buddies turn terror herd termites
rumbling them. Z, terrified, dives hole
huge termite made...
INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT
...and tumbles headlong corridor termite mound.
The corridors primitive, caveman-like, pocked
jagged access holes.
No sooner Z landed tunnel termite comes
burrowing walls, snapping Z's
head. Z avoids getting decapitated, digs straight
wall order escape...
INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
...straight hub entire termite complex --
Queen's chamber. This like civilized court
ant colony -- it's huge, stinking, fetid dungeon
walls held massive (to Z) column piled
stones.
The termite queen, repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long
monster, attended crew diminutive, blind termite
nurses. The queen turns look Z right eye.
Z
Excuse me. I lost, I
wondering --
Before Z say, "directions", queen gives
piercing, blood-curdling shriek. The nurses start shrieking
too.
Z
(backing away)
I'll let out.
But queen's shriek summoned soldier termite --
biggest we've seen -- charging headlong Z,
jaws snapping open shut like huge scissors.
Z
(backing away)
Shoo! -- Torro! Torro!
At moment, Z jumps way -- termite
runs headfirst supporting column chamber. As
spring release, termite's jaws clamp shut --
shatter base column. The walls room begin
rumble...
The termite turns eat Z...but crushed stone
falling ceiling, gives final shudder
collapses, raining earth stones queen.
As walls chamber crumble, melees ants
termites pour room corridors
above...they struggling until...
ANT OFFICER
(points Z)
He's killed Queen!
Z
Hey, I'm sorry, mistake --
ANT OFFICER
VICTORY!!!
We termite warriors, deprived
leader, suddenly confused directionless, easy prey
ants.
Z
(facetious)
This terrific! Let's exact
crippling war reparations! Let's set
puppet government!
ANT OFFICER
Let's slaughter all!
The ants set killing disoriented termites when...we
hear rumble coming outside...the ants look
confusedly...
...And (from ant's point view) five-hundred foot
long tongue bursts chamber
CRASH. The ants standing directly
smashed tongue, squirts spray saliva
crater. As quick appeared, tongue
retracts, hideous SLUUURPING sound. We
end snout ant-eater poking hole
ceiling high above...
ANT OFFICER
INCOMING!
The tongue comes again, smashing ants,
bodies slurped tongue...the ants scatter,
avail, tongue comes smashing
again...
Z heads corridor tongue smashes
again, barely missing him!
Z retreats corridor tongue searches him,
tunnel intersecting access-tunnels, getting
closer closer Z, dragging screaming ants
struggling termites...
....Then tongue disappears. Silence. Z wipes brow...
And hear thunderous SNIFFING noise anteater
searches prey... tongue starts rumbling
corridor right Z, tip squirming
ricochets walls!
Z gets runs, tongue lapping him,
reminiscent stone sphere nearly crushed Indiana
Jones Raiders Lost Ark! The walls disintegrate
pressure tongue, gets closer
Z...closer...
...and misses Z tumbles stump
ground...Z sits there, dazed, huge form
anteater withdraw tongue and, final
contented burp, shuffle distance.
EXT. TERMITE STUMP - MORNING
Z makes way corpse-strewn battlefield,
expression horror face.
BARBATUS (O.S.)
Z! Over here!
Z
(hopeful)
Barbatus?
Z looks feet, Barbatus's still-living,
decapitated head looking him.
Z
(shocked)
Barbatus!
BARBATUS
Be honest, kid -- I hurt bad?
Z
No, no, you're...lookin' good.
You've got good color cheeks.
BARBATUS
No -- I eyes. I'm
goner. It's alright, Z. In
ant's army, soldier's life ain't
worth sack fungus.
(he winces)
I can't feel legs...
Z
Hang there, buddy! You
it! Just -- deep breaths, I'll
try body -- it's gotta
somewhere!
BARBATUS
(gasping)
I wonder...what...was all...for...
Z
Barbatus, hang -- Barbatus!!
BARBATUS
Don't mistake, kid...
don't...be grunt...your
life...
Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.

Z Bala look around. Just things straight,
garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- seeing
human eyes. Instead, we're looking
ant eyes -- and, reimagined way, it's Paradise. Not
ordered, sterile, paradise picnic, earthly land
plenty.
The sides plastic garbage bags sheer, reflective
walls smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans gigantic,
metal columns gods (think
pyramids); coke bottle, refracting sunlight
gorgeous rainbow, trickles fountain sweet nectar
pink, bittersweet flesh grapefruit half,
appears multi-chambered concave dome. Everywhere,
insects disporting -- multi- species love-in
that's like insect version Woodstock.
Bala Z awe-struck. Bala turns Z.

WASP
It's them!
Suddenly, sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears
ridge, looking unlike ambushing Indians John Ford
film. Formica's soldiers stop tracks, awed
unfolding spectacle. It looks like Insectopia
turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles,
manner creatures crawling flying shown up,
surround army, dwarfing them.
WASP
Are hooligans giving
trouble, Z?
FLY
Say word, Z, kick
butts.
The ant army remains frozen, unsure next.
Formica furious. If ants veins, Formica's
bulging face.
FORMICA

Come on, yellow-bellies!
(turning Carpenter)
Don't stand there, Carpenter!
Make example yourself!
CARPENTER

Formica turns insects gathered him. With
chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward,
CHARGES Z!
FORMICA
AHHHHHHH!!
Formica runs quickly force helmet
blows head. Z's eyes big, stumbles backwards,
slipping, Formica goes flying him,
whirlpool behind. He scrabbles edge water,
tumbles over.
For moment, looks he's gone.
FORMICA (O.S.)
Help...help me...
Z goes edge precipice looks over. Formica
struggling waters flood created,
roiling far below. He looks Z's eyes,
new expression crossing features: fear.
FORMICA
Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...
Formica goes bit, head comes --
he's going able stay afloat long...
Suddenly sees line dropped down. Above, Z looks

Z

Formica looks line...and moment
realize error...
FORMICA

nearby spider, cavalry Insectopia).
Formica left, broken alone, precipice,
HORDES OF ANTS surround Z congratulate him. Bala fights
way embrace. Then
ants pick Z Bala, and, CHEERING, bear away.
Only Carpenter stays behind. He walks Formica,
carrying dented dusty helmet. He cleans best
jacket sleeve hands fallen

think you're completely worthless
individual.
FADE TO:

BALA

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY
Z Bala stand midst living room,
knees THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS. The children cover
horizontal surface. They run around, cry, laugh,
tease other. Z looks room, looks us,
