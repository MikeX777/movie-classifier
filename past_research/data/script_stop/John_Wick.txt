A verdant landscape rolling hills, lush countryside,
ambient peace.
EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY
A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: classic. Nearby,
small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled
setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned,
facade -especially roof- dire need overhaul.
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The hour hand old, electric clock shifts slightly,
marking a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath blankets,
body shifts, weathered hand reaching silence

staring unblinkingly day.
A beat... stands, donning weathered robe pair
slippers. John stuffs hands pockets...
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
...and shuffles corridor, walls overflowing
family pictures, badly need dusting. They
catalogue long healthy life wife, Norma;
pictures presenting time line sorts. No children,
sheer, unadulterated happiness.

Suddenly, phone wall RINGS.
John lowers cup, staring device, eyes tired.
A beat... stands, walking slowly answer it.

EXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY
A soft rain begins fall.
INT. THE HOSPITAL - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

room.
INT. THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS
John slowly approaches figure lying bed: surrounded
machinery, accompanied soft sounds technology.
He removes wilted daisies vase, tosses
trash, replaces fresh ones.
He pulls chair, reaches out, takes Norma's hand:
comatose, breathing synthetic...
machines... wires, tubes, monitors.
We face: silhouette.
He holds hand long moment heavy silence.
