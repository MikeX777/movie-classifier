THIS IS WHERE THE SOURCE BURNING SCENE WOULD COME BUT I AM
NOT WRITING IT FOR THIS VERSION.

down; (2) terribly late story; (3)
mean, here, hours movie, bringing
entirely new character; FBI agent's head
go, I think unnecessary confusing;
(4) important, I think characters abused
version--we added Sedam scene
berated version CREEP people
things turn. (5) Finally, reality
desperate, I let actors

time flick convolutions
it's bad manners reporter burn source, we've
got going point, I can't conceive
audience interested reporters
misbehaving.
However, scene requested time through, I shall
happy oblige.
