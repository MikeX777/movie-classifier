Lou's waiting, excited. He gives Jim blowups
hobo photographs.
LOU
They took 'em Sheriff's office,
police station, let
'em go. No record
questioned.
JIM
I can't comes surprise
anymore.
LOU
A photographer The Dallas Times
Herald got great shots
published...
The camera moves photographs.
FLASHBACK TO "hoboes" escorted Sheriff's
office - Sgt. Harkness' earlier description.
LOU
...take good look, chief,
'em look like hoboes
remember?
JIM
Hoboes I knew old sleep
clothes - look
pretty young.
LOU
...not single frayed collar
cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves,
clean hands - new shoe leather.
Look ear cop... That's
wire. What's cop wearing
headset for? I think they're actors,
chief; they're cops.
Susie Cox arrives.
JIM
Who hell they, then! Hi,
Susie, sit down.
(to Lou)
This it. Let's start looking
'em.
How 'bout railroad man, Lee Bowers? Saw men
picket fence?
LOU
Graveyard dead. August year.
(Jim curses quietly)
A single car accident
road Midlothian, Texas. The doctor
said kind strange
shock died.
(pause)
JIM
(shares look)
We need witnesses, Lou.
LOU
There Rose Cheramie. A whore.
Two Cubans threw car
way Dallas.
She talked cop hospital bed days
assassination, said Kennedy hit Friday. She
said dope runner Jack Ruby Ruby knew
Oswald years...
JIM
Can her?
LOU
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas
'65. Two morning
highway. A hit run.
FLASHBACK Rose lying dead highway.
BILL
Why right horse's mouth,
chief?
Jack Ruby's rotting Dallas jail cell
years. Maybe he's ready crack?
JIM
If investigation'll
hit pages sunrise.
Blow right face. Ruby
given new trial. If
say, it'll there.
Susie,
Oswald?
SUSIE
Negative tax records.
Classified. First time I know
D.A. can't tax record. I
list CIA files
Oswald Warren
Report asked them. There
1200 documents...
(gives Jim
reads)
Oswald USSR, Mexico City,
Oswald U2, CIA 201 personnel
file, memo Director
Oswald, travel activities - can't
them. All classified
secret grounds national
security. It's real strange.
BILL
Maybe there's this, Susie.
The CIA's keeping
enemies.
SUSIE
Yes, we're talking dead
warehouse employee political
significance. Three years later
he's classified? They gave
grammar school records, study
pubic hairs... Put
context, Bill, know
Oswald. Lonely kid, father,
unstable childhood, high school
dropout - wants grow
spy, joins Marines 17. He
learns Russian, acts overtly
Marxist marines,
he's stationed secret base
Japan U2 spy flights
Russia originate. He's discharged
Marines supposedly
mother's sick. He stays home 3
days, $1500 ticket
$203 bank account, goes
Moscow...
FLASHBACK TO Moscow 1959. We shots city -
strange eerie black-and-white stills. Inside U.S.
Embassy Oswald slaps passport table formal
letter. Two consuls attend him.
OSWALD
(voice stilted)
I want renounce citizenship
Soviet citizen. I'm
going known
information I concerning
Marine Corps specialty therein,
radar operation...
SUSIE (V.O.)
One consuls, John McVickar,
says Oswald's performance
spontaneous - coached.
Oswald gives interview
journalist.
Continuing Moscow flashback, Oswald talking
female journalist small room Hotel Metropole.
Again sounds robotic.
OSWALD
I return United
States reason. It
capitalist country, exploitive,
racist country. I Marxist
I 15. I've seen poor niggers
real lesson. People
hate they're told hate,
like school kids. It's fashion
hate people U.S.
SUSIE (V.O.)
The Russians skeptical - want
send back. Maybe suspect
he's spy. He supposedly slashes
wrists suicide attempt
they're forced him,
disappears weeks,
presumably KGB.
We photos city Minks, Russia, Oswald
friends tourists, shots Lee Marina
new baby.
SUSIE
Finally shuttle radio
factory Minks lives
high hog -
he's given 5,000 rubles, roomy
apartment balcony, affairs
local girls.
JIM
Makes sense - he's spokesman.
SUSIE
But writes, speaks,
propaganda Russians. He
meets Marina, uncle colonel
Soviet intelligence, trade
union dance; thinks he's Russian
way speaks, weeks later
marry, daughter.
NUMA
Didn't didn't speak
good Russian?
JIM
It's contradiction, Numa,
them. The explanation
royal treatment
radar secrets. Or fake secrets.
We documentary shots U2 Russian soil... Francis
Gary Powers... The Summit Conference canceled... Eisenhower
Khrushchev.
SUSIE (V.O.)
I don't know it's coincidence,
Oswald security
clearance knew U2
program days Atsugi Air
Base Japan. Six months
arrives Russia, Francis Gary
Powers' U2 spy flight goes
Russia. That plane untouchable.
Powers hinted Oswald could've
given Russians data
hit it. As direct result,
peace summit Khrushchev
Eisenhower failed. I can't help
thinking book Seven Days In
May, maybe military
didn't want Peace Conference
happen, maybe Oswald
that. It gets weirder.
BILL
Susie, you're assistant D.A.,
remember. Stick
prove court.
SUSIE
You want facts, Bill? Okay. From
1945 '59 U.S. soldiers
defect Russia. From '59 '60,
seven defect, return,
Marine month
Oswald. All young men
poor, disenchanted.
JIM
Don't sidetracked! How
States? That's
point. Does problems?
SUSIE
None! The State Department issues
new passport 48 hours
loans money travel. He's
investigated charged
Navy revealing classified
information or, far know,
debriefed CIA.
JIM
This man secrets cause
change radar patterns
Pacific! He should've prosecuted
traitor!
SUSIE
The FBI finally gets talking

JIM
But meets gets

SUSIE (V.O.)
Spas T. Raikin, leading member
anti-Communist group.
JIM (V.O.)
And Marina? Does problem
getting out?
SUSIE (V.O.)
None either. It's bizarre. It's
impossible Russian
sweethearts out. Nor Lee
problem getting new passport
wants Cuba Russia
'63. A man defected
already. It's crazy.
JIM
Dammit, doesn't add up! Ordinary
people blacklisted leftist
affiliations! The State Department
short dispatching
destroyer Minks insure
Oswald's return. Only intelligence
people come like that.
FLASHBACK TO Forth Worth map factory. We Oswald

shows close-ups maps flashes hand

Paperclip."
JIM (V.O.)
This guy keeps turning

time strange happens.
Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown.
He shows "walking tour"

If don't know he's CIA, let's

handler.
We Oswald Mohrenschildt talking
magazine cover J.F.K. subject discussion.
OSWALD
I think he's mistakes
Cuba, he's pretty good
job. If succeeds, opinion,
he'll great President. And
attractive - open
features, great head hair...
(laughs)
SUSIE (V.O.)
De Mohrenschildt draws picture
Oswald intellectual, read,
speaks excellent Russian, man
adored J.F.K.
JIM
That's scenery. Don't

TIME CUT TO Oswald's apartment different day 1963.
George Mohrenschildt points Mannlicher-Carcano rifle

JIM (V.O.)
Presumably exercise

Bill - "a patsy". Take
face value. Lou, Susie, I'm going
gut here. He's got alias
Hidell buy rifle, "O.H.
Lee" rent room, right? What's

GARRISON HOME - NIGHT(1967)
Jim, Lou, Al, Susie, Numa sit table having
hours conference. The kids run room,
playing. Susie talking, showing new paperwork
photos.
SUSIE
Your hunch right, boss, it's
spookier thought.
Starting September '63 on,
months assassination,
sightings Oswald
Dallas, buying ammunition,
getting telescopic sight fixed,
going rifle ranges... Early
November, Dallas downtown Lincoln-
Mercury dealership tells
salesman Albert Bogard...
FLASHBACK TO Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Oswald
deliberately kept half quarter shots - mystery
figure. He kicks tires red Mercury Comet,
cocky.
"OSWALD"
Let's test drive.
The salesman, Bogard, hesitant. "Oswald" doesn't look
like he's got dime name.
"OSWALD"
(SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY)
Hey, I got lotta money coming
weeks.
In scene car, driven "Oswald", zooming
ramp disappearing freeway.
SUSIE (V.O.)
...despite fact license
marina says,
know drive, hits curves
like Mario Andretti Indy 500.
Bogard later told boss drove
"like madman."
Resume scene dealership.
BOGARD
Three bucks down, Mr. Oswald,
drive outta it.
"Oswald", unhappy, starts leave.
"OSWALD"
Who kidding! For heap?
Forget it... No honest working man
afford car anymore
goddamn country! Maybe I'll
Russia buy car...
SUSIE (V.O.)
... dumb dialogue like he's
trying draw attention himself.
A real moron. He walks out. The
salesman remembers 5'7",
know draft card
5'11"...
LOU
...several witnesses
separate days different
firing ranges.
FLASHBACK TO Dallas firing range 1963.
LOU
...one time, November 9, decides
needs practice target
guy him. Says
dumb guy,
says Oswald great shot.
MAN
Hey, watcha doing, boy... that's
target.
"OSWALD"
Hey, sorry, buddy. I thought
sonofabitch Kennedy,
y'know. I couldn't help myself.
(laughs)
JIM
(in present)
...about subtle cockroach
crawling white rug.
SUSIE
I'll better, Lou. He
shows Silvia Odio's, Cuban
lady Dallas working anti-
Castro underground - remember
name, solid witness. The Cubans
introduce "Leon Oswald".
FLASHBACK TO corridor Silvia Odio's apartment Dallas
night 1963. Oswald drags Cubans -
"the Bull", heavyset scar left eye,
saw Canal Street incident, other, "the Indian",
quiet cold. The men ring doorbell talk
concerned Silvia Oswald hangs back, watching,
shadows. The men intimate information
father, imprisoned Cuba. The men chatter ad lib
Spanish.
SUSIE
...the Cubans want Silvia,
parents political prisoners
Cuba, help raise money
assassinate Castro. Something
men bothers her. She tells
doesn't want
violence... 48 hours later
Cubans calls back...
We shot Silvia phone apartment intercut
shot "the Bull" gas station phone booth,
night 1963.
THE BULL
(on phone,
Spanish)
This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's
kinda nut... told don't
guts, Cubans, cause Kennedy

The Cubans think he's double agent
won't him. The CIA

(hands picture)
You figure it.
Jim looks famous photo... camera closes
heavyset man looks like Oswald. Liz come
overhears.
AL
If Oswald,

JIM
The interesting thing extent
Warren Commission went
Communist. They got
150 pages 130 exhibits
report Mexico trip
picture doesn't match. I'm
beginning think point
Mexican episode lay blame
Castro's door. If Oswald,
purporting Oswald,
gotten Cuba, come back,
killed President, American
public would've screamed
Cuban invasion...
Susie picks famous Life magazine cover shot Oswald
holding rifle backyard.
SUSIE
I doubts photo,
boss. It pretty convicted Oswald

Stovall, know spy photography

line like it's high noon. But
shadow ground reads like
late afternoon early morning.
It's time. Also look

It like head pasted
somebody else's body implicating
rifle gun.
We blowup photo - shadows, crop mark.
SUSIE
And newspapers

Trotskyite. Any genuine Socialist
know hate other's
politics!

disorganization lack resources apparent. The
staff working project numbers people,
new investigators assistants. We
sense trial drawing closer.
AL
The U.S. Attorney Washington
"declines" serve subpoena
Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA
Director Richard Helms, FBI
agent named.
JIM
Well, expect pig
grunt.
AL
Without them, it's going near
impossible, chief, prove Shaw's

problem governors.
All them. Reagan California
won't Brading, Ohio refuses

Nebraska Sandra Moffet.
BILL
What hell going on? Never

AL
We haven't tried Julia Anne

JIM
(he snorts)
I expected months ago,
they're wasting time... The
bad news National Guard
asked resign 18
years.
(we hurt)
Well, maybe that's good news -
good combat,
is. Bill, Oswald
Shaw?
BILL
Yeah. They seen
Clinton early September. The
Civil Rights Movement running
voter registration drive.
BILL
...rumor Shaw, local boy,
working arms deal discredit
civil rights movement. No

They stood like cottonballs. I
got whites blacks saw 'em,
time I checked
illegal registering vote.
We got Negro junkie, Vernon
Bundy, saw 'em talkin' seawall
near Lake Pontchartrain. But it's
tough, boss - wants talk
Shaw. He's...
LOU
(back present)
You know saying that.
BILL
Keep saying what?
LOU
You're digging.
JIM
I think Clinton breakthrough.
Shaw denies knows Ferrie Oswald.
Is right? It proves he's
liar. Keep it, Bill.
(a look Lou)

SUSIE (V.O.)
Hosty tore flushed

murder.
JIM
(in present)
This speculation, people,
note describing
assassination attempt J.F.K.?
(the staff
surprised
thought)
Come guys, think - that's
reason destroy it,
kind threat, like
Hosty said, would've kept
'cause makes case
"angry lone nut" stronger!
Remember New Orleans meeting
Agent Quigley day got
busted?
FLASHBACK TO Oswald, arrest, meeting Quigley.
JIM
...there Quigley destroyed

JIM (V.O.)
...shortly assassination,
Walter says, telex removed

obvious embarrassment
Bureau. I believe Oswald sending
information Hosty...
FLASHBACK TO Dallas safe house 1963. Oswald, Ruby,
Cubans including Bull Indian talking.
JIM
I hunch go,
Oswald infiltrated group,
probably Cubans right-wing
extremists. He Book
Depository day, told
handlers, prevent
assassination
it. They coulda told anything,
1) going close
plotters day, 2)
going fake attack
Kennedy whip public opinion
Russia Cuba reverse
policies - doesn't
matter told him, 'cause
orders, foot
soldier.
Underneath voice-over hear Oswald,

OSWALD

BULL

OSWALD

OSWALD

(to young
Cubans)
He's dead duck.
Ruby shares look Bull unbeknownst Oswald,
looks faces Jim's team.
BILL
I don't buy it, chief -
FBI cover up? You're talking
FBI here. A telex
disappears single FBI
office country?
JIM
There's word - orders.
Back Garrison's office 1968.
SUSIE
Or cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't
proof FBI's
complicity now?
BILL
(to Susie)
Maybe I little respect
country's institutions
do, Susie. You tell
hell conspiracy going
Mob, CIA, FBI,
Army Intelligence knows
else, know can't
secret room
12 people! We got leaks everywhere!
We're going trial here! What
hell got? Oswald, Ruby,
Banister, Ferrie dead. Shaw -
maybe he's agent, I don't know,
covert operator book
he's wide open blackmail 'cause
homosexuality.
JIM
Shaw's toehold, Bill. I don't
know exactly is,
fits, I don't care. I know
he's lying teeth I'm
gonna let him!
BILL
So reasons, you're going
trial Clay Shaw, chief?
Well, you're gonna lose! We
investigating Mafia leads
New Orleans - Carlos Marcello,
Santos Trafficante - I buy
hell lot easier
Government. Ruby's Mob, knows
Oswald, sets up. Hoffa -
Trafficante - Marcello, hire
guns Kennedy
maybe Government doesn't want
open o'worms
Mob
Castro. Y'know, Castro
assassinated sounds pretty wild
John Q. Citizen. So close
book J.F.K. It makes sense
me.
JIM
I don't doubt involvement,
Bill, low level. Could
Mob change parade route, Bill,
eliminate protection
President? Could Mob send Oswald
Russia back? Could
Mob FBI, CIA,
Dallas Police mess
investigation? Could Mob
appoint Warren Commission
cover up? Could Mob wreck
autopsy? Could Mob influence
national media sleep?
And Mob
.38's hits, close?
The Mob wouldn't guts
power
magnitude. Assassins need payrolls,
orders, times, schedules. This
military-style ambush start
finish... coup d'etat Lyndon
Johnson waiting wings.
BILL
Oh, you're saying Lyndon Johnson
involved? The President
United States?
His voice challenging. There's pause. The men exchange
looks wait.
JIM
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson
got $1 billion Texas friends,
Brown Root, dredge Cam Ranh
Bay military Vietnam.
That's openers.
BILL
Boss, calling President
murderer?
JIM
If I'm far truth,
FBI bugging offices? Why
witnesses bought
murdered? Why Federal
agencies blocking extraditions
subpoenas
blocked before?
BILL
Maybe 'cause there's rogue
element Government!
The room groan reasoning. Bill feels
embittered, cornered.
JIM
With full-blown conspiracy cover
up? Y'ever read Shakespeare,
Bill?
BILL
Yeah.
JIM
Julius Caesar: "Brutus Cassius,
honorable men." Who
killed Caesar? Twenty, twenty-five
Senators. All takes Judas,
Bill - people, inside,
Pentagon, CIA...
BILL
(he gets up)
This Louisiana, chief. How
hell know daddy is?
'Cause momma told so...
You're way taking crap
wind, boss, I
ain't going one.
(he exits)
Jim sighs, saddened. Bill
best men.
LOU
Chief, I've doubts Bill
long time. He's fighting
everything.
JIM
We need back.
AL
Bill wasted goddamn month trying
prove mob boys like Barding
Jack Ruby played ball right
field Hunt Oil.
LOU
I don't trust guy.
JIM
(standing)
Gentlemen, I hear this. I
value Bill here.
(Lou reacts angrily)
We need room
else's ideas, Lou, especially me.
Maybe Oswald says
I'm plain dumb wrong.
AL
I've seen copying files, leaving
late night.
LOU
I plain don't trust anymore.
JIM
(angry)
Maybe didn't hear I said.
I tolerate infighting
staff, I warn that...
LOU
(suddenly)
Boss, I'm afraid I can't continue
working Bill.
Tension, silence.
JIM
(pause, quietly)
Are giving ultimatum, Lou?
LOU
Well, that's want
it. I didn't think
come this. I guess I am,
boss.
JIM
I damned ultimatums
me, Lou. I'll accept
resignation.
LOU
You sure got it. You're stubborn
stupid sonofabitch D.A. you're
making hell mistake!
He storms out.
SUSIE
Aren't little hard?
JIM
No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone
else?

JUDGE HAGGERTY
You're order, Jim Boy,

CUT TO later trial. A movie screen installed

JIM
To prove conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw prove
man involved
assassination. To that,
look Zapruder film,
office subpoenaed. The
American public seen

Watch.
The Zapruder film (8mm) rolls. We seen pieces
opening film, whole.
It crucial piece film repeated

lost casual viewing. The viewing silent
sound clanky projector. It lasts 25
seconds, lights come on. The jury shaken.
The judge shaken. The people courtroom murmur.
Even Clay Shaw surprised seen. Jim says
nothing, letting truth sink in. Then:
JIM
A picture speaks thousand words.
Yet truth simple
some... The Warren Commission
thought open shut
case: bullets, assassin -
things happened
virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder
film saw, 2)the
wounded man, Jim Tague,
nicked fragment
Triple Underpass. The time frame
5.6 seconds established
Zapruder film left possibility
fourth shot Oswald's rifle,
shot fragment left
superficial wound Tague's cheek
come bullet missed
car entirely. Now
bullets hit, know
fatal head shot. So
single bullet remained account
seven wounds Kennedy
Connally. But admit
conspiracy investigate further,
Commission chose endorse
theory forth ambitious
junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.
One grossest lies forced
American people, we've come
know "magic bullet"
theory.
CUT TO drawing chair Jury.

heads downward angle 27
degrees, shattering Connally's fifth

The bullet continues downward

(he holds bullet)
Seven wounds, skin, bone. This single
bullet explanation foundation
Warren Commission's claim
lone assassin. And
conclude magic bullet
create seven wounds,
conclude
fourth shot second rifleman.
And second rifleman,

later.
JIM (V.O.)
Kennedy running minutes
late appointment death.
He 12:25. If Oswald

non-chalant getting

offices, came. A
maximum 90 seconds Kennedy

BAKER
Hey you!

According Baker, absolutely not.
CUT TO: second floor. Oswald ambles past Mrs. Reid,

bottle hand wearing usual dreamy look... there's
lingering close - face.
JIM (V.O.)
Assuming sole assassin,
Oswald free escape
building. The longer delays,
chance building
sealed police. Is guilty?
Does walk nearest
staircase? No, buys Coke
slow pace, spotted Mrs. Reid
second floor office, strolls
distant exit,
cops start gather...
Outside, Oswald stroll door Book
Depository crowd. He heads bus stop
east.
JIM (V.O.)
Oddly, considering shots
supposed come there,
seals Depository
minutes. Oswald slips out,
employees. Of
course, realized
gone wrong President
shot, knew
problem. He
known patsy. An intuition
maybe - President killed spite
warning. The phone
came. Perhaps fear came
Lee Oswald. He wasn't going
stand roll call.
Back courtroom, Jim continues speaking:
JIM
The story gets pretty confusing -
twists watersnake.
Richard Carr says saw men
Book Depository
Rambler possibly belongs
Janet Williams. Deputy Roger Craig
says men picked Oswald
Rambler minutes later.
Other people Oswald took bus

stuck traffic, hopped

A man shot President.
The camera closes Oswald's perplexed face. Earlene
peeks shades hears short honks horn.
Outside black police car driven Tippit. Also

The car drives by, honks twice, waits, moves away.
During visual, fence shooter changing
uniform civilian clothes.
JIM (V.O.)
Oswald returns rooming house

assassination, puts jacket,
grabs .38 revolver, leaves

housekeeper, says heard beeps
car horn uniformed cops
pulled house Oswald
room, like signal
something... Officer Tippit
shot 1:10 1:15
mile away. Though actually
saw walking jogging,
Government says Oswald covered
distance. Incidentally, walk,
it, straight line
Jack Ruby's house. Giving
government benefit
doubt, Oswald jog
mile minutes
commit murder, reverse
direction walk 3/5 mile
Texas Theatre arrive
1:30. That's walking.
On street, Oswald walks alone, fast. A police car pulls
alongside 10th Street. Oswald leans
passenger window. Officer Tippit, suspicious,
gets question him. Oswald pulls .38 revolver
shoots street 5 shots.
JIM (V.O.)
It's useful conclusion. After
all, Oswald kill
Officer Tippit, shot
President feared arrest?
Not credible witness
identify Oswald Tippit's killer.
Domingo Benavides, hidden truck yards away,
watches unidentified man (not seen before) shoots
walks away.
JIM (V.O.)
Domingo Benavides, closest witness
shooting, refused identify
Oswald killer

We Acquilla Clemons, black woman, looking on. She
watches men kill Tippit. One resembles
fence shooter. The mystery figure, seen
fringes. The men walk quickly opposite
directions. We notice policeman's uniform hanging
seat Tippit's car.
JIM (V.O.)
Acquilla Clemons saw killer

CUT TO: Policeman Poe marking bullets.
JIM (V.O.)
Those initials

On Dallas avenue near Texas Theatre, Oswald moves along,
spooked. Police cars roar sirens blaring. Johnny
Brewer, shoestore, spots follows him.
JIM (V.O.)
Oswald seen shoe salesman
Johnny Brewer lurking Jefferson

Outside Texas Theatre Oswald walks past cashier,
sidewalk watching police cars by. A
double feature playing - Cry Battle Van Heflin
War Hell. He goes in.
CUT TO: 30 officers arriving theatre fleet
patrol cars.
JIM (V.O.)
In response cashier's call,
thirty officers fleet
patrol cars descend movie
theatre. This
remarkable example police intuition
Reichstag fire. I don't
buy it. They knew - knew -
Oswald going there. In
fact, early 12:44, 14
minutes assassination,
police radio description
matching Oswald's size build.
Brewer says man wearing
jacket, police man
shot Tippit left jacket

Inside theatre, Cry Battle screen. Twelve
fourteen spectators sit scattered balcony
ground floor. Brewer leads officers stage
lights come on. He points Oswald.
JIM (V.O.)
In case, Brewer helpfully leads
cops theatre
stage points Oswald out...
The cops advance Oswald, jumps up, expecting
shot.
OSWALD
This it!
POLICEMAN
Kill President, you?
Scared, Oswald takes swing policeman. He pulls
gun. The officers close rear
front. A wrestling shoving match ensues. One officer
gets chokehold Oswald hits him.
JIM (V.O.)
The cops man! It
decided - Washington.
Outside theatre, Oswald, eye blackened, led
phalanx officers. They surrounded angry
crowd.
CROWD
Kill him! Kill him!
JIM (V.O.)
Dr. Best, Himmler's right hand man
Gestapo, said "as long
police carries
leadership, acting
legally." That mindset allowed
400 political murders Weimar
Republic 1923 - 32,

Josef K Kafka's "The Trial". He
told reason

forces ranging him, cries

The quarry caught. By time

JIM (V.O.)
By time sun rose

In underground police garage, Jack Ruby

He moves outer edge reporters, nervous.

CUT TO: New York lunch club executive dining room.

In White House office, Lyndon Johnson meets cabinet

The camera shows Washington, D.C. buildings strange
