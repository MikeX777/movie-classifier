FLOATING IN TOWARD A LONG DINING TABLE
In trailer. The table laid Thanksgiving
dinner, huge turkey sitting far end.
Cut-out letters end room say: "WELCOME
HOME KIDS!"
The grandchildren running frame taking
seats table, accompanied parents.
VOICE OVER
...But me'n Ed, good too...
The elderly couple enter camera
stand foreground, backs us, facing table.
VOICE OVER
...And real. It
like us. And like well...
home... If Arizona,
land, far away,
parents strong wise
capable, children happy
beloved... I dunno, maybe
Utah.
The elderly man drapes arm wife's shoulder
draws close. She rests head shoulder,
we:
FADE OUT
THE END
