MR. PICKLES
Yeah... happy `n tidy.
Shoe sticks head barrel, covered dust.
SHOE

MR. TROUT
Like end story,
lives story.
Shoe climbs barrel. He pulls Lord Portley-Rind's
white hat trash. It filthy torn. Shoe
frowns it, tears frilly ribbon top, tosses
rest trash.
MR. PICKLES (O.S.)
Not sure we'd next, though.
Shoe looks defensively, grunts quietly, scampers
center Market Square. We follow dark
jumps open manhole.

MR. PICKLES
Ya think universe,

MR. TROUT
A tiny little speck!
MR. PICKLES
And giants looking

MR. TROUT
And time move...
MR. PICKLES

MR. TROUT
