He hits end slides. The wall fills white

Something FALLS end desk.
Reed raises head, revealing flattened face. He steps

He LUNGES Sue, STREETCHING ARMS AROUND SHELF,
pushing Sue away, INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND!
Reed Sue hit floor. A close call. Now
closeness: Sue Reed lay face-to-face, Reed's wrapped

SUE
Sorry. My fault. I won't...touch

His face tightens, pained. We hear faint SQUEAK
skin.

Reed turns head around, seeing JOHNNY come hall.
JOHNNY

He grabs bar-rag dry off.
ALICIA
I don't think She's real big hate.
BEN
You wouldn't that,

She knocks drink, grabs cane, steps Ben.
