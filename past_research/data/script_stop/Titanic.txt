MOANING darknes them.
ROSE
It's getting quiet.
JACK
Just minutes. It'll boats

Rose unmoving, staring space. She knows truth. There won't
boats. Behind Jack sees Officer Wilde stopped moving.
He slumped lifejacket, looking asleep. He died

steerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera.
Then, white lifebelts bobbing darkness like signoposts,
bodies come torch's beam. The people dead
drowned, killed freezing water. Some look like

IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE Jack Rose floating black water.
The stars reflect pond surface,
floating interstellar space. They absolutely still. Their hands
locked together. Rose staring upwards canopy stars wheeling
her. The music transparent, floating... long sleep steals
Rose, feels peace.
CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like faces dead. She
floating void. Rose semi-hallucinatory state. She knows
dying. Her lips barely sings scrap Jack's song:
ROSE
"Come Josephine flying machine..."
ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've seen them. The Milky Way
glorious band horizon horizon.
A SHOOTING STAR flares... line light heavens.
TIGHT ON ROSE again. We hair dusted frost crystals.
Her breathing shallow, motionless. Her eyes track
stars water.
ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter boat crossing stars.
She sees men it, rowing slowly oars lift syrupy water,
leaving weightless pearls floating air. The VOICES men sound
slow DISTORTED.
Then lookout flashes torch light flares
water, silouetting bobbing corpses between. It flicks past
motionless form moves on. The boat 50 feet away, moving past
her. The men look away.
Rose lifts head turn Jack. We hair frozen

ROSE
Oh, Jack.
All hope, spirit leave her. She looks boat. It

She closes eyes. She weak, reason
try.
And then... eyes snap open.
She raises head suddenly, cracking ice rips hair
wood. She calls out, voice weak don't hear her. The boat
invisible now, torch light star impossibly far away. She struggles
draw breath, calling again.
292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears him. He points
ahead, turning tiller.
293 ROSE struggles move. Her hand, realizes, actually frozen
Jack's. She breaths it, melting ice little, gently unclasps
hands, breaking away tinkling film.

IN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only face visile, white
moon. The man jumps up, pointing yelling. Soon
looking shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV silent,
SLOW MOTION.
IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE Lowe light green flare wave
shouts cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats human
emotion.
DISSOLVE TO:

Several police mob back. The dock packes friends
reletives, officials, ambulances, press--
Reporters photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep foot
gangways, lining tops cars trucks... 1912 equicalent
media circus. They jostle close survivors, tugging
