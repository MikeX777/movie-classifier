SCROLL OVER BLACK:
Antarctica. Six million square miles ice. The
coldest place earth.
Forty-six countries competing claims maintain
outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds claims
check.
There regular law enforcement. A single U.S.
Marshal assigned territory.
END SCROLL
EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAY
Snow-covered hills thrust barren, white
wasteland. No buildings, animals... nothing.
CLOSER: The hills defined. Rows jagged
peaks crazed pattern crevasses. A fine `mist'
wind-blown snow whips jumble glinting
ice.
STILL CLOSER: We track valleys, skirt
crevasses, climb peaks finally pause flat
stretch ice. HOLD scene timeless, savage
beauty, then...
THUD!!!
A FACE, hooded goggled ECW (extreme cold weather
gear) drops frame, smashing icy surface
brutal impact, shattered goggle shield pops
--
-- EYES STARE BLANKLY camera -- locked death.
It's man.
Camera slowly starts PULL BACK limbs
snapped unnatural angles, head grotesquely twisted
-- bright red arterial blood seeps corpse
spreads tiny cracks ice until,
startling speed, turns dark freezes.
We PULL BACK look body, bizarre
shape spider's web frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
PULL BACK... further...until dazzling
