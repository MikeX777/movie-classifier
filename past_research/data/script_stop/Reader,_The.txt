trials couple years ago.
That's long gap. What's
reason gap?
ROHL waits moment STUDENT answer.
DIETER
I'd thought obvious.
ROHL
Say.
DIETER
Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't
it? It's bad conscience. It's
big cover-up.
ROHL
Go on.
DIETER
After war. The German people
didn't want look they'd
done.
ROHL
Is right?
DIETER
Because hide.
All parents liars. All

called law. You're guilty
merely working
Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked
Auschwitz. Precisely 19
convicted, 6 murder.
To prove murder prove
intent. That's law. Remember,
question `Was
wrong?' `Was legal?' And
laws, no, laws

But isn't that...
