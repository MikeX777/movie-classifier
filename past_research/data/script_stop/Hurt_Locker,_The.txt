CUT TO:
EXT STREET/DAWN
A grainy, low-resolution view, seen sixteen inches
street level. And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast.
From angle close ground FLY road strewn
war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit --
which, odd, jarring perspective, looks
gigantic, monstrous.
We zoom crumpled COKE CAN, white `C' growing
enormous screen, filling screen like skyscraper.
We SMASH barrel ahead.
A RAG flutters, blocks view, tumbles away, --
-- zoom downhill, gray sand, zoom
hill off, catching air, flash horizon line,
BRIGHT SUN, land hard packed road.
We close particular pile trash, topped
white plastic garbage bag, stop. Puffs dust
fluttering plastic.
We glide fluttering plastic. Flies buzzing.
Advancing slowly, inch inch, edge

A RUSTY ARTILLERY SHELL.

THE U.S. MILITARY HAS CONTROL OF THE CITY, BUT INSURGENT
GROUPS ARE MOUNTING FRESH ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT
THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS ON 31 JANUARY 2005.
THEY'VE ADOPTED A DEADLY NEW TACTIC, USING I.E.D.s -
IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES - TO AMBUSH AMERICAN TROOPS. THE
BODY COUNT IS RISING.
IN RESPONSE, THE ARMY HAS DEPLOYED THE LAST OF ITS ELITE BOMB
SQUAD UNITS, HOPING THAT THESE THREE MAN TEAMS CAN DISARM THE
BOMBS BEFORE THEY EXPLODE, AND STEM THE TIDE OF DESTRUCTION.

Man. Because weight complexity takes men
- Sanborn.
Sanborn kneels guides Thompson's feet

secure armor, like squire working knight.
A strap near crotch prompts Thompson wisecrack:
THOMPSON
Watch it.
SANBORN
(SMILING)
I thought

THOMPSON

Thompson twists chest protector on. Eyes tight,
brow furrowed, squints far distance. That's going

THOMPSON
Okay. I'm going
