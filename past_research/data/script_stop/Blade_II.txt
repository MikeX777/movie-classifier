VERLAINE

Reinhardt tenses, thrusting stake forward -- Blade
whirled way, trapping hand,
violently twisting backwards.
Before Reinhardt knows what's happening, Blade swings
headlock. In free hand he's got
tiny, barbed flechette. The barbs spring open like tick's

Blade tightens grip, choking Reinhardt's air.

Then reaches clip ammo vest. But hands

away Asad, looks Whistler.
CHUPA
Listen, hillbilly, cunt-hair
away cowboy heaven.
WHISTLER
Ain't thing chicken wing,
buttercup.
BLADE
(still suspicious)
Where you, Whistler?
WHISTLER
I'll you.
INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS
Whistler, Blade surviving members Bloodpack
gathered octagonal iron culvert
beneath ballroom. Whistler turns flashlight. We
HEAR moving darkness. The group tenses,
Whistler's flashlight beam reveals --
A REAPER
Cowering culvert. One recognize. The
vampire guard bloodbank, transformed. He's
shrunken emaciated, pale. And he's obviously
dying, HISSES, fanged mouth snapping
ineffectually them. His arm trapped -- pinned
sectional culvert coverings. It looks like
he's trying gnaw order escape.
REINHARDT
What hell?
WHISTLER
I like this. I think
trying crawl culvert.
Blade looks culvert question. He pulls
sectioned covers. The opening feet wide,
large man gain access.
INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - CONTINUOUS
Blade drops sewer line. The area claustrophobic,
damp. There torn pieces insulation hanging
ceiling, saturated dripping blood.
Blade crouch-walks in. We hear WIND. He shines
FLASHLIGHT. A portion brick wall looks like it's
clawed open.
NYSSA
(calling down)
Everything okay?
Blade retreats drain-pipe, pulling
up. We HOLD beat, drift blood-saturated
strips insulation. SOMEONE crouched shadows
there, clinging ceiling upside down.
It's NOMAK, red-eyes shining darkness.
CUT TO:
INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - BATHHOUSE - DAY
We previously unseen portion Damaskino's vast
bedroom. An elegantly tiled pool area partitioned
series latticed screens. In counterpoint
series muted monitors tuned pulse
world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc.
Damaskinos sits robe, finishing meal, eyes
flicking monitors -- tracking current events, market
fluctuations. We sense man true
polymath. That owes thousand-plus years
existence resourcefulness luck.
Stevens enters, waiting acknowledged.
DAMASKINOS
(vampire dialect; subtitled)
Yes?
STEVENS
(vampire dialect; subtitled)
They've contact Reapers.
DAMASKINOS
(vampire dialect; subtitled)
Any casualties?
STEVENS
(vampire dialect; subtitled)
Two far.
Unconcerned, Damaskinos slices piece raw meat.
DAMASKINOS
(reverting English)
An inevitability, I suppose. Nyssa
them, I trust.
STEVENS
No. This dangerous game, you're
playing, Damaskinos.
DAMASKINOS
Any game worthy played is. One
patient. In way, I
outlived enemies. All them.
Damaskinos steps screens now, pool area --
can't water angle,
patterns ruby light flickering tiled walls.
Stevens follows, uncomfortable.
STEVENS
Blade's volatile. You're going
able manipulating --
Damaskinos steps steaming liquid,
BLOOD. His robe spreads out, floating surface.
DAMASKINOS
You worry much, Stevens. I
assurance friend inside
events unfolding scripted.
STEVENS
As scripted? You've lost
own. How willing
sacrifice?
Damaskinos sinks he's waist-deep crimson fluid.
DAMASKINOS
As takes.
(pointing)
Do jar there?
Stevens looks shelf gold crystal Coptic jar
rests. A HUMAN HEART floats within.
DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)
It contains human heart --
(touching pale scar
chest)
Something I relinquished long time
ago. Only fool appeal
now.
CUT TO:
INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT
The dying Reaper chained inside cell. It
WHEEZES MOANS, clearly agony. Blade Nyssa stand
watch. Blade grips Reaper beneath jaw, turning
face us.
BLADE
Recognize him?
NYSSA
(nodding)
From surveillance footage
bloodbank. He guard's
Nomak attacked.
BLADE
Which means turned seventy-two
hours ago.
NYSSA
Right. So dying? He doesn't
appear broken bones,
entry wounds kind -- what's
killing him?
BLADE
Time.
Blade nicks Reaper's carotid artery knife. CLEAR
SERUM oozes out, red blood cells all.
BLADE (CONT'D)
No hemoglobin left.
Their metabolisms fast. They
burn out. That's they're having
feed often. Their systems self
destructing.
NYSSA
If that's true, Nomak? He's
alive longer others.
BLADE
Nomak's different. He's carrier.
(shaking head)
There's driving
Thirst. Something we're missing.
As watch, Reaper shakes final death
throes, grows still, nictomembranes eyes
slowly sliding down.
MOMENTS LATER - A SERIES OF ISOLATED CLOSE-UPS
A pair GLOVED HANDS spreads apart Reaper's eyelids.
In response, protective nictomembrane slides mechanically
pupil.
NYSSA (O.S.)
They appear nictating membrane
here, like you'd crocodile
camel. Shields eyes sunlight.
The hands Reaper's mouth, probing seam
chin, splitting mandible apart reveal
enlarged esophagus. The fingers push gums
pressure-sensitive fangs extend response.
NYSSA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
A bifurcated mandible. More developed
masseter muscles zygomatic bones
mouth allowing
larger, stronger bite --
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Blade, Nyssa, Scud gathered autopsy table.
The rest crew linger back.
NYSSA (CONT'D)
Epidermal layers thicker, tougher --
Nyssa begins Y-incision chest. Once again,
CLEAR SERUM oozes out. She cracks open thoracic cavity.
SCUD
Ho-lee shit.
We SEE inside abdominal cavity. A complex, pinkish/gray
parasitic organism taken organ visible.
NYSSA
I've seen like this. The
Reapers different
you.
(probing organism)
It's virus re-wiring
bodies, creating new, parasitic
organs consume old ones.
BLADE
Like cancer purpose.
NYSSA
Exactly. Look digestive system.
It's drastically simplified. Super
charged. And --
She pulls lungs -- calcified structure encasing
fibrous mass rests heart normally be. She
taps calcified structure scalpel.
NYSSA (CONT'D)
The heart completely encased bone.
She tries cut bony shell scalpel snaps.
Scud WHISTLES, impressed.
SCUD
Good luck getting stake that.
Blade studies Reaper corpse, looks Bloodpack.
BLADE
We've got hours till sunrise. Be
ready then.
ASAD
What happens sunrise?
BLADE
We hunt again.
CHUPA
You gotta fucking joking.
BLADE
You've seen we're against.
Daylight's advantage we've got.
They'll vulnerable then.
REINHARDT

REINHARDT
(snarling)
Spare race card, OJ. We're

BLADE
You don't choice. You're

Blade spins leaves. Whistler follows. Nyssa watches
disappear Blade's room. Reinhardt
vampires approach her.
REINHARDT
You buying chocolate Elvis
bullshit?
Nyssa stares down, obviously conflicted.
CHUPA
This guy doesn't know fuck he's
doing. We lost Priest
Lighthammer, who's gonna next? Fuck
him. Fuck rules. First chance I
get, I'm chowing fucking
HeeHaw sidekick his.
Snowman signs Verlaine.
VERLAINE
What think, Asad?
ASAD
(pointedly)
I don't think. I follow orders.
Asad looks Nyssa -- he's concerned
now. She's staring direction Blade left.
INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
Blade sits shadows, wrapping piece rubber tubing
arm, injecting pneumatic syringe
serum. He shivers, convulses violently, throws
head relief. When so, SEES --
Whistler standing doorway. They eye
moment Blade unwraps tubing arm, puts away
syringe serum. Whistler lights cigarette,
nods window Nyssa others.
WHISTLER
You ask me, Miss Muffet

BLADE
I wouldn't worry it.
Blade moves walk away, Whistler stops him.
WHISTLER
I worrying. Seems me, you're
starting confused

BLADE
Pretty hollow words coming man

WHISTLER
What hell supposed mean?
BLADE
It means I'm starting wonder
vampires hooks you.
You've acting strange I
gave cure. Reckless, quick
anger --
(beat)
You said yourself, Whistler. Those
vampires knew defense
backwards forwards. Where'd
intel?
Whistler steps closer, voice dropping lethal,
whisper.
WHISTLER
I'm compromised?! Me?! I'm
playing stink-finger Vampirella
there!
Blade stares Whistler, calm viper.
BLADE
You're line, old man.
The comrades arms stare down. Then,
finally, Whistler backs away.
WHISTLER
(quietly)
We'll see.
Whistler turns strides exits. We HOLD ON Blade, torn,
conflicted, watching Whistler retreat.
EXT. BLADE'S WAREHOUSE/SHIPYARD - NIGHT
We SEE FIGURE emerge shadows -- CHUPA.
EXT. CITY SLUM - NIGHT
Chupa walks night, scanning shadows.
CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)
Like heat-vision, tinged crimson. There DRUG
DEALERS feeding WHORES trolling tricks
here, BEATING HEARTS BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted
ghostly silhouettes.
Chupa moves mouth alley, nodding DEALER.
DEALER
Lookin' hooked up?
CHUPA
What got?
As dealer glances anyone's watching --
DEALER
Horse, Hawaiian ice. Whatever want.
Chupa sniffs air, glancing pulsating vein
dealer's neck, smiles.
CHUPA
Whatever, huh? Well I'm
hook bitch.
Chupa steps alley dealer.
DEALER
So what's gonna be?
CHUPA
Fear.
Chupa dealer's throat finish,
flashing fangs, shoving backwards. Then --
CHUPA (CONT'D)
I like little adrenaline chaser.
WHAP! A HAND
Grabs fistful Chupa's hair, jerking head back. It's
Blade. He yanks Chupa dealer.
BLADE
What think you're doing?
CHUPA
Trying feed, puto baboso!
The dealer takes Blade swings Chupa around. They
exchange couple blows, Blade knees
balls, twisting arm, dislocating it.
Blade releases Chupa, shoving forward. Chupa's broken
arm dangles awkwardly. Furious, Chupa reaches .45
good hand -- hear CLICK gun
it's placed head.
ANGLE ON NYSSA
Standing him, looking grim determined.
NYSSA
Do die.
(Chupa considers options)
You heard Asad. Until over,
people allies.
CHUPA
Oh I haven't forgotten Asad. I'm
wondering have.
Chupa re-holsters gun, jams dislocated arm
wall resets it. He backs away. Nyssa
watches leave, looks Blade.
NYSSA
He's right thing. We
survive.
BLADE
You don't hunt it.
NYSSA
Really? What supposed do,
then? Starve fee
order live? What
scumbag let hook?
A nothing. A drug-dealer. How
justify saving people like that?
Blade doesn't answer, moves away. She follows.
NYSSA (CONT'D)
You know Thirst better

state pain, having shoot

surviving, Blade.
Off Blade's stony expression --
CUT TO:
INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Scud triggers modified entry light. The light PULSES

Mmm-mmm. Poppa's got brand new bag.

Blade picks UV lasers. He sights

SCUD
The powerpacks limited charge,

Nyssa gestures flashbang grenades.
NYSSA
What these?
SCUD

Asad looks Blade.
ASAD

BLADE
We won't need to. They'll come us.
REINHARDT
How?
Blade looks Nyssa, tosses Reinhardt aerosol
cannister. He sprays little, wrinkles nose

REINHARDT (CONT'D)
This fucking foul!
NYSSA
They're pheromones. I infused
Reaper's adrenal glands. All

CHUPA
Fuck that! I'm spraying gash

NYSSA
Trust me, Reapers key it.
If use this, we'll draw out.

A steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE. He
stoops waist-deep water, picking thinks

bluff overlooking ocean. A moment later, Whistler
emerges light, watching Blade sets Nysa

THE HORIZON
faintest glimmer pre-dawn light brightens
cloud-swept sky. It's peaceful. We hear SURF
crashing shore below.
Together wait.
A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges earth's curvature,
spreading dazzling radiance skyline.
Nyssa's eyes widen expectation, breath catching. She
looks Blade, stroking face, smiling.
NYSSA

Blade nods, he's strong her. Despite best efforts,
tear slides cheek. They kiss sun rises
glory, flooding world brilliance.
Blade holds Nyssa tightly chest, refusing
relinquish grip body catches fire. The end
blessedly quick -- slow-burn blazing agony,
nearly seamless transition life --
To ash... Nyssa collapses apart Blade's arms, billowing
cloud glowing embers. One moment
she's there, she's gone. Blade remains is,
kneeling bluff, wind carrying traces
Nyssa aloft sky. He shuts eyes. Turns face
warmth sun, surrendering acceptance.
WE RISE UP
isolating Blade windswept bluff. After
moment, Whistler moves Blade's side. He rests hand
Blade's shoulder, doesn't word. We moving

DISSOLVE TO:

As Blade inspects sword, hear earlier words again:

Satisfied work, Blade smiles --
