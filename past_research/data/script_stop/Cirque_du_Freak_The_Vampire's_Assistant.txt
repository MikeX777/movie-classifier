trumpets silent.
Then, dull green light glows stage. Before

Knocked heap.
Debbie moves Murlough behind. She's going
fighting well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
pretty powerful himself.
Murlough pulls Darren feet, stands up. He swings
fist vicious arc.
Darren ducks Murlough's fist SMASHES right
wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
Murlough's getting tired Darren.
MURLOUGH

But attempts pull arm through, can't.
He frowns. Then eyes widen pain.
Murlough jerks arm hard can. The wall
smashes open Murlough brings arm

The audience remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
react debris falls above, smashes stage.
UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
Crepsley brings knife.
Murlough catches wrist hand.
With grips Crepsley throat, SLAMS
hard I-beam pillar. Again. Then squeezes. We
hear cartilage crunching Crepsley's throat.

As people start exits, Mr. Tiny'is them.
UPPER FLOOR
But Darren stands, it's over. Steve grabs Debbie,
pushes edge rafters are.
STEVE

I mean it!
It sounds like does. Darren looks intently Debbie.
She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
Understanding, Debbie tears away. To precipice.
But instead falling, continues rafter.
Steve slides her. But reaches her,
deftly skips rafters, jumps floor.
Before Steve follow, Darren cuts off. Below them:
rows jagged, rusty pipes. The remains pumping
station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting impale.
DARREN
It's over, Steve.
STEVE
Is it?
Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
having rafters. A missed footfall
last. They separate, try gain position.
STEVE
You wanna hear funny?

They continue circling.
STEVE
And fine. They acted
like barely remembered you.
DARREN

Darren lunges, Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren

Darren flings Steve way. To safety.
DARREN

Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed like this. Darren
starts rafter him. One look hate.
STEVE
