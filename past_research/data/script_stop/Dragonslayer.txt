SHOOTING DRAFT
FADE IN:
CASTLE - NIGHT
Now comes moon riding horizon. Upon hill
edge wood squats castle, crude stonework
bathed cold silvery light. Queer carvings runes
decorate ponderous gate. Heavy vines climbing
walls. The castle old, unfamiliar form testament
ancient mind ancient craft. Flickering candle light
dances leaded windowpane.
Inside, corridors dark silent. Under low arched
ceilings uneven floors paved stone blocks.
Perched lintels crouched niches icons
strange animal heads.
HODGE
A sleep straw palette room strewn vegetables
crockery Hodge, wrinkled old retainer. A flickering
candle jug bed. He snoring gently.
CONJURING ROOM
This circular chamber heart castle stuffed
parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass
retorts, chemical salts, birds stuffed caged. An
iron candelabra stands work table, tapers burning. In
soft glow room unoccupied, no,
moving background shadowy figure, preparing
magical deed. Feet positioned carefully
pentagram chiseled floor. A scroll consulted;
comes arm voice blurts out:
VOICE
Omnia duos: Duo Unum: Unus
Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia
nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.
Nothing happens.
VOICE
Come on, candles, out!
But little flames stand attention
tremble.
VOICE
In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi:
Lux! Exstinguat!
It's use. There sigh figure moves forward
light. Revealed glow discouraged face
Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.
TOWER
Carrying candelabra, youth trudges circular
staircase.
TURRET
The highest point castle turret, open
stars night air. Here, magic afoot. An old
enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water
silver ewer stone bowl. As surface ripples
disappear leans forward gazes pool. All
face hardens distant sounds screams
thunder reach ears. Lights shadows, reflected
basin, play face. His frown deepens
sound voice comes vision
water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched
roar flame ugly snarl.
At moment Galen reaches steps holds
candelabra.
GALEN
Vide, Magister. There's
wrong.
Ulrich, startled trance, slaps water
basin turns confront student. Galen taken aback
old man's grim countenance.
GALEN
What's matter? What's happened?
ULRICH
I've seen something. Something
consequence you.
GALEN
To me?
ULRICH
(calm)
Yes. My death.
With distracted gesture causes flames extinguish
themselves.
ULRICH
Perhaps better hasten
training.
CUT TO:
BARNYARD - DAY
Outside castle wall Hodge feeding chickens
ducks. He straightens squints early morning
mists. On distant hillock figures moving
woods.
ULRICH AND GALEN
Hobbling slowly aid pair canes, Ulrich guides
pupil wooden bridge stream
forest.
ULRICH
(stern troubled)
This wood, leaves, birds,
dome heaven,
rang great chord:
philosophers like kept
tune. Now, new voices singing
new songs.
(sharply)
Have mastered threefold
transmutation?
GALEN
Of course.
ULRICH
(skeptical)
You have?
GALEN
Well, almost.
ULRICH
It's difficult. Have
committed memory undying Codex
Profundis?
GALEN
(a shrug)
The chapters.
ULRICH
It's long. And Ritual
Banishment prescribed
late master Balisarius?
GALEN
To tell truth, I haven't dared
try it. What's point, anyway?
ULRICH
The point? The point don't
know it, you're magician
it. It hope school
you, mold faculties
wits... I believe
talent. Somewhere.
GALEN
I hate books. I hate drill. I want
real task.
ULRICH
There's time now. When I'm gone,
half powers universe
vanish me. And what's use
lingering skills they're
left hands child?
(pause)
Listen!
GALEN
I don't hear anything.
Ulrich gauges young man standing makes
decision. Reaching cloak lifts fine silver
chain amulet dangling it. He drapes
Galen's neck.
ULRICH
Here, wear this.
Galen instinctively wraps hand jewel. He cocks
ear.
GALEN
Voices, singing road.
He hastens forward promontory, eager look.
Ulrich follow. Instead, doffing cloak, whirls
him, magically floats feet
ground. Awkwardly, old man clambers aboard.
GALEN
I don't anything.
He turns back, wizard gone. A shadow falls
him. He looks up. There, feet tree
tops master soaring wind.
AIRBORNE
The old conjurer squints distance. Miles away
far company drab walkers winds margins
forest. They singing mournful round.
GALEN
He gawks skyward. Suddenly, old man leans
addresses him.
ULRICH
(a shout)
We visitors!
CUT TO:
ROTUNDA - NIGHT

contingent weary peasants, awkward amidst dusty
rugs, drapes heavy furniture. Their leader fineboned

CONJURING ROOM
Galen helps Ulrich prepare audience. The sorcerer
peers full-length mirror, adjusting hem
black robe.
ULRICH
Looks forbidding enough, don't
think?
GALEN
Here sticks.
ULRICH
No -- they'll think infirm. You
know, Balisarius wore
changed lead gold. He
that, know. I
could. Too bad -- you'd stand
inherit real wealth.
GALEN
You're morbid frame mind.
What's dying? You
don't look sick.
ULRICH
(tying sash)
You wearing amulet?
(Galen nods)
Good. Don't lose it. It belongs
me.
He backs away mirror fits silver coronet
head.
ULRICH
Now, adeptus minor,
handful sulphurous ash
there...
The sorcerer starts circular stone staircase.
THE ROTUNDA
The visitors watch warily door swings open Galen
makes entrance, face expressionless hands pressed
together. He looks young famous Ulrich.
Galen allows moment by, throws arms wide.
Ka-whump! Ulrich appears doorway smoky
fireball. Alarmed, visitors retreat.
ULRICH
Nunc habeus lux!
Pffst! room candles flare niches.
ULRICH
Et calor!
In fireplace, birch logs suddenly ablaze. Ulrich
totters hearth extends long bony fingers
warmth.
ULRICH
Welcome Cragganmore. I Ulrich.
Which calls
Valerian?
The travelers suitably dazzled magician's
performance. The young leader party screws
courage speaks.
VALERIAN

ULRICH
I know you're here. You're
delegation Urland,
Dalvatia. Let's artifacts.
The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions
companions. The man steps forward hands
leather pouch. One one, Valerian places contents
table Ulrich's inspection.
VALERIAN
A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
blackened.
(pause)
Scales.
At this, Ulrich advances closely examines shimmering
irridescent disks big saucers.
ULRICH
All right. How come these?
VALERIAN
(proudly)
I them. At mouth

ULRICH
(grim)

Valerian reaches jerkin withdraws appears
curved sword. He jabs table.
VALERIAN
A claw.
ULRICH
That's claw. It's tooth. By
gods!
He runs finger serrated edge gazes bleakly
visitors.
ULRICH
And want battle

Valerian lost trace timidity.
VALERIAN
Who turn to? We know

basilicok.
(he takes step
forward)
A cockatrice.
(another step, bolder)
A dragon.
(he leans close
Ulrich)
This stag, bear, natural
creature. This kind.
And necromancer
rid it.
ULRICH
Did try Meredydd sisters?
What Rinbod? I've heard
said killed dragon once.
VALERIAN
They're dead. You're
left.
With sigh, Ulrich lowers chair. He rubs
withered legs shakes head.
ULRICH
It's long way Urland.
VALERIAN
Every quarter, solstices
equinoxes there's new
victim.
Greil, grizzled peasant, speaks up.
GREIL
My daughter, one.
OTHER TRAVELERS
My sister... cousins...
ULRICH
All women?
VALERIAN
Girls. Virgins, exact, chosen
lot.
Galen edges table inspects scales
tooth.
GALEN
Master, don't think --
ULRICH
Silence!
He broods long time.
VALERIAN
Are afraid dragons?
ULRICH
No. Sorcerers dragons
long long time together. If weren't
sorcerers, wouldn't
dragons.
(pause)
All right. I'll go.
CUT TO:
COURTYARD - DAY
The travelers making ready departure grey
light dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions wicker box,
Ulrich wraps padding newly fashioned pair crutches.
ULRICH
I know dragon. Vermithrax
Pejorative: she's years

I'm finish off,
don't think?
(he tries
crutches)
There. Flatten highest mountain.
What you, Galen?
(no answer)
Speak up.
(still answer)
You, Hodge.
Hodge mutters inaudible grimly keeps packing.
ULRICH
(to Galen)
While I'm gone
nose books hands

instruments too.
Galen crouches castle wall; regards master
sullenly.
GALEN
Look yourself. How far
like that? A league, leagues?
ULRICH
I'm worried road.
GALEN
(sarcastic)
Why don't wave hands
summon coach-and-four?
ULRICH
Don't mock me.
Galen gets calls Urlanders.
GALEN
You pilgrims: You're
lotteries. Why draw straws
who'll carry
ironshanks here.
This Hodge.
HODGE
Hold tongue. If master's
got mind go, he'll go.
Galen approaches old sorcerer.
GALEN
Send me. You're saying I need
seasoning. I need test. Let go.
ULRICH
You're ready.
GALEN
I'm ready anything.
ULRICH
(wan smile)
Don't hasty. Your time
come.
The walkers ready set forth. Hodge picks pack,
steps forward pulls open great gate.
HORSEMEN
Three mounted men outside gate, helmets
heads, swords belts longbows
shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders step
backward.
VALERIAN
Tyrian!?
Tyrian lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There coat
arms shield strapped pommel saddle.
TYRIAN
(amiable)
Good morning, all.
VALERIAN
We're afraid you. Give
road.
TYRIAN
Why, road yours. All way
Urland. It's long journey, isn't
it? But you're search
sorcerer, I suppose distance
great.
Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches
arm.
ULRICH
(under breath)
Say nothing.
Galen hears urgency old man's voice obeys.
Hodge takes deal strangers.
HODGE
What want us?
TYRIAN
Well, like good friends here,
I've come bit black magic.
No doubt you've heard troubles
home. This Cragganmore,

HODGE
Aye, place Ulrich.
Tyrian dismounts saunters old magician.
TYRIAN
And mystical presence

HODGE
You'd best distance --
manners.
TYRIAN
If he's ready lay dragon
grave, he's got fear

(turns Urlanders)
I've love creature
lot. Nor King. But,
stir things up, don't
think good idea you've
got right man job?
HODGE
Aha -- it's test you're looking
for. We don't tests.
TYRIAN
I'm sure don't. They
tests -- real deeds
either. Oh, conversation
grandmother's shade darkened
room, odd love potion two...
comes doubter, then, it's
wrong day, planets
aligned, entrails aren't
favorable, don't tests.
VALERIAN
We've got doubts. We require
test.
HODGE
And you're going one.
When Ulrich finally speaks, voice low
authoritative.
ULRICH
(to Galen)
Go conjuring room. The iron
box. Fetch dagger within.
Galen's eyes widen alarm.
ULRICH
The dagger. Be quick.
Galen dashes castle. Ulrich gazes shyly
Tyrian.
ULRICH
You shall test.
CONJURING ROOM
Galen comes puffing steps, locates iron box,
flings open. Amidst tawdry paraphernalia
professional magician ivory-handled dagger covered
runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines
blade twist aside collapse handle,
genuine. A murder weapon.
ULRICH'S VOICE
(impatient)
Where you, boy? I'm waiting.
Galen throws open window looks courtyard.
He displays dagger.
GALEN
Not one, it?
ULRICH
The one. Let fall.
Galen hesitates, tosses it. Tumbling end end,
arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches hand
plucks neatly air. Galen watches Ulrich
passes weapon Tyrian strips robe exposing
bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes
door. He's step away bangs shut
accord. He sprints second exit. Whack! This door slams
shut too. Locked in. Quick, window climb
vine... Smack! heavy shutters seal in.
ULRICH AND TYRIAN
Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm guides point dagger
breastbone.
ULRICH
Vita regula, vita hieratica!
Everyone filled dread. Hodge shaking. From
castle come rattling shutters Galen's muffled
cries. A sick sarcastic smile crept Tyrian's lips.
He tenses thrust.
ULRICH
Go on. Don't worry, can't hurt
me.
CONJURING ROOM
Galen stops hammering presses face crack
shutter. Below participants grisly
drama. He holds breath. Tyrian makes sudden movement
buries blade Ulrich's chest. But sorcerer
stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, long moment,
slowly sags forward dagger hand
holds it. Tyrian shrinks allows body fall
heap. Very quickly remounts. In moment
companions gone. The riveted horror.
Hodge sinks knees wails grief.
Galen turns away window gazes blankly
gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch
swing open.
CUT TO:
FUNERAL PYRE - DAY
Ulrich, principal magician sorcerer western world,
reposes hardwood pyre. His hands folded chest.
His face peaceful. While visitors wordlessly look on,
Galen touches burning brand kindling. At
catches normally enough, flames start
envelop body suddenly turn pale green, producing
unearthly roar. The onlookers away intense
heat.
GALEN
The erstwhile apprentice stands ground, blinking
tears, face weirdly illuminated fire.
CUT TO:
CONJURING ROOM - DAY
Galen sits amidst museum-like collection magical
apparatus. He stares amulet, considering
significance. His reverie interrupted murmur
voices below. At window looks Hodge bidding
farewell delegation Urland. Valerian
leave. He pauses gate glances Galen.
Then moves on. The young student magic sets jaw,
suddenly filled resolve.
Moving room, busies old man's
effects. He scoops loose books parchments
locks trunks. He drapes muslin cloths
alchemical devices. He sows handful salt
pentagram inscribed floor. Finally, opens cages
releases crow, falcon, great horned owl.
COURTYARD
Hodge burned funeral pyre, anxiously scraping
ashes small bones leather pouch -- remains
Ulrich. Up comes Galen, clad traveler's
cloak, pack staff hand.
GALEN
Hodge -- doing?
Hodge quickly conceals pouch.
HODGE
Just making farewell, thank
much.
He quickly climbs down, picks pack follows Galen
gate. As door pushed shut huge oaken
timber falls place, barring castle
uninvited.
CUT TO:
HILLTOP - DAY
Galen Hodge labor crest grassy hill turn
look wide valley. There hilltop
far sits Cragganmore, lit red rays
setting sun. Galen removes amulet neck
clutches fist. Hodge bug-eyed it.
HODGE
Be careful that! You don't know
you're doing.
GALEN
Stand back!
He raises hands castle calls out:
GALEN
Cragganmore! Domus non am! Silva
celet!
CRAGGANMORE
The vines castle walls begin twitch stretch,
magically brought animate life. They flow upward
masonry, branching covering surface,
roof. Finally tops chimneys
highest turrets stand green carpet. A century's
growth matter seconds.
GALEN HODGE
On hilltop old retainer gives youth fearful
look. Galen flushed excitement
notice.
DISSOLVE:
FOREST PATH - DAY
Galen Hodge trudge overgrown cart-track
arch trees.
HODGE
Oh, it's vale tears
dwell. It doesn't matter

rags, time comes,
magic save you...
GALEN
I guess...
The apprentice's mind elsewhere: he's got coin hovering
mid-air palm, bobbing gently walks.
HODGE
...the kindest lord man ask
for... he's gone. Ye gods

(snurfling)
Up I was, mucking

(through tears)
I'm going miss him.
GALEN
Me too...
He plucks low-hanging leaf, waves hand it,
watches turn spray daffodils.
HODGE
No don't. All care
tricks knavery. Well,
don't pull wool old
eyes. It'll mighty long walk
shoes, mark
word.
GALEN
What's matter, Hodge, pack
heavy? Here.
He gives pack slap. It flies harness
floats alongside them. Hodge snatches clutches
tightly.
HODGE
Careful that!
GALEN
Too cold, it?
A great coat drapes Hodge's shoulders.
HODGE
Stop it!
GALEN
Too warm?
The greatcoat disappears, rest garments,
leaving smalls.
HODGE
(spluttering)
Stop it, I say! Out respect
master!
Suppressing grin, Galen mercifully waves hand
restores Hodge usual costume.
GALEN
I've got respect
master anyone, old man. But --
again, I'm master now.
CUT TO:
TRAVELERS' CAMP - NIGHT
The Urlanders gathered fire, sharing meager
supper. The man named Greil pokes stew-pot.
GREIL
I left farm seeds unplanted,
calves unborn, wife
chase strays, what?
A funeral, that's what.
He walks Valerian.
GREIL
Because people said,
magician. Not local fellow,
import, good leagues
home. An all-powerful necromancer.
Ha -- necromancer!
Malkin, older man, speaks up.
MALKIN
Hold tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat.
GREIL
I'll sit. I'll eat. See
Great Bear. His tail points east.
It's equinox. Have forgotten?
Or think it?
VALERIAN
(miserable)
He's right. I brought
nothing. May gods help whoever's
daughter tonight.
There noise darkness campfire. Two
men feet listen. At silence,
rustling. Without word men dart
bushes haul interlopers company: Galen
Hodge.
HODGE
Good morrow, good morrow. Peace
you.
GALEN
Easy now. We mean harm. We've
looking you.
GREIL
(growl)
Well, you've us.
GALEN
(brushing off)
More way around, I'd say.
VALERIAN
What want?
GALEN
A words, that's all. You
looking conjurer.
VALERIAN
He's dead.
GALEN
Right. Requiscat pace.
(he takes deep breath)
Ecce: magister novus!
GREIL
How you?
Galen surveys puzzled faces. He draws
plunges in:
GALEN
My lord Ulrich longer. All
asked him,
expect me. The dangers
face, I conquer. The task
undertake I fulfill.
I Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor
Ulrich's craft knowledge, I
Sorcerer seek.
There moment depressed silence. Hodge rolls eyes.
Greil starts chuckle, laugh. Soon
laughing too.
GREIL
Well, that's handsome thought, O
wizard wizards. But there's
thing friend Tyrian shown
us, it's beware pig
poke. Who's got dagger?
HODGE
No tests!!
GREIL
Call proof, then.
Someone brings dagger hands Greil. Valerian
pushes away.
VALERIAN
We've seen tests.
But Greil persists, waving knife group.
GREIL
Well I haven't. All I've seen
death. Death families, death
road, tonight, death
home.
He lashes knife. Galen jumps back, Valerian
steps in, delivering quick kick Greil's gut, followed
right jaw sends bigger man sprawling.
He takes knife.
VALERIAN
What's come you, anyway? Have
lost wits?
He propels Galen harm's way sits

GREIL
I don't like it. Young snot-nose
comes sport
expense. We're fool's errand,
don't listen this.
I don't want hear

spells.
Valerian hands Galen plate food.
VALERIAN
You hungry.
GALEN
(nods)
What's matter him?
VALERIAN
It's him. It's us.
It's equinox.
They look moon.
CUT TO:
DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT
The moon shines far reaches Kingdom
Urland, coldly lighting barren landscape filled
skeletons dead trees, blackened rock bare ground.
Advancing mournful terrain troop armed
men leading blindfolded horse tumbril. The horse
skittish. Finally, spite shouts lashings, refuses
further. The leader, Horsrik, barks order:
HORSRIK
Close enough! Bring out!
A young woman, seventeen, brought forth
cart. Long black hair falls white tunic. Her
dark eyes dart fearfully pale face. She
half-carried, half dragged edge steaming crack
ground manacled wooden post. By
lantern-light, Horsrik reads parchment scroll.
HORSRIK
Now known

lawfully chosen deed

There low rumble; earth shakes. Horsrik glances
nervously around. He carries rote.
HORSRIK

gratitude sacrifice His
Majesty declared family --
what's name? --
He prods girl, terrified speak. Beneath
them, earth groan. Smoke issues mouth

RETAINER
Plowman! The family Plowman!
HORSRIK
(rushing it)
-- family Plowman free

The horse suddenly rears, blindfold notwithstanding,
gallops off, dragging tumbril rocks. The men

HORSRIK

reigning king realm...
seal, mark, duly read
Chancellor Horsrik holy name.
Now Horsrik joins flight, chasing men
murky horizon.
THE GIRL
She strains manacles, cocking head listen
rumblings subside. Presently steam smoke
blow away horse pawing stamping
yards distant, wheel cart jammed
rocks. Summoning wild live, squeezes
hands cold iron rings. No use. She spits
wrists twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips
free. She looks horse. The animal tosses
blindfold looks her. Now strains
pulls hand free. She wipes blood frock
sprints horse. But doesn't there. The
earth abruptly shifts feet, tumbling
cracked steaming rocks. When raises head huge
shadow fallen horse. There piteous whinny,
roar. The girl's face suddenly lit flames. She
scrambles feet rushes way.
THE CHASE
The girl hasn't taken dozen steps huge
hurtles forward blocks way. Something scaly
glittering. She whirls stumbles new direction.
This time she's cut monstrous claw tipped rapier-
like talons. She screams crawls away. Another claw
prevents escape.
THE CREATURE
Membranous wings fold night sky. Up comes
silhouette reptilian head swaying serpentine
neck. There's angry hiss. A sheet flame envelops
everything.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
FOREST - DAY
Tyrian kneels mountain waterfall, having drink
men hover background. One points
slope.
MAN
There. I them.
Tyrian wipes mouth unhurriedly strolls look.
Far below, half hidden trees, little company
Urlanders winds way forest.
A frown creeps Tyrian's face.
TYRIAN
Who's old man?
MAN
Where? Which one?
TYRIAN
That one. That's man
Cragganmore. Now what's
here?
MAN
Filling chief, I reckon.
TYRIAN
(weary)
What pity.
CUT TO:
HODGE
Hodge marches rest. When he's sure
looking burrows garments brings
leather pouch containing Ulrich's ashes. Reassured
it's him, tucks away again. Galen falls
step.
GALEN
What got there?
HODGE
None business.
GALEN
A little gold, eh? What I
change lead?
HODGE
Save jokes else.
Me, I don't care braggarts.
They pass Valerian, dropped line.
HODGE
And I don't care frauds.
GALEN
I'm fraud.
HODGE
Call fool then. Upstart. Whatever
pleases you.
GALEN
Hodge, forced come
along.
HODGE
Oh, I'm free will,
right. We master's
bidding way.
GALEN
Well, told I needed
wetnursing, don't turn
home.
Hodge snorts fusses pack.
HODGE
Home, it? You've seen that,
haven't you? Gone seed, I'd say...
He glances discovers Galen missing.
GALEN
He walks trail, looking Valerian. Pretty
soon rest travelers sight. He hears
sound splash. He turns trail pushes
shrubbery.
FOREST POOL
Under oaks hickory, forest stream widened
quiet pool. A pile clothes lies rock edge.
Out middle, Valerian treading water.
GALEN
You're far us. Come
out.
VALERIAN
You ahead, I'll catch up.
GALEN
Not good idea separated.
Let's go.
VALERIAN
Right. I'll along.
Galen leans splashes water face. Feels
good. He shucks pack starts throw clothes.
Valerian doesn't like it.
VALERIAN
That's right. Don't come in.
But Galen naked walking water. He swims
Valerian.
VALERIAN
(edgy)
You better group,
they're probably worried.
Galen keeps swimming.
VALERIAN
I prefer swim alone, don't
mind.
But Galen slipped beneath surface; doesn't hear.
UNDERWATER
Galen works way murky green underwater world.
Suddenly, stops short stares. He's feet
Valerian's dangling legs. He gasps surprise. Valerian
boy.
ON THE SURFACE
Galen comes shooting surface, coughing sputtering.
GALEN
By gods!
Valerian pale frightened.
VALERIAN
Stay away.
She propels backward, turns swims shore.
ON THE SHORE
Galen Valerian taken refuge separate bushes.
Briskly pull clothes.
VALERIAN
I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go
ahead, I don't care. It's relief.
GALEN
I'm going anything.
VALERIAN
I don't blame you. I stupid.
Careless. A silly woman!
GALEN
(feeble bluff)
Take easy. I knew moment I
saw you. I've known time.
VALERIAN
You knew thing. No knew.
Not I born. Go on, run
tell them. It'll great
story.
GALEN
Don't worry. No one's going
out. Just tell me: why?
VALERIAN
Ask father.
They finish dressing silence. Finally:
GALEN
The lottery! Daughters chosen,
sons not!
VALERIAN
That's right. Unless plenty
gold property.
GALEN
What mean?
VALERIAN
If you're rich enough,
goes in.
(bitter)
My father poor. So lot
fathers.
He studies her. She jams hat head and,
young man, stalks off.
THE VISION
Galen walks edge pool retrieve
pack. As leans catches sight appears
reflection water: Tyrian horseback. He whips
around, him. Riveted vision,
hurries bank follow it. After paces
blurry figure dismounts, unslings longbow, nocks arrow
draws string taut.
GALEN
(horrified)
No!
FOREST
Galen sprints trees. Up ahead Valerian, walking
resolutely.
GALEN
No!
She glances grimly keeps walking. Galen
shoots past forest.
GALEN
Hodge!
TRAVELERS
Galen races trail rounds bend sees Urlanders
coming him. Hodge precedes group unsteady
gait. He sees Galen, raises arms flops face
trail. A long arrow protrudes back. Galen
kneels him. The uneasy company keeps distance.
Hodge struggles speak.
HODGE
Galen? Can hear me?
GALEN
I hear you.
HODGE
You know, somebody shot me, I
talk. There's
done.
GALEN
I know.
HODGE
Not cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes.
Here.
Hodge's hand comes coat gripping
leather pouch. Galen tugs it, Hodge can't let go.
HODGE
Take it. Sorry, you'll peel
loose.
Galen pries sack Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly
hand comes up, grabs Galen hair, pulls
near.
HODGE
(a croak)
...burning water... lake,

scuttle away. Galen pauses mop brow; it's getting
hot. A sound echoes depths, grinding sound
like gnashing teeth, followed hissing squealing.
Galen grips sword tighter pushes on. Suddenly

grinding sounds louder. He hurries forward rounds
corner. He stops gags.
BASILISKS
Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons --
perched corpse Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding
contentiously choice bits royal flesh. Galen groans:
lashes sword beheads tiny monsters.

DEATH
Now Galen understands. He seizes granite block

flash shatters million fragments.
Far blinding flash Ulrich's earthly
body explodes belly beast. The darkened
sky lights huge gouts flame spew forth
dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, reptilian
torch plummets ground.

water. There stupendous splash eruption steam.
GALEN VALERIAN
They stare lofty perch, watching

THE CARCASS - DAY
Grey misty light reveals beast's mangled remains. Galen
Valerian emerge fog, walk blackened

Below, yoked oxen drag heavy carrion away sledges. In
background workmen dump remains open

THE KING
With crack whip clatter hooves, royal
coach pulls shore lake. A door creaks open
King Casiodorus totters out. His face puffy, eyes
red. He slogs mud head dragon
