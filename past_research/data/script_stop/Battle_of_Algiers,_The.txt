1ST JOURNALIST
Colonel Mathieu ... spokesman
residing minister, Mr. Gorlin, stated
"Larbi Ben M'Hidi committed suicide
cell, hanging
pieces shirt,
rope, attached
bars cell window." In preceding
statement, spokesman
specified that: "... intention
expressed prisoner Ben
M'Hidi escape opportunity,
necessary hands
feet bound continually." In
opinion, colonel, conditions,
man capable tearing shirt,
making rope it, attaching
bar window hang himself?
MATHIEU
You address question
minister's spokesman. I'm
statements ... On part, I
I opportunity
admire moral strength, intelligence,
unwavering idealism demonstrated
Ben M'Hidi. For reasons,
remembering danger represented, I
hesitate pay homage
memory.
2ND JOURNALIST
Colonel Mathieu ... Much said
lately successes
obtained paratroopers,
methods employed ...
Can tell this?
MATHIEU
The successes obtained results
methods. One presupposes
vice versa.
3RD JOURNALIST
Excuse me, colonel. I impression
excessive prudence ...

allusive questions,
respond allusive manner. I think
better things
right names; means torture,
torture.
MATHIEU
I understand. What's question?
3RD JOURNALIST
The questions asked. I
like precise answers,
that's ...
MATHIEU
Let's try precise then. The word
"torture" appear orders.
We spoken interrogation
valid method police
operation directed unknown
enemies. As NLF, request
members, event
capture, maintain silence
twenty-four hours, then,
talk. Thus, organization
time necessary render useless
information furnished ... What type
interrogation choose? ...
courts use crime
homicide drags months?
3RD JOURNALIST
The law inconvenient, colonel ...
MATHIEU
And explode bombs public
places, respect law?
When asked question Ben
M'Hidi, remember said? No,
gentlemen, believe me, vicious
circle. And discuss problem
hours reaching
conclusions. Because problem
lie here. The problem is: NLF
wants leave Algeria want
remain. Now, that, despite
varying shades opinion, agree
remain. When rebellion
began, shades
opinion. All newspapers,
left-wing ones wanted rebellion
suppressed. And sent
reason. And
madmen sadists, gentlemen. Those
fascists today, forget
contribution
Resistance. Those Nazis,
know
survivors Dachau Buchenwald. We
soldiers duty
win. Therefore, precise, I

France remain Algeria? If answer
"yes," accept
necessary consequences.
