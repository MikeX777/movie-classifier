A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All looking
feeling like heavens supposed to.
After seconds calm, water mist screen

designed encase man's body. Made coarse, sickly-
stained red ands brown canvas velcro restraints
chafe, forever burn, skin they're wrapped
around, JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests
purpose: slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.
STARKS stripped blue uniform lying

MACKENZIE (cont'd)
Welcome village, William
Starks.
STARKS doesn't offer hand, looks MacKenzie.
STARKS [Looking away]
I'm mood talk.
MACKENZIE
That's bad. I don't believe
disposable language --

[running hand air]
court. [Beat, eager it's sad]
I'm ready throw ball. Come on.
STARKS looks MACKENZIE sees constant flow
words mouth masks tragic hesitation
eyes. A dead arm hangs limply side, like weight.
STARKS [Relenting]
What for?
MACKENZIE
I tried kill wife.
STARKS
Don't jail that?
MACKENZIE
I tried like 30 times.
There is, STARKS rightly figures, suitable response
that.
MACKENZIE
She's bigger me, she's
stronger me. And I planned
it. It
heat moment. I didn't beat
anything. Hell, beat me. But
we'd start fighting, I'd
knife. Then kept threatening
away, [looking
around] finally did.
As talks, MACKENZIE notes SCARS Starks' arms. Dr.
LORENSON observes STARKS MACKENZIE talking starts
walking them.
20.
STARKS
Yeah, 30 times probably
crazy.
MACKENZIE
Or plain stupid. You'd think
twentieth time, I'd
alternative method. Maybe
effective one, know I
mean.
DR. LORENSON
Morning, gentlemen. How

MACKENZIE winks discreetly STARKS replies.
MACKENZIE
It's hard me, Dr. Lorenson.
[Finally turns face her, grimly]
The world me, it's shrinking.
There's room light
way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da-
da-bum! I feel like horseman
doom coming me, Doc. Only
today, he's carrying flowers.
LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie turning Starks.
MACKENZIE
What? It's better fine.
DR. LORENSON
And you, Mr. Starks?
STARKS [Already defense]
I'm fine.
DR. LORENSON

uncharacteristically looks STARKS right eye.
21.
MACKENZIE
Hey...when talk

STARKS looks MacKenzie briskly, wondering words
directed meandering nut. But MacKenzie
nods farewell starts humming walks away --
dead arm tow.
DR. LORENSON
So you're ok?
STARKS [Still distracted]
What?
DR. LORENSON
I asked you're ok.
STARKS [Suspiciously]
I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You
think there's wrong me?
DR. LORENSON
I don't know. You're patient.
STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives over.
DR. LORENSON
You look like you've lost
weight. Are eating?
STARKS
I am. One things I
remember eating. So I guess
I exercising
dreams.
STARKS looks LORENSON, seeing he'll respond. LORENSON
looks curiously STARKS' pointed stare.
STARKS
You small talk?
DR. LORENSON
Sure.
STARKS
Good.
STARKS walks away slowly WEAKLY -- fact doesn't
escape LORENSON's observation.
22.
INT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAY
STARKS walks bathroom, keenly eyeing slit
WINDOWS wall. He walks closer them,
suddenly hears STRAINED BREATHING inside
stalls. He checks stall, pushing
open. It swings ways doesn't lock.
The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past second
stall then... WHACK! The door swings
way STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- head
barely missing fatal confrontation sink.
DAMON, ORDERLY, walks out.
DAMON
I'm sorry, Starks. Must seen

STARKS writhes PAIN -- straining breath now.
DAMON [Leaning close him]

DAMON HARDING undress him, STARKS makes
himself. They look DR. BECKER NODS

DAMON begrudgingly lets Starks steps

STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away
bends pants. On way up, GRABS THE
JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, like weapon, aims
smack Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks
JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force blow sends
Becker down, falls wall, DAMON

DR. GRIES

DAMON KICKS Starks hard back, nearly sending down.

BECKER looks sees BLOOD fall floor.
He looks STARKS who, pain, looks shocked

BECKER
Let go. [More firmly] I said, let

As soon let go, STARKS lunges BECKER --
pushing wall. STARKS stops, presumably
harm Becker unsure, himself,

BECKER looks fearlessly Starks' eyes.
24.
BECKER [An inch away face]

STARKS' face registers meaning Becker's words
