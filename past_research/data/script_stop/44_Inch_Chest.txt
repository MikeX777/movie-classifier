PROLOGUE
Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily.
Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night.
Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles...
And streets... Narrow. Grimy. Sooty. Rank...
Deserted...
Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict
buildings wharf warehouses rotten oaky loading
beams rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping
fetid water corroded dilapidated ancient ruined
guttering...
Moving... Turning... Into pinched, arched, alleyway -- If
darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken...
And listen -- If strain ears -- listen --
hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... "Take Me Back To
Dear Ol' Blighty " sung jolly girl long gone
bar surrounded drunken men...
We moving... The music growing... In distance faint
glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We

We stop... In middle nowhere... Dark nowhere...
music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All

The gable end old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly
broken, filthy window... All -- suddenly
comes crashing -- end wall comes crashing -
flurry bricks mortar... Crashing down... The tumble
masonry... And clouds brick-dust rubble
figures inside... Through smokey powdered fog
group men downstairs room derelict house...
On walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling parts reveal
older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded
up... A unmatched armchairs states disrepair
-- 60's black vinyl, deco-patterned smoker, 70's cream
plastic, brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours
room browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted...
In middle room, standing dusty, bare wooden
floorboards, fist clenched aggressively sides,
OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing dark piece
suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He squaring
