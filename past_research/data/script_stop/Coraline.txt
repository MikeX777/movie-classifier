LOCKS THE DOOR BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-
second later, OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
CRASH! Coraline THROWN BACK. But real-world door
lock, hold. It's over...
Coraline lies back, beat-up tired she's
been, GULPING breaths air till heart slows
little. The room brightly lit sunlight,
moved here, sky windows blue
white clouds.
She smiles, remembering, turns bag
ghost eyes snow globe parents inside.
She opens up, searches, shoving aside ghost eyes
garden shears. But snow globe GONE!
She gets fours, starts searching floor. Her
hand hits small PUDDLE fireplace, tiny
bits BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, another. She
looks mantel spots MISSING SNOW GLOBE.
