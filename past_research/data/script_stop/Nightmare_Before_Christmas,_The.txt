Jack's Lament
Performed Danny Elfman
There who'd deny, I I best
For talents renowned far wide
When comes surprises moonlit night
I excel trying
With slightest little effort ghostlike charms
I seen grown men shriek
With wave hand, well-placed moan
I swept bravest feet
Yet year year, it's routine
And I grow weary sound screams
And I, Jack, Pumpkin King
Have grown tired old thing
Oh, deep inside bones
An emptiness began grow
There's there, far home
A longing I've known
I'm master fright, demon light
And I'll scare right pants
To guy Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known England France
And I dead, I head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal man scream like I
With fury recitations
But understand
That Pumpkin King skeleton grin
Would tire crown, understood
He'd
Oh, there's place bones
That calls unknown
The fame praise come year year
