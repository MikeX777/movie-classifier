116 EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY 116
Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close
Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, cello strapped
precariously. The camera pulls cycling
streets Oxford. She's it. We follow
little while. She dismounts outside church
leans bike wall. Just she's leave
it, sees freezes. We follow gaze:
it's red Bristol, parked little way road
her. She scans street
David. She - he's coming round corner,
littler street, unwrapping packet
cigarettes. Jenny moves eye-line. He sees her,
stops, walks her.
115.
DAVID

Jenny says nothing.
DAVID

She looks shakes head, awaking
dream. A young man stops bike, dismounts,
leans bike wall hers, waits
finish. She turns David, young man
offers arm. They walk away together, David
stares longingly them.
