FADE IN:
INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)
A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, head resting
grimy wallpaper. She tense, sweaty, wide-eyed
concentration. This CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim,
pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor navy
windbreaker, khaki pants. Her hair piled
navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched right hand,
hovers ear. She raises speedloader, left
hand, locks cylinder, twists reloads.
CLOSE ON
A guest room door, small, wired pack attached
knob. Suddenly, wish sharp CRACK!, knob explodes,
door bursts open.
WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

hands back. Then, SWIVELLING... sees startled
MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing window
rifle hands. He turning her...
Clarice drops combat crouch, gun extended, shouts.
CLARICE
Freeze! FBI!
CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION
natural SOUND suspended - Suspect faces
strange, pleading expression. The rifle rising
hands, oddly enough, held chest,
pointing. Then puzzling registers...
THE SUSPECT'S HANDS
taped gun, away trigger; couldn't use
tried. Suddenly hear metallic CLICK,
registers unnatural amplification, - Clarice reacts,
drops floor, rolling sideways, -
THE "HOSTAGE"
pulls revolver back, SLOW
MOTION, raising untied hands. She fires repeatedly,
flames leaping muzzle; SOUND echoing roar
close quarters, -
Clarice come knee, armchair,
firing herself, quick SHOTS, send -
THE "HOSTAGE"
pitching bed, backwards, shudder lie
haze gunsmoke. Clarice rushes her, clamping
knee gun hand, keeping covered case
movement. HOLD beats... hear shrill
blast WHISTLE somewhere, screen, normal
ACTION SOUND restored.
BRIGHAM (O.S.)
Okay, people, good exercise...
Clarice relaxes, lowering gun. The lights brighten.
PULLING BACK
we're sort auditorium, "hotel
room" "corridor" built training set. JOHN BRIGHAM
walks set, thumbing stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-
Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor /
FBI Academy."
BRIGHAM
Starling's reaction time
excellent. Let's break. Critique
five.
A class young FBI trainees, sexes,
begins rise seats, mingling chatting.
Clarice nods amiably "Suspect", gives
"Hostage" hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, roommate. Her
broad, clever face breaks big smile,
remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice soft trace
southern accent.
ARDELIA
Damn, Clarice, how'd me?
CLARICE
(indicating gun)
Never cock. Just squeeze.
ARDELIA
(grins)
I love talk dirty.
As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist star pupil's
little smile pride. He frowns good-naturedly.
BRIGHAM
What're laughin' at, Junior G-
Man? She got rounds
two.
He takes steel-coiled grip flexer, drops
palm.
BRIGHAM
(continuing)
One reps, hand,
day. Now tidy up, Section Chief
wants you.
He nods direction, moves off. Clarice, smile
finally fading, looks auditorium.
SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD
sits step aisle, looking her. He
53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits
door. He carries think manila envelope
arm.
Ardelia helping Clarice unbuckle bullet-proof
vest, follows worried gaze.
CLARICE
What'd I do?
ARDELIA
Stay cool. Just remember
"God."
CUT TO:
EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY
Crawford watching group trainees firing range,
Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master
student, sense subtle, muted tug sexuality.
CRAWFORD
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
CLARICE
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
CRAWFORD
Your instructors tell you're
well. Top quarter class.
CLARICE
I hope so. They haven't posted
anything.
CRAWFORD
A job's come I thought
you. Not job, -
interesting errand. Walk
car, Starling.
They begin cross academy grounds. A group trainees
jogs by, matching sweats, following p.e. coach.
CRAWFORD
We're trying interview
serial killers custody,
psychobehavioral profile. Could
big help unsolved cases. Most
happy talk us.
They compulsion boast,
people... Do spook easily,
Starling?
CLARICE
Not yet.
CRAWFORD
You see, want refuses
cooperate. I want
today, asylum.
CLARICE
Who's subject?
CRAWFORD
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal
Lecter.
Clarice stops walking, goes still. A beat.
CLARICE
The cannibal...
Crawford doesn't respond, study face.
CLARICE
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad
chance, sir, - me?
CRAWFORD
You're qualified available. And
frankly, I can't spare real agent
right now.
He walks again, faster clip. She hurried up.
CRAWFORD
I don't expect talk you,
I able
tried... Lecter brilliant
psychiatrist, knows
dodges.
(hands manila
envelope)
Dossier him, copy
questionnaire, special ID you...
If won't talk, I want straight
reporting. How's look, how's
cell look, what's writing? The
Director report,
signature - I decide
it's good enough. I want
0800 Wednesday,
yourself.
They're reached car. His driver stamps cigarette,
climbs wheel. BURROUGHS, assistant, says
walkie-talkie, opens door.
But Crawford pulls aside, hand shoulder. His
intensity scary.
CRAWFORD
Now. I want attention,
Starling. Are listening me?
CLARICE
Yes sir.
CRAWFORD
Be careful Hannibal Lecter.
Dr. Chilton asylum
physical procedures
him. Do deviate them,
reason. You tell
personal, Starling. Believe me,
don't want Hannibal Lecter inside
head... Just job,
forget is.
CLARICE
(a bit unnerved)
And that, sir?
CHILTON (V.O.)
Oh, he's monster. A pure
psychopath...
CUT TO:
INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE
CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY
CLOSE ON ID card held male hand. Clarice's photo,
official-looking graphics. It calls "Federal
Investigator."
CHILTON (O.S.)
It's rare capture alive.
From research point view, Dr.
Lecter prized asset...
DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks card. A smarmy little
peacock, vast desk; he's conceived instant,
hopeless letch Clarice. He smiles, stroking card
beloved gold pen.
CHILTON
You know, lot detectives
here, I say, I can't
remember attractive...
NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE
wearing feminine skirt suit. Hair neatly coiled,
elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. He rudely left
standing.
CHILTON
Will Baltimore overnight...?
Because fun town,
right guide.
Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, hide distaste him.
CLARICE
I'm sure it's great town, Dr.
Chilton, instructions
talk Lecter report
afternoon.
CHILTON
(pause, sourly)
I see.
(beat)
Let's quick, then. I'm
busy.
CUT TO:
INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY
Clarice flinches heavy steel gate CLANGS shut
her, bolt shooting home. Chilton walks ahead her.
CHILTON
Lecter carved people -
we're sure - cooked
favorite bits. We've tried study
him, course - he's
sophisticated standard tests.
And my, hate us! Thinks I'm
nemesis... Crawford's clever,
isn't he? Using you.
CLARICE
How mean, Dr. Chilton?
CHILTON
A pretty young woman, turn
on? I don't believe Lecter's
seen woman years. And oh,
"taste" -
speak.
CLARICE
I graduated magna UVA, Doctor.
It's charm school.
CHILTON
Good. Then able
remember rules.
CUT TO:
INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY
A darker, grimmer area. Heavy grids lights.
Distant SLAMMINGS faint, hoarse SHOUTS. They walk briskly.
CHILTON
Do reach bars,
touch bars. You pass
soft paper - pens
pencils. No staples paperclips
paper. Use sliding food
carrier, exceptions. Do accept
attempts hold
you. Do understand me?
CLARICE
I understand.
CHILTON
I'm going insist
precautions... On
afternoon July 8, 1981,
complained chest pains
taken dispensary. His
mouthpiece restraints removed
EKG. When nurse bent
him, her...
He hands Clarice small, dog-eared photo. Looking it,
stopped tracks. This pleases Chilton.
CHILTON
The doctors managed re-set
jaw, less, save
eyes. His pulse got
eighty-five, ate
tongue.
(pauses, smiles)
I here.
He turns, pushes button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open,
BARNEY - big, impassive orderly - awaits
anteroom. On walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace,
tranquilizer guns.
CLARICE
(quickly blocking him)
Dr. Chilton - Lecter feels you're
enemy - you've said -
maybe I'll luck myself.
What think?
CHILTON
(annoyed)
You suggested
office, saved time.
CLARICE
But I would've missed
pleasure company.
She holds photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching.
CHILTON
When she's finished, bring out.
He turns heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly.
BARNEY
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't
near bars?
CLARICE
(shaking hand)
Clarice Starling. Yes, did.
BARNEY
Okay. Past others, it's
cell. Stay middle. I
chair you.
Sensing tension, indicates nearby security monitor.
BARNEY
I'm watching. You'll fine.
Clarice nods gratefully. She looks long corridor,
takes deep breath, walks it. He watches go.
CUT TO:
INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY
MOVING SHOT - Clarice, footsteps ECHO. High
right, surveillance cameras. On left, cells. Some
padded, narrow observation slits, normal,
barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly
dark figure next-to-last cell hurtles her,
face mashing grotesquely bars hisses.
DARK FIGURE
I c-can sssmell cunt!
Clarice flinches momentarily, walks on.
DR. LECTER'S CELL
coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind barred wall
second barrier stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted-
furniture, softcover books papers. On walls,
extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, European
cityscapes, charcoal crayon.
Clarice stops, polite distance bars, clears
throat.
CLARICE
Dr. Lecter... My Clarice
Starling. May I talk you?
Dr. Hannibal Lecter lounging bunk, white pajamas,
reading Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face
long sun, leached -
glittering eyes, wet red mouth. He rises smoothly,
crossing stand her; gracious host. His voice
cultured, soft.
DR. LECTER
Good morning.
CUTTING BETWEEN THEM
Clarice comes measured distance closer.
CLARICE
Doctor, hard problem
psychological profiling. I want
ask help
questionnaire.
DR. LECTER
"We" Behavioral Science
Unit, Quantico. You're
Jack Crawford's, I expect.
CLARICE
I am, yes.
DR. LECTER
May I credentials?
Clarice surprised, fishes ID card bag,
holds inspection. He smiles, soothingly.
DR. LECTER
Closer, please... Clo-ser...
She complies time, trying hide fear. Dr. Lecter's
nostrils lift, gently, like animal, tests air.
Then smiles, glancing card.
DR. LECTER
(continuing)
That expires week. You're
real FBI, you?
CLARICE
I'm - training
Academy.
DR. LECTER
Jack Crawford sent trainee me?
CLARICE
We're talking psychology,
Doctor, Bureau. Can decide
I'm
qualified?
DR. LECTER
Mmmmm... That's slippery
you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
She sits folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely
till she's settled, sits himself, faces happily.
DR. LECTER
Now then. What Miggs you?
(she puzzled)
"Multiple Miggs," cell.
He hissed you. What say?
CLARICE
He said - "I smell cunt."
DR. LECTER
I see. I cannot. You use Evyan
skin cream, wear
L'Air du Temps, today. You
brought best bag, though, didn't
you?
CLARICE
(beat)
Yes.
DR. LECTER
It's better shoes.
CLARICE
Maybe they'll catch up.
DR. LECTER
I doubt it.
CLARICE
(shifting uncomfortably)
Did drawings, Doctor?
DR. LECTER
Yes. That's Duomo, seen
Belvedere. Do know Florence?
CLARICE
All detail, memory...?
DR. LECTER
Memory, Officer Starling, I
instead view.
A pause, Clarice takes questionnaire case.
CLARICE
Dr. Lecter, you'd consider -
DR. LECTER
No, no, no. You fine,
you'd courteous receptive
courtesy, you'd established trust
embarrassing truth
Miggs, ham-handed segue
questionnaire. It won't
do. It's stupid boring.
CLARICE
I'm asking look this,
Doctor. Either won't.
DR. LECTER
Jack Crawford busy
he's recruiting help
student body. Busy hunting new
one, Buffalo Bill... Such naughty
boy! Did Crawford send ask
advice him?
CLARICE
No, I came need -
DR. LECTER
How women used, Bill?
CLARICE
Five... far.
DR. LECTER
All flayed...?
CLARICE
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's
active case, I'm involved. If -
DR. LECTER
Do know he's called Buffalo
Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't
say.
CLARICE
I'll tell you'll look
form.
(he considers,
nods)
It started bad joke Kansas
City Homicide. They said...
likes skin humps.
DR. LECTER
Witless misleading. Why
think takes skins, Officer
Starling? Thrill wisdom.
CLARICE
It excites him. Most serial killers
sort trophies.
DR. LECTER
I didn't.
CLARICE
No. You ate yours.
A tense beat, smile him, small boldness.
DR. LECTER
Send through.
She rolls questionnaire, sliding food tray.
He rises, glances it, turning page disdainfully.
DR. LECTER
Oh, Officer Starling... think
dissect blunt
little tool?
CLARICE
No. I hoped knowledge -
Suddenly whips tray her, metallic CLANG
makes start. His voice remains pleasant purr.
DR. LECTER
You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?
You know look like me,
good bag cheap
shoes? You look like rube. A well-
scrubbed, hustling rube little,
taste... Good nutrition given
length bone, you're
generation
poor white trash, Officer
Starling...? That accent you're trying
desperately shed - pure West
Virginia. What father, dear?
Was coal miner? Did stink
lamp...? And oh, quickly
boys you! All tedious,
sticky fumblings, seats
cars, dream
getting out. Getting -
yes? Getting way -
F...B...I.
His word struck like tiny, precise dart. But
squares jaw won't ground.
CLARICE
You lot, Dr. Lecter. But
strong point high-
powered perception yourself? How
it...? Look
write truth.
(she slams tray
him)
Or maybe you're afraid to.
DR. LECTER
You're tough one, aren't you?
CLARICE
Reasonably so. Yes.
DR. LECTER
And you'd hate think
common. My, wouldn't sting!
Well you're far common, Officer
Starling. All fear
it.
(beat)
Now excuse me. Good day.
CLARICE
And questionnaire...?
DR. LECTER
A census taker tried test
me. I ate liver fava
beans nice chianti... Fly
school, little Starling.
He steps backwards, returns cot,
remote statue. Frustrated, Clarice hesitates,
finally shoulders bag goes, leaving
questionnaire tray. But steps,
passes -
MIGG'S CELL
She sees creature bars again, hissing her.
MIGGS
I b-bit wrist I c-can diiiieeee!
S-ee bleeeeeeeeds?
The dark figure suddenly flings palm her, -
CLARICE
spattered face neck - blood,
pale droplets semen. She gives little cry, touching
fingers wetness. Stunned, near tears, forces
straighten walk on, fumbling tissue.
From her, Dr. Lecter calls out, agitated.
DR. LECTER (O.S.)
Officer Starling... Officer Starling!
Clarice slows, stops. She shudders, makes
difficult choice turn, walk back, stand -
DR. LECTER
Who's shivering rage. For instant face opens,
catch glimpse hell itself. Then he's composed
again.
DR. LECTER
I happen
you. Discourtesy - unspeakably
ugly me.
CLARICE
Then - test me.
DR. LECTER
No. But I happy...
I'll chance
love most, Clarice Starling.
CLARICE
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
DR. LECTER
Advancement, course.
(beat)
Go Split City. See Miss Mofet,
old patient mine. M-O-F-E-T...
Now go. Go.
(a smile)
I don't think Miggs manage
soon, crazy -
you?
CUT TO:
EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY
The grim gothic pile asylum looms overhead Clarice
rushes doors. She badly shaken,
stumbling, rubs face. She looks for,
finally, relief, spots -
HER CAR

MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV
car - late 60's vintage - parked dirt road. A MAN,

THE YOUNG CLARICE
rushes them, sweeps hug, spinning
around, CAMERA SPINNING them, capturing

Clarice, combat stance, wearing sound-muffling
headset, squeezing ROUND ROUND
A MOVING TARGET
The silhouette man, approaching track. Her shots,

Clarice stares it, deftly working speedloader. Then

FOREHEAD.
CUT TO:
INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT
CLOSE ON microfilm monitor - grainy newsphoto Dr.
Lecter, scrawling past, accompanying story ("New
Horrors Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.
Clarice punching keys terminal. Other trainees
study nearby tables.
She pauses, jotting note pad, Ardelia comes by,
carrying armful books.
ARDELIA
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
CLARICE
Thanks, Ardelia.
MOVING ANGLE
Clarice rises, grabbing notebook, follows Ardelia
past high metal bookstacks.
ARDELIA
You missed Fourth Amendment law.
Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff.
Where afternoon?
CLARICE
Pleading crazy man, come

Ardelia stares her, figures it's put-on, laughs.
ARDELIA
Damn. Wish I time social
life.
Clarice grins, Ardelia indicates phone receiver resting
check-out desk, moves on. Clarice picks up.
CLARICE
(on phone)
Mr. Crawford?
CUT TO:
INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
Crawford, cardigan, sits wing chair book-
lined study suburban home. He turns pages
Clarice's memo talk. His tone sharp.
CRAWFORD
I've read interim memo Lecter.
You sure you've left out?
INTERCUTTING
CLARICE
It's there, sir, practically
verbatim.
CRAWFORD
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
CLARICE
(a bit heatedly)
Right kleenex I used.
(he silent)
Sir, why? Is wrong?
CRAWFORD
He mentioned name,
end. "Mofet..." Any followup her?
CLARICE
I spent evening mainframe.
Lecter altered destroyed
patient histories, prior
capture. No record named
Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like

divorce. I tracked
library's catalogue national
yellow pages.
(glancing notes)
It's mini-storage facility outside
Baltimore, Lecter
practice.
She pauses, expecting soft approval
cleverness.
CRAWFORD
Well? Why aren't right
now?
CLARICE
Sir, that's field job. It's outside
scope assignment. And I've
got test tomorrow -
CRAWFORD
Do recall instructions
you, Starling? What they?
CLARICE
To complete file report
0800 Wednesday. But sir -
CRAWFORD
Then that, Starling. Do
exactly that.
CLARICE
Sir, it? There's
you're telling me.
CRAWFORD
(beat)
Miggs murdered.
CLARICE
(startled, upset)
Murdered...? How?
CRAWFORD
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
him, afternoon, Miggs
crying. They bed check.
He'd swallowed tongue...
Chilton scared stiff family
file civil rights lawsuit,
he's trying blame you.
I told little prick conduct
flawless.
(beat)
Starling...?
CLARICE
I'm here, sir, I - I don't know
feel it.
CRAWFORD
You don't feel way
it. Lecter amuse himself.
Why not, do? Take away
books awhile, jello...
(a bit softer)
I know got ugly today. But
report, Starling -
far can. On time,
outside class. Now carry on.
ANGLE ON CLARICE
hear loud CLICK Crawford hanging up. She stares
receiver, stung abruptness.
CLARICE
Well God damn it! You old creep.
Creepo son bitch. Let Miggs
squirt like it.
She slams receiver cradle.
ANGLE ON CRAWFORD
flips aside memo, rises, wearily. He leaves
study, flicking lamp, pads away
slippers.
CUT TO:
INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A private nurse, white, stands marking clipboard chart,
Crawford enters tidy bedroom.
CRAWFORD
I'll over, Patricia. You

The nurse nods, hands chart, goes. He glances

THUNDER RAIN...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)
An orange neon sign, streaked rain, identifies
location. It looms hurricane fence, topped barbed

Pre-paid full... The contract
"Miss Hester Mofet."
CUT TO:
EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK
Clarice, kneeling closed, roll-up metal door, takes
FLASH photo sealed padlock. EVERETT YOW, fat,
60ish Chinaman, holds umbrella both. He looks
unhappy.
CLARICE
So one's -
1980?
She opens padlock, fat ring tagged keys,
sets aside keys lock.
MR. YOW
Not knowledge. Privacy
great concern customers. But,
FBI matter...
CLARICE
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I
promise. Be gone know it.
Slinging camera shoulder, tugs handle,
door won't budge. Another tug, harder - good. Mr.
Yow stoops help, puffing hard, it's firmly stuck. He
sighs.
MR. YOW
We return tomorrow,
son. Or workmen...?
Clarice crosses Pinto, faces shed, reaches
turn headlights. Mr. Yow blinks sudden
brightness. Then opens truck, rummaging inside,
returns bumper jack, flashlight, rubber floor
mat.
CLARICE
Would hold these, please?
She gives flashlight camera, drops mat
ground, sets bumper jack place,
center door. She pumps jack handle door
SQUEALS slowly up, won't higher 18
inches, despite exertions. She spreads rubber
mat cement, takes flashlight Mr. Yow,
lies mat.
CUT TO:
INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)
Clarice, backlit, peers door. She reaches in, makes
sweep flashlight. We catch shadowy outlines -
boxes, flattened tires car...
SOUND rain tin roof, noises, - small
RUSTLINGS. Mr. Yow's chubby face appears
Clarice's.
MR. YOW
It smells like mice... I think I
hear them, - don't you?
Clarice turns back, starts squirming door.
MR. YOW
You're going there?
CUT BACK TO:
EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK
Clarice pulls head again, reaching

nonchalant.
CLARICE
Mr. Yow, door fall

number? It's Baltimore field
office. They know you're

MR. YOW
Might I suggest tucking pants
socks? To prevent mouse
intrusion.
CLARICE
(beat)
Good idea.
CUT BACK TO:
INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)
Clarice squirms, back, narrow opening. As
squeezes way in, snags thigh metal
edge door. She curses softly, shining flashlight
ripped khakis - there's small streak blood.
MR. YOW (O.S.)
Okay, Miss Starling?
CLARICE
Okay, Mr. Yow...
She shines light around. In narrow beam, -
CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING
spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks cardboard boxes...
dusty pieces furniture... big car, oddly long
tall, covered tarp... Suddenly there's scurrying
loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, beam
capturing... old upright piano.
MR. YOW (O.S.)
You're playing piano, Miss Starling?
CLARICE
That wasn't me.
MR. YOW (O.S.)
Oh.
Clarice crawls bit further. There's hardly room stand,
finally manages wriggle upright, clawing away
cobwebs, car. Holding light arm,
takes FLASH photos shed's interior, ending
car. Then, slinging camera shoulder,
folds tarp, resting roof. The resulting
clouds dust cough.
THE CAR
antique beauty, 1931 Packard. It's dusty, despite
tarp. Curtains close passenger compartment,
there's narrow gap them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.
CLARICE
peers gap, aiming flashlight.
HER POV - SHIFTING
flashlight beam picks out: broad seat...
open album lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... crumpled
lap rug, floor... pair women's shiny,
high-heeled pumps... Above these, hem fancy satin
evening gown - pair pale, stockinged legs.
Clarice recoils, alarmed, steadies herself.
CLARICE
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks
like somebody sitting
car.
MR. YOW (O.S.)
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe better
come now, Miss Starling.
CLARICE
Not yet! - wait me.
(under breath)
Maybe seconds.
She leans camera, takes FLASH
gap, tries door handle. Locked. So
door. She looks around, aiming light, locates tangle
coat-hangers, sticking carton bric-a-brac.
She pulls these, straightens quickly, bends
tip hook.
CLOSE ANGLE
jams tool inside join
passenger window, fishes till snag
inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.
Clarice opens door - hits stacked boxes, won't
open far - cautiously leans inside, aiming
flashlight.
HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM
revealing evening gown... pair hands,
white, elbow-length gloves - rests lap,
atop large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... strands
costume pearls breasts... finally white
neck stub female mannequin. No face head.
CLARICE
sighs relief. She takes couple FLASHES,
carefully lifts Valentine album, holding
corners, setting atop car. Then eases
inside, seat, springs SQUEAK
loudly.
ONE GLOVED HAND slides lap, brushing Clarice's thigh.
Clarice starts bit, pokes gloved arm, hard.
She peels bit glove, revealing white, synthetic
elbow. She smiles, shaking head jumpiness,
reaches mannequin's lap loosen evening
bag's drawstring.
A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares her, beaded
material slides away.
Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, long, heart-
pounding moments pass look
closely.
The head bobs gently pool alcohol, laboratory
specimen jar. It man's head, grotesquely transformed,
addition heavy makeup, earrings, sodden wig,
woman's face. Over years makeup smeared
badly, pupils gone milky white.
CLARICE
staring terrible thing, pleased

DR. LECTER
I I saw case file. You

CLARICE
Why don't tell "Miss

Or I wait lab?
DR. LECTER

His real Benjamin Raspail. A

Dr. Lecter slowly turns rheostat cell. As

She stands, too, startled. They face other.
DR. LECTER
Punishment, see. For Miggs. Just

CLARICE
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You

feet away...
MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE
crawls forward, elbows, following gun,
bumps Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He lying
back, chest bloody mess. She slides muzzle

needed. He stares upwards, goggles, bloody lips
working. He tries speak, cannot. One hand reaches
slowly upwards, fingers twitching, seize
something, overhead... Then final, ghastly groan, hand
drops, dead. Clarice feels pulse neck,
making sure. Then, then, permit
roll over, collapsing him.
OVERHEAD ANGLE
