Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so.
NORMAN
Then I here?
BARNES
What?
NORMAN
What need for?

Bring grid, you?
ANGLE ON THE MONITOR IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins form.
NORMAN
What it? A military spacecraft?
Like shuttle satellite?
BARNES
Something like that.
(beat)
That doesn't surprise you?

A half mile long?
BARNES
The wing dimension larger
aircraft we've seen.
The team members sit conference table:
TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish happy here. BETH
HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother who's worn apron.
ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy quiet. HARRY ADAMS, 32,
mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, bullshit.
HARRY
How damage?
BARNES
To craft? None. Not scratch.
HARRY
Right. So you're saying survived
high speed impact water
scratch?
BARNES
I'm saying anything, Harry, I'm
stating facts.
(continuing)
The outer metal
titanium alloy, built epoxy-
resin honeycomb. The necessary
technology bond type
metal invented.
TED
Never invented?

BETH
To spacecraft. To investigate.
NORMAN
Underwater?
BETH
What expect? For

NORMAN
We can't there. We're

years training, Beth. We're
scientists. Lab scietists. We wear
ties lab coats work --
oxygen tanks.
BETH
Well, realized
chances encounter like
happen here. In ocean.
(off look)
70 percent earth's surface
water, Norman. That's grade
geography.
NORMAN
It occurred me.
BETH
Well, let's pray that's
mistake made. Have said

The SUB descends AIRLOCK, metal clanks metal. Around
it, DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit lights.
INT. AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM
CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.
OFFICER (O.S.)
One moment pressurizing.
A SOFT WHIRR.
ANGLE ON -- Barnes remaining team members standing
small, claustrophobic pressurizing room. Like sardines. Nobody says
anything. A long beat.
THE DOOR
them, opens. TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, big-boned female
officer, stands them. She wears black plastic PAD,
"talker", neck.
She hands member "talker". Norman takes his.
INT. DH-8 HALLWAY
Fletcher leads Barnes team members hallway. Each
wears "talkers" necks.
BARNES
They pressurize helium.
NORMAN
What's wrong oxygen?
BARNES
It's corrosive gas. On earth,
makes half-eaten apple turn brown
puts ugly, iron rust
Oldsmobile. At pressure low,
oxygen toxic. Breathe
here, it'll dick
Oldsmobile.
TED
Important safety tip. Thanks
Captain.
Fletcher listens radio earpiece, turns Barnes...

MONITOR clicks -- showing robot's POV door.
TED
Captain, know, I
appreciate hauling thousand
feet sea level watch
historical event television.
BARNES
Nobody goes inside, know
what's inside.
ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans spacecraft hull, stops
rectangular panel mounted left door.
BARNES
Can open panel?
EDMUNDS
Working now, sir.
ON THE MONITOR -- robotic CLAW extends panel. Trying
pry panel open.
TED
I'd like noted report
I think
ourselves. Making manned entry...
The claw clumsy, keeps banging metal.
TED
I'd like noted --
BARNES
Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try
suction.
ON THE MONITOR -- robotic arm extends out, rubber
sucker. It pushes panel, doesn't suck.
EDMUNDS
It's sucking, sir.
BARNES
Thank you, I that. Try
else.
EDMUNDS
We don't try,
Sir.
BARNES
Well, shit -- something,

TED
It's like swimming, Norman...
You know swim, don't you?
HARRY
You're afraid water,

They look him.
BETH
(half smiling)
Isn't psychological term
that, Dr. Johnson?
NORMAN
(under breath)
Yeah. Drowning.
INT. AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)
Dressed jumpsuits helmets -- Barnes jumps POOL ocean
water, cut floor, leading ocean. It looks like
tiny swimming pool. Ted jumps next. Beth, Harry, Norman

HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.
ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning walk ocean floor.
HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly muddy ground.
NORMAN'S POV -- barely him,
helmet lights STROBING dark water, crossing other, like
searchlights foggy night.
CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING. Couple beats. And
HEARS:
TED (O.S.)
Look thing.
Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...
LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT team -- little helmet lights tiny
insignificant as...
IN FRONT OF THEM -- SPACECRAFT. Dwarfing size, looming
large, majestic, like we've seen. The enormous tail fin,
distance, extends high coral.
In huge MOUND OF CORAL covering spacecraft, WE SEE tunnel --
cut like cave -- lined tiny, dim lightbulbs.
INT. TUNNEL
About 60 feet deep. Narrower they'd like. Norman descends,
clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing bulky, iron handles fastened
coral walls.
THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR
INT. SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK
CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE watches water recede, past
faceplate.
THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL
Ted wedged crowbar door BANGS

They away, cramming far corner airlock Ted
keeps swinging.
BETH
Looks alot like airplane door,

NORMAN
Take look.
Barnes comes him. The follow. Barnes bends down, looks

BARNES
I did.
HARRY

ON BETH -- touches door palms, feels around.
BETH
There's heat coming door.
BARNES
Back away then.
BETH
Wait minute --

THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE
Barnes unstraps GUN -- nearly size uzzi --

BARNES
Ted, away door.
TED
What going -- shoot

The RUMBLING louder...
BARNES
Get away!
THE DOOR begins slide open.
Beth backs away.
THE DOOR, sliding, revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside. The door
stops, it's open, it's quiet. They stand there, looking
BLACKNESS. A long beat.
INT. SPACECRAFT
ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside. His helmet light SHINES

Metallic BEAMS RAFTERS criss-cross them.
Norman looks railing -- light STROBES 40 feet
darkness, dimly lighting LOWER HULL, dense network STRUTS
GIRDERS.
TED
Look this.
BARNES
What it?
Ted SPOTLIGHTS OUTER HULL.
TED
Some sort lead something.
BARNES
Radiation shield, think?
TED
A foot half thick? That'd
withstand helluva lot
radiation.
Beth's light SHINES CATWALK. WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined
dusty floor.
BETH
Hold --
BARNES
What it?
BETH
Any ahead -- walk
far up?
TED
No. I don't think so.
BETH
Well, think. Because there's
footprints aren't mine.
TED
Well, they're mine.
ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like boots they're wearing.
BARNES
Calm down, alright? They gotta
somebody's here. Let's stay
together, please.
CUT TO:
LONG SHOT -- seeing suspended high air catwalk,
walking. Their tiny streams LIGHT moving about. WE SEE
ominous spacecraft is.
BETH
It's empty. Why build
ship like this?
HARRY
You'd ask them.
They approach DOOR, end catwalk.
BARNES
Alright, Beth, thing
before.
BETH
How I press button?
She presses button near door. The door SLIDES open.
BARNES
Or just... press button.
Barnes holds gun, enters. The him.

comfortable looking.
They begin slowly wander about...
BETH
I don't it.
TED
It doesn't sense.
HARRY
You don't think does? I think
it's obvious.
TED
Is sort joke? Like
hoaxes?
HARRY
A spacecraft half mile long --
500 tonnes coral
it? Someone went lot
trouble. Try again.
TED
But it's impossible.
HARRY
Is it?
Beth touches table, it's metal, it's soft rubbery.
TED
Why ship carry
instructions English?
HARRY
Think it.
TED
Unless, alien spacecraft --
know -- presenting
Americans way
feel comfortable.
NORMAN
400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher
Columbus would've loved
accomodations.
BETH
Good theory, Ted.
TED
Well, what's theory?
BETH
I'm woman. I don't theorize. I
deal facts.
HARRY
All facts need right
you.
TED
Gimme minute here... I think I've
got it.
HARRY
Do you?
TED
If alien spacecraft --
HARRY
Save breath. It's alien
spacecraft.
BETH
Then it?
HARRY
(beat)
It's American spacecraft.
TED
An American spacecraft? Half mile
long? And buried 400 years? Yeah,
good theory, Harry.
HARRY
It's obvious start,
hasn't it, Captain? That's
secrecy, told
it?
BARNES
We considered it.
TED
Considered what? That it's American?
How think it's American?
HARRY
The chip door.
ON NORMAN -- glancing Harry...
HARRY
We weeny little wedge, bang
couple times, bust
chunk metal. Yet
spacecraft -- low
velocity, 200 miles hour --
crashes water -- it's gonna
like hitting concrete,
crumple like paper. But isn't
dent seen anywhere. Not
scratch.
TED
Meaning?
HARRY
Meaning didn't land water.
TED
Please. It flown --
HARRY
It didn't fly here. It arrived here.
TED
Arrived? From where?
HARRY
Not where. When. 400 years ago. From

Harry pauses, looks down, punches keys...
ON THE SCREEN -- expands size, widens them, curving...
WE SEE galaxy stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN,
room, dimensional, suspended air, giving
illusion depth.
The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like
we're flying it.
The stars space matter streaking by.
BETH
What's cluster stars there?
In center?
Harry stares, walking desk, moving 3-D image...
HARRY

HARRY
Time travel. A black hole.
The CLUSTER stars grows brighter brighter, comes closer

NORMAN
Picked something? What it?
BARNES (O.S.)
I don't know. But it's
alien.
CUT TO:
INT. CARGO BAY
ANGLE ON team members' BOOTS, distance. AS WE PAN UP
AROUND WE SEE curved surface appear: surface slowly
swirling green blue fluids. Like mercury. Mesmerizlng.
AS WE COME AROUND, team stands looking SPHERE, 30 feet
dlameter, held GIANT CLAW gripping top.
They walk it, circling it, looking it.
HARRY
This answers questions.
NORMAN
Which one? Let list out.
HARRY
This spacecraft designed pick
things up. They things want

sphere. Find interesting,
curious. They draw inside

NORMAN
But way home, miss

BARNES
But do? This... sphere.
TED
Maybe it's message sort,
know? See red here.
ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- dark red MARKINGS it's surface...
TED
(continuing)
Looks like design, writing,
maybe. Maybe sent meet
spacecraft message.
HARRY
Look closely. That isn't writing.
Those grooves.
ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved surface.
HARRY
No. They don't represent message.
They aren't decorative all. They
purpose entirely.
BARNES
What?
HARRY
To conceal small break
surface sphere.
BARNES
A break what?
INT. HABITAT -- HALLWAY

NORMAN
If alien, maybe shouldn't

HARRY
(nodding Norman)
Man man, knows man,
think
knows. The anthropomorphic problem.
Good, Norman.
BARNES
The what?
NORMAN
I mentioned report. Didn't
read report?
HARRY
Everything written extra-
terrestial life imagines life
essentially human. If doesn't
look human, it's reptile big
insect something, having human
values, human understanding.
BARNES
So? What's problem?
HARRY
It's nonsense. There's
difference species
prove that.
BETH
Take politics, views
abortion, death penalty...
HARRY
Cannibalism, extreme. And
we're talking new life form.
Their values ethics
incomprehensible.
BARNES
Like "Thou shall kill"?
NORMAN
Or maybe, can't killed.
BARNES
You mean, what's thing
immortal?
NORMAN
I don't know. That's point.
BARNES
Everything killed.
BETH
Not everything. Even earth. Take
... yeasts.
BARNES
Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, I don't
think we're gonna open
loaf bread.
HARRY
And we're talking three-
dimensional creatures. What it's
seven-dimensional? So
dimensional couldn't
kill it.
NORMAN
Good point. I don't know you're
talking about, good point.
BARNES
Or contain great
benefit us, astonishing new
idea technology help mankind.
HARRY
It could. But odds
use it.
BARNES
You don't know that.
HARRY
Let's thing

It's before,

definitely nonrandom. See...
Harry sitting monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, Edmunds
PRINTOUT screan -- indicating pattern.
HARRY
It's single sequence repeated

BARNES
We're proud you, Harry,
hell it?
TED
Maybe it's message?
EDMUNDS
From what?
TED
The sphere. Maybe sphere --
EDMUNDS
We're hooked sphere.
HARRY
Well, it's discharge --
TED
It's discharge. Right,
Edmunds? You said before, right? So
it's gotta message.
BARNES
From sphere?
TED
What's inside sphere.
HARRY
If message, it's probably
substitution code. I'll work it.
TED
Yeah, I'll work it, too.
BARNES

You that.
INT. BATHROOM/SHOWER AREA
Ted, nervous, anxious -- printouts hand --

He's manic, Norman. You know that?
This reliance Harry misplaced.
You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's
overlooking things. Obvious things.
NORMAN
Like what?
Ted hands printout...
TED
It's fucking substitution
code, it's direct visual
representation.
NORMAN
You mean picture?
TED
Take look. I rearranged

Go ahead. Squint it.
NORMAN

Squint harder.

Don't it? It's picture

NORMAN
Well, wait
Harry comes with?

Sure, not. Give trophy.

... I asked myself,
sphere code? If you're
trying communicate, use
code?
TED
(to Norman)
See? No code. What'd I say?
HARRY
Codes hiding information. So
it's making mistake. It's making
code intending to. I figured
it's probably substituting numbers
letters... Then I began wonder
alien intelligence

we're getting spirals, I imagined
keyboard spiral. So I
translated it...
NORMAN
That's brilliant.
Ted grimaces Norman.

ON TED AND NORMAN -
TED
Don't gimme psychology

hard data up.
With intellect like this,
emotions don't mean shit.

But sir, I think it's imperative. I
think messages, animals
we've seen, killed Edmunds,
reading got earlier -- I think
they're related.
TED
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said
earlier -- friends --
NORMAN
Of course did. He's isloated
400 years. He wants
talk to. Look, human
isolation days,
neurotic,
psychotic. We're talking 400
years here. An alien shows
emotional responses. I think need
address him, reacts
further.
BARNES
You think killed Edmunds?
NORMAN
Yes, I do. Whatever's there, I
think response refusing
talk earlier.
BARNES
Bullshit. What's isn't
alien. It's animal.
NORMAN
Maybe so. But I think need ask
Jerry it.
BARNES
No. I think shut
communication lines inside
