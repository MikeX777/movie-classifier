MELKONIS
No. It's small support

ROBY
Couldn't pyramid built

STANDARD
Too primitive. It's pre-

MELKONIS
They're dead civilization;

BROUSSARD (CONT'D)

Roby quickly fills bigger container hands Broussard,

ROBY
Do remember pyramid?
BROUSSARD
No. Just horrible dreams

STANDARD
We're going home. We're

MELKONIS
We're going freezers now.
BROUSSARD
I'm starving;

I think that's pretty reasonable
request.
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM
The entire crew seated table, eating huge portions

Broussard's face screwed mask agony,
trembling violently head foot.
BROUSSARD
(incoherent shriek)
OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!
A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.
THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS
TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A
MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.
Everybody SCREAMS leaps table. The cat spits

The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting Broussard's

scurries away men stampeding safe ground.
When finally regain control themselves, escaped.
Broussard lies slumped chair, huge hole chest,

FAUST
Shit...
STANDARD
We'll catch eject

MELKONIS
(sighs)
Well, I kind hate point

STANDARD
We've got week left, right?
HUNTER
And run food

FAUST
The water recycle.
ROBY
We won't need then.

All right, that's we've got.
A week. It's plenty time.
ROBY
But haven't caught

FAUST
We pressure suits

STANDARD
No, can't afford lose

MELKONIS
How?
STANDARD
Room room, corridor corridor.
No likes thought.
MELKONIS
And it?
STANDARD
We'll trap somehow. If
strong piece net,
bag it.
FAUST
We cut section
metallite netting. It won't hold
acid, aside
it's pretty strong.
ROBY
We avoid injuring it. What
need electric
animal prods.
HUNTER
I think I cobble
together. A long metal rod
battery it. Give hell
shock.
STANDARD
Good. Get it. But first, I'm
issuing standing order:

locker change.
They start exit.
EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE
The SNARK continues way weird vortex hyperspace.
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP
Standard walking purposefully corridor, alone. He

He reaches corner turns. But new passageway different

INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE
Melkonis seated dome, upside-down, peering space.
He wears protective suit.
Standard, upside-down, climbs dome. It dark eerie

STANDARD
I thought I'd here.
MELKONIS
I thinking line old
poem: "Water, water everywhere,
drop drink." All space
there, we're trapped
ship.
STANDARD
That's albatross,
right?
MELKONIS
We can't radio help;
carrier wave wouldn't reach
destination till long we'd
died turned dust. We
utterly, absolutely alone. Can
anybody visualize
scale distances? Halfway
Creation...
STANDARD
We came there, we'll back. A
long time clock, short

MELKONIS
Time space meaning
here. We're living Einsteinian

STANDARD
I you're putting spare

Come -- let's

FAUST
Might incinerate damn

I hope not.
HUNTER
Don't worry, won't damage it,

STANDARD
How locate creature?
FAUST
With these.
He picks small portable unit.

starts beeping.
Standard takes device studies it.
STANDARD
These useful. At
won't digging
closets bare hands. All
right, here's battle plan: we're
going break teams
start systematically covering
ship. Whoever finds first,
catches net ejects
nearest airlock. Clear?
ROBY
Even simple.
Standard shoots vicious look, continues:
STANDARD
For starters, let's sure

Faust takes device turns on. He scans room.
FAUST
It's clear.
STANDARD
All right -- Roby Melkonis
Faust. Hunter I

They start doling equipment.
STANDARD (CONT'D)
We'll carry communicators. We

Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
Needle's spinning dial.
MELKONIS

Faust turns tracker side, needle stabilizes.
FAUST
No, confused. It's coming

They look feet.
INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL
Roby, Melkonis, Faust come carefully set crude metal

They stop foot stairs position, spreading

ROBY
Okay.
FAUST
(looking tracker

That way.
They begin walk passageway, footsteps clanging raw

ROBY
What happened lights?
FAUST
Bulbs burned out, bothered
replace 'em.
They switch helmet lights.
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:
FAUST (CONT'D)
Hold it.
They stop quickly, stumbling.
FAUST (CONT'D)

It's 4 meters.
Roby Melkonis heft net, keeping prod hand. Faust,

Behind plastic mask, sweat pouring Faust's face sets

WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF

Instinctively, throw net it, but:
ROBY
(very annoyed)
Oh, hold it!
They open net release creature. IT IS THE CAT. Hissing
spitting, scampers away.
MELKONIS
We're making fools ourselves!

STANDARD
Once kill thing won't need

Get masks on.
They pull gas masks.
ROBY
This stuff's deadly -- I hope

STANDARD
Go ahead, Jay.
Faust turns machine. It begins throb pumps gas

Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN

Then sounds stop altogether.
STANDARD (CONT'D)
Shut off.
Faust shuts pump.
ROBY
Now what?

MELKONIS
So goes airshaft

HUNTER
Sounds like rough one.
STANDARD
Got better idea?
Hunter shrugs.
ROBY
So question left is:
gets crawl airshaft?
STANDARD
Let's democratic.
He tears small sheets paper pad console. On

tiny little ball.
He rolls paperballs hands tosses table
