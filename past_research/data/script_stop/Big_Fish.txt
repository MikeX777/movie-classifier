Edward ponders best response, settling on...
EDWARD

A half-broken sign lies road. Edward picks up.

laces tied together.
He passes sign reads "Welcome To Spectre!"
EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY

EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT
By light moon, Edward soaks feet

He stares reflection. He smiles.
It's WOMAN emerges far river.
No telling came -- swimming

He SCREAMS night, breath gone.
