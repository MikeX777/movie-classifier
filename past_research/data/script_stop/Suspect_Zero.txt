Revisions - Billy Ray
Director's Shooting Script
November 30, 2001
FADE IN:
...on BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, coming right us.
BEGIN TITLES.
The wave relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell
daytime night simply obscures -
noisily. It sucks, yawns, roars.
Then realize... massive wave darkness actually
RUN-OFF dirty black WATER alongside edge
Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now...
...to concrete, garbage, weeds. END TITLES.
1 EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M. 1
Amongst refuse discarded MILK CARTON, resting
back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" photographed
face that's obscured grime.
Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers...
bed untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows
all. We stay carton...
Then hollow wind gains speed... deep RUMBLE grows
distance, ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts
whips past us.
...as 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, blur
corner frame, 75 pre-dawn darkness.
Then, truck gone, rush air dissipates. The
milk carton, coke cans... lie undisturbed.
A LIGHT RAIN begins fall... grime washes
away milk carton, revealing face. A child. "Have
You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking.
TILT UP... vast flatness Texas' I-35:
concrete forever. In distance, gray highway yields
black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently endless prairie.
A vertical vein LIGHTNING streaks them.
CUT TO:
...a spoon, stirring cup coffee.

2 INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2
(4:30 A.M.)
HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man.
Reads "Rod Reel" magazine. Has SALESMAN'S CASE
side. Around TRUCK-STOP twilight:
Truckers counter, Elvis wall, "Drink Bud!"
mirror. The WORLD SERIES heard RADIO...
DOLLY (O.S.)
Top ya, Hon?
That's DOLLY, waitress, (50, long.) Speck
looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns
article, underlining particular passage.
...until MAN seats himself, suddenly, seat opposite
Speck's. Speck reacts, startled.
SPECK
Jesus...
The MAN's O'RYAN. We PIECES him: eyes,
hands, stain parka...
O'RYAN
What's case?
SPECK
I'm sorry?
O'RYAN
You're lugging case around.
I'm curious.
Speck looks around: plenty tables here.
So guy bothering me???
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
What sell?
SPECK
I'm... restaurant supplies. I didn't
name?
O'RYAN
Must travel lot, huh?
Speck looking Dolly, Manager, anyone...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Whole country, hereabouts?
3.
SPECK
I don't mean rude but--
O'RYAN
How's wife feel it?
That spun things bit. Speck pauses.
SPECK
What?
O'RYAN
She lonely, gone
time. Does she?
SPECK
Look, I...
O'RYAN
Do lonely?
Speck's thrown can't answer.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Ya miss fucking her, Harold?
SPECK
Listen, I don't know
can't--
O'Ryan silences him... holding piece paper. On
DRAWING. The image faces away us. But Speck
rich detail. And eyes wide.
We catch GLIMPSES: The color flesh. A body-part. Looks like
rendering young, naked WOMAN.
And, like that, Speck finds STARING. Glued.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Did myself. It's sort hobby.
(no reply)
I've got more. Would like
them?
O'Ryan lowers slides SECOND DRAWING over... Speck
speechless, transfixed. Can't look away.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Tell me: jokes traveling
salesman farmer's daughter -
true?
(MORE)
4.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(Speck remains silent)
Here. This one's favorite.
O'Ryan slides DRAWING #3. Again, don't it.
And haven't seen O'Ryan's face.
But Speck, reaction. Utter horror. In fact
recoils violently coffee spills.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Really says all, wouldn't agree?
SPECK
You're a... You're sick.
O'RYAN
That's matter opinion.
SPECK
You're sick!
He rises, leaving drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM
crosses diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches Manager,
(MEL, balding, 50, mood) register.
MEL
Mmm-hmm?
SPECK
I'm having problem -
customer. I'd like ask
leave, please.
MEL
What kind problem?
SPECK
He's--
He turns, point O'Ryan.
...but booth, suddenly, empty. The guy simply
disappeared, taking drawings him.
Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.
CUT TO:
5.
3 EXT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 3
Speck hurries Buick, checking shoulder
repeatedly. Gets car, fumbles keys. They fall
asphalt. He grabs them, opens door.
CUT TO:
4 INT. SPECK'S CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER 4
Speck guns Buick. Interstate 35 flies by. The farther
gets away Diner, happier he'll be.
...until strange SOUND gets attention: it's WIND,
whistling ghost town. Hollow, varied - building
falling again. Wind.
Trouble is, windows Buick up.
Yet again: thin, hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND,
whistling shoulder. He's heard -
Western watched kid.
But wind coming back-seat.
The blood drains right Speck's face. Doesn't know
jam brakes drive faster.
He looks rear-view, catches glimpse LATEX GLOVE
snapping hand. Dear God: O'Ryan there, making
odd Ghost-Town wind sound. Whistling.
SPECK
(sheer terror)
What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-
me?!
No reply. Instead, gift appears back:
FOURTH DRAWING, tossed darkness Speck's lap.
He looks down, registers image... SHRIEKS.
O'RYAN (O.S.)
There's rest stop, off-ramp. Pull
it.
SPECK
I money. It's lot but--
O'RYAN
Nobody wants money, Harold. Just
pull in.
6.
SPECK
Why?!
O'Ryan rises frame now, like Nosferatu...
O'RYAN
Because I don't wanna 70 miles
hour. It dangerous.
Speck finds off-ramp. His breaths shallow now.
SPECK
Please, Mister - want
me?
O'Ryan's face: knowing grin fans it...
CUT TO:
...the face VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, bulletin board.
5 INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME 5
DAY)
We're looking F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey
#7 it. He's 40, white. His crime listed rape,
murder, kidnapping.
THOMAS MACKELWAY stares Starkey's image. At eyes...
Mackelway 34, bred success - bred stardom fact,
whiz he's attempted.
So hell Wichita Falls, Texas...?
EIGHT AGENTS, cubicles, ring outer offices. Quiet
phones, lousy take-out options, hardly dream gig.
CHARLTON (O.S.)
Got spot set you, Tom.
That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly.
Charlton heads corner. Mackelway follows.
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
Ms. Potter's nice girl met
desk. She puts package
new agents, things know
area, help finding apartments
such. This one's yours:
Charlton stops CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A
corner dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread.
7.
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
Not different Dallas, it?
MACKELWAY
(fuck yes)
No, Sir.
CHARLTON
Good.
An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells World Series,
mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws
briefcase desk, setting world:
A framed picture BROTHER, ages 10 15,
childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer,
calendar, baseball covered autographs.
He opens drawer, casually tosses bottles
BUFFERIN it.
...but grabs tablets bottles,
throws throat, as:
GRIEVES (O.S.)
Ya like Frito Pies?
Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding white
grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves Mackelway's age,
ambitious. But solid, decent.
MACKELWAY
I dunno. What they?
Grieves pulls greasy concoction that's wrapped like
semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses Mackelway:
GRIEVES
Welcome minors.
Grieves passes faint smile, handing lunch
agents. Mackelway eyes still-wrapped Frito Pie.
God, outta here...
CUT TO:
6 INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER 6
A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, cubicle, watching THOSE
OTHER AGENTS calls, strap guns, head
assignment. Men motion.
8.
But Mackelway's land-locked, writing Auto-Theft report.
It's drudgery, he's meticulous it, deleting word
"beige" replacing "tan."
His head throbbing - unusual circumstance him.
But lingering half-second "Most-Wanted
List" again? Starkey? It's wound...
7 INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER 7
Mackelway struggles COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar
him. Filter, water, grounds, etc.
KATIE (O.S.)
Here. Lemme that.
He turns. This KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under-
challenged job. Been years. In seconds
she's got thing percolating. Of course.
KATIE (CONT'D)
It takes experience.
He shrugs, feeling smooth.
KATIE (CONT'D)
You're Mackelway, right?
MACKELWAY
Mmm-hmm.
KATIE
Fax came you. It's room
door.
MACKELWAY
Oh. Thanks.
He rises, heads "fax room"...
8 INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING 8
A closet, converted useful space. FIVE FAX
MACHINES sit stands, sharing surge protector. One fax
machine printing. Mackelway approaches it.
Six pieces paper await him. The TOP-SHEET,
written hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI
Resident Agency - Wichita Falls." No sender named.
He looks beneath sheet - Page One fax.
9.
A young BOY stares him, face photostatically
copied. Across top, also-handwritten: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"
At sheet, typed, read:
"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn.
Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date Disappearance: 10-16-99."
Mackelway eyes face, vitals. No idea
sent him. Then looks Page Two.
A young WOMAN stares time. Another faxed
photo. Another "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" scrawled
it. And, sheet:
"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk.
Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date Disappearance: 5-6-00."
The faxes same: Pictures
vitals. Faces. Facts. "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"
He looks transmissions, finds fax
number sender. Dials it. All hears loud
grainy shriek dedicated fax line.
He eyes faxes again. It's alarming, it's odd. Then
Charlton emerges office, shouting:
CHARLTON
Mackelway! You gonna sit ass
day, wanna something?
Mackelway's room instant.
CUT TO:
9 EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY 9
Your standard roadside rest-stop: parking lot weeds
poking bathrooms wouldn't near. Those
STORMCLOUDS saw earlier CLOSER now...
POLICE CARS HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES site.
Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He Mackelway out.
Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; deputy, BUD
GRANGER, gangly, baby-faced pup.
DYLAN
Afternoon, Rick.
(Charlton nods)
Looks like robbery/homicide. Body's
way.
10.
He gestures ravine, TOW TRUCK currently
lowering winch abandoned vehicle.
It Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down ravine, teetering
rock, like balanced scales justice.
MACKELWAY
Ya run plates?
Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot." Mackelway nods,
reminding remember new rank. Dylan hands
preliminary report Charlton.
DYLAN
Fella's Harold Speck. Traveling
salesman, Abilene.
Charlton eyes report, hands Mackelway. The
hierarchy clear. Very.
Mackelway turns: ravine runs right SIGN
reads "Welcome Texas" "You leaving
Oklahoma" other.
A vehicle, left right state-line. Odd...
Then, NOISE: Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's
yank Buick ditch.
MACKELWAY
(it blurts out)
Hey!
Before Charlton react, Mackelway running
weed-choked lot, zeroing TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.
10 EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING 10
The Driver, JUMBO, operating winch hydraulic
handle truck. Mackelway barrels in:
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
What fuck're doing?!
JUMBO
What's look like, Bud?
Mackelway reaches past Jumbo hits "Stop" button
himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful
LOCAL COPS stand atop ravine, watching.
11.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
You guys heard evidentiary
procedure?
No replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens,
expecting reprimand overstepping bounds.
MACKWELWAY (CONT'D)
Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.
Charlton eyes car. Then Mackelway.
CHARLTON
Did right thing, Agent Mackelway.
Let's look.
Charlton starts embankment. Mackelway doesn't,
hanging eyes TRACKS Buick
tumbling. Something them...
He pulls small CAMERA pocket, Minox. Snaps
photos scene - Buick, ravine, tracks,
FOOTPRINTS alongside them.
Then heads 15-foot embankment.
11 EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING 11
It's ugly sight. Speck inches us, head
facing direction, twisted unnaturally.
Mackelway kneels open window, pulls
gloves, puts on. He lean car,
breathe it, caution evidence obvious.
CHARLTON (O.S.)
What's that?
Charlton opposite him, outside passenger-side window,
pointing DRAWING O'Ryan tossed Speck's
lap. It lies face seat.
But something's FINGER-PAINTED it: A
RED CIRCLE, SLASH it.
Charlton begins reach it, when:
MACKELWAY
(to stop him)
Sir?
Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves."
12.
Charlton eyes him. It's irritating corrected guy
outrank, especially he's right.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Sort a... stickler procedure.
CHARLTON
I imagine be.
That jab, don't know yet. Charlton puts
gloves. Mackelway snaps shots Minox,
looking rest car, as:
GRANGER
(aloud)
Hey Jumbo. Toss crowbar.
Granger's trunk. Before Mackelway comment, Jumbo
tossed CROWBAR embankment:
ten-pound hunk iron, flying right us.
Everybody ducks... CLANGS roof Buick.
Jumbo shrugs.
JUMBO
You said toss it.
Mackelway shakes head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs
crowbar. He's open trunk as:
MACKELWAY
Hold second.
Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses trunk, snaps
shots Minox.
Something catches eye, line TRUNK. He
kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty hard, formed
line paint single post.
He takes VIAL, scrapes residue it.
Then sniffs it. Pauses...
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Smells like... clove.
He looks Granger: open trunk.
DYLAN
(re: Mackelway)
Where hell'd guy?
13.
CHARLTON
Field Office. Dallas.
DYLAN
(impressed)
Well now...
(Charlton shrugs)
So hell's doin' here?
That left unanswered. Granger opens trunk.
Mackelway look inside...
There, restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-
shakers, ketchup dispensers, short-order wheel... And
fishing reel, tackle-box, kid's bicycle helmet.
Mackelway eyes all, instincts tell there's
significant here. So returns Speck's body.
He leans in, lifts Speck's head inches away
steering wheel. Gently.
...which learn Speck's EYELIDS torn
off. It's gruesome, Mackelway notes calmly. Charlton
leans in, gets look.
CHARLTON
Christ...
Mackelway expressionless. But LIDLESS
EYES draws closer. He leans in, BAM! We rocketed
series dark, disjointed images:
12 EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT 12
Seems like we're standing field TALL WHEAT; can't
sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.
A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone fired gun. We slump hard
ground. Then look up.
Mackelway stands us, face wet rain. Then,
quickly, IMAGES VANISH are:
13 INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY 13
We start EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve pad
paper, DESK. Scrawled pad WAVY LINE. He holds
tip pen it, seconds,
expecting kind pulse it.
Here come IMAGES again: wet wheat, muzzle flash,
Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then cease...
14.
...and O'Ryan begins DRAW, hurriedly. Only half face
visible us, tell concentration
total.
His pen continues furious work, spasm activity,
SOUNDS vision bleed in: gun-shot, rain,
wind. They're alive O'Ryan's mind...
And DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field,
gun, Mackelway.
Then, pen set down. The drawing complete.
O'Ryan eyes calmly, checks watch, jotting
exact time date drawing. Then slips
folder marked, "MACKELWAY."
CUT TO:
14 EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY 14
Picket fence, swing porch, lawn needs mowing.
A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, bringing food... tissues
into.
15 INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY) 15
Shocked faces. Food unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN,
40 frayed - sits chair, immobile. FRIENDS FAMILY
about, tending her.
KIDS hover. Two them, 4-YEAR-OLD BOY 8-YEAR-OLD
GIRL, sniff tears people offer condolences.
But focus Jan - grief. She's shaking...
O'RYAN (O.S.)
Mrs. Speck?
She looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, eye-level,
faces here. Jan half-nods.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Just wanted offer condolences.

I didn't know but... I think
Harold complex man
people realized.
Jan raw Speck touches now.
15.
JAN
(through tears)
He was, wasn't he?
O'RYAN
I'm sorry loss, ma'am.
She sniffs tear, thanks smile. O'Ryan
extends hand her. She takes it. He moves off.
Beside FRAMED PORTRAIT Speck. We blow past it,
BLACK CREPE adorning corner
portrait's FRAME, and:
BAM! We're rocketed set odd IMAGES again:
16 EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME 16
This time, blur gray. We hear
wet wind. We hear heavy BREATHING,
running somewhere... VOICE, rising wind,
saying:
(O.S.)
Please...
The sound echoes oddly, bouncing satellite
somewhere, distance time space.
Then sound soupy grayness VANISH. This vision
ended. When pop it, we're TIGHT Mackelway...
CUT TO:
17 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17
Mackelway sits wheel Chevy Yukon, parked

Mackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds hands.
MACKELWAY

CHARLTON
Okay. Whadda know?
FRAN
Picked foot-print seat

Speck's.
Just like that, Fran piping up. Mackelway's unoffended.
17.
CHARLTON

FRAN
Wounds Speck's throat indicate

She slides FOURTH DRAWING Charlton - giving
look it.
INSERT - THE DRAWING:

ZIPLOC BAGS. Inside bags BODY PARTS.
It's realized accurately looks like

Charlton eyes reaction.
FRAN (CONT'D)
Lab picked talcum traces edges

Plausible enough, until:
MACKELWAY
I don't think so, no. I think
pushed.
FRAN
How ya figure?
MACKELWAY
The look tracks. Foot-prints near
embankment.
Without embellishing further, slides
PHOTOGRAPHS took morning Minox: tire-
tracks, foot-prints. She eyes them.
Then eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes tension.
18.
CHARLTON
Okay. So guy likes draw pictures
body parts spring 'em
people. What's us?
(they're silent)
That's I thought.
There plenty going unsaid Mackelway Fran.
Charlton time it.
CHARLTON
Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came you:
He tosses 9-by-12 ENVELOPE Mackelway, opens it. Six
sheets paper slide out.
First TOP SHEET FAX: hand-written
inscription one: "Attention, Agent Thomas
Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls."
Okay. This twice now. He knows
sheet looking. But here's Page One:
A photo middle-aged African-American WOMAN. Across

And typed bottom: "Tanya Green. Age 42. Ht. 5'9", Wt.
165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Ames, Iowa. Date

The following sheets bring faces: men, women,
young, old. Four HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.
But think through, hears:
MANAGER (O.S.)

They turn. That came NIGHT MANAGER: humorless guy
named LES. He's looking door, Dolly
entered. Pink cowboy boots tonight.
DOLLY

MACKELWAY

MEL

Harold came up, complainin' guy

They stop short, waiting yield. Finally
Mackelway nods, "Go ahead."
FRAN

DOLLY

Dolly pauses, face scrunching bit. Troubled...
DOLLY (CONT'D)
That's weird. Guy better

She shrugs apologetically.

MACKELWAY
We ought work kind

FRAN
For what?
MACKELWAY
Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty
silly, talking another.
FRAN
Fine. I'll handle on.
He doesn't argue. They come stop Bonneville,
stripped primer. Time work...
Two agents, instinct. We study things, details,
minds churning... Mackelway pulls Minox,
snaps shots. Then:
MACKELWAY
Trunk's ajar.
She turns. Sure enough, Bonneville's trunk ajar.
Mackelway approaches, cautiously.
He doesn't gloves him, uses jacket pocket
protect prints. He opens trunk.
First thing sees SYMBOL again: circle-with-a-
slash-through-it... staring right him.
21.
But time, it's carved somebody's back.
Mackelway stares. So Fran. Before lies body,
stripped waist: chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead.
Mackelway sighs. Things got tougher...
CUT TO:
22 INT. ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY 22
Harold Speck lies table. A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines
him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies another, ample
frame examined.
The lights out, Coroner wears FLUORESCENT HALO,
MICROPHONE pinned gown. He speaks
quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc.
Mackelway Fran here... watching. Mackelway
particularly focused Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS,
see, torn off. Hmmmm...
FRAN
Why eyelids?
MACKELWAY
Huh?
FRAN
No signs torture here. Why
somebody's eyelids off?
MACKELWAY
So can't blink.
She sighs, aloud: "I know already, Asshole." Coroner
keeps head down, speaking microphone.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
It's metaphor - certain
victim sees... certain
something.
(she's silent)
Or maybe it's fuck-you.
Coroner continues monotone narration... crosses
sink.
That puts earshot. So:
22.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(to Fran, quietly)
I'm sorry Don.
FRAN
(thrown)
Huh?
MACKELWAY
You're wearing ring anymore.
That attempt kindness. She knows that. Still,
eyes left hand, self-consciously, Mackelway loses
lidless eyes Fulcher's...
Then there's KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM.
They turn. Charlton stands GLASS
WINDOW, VIEWING ROOM adjacent Morgue. He presses
piece paper glass.
On it, typed bold letters top, read: "MATCHES
ONE OF ONE." Below Circle-with-the-slash-
through-it.
This FAX, Charlton's received. He points
fax look like little squiggles
first, discover hand drawn street
map.
The ink bleeds bit poor fax transmission. Those
scrawled lines "The Hope House," Oklahoma City.
At scribbled name, "David Dyson," contact

Moving closer glass, Mackelway nods. He got
break...
CUT TO:
23 INT. GRAMMAR-SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - BOULDER, CO. - DAY 23
A CHOIR FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS stands school

Everybody's weeping. A framed picture Barney Fulcher sits

In back, TOWNSFOLK gathered

CUT TO:
24 EXT. "HOPE HOUSE" - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT 24
A three-story Victorian residence decay, door
CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN middle Oklahoma City's Skid Row.
Rain falls. The street still.
Mackelway approaches halfway-house. A lights shine

strident, off-key voice somebody singing.
25 EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING 25
The door open. Through SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway
old-fashioned "foyer." He knocks. Waits.
Two sounds dominate: buzz tv, strident

But one's coming answer door, it's wide open
anyway... So Mackelway enters.
MACKELWAY
Hello?
26 INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING 26
TV room left. There, single 35 year-old DRUNK/
TRANSIENT (we'll "PIPER") sits, watching "Behind
Music" VH1. Tonight's subject? Leif Garret...
Piper doesn't look up, acknowledge Mackelway all. Rather
INCREASES THE TV VOLUME drown singing upstairs,
intentionally off-key.
Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. Posters
fliers walls. 10 BEDROOMS upstairs.
DYSON (O.S.)
Agent Mackelway?
Mackelway turns. Descending creaking stairway DAVID
DYSON: 50, lean, friendly smile.
CUT TO:

27 INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER 27
We staring BASEMENT WALL covered, floor
ceiling, 1,000 identical renderings
symbol: CIRCLE-WITH-A-SLASH-THROUGH-IT.
1,000 them, bright red paint, pitch black
enamel. Only machine achieved kind
repetition. Or maniac.
This basement leaky, drafty, poorly lit. But it's
quiet: sound awful singing upstairs MUTED
basement door rain itself.
DYSON
Benjamin spent hours here.
Mackelway takes in, corner basement. He
notes row standing GYM LOCKERS.
MACKELWAY
(re: lockers)
Did access those?
DYSON
No. They're staff-only.
MACKELWAY
Would mind opening me?
Dyson shrugs; thinks it's waste time - he'll
it. Mackelway follows dank room.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
He here... seven years said?
DYSON
Off on. It's uncommon
guests vanish months time.
Dyson works combination lock locker.
MACKELWAY
I ran database,
sure. There's Agent
Benjamin O'Ryan Bureau.
DYSON
No... elaborate fantasies go,
favorites.
(fondly)
And it.
25.
Dyson half-chuckles; liked guy... He throws open
locker. Inside, nothing. Mackelway indicates
locker. Dyson works combination.
MACKELWAY
Is called him? Benjamin?
DYSON
It's wished called.
Locker #2 opened - empty. Only locker left.
DYSON (CONT'D)
(re: locker #3)
That one's mine.
Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, opened." Dyson sighs,
works combination. Mackelway waits.
Locker #3 opened. Inside, incriminating: sweater,
old junk, trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Mackelway
nods. Dyson shuts locker.
Mackelway looks wall: 1,000 copies circle-with-
a-slash-through-it. No idea signify...
DYSON (CONT'D)
He painted walls room,
too.
MACKELWAY
Can I it?
DYSON
We've painted over.
MACKELWAY
Still, helpful.
Dyson heads stairs. They're wooden slats
basement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, old
vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture.
Mackelway follows. They climb...
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Wait.
They stop. Something caught Mackelway's eye, visible
beneath stairs: BOX, bucket PAINT sticking
it...
26.
28 INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING 28
Mackelway climbs stairs, crouching down, pushing
aside aforementioned junk. He grabs box.
Sure enough, bucket held red paint - color
O'Ryan cover wall. There's bucket BLACK
PAINT here. And brushes.
Mackelway brings box meager light. We look
INSIDE IT now. So Dyson.
Inside, beneath paint-buckets, TV GUIDES,
yo-yo, football. Then BOOK TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE.
Mackelway grabs it, eyes it.
He flips pages - odd images: TRIBESMAN
eyes rolling head, strange rites, etc.
Mackelway sets book down. Then, amidst materials
box, spots large folded MAP.
He grabs it, begins unfold it. We map's
written on, pen. Cities CIRCLED.
But good look it, Mackelway spots
else, box, shocker:
A photograph himself.
It takes second realize he's looking at. But
is, NEWSPAPER PHOTO, Agent Thomas Mackelway.
It FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July year,
concerning trial release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7
F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List...
Dyson can't help notice picture Mackelway.
Mackelway stares. Suddenly JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS,
brief, choppy FLASHBACK.

29 EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK
We're RUNNING, dashing buildings chipped-adobe,
hearing sound breathing
thuds heavy feet.
This Matamoros, Mexico, shit-hole border town.
Squalor sin. We DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: "This
place," sticks palm.
27.
30 INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 30
Mackelway stares newspaper: Starkey - rapist,
murderer, case thrown court - stunning
failure involved.
...as RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again...
31 INT. "CLUB" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK 31
Bad-lighting, drunk patrons CIRCLE, DONKEY-SHOW
taking place bare stage. Feels like we've stepped
kind evil carnival. It's dizzying.
Among crowd: Virgil Starkey, ugly drunken binge,
guy isn't cheering laughing.
Suddenly GUN pointed right head.
Starkey freezes, caught. Some PATRONS
stand... But goes on.
32 INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 32
That ARTICLE gives now, reason Starkey's
case thrown court. It this:
The F.B.I. Agent case mistake
"evidentiary procedure." Hence, Mackelway's picture.
On face, GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: months ago.
33 INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK 33
Three months passed arrest Matamoros. Now
Mackelway sits courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent
courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him.
PROSECUTOR #1

MACKELWAY
Yes, Sir.
PROSECUTOR #1
Leaving tissue sample care
Mexican lab? Are fucking kidding me?
MACKELWAY
They assured understood

PROSECUTOR #1
Well guess what? They didn't. And
prick's gonna walk, murders not.
That registered.
34 INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 34
Beneath newspaper article OTHER ARTICLES,
concerning Starkey: crimes, capture, it.
Mackelway's memory got stoked again:
35 INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK 35
Mackelway emerges courthouse anteroom, whipped.
The hall's busy MEDIA traffic. First face
sees Fran, sits bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes
lousy feels him. It helps.
36 INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK 36
The door bursts open Mackelway storms in. No need look
composed now; he's here. He crosses paper-towel
dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares mirror.
He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - barely look
reflection.
Then hears LAUGHTER, him. He turns.
Out darkness badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey
emerges, coming view single light.
Beside GRIM COP, chaperone. Starkey passes
Mackelway, snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts
eyes tight. His head pounding. END FLASHBACK.
37 INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING 37
Mackelway stares... record deepest wound. But
hell locker transient?
CUT TO:
38 INT. HOPE HOUSE - "O'RYAN'S ROOM" - MOMENTS LATER 38
Mackelway leans in, looking around. A bed. A small end-table.
Bathroom. A window bars.
29.
From hall hear sound PHONE RINGING,
FAX transmission. An old fax machine begins whine
noisily, creaking. It's distraction.
But Mackelway's focus room. The walls newly
painted. But there's hint barely-perceptible color
beneath them. Rain LEAKY ROOF causing
new paint peel bit.
A BUCKET collects drops center room. The feeling
damp, mildewy, creepy. Mackelway remains
doorway... backs out.
DYSON (O.S.)
I guess fellas're unaccounted
for, huh?
39 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUING 39
Mackelway turns, bit startled. Dyson approaching, FAX
hand.
MACKELWAY
Huh?
Dyson extends pages. On TOP-SHEET, written hand,
words: "Agent Thomas Mackelway, C/O Mr. David Dyson,
Hope House" street address.
And sheet? Five pages.
Mackelway sighs, takes Dyson. Sure enough, he's
staring faces, fact sheets. Five
HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.
But know send here?
DYSON
Anything urgent?
MACKELWAY
(doesn't look up)
No.
Dyson glad hear it.
CUT TO:
40 INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 40
Mackelway descends, having place.
Piper left him, watching VH1 TV Room.
30.
Mackelway passes, eyeing newly-faxed pages:
HAVE YOU SEEN ME'S... He reaches door.
PIPER
Ever seen fifty-foot shark?
Mackelway stops, turns.
MACKELWAY
I'm sorry?
PIPER
Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?
MACKELWAY
No.
PIPER
Doesn't mean aren't any.
Great. Mackelway reaches door again. Then
halts. Maybe guy helpful. Mackelway turns:
MACKELWAY
Did know him?
(Piper's silent)
The guy stay upstairs.
"O'Ryan." Did know him?
PIPER
Why? Is dead?
MACKELWAY
I don't...
PIPER
You said "Did." Is dead?
MACKELWAY
Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's dead...
(a beat)
You know him?
Piper nods.
Mackelway eyes him, approaches, holding copy
image: circle-with-slash-through-it.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
He talk this? A circle
slash it?
31.
Piper rises, crosses us... leaning unnecessarily close.
It's unsettling.
PIPER
That's circle. It's zero.
MACKELWAY
Oh. How know?
Piper doesn't answer. Instead simply starts whistling.
But it's tune coming mouth. It's
sound O'Ryan made: A WHISTLING WIND, blowing
ghost town... Building, falling again.
Piper smiles, backing away, enjoying theatricality it,
stifling giggle...
Then, suddenly, turns GRAINY, CHOPPY...
We've jumped distorted, REMOTE POV scene -
watching crystal ball, broken lens,
distance time space...
We images, fragments: Piper, tv, sofa, Mackelway's
face. Then sound breaks up, are...
41 INT. MOTEL ROOM - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING 41
Start O'Ryan's EYES. Then pad paper. The spasm
pen, scrawling LIST it: "Piper. TV. Whistling." We're
non-descript MOTEL ROOM. $29 night.
He holds point pen wavy line
list words, keeping seconds,
expecting receive kind pulse it.
No pulse. He lost "connection"
transported him. He notes watch. Jots exact time.
Slips pad FOLDER: "Mackelway."
Then starts DRAW - hurried accurate sketch
Mackelway Piper, stood
conversation. The geography fairly accurate.
O'Ryan continues draw. We CRANE OUT motel room,
find, street below:
42 EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING 42
A typical honky-tonk town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just

43 INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING 43
Low-lights, dust floor. Pool tables.
LORETTA pretty 19-year-old stands jukebox,
weighing choices. She's got curtain hair,
wrangles CHIP-CLIP. It's habit.
She chooses country-rock tune, heads bar,
walking beat. It's fun 19 beautiful.
44 AT THE BAR - CONTINUING 44
The BARTENDER'S stocky guy broad smile.
LORETTA

How's that?
BARTENDER
Little cute taste, I stand

LORETTA

BARTENDER

She half-laughs, hasn't carded decade,
throws curtain hair other, re-

LORETTA
It's car. No one's asked
couple years now.
BARTENDER
If ya hurry, you'll catch end
song.
She eyes him: carding me? He smiles:
personal, Sugar. So heads door.
...on way, passes booth. In familiar
face - Virgil Ray Starkey...
He remains still, hadn't noticed her. But
eyes, primal took place. He rises, heads
door.
33.
45 EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER 45
Loretta walks VW Bug. Starkey exits bar. She
doesn't notice. We TILT UP: lights O'Ryan's
motel room...
46 EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 46
It happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits ground
open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away,
kicking gravel.
CUT TO:
...Loretta's eyes, wide terror dread.
47 INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER 47
We're off-road. Missouri's woods seen
windshield. And Starkey staring us. Pawing us...
LORETTA
Please, Mister...
Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head
window, hard. That makes things start swim. Starkey tears
clothes, lowers her.
She whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO:
48 INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME 48
This you've moved Wichita Falls
money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen
table, scuffed blinds.
...and sleepless agent, having lousy night.
Mackelway sits edge bed, able hear
Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights like this. His head
POUNDING again. Down Bufferin.
Above him, covering bedroom mirror, MAP took
Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED.
It's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring mirror.
As glimpsed basement, map
written on, pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it:
Over THUSAND CITIES CIRCLED, hand,
RED. Each circled cities DATE written
it, red: ("4/6," "5/19," "10-26," etc.)
34.
Mackelway studies it, face working. Another
WHIMPERS Loretta hang, suspended. Mackelway
shakes off, certain he's imagining it.
He won't sleep wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to:
49 INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING 49
The attack continues, terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs.
It hurts. Starkey's powerful fight off. We stay
face: dazed, mind simply checking out.
...until look cognizance comes her, brought
SHADOW passed by.
Then window Starkey simply EXPLODES.
Glass flies everywhere, TWO ARMS reach pick-up.
They grab Starkey neck yank pick-up,
sliced open shards. He screams.
She can't resist coming window, sees:
50 EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING 50
Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing

HUNTING KNIFE extends hand.
But tone, great surprise, conversational:
O'RYAN
Hey, listen, I'm sorta new town. Ya
know I good donkey show?
Starkey idea respond maniac:
STARKEY
Huh?
O'RYAN
Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America
animals rights.
(pointedly)
Don't they, Virgil?
STARKEY
How fuck I know?
O'Ryan half-smiles, kicks Starkey right head.
Loretta's eyes wide. Another kick follows, ribs.
Then groin. Then:
35.
O'RYAN
(at Loretta)
Turn around.
He said looking her. But tell
hasn't moved - frightened. So eyes her.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(again)
Turn around!
She turns away, lying face seat, covering
head. No idea kind terror come next. We STAY
WITH HER... able hear follows:
The sound animal, awful - like pig gutted -
horrible SQUEAL, covering GRUNTS coming O'Ryan.
In goes knife again, prompting agonized
Starkey. Loretta's crying too: fear, shock... She keeps
face buried, shutting eyes tight. The sounds
savagery night.
Then, gasp Starkey... followed awful
silence... assault over.
Loretta's afraid look - certain maniac
knife coming next.
But hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away. So rises,
peeking edge window. WE STAY ON HER FACE,
sees what's attacker.
Her horrified SCREAM fills woods...
51 INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - RESUMING 51
Mackelway STARES window; like HEARD
scream. Of course, that'd impossible. He looks map.
His PHONE RINGS. He eyes it, unsurprised...
CUT TO:
52 EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE SLEEPER, MO. - LATER 52
Law enforcement VEHICLES surround site. COPS, Grieves,
CORONER'S GUYS taking pictures. Loretta sitting
ambulance, tended to.
A COMPOSITE ARTIST sits her, trying.
LORETTA
I don't think eyes right.
36.
COMPOSITE ARTIST
Narrower?
LORETTA
No, were... I don't know.
Composite Artist keeps trying, attempt doesn't look
like face O'Ryan.
Charlton, meanwhile, stands body, mind racing.
A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps
it. We follow takes scene.
A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; got zero-with-
a-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen guy's face
yet.
MACKELWAY
Sir?
(Charlton turns)
We got i.d. yet?
CHARLTON
Mmm-hmm.
(Mackelway waits)
Might wanna fender.
You're gonna need sit down.
(Mackelway's waiting)
It's Virgil Ray Starkey.
Mackelway pales.
We stay moment registers. The man
caught, lost, killed again. No. God, no.
MACKELWAY
(struggling composure:)
Starkey this?
CHARLTON
No. Starkey's ground.
Mackelway pauses, thinks must've heard wrong. But turns
face, ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing
image darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped
away.
Mackelway stares, stunned. Can't fucking believe it.
MACKELWAY
(breathless)
My God...
37.
It's like looking ghost - spectre that's haunting
him, dead now... Mackelway pulls Minox, starts
photographing, moving LIDLESS EYES...
GRIEVES
Gonna wallet-size one?
CHARLTON
Give break, Grieves.
Mackelway doesn't comment. Just keeps snapping shots...
CUT TO:
53 INT. FBI OFFICE - MACKELWAY'S CUBICLE - MORNING 53
The number HAVE YOU SEEN ME's grown, bit.
45 PAGES sit stacked Mackelway's desk. 45 victims. He grabs
stack, rises.
Heading Conference Room, nearly bumps Katie,
Receptionist, rounding corner.
MACKELWAY
'Scuse me.
She smiles. He carries HAVE YOU SEEN ME's into:
54 INT. FBI OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUING 54
A room dedicated solely murders. On
erasure board words: The "O'Ryan" Room.
On wall MAP Mackelway took Hope House:
thousand CITIES circled O'Ryan himself.
Mackelway puts stack HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Picks
box YELLOW STICK-PINS, affixing map -
faxed face.
Here's "Jason Corey, Age 14." Last seen "Riverside, Ca."
"10-16-99."
Sure enough, O'Ryan circled "Riverside, Ca." map.
Next he'd written "10-16."
Mackelway sticks yellow pin Riverside.
Next, fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22." Last Seen?
"Macon, Ga." "5-6-00."
Of course, O'Ryan circled "Macon" too. Beside he'd
written "5-6." So Macon gets yellow pin.
38.
Mackelway continues, as:
FRAN (O.S.)
Got fax.
Mackelway turns. In comes Fran.
FRAN (CONT'D)
Came business center Mariott
Dallas. Nobody saw sent it.
Mackelway nods. Then turn... Charlton enters
room.
CHARLTON
Whadda know map?
MACKELWAY
It matches faxes, Sir. Almost
perfectly.
Charlton approaches map: 1,242 cities, circled red.
Mackelway continues yellow pins: HAVE
YOU SEEN ME? (45 far.)
Charlton eyes stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then
map: 1,242 cities. Each DATE it.
CHARLTON
Why's Greenville blue?
(Mackelway yellow pin dozen cities...
tiny Greenville, Texas BLUE PIN it.)
MACKELWAY
Only city date fax
date map didn't correspond.
He pulls fax stack: Korean boy named "Steven
Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date Disappearance:
8-7-98."
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Fax lists date disappearance
August 7. On map he's written "10-
26."
The DATE O'Ryan's map reads "10-26" Greenville, Tx.
So Greenville gets blue pin map.
Charlton notes today's date: October 17...
39.
CHARLTON
Any bodies recovered?
MACKELWAY
Two far. Female, disappeared
Dayton, Ohio April 12. And male,
Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.
On MAP, Dayton's got "4/12" written it. Trenton
"1/5." Both yellow pins them.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
But bodies
thousand miles they'd
seen. One Montana,
Oregon. Got autopsy reports both.
Charlton looks table, AUTOPSY REPORTS AUTOPSY
PHOTOS sit - victims we've seen before.
We VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist
above, waist below. Charlton gives photos cursory
glance, more.
But notice something, bodies: male
Trenton - odd BURN MARK lower left calf.
Looks symmetrical, horizontal calf...
CHARLTON
Either bodies zero
them?
MACKELWAY
No, Sir.
Charlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We
look MAP, handful yellow pins it...
DISSOLVE TO:
...that map, HUNDRED YELLOW PINS now.
55 INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - NIGHT 55
It's 8:30 night. Mackelway - staring
map. He's lot lately.
The stack HAVE YOU SEEN ME's grown well. Every

40.
(Some HAVE YOU SEEN ME's arrived U.S. MAIL. We
stack ENVELOPES box, sealed PLASTIC,
stamped addressed Mackelway.)
Mackelway eyes map, puzzling. Fran's right him.
Assorted papers leads room, including photos
took Minox.
FRAN
Why you?
MACKELWAY
Huh?
FRAN
He sending agent
office country... But he's
sending you. Why?
Mackelway's asking question lately.
MACKELWAY
I don't know.
PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.
FRAN (INTO PHONE)
This Agent Kulok.
(a beat)
Who's calling?
She hears answer, covers phone.
FRAN (CONT'D)
(to Mackelway:)
Do know professor named Daitz? Says
he's Tulane.
MACKELWAY
(eagerly)
Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've trading e-

She hands phone...
CUT TO:

56 EXT. TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 56
A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In center lies vast,
expensive structure - Behavioral Sciences Building. The
place goes forever.
57 INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME 57
Mackelway exits elevator "B-1 Level." Corridors
octopus way elevators, confusing us...
58 INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 58
Every door looks same. Mackelway follows numbers -
can't believe long hallways are. Turns corner.
Air heard, moving corridor. But
right number, last.
A tiny CARD fastened wall reads, "Dr. Emile Daitz,
Professor Emeritus, Criminal Psychology." It lists
office hours. Mackelway knocks door.
MACKELWAY
Professor Daitz?
O'RYAN (O.S.)
Yes?
Mackelway opens door. Looks inside.
Here sits O'Ryan, looking like tweedy professor
look. He rises, smiles warmly.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Agent Mackelway. Come in...
CUT TO:
59 INT. DAITZ' OFFICE - LATER NIGHT 59
A tiny, cramped hovel. Books, papers, jammed
overflowing. Mackelway sits O'Ryan...
O'RYAN
(as "Daitz:")
...The theory "Suspect
Zero."
(Mackelway nods)
The idea Suspect Zero posits
serial killer diabolical enough,
traverse country
caught, killing randomly.
42.
There's COLLECTION glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS -
crude knives, swords, blow-darts. Mackelway notes them.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Tell me, makes killer catchable?
MACKELWAY
Patterns, repetition behavior.
O'RYAN
Now imagine killer patterns,
tell-tale fetishes, rituals, hidden
desire caught. A perfect vessel
evil, killing leaving
single meaningful clue wake...
He'd immune capture, wouldn't he?
Your task forces, forensics teams -
they'd helpless.
Mackelway looks Daitz' bookshelf: volume volume
evil, devil, minds sociopaths, history
serial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...
MACKELWAY
Is believe in,
Professor? Evil?
O'RYAN
As citizen world, it's hard
to. Wouldn't say?
(Mackelway can't argue)
Evil us, I think -
natural order things. Like
gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave,
corrupting touches. A virus
invades cell, causing
dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But
occur
invaded virus,
capable mutate
powerfully?
Mackelway pauses, considering that.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Just something's invisible
doesn't mean doesn't exist.
Mackelway silent: Something's here. But can't
sure is...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Have seen fifty-foot shark?
43.
That wasn't echo question he's heard before;
red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.
MACKELWAY
I'm sorry?
O'RYAN
A shark, know, attack
humans runs food. But
biologists theorized
shark feet ocean
endless buffet. He'd run
food, he'd need come
surface. Consequently,
him. Do follow?
(Mackelway doesn't)
We'll one. But doesn't
mean don't exist. Hence Suspect
Zero.
Mackelway eyes books evil, ancient
weapons... Casually, imperceptibly, reaches
sidearm, O'Ryan continues:
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Some colleagues think I'm
fascinated evil. I think truth
opposite: evil fascinated
us. What better vehicle
creating havoc world -
better instrument - Man? We're vain,
we're stubborn, we're deceitful,
imagination limitless
perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying
harness us. Wouldn't you?
The talks, closer Mackelway comes extracting
gun...
Then, disturbing silence, KNOCK door.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Excuse me.
O'Ryan rises, goes door... Mackelway unholsters
gun. O'Ryan opens door. Standing COED,
backpack. She looks confused.
COED
Oh. I'm sorry. I looking
Professor--
44.
Just like that, O'Ryan bolted past Coed, literally
tossing Mackelway, exploding hall.
She screams. Mackelway grabs her, moves aside gently
time allows, blows room...
60 INT. BUILDING - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING 60
O'Ryan turns corner, vanishing. Mackelway follows.
61 INT. BUILDING - CORRIDOR CORNER - CONTINUING 61
Mackelway finds facing endless corridor: One

Then Mackelway spots EXIT SIGN. A stairwell...
62 INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING 62
Mackelway enters. The stairs stories UP here...
story DOWN. A sub-basement.
It's guess. He descends, gun drawn.
63 INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING 63
Mackelway emerges. "B-2" looks lot like B-1: long
endless. We hear air moving us, pipes carrying water,
wheezing old generator...
And, sides us, DOOES, mile them: maintenance
offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens - janitor's
supply. No here.
Tries door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked.
Air sucks corridor us. He thinks hears
footsteps corner. Runs them.
64 INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING 64
Nothing. No one. Just vast corridor. More doors.
Then, sound. GLASS, shattering floor. He runs

It's dark them, shadowy. Not bad place hide.
Farther corridor door - frosted

65 INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING 65
Mackelway enters. The lab dark. He throws light
switch reach... finds standing
shards GLASS BEAKER.
So he's right place. He scans it: rows work-
stations, microscopes row, sink it.
Lining walls wide CABINETS.
But there's MINI-LIBRARY here: Four rows
BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These "stacks" -
perfect hiding behind.
He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't anyone. Then Row #2, Row
#3, Row #4. Okay, stacks check out...
He walks rows work-stations, scanning, crouching,
nudging open cabinets. One opened:
Bottles SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And JAR that's
unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS it...
In room, INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's

Kneels down, looking darkness...
Then, NOISE. The FRONT DOOR lab swung open...
And O'Ryan bolted out. Fuck.

67 INT. "FURNACE ROOM" - CONTINUING 67
Five furnaces, separated sub-basement corridor

He moves amidst shadow noise: chugging engines,
humming, wheezing, slight vibration floor beneath
us. He walks edge Furnace #1...
...and assaulted, above.
O'Ryan falls him, knocking Mackelway hard sharp
CORNER furnace, ground. Mackelway's
gun skids floor.
And mouth, suddenly, covered gauze.
46.
He wants fight back... suddenly finds head
swimming. Something's gauze. The room getting
fuzzy.
We belly furnace - flames, heat. Then
BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST torn open corner
furnace.) Wait. Did glint KNIFE?
O'Ryan leaning us, utter control.
Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - sound
FOOTSTEPS. And hear:
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hey! You! What're here!
We turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush us, keys jangling.
It's foggy, wavy, distorted.
We O'Ryan RISE. Then goes black...
CUT TO:
68 INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 68
Mackelway's head ringing. Feels like hear
electricity walls him. Slowly, awakens. Above
fluorescent lights. Monitors blink...
Fran here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries sit up. The

FRAN
How ya doin'?
Mackelway half-nods. His chest bandaged.
CHARLTON
We're gonna need

The truth? Charlton pegged. But:
FRAN
Sir, I'm took call. Agent
Mackelway acting assumption
I'd checked guy out.
We're blame.
Hold it. That major exaggeration, outright
lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced.
Charlton, however, unmoved...
CHARLTON
Did Agent Mackelway attend interview
unaccompanied?
FRAN
(reluctantly)
Yes, Sir.
CHARLTON
Then fuck-up it?
Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks trying." She nods.
48.
MACKELWAY
(at Charlton)
It was... poor judgment, Sir.
CHARLTON
You wanna work alone, start

Mackelway nod. Then, bailing out,

Inexpensive, furnished touches
Mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique
books, photos eras. Character.
And candles. Lots candles. They throw SHADOWS Mackelway

An odd MUSIC fills room, coming BOOM-BOX

drums providing pulse.
It's eery, tuneless, awfully authentic... fits
intensity moment: Mackelway Katie, coupling madly,
eyes locked. She's breathless.

And he's expressing hour relent...
Katie gasps gasp, rolls edge

Trooper grabs knife, straightens. Examines it.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Psy Ops. Classified.
TROOPER

medication kind?
An 18-WHEEL TRUCK rumbles by, distracting O'Ryan... rendering
immobile moment.
TROOPER (CONT'D)

O'RYAN
Oh. Sorry. Just wondering

TROOPER

117 EXT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - EVENING 117
Mackelway approaches, carrying greasy bag: Frito Pie
soda. Fumbles keys... Then notices
something, waiting doorstep.
69.
It's FILE, roughly 150 pages, FOLDER. The word
"MACKELWAY" written front.
He leans down, opens folder. The light spotty

face: look pure awe.
118 INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - ENTRY - CONTINUING 118
The door bursts open. The greasy bag soda fall

dials hurriedly.
119 INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME 119
We're PARKING LOT outside WAL-MART. Fran's thrown

FRAN

MACKELWAY
O'Ryan. He left file doorstep.

coffee table:
A copy FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores,
citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career Special

FRAN
That's impossible.
MACKELWAY

FRAN
I don't believe it.
MACKELWAY

Then hear BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)

O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)

Mackelway's eyes wide.
MACKELWAY

MACKELWAY

O'RYAN
Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?
MACKELWAY

Sounds like O'Ryan laughed... Then, curve:
O'RYAN
Was pretty?
MACKELWAY
Huh?
O'RYAN
I hear moaning, right
Navajo chanting. Whole thing
downright tribal. What's look like?
That unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks feeling
violated, feeling "watched." He draws blinds. Double bolts
door. Runs hand window frame
kind wire tapping.
But Mackelway won't allow over-react. Not now,
O'Ryan phone.
MACKELWAY
(calmly)
You tell me.
O'Ryan laughs. He liked that.
O'RYAN
Fair enough. We'll stick business:

CUT TO:
120 INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (9 P.M.) 120
More rain falls outside. Lightning too. Mackelway waits here.
Piper's usual spot TV. Dyson descends

DYSON

That edge. Mackelway doesn't reply.
CUT TO:
121 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT 121
Mackelway stands center room, Dyson

ever. Tonight it's "Gilligan's Island" theme-song.
DYSON
I'll office.
Dyson backs away, leaving door ajar.
Now Mackelway - eyeing tiny bed, sink, window,
leaky ceiling, bucket, peeling paint. This room
heaving energy...
He sits bed, checks watch. 9:05 p.m.
Opposite bed WALL, re-painted industrial
white, hint shape underneath. It's
Mackelway's come investigate. INTERCUT WITH...
73.
122 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME 122
O'Ryan sits desk: eyes closed, writing pad wrist.
On it, unidentifiable lines visible

He holds point pen them,
receiving information it, jump into:
123 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 123
Mackelway. Sitting. Staring. Outside room hear
awful, toneless singing fills hallway.
Mackelway rises, approaching re-painted wall. He pulls
keys. Checks one's watching.
124 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 124
O'Ryan, pen pad, concentration total.
125 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 125
We hear singing, TV, rain, bucket collecting
drips. Semi-darkness... MORE LIGHTNING throws burst
white light wall.
A faint shape visible, beneath white paint.
Then vanishes again.
Using keys, begins scratch away white paint.
It's irrational thing - context
days makes odd kind sense.
Instantly, hint BLACK seen underneath...
126 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 126
O'Ryan, desk. Outside, hear 18-WHEEL TRUCK
rumble by. He doesn't allow distract him.
127 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 127
Mackelway scratches white paint wall.
More BLACKNESS appears beneath it. Then, SOUND him.
He turns.
The door room SHUT; outside must've
pushed it. He keeps scratching paint.
LIGHTNING rages outside. We PULL BACK, away wall,
gives opportunity Mackelway
close wall himself:
74.
There image beneath coat white
paint. It shape vast, black WAVE. A hand-painted
image large wall itself.
Mackelway tiny comparison, mere inch black
uncovered far infinitesimal.
In fact, look wave poised swallow
whole... can't it.
But can. Must've taken O'Ryan days paint
large. A vast, black wave. Evil itself...
And Mackelway, meaning to, unleash it.
128 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 128
O'Ryan, somehow, sensing going
room. Or maybe he's feeling power wave,
memory. Or maybe he's plain crazy.
But Mackelway, unspoken psychic level,
feeding another...
129 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 129
Mackelway chips away white paint, moving rapidly,
revealing blackness underneath. We PUSH IN it,
moving past Mackelway frantic scraping.
Then we're beneath coat white, and:
130 INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME 130
Somehow, we've submerged wave itself. A black, tidal
force nature.
And MOVING. Alive. We hear SOUNDS it: sucking,
yawning, tide drawing
exploding forward.
The sounds blend wind, rain, drops
bucket... Evil itself, move, gathering might. And we're
ride...
The wave begins roll forward shot cannon.
It massive, powerful, dark. And we're right forward
edge, surfing somehow.
131 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 131
O'Ryan reacts. Something changed:

132 INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING 132
The wave rushing forward speed power
tsunami.
...which hear laughter LITTLE BOY.
133 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 133
O'Ryan heard too. Then new images come -
are, first, GRAINY, CHOPPY...
134 EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME 134
The sounds wave fainter, receding
background, giving way sound laughter,
squeaking PLAY-SET SWING.
Like old tv slowly gaining reception, image takes
moment crystallize us. But sharpens:
We're PLAY AREA TRUCK-STOP DINER, feels
like we're looking broken lens. The images
appear SPHERICAL us, surrounded darkness.
Before 5-year old plays swing. Call CHARLIE.
135 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 135
Mackelway scraped away white paint -

136 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 136
O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell experiencing
past, present, future...
137 EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING 137
We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting look diner itself.
There, window, WOMAN, presumably Charlie's

138 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 138

We whip look Kathleen. She's busy

140 INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 140
O'Ryan keeps eyes shut, focus total...

141 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 141
Mackelway beginning perspire effort. More

142 EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING 142
That swing EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running
know where.
143 INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 143
O'Ryan's foot starts tap: anxiousness, discomfort.
144 EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING 144
We run... PARKING LOT. But smoothly,
effort, carried relentless black wave.
Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING Diner's
door, leads Play Area.
And hear horrified yell:
KATHLEEN (O.S.)
Charlie?! Charlie, you, Honey?!
(fainter)
Charlie?! Honey, here?!
The sound begins break bad radio, taken
sounds awful WAVE...
145 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 145
Mackelway suddenly stops... electric charge
shot him, short-circuiting stillness. He
begins step away wall.
77.
146 INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 146
O'Ryan lost "pulse" - connection allowed

He rises, hurrying tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT
WRITING PAD, trying decipher lines squiggles -
ideograms - hear sounds O'Ryan, retching.
147 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 147
Mackelway sits bed, looking he's
uncovered. An awesome sight. His head pounding worse

148 EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING 148
We've stepped SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs
infant, distraught, massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK
blows distance...
149 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING 149
O'Ryan washes face, eyes reflection mirror,
scrutinizing himself.
150 INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING 150
On wall opposite Mackelway, huge black wave
entirely visible him. Bits chipped white paint litter
floor.
A vast black wave. It fills wall...
Mackelway eyes watch. It's o'clock morning.
He's hours. That impossible.
CUT TO:
...a box, slamming hard desk. We are:
151 INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT 151
2:30 a.m. Mackelway himself, angry. He reaches
box. Inside? More pins. BLACK ONES. He crosses
map.
152 CLOSE-UP: MACKELWAY 152
He starts pulling YELLOW PINS we've grown accustomed
seeing map, replacing BLACK ONES,
tossing discards floor.
78.
153 A SERIES OF DISSOLVES 153
...as Mackelway replaces pin pin.
...Mackelway's face, backs away huge map.
154 INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATER NIGHT 154
Ten minutes passed, Mackelway seen revelation.
We read face.
He eyes map... stuck 1,000
BLACK PINS, city HAVE YOU SEEN ME
credit.
And black pins, seen distance, form pattern
weren't expecting - took shape
pins yellow.
Looks like big black WAVE. And that's is.
1,000 black dots conspiring form exact shape
O'Ryan painted wall room - massive wave
darkness, gathering strength.
But black wave consuming America...
Mackelway stares it: awed, bit frightened. The thing
vast, unstoppable... A black wave - pure malevolence,
covering states like fog.
One blue dot lies center: blue pin, heart
Greenville, Texas. Then, piercing silence:
CHARLTON (O.S.)
Got pins Denton yet?
Mackelway turns. Charlton leans doorway.
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
O'Ryan spotted tonight. Took
squad-car side-arm State
Trooper. 'Bout hour later five-year
old boy abducted, roughly mile
Interstate.
It's 3 a.m. What's guy here?
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
The vehicle abandoned
lot. We're establishing perimeter
city now.
79.
MACKELWAY
(knows already)
But Trooper wasn't hurt...
CHARLTON
What makes sure?
MACKELWAY
Professional courtesy.
Charlton's loss... Mackelway gestures table,
laid O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo,
citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.
Charlton eyes it, calmly. He's going let jaw drop,
Mackelway watching. So nods.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Is that... possible, Sir? An agent
deleted?
CHARLTON
Looks like it.
Mackelway pauses. It's depressing reality...
MACKELWAY
I couldn't understand - pushing
Speck's car state line. Makes
sense now. He wanted case
Federal. He's drawing in.
CHARLTON
Why that?
MACKELWAY
So we'd paying attention
Suspect Zero.
CHARLTON
Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired
hearing word. In fact, that's
gonna policy on. No Zero.
MACKELWAY
Sir, profile guy. He's straight outta
Quantico. All he's working
case, like would. He's kidnapping
little kids - he's chasing guy who's
kidnapping! Look map!
80.
CHARLTON
What're saying -
abductions work guy? Do
know fucking insane is?!
(over Mackelway)
Not let's try actually
makes sense: He sends faxes,
picks scumbags. For what?! So
we'll think exactly you're thinking
right - we've got friend
there, somebody willing
garbage rest us. And it's
horse-shit!
MACKELWAY
What isn't? What
Zero O'Ryan's guy
who's got shot him?
CHARLTON
(just blew top)
Fuck's sake, Mackelway -
start buying guy?!
A beat. Mackelway lets silence hover.
MACKELWAY
(quietly)
He's smarter are.
CHARLTON
Speak yourself.
Charlton heads door.
MACKELWAY
Sir? What I told I knew
catch him?
Charlton stops. Turns.
CHARLTON
Do you?
MACKELWAY
And I told way I'd
catch involved sitting dark

collective unconscious. Something. If I
told I thought I target

MACKELWAY (CONT'D)

building, say?
CHARLTON
I'd you'd watched "X-Files."
MACKELWAY
Y'ever heard project called
"Icarus," Sir?
CHARLTON
No.
Mackelway tosses pages O'Ryan's file.
MACKELWAY
Agents, trained "see" distant
locations mind.
They called Remote Viewing.
Charlton eyes pages comment.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Army stole Soviets. The
Bureau stole Army -
track serial killers.
(a beat)
Experimental program. O'Ryan
agent recruited.
CHARLTON
Good him.
MACKELWAY
Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit.
(Charlton's waiting)
...except, worked. It's drew
this:
Mackelway's referring DRAWING: steamer-trunk, filled
ghastly Ziploc bags:
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
He'd house before. He
saw - Bureau
taught how... deleted
him. Same that's trying catch
now... Does
strike odd?
Charlton studies him, long beat, measuring him... Then:
82.
CHARLTON
I'm going Denton Oh-Six-Hundred.
You day off.
With that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway here.
Nothing look black wave... He hears Charlton,
leaving building.
He slams Vicoden, hears PHONE RING. Fuck it.
He's moving. Let Voice Mail it.
...until hears sound FAX coming in.
He rises. Follow him:
155 INT. FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING 155
Mackelway hurries office, sound fax
grows louder.
156 INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING 156
He enters. The fax spun single sheet. No top-sheet.
That's odd...
But here's face, victim, customary
HAVE YOU SEEN ME? top.
A young African-American boy: "Lloyd Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10",
Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville, Texas. Date

That's it. One face. The transmission ends. Mackelway eyes
vitals. They mean something. Greenville...
157 INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN'S ROOM - RESUMING 157
He re-enters, approaches huge MAP. There's wave
black pins, BLUE PIN center;
Greenville, "10-26" written it.
Mackelway pulls lone blue pin, replaces
black one. Now wave complete. All black...
CUT TO:

picks CASSETE, shoves tape deck.
And comes sound "Barney Dinosaur."
BARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO)
Oh silly songs sillier/When hear

The truck continues rumble along.
CUT TO:

6 a.m. Fran pauses outside O'Ryan Room... Mackelway
sleeps chair. Poor guy night.
She regards him... eyes MAP, gaping
black wave it. A horrible image...
She studies Mackelway again, tenderly, until:
CHARLTON (O.S.)
Does listen you?
She turns, startled. Here's Charlton, right her. And
she's caught... watching Mackelway sleep.
FRAN
I'm sorry?
CHARLTON
It's strength his. I'm noticing
lately.
Truth is, doesn't like Charlton. Or trust him...
FRAN
He's fine.
CHARLTON
I'm sure.
(a beat)
You oughtta sit down, remind
chain-of-command works.
FRAN
He's fine, Sir.

MACKELWAY

FRAN

Alabama.
(Neither city represented black pins map.)
She slides packet PHOTOS: FEMALE VICTIMS,
photographed separate morgues - face up, face down, waist
above, waist below, etc.
Mackelway eyes them, leaves room. We STAY WITH
FRAN... taking O'Ryan FBI file. It troubles her.
Mackelway returns, carrying 9-by-12 envelope Katie
gave him.
FRAN (CONT'D)
(re: O'Ryan's file)
So happens agent
spins out? He gets deleted?
MACKELWAY
Sometimes. The lucky ones sent
Wichita Falls.
She breathes ironic laugh. He hands envelope,
opens it. Inside: photo Karen Sumpter. Mackelway
didn't pay attention before.
Fran eyes photo, vitals.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Friend Receptionist, missing
year now. I told I'd let
know body turned up.
Fran doesn't look photo.
FRAN
The Receptionist.
MACKELWAY
Her name's Katie.
She half-smiles: "You mean you've fucking?" He
shrugs, confirming - wishing Fran weren't
smart. She puts photo envelope.
FRAN
I got blue pin

86.
MACKELWAY
Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.
That confused her.
FRAN
(re: Sumpter)
No. I meant her. The girl.
That confused him.
MACKELWAY
What're talking about?
FRAN
Did ya look vitals?
She hands material Karen Sumpter.
FRAN (CONT'D)

He grabs material, looks time:
"Karen Sumpter, Age 25. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 110. Eyes Blu, Hair
Blnd. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date Disappearance: 10-26-

The came night: Lloyd

Mackelway grabs Simms fax, hurries room.

FRAN
Wait. When establish Zero

MACKELWAY
O'Ryan thinks so.
FRAN

That's million-dollar question, hangs there.
Mackelway's answer... stops himself. Just
noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO Logan, Utah:
There's BURN MARK lower left calf victim.
We've seen mark before, autopsy photo.
MACKELWAY
I've seen before.
FRAN
Huh?
He doesn't answer, hurries BOX OF OTHER

...until finds we've seen before. The body
Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation...
He lays PHOTOS side. Looks Fran.
MACKELWAY
Same burn-mark.

I saw didn't register.
Fran eyes photos. No doubt -

horizontal stripe flesh.

FRAN
He burns them?
MACKELWAY
I dunno. Almost looks symmetrical

Mackelway nods - sense. Shit.

Mackelway turns, Vic's past us.
Something attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk,
attitude. Something.
So Mackelway watching - knowing - Vic
crosses parking lot, heading rig. It's beast.
Vic climbs in, unaware he's watched.
Mackelway looks away, chiding allowing guy

And sees LITTLE BOY 5, cab Vic's rig...
But little boy SCREAMING, struggling

little Charlie - can't tell here.
But Vic yelling him: "Shut up!"
And Vic's truck refrigerated. He's hauling

94.
172 EXT. MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING 172
He gets Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS
THE LOT WITH HIM.
He reaches Vic's truck, looks passenger window. There's
year-old kid, tears streaming face. (We
can't tell it's Charlie.)
Mackelway reaches passenger-side door. It's locked. Of
course. And can't shoot way in.
He looks kid inside:
MACKELWAY
You okay?
(Kid's blank)
Kid? You okay there?
The Kid doesn't respond - spooked. Shit...

rigs, turns corner and:
...runs smack Benjamin O'Ryan.
The shock total takes moment

Mackelway's speechless, trying recalibrate himself. A
second ago chasing possible Zero. Now he's face
face O'Ryan.
And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, amused.
O'RYAN
Well, well... Must moment

Mackelway hasn't spoken, until:
MACKELWAY

177 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING 177
Mackelway gets in, hits ignition. Reaches cel-

Awfully conventional - don't ya think?
Mackelway pauses.
MACKELWAY

O'RYAN
Apprehend fugitive,

MACKELWAY

Mackelway lets disgusted sigh.
MACKELWAY

He punches "Talk" button, taking eyes O'Ryan

...What follows blur:
O'Ryan lunges forward like animal, throwing cuffed
wrists Mackelway's head, yanking Mackelway
seat violent tug. The gun falls.
We POP OUTSIDE THE YUKON, pulling back... obscuring view
what's going inside truck.
That cel-phone continues ring... We pulling back,
sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling.
The cel-phone stops ringing. CONTINUE PULLING BACK, taking

peril beneath them...
CUT TO:
179 INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY) 179
Fran arrived. She scans place. Doesn't
Mackelway. Great. She reaches cel-phone again...
CUT TO:
180 INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 180
Mackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms
legs bound. His mouth GAGGED.
And staring REFLECTION.
He lies side. A MIRROR propped floor,
inches face - leaving look
himself.
He strains ropes, there's them.
He's helpless, powerless. And mirror forcing
watch perfect clarity.
100.
A feet away, O'Ryan sits chair, calmly peeling
skin apple huge HUNTING KNIFE his. A
CANDLE flickers floor feet.
O'RYAN
Are afraid?
There delight question -
O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, course, can't reply
gag. But answer's obvious.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(quoting himself, Daitz:)
"Imagine killer patterns,
tell-tale fetishes, rituals
kind. No hidden desire caught. A
perfect vessel evil."
All Mackelway reflection - fear
eyes - bouncing mirror that's inches away.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
And killer...
Zero.
(again:)
Are afraid?
Slowly, lowers knife flame candle
floor. It GLOWS. Good God...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
It'd customary point start
praying. I hear lot that. Haven't
seen answers though. I wouldn't
hold breath waiting
janitor break save you,
either. You're alone.
Mackelway tries speak. It's impossible.
O'Ryan pulls GAG mouth, long
Mackelway say:
MACKELWAY
Where's boy?
O'Ryan jams gag mouth, angrily.
O'RYAN
(re: mirror)
My, my. Must extremely satisfying
watch heroic.
I'm envious.

101.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(casually)
The boy's bed. In pieces. Are
afraid?
Mackelway absorbs - watches absorb -
looks bed. Can't what's it...
O'Ryan eyes flames dance blade.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
I know you're thinking: "There
pain coming. Am I going like
man?" Let ease: You won't.
None do. Men, women, children.
They weep, beg. They pass
out, piss themselves. They attempt
negotiation: You wouldn't believe
men lain right you're
lying right - grown men, wives
children home - offering
kinds sexual gratification exchange
minute reprieve. It's
pathetic. Are afraid?
(of course, reply)
Then there's moment
realize there's left
negotiated. They're mine. And
they're helpless. And look
eyes, level surrender... well,
it's pornographic. I
mirror I don't want
miss it. Are afraid?
With that, lifts hunting knife flame. It
RED-HOT. Even looking painful.
But Mackelway can't look else.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
How now?
Just like that, red-hot knife inch Mackelway's
face. The heat makes head jerk back. Wisps smoke
rise edge.
And Mackelway forced watch reaction it.
He struggles ropes, use. A guttural sound
comes him.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Are afraid?
102.
O'Ryan's hand lashes bit, leaving sizzling knife
Mackelway's chin. The anticipation pain
unbearable. And Mackelway reading eyes...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?
Two things hit once: 1) This monster torture
death. 2) Please, God, don't let
satisfaction seeing cry...
O'Ryan moves blade again, time eighth inch
Mackelway's right arm. The heat incendiary
Mackelway's shirt begins smoke.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Are you?
Mackelway's shirt officially now. The pain
awful. He stares reflection.
...as tears begin flow eyes. He can't stop them.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(top lungs)
Are afraid?!
That bounces walls. Mackelway shuts eyes tight -
can't watch anymore.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(infuriated)
Open eyes! Open eyes Goddammit
I'll cut fucking lids off!!
Mackelway opens eyes, forced watch break. Deep
sobs shudder him, as...
O'Ryan digs red-hot blade Mackelway's arm:
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
ARE YOU AFRAID?!?!
Mackelway sees answer reflection: Yes, I
terrified. He SHRIEKS, sound muffled gag.
With body able spasm, jerks head
forward, smashing mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS,
obliterating image.
...and goes black.
103.
Then, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless beat
back:
180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME 180a
Out soupy darkness, dreamlike spin location we've
visited before: It wheat field O'Ryan Remote
Viewed countless times. Only time
Mackelway's fever, nightmare... We tall wheat,
wet wind - familiar images us. All pounding Chant
Navaho.
But OTHER IMAGES enter world. They're jarring:
-That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming mouth,
dancing frenzy. Then curtain wheat
obscures him, revealing:
-Fran, Katie, giggling, crooking fingers inviting
us. Looks like they're naked. But approach them,
farther away. Then curtain wheat
separates reveals:
-Charlton, extending hand us, warmly, congratulating
something, job done, when:
Mackelway hunting wet wheat, gun drawn.
He FIRES... Then looks he's shot.
A body. He turns over.
...and staring himself, lying dead ground
mud pouring rain. It moment shock horror,
giving way we...
181 FADE UP AGAIN... 181
...on O'Ryan - desk, sitting upright, making notes
pad. Calm. Businesslike. His turned us.
182 INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT 182
Time passed. We don't know much. Or maybe we're dead,
dreaming. It's hard say...
But there's O'Ryan, desk. Writing...
Mackelway's eyes open. His FOREHEAD bright red
raspberry smashing mirror.
But brain functioning. It starts running
check-list:
104.
I'm motel room. I'm bed. I'm alive. There's
O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's right arm. But
searing.
The check-list continues: mouth sore, GAG
removed.
And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I dead.
Mackelway tries hand. It takes effort.
Everything's foggy. But puts face. Turns it.
Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares it.
Then notices SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE wrapped
- covering source searing pain. Looks
nurse tended it.
But sure hell isn't hospital...
Then, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils
meaning to.
But O'Ryan's demeanor changed. That look possessed
malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.
O'RYAN
(softly)
Stand up.
Mackelway pauses, rewinding one.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
It's now. Can stand?
Mackelway bracing torture, combat. So
he's step behind.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
We go.
O'Ryan rises, crossing us. Even unbound, Mackelway
expecting onslaught... But O'Ryan drop
piece paper Mackelway's lap.
It's DRAWING: RANCH-HOUSE, windmill
background. Crude, specific enough. Mackelway's
unwound speak...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
This he'll be. With boy.
(a beat)
Zero. He's coming home today. We're going
there.
105.
Mackelway's starting understand now. This act. An
initiation. That stuns him...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
You're ready come now. You've
pit. Stand up.
Mackelway eyes - utter disbelief.
O'Ryan smiles warmly - like Drill Sergeant end
Basic: Sorry I hard done... Can
shake it?
Instead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:
It blur, faster blur, Mackelway rises
animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat back.
Then Mackelway him.
All helplessness, horror, images watching
mirror, sounds uncontrollable
sobbing... ERUPT violence.
It overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin fight
off. Mackelway hand O'Ryan's throat. The hand
comes like sledgehammer.
One blow. Then another. The sounds coming Mackelway
savage, barely human. He's control.
O'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway puts hands
fucker's throat. He's going kill - right here.
He's going squeeze life him.
This Mackelway we've met before. His eyes wild,
hateful - gasps breath rasp way
O'Ryan's throat.
Then Mackelway distracted, second. No. Less
second... glimpse SHATTERED MIRROR -
twisted image.
He looks away it, refusing distracted, determined
kill guy.
...then eyes drift mirror again.
...and sees reflection: hardened, crazed stranger. An
animal.
His hands, warning, release grip.
106.
O'Ryan gasps air. His face bloodied. Mackelway
rises, disgusted, removing great weight O'Ryan's chest.
That makes breathing little easier.
Mackelway crosses tiny, cheap BATHROOM.
183 INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING 183
Mackelway enters. There's mirror too. That fat
BANDAGE shoulder stares him.
He tugs - doesn't unravel it, yanks arm -
revealing hideous wound.
It's ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT.
Now clicks: O'Ryan branding him. Initiating
red-hot knife.
Mackelway stares wound, eyes lifeless. He splashes
water face, mind reeling.
Then O'Ryan appears doorway. He looks like hell -
face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat...
Mackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, places
DRAWING Ranch-House sink. Mackelway eyes it.
Then O'Ryan stuns him... laying Mackelway's GUN atop
drawing, word.
Mackelway eyes gun, grabs points right
O'Ryan's face, inches away.
We're TIGHT Mackelway's hand. It trembles rage.
But O'Ryan, looking right barrel, unafraid. In
fact smiles, utterly confident. Then:
O'RYAN
(re: gun)
Soon. I promise... But yet.
He eases Mackelway's hand down, lowering gun. Then
O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, heads
door.
Mackelway stands, rigid. He raises gun. Maybe I'll
shoot fucker back.
Then IMAGES come again, nowhere:
107.
184 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT 184
Out gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly focus: Wet
wind, tall wheat, heavy BREATHING run... And
non-descript voice heard echoing earlier
sound O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling:
O'RYAN (O.S.)
Please... I'm begging you.
That clear enough. A gun rises. We holding
it...
Then images vanish, jolted to:
185 INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING 185
Mackelway tightens. O'Ryan's door. This VISION
keeps getting clearer clearer... What hell
mean?
Down Vicodens...
CUT TO:
186 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT 186
A huge STORM devours scenery sides us. O'Ryan
drives. Mackelway sits, expression face,
recovering happened room...
Silence... Then:
MACKELWAY
Tell Icarus.
O'RYAN
Why?
MACKELWAY
Just... wanna know.
O'Ryan eyes him. The sky black.
O'RYAN

Mackelway's ears...

That said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
If right, got it:
The way sounded. The way smelled...
Those people looking you,
begging mercy. It like
God.
(a beat)
...except you're not. Because can't

You're watching, helpless.
He pauses.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
They wired current,

plugged right it. But taught
shut off...
(thinking back...)
We men. And saw things men
shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil -
shut off. Even now, it's
there.
MACKELWAY
They wind like you? The
agents?
O'RYAN
No. They're dead now.
Oh. Mackelway doesn't reply...
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
They broke down. Then opted out.
(Mackelway's blank)
Killed themselves... After while,
conversations Yankees
impossible. Ya see?
Mackelway lets sink in, stares passing head-
lights. Then:
MACKELWAY
I'm sorry.
109.
O'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat
rain...
CUT TO:
187 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT 187
O'Ryan continues drive. Silence hangs. Then:
O'RYAN
We're here.
Mackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls at:
188 EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING 188
We've seen place before. That is, we've seen
O'Ryan's DRAWING, lies dashboard us: A
ranch-style house WINDMILL backyard.
O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds roof hood. Wind
blows. Mackelway studies house. Then eyes shift
briefly drawing.
MACKELWAY
Can't bring me. You know
that.
O'Ryan shrugs, raises hands: "Cuff me."
The CUFFS lying floor seat. Mackelway
reaches back, grab them... golden opportunity O'Ryan
club guy.
But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then stops.
Simply ask:
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Those faxes, Have-You-Seen-Me's...
How 'em actually
responsible for?
O'Ryan lays right out:
O'RYAN
All 'em.
Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan steering wheel
approaches house.
110.
189 EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING 189
The place disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint,

No one's visible. He walks house.
190 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING 190
O'Ryan watches Mackelway vanishes. This moment
opportunity. With free hand, reaches pocket,
grabbing lighter.
191 EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING 191
Mackelway moves cautiously, pelted rain. But
inside Living Room home:
It's bit time warp: plastic furniture, old
radiator, pictures mantle antique frames.
And OLD LADY, leaning record player.
Tough hear what's playing - we're outside, storm
pounding - sounds like Glenn Miller. There's
old tv here: "Wizard Oz" it.
The lady 70, frail, thin. She happens BLIND.
Cataracts eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches
her... exits room, heading kitchen.
He moves window.
192 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING 192
O'Ryan, keeping eyes house, lights
lighter... holds flame CHAIN connecting

The chain begins heat up...
193 EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING 193
Mackelway watches Delia makes way kitchen.
It, too, era: dishwasher stands
center floor, connected sink long hose.
The refrigerator, table, toaster - old.
The oven antique too. Delia crosses it, grabs
towel, opens it... pulls CAKE it.
111.
She brings cake kitchen table, moving
lady can't see. On table old-fashioned baker's
frosting tube.
She grabs it, hands orient herself... begins
write cake, frosting. Slowly.
Mackelway can't cake, can. The
letters, beautiful cursive, read: "Happy Bir..." It's
work progress.
194 INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING 194
O'Ryan handcuff chain GLOWING now. We don't know

The passenger-side door opened, abruptly.
MACKELWAY
It's birthday, isn't it?
O'Ryan turns. Here's Mackelway, gets eyeful
O'Ryan's lighter.
O'Ryan pockets it, bit sheepishly. Mackelway decides
ignore thing...
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
He comes home birthday.
O'Ryan nods. Then Delia's door swings open.
DELIA (O.S.)
(aloud, delighted)
Darling?! That you?!
195 EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING 195
Delia stands open doorway: old blind lady, talking
dark rainy street. That confuses them.
...until hear rumble 18-WHEEL TRUCK.
It turns corner street. Mackelway turns now...
We've seen truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And
Mackelway straightens, reaching sidearm. Behind him,
Delia smiles excitedly, dancing.
But smile soon leaps face... hears
sound 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, tires locking-
wet road.
112.
Mackelway gets look DRIVER - wiry, sinewy man
35... Let's ZERO.
Their eyes lock - Zero throws rig gear
begins rumble street.
DELIA (CONT'D)

No answer. That truck rumbling away. Mackelway turns,

Mackelway jumps Yukon, unlocking cuffs.
MACKELWAY

The Yukon swerves hard right, narrowly avoiding
tail end Zero's rig swings path.
Mackelway drops phone. Grabs again.
MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D)
Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.
Zero - swinging rear rig
road, forcing O'Ryan swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved
curb, clunks street again.
113.
Then Zero jams brakes. Mackelway's eyes wide.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(at O'Ryan)
Brakes!
O'Ryan jumps brakes. The Yukon screeches stop,
throwing sideways slide. It bangs, passenger
first, rear truck, breaking window.
Mackelway ducks way breaking glass. Then rig
pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.
198 THE CHASE - CONTINUING 198
Zero's rig turns hard SERVICE ROAD, running parallel
Interstate. Mackelway locked truck.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(into cel-phone again)
Travelling west now. Don't
name. It's service road, running
parallel the--
Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He saw
jaw drop:
On road field TALL WHEAT.
Time stop. His blood feels like congealed.
Tall wheat wet wind. He before. He seen
before.
And O'Ryan...
Mackelway stares, slack-jawed, wheat whips past
them. The feeling unsettling moment
forgets Zero, rig, kid...
Everything crystallized horrible way. He knows
going wind wheat field, somehow,
O'Ryan.
And O'Ryan begging mercy. "Please..."
O'Ryan guns Yukon, attempting cut rig.
Zero swings wide, sending Yukon curb time.
That shreds tire.
...which means minute car going
undriveable. So don't stop Zero hitting
Interstate - - Zero gone.
114.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(absently)
What're you...
O'RYAN
Can't let hit Interstate.
Mackelway braces himself, O'Ryan guns car left
rig, shredded tire all. Then:
He pulls right rig. At 60 m.p.h. And
jams brakes.
Zero swerves, instinct. It throws rig
vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips cab,
swatting Yukon away like fly.
We're inside Yukon rolls, Mackelway O'Ryan look
like tinker toys.
The torque pulls Zero's rig side, sliding hard. Metal
hits concrete, sending shower SPARKS.
The Yukon winds ditch alongside service road,
upside down. Mackelway, alive awake, strains look
busted windshield.
What sees hard discern - looks like Zero's rig
lying flat side.
And, course, mere yards wheat field...
199 EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING 199
The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But passenger-side
door pops open. And Zero pokes it, eyes
immediately scanning TALL WHEAT. Rain pours.
Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, blacked second
opens eyes, getting picture hurry.
Zero leaps ground, rolls, rises. Only thing
hand TIRE IRON. Carrying it, sprints wheat
field - vanishing.
Mackelway bursts Yukon, pursuit. O'Ryan's door
stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop help - barrels
street.
Just - STATE RANGER CAR arrives.
115.
MACKELWAY
(over shoulder, running)
Get van open! He's got kid
van!
STATE RANGER hurries squad car. Mackelway sprints
tall wheat.
O'Ryan, grunt, gets door open. Now
disappears Wheat Field.
200 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING 200
Tall wheat stiff wet wind, drop moonlight
guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea he's
going.
...except he's before. He's seen it. And
feeling inevitability this; it's haunting.
He's practically blind here. Can't feet
him. Nothing sound breathing.
That, too, presaged. Those visions...
201 EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING 201
It's locked. Ranger pulls handgun blows lock
away.
202 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING 202
Mackelway keeps running, deaf blind.
O'Ryan running nearby, can't hear
another.
203 INT. THE TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING 203
200 sides beef lie sides. Ranger plunges in.
Then Ranger spots, van, FALSE-WALL
hide secret compartment.
The crash collapsed false-wall. Frozen air
blows wisps. He climbs carcasses, fast
can...
204 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING 204
Mackelway keeps going, running blind.
116.
Then, sound, ahead. Sounds like noise
stumbling. Mackelway stops. Listens.
Silence. The sound repeat itself.
He continues along, step cautious step now.
205 INT. TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING 205
Ranger gets carcasses, pulling
now-open compartment.
First thing REFRIGERATION ROD,
responsible freezer burns.
Then Charlie, bound. He's trembling cold, he's
alive. His leg presses rod.
206 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING 206
Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding. He hears noise
left. Whips around, gun poised.
But it's nothing. He sighs. The wheat sounds like it's
laughing him.
Then TIRE IRON lashes out, right.
It catches Mackelway horrific force, shattering wrist
sending gun flying wheat.
Before Mackelway react, Zero him...
207 EXT. THE TOPPLED RIG - RESUMING 207
Fran's Ford skids stop outside van.
...just Ranger brings Charlie rig. The kid
shaking, traumatized. He begins cry...
Fran gets idea. She hurries over.
208 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING 208
Mackelway Zero wrestle, surrounded obscured
wheat... Zero monster, he's got tire iron.
Mackelway busted wrist. Hardly fair fight.
But Mackelway battling: kicking, clawing, getting
shots can. His shirt rips away body,
exposing brand-mark. They roll forth. Until:
117.
O'RYAN (O.S.)
(calmly, firmly)
Up.
Zero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn find:
O'Ryan... stands here, Mackelway's gun hand.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Up.
Mackelway's relief total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero
pulls ground, chagrinned.
ZERO
(re: Mackelway)
Glad you're here, Man. Guy
kill me.
O'Ryan, ceremony, puts bullet Zero's left
palm. That got Mackelway's attention.
Zero howls pain, palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls
ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.
MACKELWAY
I'll here.
He extends good hand O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses.
Then...
O'RYAN
Are going shoot him?
MACKELWAY
Give gun, O'Ryan.
ZERO
Hey, I surrendered.
O'RYAN
Shut up.
ZERO
I surrendered! That's it!
O'RYAN
SHUT UP!!!
O'Ryan wheels around, aiming gun right Zero's face.
That shuts guy hurry.
118.
From service road now, hear line SIRENS,
approaching distance. Unit unit.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(quietly now)
Look him, Mack. He's human
anymore. Go dig old lady's
backyard - you'll bodies there...
Maybe hundreds them. Of course, ya
gotta warrant first, chain
custody's gotta followed. One breach,
walks.
(no reply)
My way, he's eliminated; world rid
him. It's lot closer justice
having Prosecutor tell you've
left tissue sample wrong lab.
Isn't it?
MACKELWAY
(that stung)
Give fucking gun!
O'Ryan turns, studies him.
...and hands gun. Just like that.
Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't word, crosses
Zero, grabs TIRE-IRON ground.
O'Ryan's standing right Zero, as:
O'RYAN
(at Mackelway)
You understand:
arbitrary. We chosen, I.
WHAP! O'Ryan swung tire-iron Zero's rib cage.
We hear bones crack, air rushing guy's lungs. He
drops knees, gasping.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
I saw here. You too.
THUMP! Another violent swing tire-iron, busting
Zero's torso. Now sides rib-cage
shattered. Breathing impossible.
Mackelway tightens. His head began throb...
MACKELWAY
Okay. You point.
119.
O'RYAN
Bullshit! If I'd fucking point
would've shot now!
Another swing tire-iron, Zero's
neck. He crumbles, face down.
Fuck it. Mackelway crosses O'Ryan puts gun right
O'Ryan's head.
MACKELWAY
Enough!
Then, odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.
Something having gun pointed right - it's
relief.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Drop it.
O'RYAN
Or what?
MACKELWAY
Just drop it.
O'RYAN
Would shoot me?
That's Mackelway doesn't want consider.
MACKELWAY
Put down.
O'RYAN
(calmly)
I want think second. About
destiny. Who are. You're cursed,
like I - running
it.
(Mackelway's silent)
You hear things. You things. That's
can't sleep, head
aches.
He turns. They face face. Nothing gun
them.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
...and it's going let
kill animal. And you're going
kill me.
120.
That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes moment -
wheeling around...
He takes swing Zero, like lumberjack. The tire-
iron impacts Zero's skull dull THUD, cracking it. He
dead.
Mackelway's eyes wide. Whole thing blur.
O'Ryan releases tire-iron... drops knees like
man awaiting execution, Mackelway.
Mackelway silent. Stunned. The blood Zero's caved-in
skull finds way O'Ryan's knees.
But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.
MACKELWAY
Get up.
O'RYAN
I can't that, Mack. I've seen
already. For months now.
MACKELWAY
Get up.
O'RYAN
Every time, we're field:
wind, rain. And you...
He puts finger head, pretending it's gun. Then
pretends pull trigger. Mackelway gets idea.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
It's okay. I want to. I'm begging
to.
Mackelway doesn't know do. Then, making matters worse:
FRAN (O.S.)
(aloud)
Mack?
She's yards away... she'll soon
enough. That puts heat O'Ryan:
O'RYAN
I'm tired, Mack.
FRAN (O.S.)
Can hear me?
121.
She's 90 yards now...
O'RYAN
Pull trigger...
(no reply)
I'm going jail. Now pull
fucking trigger!
Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Fucking coward.
O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Some things decide.
They exist. They're inevitable. This
field. This rain. This moment. It
happened. You know that. You've
seen too.
He shoves Mackelway chest.
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack?
She's 70 yards now...
O'RYAN
Shut me.
MACKELWAY
I'm going kill you, O'Ryan.
O'RYAN
Of course will. I've seen it.
MACKELWAY
You saw wrong!
O'RYAN
(incredulous)
That's impossible.
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack? Can hear me?
50 yards now. Maybe close hear O'Ryan's voice...
O'RYAN
(rambling, unraveling)
You don't understand. Those fucking faces
(MORE)
122.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
map. They me. I
eyes dark - they're staring me:
"How let happen me?" But
that's thing - they're
like pictures. They blink. They
just...stare, me. That's
destiny, see? I didn't help
needed
penance. Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I'm
opting now, ya it? I can't stand
anymore! I wanna close eyes

torture.
(Mackelway's expressionless)
It's bad start, Mack. We've
world little safer now. Speck,
Fulcher, Starkey, Zero. We've
justice. But I too. You
end me. That's you're
here. It's destiny.
MACKELWAY
Stop telling fucking destiny!
O'RYAN
(again)
But I've seen it!
MACKELWAY
Open eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am,
standing here. I'm shooting you.
Doesn't fucking tell something?
You're guy skill. Period. They
taught should've. I'm
sorry that... But you're God.
You can't everything.
O'RYAN
Yes I can! And too! That's I
chose you!
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack?
Mackelway's budging. O'Ryan that.
O'RYAN
(re: tire-iron)
Fine. I'll easy you:
O'Ryan picks tire-iron. Mackelway sees what's coming.
O'Ryan swings tire-iron Mackelway backs
range.
123.
MACKELWAY
Put fucking thing down, O'Ryan.
O'Ryan keeps pursuing. Another swing. Mackelway keeps backing
up. The swing misses.
O'RYAN
Look. It's perfect. Won't need
hearing way. You apprehended
suspect commission murder.
Then turned fired
self-defense.
O'Ryan isn't letting up. And Mackelway can't fire.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
These things bigger -
haven't seen yet? Destiny.
Justice. Mercy. They're vast. We're
puppets!
MACKELWAY
I'm going kill you!
O'RYAN
You don't decide that!
MACKELWAY
Yes I do!
O'Ryan takes swing, as:
FRAN (O.S.)
FREEZE!!!
Silence. Mackelway turns. So O'Ryan.
There's Fran, emerging tall wheat, gun trained right
O'Ryan. His shock total.
FRAN (CONT'D)
Drop it.
O'Ryan doesn't first. Then, slowly, ironic smile
snakes way lips.
O'RYAN
(at Mackelway, surprised)
It's funny. I saw
here. Did you?
Mackelway doesn't answer. He can't. O'Ryan eyes him.
124.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Do it, Mack. Please.
(Mackelway's silent)
Please. I'm begging you.
There was: thing Mackelway's hearing
time, exact words. Unsettling hell.
...and begin INTERCUT: images moment images
"VISIONS" hinting
wheatfield Page One...
208a INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WHEATFIELD "FANTASY" - SAME 208a
Tall wheat, wet wind, O'Ryan's voice: "I'm begging you..."
...Mackelway snaps vision.
MACKELWAY
I can't.
That attempt images stop, deny
awful, inevitable conclusion.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
I'm you.
O'RYAN
Yet.
Two men, flinching... O'Ryan nods -
"Good-bye."
...more vision interrupts now: gun, rising...
O'Ryan rears swings tire-iron right
Mackelway's head.
Fran choice. She fires.
O'Ryan hit right shoulder blades. The tire-iron
hits Mackelway shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles ground,
landing face up.
...a body slumping ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands
him...
Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands O'Ryan,
O'Ryan envisioned it. That makes smile,
he's dying.
125.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(weak)
Thank you.
Then dies, eyes open. Mackelway looks Fran...
DISSOLVE TO:
209 EXT. SERVICE ROAD - DAWN 209
Hours passed. Dozens LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES
arrived. Sherrifs, Feds. Zero's rig remains side.
Mackelway sits nearby CURB, shattered wrist
SLING. Up above, CLOUDS parted. Morning sun streaks
through. No rain. Fran sits him.
At feet, gutter service road, lies
discarded MILK CARTON, covered dust. The face
"Have You Seen Me?" unknown us.
Kathleen nearby, holding Charlie tight. Cops surround them.
An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives. Charlton hurries it, making
bee-line Mackelway.
CHARLTON
Nice work.
(Mackelway half-nods)
Where he?
MACKELWAY
Sir?
CHARLTON
O'Ryan. Where he?
Mackelway rises, studies Charlton. There's say.
So extends hand Fran. She takes it, rising
feet. They leave Charlton behind...
We PULL AWAY them, craning up, taking expanse
tall wheat, TILTING UP morning sun.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
...an AFTERNOON SUN - blazing white hot. TILT DOWN...
126.
210 EXT. DELIA'S RANCH-HOUSE - DAY 210
We're distance away. HEAT RISES parched Earth,
lending vaporous screen everything. But
shapes men HAZ-MAT SUITS.
Delia's backyard torn BACK-HOE. Looks like
war-zone: BODIES, wrapped cloth, exhumed
ground. Dozens them...
But there's plenty soil turned... Might
HUNDREDS unearthed time guys through. We...
FADE OUT...
