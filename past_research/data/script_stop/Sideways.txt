MAYA
Why Pinot? It's like
thing you.
Miles laughs first, smiles wistfully question.
He searches answer glass begins slowly.
MILES
I don't know. It's hard grape
grow. As know. It's thin-skinned,
temperamental, ripens early. It's
survivor like Cabernet

neglected. Pinot needs constant
care attention fact
grow specific little tucked-
away corners world. And
patient nurturing growers
really, tap Pinot's
fragile, delicate qualities.
Only taken time
truly understand potential
Pinot coaxed fullest
expression. And happens,

ancient planet.
Maya answer revealing moving.
MILES
I mean, Cabernets powerful
exalting, prosaic
reason. By comparison.
How you?

No, I like think
life wine, it's living thing.
I like think going
year grapes growing,
sun shining summer
rained... weather
like. I think
people tended picked
grapes, it's old wine,
dead now. I
love wine continues evolve,
time I open bottle it's
going taste different I
opened day.
Because bottle wine actually
alive -- it's constantly evolving
gaining complexity. That is,
peaks -- like '61 --
begins steady, inevitable
decline. And tastes fucking
good.
