FADE IN:
EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING
ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown crisp...
clinging branch... solitary sign life
barren tree.
A gust wind... leaf breaks free... flutters down,
landing slow current Missouri. The leaf
fall, taking final journey south.
As floats surface, rising falling
current, hear river's gentle movement...
trickle water... splash timid rapids...
DISTANT VOICES invade world... soft first,
growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING.
And leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... BOW OF A
BOAT. We hear VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES,
rise bow... it's FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR
center river.
Beyond flatboat voices... TWENTY MEN Rocky

jacket long fringe... belt pulled tightly
waist pistols knife hanging it. He
stands others... like imposter pretending

gloves... examines BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining palm.
From camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid
thick... dark eyes killer, watches Henry. He nudges
MACE BOONE, (40's), thief previous life.

exaggerated salute.
FITZGERALD

THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR
SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.
TRAPPER

Glass men shove flatboat sandbar... start
scrambling aboard, arrows dart past them... drive

Suddenly WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger

EXT. CAMP - MORNING
Empty quiet... sign life... GLASS' HAND RISES
BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig earth,

Glass cups water mouth, drink,
feels water leak hole throat... run

urge vomit... pulls razor leather bag,
cuts strips blanket, soaking river,
cleaning wounds.
40.
He runs finger shredded throat...
open, wet hole. He cups handful water
mouth... strains swallow, feels liquid GURGLE OUT
OF THE HOLE.
Glass shoves cloth wound... tries press
flesh together... good. He dumps Possibles

flints... looks powderhorn.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS...
...as Glass SPARKS flints... ignites grass.
As grows, Glass pours handful GUNPOWDER
horn, RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT.
He lifts small blades burning grass... miniature
torch. And realize he's do...
stares flame beat, raises
gunpowder-covered throat.
The flame nears black powder, LEAPS OFF THE GRASS,
igniting powder, SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE.
Glass falls ground agony... TRIES TO SCREAM,

The gunpowder sizzles burns... flame spreads...

And Glass' eyes flying open glaring sun, awakens
nightmare... looks arm... snake. His hand
instinctively jumps melted throat. No bites.
But that's hears it... do...
RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns head

Only isn't poised attack Glass. It's facing
way, target FIELD MOUSE, trapped rock.
The snake attacks, sinking fangs mouse. The
field mouse tumbles over... quivers poison runs
body, dies.
As Glass watches snake begin meal mouse,
hand grips rock. He drags occupied
snake... raises rock high, SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE
SNAKE'S HEAD.
Glass immediately pulls razor bag, slices
rattlesnake's head, field mouse lodged
halfway inside. Glass drags razor length
snake... digs fingers fresh seam,
peels outer layer rattler.
With skin hanging round tube flesh,
Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing chunk meat. He
gobbles down, slowing painfully swallow food
past injured throat.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE...
...the head, skin, else.
GLASS - water's edge, drinking... touching

42.
He drags map... spreads ground, throws
glance him... fingers point blue line...
rough guess location.
ANGLE ON THE MAP...
...Fort Union top... hundreds miles north. Fort
Brazeau south... nearly far away.
Glass gazes north Grand, Fitzgerald

reflection water... battered scarred. He
looks leg... worthless now... good

So Glass shoves map bag... ties
arm powderhorn blanket, grabs THICK,
FALLEN LOG, rolls river. Glass crawls

Glass drapes healthy arm log, starts
floating... letting river work. He watches

EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
Winding open prairie. Glass hangs
log... floats gentle current.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING
The sinking sun casts orange glow water. Glass
floats downstream... past HERD OF ELK grazing
riverbank. The animals don't notice him.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
Dark... moon hidden clouds. A heavy mist hangs
river. Glass draped log, eyes
closed... letting slow current carry south. But
eyes open... hears something... LOW RUMBLE.
Glass looks river banks... foggy
clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead...
dark much... ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating
him, jagged branch rising air.
43.
But THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints fog,
scanning surface. But it's gone... water's empty...
LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.
Glass looks water him... BRANCH GLIDES PAST
AT A HIGHER SPEED. And Glass knows what's coming,
it's late... world suddenly turns upside
down, Glass tumbles edge TWENTY FOOT
WATERFALL.
He spirals downward... crashes rushing current.
He's washed forward suddenly violent rapids. They
pull surface, toss GASPING out.
The river carries blindly mist... tossing...
turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK...
spins off, swept away headfirst... foaming water sucking
rocky gauntlet.
He tumbles boulders... Possibles bag snaps
loose... Glass makes grab it, suddenly flipped
set falls.
The Possibles Bag lost raging river.
Glass sinks beneath surface, floats up,
rapids calm... spit Glass gentle shallows. His body
drifts face-down shore.
And we're sure Glass finally dead,
arm reaches water... digs fingers
muddy bank, drags river.
Glass collapses unconscious ground, body shrouded
mist.
EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... right
pressed muddy bank. The sun beats down...
SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... standing

And VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME...
...latches beak Glass' cheek... tugs it...
stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... PULL BACK
THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking clawing
battered wounds.
44.
Glass swings good arm, knocking vultures away.
He tries out, PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS
throat.
The vultures dance away flailing... aren't willing
meal easily... dart quick attacks
flesh.
Glass grasps branch... swings birds, beating
back. The vultures battle... fly away.
Glass crumbles ground... squints
sun... SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM...
waiting die.
Glass looks wounds, oozing blood. He

At base ridge, GIANT BOULDER broken free,
