The Senator watches, amazed, box begins slowly fold

PICARD
You're speaking emotional
investment?
DEANNA
The B-9 like slow child, sir.
And Data, way,

PICARD
As care him,

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
A diplomatic mission. We've

PICARD
New Praetor?
JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
There's more... always. He's

No, I mind.
