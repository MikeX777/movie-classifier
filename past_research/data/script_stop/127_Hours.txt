EXT. CONCERT. NIGHT.
The concert explode life.
THE POP SONG PLAYS OVER:
` A man rise, A man fall...
INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
His face pushing surface. He surges
water, cling elbows pool. No
prosthetic.
SONG CONTINUES OVER:
...From sheer face love
Like fly wall'
CUT TO:
EXT. POOL. DAY.
There grass pool
sofa canyon. On it, friends
family, including Rana. There's

They smile, simple, silent support him. He looks right
them.
THE END
