Tyler watches skyline, WHISTLES tune, waiting.
JACK
(distorted)
Can't off... ?
TYLER
It's hands.
(looks watch)
This it.
JACK
Please...
TYLER
Fifteen seconds now. Can
alright? 10... 9... 8....
Tyler looks windows, SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
excited. Jack closes eyes, despairing.
TYLER
5... 4... 3... 2...
Out window, SKYLINE remains unchanged. Nothing. A
long beat. A dark scowl comes Tyler's face.
Jack opens eyes. More waiting. Tyler looks genuinely
surprised, pissed-off.
TYLER
What fuck -- ?
JACK
Paraffin.
TYLER
What?
JACK
(relieved)
Paraffin. Your merry band mixed
nitro paraffin. I saw
floating bomb.
(more)
JACK (cont)
They must've run cotton
Epsom salt. Paraffin iffy best.
Tyler rises, taking gun Jack's mouth, starts
pacing. Jack rubs sore jowls, allows smile.
TYLER
Damn it! God-damn it...
JACK
Not exactly according plan.
TYLER
Do

Tyler stops walking, lets sigh disgust. He reaches
pocket, taking WALKIE TALKIE.
TYLER
(into WALKIE TALKIE)

Jack's eyes wide.
JACK
NO...
TYLER
(into WALKIE TALKIE)
Proceed remote detonation.
Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler. The GUN knocked away. Jack
STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly elbow, scrambles
off...
Jack gets gun, turns, pointing it. Tyler's getting
feet, sees gun, annoyed. Jack stands.
TYLER
Haven't this?
Jack SHOOTS TWICE. Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
Tyler rolls eyes, drops walkie-talkie
floor STOMPS it, CRUSHING it.
JACK
(pointing)
How'd that?! You're fucking
figment imagination... you're
psychogenic fugue state...
TYLER
Fuck that, maybe you're
hallucination.
Jack falters, pointing Tyler's feet. There's walkie-
talkie there. Jack looks down, sees WALKIE-TALKIE
CRUSHED foot.
JACK
Oh... Christ...
Jack holds head, walks around, wit's end.
JACK
Why... why... why... ?
TYLER
Why what?
JACK
Why can't I rid you? Why
can't I wish away?
TYLER
You need me.
JACK
No, no, I don't.
(pause)
I thank you, I do. Thank you,
I don't need anymore.
TYLER
Look, I selfish, I know that.
(pause)
I'm blind failings...
JACK
Noooo, please...
Jack backs window, numb weary.
TYLER
From on, we'll share Marla.
We've spending time
apart...
JACK

TYLER

JACK
I swear life, I won't...
TYLER
You will. You know will.
Jack stares Tyler, tears welling up, hangs head. He
looks gun hand...
TYLER
Can live that?
Jack stares gun long time... then...
Jack brings gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.
Tyler cocks head.
TYLER
What doing?
JACK
What left me?
TYLER
Why want that? Why

JACK
Not mouth. Our mouth.
Tyler calm.
TYLER

Tyler smiles appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
close Jack.
TYLER
Why going this, Ikea-
boy?
JACK
It's way rid you...
Jack COCKS hammer gun.
TYLER
I feel strongly. I
feel strongly too.
(pause)
Hey, me.
(pause)
Friends again?
Their eyes locked, unblinking. Long silence.
JACK
Do me.
TYLER
What?
JACK
Appreciate something.
TYLER

JACK
Look me...
TYLER

JACK
My eyes open.

Tyler stands, gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs air...
TYLER

OPEN, revealing blood, skull brain.
Suddenly, GROUP SPACE MONKEYS burst room,
moving forward Jack. TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.
TALL SPACE MONKEY

Jack quakes, holding head; ragged hole
blown CHEEK. He's bleeding hard, he's alive.
JACK

Jack looks Space Monkeys, trying eyes

Marla struggles.
SHORT SPACE MONKEY

ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY

Jack sees Marla, tries feet, falls...
JACK
Bring girl me. The rest

The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.
MARLA

JACK

Marla crouches, takes wadded TISSUES tries apply.
Jack's wound. Space Monkeys leaving, hesitantly.
JACK

Jack Marla left alone.
MARLA

JACK
