BODHI
Thanks, brah.
Bodhi doesn't wait reply. He walks water's
edge, looks back. He throws board
foam paddles, riptide pulling out. The
monsters dwarf body quickly suck
trough holocaust.
UTAH stands solemnly waits universe deliver
final justice. The cops running clumsily
sand, late stop Bodhi. Tyler steps
Johnny, puts hands shoulders.
BODHI SPECK shoots
lip colossal wave, carving board downward -- AN
UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends 180 degree
slide straight enormous face, eyes wild,
mouth opens soundless howl -- Bodhi outer-
limits wave locked impossible glorious
moment perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect
union... There fear face, awe
mountain water closes out, burying Bodhisattva
whitewater grave... Pieces broken surfboard explode
upward, fall raging whiteness
vanish.
UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed riderless surf.
Tyler lowers head. A fragment surfboard washes
wet sand. The wind gathers force.
Johnny finally turns woman, curls arm
shoulder, gathering close. Tears streaming
face stares sea.
UTAH
He rode way.
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high heads
liquid vertical walls continue hammer
Australian shore...
FADE TO BLACK
