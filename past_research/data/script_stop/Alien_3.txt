Ripley looks John.
RIPLEY
You left out.
JOHN
The order counter culture,
reaction Technology
beginning everyone's lives.
It simple idea - Read, don't

air. The earliest members
renounced technology. Started collect
remaining books. Nobody
noticed hadn't Virus.
RIPLEY
Your Abbot talked that. The
New Plague.
ANTHONY
A virus. A bad program. By
time Corporate structure
transglobal, world's data storage
systems linked. It spread
countries stopped.
JOHN
After scare like that, thousands flocked
retreat. People started clamoring
written information. For books.
They abandoned modern ways --
RIPLEY
I think I comes out.
They gave possessions.
ANTHONY
This threat --
RIPLEY
To Company.
JOHN
They sold technology. A movement
live simply quickly twisted
Federal agents political movement
Company-controlled World
Government. Too stake.
RIPLEY
Too profit.
JOHN
We sentenced political dissidents.
This orbiter gulag. All men
packed books,
towed space. Ten thousand men. The

RIPLEY
The Company sense irony.
Sending wooden tub.
ANTHONY
I placed sensor.
Keeps tabs movement.
RIPLEY
So how'd you?
ANTHONY
I told them. After supply ship's

John looks embarrassed.
RIPLEY
And I don't know New Plague,
