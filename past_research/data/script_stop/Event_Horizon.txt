Weir enters, escorted Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.
WEIR
You wanted me, Admiral?
HOLLIS
I apologize short notice,
Bill, we've come
requires immediate
attention. Lyle?
INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Lyle activates holographic display solar system. A

INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE
LYLE
At oh-three-hundred morning,
TDRSS picked automated
navigation beacon broadcasting
minute intervals Neptune orbit.
Lyle hands Weir stack hardcopy data. Weir reads
data growing excitement.
WEIR
Incredible... These
coordinates ship
disappeared... this, happened?
This isn't kind hoax?
HOLLIS
I wouldn't bring hoax.
Houston confirms telemetry
I.D. codes.
WEIR
(excited)
It's Event Horizon. She's come
back.
Hollis answers drily.
HOLLIS
That ship lost deep space,
seven years ago. If Titanic sailed
New York harbor, I'd
plausible.
(beat)
Houston wants Aerospace send
search rescue team, investigate
source transmission. If
Event Horizon,
they'll attempt salvage.
(beat)
We need prepare detailed
briefing ship's systems
salvage crew...
WEIR
A written briefing can't possibly
anticipate variables mission
like this. I them.
Lyle looks Weir, stunned request.
LYLE
Dr. Weir, experience
salvage procedures.
WEIR
I designed ship's propulsion
system. I person capable
evaluating performance
gravity drive. You can't send Search
Rescue team
expect succeed. That
like... like sending auto-
mechanic work shuttle.
LYLE
I understand desire redeem
reputation, Dr. Weir,
doesn't factor this.
WEIR
This reputation!
This all!
(beat, passionate)
The Event Horizon created
reason: faster light.
Imagine mankind exploring new solar
systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven
years ago, didn't lose
ship crew. We lost dream.
(beat, quiet
relentless)
I go.
HOLLIS
It's simple.
(off Weir's
expression)
Lyle, play recording Dr.
Weir.
LYLE
Navigation Control tried hail
vessel. This response.
Lyle presses button Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips
office speakers: STATIC NOISE INHUMAN VOICES.
Alone, sound raise hair neck. Together,
unbearable.
The sound mercifully cuts STATIC. Lyle stops tape.
Weir sits there, stunned.
LYLE
Since initial transmission,
there's contact.
Just beacon, minutes.
WEIR
The crew? Could alive?
LYLE
The ship life support systems
eighteen months. They're
gone seven years.
WEIR
Someone sent message. Admiral,
ship.
Hollis stares Weir, judging man eyes.
HOLLIS
It's better judgement,
I'll run Man
downstairs. You'll know decision
end day.
WEIR
Thank you.
HOLLIS
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm
favors.
Weir leaves. The door closes him.
LYLE
You're seriously considering
sending him?
HOLLIS
You don't dismiss Bill Weir.
The man held Oppenheimer's chair
Princeton. If Event Horizon
worked, gone
history greatest mind
physics Einstein.
LYLE
The official inquiry blamed Weir's
design ship's loss.
HOLLIS
That doesn't mean damn thing. They
looking scapegoat
Weir fit bill. But he's
responsible happened
ship.
LYLE
Does know that?
HOLLIS
What's mind?
LYLE
He doesn't belong mission.
Responsible not, blames himself.
He's close it.
(beat)
And there's wife.
HOLLIS
It's years died.
He's it.
LYLE
Some things don't over.

MILLER
And mission specialist Dr.
William Weir. We know we're
going. Dr. Weir going tell
why.
Miller crew look Weir, waiting. Weir clears
throat.
WEIR
What I tell
considered code-black NSA.
The crew look other: haven't heard
mission briefing before.
JUSTIN
That means top-secret, Cooper.
COOPER
I heard it.
WEIR
The USAC intercepted radio
transmission decaying orbit
Neptune. The source
identified Event Horizon.
STUNNED SILENCE. Then talks once:
STARCK
That's impossible! She lost
hands, what, seven...
JUSTIN
Seven years ago, reactor blew...
PETERS
How salvage...?
SMITH
Let dead rest, man...
COOPER
...cancel leave send
bullshit mission...!
MILLER
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let man speak.
In quiet follows:
WEIR
What public Event
Horizon, deep space
research vessel, reactor
went critical, ship blew
up... None true.
(beat)
The Event Horizon culmination
secret government project
create spacecraft capable faster-
than-light flight.
The crew stares Weir: dropped bomb
them.
SMITH
You can't that.
STARCK
The law relativity prohibits faster-
than-light travel...
WEIR
Relativity, yes. We can't break
law relativity,
it. The ship doesn't
faster speed light;
creates dimensional gateway
allows ship
instantaneously "jump" point
universe another, light
years away.
STARCK
How?
WEIR
Well, layman's terms, use
rotating magnetic field focus
narrow beam gravitons;
turn fold space-time consistent
Weyl tensor dynamics space-
time curvature infinitely
large singularity...
COOPER
Laymen's terms.
Weir thinks way explain it. He rips pin-up
Smith's locker.
SMITH
Hey...
WEIR
Say paper represents space-time,
want "point A"
here...
(marks photo
pen)
...to "point B," here.
(marks point B)
Now: what's shortest distance
points?
The crew stares him. Starck decides play.
STARCK
A straight line.
WEIR
Wrong. The shortest distance
points...
Weir folds paper, lining point A point B...
THRUSTING pen both, skewering pin-up.
WEIR
...is zero. That's
singularity does: folds space,
point A point B coexist
space time. After
ship passes gateway,
space returns normal.
(hands ruined pin-
Smith)
It's called gravity drive.
JUSTIN
How know this?
WEIR
I built it.
Even Cooper impressed.
COOPER
I sent along.
JUSTIN
So ship didn't blow up,
happened?
WEIR
It ship's maiden voyage,
test drive. The Event Horizon
moved safe distance ion
thrusters. They received go-ahead
activate gravity drive.
(beat)
And ship vanished
scopes. No radar contact, enhanced
optical, radio contact
kind. They disappeared
trace.
(beat)
Until now.

all, INHUMAN VOICES.
The crew listen, look another. The recording ends
abruptly.
SMITH
What hell that?
PETERS
It doesn't sound like human.
WEIR
Houston passed recording

MILLER
What that?
DJ
It sounds like Latin.
COOPER
Latin? Who fuck speaks Latin?
STARCK
No one. It's dead language.
DJ
Mostly dead.
MILLER

It's 2041...
WEIR
Exactly. The ship's internal clock

WEIR
No, there's evidence surge

MILLER
Explanation?
WEIR
Intense gravitational fields effect
