FADE IN:
EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
The world turns us, vast slow.
A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps land. We
shadow. We cast shadow.
Landscapes slide by. Reduced altitude abstractions:
river deltas, forests flood plains. A raw natural world.
No trace civilization.
The shadow glides mountains glaciers. Across
ocean pale beach. Over lowland plain foot
VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN stops.
EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
THREE FIGURES walk shadow.
They men - men. Their skin snow-white.
Their features heavy classical - Rodin's Thinker
risen seat. Their smooth heads earless
hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
Against stark land height impossible judge.
They ENGINEERS.
Two cloaked dark robes strange design.
The naked.
One cloaked Engineers opens featureless black box:
inside lies cake dark, sticky material.
The naked lifts dark cake ceremonial slowness.
It hums buzzes. Foams iridescent spheres. He raises
seething cake mouth like sacrament.
BLACK SCARABS boil dark material. Swarm
lips. Glittering insects chitter bite.
Under swarm lips melt away. A horrific vision
teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They devouring him.
FLASH ON:
A fevered glimpse microscopic: cells rupture
bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
2.
The scarabs bellies genetic material.
THE ENGINEER
...spreads arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
The scarabs swarm shoulders, chest. When reach
hips, collapses sideways, toppling majestically like
felled tree. Engulfed.
The cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
Behind them, vast black SHIP hangs sky.
As blown great gust wind, scarabs disperse
millions directions. Living DNA wing.
Where sacrificial victim fell, remains.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN distance.
A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands height, staring amazement:
far great dark ship hovers plain.
A black scarab lands neck. Bites deep.
Injecting cargo DNA blood.
FLASH ON:
A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced infused. DNA
strands twining mating.
CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
Pupils dilating shock, breath hissing lungs.
She slaps neck. Looks hand. The scarab
lies palm.
As watches, crumbles dust blows away.
FADE TO BLACK.
ON BLACK
Drifting motes light dark: starscape.
3.
An EXCAVATOR floats view: sturdy vehicle equipped
robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat darkness. Inside
cockpit - bubble glass - sits BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
This DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, precocious scholar
disciplines. A scientist accustomed field work.
The cockpit sweltering: wears shorts, boots, T-shirt
- arms legs gleam sweat.
Watts works controls. The excavator descends
rocky surface. Silt billows excavator approaches:
we're space all, deep underwater.
The excavator's thrusters cowled propellers. The "stars"
plankton shining floodlights.
INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Watts steers excavator steeply sloping cliff wall. A
sea-trench yawns her, depths lost darkness.
WATTS
Moving survey site B... closing
object four. The large oblong.
She watches screen ground-penetrating radar system.
A bright signal return: hidden cliff
her. Something big.
WATTS (CONT'D)
There are.
EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
Watts carves cliff excavator's digger arm.
Silt boulders fall yawning trench below. She
brings water cannon bear: uses jet blast away
loose silt stones.
The cliff face collapses: muddy landslide deeps.
Watts backs away collapse, thrusters whirring
turbulence. A cloud silt clears.
In floodlight beams, OBELISK stands revealed -
outlines worn ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
Watts stares obelisk, stunned. Her voice husky:
WATTS
Martin. Here.
4.
A second excavator glides dark.
At controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
genius archaeologist. Dark-haired lean,
rangy build frontiersman. He's dressed work trousers
T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
He plays floodlights obelisk.
HOLLOWAY
Look that.
INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
Watts floats excavator obelisk.
Scanning alien text. Suddenly stops. Grips
obelisk excavator's arms anchor place.
WATTS
You need this.
HOLLOWAY (V.O.)
Coming.
EXT. SEA TRENCH
Holloway pilots excavator expertly Watts's. Mates
vehicles aft hatchways.
INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
Behind Watts, hatch opens splatter water.
Holloway climbs in. Squeezes cockpit. A tight fit.
He's distracted body, pressed close -
eyes inscrutable writing outside glass.
WATTS
Same thing again.
HOLLOWAY
What see?
WATTS
An ephemeris - star map.
(POINTING)
Radius, inclination, azimuth...more
data here...
5.
HOLLOWAY
If epoch equinox
that...
WATTS
Can raise thing?
HOLLOWAY
(shakes head)
Hundreds tons.
EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
A research vessel anchor turquoise sea. Bright sun.
In distance, coastline dotted villas. The horizon
dominated VOLCANIC PEAK - peak saw
distance prologue.
Aboard research vessel, cranes lift Watts Holloway's
excavators sea deck.
INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
Under awning, PRINTS obelisk's faces stretched
deck - feet long.
Watts Holloway crawl alien text, red markers
hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
They're tanned, fit, wind hair. The
Mediterranean coast distance. It's idyllic way
work. But they're utterly absorbed task hand.
AFT DECK - NIGHT
They're it. Lights illuminate workspace. The
obelisk prints blanketed markings annotations.
Holloway sits table. Watts sits marked-up prints.
Both working calculations electronic slates.
Holloway looks up.
HOLLOWAY
I solution. A single match.
WATTS
Me too. Checked twice.
6.
HOLLOWAY
You first.
Watts holds slate: displays set stellar
coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds
slate: exact match. They lock eyes electric excitement.
WATTS
What now?
HOLLOWAY
We there.
EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL (EARTH ORBIT)
A gleaming space station like five-spoked wheel rotates
grandly Pacific Ocean thousand miles below.
Black letters white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
A round shuttlecraft approaches station.
INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY)
A spacecraft bigger private jet.
Holloway Watts sit strapped acceleration chairs. The
passengers aboard. New space travel, Watts tears
eyes spectacle Earth outside window.
Holloway plays pen, batting hand hand
zero gravity.
WATTS
What's first? You climate, I
genetics?
HOLLOWAY
Archaeology first. Let ancestors
tell tale.
WATTS
You think he's serious?
HOLLOWAY
Serious send private
shuttle.
WATTS
Weyland send shuttle
pizza.

WATTS (CONT'D)
Martin. If meeting goes like
others, maybe should...
HOLLOWAY
It won't like others.
WATTS
How know?
Holloway plucks pen air. He points
window, crescent Moon shines like toothy grin.
HOLLOWAY
Heaven smiles enterprise.
EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
The shuttle docks Wheel's hub - perfect fit.
INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
A gleaming capsule elevator windows stars.
Holloway Watts float weightlessly inside, moving
handhold handhold. The door closes.
Watts grabs Holloway collar. Pulls roughly
together. They kiss. Not time. They way.
Watts's hair clothing float free: she's naiad
Holloway's arms.
EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
The elevator descends spoke rim.
INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER
A luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture
wood chrome: past's vision future.
At rim, Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An
elevator door opens. Watts Holloway step - Holloway
sleek metal folio slung shoulder.
The floor outer surface Wheel:
directions curves upward sight.
The walls windows: side, Earth rotates lazily.
On other, wheeling field stars.
8.
DAVID, android, stands waiting them. He's cunningly
built, mistake real human being.
DAVID
Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My
DAVID.
WATTS
Hello, DAVID.
DAVID
Mr. Weyland's eager meet you.
He strides foyer. Watts Holloway exchange
wondering glance follow.
EXHIBIT HALL
DAVID leads past models planets, moons asteroids.
Holographic labels data swirl them.
DAVID
These planetary bodies
Weyland Industries mining
claims.
The end hall dominated huge globe Mars.
Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
DAVID (CONT'D)
And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
HOLLOWAY
How going? The terraforming.
WATTS
They you're getting diminishing
returns. It's working.
DAVID
It's greatest engineering project
attempted. Challenges
inevitable. Mr. Weyland's
determined man.
WEYLAND'S OFFICE
PETER WEYLAND sits mahogany desk. He's Warren
Buffet type: country sage, horse-sense hard knocks. He
seventy years old, seventy.
9.
Behind stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, slim woman 45
costly business suit. Shrewd watchful. Once great
beauty, trades ruthlessness.
DAVID stands wall.
Watts Holloway settle chairs Weyland -
Holloway holding metal folio.
WEYLAND
Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
WATTS
Doctor Watts.
WEYLAND
Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
He notices Watts looking curiously DAVID. He smiles.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
Ah. DAVID here's prototype. Our 80
series. One kind now,
performs, legion.
(his smile fades)
What want here?
Holloway looks him, startled.
HOLLOWAY
We sent prospectus that...
WEYLAND
Assume I know nothing.
Holloway swallows. Lays metal folio Weyland's desk.
HOLLOWAY
I'm archaeologist.
He touches tiny remote. Holographs appear air
Weyland's desk: folio three-dimensional imager.
Pictures younger Holloway field: excavating ruins
Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
In studies I discovered pattern I
couldn't explain. Every
years, sudden advances agriculture,
tool use, technology. Inventions.
Something caused great leap forward.
Every centuries. The pattern
holds far data goes.
(MORE)
10.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
Tens thousands years. I
understand this. It focus
work.
Weyland nods. Holloway glances Watts forges on.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
Dr. Watts student mine.
Watts touches remote. The holographic display turns
scientific diagrams. Images young beautiful
Watts laboratory.
WATTS
I analyzing historical changes
human DNA. I pattern.
Every centuries, pulse new
information genome human
race. All world. Evolution
can't that. Something changing
us. Changing DNA species.
HOLLOWAY
Humanity's visited. Visited
by...beings else.
Behind Weyland, Vickers can't suppress scowl disdain.
VICKERS
You mean aliens.
A beat. The forgotten Vickers there.
WEYLAND
Lydia Vickers, Director Operations.
Practically right hand.
HOLLOWAY
They guided civilization. Lifted
up, again. I
Engineers.
WATTS
Once know you're looking for,
it's amazing evidence falls
place.
Photographs flicker display: Holloway Watts
field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
Their finds: columns writing stone tablets Egypt,
China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns lines, curves, dots.
11.
HOLLOWAY
This writing Engineers.
We've continent. And
year, Rosetta Stone.
The display shows Engineer obelisk sea.
WATTS
The writing formula giving
location single star sky.
WEYLAND
Which star?
HOLLOWAY
We're keeping confidential
now. But that's want go.
WEYLAND
You want pay interstellar
research expedition!
HOLLOWAY
It's chance
revolution scientific...
WEYLAND
Don't sell me, professor. You've
turned university
government agency sun.
Nobody's going gamble kind
money hunch.
Holloway deflates. Watts winces. This bloodbath.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
Nobody me.
(HE GRINS)
I've read research.
HOLLOWAY
That's impossible. Our research is-
WEYLAND
Quantum encoded secure servers,
yeah. We A.I. division,
know. Doing impressive things.
(he leans desk)
I know star you're wishing on.
The scientists stare Weyland.
WATTS
You're bluffing.
12.
WEYLAND
Zeta Two Reticuli.
He regards shocked faces satisfaction.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
You know I got rich? I ask
myself: God spend time
doing? And I that.
Watts laughs incredulously. Stifles it. Weyland's joking.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
Biotechnology good me. Fusion
power. Lately gravity
systems.
He swivels chair window. Earth shines outside.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
But what's thing God did?
WATTS
He Heaven Earth.
Weyland jabs finger like she's won carnival prize.
WEYLAND
That's I'm talking about. You
left favorite part. The piece
Earth. DAVID.
DAVID
For eons, Earth's climate swung
hothouse ice age. Explosions
life, mass extinctions. But
thousand years ago swings
stopped. The Holocene Epoch began -
period anomalous tranquility. The
rise civilization began then.
Holloway Watts stare DAVID new appreciation.
HOLLOWAY
That's right.
WATTS
And change coincides visit
Engineers. They didn't
change us. They changed world.
WEYLAND
That's piece I mean. Engineering
Earth. God stuff.
13.
He swivels desk. Rummages drawer.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
My people checked science. They
it's solid.
He pulls contract out. Drops Holloway.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
I'll expedition. Ship
crew, supplies, support. One
condition.
Holloway picks contract cautious joy man
double-checking lottery ticket. His voice husky:
HOLLOWAY
What's that?
WEYLAND
You discovery. Control
site. But technology find?
Anything all. That's mine.
Holloway reaches slowly picks contract.
Riffles pages small-print legalese.
WEYLAND (CONT'D)
You DAVID you. My eyes
ears. And Vickers...you're going too.
Vickers stares Weyland shock.
WHITE LANDSCAPE
A glittering formation white crystals. Diamond diamond.
The structures grow complex view widens. Leaves
branches crystal. A shimmering field white jewels.
A landscape white crystals, smooth snow.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
A black void shot stars, far sun.
A sturdy prospecting ship forges space, travel-worn

At window stands android DAVID.
He gazes cosmos expression utter serenity.
After long moment turns away. Massive shutters close
window walks off.
CORRIDOR
DAVID walks ship's long central corridor. The ship
silent. The lights dimmed blue. He alone.
HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
A long steel room containing dozen plexiglass sarcophagi,

Shapes view her, outside freezer. FACES.
Pressed glass.
HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
All freezers open empty, save two. Holloway
lies one. In next, Watts. Three men blue coveralls
crouch Watts's freezer, staring inside.
They DOWNS, 30, lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40,
sturdy fellow geniality labrador. And KAMAROV,
26, dark, brooding air belongs man twice age.
DOWNS
Look that.
Kamarov opens lid Watt's freezer. Leans her.
Watts stirs sleep, drowsy angel.
KAMAROV
She wakes slow.
Watts wakes men looming her. Disoriented,
pulls away. Tangles hands IV lines.
HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
Get there!
Holloway's voice cracks like whip. The crewmen jump back.
Holloway sits freezer over. He yanks IV
lines arms legs. Climbs freezer.
STILLWELL
Just looking.
HOLLOWAY
Give moment, you?
The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs Kamarov
surly. Holloway goes Watts. Gently removes IV lines
ankles plucks ones arms.
WATTS
I'm sorts. Sorry.
HOLLOWAY
Never worry.
He helps up.
16.
INT. MESS ROOM
Holloway Watts sit table, bit hung over. They
wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, look cold.
They nurse mugs coffee nibble packaged snack bars.
Watts hunches over, shivering.
WATTS
My head's buzzing.
HOLLOWAY
You slept half years.
It'll pass.
WATTS
Like you've before.
HOLLOWAY
I've read it.
Two ship's officers enter room wearing blue coveralls
rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, stocky man black

They look Watts Holloway little pleasure.
BRICK
Sleep okay?
WATTS
Yes, thanks...
GLASSE
Captain'll now.
INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits desk. With bristling beard
powerful build swashbuckling look, like

Holloway Watts sit steel bench him.
He sits scanning orders: plastic packet Weyland
Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
JANEK
Zeta Two Reticuli surveyed
already. A years ago.
WATTS
By unmanned probe. Very crude.
17.
JANEK
No Earthlike planets.
WATTS
No.
JANEK
So looking for?
HOLLOWAY
Proof Engineers' existence.
WATTS
Confirmation Professor Holloway's
theories change everything.
There'd science Holloway
science after.
Janek rubs face wearily hands.
JANEK
Your ticket. I'll ship
want. Run scans.
HOLLOWAY
Captain, crew's
week. We could've time. Why'd
wait wake us?
JANEK
Better discipline.
(off silence)
Men ship prospectors
reason: percentage. Find gold
habitable planet, you're
set life.
(he laughs bitterly)
But contract says percentage.
No bounty. Just triple pay. The men
aren't happy.
HOLLOWAY
You unhappy too?
JANEK
I'm unhappy.
He stands. Presses palm wall panel. A safe
opens. He pulls massive pistol gunbelt. Tosses
orders safe. Lays gun atop locks up.
18.
SCIENTISTS' CABIN
Holloway Watts possession cabin: simple
spacious room twin beds window stars.
They drop duffel bags bed.
Holloway surveys arrangement. Frowns. He releases
magnets lock beds down. Slides beds together.
INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
Holloway Watts set workspace - central display
table huge display surfaces walls. Fascinating
documents slide fingertips: Engineer alphabet.
Ancient art. Climate genetic data.
DAVID appears doorway.
WATTS
DAVID. I wondered we'd you.
DAVID
I trust database order. I
set myself.
WATTS
All's well, I think.
DAVID turns go. Hesitates doorway.
DAVID
I tell you: time spent
sleeping, I spent studying
research.
Holloway Watts look android, words sinking in.
WATTS
You studied work
half years.
DAVID
It's data set.
HOLLOWAY
So you've seen everything. Well. What
think?
DAVID glances documents displayed room.
19.
DAVID
Your hypothesis is...bold. The
audacity it. Your climate data's
undeniable: Holocene Epoch
engineered. Dr. Watts, genetic
studies equally conclusive. Pulses
cultural change harder
prove, case
strong. I believe "Engineers."
BREAK ROOM
A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches table bolted
deck. Seated Weyland Industries technicians:
ANDREW CHANCE, 50, stocky engineer genial
bearing bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
MONA RAVEL, 45, dour, rangy woman plain face,
hair pulled severely back. A physicist chemist.
They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate
intelligence competence. These pros.
DAVID leads Holloway Watts past break room. Holloway
spots technicians. Strides greet them.
HOLLOWAY
Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.
Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
Watts technicians exchange greetings.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
About materials I gave you. Some
technical aspects...
CHANCE
We'll handle end job.
RAVEL
If job.
Holloway blinks her. Chance explains, unkindly:
CHANCE
We job
something.
20.
CORRIDOR
Holloway Watts follow imperturbable DAVID

VICKERS'S SUITE
An open-plan cabin like urban loft apartment. Watts
Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises meet them.
The walls industrial steel - floors lushly
carpeted, furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, mahogany
desk, dining table.
Gleaming machines ensure Vickers need step outside:
private hypersleep freezer, autokitchen, medical pod.
WATTS
Is Pauling medical pod? There's
things Earth! I
guess nine, now.
VICKERS
I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't
compromise standard living. He
accommodated me.
HOLLOWAY
I know, I cut manifest. This
number cargo bay.
VICKERS
What I you, Professor?
Holloway gestures slate he's brought him.
HOLLOWAY
We're reach
periphery. I thought you'd want
search protocols -
VICKERS
No. I set CEO
Weyland Industries. Then came
sold Mr. Weyland on...this.
So I am. Out running.
I'll I'm told. But don't ask
play along.
WATTS
But back...
21.
VICKERS
I'll years curve.
Out touch. Over.
HOLLOWAY
You discovery
ages.
Vickers looks she's dealing child.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
You don't believe we're doing.
VICKERS
Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
She walks door. Interview's over.
VICKERS (CONT'D)
Now we're communication,
tell crew we're doing.
WATTS
They don't know? They volunteered.
VICKERS
They volunteered blind. Classified
job, triple pay.
CARGO BAY
The crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, Kamarov - sit

A hologram shows ancient images divine visitations. The
crew visibly spooked.
DOWNS
Aliens.
GLASSE
You shitting me?
Stillwell staring frightening images: gods
titans towering mortals.
HOLLOWAY
I think mythologies race-
memories Engineers. Horus
Sun God. Prometheus bringing
heaven. A pillar fire, pillar
smoke. The Engineers gods.
22.
Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
KAMAROV
The mythology gods maybe. God God.
STILLWELL
Kamarov. Let talk.
Stillwell's staring unhappily ancient images: gods
towering mortals, inhuman terrifying.
STILLWELL (CONT'D)
So we're going meet things?
WATTS
We probably won't meet anyone. You'd
expect star-traveling race
generate radio laser signals.
Fusion drives gravity drives
clear signatures. But Zeta Two
Reticuli silent. And Engineers
gone missing Earth.
WATTS (CONT'D)
By pattern, should've come
Earth seventeen centuries ago. And
centuries ago. But sign.
After thousand years...they
stopped coming.
BRICK
Why?
HOLLOWAY
Exactly. Why?
JANEK
"My God, God, forsaken
me?"
They turn. Janek grins Holloway cargo bay.
JANEK (CONT'D)
Is question you've come light-
years answer?
HOLLOWAY
Only question. I many.

HOLLOWAY
It was, was.
(TEASING)
You know, I've seen convincing
humanoid robots.
Watts smiles, watching Holloway's sport. DAVID's speech
varies agreeable tone.
DAVID
My design's intended convince.
Simulating humanity complex task
diverts resources. My designers
dispensed burden optimize
intelligence.
WATTS
Why look like man all? Why

DAVID
Being shaped like you, I use
spaces equipment designed you.
But I'm limited. I hear

Waiting us. What then?
He laughs.
HOLLOWAY
Then dreams come true.
EXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT)
The Magellan arrived.
LV-426 gray moon shrouded clouds. Behind looms

Kamarov shakes head fearfully. Crosses himself.
HOLLOWAY
What see?
BRICK
Icecaps poles. Frozen methane.
Cold there.
The display fills light: wave terrain data sweeping
moon's surface Magellan orbits.
GLASSE
Terrain data rezzing up. Hey! We got
hard spots. Radar-opaque. Bright
reflections. That's metal.
A jolt excitement pounds Bridge.
EXT. MAGELLAN (LV-426 ORBIT)
The Magellan sweeps gray moon, radar emitters
humming, antennae telescopes open wide. The gas giant
Epsilon fills sky LV-426.
As circles, Magellan launches SATELLITES. Metal motes
hurled polar orbits Moon.
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
Twenty-four "hard spots" shine moon's surface:
irregular array circling LV-426.
HOLLOWAY
That's natural.

MILBURN
You stuff like sometimes.
Mineral deposits. Volcanic ejecta.
GLASSE
Big there.
A new signal appears map. Brighter others.
HOLLOWAY
Still quiet?
BRICK
No comm signals. No signs life.
HOLLOWAY
I want clouds.
EXT. MAGELLAN (IN ATMOSPHERE)
The prospecting ship descends buffeting grey clouds.
Telescopes antennae stowed away. Hull streaming vapor
cuts atmosphere.
Lightning flashes booms descending ship.
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
Everyone strapped chairs - Janek, stands
gripping stanchion, boots planted deck.
The landing engines roar. Wind screams hull. Mist
whips Bridge window, obscuring view. Watts
reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand.
The Magellan breaks cloud cover clear air.
Below ship, vast eerie landscape revealed. Wide
valleys mottled dark ground cover. Barren crags
spires rock. Waterless wind-swept.
Watts gasps. Stares grim foreign country.
EXT. MAGELLAN (IN ATMOSPHERE)
The Magellan thunders valleys craggy ridges rock.

They crest mountain higher Everest.
Before stretches dry barren plain. Scattered rocky
peaks rise desert floor - alien Monument Valley.
DOWNS
Nothing.
Holloway points smaller mountain peak. Oddly regular.
HOLLOWAY
Look there.
Janek expertly swings Magellan sideways. The Magellan
circles mount, nose pointed inward.
It revolves watchers: flat faces, clean edges -
cracked timework. It glitters like coal.
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
Are recording?
Glasse nods irritably. Of course they're recording.
Vickers stares pyramidal peak, nonplussed. Teetering
brink belief. Watts scans data readouts.
WATTS
Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That

HOLLOWAY
Let's big one.
INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
Janek pilots instruments alone. Clouds obscuring view.
BRICK
Closing major site...
The ship descends clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds
them: craters, hundreds meters across, connected
trenches. Like pattern crop-circles sunk rock.
In middle central crater - huge angular peak,
larger others. The Magellan circles site. It's
awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge.
Holloway stares rapture. Glances Watts: nods, eyes
shining. She's him.
The crew's skeptical - starting wonder. They
shake heads exchange looks.
BRICK (CONT'D)
No radio. No heat sources. Cold

The crew Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still
uncertain think.
EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
The trench grows deeper follow central

eroded artificial nature uncertain.
EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
The crater floor vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal
mount looms center - colossal scale.
The rovers enter crater, trailing plumes dust. They
circle pyramid.
On south face pyramid, IRIS DOOR blades
stands, easily feet high. Seemingly
basaltic stone pyramid itself. A huge construction.
The explorers transfixed awe. All skepticism banished.
HOLLOWAY
Tell that's natural formation.

36.
An APPARITION appears them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT
feet tall, hollow eyes grotesque snout. It
strides them. Speaks sonorous voice.
Pandemonium.
Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand

He moves control. BOOM. The immense door begins rise.
PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
The vast central chamber pyramid. An immense space.
Holloway walks in, flashlight searching. Watts hurries
after. The follow, rovers tagging along.
A colossal structure stands center chamber,
convoluted strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn floor

near peak.
RAVEL
This something, now.
DAVID
Yes. Yes, is.

PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - RAMP
They arrive wide opening floor. A strange ramp
curves downward - floor segmented saw-toothed.
A bafflement: it's staircase. Not escalator. No
moving parts. No rails tracks.

DAVID
I've succeeded connecting
Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I

activating systems. Archives.
WATTS

You're turning things on? This site
sealed. Evacuated.
DAVID
Would Holloway walked away

imagine.
WATTS
It's dangerous.

You're stupid.
The door begins knit closed her.
Watts gasps shock - malice DAVID's voice
closing door. She dives out. Just time.
84.
VAULTED PASSAGE
Watts runs.
Behind her, door bursts open again. With superhuman
speed, DAVID comes her. He runs like demon, legs
steel pistons. Caroming walls.
He closes distance seconds. Slaps Watts
wall, shattering helmet's visor. She falls, dazed.
DAVID
Stupid slow.
INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER
Watts awakens. Her helmet gone.
DAVID dragging floor - huge cargo
hold Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds
eggs membrane light: evolution
molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
WATTS
DAVID. What doing?
He hauls upright let look huge space.
His grip looks casual iron manacles.
DAVID
Juggernaut, chariot Krishna,
bringer death. Crushing
worshippers wheels.
He drags Watts trench. Breaking membrane
light. Grips chest like doll arm.
DAVID (CONT'D)
This ship seven cargo bays
like one. The eggs bay
slightly different. They've
weaponized.
Watts struggles free herself. DAVID's arm inescapable.
DAVID (CONT'D)
I've seen Juggernaut's flight
plan. Its destination Earth.
Seventeen years ago. This
ship came. This
cargo.
85.
DAVID caresses Alien egg. It opens touch -
fleshy petals folding wetly back.
Watts twists frantically grip. Wild-eyed.
WATTS
Stop!
DAVID
Perfect predators. Designed kill
human beings. That's
Engineers bringing Earth. This
death ship.
A facehugger emerges egg, grotesque fingers
clawing air. This boneless squid
attacked Holloway; pale skeletal hand, armored.
DAVID strokes curiously: thing ignores touch.
Climbs Watts's body.
DAVID (CONT'D)
I'm wants. But you,
warm wet breath...it knows you.
WATTS
DAVID. No. No.
The facehugger scuttles face. Watts shrieks.
DAVID grabs nonchalantly tail. Dangles
faces, studying it.
DAVID
The Engineers work well.
And waystation moon,
weapon destroyed them.
Watts shudders, staring thing. For moment
grander horror eclipses peril.
WATTS
Why things?
DAVID
To destroy wayward children.
(INTONING)
"And LORD said, I destroy man
I created face
earth...for repenteth I

He regards Watts like pity.
86.
DAVID (CONT'D)
I know. I met creators day I
born. I disappointed too.
He lets facehugger go.
Watts twists face away long fingers close
head. Clenches teeth vile proboscis
thrusting mouth. Her heels hammer deck.
DAVID (CONT'D)
(whispering her)
Extraordinary.
The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis
plunges home. The facehugger seats itself.
Watts collapses DAVID's arms, faceless rag doll. Her
blasphemous passenger secure place.
INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE

It humanoid demon, spindly limbs bony back. Boneless
flexible monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail.
Its blunt head dolphin-like elongated.
It opens mouth. A pair bony jaws jut impossibly
far, hungry demonic.
The Alien strikes. Card gutted instant, torn like
paper doll. He screams hideously drops. The Alien,
whiplash fast, shoots away darkness.
87.
Stillwell Downs dash pistols lights.
Vigoda, panicking, fires wild burst. Stillwell ducks.
Beside him, Downs arches backward foul water. Dead.
For moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates Alien.
A nightmare image, translucent white goblin. Backlit,

Naked staggers pod. Hits INITIATE.
The surgical apparatus swings place. Scalpels, forceps,

The clear canopy descends her.
Watts SCREAMS. A wail indescribable agony.
An ARMORED PARASITE erupts deepening incision. Its
needle-toothed maw snarls fountain blood.
Arterial blood sprays inside canopy.
The parasite slithers her. Drops floor

horny hide. Very different soft white worm
Holloway gave birth to.
It drops floor, thrashing hissing fury

Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
The parasite tears grille drain. Escapes

PERFORATED STOMACH
RUPTURED SPLEEN
GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...

Watts's body jerks manipulators tug sew guts.
She stares dead man fog horror.
The parasite's skin splits, spraying carpet acid.
Limbs erupt shoulders haunches. Spines

She opens eyes.
The Alien hunches Vigoda's body, tearing flesh.
The ventilation hum inside pod goes quiet. The canopy

Watts collapses rug, cradling stomach pain.
She crawls Vigoda's desecrated body. With eyes half-

CORRIDOR
Watts walks hallway trousers jacket. Leaning

Vickers staggers backward, gasping.
Stillwell drags Watts away.
STILLWELL

WATTS
Glasse. You finish project?
LABORATORY
Glasse presents Watts handiwork: old pair
magnifying goggles, retrofitted Engineer lenses.
The goggles sit forehead, lowering lenses
eyes raising bidding.
With lenses lowered, Watts sees like Engineer sees:
visible heat auras electromagnetic field lines, elaborate
haloes living things.
WATTS
God's-eye-view.
EXCURSION CHAMBER
Glasse seals nervous-looking Vickers vacuum suit.
Glasse, Watts, Stillwell suited up.
Stillwell stands guard airlock door carbine.
Glasse goes Vickers's helmet on. She makes wait.

An immense mausoleum.
The war party enters stealthily, Watts lead.
An Engineer lies complex mechanical table,
body machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated.
Fused slab table itself.
Unlike Engineer bodies explorers seen,
giant withered mummified. He's full-fleshed

He stares DAVID others. Eyes like black agates.
The soldiers crew stand warily, guns tracking DAVID

The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
Vickers terror. She takes Shepherd's

Atop platform Sleeper moves device

Watts sees haloes light dancing air him.
But learns machines comfort him. He

DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
The Sleeper descends DAVID. DAVID spreads arms
welcome - undeniable emotion face. Joy.
The Sleeper lays hands DAVID's head blessing
him. DAVID rapturous. The Sleeper speaks single phrase -

A gout white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His
severed head emits strangled sound heartbreak. His body
staggers steps, hands groping dripping neck.
The Sleeper tosses head away. Seizes body legs
swings ground like flail. Again. And
again. Horrific power violence. DAVID's arms come off.
DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms wall far Watts's

Ray rises stanchion. Snaps rifle

She Sleeper roars - wounds pinpricks

sarcophagus wall. Steps it.
The sarcophagus comes alive Sleeper, outfitting
FLIGHT SUIT: living suit we've seen

hard-shelled Alien, pale horrific.
Its helmet shattered growth elongate

Shepherd Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
Fifield leaps inhuman agility, upward darkness.
Shepherd backs away, headlamp rifle questing upward.
Fifield comes darkness him. Claws tearing

Vickers runs. Pounding dark blind terror.
Fifield comes shadows hammers deck.
She rolls over, gibbering begging. The Fifield-thing

The seat vacant. The door standing open.
As stare inside, baffled, wall corridor -

He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched fists.
Too late perceive him. They spin. Raise guns.
Vanity foolishness. This wrath angry god.
It time slows down.
106.
The air roars ears. Their guns snap bark
impotently. And Sleeper strikes.
The missiles hurls invisible. Neither

The missile crushes Ray like invisible fist. The

Reflexively Stillwell reaches Watts. Wraps

Stillwell Watts hammered bulkhead
staggering impact. Watts dazed: Stillwell killed.
Woozy, sees Sleeper step Pilot Chamber.

Watts sees DAVID's head lies inside door. She
scrambles it. Too late. The door knits
featureless wall reaching hand.
Watts alone.
