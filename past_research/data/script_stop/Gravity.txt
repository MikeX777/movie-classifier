GRAVITY
BLACK-
OUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE-
PLANET EARTH.
Like images Earth seen space, image
planet mythical majestic.
The globe tangible, slowly spinning, floating
endless void space. It blue planet, bright white
clouds twirl stretch capricious patterns deep
blue oceans jigsaw continents: green, yellow
brown.
It noon Cape Town early night India.
The sphere perfect orb darkened
sliver Eastern edge.
It beautiful! And life.
But here.
Here completely silent.
SILENCE-
IN THE DISTANCE-
A small metal object crosses space surrounding Earth.
If appears small satellite
far away us. It size football field. It is-
The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).
It resembles dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like
wings, long body connected pressurized modules.
It floats sense proud achievement.
It orbits altitude 500 sea level. It moves
average 27,700 kilometers hour, completing 15.7 laps
Earth day.
It cruising Zimbabwe. To East, island
Madagascar. Up North, expansive dry lands Somalia
Ethiopia.
Soon, ISS curves spherical planet,
smaller, indistinguishable, small bright
spec grazing blue atmosphere.
CLOSER TO US-
Orbiting altitude 600 km-
The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE visible.
This icon space exploration played key role
NASA's missions late 90's.

Okay. Pretty scary shit
untethered here, isn't it?
RYAN
Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
MATT
(after beat)
You right.
Silence.
MATT (CONT'D)
(to Shuttle)
Houston, blind. This
Kowalsky. Our current location

Specialist Shariff return
Shuttle. Am I retrieve?
Silence.
MATT (CONT'D)
Roger that.
Matt changes direction approaches Shariff. He ignite
small thrusts try steady direction, fighting
Ryan's momentum.
RYAN
Where he? Where he?
Shariff's body tethered PANEL ripped away
Explorer. Matt approaches panel ignites
thrusters slow course, and-
He grabs it. Ryan, continuing momentum, crashes
Shariff's body. The contact slows trajectory, throws
Shariff away, tether tensing, pulling panel him.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Matt, holding metal, spins it. He detaches
Shariff's tether panel attaches himself.
He lets panel immediately ignites thruster,
pulling tethers which, tense, bring
Ryan Shariff closer together.
MATT
Grab him!
RYAN
I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT
Quick. You're pulling away.
RYAN
I got him. I got him.
Matt tries ignite long thrust direction
Shuttle, difficult momentum
bodies pulls directions.
MATT
Clutch like he's Valentine. I
can't gauge thrust yo-
yoing around.
Tentatively Ryan extends right hand grab Shariff's
body harness. And sees-
Shariff's broken helmet. A hole size soft ball pierces
left tunnel frozen dried bloody mess.
Ryan's face inscrutable. Finally looks away,
time arrests gaze:
A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats Shariff, tethered
suit small chain. In it, YOUNG BOY LAUGHS abandon,
happy embrace man unseen save TWO STRONG
ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan unable look away,
complicated confusing eyes.
The photograph floats space Planet Earth.
OUTER SPACE.
As approach, damage Shuttle apparent.
Explorer badly hit.
MATT
(under breath)
Jesus...
The Shuttle suffered devastating damage. The tail
repair, wing completely destroyed,
waffles weakly, nearly sheared fuselage.
MATT (CONT'D)
(GRIMLY)
Here's hoping you've got monster
insurance policy, Houston. Damages
Explorer are... it's totaled. Will
commence search survivors.
RYAN
02 percent.
Matt thrusts slow trajectory slowly bumps
windshield COCKPIT.
At mercy Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard nose
Shuttle, losing grip Shariff.
As caroms off, grabs left cockpit's
window.
MATT
All right, go. Careful
edges.
Matt takes flashlight looks broken windows,
lighting cockpit.
Ryan pulls looks-
THROUGH THE WINDOW-
The cabin destroyed. A disarray objects, smashed
devastated.
At end cabin, floating objects, lifeless
body drifts wreckage. Ryan regards silently,
mesmerized.
BANG.
The face second astronaut appears right Ryan
crashes visor.
The eyes frozen, unblinking. Ryan GASPS, wheeling backward
away.
Matt clicks Shariff's harness Shuttle.
MATT (CONT'D)
Houston, blind. To confirm.
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone

Kowalsky, sole survivors
STS-157.
Matt turns Ryan, staring dead astronauts
inside.
RYAN
I apologize complying. I
should've stopped working soon
instructed to.
MATT
We going hit matter
what. There could've
change that.
He begins reach out, hesitates briefly, lightly touches
shoulder.
MATT (CONT'D)
Hey.
RYAN
Yes?
She turns, elbows time.
MATT
Alright... We
Space Station. There.
Matt gestures vaguely bright dot distance.
MATT (CONT'D)
It's bit hike, it's
only...
(CATCHING HIMSELF)
It's best option. Agreed?
She stares dot.
MATT (CONT'D)
Dr. Stone...
(as turns)
Agreed?
She studies face then, finally, nods.
RYAN
Agreed.
MATT
Alright. After you.
He gently pushes space. She slowly drifts away
Explorer suddenly stopped safety tether.
Matt ignites propellers and, giving couple small
thrusts, combats Ryan's swing. And LONGER THRUST-
He shoots forward, pulling Ryan him.
The astronauts push forward together, leaving
shell Shuttle remains Hubble.
MATT (CONT'D)

THE SUN IS RISING.
WATCHING THE SUNRISE
THE SUN looks brighter clearer outside Earth's

MATT
We're getting there.
MATT (CONT'D)
Beautiful, don't think?
RYAN
What?
MATT
The sunrise. That's I'm going
miss most.
But Ryan view right now. She's stricken
fear. Her jaw clenched eyes closed.
Matt looks dark emptiness engulfs smiles.
MATT (CONT'D)
So, where's home, Dr. Stone?
Ryan keeps eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying
DISTRACT HER-
MATT (CONT'D)
Ryan. Where's home?
Ryan opens eyes, doesn't dare look

RYAN
Home?
MATT
Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where
pitch tent?
RYAN
Lake Zurich.
MATT
Where hell that?
RYAN
Illinois.
MATT
Illinois. Central time zone. That
makes roughly... 8pm right now.
What good people Lake
Zurich 8 o'clock

Ryan tries overcome fear looks out. She frowns,
terrified sight, hides face inside
helmet.
RYAN
I don't know...
MATT
What doing?
She tries again. This time forces stares
Earth, 500 kilometers her.
MATT (CONT'D)
Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've
clocked hospital
putting customary 18-hour
shift. You're driving home...
Ryan's wide open eyes transfixed Earth, like deer
headlights.
RYAN
The radio. I listen radio...
MATT
There go. Let guess. NPR?
Classical. Top for--
RYAN
Anything. Doesn't matter. As long
don't talk. I drive...
Her glassy eyes reveal strong emotion growing inside her,
taking body. It fear, deeper
painful.
Matt studies curiously.
MATT
What miss there?
Ryan looks Earth. It felt far away.
A long silence answer.
MATT (CONT'D)
Is Mr. Stone?
She frowns, unable comprehend initially,
particularly complicated bit math, shakes head.
RYAN
No...
MATT
Nobody special? Someone there,
looking up, thinking you?
Ryan closes eyes. She remains silent. A silence can't
hide unspeakable pain.
RYAN
I daughter.
Her eyes flutter, open. She frozen moment,
stunned.
Her gaze shifts finds-
Matt, studying MIRROR.
MATT
What name?
RYAN
Sarah... She four. Stupidest thing-
school trip swimming pool.
She playing tag- slipped, hit
head, it... She loved
tag. I'm sure laughing.
She looks away, Earth. It looks small. Remote.
RYAN (CONT'D)
When I received I driving
that's I do. I
wake up, I work I

Matt finally averts eyes. He rolls wrist over, consults
timer, watching numbers slowly count down.
RYAN (CONT'D)
02 percent.
MATT
Well, well, d'you know. I
good news bad news.
RYAN
Uhuh?
MATT
The good news we're minutes

Russians stash vodka...
that's good thing cus I'm running

minutes short of......breaking
Anatoly's record.
SUDDENLY, COMING FROM INSIDE RYAN'S HELMET-
BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
RYAN
Mmm...Mmmm.
MATT
What?
RYAN
I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure
low...
MATT
The tank there's
oxygen suit, sip,
Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, beer.
Sip. We'll there.
She nods.
MATT (CONT'D)
Let's go.
Matt gives Ryan gentle push, waiting tether goes
taut, and-
He gives SMALL THRUST position right
direction.
He holds SINGLE THRUST longer previous
ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards-
THE SPACE STATION-
Which half mile away, modules
clearly visible. It clear that-
IT WAS HIT BY THE DEBRIS.
MATT (CONT'D)
Houston blind visual

Earth impossible.
The surface module badly scratched solar panels
ripped.
THE SECOND SOYUZ visible, attached Station's
Docking Module. A piece red white fabric floats
spherical capsule.
Ryan's losing breath.
RYAN
Shouldn't turning? We're
DRIFTING AGAIN--
MATT
Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting good. We
want drift. I wasn't kidding
fumes. This
good thrusts left. If we're lucky....
They approach Space Station, ahead
meters below.
She's sweating starts hyperventilate.
MATT (CONT'D)
Steady...
She looks down, eyes Station passing beneath them.
MATT (CONT'D)
Ready... aim...
It looks Station going slip away altogether.
MATT (CONT'D)
...fire.
Matt triggers THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory
carries straight line, tether tenses,
breaking Matt's direction.
He fires counter momentum.
A VERY LONG THRUST sends right direction,
straight Station, great speed.
The Station getting close, they're going fast.
Matt ignites FRONTAL THRUSTER, begins slow
down, thrust stops.
Ryan, following momentum, begins pass Matt.
RYAN
Break... You break.
MATT
I can't. Can's empty. We're coming
fast we're going hit hard. Grab
hold tight!
Just Ryan CRASHES SOLAR PANEL, unable
grab hold. As tumbles past, body Station looms.
Matt misses solar panels, COLLIDES Station.
As begins drift past, reaches snares railing.
Ryan passes flying him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt.
The momentum great LETS GO railing.
Ryan floats roof Space Station, trying grab
hold handles rods stick modules,
she's floating high.
She's quickly reaching end Station,
handle left ahead, chance floating away
black void.
She extends arm GRABS handle tightly dear life
AND-
SHE STOPS.
She's holding handle.
RYAN
I got it. I got it.
INSIDE THE HELMET-
She looks sees-
Matt floating straight and-
He COLLIDES her. For moment face face,
glass headgear separates faces.
But loses grip handle impact projects
emptiness.
Her drifting intercepted Solar Panel. She crashes
it, shattering it, Matt rolls it.
Ryan bounces Earth, tensing tether, pulling
Matt, making descend panel.
The sharp edges broken panels cut tether two.
RYAN (CONT'D)
The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm
I'm detached.
MATT
Grab hold. Grab anything.
Ryan drifting away Station. She sees infinite
black void ahead and-
HER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE.
It tangled strings fabric, slowing down.
Ryan panting, face covered sweat. She turns
SEES-
Matt rolling, drifting direction.
She stretches arm.
Matt's arm outstretched.
MATT (CONT'D)
(AN EDGE)
Give me... here, Ryan.
He's trying light it, he's struggling
reach her.
Ryan stretches farther.
Matt's hand comes closer hers.
The tips fingers touching.
RYAN
I've got you. I've got you--
The tips fingers touch --
BUT THEY MISS.
As Matt drifts past.
MATT
Shit... shit...
RYAN
No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you.
Don't. Don't. NO
As parachute tenses, STOPS.
The tether attached Matt's suit passes feet away
AND-
Ryan grabs tether. It slides closed fist, until-
Her grip tightens tether STOPS.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Gotcha!
Matt's momentum pulling Ryan, dragging loose
parachute.
MATT
You let go.
RYAN
What? No--
MATT
You to.
RYAN
No!
MATT
Those ropes loose,
I'm pulling me. You
let die--
RYAN
I'm letting go! We're fine.
Her leg slides loose rope floats

RYAN
You're going anywhere, you're
GOING ANYWHERE--
MATT
It's you.
Matt begins unharness tether.
RYAN
Please don't this.
Matt unhooked tether holding hand.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Please don't this. Please don't
this.
MATT
You're going Ryan.
RYAN (O.S.)
No!
He opens hand, letting tether, BEGINS TO FLOAT
AWAY.
Relieved Matt's pull, parachute begins retrieve,
pulling Ryan closer Station.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I you! I you.
Matt drifts away Station space.
Ryan bumps station, pulled parachute,
twists turns finally grabbing hold rail.
MATT
(ON RADIO)
Ryan copy? Do copy?
An ALARM GOES OFF.
RYAN
My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm
went off.
MATT
You need board station. Can

She turns, looking Station's Airlock.
MAT
Do copy?
(P.O.V shot - beginning blur)
RYAN
Yes. Yes. I it. I it.
MATT

Good. That's want go.
You're losing focus, right?
RYAN
Yes.
MATT
That's you're breathing CO2
you're losing consciousness. You
need board Station.
Her eyes flutter...
MATT (CONT'D)

Move!
Ryan blinks, TURNS OFF ALARM, begins climbing
module Station.
RYAN
Ok.
The transmission weaker, filled STATIC.
MATT

RYAN
No... I'm coming you.
MATT
You know, Ryan nice

Ryan starts respond, falters, watching Matt's figure
grow smaller.
THE SAD CROONING HANK WILLIAMS crackles dying

RYAN
(in daze)
Matt...
Only static hisses...
RYAN (CONT'D)
Matt!
Static Matt falls deeper distance,
lost sea white specks and-
The transmission ends.
SILENCE
INSIDE THE HELMET-
Ryan dizzy, sweating, having trouble focusing. She sees
MATT-
Nothing dot.
She stretches hand him, trying touch
tips fingers. But dot vanished
never-ending darkness.
EVERYTHING IS BLURRED.
Ryan lose consciousness, when-
A new ALARM GOES OFF.
She takes deep breath opens eyes widely.
If doesn't move, she'll die.
Ryan pulls forward, reaching handle Soyuz.
She grabs reaches another, climbing way
Station's airlock.
But she's losing focus.
As right hand reaching handle,
blur, misses.
INSIDE THE HELMET -
Her brain shutting lack oxygen. She struggles
open eyes mumbles words unintelligible.
She reaches again, blindly. Her hand grips handle,
huge effort-
She sprints Docking Module, swinging handle
handle, continual push, reaches the-
AIRLOCK.
She stops, takes deep breath and-
She turns latch OPENS re-entry hatch.
The hatch BLOWS OPEN air inside cabin escapes

With effort, pulls airlock.
AIRLOCK MODULE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.
As enters 180-degree flip. As soon legs
in, grabs latch, and-
CLOSES THE HATCH.
She turns latch and-
THE CABIN IS SEALED OFF.
INSIDE THE HELMET-
Ryan suffocating. With little oxygen body
intoxicated nitrogen blood, breathing
coarse painful.
She hardly eyes open, pushes
cabin, cylinder lit circular mercury
lights. She reaches the-
CONTROL PANEL, small screen monitors
atmospheric temperature levels inside airlock.
She presses button panel and-
THE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE.
A low hissing sound heard tanks Station
begin pumping pure oxygen airlock. The control panel's
monitor shows atmospheric levels slowly rising.
INSIDE THE HELMET-
Ryan gasps air, none.
She stares red-orange-green graph control panel
showing atmospheric levels. It reads red. Her pupils begin
dilate as-
SOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE-
In vacuum space carry sound waves,
sound begins travel oxygen slowly
fills cabin.
The sounds muffled, like sounds outside world
heard womb.
A beeping sound intermittently penetrates airlock, anxious
halting.
The Control System's graph slowly moves red orange. The
cabin fully pressurized.
But do.
With sharp motion-
SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET-
And pushes head.
She gasps air coughs.
She contorts shakes, fighting breath
atmosphere airlock. Her helmet bounces walls
cabin, floating.
The beeping sound clearer recognizable -
alarm ringing Station.
Orange turning green. Her lungs begin absorb oxygen
breath even. Her body floats, relaxed
confined space airlock.
SHE FLOATS.
Ryan brings hands removes glove.
And other.
Desperately, begins unscrew lock near waist. She
squirms suit pushes upper half.
Then throws lower half, squirming
shedding old skin, desperate free
claustrophobia suit.
Wearing underwear t-shirt, floats mid-air,
relieved exhausted. The hum Space Station surrounds
her.
Then, slowly, pulls knees chest enfolds
arms, floating fetal position.
For moment, Ryan simply hangs suspension, fly amber,
surrendering poetry planets, rotating slowly

She OPENS drawers, looking something.
RYAN
Come on, come on.
She finds she's looking for: BAG OF WATER straw
end. She unscrews begins drink it.
She DRINKS long gulps, squeezing bottle, trying quench
thirst. DROPS FLOAT mouth water overflows.
They float face like perfect pearls different

She takes pause drinking catch breath. The water
cooling down, takes long, thirsty
gulp empties bag.
She checks count STOPWATCH- 14 minutes counting

And Soyuz drifts upwards, Station passes it.
SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
Now Ryan through-
THE PORTHOLE-
The parachute tangled solar panel ropes
tensing up, and-
SHE'S SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL.
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
The Soyuz stabilizes Station, parachute entwined
solar panel.
SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
She looks at-
THE PORTHOLE-
The rope extends cabin parachute tangled
Station.
RYAN
Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
SILENCE
The Station hovers Soyuz like large whale swimming
beneath tiny lifeboat.
The HATCH Soyuz OPENS.
Ryan comes craft space. She's wearing space
suit packed carries large bag.
She holds handles floats, SAFELY TETHERED
inside cabin.
She LOOKS around-
The International Space Station looming presence floating
meters below. It pulling Soyuz parachute.
An ALARM STOPWATCH RINGS. It's 85 MINUTES.
She turns alarm looks around.
RYAN
Clear skies chance
satellite debris.
SHE HUMS A SONG, tune reminiscent Hank Williams
Melody Matt played earlier.
She begins climb vessel. With plenty oxygen
pressurized suit, difficult task.
She pulls handle handle, making way
Soyuz reaching-
THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER-
An impact blown open cover. Three ropes float
container space. Three meters away vessel
rope branches dozens parachute strings. Next it-
A second cover badly damaged.
Harnessing handle, inspects ropes. The
ropes bolted container's frame.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Okay. We detach home.
Piece cake.
She harnesses bag RESUMES HUMMING, louder time.
She unzips bag takes PISTOL GRIP tool,
noticing her-
DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming thirty meters
away Station.
A tiny piece high-speed debris crashes
Station's Solar panels, shattering causing Station
tremble.
She places tool FIRST BOLT, stretching arm
parachute container. It awkward position.
She pulls trigger drill rotates, turning bolt,
slides notch.
She places tool bolt pulls
trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER time.
She HUMS breath SWEAT begins drop
forehead.
She focused, unaware her-
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes
it.
THE BOLT COMES OFF.
As FLOATS OFF space, Ryan drops PISTOL GRIP uses
hands detach rope frame.
The ROPE FLOATS away Soyuz, undulating like long
snake, but-
Ryan notices Pistol Grip floating away.
She stretches arm trying catch it,
reach.
She pushes pistol grip, barely manages
grab sees-
RYAN (CONT'D)
Oh shit.
THE TIDE OF DEBRIS floating STRAIGHT AT HER.
She pulls container.
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.
It CRASHES SILENCE modules, creating
hole size car wheel. The vacuum sucks BLUE FLAMES

Ryan brings pistol-grip SECOND BOLT pulls
trigger. The bolt spins.
Ryan HUMMING louder louder.
Ryan stares intently head bolt turning
debris zooms her.
THE SECOND BOLT COMES OFF.
She quickly pulls rope loose frame lets
float away.
Shaken impacts, Space Station drags Soyuz
it.
She braces as-
DEBRIS WREAKS HAVOC- pieces hit Station, crash
another. Each collision creates debris
ricochet fly away directions.
The Soyuz pulled remaining parachute rope,
Station spins control.
Ryan starts humming louder, bravado tilt now.
Her face covered sweat, pours eyes,
making difficult unscrews bolt.
Behind her, cluster debris PIERCES THE PARACHUTE.
Ryan continues drilling as-
MORE DEBRIS HIT THE STATION.
It CRASHES Japanese Lab, silently EXPLODES
millions pieces. The pieces expand away
Station.
THE LAST BOLT COMES OFF.
Ryan manages unhook rope, freeing Soyuz
collapsing Space Station.
She braces vessel, sees-
RYAN (CONT'D)
Shit!
The Soyuz heading straight Station's Solar
Panels.
RYAN (CONT'D)
No... no... no..
The Soyuz' Solar Panel collides Station's, shattering
smaller pieces debris hit Ryan.
The Soyuz spins away as-
MORE DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.
Ryan watches succession satellite fragments pepper
slowly revolving Station segments. As segments crumble,
colliding additional debris, fragments glimmer
magnificently join...
...the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting dark
Earth. All sudden...
EVERYTHING IS CALM.
She pauses, blinking suddenly distance. Her gaze
remains fixed vast nothingness--for good reason--but
FIXED something.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I hate space.
SOYUZ SPACECRAFT. CONTROL CABIN.
A SYMPHONY OF ALARMS shrieks loudly. The hatch FLIES open

harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling
abandon.
Each howling reaches deeper cathartic, unlocking
emotions festering time, and-
TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear crystals, spilling
lashes floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES

AND SHE BREATHES.
SHE BREATHES AIR.
And breath steadies-
SHE SMILES.
She pushes face ground, enjoying sense

And STANDS UP.
ONE FOOT FALLS heavily ground. It sinks mud
THEN-
ANOTHER FOOT.
Ryan's FEET solidly planted mud.
RYAN (CONT'D)

coping weight. And then-
The foot follows as-
SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH, laughing.
SHE IS PUNCH DRUNK.
SHE IS FREE.
