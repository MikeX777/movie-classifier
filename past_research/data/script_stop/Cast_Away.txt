feet away. It looks Chuck
intelligence deep alien.
He slowly comes knees stares it.
The blow hole opens WHOOSH, shoots geyser fine
spray settles Chuck mist.
The whale rises farther, dwarfing raft. From whale
comes deep sound like foghorn.
Startled, Chuck jumps back, rocking raft. He catches

The whale blows again, drenching Chuck spray.
Chuck touches whale again.
GOODCHUCK
You like that?
Very slowly drifts raft.
GOODCHUCK

Very slowly whale moves ahead raft, vast body
passing Chuck.
GOODCHUCK
No, don't go. Look, I've got fish.
Chuck rips fillet line throws
whale, ignores it.
GOODCHUCK
Please don't dive. Please.
The whale slowly sinks, suddenly arches huge
heads straight bottom.
For moment, remains flukes, black
vertical dark blue sky. With swoop,
flukes destroy Chuck raft. But don't
slowly sink.
Then gone.
We Chuck's face stares whale
been, surface marked ring concentric ripples
reach gently rock raft.
EXT. OCEAN - DAY
Chuck checks water. It green floaties.
It looks awful. He takes jug, puts mouth,

BADCHUCK
Look you've done.
He dips hand ocean, splashes sea water
face, splutters out, licks lips. He
thirsty.
He looks water jug, vomit, turns

But work makes thirstier. He looks jug
again.
Picks up. Takes long drink.

Chuck picks spear, stabs it, misses.
Suddenly fish end spear. It
struggles, scoops raft, brutally pounds
head, twists stone knife spine. The struggling
stops.
Chuck looks dead fish begins sob.
GOODCHUCK

He cries uncontrollably. As cries cuts head,
pulls eyeballs, eats one. Then sucks
marrow head.
Then takes heart eats that. Then eats liver.
As chewing, cuts meat strips.
When done, takes backbone, breaks it, sucks
it.
Fish scales shine hair, blood covers chest.

For moment Chuck uncomprehending. He watches Wilson
slowly floats away.
CHUCK
Please, sharks.
Then dives water! Swims frantically
Wilson.
Wilson floats away him. He swims, he's weak.
Finally gets Wilson. He reaches out, pushes

It bobs waves. Chuck treads water, exhausted.
Where raft?
CHUCK
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
Then turns way. The raft drifted

CHUCK
Shit! Wilson!
He swims raft, barely moving. No matter hard
swims, raft recede him.
Finally reaches it, hangs side, breathing hard,
choking, crying.
He struggles pull board.
But weak, weak. He can't it.
Summoning primitive reserve strength, tries again.

Nothing waves.
This much. Chuck starts cry.

fastens it.
He sits meager shade, head knees.
Closes eyes. Just minute.
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - LATER
A different sort shadow crosses Chuck's face. He opens
eyes.
There, riding right raft, ship, huge rusty

Chuck sits up, can't believe it. Struggles cover himself.
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - LATER
Chuck lifted rusted steel boat
Jacob's ladder.
EXT. SHIP - DAY - LATER
Chuck steps board, can't support himself.
The crew gathers around. None speak English,
