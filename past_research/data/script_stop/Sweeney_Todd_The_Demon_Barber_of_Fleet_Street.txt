1 INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT 1
Foreboding organ music heard...
We looking rough brick floor ...
alley? ... cobblestone street? ... warehouse? factory?
... we're sure...
The flickering glow flame illumination...
The ominous organ music continues as...
From frame...
A dark pool blood slowly begins spread ... moving
frame, defying gravity ... flickering flame reflected
blood...
Finally, pool blood fills entire frame.
SUDDENLY--
A shrill factory whistle blows--
ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling spine-shattering --
whistle bizarre combination sound: factory
whistle; hog slaughtered; dog snarling; roaring
inferno; human scream--
And man's face appears, upside down, reflected pool
blood.
He THE GENTLEMAN, slender dandy pearl grey gloves
matching waistcoat. A cold superior aristocrat.
The camera slowly revolves -- Gentleman right
as--
GENTLEMAN
Attend tale Sweeney Todd.
His skin pale eye odd.
