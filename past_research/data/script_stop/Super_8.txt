FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
December 16, 2010
OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED
MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
covered black, white red. It reads large 40's era,
hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
"DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" that, NUMBERS, painted
hanging metal cards. Four possible digits hang here,
currently three: "784."
SLOWLY PUSH IN sign MAN APPEARS, rising
forklift, greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
"4" hooks. Then removes "8." Then "7."
Finally, hangs number. "1."
The man LOWERS frame creep closer
hanging single digit, wondering accident...

They begin walk dirt tunnel, TALL OVAL
TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT
We're SO FAR AWAY, screen black,
small speck SPARKLY LIGHT.
They come area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming INTERSECTION --
NEW TUNNEL branches off.
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
There's DIM LIGHT ahead, tunnel BENDS. The
RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe Cary slowly
forward -- seeing off-camera scares
amazes once.
IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE
CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM
THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS
OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO
SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,
GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
They cross side. Cary bumps HANGING
SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary scream, Joe puts hand

DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.
AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE

Joe moves away Cary better view

hair, wakes up.
TINA (CONT'D)

INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
Joe Alice helped FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF
PRUITT. They're breath, survival instinct
kicked in:

JOE
Sheriff, came way.
SHERIFF PRUITT
Don't argue me.
TINA
Come on, kids, let's

Joe Alice follow. They run tunnel. We PUSH IN ON
THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS
IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns sees
humans gone. He takes off.
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
Sparkler lighting way, we're Joe Alice -- Pruitt
Tina them:
JOE

JOE
I told out!
CARY
I thought way out. I
tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
PRUITT
Kids, come on, gotta go.
117.
BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE
CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL
DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE
DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS
terrifying foursome sprint opposite direction!
After RUNNING HARD beat:
They haul ass, long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY
INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE --
They run run run, BOOM: hit DEAD END.
A DIRT WALL. No tunnels. No options. Out breath,
turn -- dare horrifying blackness.
The SOUND sparkler, erratic breathing
DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --
APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST
THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS
THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
JOE
GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
CARY
Joe, doing?
IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS
IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
JOE
WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
HORRIBLE!
CARY
Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
JOE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice Cary SCREAM AS
JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME --
moment fear comes else. Simple truth --
WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
JOE (CONT'D)
-- I know bad things happen-- bad
things happen,
live. You live,
live, you're gonna okay--
118.
JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT
MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'
COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.
AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In way,
imagine mother had. And Joe feels too. AND
AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe
backs creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS
STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
CARY
Okay, wait minute, WHAT?!
Then, HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
- like THUNDER -- LOOK UP --
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The kids round corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- INVISIBLY
DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- WATER TOWER -- different
speeds different personalities, metal objects BULLET
TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS STOVE RIPS THROUGH
IT -- PAN WITH IT TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS past -- bicycles
silverware sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST
THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
TWILIGHT ZONE -- things eventually SLAMMING
WATER TOWER, objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING
ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- KIDS TURN:
RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE cubes
BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice cry-
laughing seeing work --
CARY
-- what's doing...?
JOE
... he's making model.
AGAIN AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning FORM WHAT
IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE
FROM INSIDE continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE
SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
119.
BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS
OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE
STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT
FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES
OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
TOWER.
JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
JACK
-- I got you. I got you.
LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-
FORMED -- here, hugged father, Joe
LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- considers
it, confused moment -- reaches pulls
out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- holds chain,
LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting go.
Joe knows means. He looks father,
understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
NECKLACE UP, tower -- thing PULLING... TEARS
Joe's eyes looks -- wanting let go,
knowing must. Jack, heartsick, watches son,
verge letting go. Alice watches Joe, verge tears
-- Joe can't bring it, now,
ever. But happens.
Pulled invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And
what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH Joe's MOTHER. A young
woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks
mother -- moment, Jack's eyes
suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming
face finally Jack reaches -- puts hand
son's shoulder -- Joe needed, really.
And finally... all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
IN SLOW MOTION, necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
TO THE WATER TOWER!
AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION --
that's Joe sees CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE
WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS
IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT
COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
120.
THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,
OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
And PUSH IN Charles Marin, watch, amazed,
distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
And PUSH IN DONNY SLEEPS, REFLECTION OF THE RISING
SHIP seen windshield --
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
Joe Alice, Jack, Louis Cary watch, amazed,
ship disappears night sky, TIGHT ON JOE'S
HAND, takes ALICE'S.
And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
As SCORE SWELLS, finally...
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
