And slowly camera begins pulling back, leaving
flowers, brown, rolling current leaving

croaky voice singing, "God save gracious King"... Dyer:
"Sergeant Major --," Sergeant Major: "Take aim!," Dyer:
"Fire!," sound massed rifle fire, screams... "You
best friend... highest guru, sovereign lord."
"Who hell he?," "I don't know, sir." "My
Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi."... sound rioting, women's
screams, terror... "Find child -- child mother
father killed. A little boy... high."...
"He thinks he's failed."... "Long live Mahatma Gandhi!...
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!"
