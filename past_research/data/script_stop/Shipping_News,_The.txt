INT. LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT
Glaring fluorescence, trash overflowing cheap detergent boxes,
Coke machine flashing lights orange. Only dryers
humming. It's late. Keep PANNING to...
...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled
newspapers dryer. She flattens folds meticulously,
glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission.
...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE spread late supper
neat cloth atop dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette,
olives. Bottle red. An air competence, indomitable
upbeatness. He ignores spy-dressed-as-bag-lady
normal. More curious about...
...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads

slowly. Set QUOYLE's dryer Snickers bar
snickers wrappers. His version cold supper. He reaches
candy, seeing it's one, he...
...rises. Goes candy machine. Drops 65 cents, hits
button. The Snickers starts fall, gets caught
mechanism moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One
retelling story life. He BANGS machine half-
heartedly. Nope. Shakes shambling strength. Nada.
POUNDS coin return button. Hat trick. He empties pocket.
Studies results. Not enough. And sigh...
...he ambles dryer. Starts unwrap
Snickers. Partridge taking in. But Mata Hari
Neat Newspapers goes candy machine, KICKS violently. Out
fall Snickers 65 cents. She scoops both, turns
single motion to...
...GLARE death enemy. Quoyle opens mouth comment.

...his dryer STOPS. He pops open. Stares in. Blinks.
Suddenly YANKS tangle graying shirts grimy floor
reveal been...
...STAINED streaky BLUE cheap pen, quietly melting amid
pile. This slips beneath Quoyle's expectation level. The
big, soft face pitifully, yes, adorably, devastated.
QUOYLE (a murmur)

And bystander. This comment shirts.
PARTRIDGE (softly)
Nah. Rub ink hot salt

QUOYLE (V.O., staring)
Then again. If you're kinda

PARTRIDGE
And cuppa bleach in,
time through.
As Quoyle gazes benefactor, woman sneaks up, SNATCHES
Help Wanted ads. Races dryer. As boys

staring antique TV. Quoyle goes THROUGH all, cop
doggedly wake, sinks knees beside...
BUNNY
I can't this.
Bunny ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding vintage
Gameboy. She wears clean clothes, freshly-washed hair,
comfortable smile.
QUOYLE (very soft)

And kisses her, lightly, lips.
QUOYLE (softer still)
Hi.
She kisses back, harder, mouth. The lopsided grin

emotions.
QUOYLE
But driven terrible
forces, understand.
She locked door. Even me.
Agnis good chair. Teacup ample lap. Assessing
photo end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive
pose. The snapshot enshrined neighboring votive rose
jelly jar glass.
AGNIS
So wasn't bitch

Quoyle's eyes cut instinctively daughter, innocence
protected distance absorption Warren's passivity.
AGNIS
Don't stress. She mighta heard worse

AGNIS (bottomless pride)

BUNNY
The green makes hurl.

The cloud lifts further, house stands

Quoyle looks her. Looks house. Looks her.
QUOYLE

PETAL
Maybe it's filled fat.

The way said that. They turn. A shrug...
NUTBEEM

Wouldn't want that. Very silent table. Against din
place. Is serious?
NUTBEEM (softly)

after, doubt.
And smiles. Serious heart attack. A long beat.
QUOYLE (a murmur)
Be careful.

So feeling eyes. Nutbeem say...
NUTBEEM
Well. With warning.
And return feeling. With own.
EXT./INT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT
Quoyle GROANING weight cases beer cheap rum
pulled wagon. Plenty go. Staggers
into...
...Nutbeem's tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface
stacks plastic-wrapped party platters cold cuts, cheese
red-eyed olives. Nutbeem jamming beers tubs ice.
Quoyle peers teensy closet bathroom...
QUOYLE
What's barrel for?
SEE now. Half sawed-off BARREL, MOLASSES stenciled
orange, fills shower stall.
NUTBEEM

INT. TRAILER - NIGHT
VIEW window line HEADLIGHTS arriving. We
immersed ungodly WHITE NOISE all-gentleman's Newfie
soiree, music pushed level distortion, assorted
grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As
struggle look around...
...every square inch crammed tight semi-conscious drunks.
Tert Card boys circle potato chip barrel,
handy urinal. Near door, Dennis holding forth, arm
tight Quoyle listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle
fights way...
...OUT trailer, cold night air party MUCH
wilder, given elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER supine form o
Billy Pretty, singing himself. Finds Jack Buggit
beer hand rum other. Wraps drunken arm
Jack's neck. Starts talk ear. Jack looks suspicious. A
FIGHT breaks feet away. They don't notice. Closing in,
hear...
QUOYLE (shouting din)
SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN
ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS
LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON
AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE
JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH.
Jack nods. Grins. That's pretty funny.
QUOYLE
THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX.
'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU
REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!' AND HE JUMPS.
This. Is funnier.
QUOYLE
NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON
THE GIRDER. HE OPENS HIS BOX.
'HOLY MOLEY! BOLOGNA SANDWICH
AGAIN! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS!'
AND LEAPS OFF.
Funniest yet. Jack chuckling already.
QUOYLE
AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE
SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED
SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY
DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT
PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T
GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!'
Quoyle chortling. But Jack stares dead eyes.
JACK
YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE.
QUOYLE
OH, YAR. FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.
At point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit wet pants...
JACK
MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!
POUNDING poor Quoyle, dissolved hysterics.

And suddenly. Quoyle left alone.
Among conscious, is.
INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Knitted wool, color oxblood, lies timeworn leather

There feeling empowerment release Herry. His grin
splits round face. His eyes heart dancing.
PULL SLOWLY BACK...through window, past porch,
yard. To figure. By fence. He stands motionless.
Except foot tapping, slightly, time
music.
We can't tell Quoyle sees. But eyes
heart drowning.
EXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNING
As Quoyle shuffles up, Nutbeem's trailer turned

You're looking dishy, Q.
QUOYLE
Feeling more. What's

NUTBEEM (laughs)
And boat! Omigod!
BILLY

Her eyes deeper now. And beat, anger slips away.
WAVEY
All funny, odd little folks?
They hearts me.
So I wouldn't alone. Having

WAVEY
Okay. Now I'm drunk enough. To

Her eyes ask. Are you?
WAVEY
You're thinking we're kindred

Shakes head. Uh-uh.
WAVEY
You don't love Petal. You

Means words opening blow. Jacks better. Here comes
hole card...
WAVEY
You think it's love.
Because it's not, you're dead
inside. So flame
flickering. Cos it's you'll

Pure contempt. And honesty.
WAVEY
You see. You're good liar, too.
Lifts cap. Screws bottle.
WAVEY
Where's damn eggshells? That's
I came see.
And prison shock shame. He points shelf. She
OFF desk, like panther...
...SNATCHES tiny padded box treasure. RAISES high
smash it, and...
...stops. To panic. In eyes.
It brings tears. Pooling hers.
And sets treasure down, tenderness decency
requires.
WAVEY
Can guess I know
Petal?
He cannot.
WAVEY
Because I. Are kindred
souls. After all.
And that. Is came say.
WAVEY
So I told husband. To fuck

She crosses floor. Scoops coat. Walks, little
wobbly, door. Sighs.
WAVEY
Thanks mirror.
Nods. Means that.
WAVEY
If I don't you. Happy New Year.
And leaves. The door closes quietly. Quoyle looks it. To

And back.
