heart
attacks getting shit up. After
months, big day arrives,
box "Pup Corn" pops
belt. He comes running home
box, pulls school. We
pile living room,

"Shelmer," 8 year old mutt. "Here
Shelmer," dad cries. He's got
little fucking pup corn
hand, "Here girl." This dog eat
anything, eats rocks, anything.
She walk's dad's hand, looks
little pellet, licks
once, turns around, walks
room. Shelmer rejected "Pup Corn."
Fifteen months dad's life,
right there. Not dog ate Pup
Corn. Not one. Three months later,
"Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven.
My father got it. Never.
SILENCE hangs again.
