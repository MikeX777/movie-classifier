NELS

butt. A right-handed fella,
precise.
HOOKS

Slight shrug.
WHALEY
Well, I doctor Jap

kendo wounds, times. Looked
exactly like one.
HOOKS

WHALEY

sticks.
And prosecutor's eyes drift defendant. So
jury's same. HOLD Kabuo's regal bearing. His
neutral mask.
HOOKS (O.S.)
No questions.

respiration. I believe I said that.
NELS (slightly confused)
But drowned person can't breathe.
WHALEY
Of course not. The foam means
went breathing.
Ah.
WHALEY

death.
NELS

WHALEY

NELS

NELS
Of course, is. Now
head injury. You
object narrow flat. That
inference, correct?
WHALEY (really pissed)
It's job infer, that's
coroners do. You hit
crowbar, ball-peen hammer,
fall motorcycle, injuries
look different, that's area
expertise.
Nels nods. He quiet now. The witness distracted
volunteering opinions Nels wish for.
NELS
In motorcycle example. Those
injuries produced head
propelled object.
Rather reverse, yes?
WHALEY
Obviously.
NELS
Can tell object moved

Nels nods. Whaley frustrated.
WHALEY

WHALEY
Absolutely not. Probably
hours. Four most.
A pause.
NELS

WHALEY
Yes, I'm sure.
Nels nods. Silence.
NELS

The barracks, everything, distance them.
HATSUE
You think we're far

No sarcasm voice. She lets words carry irony.
Her mother stops. Looks directly, strong. Even
tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.
HATSUE
Mom, is, don't

GILLANDERS
Now, Miyamoto gonna know
advance? That Carl loses
batteries. Must happen ever'
20 years so.
Another chuckle gallery.
NELS
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank
coming down, cold
weather.
GILLANDERS
Well, mighty warm
here. Specially Mr. Hooks.
And looks prosecutor. Who rises, easily. A polite
fuck-you smile. Hooks strolls now. Slow steady. Straight
witness box. Rests hands rail. Leans in.
HOOKS
What defendant follows Carl.
And pretends batteries
dead? Would Carl tie help?
And smile Gillander's face. Stops. Cold.
HOOKS
Is word you're groping
for...'yes', perha...
JUDGE (O.S.)
Alvin!
HOOKS
Rephrase. Do agree

GILLANDERS
So why's D-6 Carl's well?
HOOKS
Who's say? Maybe
spare, all. Or maybe
defendant left it, potential
alibi. In case somebody saw
Ship Channel Bank.
(beat)
In case
together, knowing hostility.
Between families.
Gillanders. Actually thinking that.
HOOKS
My question is. Could Carl
tied help defendant?
A beat. A cleared throat.
GILLANDERS
It coulda happened. And I start
it's doubtful, you'd probl'y
'no questions', right?
Once more, laughter. Enough bring gavel DOWN.
HOOKS
Right that. And right
'coulda happened'.
Turns back, walks away.
HOOKS
Thanks help. Hope
witness box wasn't warm
comfort.
All eyes follow prosecutor, sits. Except
defendant. His stare forward. Recalling...
INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT
Kabuo seated concrete floor cell, leaning
wall. Leaving cot. For guest.
NELS
But toughest scenario. Is
Hooks raise.
Kabuo watching. Quiet. Takes breath...
KABUO
And what's that?
NELS
That came Carl accident.
Like said. Gave battery.
Like said. Asked
seven acres. Like said.
The hardest. Straightest. Look.
NELS
Only. He said no.
Silence.
NELS
And something...happened. That
you'd planned. Because
you're cold-blooded killer.
Nobody flinches. Nobody blinks.
KABUO
I'm hot-blooded killer, huh?
Like soldier. Like samurai.
NELS
You won't hear Hooks.
Because charge first-degree
murder, requires premeditation.
He can't change charge.
Do understand?
NELS
So jury thinks kill.
heat anger. They
acquit.
Do you?
NELS
And couldn't. Be. Re-tried.
Kabuo's face stone. A warrior's mask.
KABUO
You want that.
NELS
I want you. To tell truth.
There kindly smile tonight. No candy bars.
KABUO
You think truth.
NELS
I told wife. Trials aren't
actual truth.
As folks believe true.
That's sad. And it's real.
KABUO
And believe?
Nels sighs. Cocks head side.
NELS
A question first. Why want
know?
KABUO (straight back)
Because you're friend.
The old man thinks that. Studies client.
NELS
I believe good man. Who
belongs family.
And feeling comes. To watery eyes.
NELS
And I believe. You didn't it.
EXT. SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT
Fog. The sound water. Lapping hull boat. The mist
drfits, revealing...
Eyes. They blue. The heavy brows dark gold, matted
damp.
CARL (O.S.)
My batteries drawed down,

PULL BACK him. With keroses lantern air horn.
KABUO (O.S.)
No sweat. We'll pull mine,

empty. And...
...CRASH! The butt end fishing gaff BANGS metal
flange. Again. Again. AGAIN. And blow STRUCK,
huge hand...
...slips, soft metal SLICES Carl's flesh palm.
He stops. Then SMASHES away, twice more. We PULL BACK see...
...two batteries lie well. Carl sucks blood
cut. Then lifts Kabuo's D-6 place...
CARL
Don't know long it's
charge...
KABUO
Keep tonight. We'll catch fish.
I'll ya docks...
Kabuo takes gaff. Heedless Carl's blood butt end.
Carl looks up, crouching well.
CARL (quietly)
Hold on. You know
I do, got somethin' talk
about.
No response Kabuo. He stands larger man. Silent,
neutral. Waiting.
CARL
Seven acres. I'm wonderin'
you'd pay 'em. Just curious,
all.
KABUO
What sellin' 'em for?
Why don't start there.
Which makes big man smile. Just little.
CARL
Did I I selling? But
I was, I'd figure
want 'em real bad. Oughta charge
sall fortune, maybe...
A slight shrug. Of giant shoulders.
CARL
Then again. Maybe you'd want
battery back.
Kabuo doesn't grin back. His face shows all.
KABUO
The battery's in, that's
with. Besides, you'd
m...
CARL
...might same. I
warn 'bout that, chief. I'm
screwed like I
be.
Kabuo's face remains impassive. Patient. And big man squints
it. Holding handkerchief injured hand.
CARL
Hell, I'm sorry, okay? About
damn mess. If I'd
around, mother wouldn't
pulled way.
He sorry. And that, Kabuo's face eases. Becomes like
Carl's own.
CARL (grins)

KABUO (no grin)
I'm American. Did I

CARL (softly)
Not I recall.
KABUO
I killed men looked like
you, pig-fed German bastards. And
blood don't wash easy.
Still smile. Carl staring up.
KABUO
So don't talk Japs,
big Nazi son bitch.
Carl laughs. And Kabuo chuckles, right him. Having
kept poker face longer.
CARL
I bastard. I'm big Hun
Nazi son bitch. And I
got bamboo fishing rod.
KABUO
Oh, yeh?
CARL
Hid mom. Caught mess

CARL

Ole, won't dime less. You
got choice that.
KABUO
Didn't I buyin' I?
What want down? Just bein'
curious, all.
The handkerchief comes away Carl's palm. And rising, hand
extends smaller man.
CARL
A thousand down. We'll sign

Wash years away.
KABUO
Eight hundred. And it's deal.

KABUO

HOOKS
You mean, morning. The

Hooks leans box. Ever slightly invading Kabuo's space.
HOOKS
Well, sheriff batteries

KABUO

Ah. I see.
HOOKS
Conveniently, shed. Only

Kabuo blinks. The man's tone formal. As offer

ISHMAEL

Kabuo's smile faded. The mask returned.
KABUO
That's right.
ISHMAEL
Two. Lanterns.
And Kabuo grins. In spite himself.
KABUO

Two BOATS tied wide-elbowed piers. We've seen before.
MORAN
You threatened me, Chambers, pure

Supporting legs, struggles upward.

You didn't tonight, you?
No answer. Ishmael keeps sipping. Holding eye contact.

Nels thinks that. So jury will, too.
NELS
Now believe

He couldn't know help

NELS
Still lashed mast.
ISHMAEL
He figures perfectly good
lantern banged

NELS
Just freighter comes through?
Isn't coincidence?
ISHMAEL
Coincidences happen. You run
yellow light car comes

happens day. Or maybe...
NELS
Maybe...?
ISHMAEL
Maybe Carl picks
freighter radio,
working. Same report Milholland
heard. And makes
lantern fast. Before freighter's
wake bang around.
NELS
But wrong. He
climbed earlier.
ISHMAEL
