THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.
TV ANCHOR
What see,

Merrill sits chair.
THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN. THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
GLASS WINDOW.
THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY. THEY LOOK AT
THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.
THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD. THERE IS A
RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED
BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT. COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE
BACKYARD. THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.
THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL
AROUND THE YARD. THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE
DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.
The chair closet CREAKS Merrill leans forward
little television screen.
WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE. THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME. WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
TO THE KITCHEN. A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE
KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.
HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.
THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING
INTO THE KITCHEN. THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS. THE
IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.
THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.
MERRILL
Move children! Vamonos!
THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH
THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.
WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. WE SEE A NARROW
ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A
SMALL GARAGE BUILDING. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS
DENSE FOLIAGE. THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
BUILDING.
WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN
PORTUGUESE. THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE
LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN. HE TALKS EXCITEDLY
DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.
BOY WITH HAT
Esta atras da garagem! Esta atras
ai! Is behind!
THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING. THE IMAGE SETTLES
BACK ON THE WINDOW. WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY. THE IMAGE
ZOOMS A BIT. SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING. THE
IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.
AND THEN WE SEE IT.
THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-
HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE
WALL. IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.
Merrill frozen like statue. His mouth open little.
The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE
VIDEO.
THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES. BEAT. WE SEE IT
REWIND. WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A
FLICKER. THE VIDEO STOPS. PLAYS AGAIN.
THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT. SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE
BUILDING. STARTS TO WIDEN OUT. THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL
WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.
THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE
NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE. IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.
IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.
Merrill Hess stares stunned IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL
LIKE CREATURE. THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE
BRANCHES. EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES. THEY MATCH THE BUSHES
WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS. THROUGH THE BOXES,
BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD. BO'S
HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS. SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.
BO
I'm okay.
ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON. IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT. HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
SHELVES NEAR HIM. BEAT.
HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.
He turns knob "on." The radio lights up, sound
emerges it's speakers. Merrill turns channel knob
checks stations. No sound. No signal. He
listens LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.
Beat.
MERRILL
What's happening there?
Beat.
GRAHAM
(in dark)
I can't imagine.
THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.
MORGAN
I hope they're better
are. We don't helmets.
THERE IS A LOUD BANG.
BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.
ANOTHER BANG. THE DOOR VIBRATES. THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.
BANG.
GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS. He looks door
turns faces lights.
GRAHAM
They're making noises.
They're trying in.
(beat)
Why that?
Graham looks Merrill's corner darkness. Morgan
moves BEAM ONTO MERRILL.
MERRILL
They want attention
door?
BANG. A beat silence.
GRAHAM
They're distracting us?
MERRILL
From what?
MORGAN
The book says they're probably
good problem solvers.
MERRILL
What book!
MORGAN
They'll way in.
BANG.
GRAHAM
Morgan, flashlight.
Morgan puts FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
THE FLOOR. THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.
THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM. He picks
up.
GRAHAM
Is air vent here?
Merrill moves Graham. ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.
They aim FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM. The
brothers opposite directions.
GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING AS HE MOVES.
MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME. HIS FLASHLIGHT
PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.
A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.
Merrill Graham opposite ends room now.
GRAHAM
I feel air.
MERRILL
Me too.
THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.
GRAHAM
It's getting stronger.
MERRILL
I'm close.
BANG.
THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL. GRAHAM AND
MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.
HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL. HE STARES UP AT THE
TWO LIGHTS.
MORGAN
What?
IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
A BREEZE.
GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.
EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT. A NARROW SET
OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.
MORGAN SCREAMS. THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND. THERE'S
A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE. FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.
WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
MERRILL (O.S.)
Hold vent!
SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT. WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
FACES. MORGAN SCREAMING.
GRAHAM
Pull him!
THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN. WE SEE IT IS
BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.
BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT. MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
THERE. HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL. HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG. HE QUICKLY
MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.
BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM. SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT. HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
OF THE PILE. HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN. RETURNS WITH
ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR. GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
THE REST.
MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED. THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT. A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL. HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.
Merrill slowly catches breath. He reaches
grabs remaining flashlight. HE TRAINS THE BEAM
AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.
HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP. MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST. USING HIM AS A CHAIR. MORGAN'S
FACE IS PALE. HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES. IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW. HE'S SUFFOCATING.
GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.
GRAHAM
We don't medicine.
Merrill looks nephew turning gray.
Graham pulls Morgan closer body talks
child's ear.
GRAHAM
Don't scared Morgan. We'll slow
together. Feel chest.
Feel going out. Breathe

Morgan's throat closing -- face filled strain
panic.
BO

Bo moves Merrill curls watch.
Graham closes eyes. Beat. He opens eyes talks
Morgan's ear.
GRAHAM
Stay me. Stay me. I
know hurts. Be strong baby...
It'll pass.
Graham closes eyes -- talks darkness.
GRAHAM
Don't again. Not

Merrill stares brother's desperate face.
Graham's eyes open Morgan's tiny fingers press
Graham's hand. The fingers squeeze strength
have.
Graham looks Merrill helplessly. Merrill's eyes
water.
Graham's eyes close.
GRAHAM

Graham's eyes open leans close Morgan's ear.
GRAHAM
The fear feeding it... Don't
afraid what's happening...
Believe it's going pass...
Believe it... Just wait... Don't
afraid... The air coming...
Believe... We don't
afraid... It's pass...
Here comes... Don't afraid...
Here comes air...
A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT. LIKE THE
SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.
GRAHAM
There go... We don't
scared all... We know it'll
pass. We believe it... Don't
afraid Morgan.
Morgan's fingers relax little Graham's hand.
THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
THROUGH A STRAW.
Merrill watches Graham's face stays pressed
son.
GRAHAM
Feel chest... Breathe me.
Together... The air going
lungs... Together... We're
same. We're same.
Merrill watches Morgan's chest starts sync
Graham's.
THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
LABORED BREATHS.
Graham's eyes close. He starts crying. He speaks one.
GRAHAM
(soft)
I hate you.
Morgan's fingers relax Graham's hand. Merrill watches
father son breathe together. Merrill Bo hold
tight.
THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
FACES. THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
BASEMENT. TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS. THEY'RE BOTH LOST
IN THEIR THOUGHTS.
Beat.
MERRILL
I save flashlights.
Beat. Graham nods looking over.
MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT. THE BEAM OF
LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT. THEY
DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.
Merrill looks Bo, second flashlight
