FRANK
No, city doesn't discriminate.

Frank, heart pounding, steps closer her.
FRANK (CONT'D)
We're dying, Mary Burke.
He leans kiss her.
MARY

FRANK
Let's fight, then.
WALLS

bust something, bomb something.
WALLS
What want break?
FRANK
(taking drink)
I don't know--let's break
windows.
WALLS
Why?
FRANK
Destruction, distraction. I feel
need.
WALLS
You need reason, Frank. You don't
breaking people's
windows. That's anarchy.
FRANK
What's reason? Give reason,
Tom.
WALLS
Let think.
Tom hits siren swings wildly stopped cab
turban-headed driver:
WALLS (CONT'D)
Classic cabbie move.
(to driver)
Hey, swammy, that's called
crosswalk. You stop it,

Walls turns cross street, spots Noel standing
Mustang, baseball bat shoulder. He wears yesterday's
blood-stained clothes, cut tires tied shoulders
elbows, chest belly wrapped steel wire.
WALLS (CONT'D)
I know work over. Him.
Walls slows Noel lifts bat, swings
Mustang's window, shattering it, puts bat down,
like cane walks parked car.
WALLS (CONT'D)
This guy's terrorizing
neighborhood weeks,
got outta jail, wreaking general
havoc, contributing bad
place. The term "menace
society" him.
FRANK
He's crazy. He can't help it.
WALLS
(stops ambulance)
Well, don't away?
Prisons don't want him. I took
hospital yesterday
again.
Noel reaches car, Bronco, carefully hefts
bat, smashes windshield.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Look that. Tell that's crazy
person. Every calculated. He
knows exactly he's doing. This
guy. I've

NOEL
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.

Noel hauls back, lays Volvo: glass shatters. Noel
holds bat out, extends handle Frank:
NOEL (CONT'D)
Here, try.
FRANK
No, I'd better not.
NOEL
Sure, sure, go.
FRANK
Yeah?
Frank, intrigued Noel's suggestion, forgotten Walls'
plan. He takes bat Tom sneaks Noel, crouching.

nothing, Bucky Dent steps
plate.
NOEL
Oh man, Bucky.
FRANK
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows
what's coming. He steps in, smash,
green monster.
Frank cocks baseball bat, relishing moment, swings
Volvo's window. Shattered glass flies
hands clothes.
Walls, fed this, stands:
WALLS
Frank, hell doing?
Noel, seeing Walls, grabs bat, flees alley.
WALLS (CONT'D)
You stairs there. Meet

Walls takes Noel. Frank, taking flashlight,
enters second alley, walks dark stairs hopefully
circle Noel.
CUT TO:
INT. ALLEY--NIGHT
Mini-flashlight leading way, Frank steps gingerly
refuse-strewn alley. Ahead: footsteps.
He kicks something, thinking it's trash, looks down; body
rustles, pair sleeping eyes look up.
Suddenly silent. He passes row glowing
red doors. Shadows flash distance. He hears woman
crying, shoots flashlight direction: nothing.
Frank hears voice again: Rose's voice:
ROSE'S VOICE
Why kill me, Frank?
FRANK
I didn't mean to.
ROSE'S VOICE
You helped me.
FRANK
I tried help. I wanted to.
Shadows like hands extend wall ahead.
ROSE'S VOICE
Don't love me?
Frank moves reaching arms. The shadows swing like
baseball bats. Noel SCREAMS.
Suddenly, him, blurry mass bloody dreadlocks--
Noel goes flying ground, Walls standing
swinging bat, hitting him, killing him.
WALLS
I got him, Frank!
Frank stands back, watching Walls Noel like static
black white TV screen childhood. Noel, trying
protect himself, cries out.
WALLS (CONT'D)
(swinging bat)
To moon, Alice! You little
motherfucker!
Frank charges forward Walls, sending Tom, baseball
bat flying. Walls ground. Frank bends Noel: Noel's
face covered blood, gasping air, blowing red bubbles,
convulsing.
FRANK
(to Walls)
Get kit! We're gonna tube him!
WALLS
