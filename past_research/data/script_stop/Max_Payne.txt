pristine, frame. Clean peaceful.
MAX'S VOICE
Heaven place
happens.
There's gentle motion blank frame, like swirling 16mm
grain. A RUMBLE starts build, low growing louder...
The grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, dirty
dishwater grey. The RUMBLE HOWLING WIND.
Churning black water LAPS frame...
EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWN

Max's face sinks surface...
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Nothing orient location, time. Just flash
golden light filling hall, warm river cold.
Around closed door, sunlight streams gaps...
BEDROOM
A WOMAN sleeps bed, curled bundled BABY.
Is final, peaceful memory drowning man?
Something's wrong, then: woman's body unnatural
position, thrown laid bed. The crib
tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.
Something BLACK flutters window pane, CRACKING
glass. The sound BLIZZARD creeps in...
RESUME - HUDSON RIVER
Wind POUNDS river Max been, there's
thrashing water. Mixed falling
snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl dive closer water.
MAX'S VOICE
I feel dead there,

Max breaks surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING
undertow. Not simply trying breathe...trying swim.
MAX'S VOICE
It easy mistake make.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHT
Abruptly, snow gone. Just bitter wind left
place, whipping desolate streets long midnight.
Shuffling littered sidewalk, rough-looking MEN
duck wind descending subway...
On dark street, pair BOOTS follows them.

The watch glints passes dark doorway marked
`MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.
SUBWAY BATHROOM
The Men slink bathroom, smirking oblivious
prey sink. Steam rising, sets watch
edge sink washing hands...
MAN #1
Hey, that's nice watch.
No answer. One Men LOCKS door. At sound
lock SNAPPING, raises head...
Max Payne, man struggling life

In murky mirror, Max sees Men circling closer...

PAWNSHOP

PAWNSHOP

Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes watch

In stall, Doug crawls stomach sticky

The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,
restraining WHIMPERING Doug toilet pipe.
MAX

Sighing, Max unlocks Doug pipe, hauling
slamming wall cuffs hands back.

Max stalks bathroom, pushing Doug ahead him.
Down tracks, Kid shrinks shadows...
SUBWAY TUNNEL
The Kid runs dark tracks, nervously glancing
receding light platform. He slows gradually,
relaxing escape certain.
Down walk, startles movement tunnel ahead:

The Kid freezes, frightened BREATHS

He turns retreat tracks, WINGS suddenly
