Long Beach bridge.
She re-checks mirror, filled bobbing headlight beams. One
beam LOCKS ON, straight center glass, blinding
split second. She blinks. Gasps beam

LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR
train phosphorescent glow on:
MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP
point light reflecting pupils. PENTCHO'S VOICE
speaks nowhere, sonorous packed reverb:
PENTCHO'S VOICE
What want?
Mia blinks again. The beam gone. She looks WILL,
oblivious, checking watch.
BACK ON MIA
understanding flooding eyes
SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)
And making FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES,
left, right, above, seat car
RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...
POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY
sucked existence remains
THE VOID. NOTHINGNESS. NADA. CRASH!
60 INT. THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT 60
triggering chain reaction vehicles fish-tailing
bridge. In quick succession come STREAM OF IMAGES:
The pearls colliding...
Mia Will exchanging LOOK...
Traffic HALTING bridge...
Will getting SCORCHED MAN plowed into...
Mia, exiting side, looking BACK BEHIND HER...
PENTCHO, ditching Beetle, car lengths south...
HE RUNS FORWARD, straight path tunnel-like headlight
beam.
MIA PICKS UP SPEED, churning direction.
PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE
point. Suddenly, tiny sparks
light GLOW JUMP portions bridge cable.
SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA
gliding closer. A VOICE sounds:
VOICE
Impact!
Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips...
PULL BACK - HIGHER
It's like plug socket physical landscape
LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
Every cell line, radio wave, satellite feed, fiber-optic cable,
stretching possible direction
FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY
pulsing outward spidery network
GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS.
THE END
