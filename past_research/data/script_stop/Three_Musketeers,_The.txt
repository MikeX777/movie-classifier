THE THREE MUSKETEERS
OPEN ON:
1 EXT. GASCONY - DAWN 1
Dawn. A verdant field Gascony. BIRDS CALL tree-
tops. The WIND RUSTLES green leaves. A fox
darts hedge. And last, anti-pastoral,
place -- sound CLASHING STEEL.
SUPERIMPOSE: France, 1625.
Suddenly, young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
cutting brilliant arcs morning air. The
GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, man
facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger appearance
attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And
moment, bounding low stone wall boisterous
cry.
They battle expanse turf dew.
Girard polished combatant. But d'Artagnan

air wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles somer-
saults. This fun.
Girard d'Artagnan cross field, pass wooden
fence, struggle stable hayloft. As
fight, men utilize variety props. Handfuls
hay, wooden spar, quick kicks heavy boots.
Anything goes swords cut air.
D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard

cornered, executes gymnastic flip roof,
fights high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...

parries blow heavy gloved hand, rolls
offending goose -- glances deadpan apology --
rises fight again.
The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
volves desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
endless reserves wearing down. Then,
possible moment, Girard spies escape: slow-
moving HAYCART RUIMBLING country road. He runs
cart, leaps it, turns d'Artagnan
confident smirk -- expression vanishes
young Gascon executes nearly impossible leap
join him.
And battle, clash swords kind
music now, men, exuberance, bright morn-
ing combined dazzlingly heroic display. Just
then: The haycart crosses wooden plank bridge. Girard
backs d'Artagnan's sword, weak exhaustion,
stumbles. D'Artagnan man knows it. He
prepares blow --
-- And haycart shifts, deposits men

antidote glorious swordplay.
