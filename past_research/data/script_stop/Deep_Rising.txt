3 SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 3
The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches DLD laser tracking
barks one-word questions JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors
work consoles clipped monosyllabic answers. The
JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS charts electronic
position board, contiuously-shifting graphic representation
ocean contours below. Behind elaborate
DEPTH GAUGE computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet
dropping. The Crew works fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS
depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes depth
gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.
4 ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4
The excitement builds. Even Captain's weathered eyes
widen. And then, depth gauge hits 35,801 feet
sea level, entire Crew breaks CHEERS, WHOOPS,
HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.
CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

THE SHINKAI hovers near gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC
ARM extends plexi-dome. Its "hand"
high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches plate, steadies,
fires direct BLUE BEAM bedrock, burns rock
magma cuts perfect round pattern.
Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, CLAW rips
cut rock inside pattern, takes sample
sets inside hydro-basket submersible's port side.
DISSOLVE TO:

The MUSIC builds.
The Shinkai approaches embankment. Slowly starts glide
side. The Captain Science Officers mesmerized
lonely creepiness. They crest embankment. And
plexi-domed VIEW FILLS unimaginable horror.
As far eye see, entire murky landscape
filled WHALE BONES. A valley death. Cluttered

CUT TO:
13 SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT 13
Everything outside plexi-dome BLACK. Everyone
staring position board, shows large section
OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, contours incongruous
rest graphic representation.
The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks
commands. The Crew leaps high gear.
Then Captain reverses trottle, petal-to-the-metal
starts out.
The inky blood swirls past plexi-dome. Then suddenly,
impossibly, SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes
ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS
BREAKS. Lots YELLING Japanese.
The SHINKAI starts ROCK SHAKE. Something hold
it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men thrown about. Then
stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead
quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND
HEARD coming exterior ship, like feet runing
outside hull. Very creepy.
The HULL starts MOAN CREAK UNSEEN PRESSURE.
And sub begins crushed like it's beer can.
The metal HULL TORQUES sides. RIVETS POP SNAP.
WATER SPRAYS SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING
DIMPLES, CRUMBLES SCREAMS agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.

TRILLIAN

FINNEGAN

He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, leaps

looks watch.
CUT TO:
149 SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT 149
Finnegan bursts in.
FINNEGAN
Pantucci!... JOEY!
Then spots floor. He reaches
picks up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's
RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares it. His grip tightening.
Tears rising eyes. His jaw clenching. Then flings
belt aside. Filled rage.
FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

Finnegan hits ignition button. A desperate moment dry
cranking ...and remaining engine catches,
sputters, fires life.

Finnegan pops surface. Looks around. Can't
Trillian. He DIVES water. His POV: Tentacles
converging murky depths. The "retrieve"
feature that's jet skis forces
Finnegan Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST
surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet
ski heads right them. Finnegan swims it. Dragging
Trillian. As tentacles converge sides.
The JET SKI suddenly SUCKED water! Swallowed
whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The
WARHEAD SLICES water. Now meters away
hitting Fuji Maru.
Now meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.

The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.
METAL FLIES.
WATER SPRAYS.
FIRE FILLS night sky. The TOP DECK Fuji Maru
CARTWHEELS waves. The Tentacle Finnegan
drops like lead. And lies there. Quivering. Another
EXPLOSION. LIFTS remains FUJI MARU sea.

Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards island.
Pulling Trillian. The remains SAIPAN FUJI MARU
SMOLDER SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE surface.
A couple dozen small FIRES dot waves. WATER SIZZLES
STEAMS. SMOKE drifts night sky. Debris coats
water.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
155 BEACH - SUNRISE 155
Finnegan Trillian crawl water
beach island.
They collapse other. Finnegan exhausted.
Trillian coughs seawater. They turn look
sea, rising sun. Trillian reaches bra,
pulls egg sized diamond. She holds up. The sun
refracts brilliantly...
Trillian looks diamond, looks picture
perfect island, picture perfect sunset...and
heaves far sea. For time
know around. No people.
No tentacles. And look other,
comes mind survival.
Finnegan moves Trillian. Trillian moves
Finnegan. Their lips closer, closer...
And then, feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
WATER! Scares shit them. The audience too.
But it's Pantucci. Looking waterlogged shell-
shocked. Coughing half sea. Finnegan Trillian help
feet.
PANTUCCI

PANTUCCI

And head gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,
teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like sound
animal thing we've hear beofre. Coming DEEP
WITHIN THE ISLAND.
PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
Or maybe not...
Finnegan, Trillian, Pantucci slowly turn look INLAND.
We BEGIN TO PULL BACK stand up. MORE STRANGE
NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES.
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING creepy-looking
island. And leaving heroes stranded beach.
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces smoldering
ship. Nearly island VISIBLE now. Dark jungles.
Craggy mountains. Maybe scariest-looking place earth.
FINNEGAN (V.O.)
What now...
The "THING" ROARS again. It's hellacious.
AND WE CUT TO BLACK.
THE END
