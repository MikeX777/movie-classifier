source couple stories.
Kenny paces gathered men President's

RUSK
The FBI identified Alexander
Fomin Soviet Resident, KGB
equivalent station chiefs.
He's highest ranking spy
country. And knows John's friend
mine.
BUNDY

overture.
Kenny eyes Bundy, makes uncomfortable. The President
sizes Scali up.
THE PRESIDENT
So they'll remove missiles,
we'll pledge invade Cuba,
destabilize Castro assist
plans so...
Nobody dares speak. It's possibility
settlement vanish air moves.
BOBBY
I think... real
message Khruschev.
MCCONE
The alternative, Mr. President,
trap.
KENNY
Dangle settlement, tie
negotiations, come short...
MCCONE
Why approach

brings honest broker.
MCCONE
That want think.
RUSK
The truth is, Mr. President, don't

INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT
Kenny slams page Khruschev's letter table. He
jabs finger it. EXCOM listens, intent.
KENNY
It's pages sentimental fluff,

pledge. It looks like Fomin's overture
genuine.
The President turns McCone.
MCCONE
Our early analysis says
probably written Khruschev himself.
It's draft, shows signs
polished foreign
ministry. In fact, probably hasn't
approved Politburo. They
wouldn't let emotionalism

EXCOM chuckles.
THE PRESIDENT
Glad hear we're alone.
The President eyes EXCOM members one, incipient

Half EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, Taylor

Kenny sits hurriedly, shucks coat joins
conversation mid-stream.
MCCONE
My specialists agreement:
morning's letter Khruschev. Last
night's letter was.
(beat)
The evidence supports
conclusion: coup,
Khruschev replaced overnight.
KENNY
Jesus Christ...
Bobby gives look: told things got worse.
THE PRESIDENT

RUSK
It doesn't necessarily mean there's
coup. Khruschev's signed

MCNAMARA
Aw, come on, Dean!
RUSK
But least... It suggest
he's co-opted hard line
elements.
MCNAMARA
Which end day
thing coup. A puppet Khruschev,
hard-line Soviet government
pulling strings. No deal. And
missiles operational.
Bitter silence. They look President. Imminent

THE PRESIDENT
You know, problem

Our Jupiters scheduled removal

They'll gun head again,
expect pay again.
Kenny looks President eye.
KENNY

The President sighs face stern advice. He

THE PRESIDENT
So geniuses tell

GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
It's possible back-channel
overture, night's letter,

Soviets said along,
lie -- disinformation.
MCNAMARA

Kenny hears fatalism McNamara's voice. A long beat.
Everyone stares McNamara.

A pall falls room LeMay explains.
LEMAY
FROGS, 'em. Short range
