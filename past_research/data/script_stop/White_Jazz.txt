(closes file)
Since I misjudged Cop I thought

ME (V.O.)
Seen Pete dozen times
time thought:
Pete suddenly puts left hook: hammers
Diskant pass. Instant-ugly crumble.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
God help hits like
that.
Pete hoists Diskant waist-band, tosses
backseat. I accelerate out, obeying law.
CUT TO:
PITCH BLACK. Then series strobe-flashbulbs: maybe flesh,
maybe bodies, maybe hairy/pale. Then groaning,
flickering fluorescent lights look jaundiced.
13 INT. LOW RENT FUCK-TEL ROOM - SAME MOMENT 13
Lights now. Diskant awake, trying loosen jaw.
18.

19.
Wait big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.

punches, anything...but doesn't. I turn Junior:
ME (CONT'D)
Take Quiff home.
QUIFF

ME
-of course is.
Junior pulls Quiff door. By hand. Just Pete, Me,

85 EXT. TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT 85
Pull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights low inside.
99.
86 EXT./INT. BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER 86
The door opens. She's dressed bed. I don't hesitate,
afraid she'll shun me. Move her, doesn't startle. An
arm waist, drawing in, mouth close hers.
I face hand, check eyes, beat
tell it's okay...I lean in, takes lifetime...and
kiss soft kisses back, mouth moving
split lips, puts hands face, pulling in.
She feels exactly like I imagined.
My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving
bed back. I stop, pull back, moonlight moves
shoulders. I whisper:
ME
...tell I'm rough.
Tears squeezed smiling eyes, kisses
harder, pulls her. We love like we've
touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.
Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes away.
I escape her. Hours fall. I stay forever...
87 INT. BEDROOM - LATER 87
Lying there, staring her. A silence peace I've
known. Not once.
ME
Tell anything. Tell
everything.
Label surprise, brow furrows unfurrows

GLENDA BLEDSOE
`For profit -- mostly.'
Silence. A feeling like: `and are...'
ME

GLENDA BLEDSOE
Me neither.
She touches quake. Two breaths hand
goes quiet: shakes, images, fear. She
takes head, pulls bare breasts. The things
audible: breathing, clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.
BLACK.
Wake quiet, look Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit slow.
Look her, sleeping, stare. I lean down, kiss
lightly, taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's
good thing you'll today.
88 INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M. 88

BRADLEY

BRADLEY
I'll issue A.P.B. saying

pain like boiling oil moves blood.
JUNIOR STEMMONS

Junior, .45 pulled, head.
JUNIOR STEMMONS
I hope Bledsoe whore worth

crooked cop, think small.
Koenig reads file's page, lifts it...a blank page
behind...and one...
ME (V.O.)
Whatever moves I left...I
made.
Koenig spins back, blank pages spilling file.
KOENIG
This isn't it!
-Junior looks: that's I need. Pull pig-sticker
ankle corkscrew calf, twisting. Junior bleats
slaughtered-lamb I reach wrench gun free. Grab

shots head.
Haul dead tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand
flashes shoulder. Shoot twice. He goes
gargling `fuck'. Stand-up sea-legs, bad wobble/weave
I slowly pull knife side, pocket it. Feel blood
flow saturate pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes I
approach Koenig.
He pulls sitting position, shaking head.
This bemused, beaten, half-grin flicks blood
hand like fingers brushed sticky.
KOENIG
Poorly played Dave...poorly
played...
Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal
clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, odd squint, like bum
beg change.
KOENIG
Could I talk something?
Cut something?
119.
Give hope.
ME
Won't work Fritz.
He nods, remorse, resignation...it looks now.
KOENIG
Give minute then?
I do. Watch hands removes shoes, waiting
ankle grab, back-up piece...none comes. He sets shoes
aside, gazing starless sky issuing
short, gruff laugh...some inside joke die untold.
KOENIG
(with nod)
Okay...
...and holds breath completely content
I shoot him. Cross Junior now, rifle clothes,
retrieve hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE -

She frames face hands.
GLENDA
I don't believe you.
Lies leak, expose. The silence makes
guilty. She lets hook, head arm, leaning
in. I kiss her.
GLENDA (CONT'D)
(at whisper)
Was I worth this?
ME
Whatever cost.
GLENDA
Just like then?
ME
Just like that.
A nod. An understanding. Another kiss, I'll
remember.

without. Someday I'll
know I'm looking."
126.
I stand quiet, `grief' best word enough.
Choke tears I lift Pete's camera black
white picture you've seen before.
Put jacket on, pull paper pocket Pete
planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...
FLASHBACK TO:
PETE

RETURN TO:
104 INT. LAX - MORNING 104
A Times vending machine: paper blazing page photos
wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past old face. Past
Cops Feds camped out, looking me.
ME (V.O.)
Pete's penance beating built
brand new face...nobody gives
second glance...not cops I
recognize.
Up TWA counter: glance departures board-
BLACK.
Legend: Recife, Brazil, 1978
105 INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING 105
I'm old. Stare leather-tan, once-broken face
gilded mirror. The breaks occurred lifetime ago, healed
uneven. I start pack suitcases. Old files think
seen before. An old gun know you've seen before.
Movements slow steady advancing age...
ME (V.O.)
My remember. My confession
complete. Still enough.

Then week-old Times place

Face eternal-beautiful...
Put photo chest pocket. Push week-old Times
