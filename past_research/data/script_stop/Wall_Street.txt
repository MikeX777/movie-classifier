INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting session:
400 stockholders -- middle aged older,
bag lady. Cromwell sits elevated platform
room surrounded army bulky EXECUTIVES,
weighing 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS
LAWYERS. Gekko contrast like Robin Hood seated
Alex, Harold, Bud stockholders. Cromwell
delivering prepared attack Gekko highly
sarcastic, gruff manner.
CROMWELL
...Your company, ladies
gentlemen, siege
Gordon Gekko.
Teldar Paper leveraged
hilt, like piss poor South
American country...instead
cash build plants, build
business, man wants
paid withdraw
tender offer cost
approximately $200 million
greenmail passed
consumer...
Gekko seething, jumps up.
GEKKO
Where speaking
like that, making remarks
press, I resent remarks, I
demand right speak.
CROMWELL
Sit down, sir, you're order,
haven't damage
Teldar is?...have
sense decency?
(to shareholders)
How management...
Gekko urged sit people hear
catcalls, "Let man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"
CROMWELL (CONT'D)
...concentrate long term growth
we're busy fighting get-
rich-quick, short term profit, slot
machine mentality Wall Street
fighting Japan!
The original fundamental reason
Wall Street capitalize
American business, underwrite new
business, build companies, build
America. The "deal"
succeeded goods services
America's gross national product
process,
undermining foundation. This
cancer called "greed". Greed
speculation replaced long-term
investment. Corporations
taken apart like erector sets,
consideration
public good. I strongly recommend
Mr. Gekko's
shameless intention
strip company severely
penalize stockholders. I
strongly recommend reject
tender voting
management's restructuring
stock.
CUT TO:
Gekko floor level microphone. He's calmer,
makes pitch stockholders, looking
management.
GEKKO
...I appreciate chance you're
giving me, Mr. Cromwell,
single largest stockholder
Teldar, speak.
(gets laughter
applause, loosens)
On way today I saw
bumper sticker. It said, "Life
bitch... die".
(gets laugh)
...well ladies gentlemen, we're
indulge fantasies,
political economic
reality. America
second rate power. Our trade
deficit fiscal deficit
nightmare proportions. In days
'free market'
country industrial power,
accountability
shareholders. The Carnegies,
Mellons, man built
industrial empire, sure
money stake.
Today management stake
company. Altogether guys
sitting total
3% Mr.
Cromwell million dollar
salary? Certainly Teldar
stock, owns 1%.
You Teldar Paper,
stockholders,
royally screwed
bureaucrats steak
lunches, golf hunting trips,
corporate jets, golden
parachutes! Teldar Paper 33
different vice presidents
earning $200,000 year. I
spent months analyzing
guys I can't
figure out.
(a big laugh)
Cromwell pissed.
CROMWELL
This outrage Gekko! You're
shit!
GEKKO
One thing I know paper
company lost $110 million
year, I'd bet half
paperwork going
forth vice
presidents...
(increased laughter,
he's getting them)
The new law evolution
corporate America
'survival unfittest'. Well
book, right
eliminated. Teldar Paper
doomed fail. Its
diversification casualty
insurance worked. Its crown
jewels trees, rest
dross. Through wars, depressions,
inflations deterioration
paper money, trees kept
value, Teldar chopping
down. Forests
perishable, forest rights
important human rights
planet, illusory
Maginot lines, scorched earth
tactics, proxy fights, poison
pills, etc. Mr.
Cromwell going come
prevent people like
buying Teldar Paper doomed
fail line,
ladies gentlemen,
know, way stay
strong create value, that's
buy stock, up.
If there's reason, I've
hear it.
(laughter)
That's I'm saying...it's
people company,
them, work they've
lousy job it. Get rid
fast, sick
die. I opportunist,
clowns better
job, I'd work. In
seven deals I've in,
2.3 million stockholders
actually pretax profit
$12 billion. When I bought
Ixtlan Corporation
exact position Teldar
today -- I turned
companies private I sold
--
companies, liberated
suffering conglomerate
prospered. I destroyer
companies, I liberator them.
The point is, ladies gentlemen,
greed good. Greed works, greed
right. Greed clarifies, cuts
through, captures essence
evolutionary spirit. Greed
forms, greed life,
money, love, knowledge, marked
upward surge mankind --
greed, mark words -- save
Teldar Paper
malfunctioning corporation
called USA...Thank you.
Much applause sits. Now standing ovation; shouts
approval. Cromwell knows lost day, tries
continue meeting calling "order".
Bud watches, impressed.
