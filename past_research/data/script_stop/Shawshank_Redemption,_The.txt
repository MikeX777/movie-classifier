Frank Darabont
Based story
Rita Hayworth Shawshank Redemption
Stephen King
1 INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946)
A dark, room.
The door bursts open. A MAN WOMAN enter, drunk
giggling, horny hell. No sooner door shut
they're other, ripping clothes, pawing
flesh, mouths locked together.
He gropes lamp, tries turn on, knocks
instead. Hell it. He's got urgent things do, like
getting blouse open hands breasts. She
arches, moaning, fumbling fly. He slams
wall, ripping skirt. We hear fabric tear.
He enters right there, roughly,
wall. She cries out, hitting head wall
caring, grinding him, clawing back, shivering
sensations running her. He carries
room legs wrapped him. They fall bed.
CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting window, traveling
smoothly outside...
2 EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2
...to reveal bungalow, remote wooded area,
lovers' cries spilling night...
...and drift wooded path, sounds rutting
passion growing fainter, mingling night sounds
crickets hoot owls...
...and begin hear FAINT MUSIC woods, tinny
incongruous, PULLING BACK until...
...a car revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked clearing.
3 INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3
ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit.
Under normal circumstances respectable, solid citizen; hardly
dangerous, meek. But circumstances far
normal. He disheveled, unshaven, drunk. A
cigarette smolders mouth. His eyes, flinty hard,
riveted bungalow path.
He hear fucking here.
He raises bottle bourbon knocks back. The radio
plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him:
You stepped dream...
You wonderful...
To seem...
He opens glove compartment, pulls object wrapped
rag. He lays lap unwraps carefully --
-- revealing .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil.
He grabs box bullets. Spills everywhere,
seats floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets lap,
loading gun, one, methodical grim.
Six chamber. His gaze goes bungalow.
He shuts radio. Abrupt silence, distant
lovers' moans. He takes shot bourbon courage,
opens door steps car.
4 EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4
His wingtip shoes crunch gravel. Loose bullets scatter
ground. The bourbon bottle drops shatters.
He starts path, unsteady feet. The closer
gets, louder lovemaking becomes. Louder
frenzied. The lovers reaching climax, sounds
passion degenerating rhythmic gasps grunts.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Oh god...oh god...oh god...
Andy lurches stop, listening. The woman cries
orgasm. The sound slams Andy's brain like icepick. He
shuts eyes tightly, wishing sound stop.
It finally does, dying away like siren that's left
shallow gasping panting post-coitus. We hear
languorous laughter, moans satisfaction.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Oh god...that's sooo good...you're
best...the best I had...
Andy stands listens, devastated. He doesn't look like
killer now; he's sad little man dirt
path woods, tears streaming face, loaded gun
held loosely side. A pathetic figure, really.

comes sputtering breath. The water waist-deep.
He wades upstream, ripping clothes body. He gets
shirt off, spins air head, flings
