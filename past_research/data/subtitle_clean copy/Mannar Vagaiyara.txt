Greetings brother!
Rajangam,you had given a bound book
instead of a invitation.
Yes brother,
If any of the relatives name goes

So printed out all the names.
Okay,good!
Be seated brother.
(Chanting Mantras)
Greetings!
Welcome Uncle!
After a span of 27 years,
all the relationships are conjoined today.
I feel so happy.
Uncle,you are the reason
 behind this marriage.
If my brother comes now,
that's enough for me!
I too wish the same,Uncle.
It must be the same as our marriage.
When everyone has come
for his son's marriage,
Won't he come?
Right.
He'll come.
Be happy.
Aunt,
Yes.
Shall we sort out the gifts to be given?
Yes...
Be seated,Uncle.

Call the elder son.
Ask him when he comes?
Okay.

A few months before...
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Hmm...

written his law exams
and coming forth successfully.
Sir,paper sir.
Paper sir.
Sir,where are you?
Come on...
Come on...
Brother did the exams amazing!
Answer sheets was not sufficient.
When others get answer sheets,
he was getting more number of pens.
He is doing wonders!
It doesn't seem that brother
writes exam to be a lawyer,
It's like as a judge,
he writes a judgement to the society.
Call the oldsters.
Play the music.
"A ballad needs mount of words,"
"You are so forth generation
of King's in Pattukotai!"
"We hang around singing lullaby,"
"But came to tune an onset ballad to you,"
Sing! Sing now!

"We can drive without licence,"
"Upsurge the sound of  silencer,"
"Stand bold even if the poilce comes near,"
"State the name of our kin,"
"A bout for bout,"
"A ballad for a ballad,"
"Tie the swaddling clout"
"We're the so forth generation
of the King's!"
Dude,look at there.
Tamarind sack dances wearing your brief.
If you ask me,
I would've bought you trousers.
Slashed...
"What may happen to the law,
If you are not there?"
"It becomes a temple without deity,"
"If I wear a vest or tonsure my head,
I won't do without your consent."
"Though you do blunders,that's right."
"As granny told,the crow looks white."
"We'll pounce if anyone question us,"
"We'll act in home as if we are good,"
"We'll be the saviours of our hamlet,"
"We'll offer to whoever is in need!"
"We're the so forth generation of the King's!"
Hmm...
Bro,
Just a single BGM,
we'll adjust.
Hmm.
Okay!
Okay!
"A locus theatre,a locus sweet of honey,"
"Shall we taste together!"
"We're as pure as gold!
"Roaring lions!"
"Don't seduce us,go away."
"It's a bare land to play,"
"Cuddle and play,"
"Don't butch the goat before..."
"You spoil the chore and trying to rush away, "
"I accept that you are honest,"
"erstwhile a couple of vessels were burgled"
I do accept,
I do accept that your mother is a naive.
Meet you next time.
Greetings!
Thank you!
Brother!
Yes brother!
We'll complete the final BGM and go to home.
"We're the so forth generation
of the King's!"
He gets caught.
Dad!
What's all this?
To whom is the reception?
Who has come?
It's me!
Where did you go,
to come back?
To write the exams.
Oh!
Hey,when did you come?
When do you left?
How are you?
You have come soon.
Question paper was so easy.
Is it to lift?
To write...
You are talking to dad with coolers,
Don't you know the respect?
Take it.
It's okay, who were all these guys?
Are they your classmates?
They are the drummers.
Oops!
What does he say?
They are asking for money.
Just wait.
Isn't it waste of money?
When my younger is at fault,
it's my duty as a elder
to take care of him.
I expected this goof,
I have money with me.
I'll give dad.
Hey... hey...
What's the stuff now?
Happiness!
Hey...hey...
Hmm...
No sound must emanate
till you cross the street.
Go away.
Tell them to go.
Go away.
Hey,don't you have respect?
Hey,do you act as if good?
Hey...hey...
What happened now?
They crossed the street!
What?
Don't know why they vigourously
 beat the drums today?
You completed the studies,
so what's up next?
Hmm,
Hmm.
Mathi!
Hey!
Oh!
What happened?
Why do you cry?
Mathi,why do you cry?
Tell us the reason.
Unless I know the reason,
I won't allow you to take food.
Be quite,Arivu.
Tell now.
I'm going to be a lawyer.
Everyone in our house
has done a degree course.
Born into this family,
he failed tenth grade and
not ashamed to dine.
Tears roll on when I
think of him,dad.
Does tears roll on?
What to do?
He is not able to study.
For that?
Shall we leave him free?
When younger brother
scored poor in studies,
Uncle punished him
and made him to study better.
Conjoined,leave this to me.
I'll pounce his moss and mocker
and make him to get a degree soon.
Is it a must to study in such a way?
What's that you ask?
Do you know why god
grant us a pair of eyes?
For what?
One is to perceive,
 and the other one is to read.
Oh...
Listen to him.
When listening to him,
I desire to join a school now.
How does he eat
without any responsibility?
Hey...
Tamarind sack...
You don't worry.
I'll pounce and
push him to get a degree.
Hey,he won't thwart hunger,
How will he combat if you pounce?
It's good,that he must study.
But handle him smooth.
Yes mom.
Mom!
Hey...hey...
Hey,where are you going?
He goes to buy books.
Where do you rush?
Wait, I'll come.
Where does he go?
He goes to buy a rope,
to tie him and pounce.
He made me not to eat.
Sir,
-What does he say?
why did you do this?
What I did?
What I did?
As you look fair,
 I expected you are educated.
Huh!
I'll tear you.
Everyone is pestering at me.
Go away.
Mom!
Yes.
Where is Uncle?
Mom,to receive me from college,
brother,friends
and even relatives has come.
Why didn't uncle come?
Tell me,why didn't he come?
You had written the law exams,
so afore you get the results,
In order to get the entire village
under his control
He left the house,
Where will he be now?
You must've seen "Actor Raghuvaran" as
slim,fair and a tall personality,
But you wouldn't have seen
 a fat, dark and short person...
What?
You must've seen "Raghuvaran" as

I just broiled with her.
Where are you,uncle?
Leave that.
How did you write the exams?
Uncle,really amazing!
A person in front of me is having
a long moustache,
what's the case for it?
A long moustache itself is a case.
See now,how I'm going to clench it?
Oh no,uncle!
You dare to talk with this moustache.
If slothful,how the entire
zone will be under our control?
Go and do your best.

Do you know my history?
You too have a history?
Okay, I'll ask you a query
from your history.

Thanjavur Rajarajan and Madurai Ramarajan,
But you have a turf and a history behind it?

Hey,stop it.
You has come here getting
a job from government.
Without knowing about
the status of the zone,
will you do marriage for them?
Then you give information

…and gives poise to the photos.
We are the relatives for generations
to take care of all the goodwill.
Just do your work and get the salary.
Don't make me to come

SHRIMP FARM, KOVILOOR
PATTUKOTTAI TALUK.
Hey,
untie the ropes.
It's the complaint
you gave to the collector.
Check whether
it's right.
Read it with the same anger...
...when you had at the time
of giving the complaint.
Request to closure
of the prawns farm.
Koviloor Karunakaran,
For the last fifteen years,
In 300 acres of land
is cultivating Shrimps farm.
The wastage from the
shrimps farm is affecting
the fertility of the neighbouring lands.
Then?
Last year when we protested,
The farmers were fiercely
thrashed by Karunakaran.
Moreover,
the complaint filed on him is
at mute for past eight months.
As a collector,
you have to save us and
our agricultural lands.
We request you
to do this favour.
Hey,
when you can't save yourself...
...you thrive to save agriculture.
Who is beneath you?
He is Kanthangudi Govindaraj Mooriyar
Owner of Coconut market.
If he bawl here,
will it be audible to him?
Give the iron lynch.
Fizzle out now.
No...
No...
It's painful.
Don't thrash us.
We beg you.
Leave us.
Leave us.
Tell the clan to wait
who comes from the society.
Yes,
I'll tell.
Brother,
Yes dear.
Brother is like a temple.
Yes,
yes.
Yesterday it was
 your father,
Today it's your brother.
Be silent.
Bro,
I want Rs.5000 now.
For what?
We are going on
 tour from college.
Lord!
Take it.
Brother is not a temple.
Hmm.
You switched over as soon as
you got the money.
Brother,you are my god!
Go safe.
Selvarani,keep it.
Why brother?
You don't ask for anything.
Keep it.
Hmm.

No chance at all.
Hmm...
He won't go without informing me.
How he went?
And why he went?
Mandiramoorthy,

To inform you wherever he goes.
No...
What no?
He told me clearly.
About what?
To come home
at the time of breakfast.
He told that we will discuss
the things by dining.
Oh!
Now the problem is not
that sir went to Bombay.
But the breakfast!
Take it.
Either you eat
and go or go and eat.
Mandiramoorthy,don't forget to
get the plate tomorrow.
Aah...
Why do you insist him to come?
How many times to tell you that
our daughter must marry my nephew?
Both the families are
not even in communication.
But you are dreaming of blues!
It will happen.
I have hope.

Hmm.
She said she is in hurry.
That's all.
The priest told her to go to
another temple,if in hurry.
Then?
Is it release of actor Ajith's movie?
To go to another theatre,if not here?
Yes.
She came weeping.
You know well.
I create arson just for a hand shake.

Frenzied out.
Hmm.
I went straight to temple,
I adhered my hands with that of priest.
Just a small twist.
Then?
Bloodshed in his hand!
It's a fracture.

He told me to go with the deity
 first and he'll follow me.
As he was panic,

Govindaraj Mooriyar,Head of Agricultural society,
Pattukottai taluk,
has filed a public welfare case
against Karunakaran of Koviloor.

Shrimps farm cultivated by Karunakaran,
...is polluting the fertile lands.
Still how many days to hide?
I'll consummate everything today.
Is there any notion in your kit?
No.
Then how?
Notion emerges impromptu
when looking at his face.
See how I'll manage with that...
Hey...
Sir,when talking about a piety,
a good personality stands in front of me.
Sir,I learnt a deterrent example from you.
What's that?
Mala is very fraud.
Who? She?
Hmm.
She says phone is here and there.
Finally,she has given the phone in the shop.
Why she must give the phone in shop?
Known that you are more familiar in Pattukottai.
Is it?
Hmm.
She said that she'll return the
phone after service of it as it's VIP's.
I never heard of this in my experience.
I asked the same query to her.
For that she replied...
Tell me.
It's a terrific comedy,
if you listen to it.
When we get pulses to flour mill,
they were broken into fine flour.
So,you had broken the phone.

The backlash will be worst.
Won't you subdue still?
Get me to the shop.

But I came alone to lock
the coconut market.
Let him get the keys

A brawl in Shrimps farm.
Why do you get into brawl?
Didn't my brother come?

Don't know still how long
he'll carry on the angst.
When the good time may come?
It'll come.
It'll come.
Don't worry.
Uncle!
Kalaiyarasi only stumbles
for relationships.
Her brother invited everyone
for Karuna's marriage,
But didn't even utter a word to us.
You too didn't invite us for
brother-in-law's marriage.
We thought of inviting...
You repeat the same.
You say they didn't give the invitation,
He says you didn't
invite for the marriage.
What's the solution if you
extend on the words.
You are looking for a bridegroom
to your elder daughter.
He is searching for a bride to his brother.
Both of you discuss and decide
about their marriage and invite all.
Is it okay?
Don't cry.

If you are bold enough,talk to us.
Listen carefully,
We'll seize them both
wherever they may be.
What are you looking at?
Hey...
Stay back and talk.
Mooriyar,stay back.
Stay back and talk.
Elder guy is better than him.
Being afraid,
he gorged poison.
But the younger guy
He abducted selvarani
And got her married.
We mustn't leave him idle.
It's a festival today
in their village.
The whole village will be at temple.
Abduct him.
I'll take care of
whatever is the result.
Ok, brother - in - law
The auspicious pole can be laid
after six months only.
Auspicious time for bridegroom.
Starts after eight months
That's why I say,
it's possible only after six months.
Can't we proceed it afore?
We are blood relatives,
If there is any remedy
we can rectify that and proceed.
We mustn't do
the auspicious event on compulsion.
If we do so?
I mustn't say it.
But for your sake I'm telling it.
If you proceed against it,
A life will be departed.
What do you say?
Yes,if you proceed against it,
a life will be departed.
Past,because of our urgency
we are at this stance.
It's good to abide by astrologer.
Your decision is exactly right, sir.
If you proceed against it,
a life will be departed.
We'll go by his words.
Let the marriage be after
six months or a year.
I've to discuss an important
subject to you.
Tell me
None of your family members
should be in touch...
...with the family of your elder sister.
I'll lynch Mathi in future
Then it won't be good
if you prefer their relationship.
if anything happens so.
I'll send back your younger
sister at the earliest,
I would've told you on the day
of engagement,
But I curb my tongue
as it's not decency.
I promise you that even
my dog won't go there.
If you don't have faith,
I'll make a promise in front of family deity.
Your word is enough to me.
Bala speaking,
Where are you?
We are in hospital.
What happened?
Priya, a missed girl is at the audio room.
We request her parents to come here.
Again I repeat...
He must know the reflex
if he intrude in JP family.
If he is brother-in-law of JP,
is he a big doyen?
I'll pounce him if I see him today.
How dare he yells at dad?
What you say is right.
They may entrap to your anger.
What?
Look at there.
Search everywhere.
Tamarind sack, give me your cloth,
We'll enjoy it today.
He shouldn't be missed.
It's true that god is there.
What do you want?
Announce this.
You leave,I'll read it.
The JP clan searching for Mathi,
Don't go anywhere.
Come near to the pond at the temple.
Mathi is waiting for you.
Don't oversee right and left
Come soon.
Come on.
He must breathe his last today.
Uncle, he is afraid as you
yelled at his father.
He signals you to go aside.
You be aside,
I'll breach at him.
Hey...
Hey, what are you thinking about?
You arretsed the one who were beaten
but left the one who hit them.
Come with me.
Hey,sit down.
Hey
On that day
You created ruckus in police station
for the marriage of some other girl.
Now,he abducted your sister.
If you are bold enough,hold his shirt.
Hey,what do you blabber?
Dude,we'll leave.
We'll leave.
At this situation
the police will only support him.
Look after the  marriage works,
I'll lynch Mathi.
Come.
Listen to me.
Your countenance must be pityful.
You too brother.
I'll go home earlier
By the time you come
I'll enact the play before dad.
How?
Are you a elder son?
You must chide me if I'm at fault.
But you do everything.
Rogue.
Rogue.
You can chide me straight away
if you wish.
It's my performance before dad
for your goodness.
Ever our family even went
by the side of police station?
But you made
our dad to go to police station.
Are you human?
You gorged toxicant...
Don't want to tell that incident.
Mom and aunt will cry.
It's a matter of sentiment.
It'll work.
Listen to me.
Do parents bear
if anything happens to you?
Do I bear if parents suffer?
Do family bear if I suffer?
Without any knowledge of this,
you got married!
Get lost, dog.
Dog!
I'll yell at you in this manner.
Immediately dad will say that,
Shut your mouth
You dare to yell
at elder brother without respect.
My child,you get in as couple.
He will ask you to get in.
You imitate as dad.
I know his attitude
As well as his voice.
I'll go.
Come,we'll go.
Come little bit late.
Why?
It must be a live performance
though scripted.
First, I'll get ready.
How did you select him?
Hope all his notion may work out.
Brother.
Brother.
Hey, stop there.
How dare you come here?
Do you know,his name
was spoiled because of you?
Are you a elder brother?
Do you know the stance
of elder brother?
Half part of dad and
other half of mom!
Good dialogue
Aren't you ashamed to be here?
Get lost.
What do you say?
Dad, is it right?
Yes, perfectly right.
Dad!
Go out.
Go...
What do you say?
Born in this family, he ditched us.
Gorged poison.
Go...
Brother, he is pityful.
If anyone converse more than this,
I'll go out of this house.
He told.
Go out.
Mathi!
what do you blabber?
Go...
Go...
He goes out.
Boss,a small hint.
Hey,shut up you mocker.
Dare to hint out to me.
Go away.
Go away.
Go aside.
Feed the cow at the backyard.
Where do you go?
Is the cow inside the house?
Go at the back.
Get her in.
Come sister.
Dude, get in.
I'll take care. Go
It happened contrary to my plan.
I must manage somehow.
Boss!
It's known now,
why the cow yields less quantity of milk.
Stop.
Why to stop?
Please stop.
Listen to me.
It's good performance.
You planned well and sent us out.
Can't you understand?
What I must understand?
When dad was talking,
can't you say that it's all your plan?
For what?
To send me out?
I can unify you only
if I stay in house.
I didn't expect dad's words.
Mathi
I'm worried to stay alone without you all.
Don't worry.
Everything happens for good.
If you are unified in our house,
Her household would've been insane.
If you are unified on her house
Our parents may resent.
It's the exact situation
To create a pity on you
So that you'll be unified
soon with families.
What Mathi says is right.
I've arranged for your stay
in my friend's house.
Be here.i'll come with the keys.
Will you come soon?
I'll come.
I must set right my brother's life.
You'll never change.
I know how to handle you.
At the family situation,
you use foul words.
I said it's money.
No...
Tell us something.
Why do you keep silent?
Hey Elayarani,
We can know only if you tell,
Tell us.
Hey
Go and talk to him.
Talk to him.
What's the subject Mathi?
I came to meet you.
What's the use of meeting?
My family decided to correct
the fault happened at my sister's marriage.
So engaged me for marriage.
You tell what I must do now?
Erstwhile,in marriage hall,
It's good if you've got me also
along with my sister.
It's good if you've got me also
along with my sister.
Nothing is going to happen.
I'm confident that we'll be together.
I don't have even a bit of confidence.
It's disheartening to both of us
if you come here.
Don't come here Mathi.
"Who is that personage?"
Who bequeath to?
"The wounds which never heals,"
"Who is that personage?"
"Who need to tell? "
"The solution to heal the wounds. "
Mathi, when you have time
please come to meet us.
You are the only relation to us.
"Will it amend?
Or will it go contrary?"
"The fate plays a ploy now,"
"Who is that personage?"
"Who bequeath to?"
"The wounds which never heal."
"Who is that personage?"
"Who need to tell? "

"Who bequeath to?"
"The wounds which never heals,"
"The relationships are far-flung,"
"The eyes are wet,"
"Will it amend?
Or will it go contrary?"
"The fate plays a ploy now."

It's not accident boss,
It's our plan.
Scoundrel
Don't you know what to play with?
We were horrified!
Nothing serious to you, right?
Witnessing the hardships of all of us,
Mathi planned it to unify us.
You would've told it afore he slapped me.
How do I know that he'll slap?
You look fair,
Hey, be quite.
but don't know anything...
Come
Mathi, come.

Why do you worry?
She is our daughter.

I'm very happy.
You saved me
when I gorged the poison.
You helped me to
marry the girl whom I loved.
You unified our families too.
As an elder I must do you all,
but though younger
you did me everything.
You are my brother.
Talking to me as if I'm a neighbour.
Only wish to me is
if a boy is born,
we'll call him by our dad's name.
If it's a girl,
we'll call by our mom's name.

We are afraid that you may not come.

Where did the younger son-in-law leave us?
He was calling all in the family from yesterday.
He doesn't know my
younger daughter's contact number.
If not, he would've called her also.
Why are you standing here?
Come in. Come.
A good example for the joint family!
How happy they are!
I'm also from a joint family.
Is it?
Yes!
That's why I'm so happy.
Who are all with you in the family?
It's me and my wife.
Parents of my wife.
Brothers of my wife.
Sisters of my wife.
Their Children.
And my sister-in-law,
All stay with me.
Do you know about of joint family?
Are you making fun of me?
Just now I told you in detail.
Are you a single person?
I'll tell you what's joint family.
If you build a house on your own,
And be with your parents,
brothers and sisters,
and making them to be happy
all along is the joint family.
Doesn't mean as joint family
if you join an already existing family.
Simply teasing elders and sisters-in-law there.
Everything has been well and good
What? Is it teasing of sister-in-law?
You are funny.
I'm telling you seriously.
Not only joint family,
How a family should be is shown now, watch it.
Whom do you mention?
"Colorful bangles,"
"Begets melody in cute hands,"
"Bless her..."
"Lustrous gold bangles,"
"Shines in hands,"
"Mount the bangles,"
"Recite him lily-white
words into his ears, "
"The tot heeds to will string to it,"
"A new dawn,on the earth,"
"Within petty days,

"A melody lullaby will devour in castle,"
"The entire region will collogue

"The cub of the lion arrives

"A melody lullaby will devour in castle,"
"The entire region will collogue

"The entire kinship will enjoin
about your son,"
Do we have difference in  community or status?
Why didn't any of your relatives has come?
Your elder son also didn't come.
We would've been happy if he has come
Not that, my son is against this marriage.
We planned our elder daughter's marriage
with my nephew.
That's why.
My husband and my brother
were childhood friends.
As they want that relationship intact,
They got married in both households.
After five years,
my sister-in-law committed suicide.
I lodged a police complaint
against him thinking
that he must have tortured
my sister and killed her.
Police filed a case and
imprisoned him for more than a year.
Later on,I was known that it's not the fault
of my brother-in-law
but my sister's
The moment we realised our mistake
we went to him to ask for forgiveness.
But he was not willing to see us.
So we planned to fix a match to
his son and my daughter,
But afore this marriage happened.
Now we have engaged
our younger daughter to my nephew.
She is going to be the
bridge to our affinity.
Don't cry.
Then what?
My brother's house is merely
a distance of 12km.
I haven't seen his countenance
for past 32 years.
Tears roll on when there is an emotional support.
You are also like my brother.
The marriage will happen in a good way.
Not only your both families,
we all three together will do this marriage.
Wipe your tears,don't cry.
Hi uncle,had food?
Dumped my belly.
Didn't you leave?
To where?
To house.
Why?
What do you say?
What dude?
Only part one of Bahubali was over.
Aah!
Second group of Bahubali is in search of me.
Oh!
Kattapa is on anger,
He'll mutilate me if get caught.
That's why didn't go to home
and roaming around.
What'll you do then?
Dude,they didn't go afraid of us,
In my absence, they went to
younger aunt's house.
As usual she was escaped.
Then they turned to elder aunt's house.
They asked me as soon as
they entered.
Hmm.
She replied that I went out.
Hmm.
They asked when I'll be back.
She said it's known only when he comes.
Is it?
They said to stay back till I come.
The beer they bought is in our fridge.
They ordered for egg omelettes
before the beer gets chilled.
Does she works in a restaurant?
No.
Someone in that clan asked
for pepper in the omelette.
She stared at them.
He threatened her.
Oh!
She borrowed spices to use to their taste.
She gave more than they asked for.
Don't they have that gratitude?
Yes.
After their enjoyment they must have left.
But someone asked her to dance.
Hmm.
She stared at them.
Why?
They tortoured her to dance.
She manage her best to be a wife.
They compelled her to dance.
Younger aunt is actor vijay's fan.
So she would've managed
with a couple of steps.
But elder aunt is actor Rajkiran's fan.
She can't dance at all.
She doesn't know to dance then?
No...
You simply ask as if
she doesn't know to cook?
She is a family woman.
You ask as if she is a slander.
Dude, will you pass in next
attempt of your exam?
Hmm.
Don't ponder, dude.
Your aunt's life will pass on
by preparing omelettes.
No uncle.
What I think is that it's good
to send aunt to dance class.
It's foolish to tell you my story.
They are far better than you.
I'll save my wife by apology to Kattappa.
Uncle,
What?
Exams.
Get lost.
You mulled me with it.
Kattappa, where are you?
I'm coming...
Easwari, come here.
What happened?
Will you eat something?
Why did you slap her?
What happened?
I left her not killing.
Why are you angry?
What happened?
What hasn't happened?
Everything is over.
What do you say?
Do you all went to elder
daughter's house?
I'm asking you,
Do you all went?
Yes.
She made our family ashamed.
I'm trying to make things right.
But you all went there and enjoyed.
Who told you?
Who?
Who told you?
So,it's not at fault you went there?
but you bother about who said me?
It's our fault to go
without informing you.
You may feel hurt if you are informed.
You would've get lost at the same way.
Shameless beings.
Do you all intake only food?
Hey, stop it.
You are talking unnecessarily.
What am I talking?
Shameless clan.
What happened now to yell at us?
Are you my father or am I your father?
All the three are my children.
Can I leave her alone if she desert us?
You can understand it only
when you come of my stance in future.
Leave it.
He talks in anger.
You talk to him equalising.
Be silent.
Will he talk rubbish in anger?
What happened now to yell at us?
Your nephew called me and said,
to cancel the marriage.
He tells the younger girl also to elope.
Then how about our daughter's marriage?
Leave it.
What the hell he says?
Isn't there any bridegroom
for my daughter?
I'll look after it.
He says determined.
Let him look after everything.
I won't interfere in any stuff.
What's this?
Uncle talks in temper.
Hey...
Just be calm.
That's the line of respect to you all.
What promise you made on that day?
Not even your pet dog
will go to that house.
But except your dog,
everyone in your house went there.
Don't stand out at my house.
If I go in now,it's a shame to you.
Go away afore I get in.
Mathi made me feel ashamed.
I mustn't leave him alive still.
He must be lynched at first.
Then only my brother-in-law will respect me.
He'll come to my house to marry my sister.
Hello,
Elayarani!
Tell me,
Where are you?
In college.
I'll convey you an incident.
Listen without panic.
What happened?
Just now I told you not to panic.
Okay, tell me
The bride groom engaged to you,
He...
Is he dead?
No,not to that extent.
His household rejected you as bride.
Sister-in-law!
Be qualm
How to be qualm?
It's difficult.
All of a sudden when you say,
what can I do?
What can I do?
Don't cry dear.
I'll try sister-in-law.
I'll try.
Too young to carry on.
I'm not worried about my brother,
Not worried about my him.
Are you free now?
Why?
Shall we enjoy a tune?
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"
"I'm not aghast of my father,"
"I'm not aghast of the clan,"
"I'm not aghast of the whole world,"
"I'm the rose, blossoms for you,"
"Lift me as you wish,"
"I'll go to my vicinity as mass,"
"You are my basha of love."
"Is your name Manickam,
lies as a secrecy to all?"
"Come on dear... Come on dear..."
"Come on..."
"Come on dear... Come on dear..."
"Come on..."
"You're the barnyard fowl,"
"I'm the sesame oil,"
"You cook as you wish,"
"I'll taste delicious."
"I felt gloomy as presumed
that you've forsaken me,"
"Hey dear, latched on to your hands now,"
"We have become a remix,"
"We'll bang sixes hereafter."
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"
"I'm not aghast of my father."
"Look out for a auspicious date,"
"Plant the poles for awning,"
"Serve a good menu on the leaf to the horde,"
"The garlands won't be withered "
"If anyone inquire us we'll heed to it,"
"When'll the drums bang?"
"When'll the beatitude abound?"
"Play the tune of the 'king of Music, Illayaraja'
and tie the knot,"
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"
"I'm not aghast of my father,"
"I'm not aghast of the clan,"
"I'm not aghast of the whole world,"
Selvarani,
Aunt!
Uncle asked for a cup of coffee,
didn't you give yet?
I'll give now.
He is the father-in-law not only to you,
But to me also.
Okay, be careful.
Hmm.
Will chill uncle by serving hot coffee.
Okay...okay...
Uncle, coffee.
I'm not habitual of  taking coffee.
Hello.
I'll talk to dad.
Don't worry.
Dad!
Mathi and Illayarani love each other.
Is it?
Yes,it is!
What must I do now?
Nothing to do dad.
It's enough if you agree.
If I agree?
We'll ask for formally.
If not?
If not,we'll abduct her.
Aah!
Is it okay,dad?
You go.
Tell him to come.
Hmm.
Go.
Happy dad.
Mathi,I spoke to dad.
He feels happy in soul.
But doesn't show off.
You go and talk to him.
Everything will be well and good.
Hmm.
Dad!
Yes, come.
What I know and your brother told,
Is all these the fact?
Yes dad.
Hey.
How long will you ruin a family?
Your brother slapped them
before they come out of it,
you are ready to slap next.
I would've sent you out of the house
on your brother's marriage.
As you saved your brother's life,
I left you and sent him out.
Hey,
as there is no girls as siblings,
you don't know the hardship.
On that day,Kalaiyarasi felt sad
about her relationship with brother.
It's still in my mind.
They are a affectionate family like our's.
Though the marriage you
did to your brother is at fault,
I felt happy when you unified
both the families
But it's clear now,you did everything
for your sake.
Dad,I promise.
It's not for my sake.
No...no...
I don't even brawl for fun.
Okay,
I'll initiate the marriage on my own effort.
Dad!
My son...
Arivu,before dad meets karunakaran,
I'll meet him and do Illayarani's
marriage as they wished.
It's rare that our wishes get fulfilled.
I'm not lucky enough for it.
If sheared,that must be done with my sickle.
Your anger is on me.
Don't stop your brother's marriage
enraged on me and my family.
My dad took action on your shrimp farm
as a good deed to the public.
But you smashed all our
persons including my uncle.
You closed the coconut market too.
In that enrage,
I brawled with you.
My brother gorged poison
and was struggling for life,
For his sake I abducted the bride.
If you were in the same situation,
you would've done the same.
That's what I too did.
It's a promise,
I doesn't know that both of your…
…families are getting unified
after a long span.
My family must not bear that sin.
I plead not to stop the marriage.
If you are still insane,
I’ll apologise to you.
Hey, why do you fall on my foot?
You are son of a respectful person.
When my dad pleads to me,
it's not a fault to fall on your foot.
Whether knowingly or not,
our both families
unified on the brawl with you.
We all together will make the
marriage a grand occasion.
Okay, I'll leave.
What's that wound?
It's caused by your brother-in-law.
Get that turmeric.
It's okay brother.
It's not painful.
I'll take care.
I'll leave.
Hey,
Brother.
Keep that sickle inside.
Why brother?
It'll be useful in future.
I can't understand brother.
Does he think of us as goofs?
If he apologise,do we leave him?
Let the marriage happen.
I'll lynch him at the entrance
of the marriage hall.
Shall we buy the coconut groove?
It's good...very much happy.
In-laws in phone.
How are you?
I'm happy that the marriage takes place.
So happy about it.
Everyone must attend the marriage.
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"
"An affinity born like a thread

"It's the happiness in this world!"
"Who's to whom is contend by
god after gambol of ploy,"
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"
"Though both hearts conjoin together,"
"Though both become an unitary soul,"
"The happiest ceremony,
the marriage doesn't happen to all,"
"The honorary justice we own,"
"The wounds we suffer,"
"The affinity won't heed to us,"
"Oft,the ardor tunes a lullaby,"
"Oft,the ardor beheads us "
"Known we'll be burnt as fire,
we become wood."
"To unify the relationship."
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"
"An affinity born like a thread
from banana fibre!"
Welcome...
Elayarani is not seen.
What do you say?
What are you blabbering? I searched all over.
Did you checked well?
Yes.
Mom, i'll check it.
Nothing will be wrong.
Wait, i'll check.
You go and see.
Who's evil eyes bestowed on our family?
All the ill things happens only to us!
Be quite.
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.
What to do?
Call her.
Her phone is switched off.
No...
Don't know what to do?
What happened?
I searched everywhere.
She is not anywhere.
No...
No...
What I'll do?
Don't know where she is!
What happened brother-in-law?
She is not here.
Is she not here?
Is she eloped?
She made us to be ashame.
Is she eloped?
Why do you talk ill?
Then how to talk?
Please.
Stop it uncle.
Did I intended for this relationship?
It's you asked for.
Children don't understand
the desire of parents.
I came to your house
neglecting my father's words.
For that your whole family cheated me
Did I struggled all the way
to divide the families?
Nothing is going to happen hereafter.
That's not son-in-law.
You say it easily.
Instead of making us to be
ashame each and every time,
It's better you would've
slapped us with waders.
Why do you talk so harsh?
The relationship comes only once in life.
We stand here for it.
I don't want this compromises.
Not as compromise,
it's a fact that
both families wish to unify.
For that,both of you have must brought
up your daughters disciplined.
We don't have any rights to talk to you,
Though you are younger,
i apologise on behalf of my children.
What are you doing?
Why do you fall on his feet?
I'll do this marriage.
It's my responsibility to do this marriage.
She made us to bend down.
Hey,Mathi...
Where is she?
What?
Hey.
What?
Where is Elayarani?
I don't know dad.
Tell me.
I don't know dad.
Where did you hid her?
I promise,I don't know dad.
Why do you ask him brother?
I can't hide anything.
Ask him.
Dad!
What's this?
What's happening here?
What's happening here?
It's true that we both loved each other.
What do you say?
But I promise, I don't know where is she now.
No...
How many times you makes us ashame?
Where is my sister?
Mathi...
No...
Where is she?
Really I don't know.
Tell now
They are asking.
Tell them.
Don't hit him.
Where is she?
Tell now.
He mustn't have done any fault.
No...
Tell now.
Tell them not to hit him.
Brother-in-law,ask where his brother now?
His brother knows where is the bride?
Past, he abducted the bride
for the sake of his brother.
Don't hurt my brother.
Today, his brother might did the same.
Tell me, where is your brother?
They are hitting our son, no one is bothered.
Please ask them not to hit.
I don't know.
I promise on my dad.
Believe me.
Mathi...
Listen here.
Hey, who are you?
When he promise on his dad,
a person meant solely everything to us.
Then it's true that he doesn't know.
It'll be known now about your brother!
Selvarani,
I don't know uncle.
Don't hurt my sister-in-law.
Tell me, Elayarani,
Selvarani,where is your husband?
Hello Elayarani,where are you?
Aunt, she is in our home.
What is she doing in home?
Didn't I tell you?
Do you know what you did?
You be there, we'll come now.
What to do now?
Brother,she is in home.
Everything went wrong.
Don't know why does she do it?
Why does she do it?
You would've asked me in person dad.
To keep up your word on this marriage,
I fell on others feet.
Mathi...
Mathi...
I'm leaving dad.
Mathi...
I hurt without my conscience.
Don't tell that dad.
I'll cry my heart out.
Sister-in-law!
What the hell you did?
You made the whole family to be ashamed.
I thought atleast one of my sister
will be light of life,
but both are charcoal.
Brother!
Mom,forgive me.
Dad,forgive me.
Is it forgivable?
It's my fault.
A fault,I did unknowingly.
Instead of suffering in other's house,
it's good to stay back in our house
with his rememberance.
You would've told us afore.
I made my mind hard,
to fulfill your wish of unifying the families.
I can't be as strong as Mathi.
That's why I left.
It's not only him,
I don't want this marriage.
I'll stay in our home.
You stay here itself.
Brother,I'm not saying it to fulfill my love.
I promise on our whole family,
I'll be as your sister throughout my life.
Did she eloped like her elder sister?
Yes,
Ponder a little,
when she is bold enough to
go to home from here,
Can't she elope?
We unified with our elder one,
who deserted us.
Why we must hurt her
when she wish to be with us?
Yes.
Elayarani, don't cry to me.
Ask dad whatever it is.
What do you say?
Past,I spoke to you on frustration.
How long my life span will be?
Dad!
Yes.
Yes,you must take care of both
the girls from my stance after me.
Dad,why do you go emotional?
Brother,
In-laws,
In-law,
Oft, youngsters behave matured,
We the elders become immature.
That's what happened now.
Before we came here,
 I know what would've happened.
In-law,
Shall I ask you a favour?
Will you agree my son
to marry your daughter?
What's this?
If you haven't asked,
we must have come to you.
Sister,
I know what do you  think about?
You are more than my own brother.
We are happy to send our
younger daughter to your home.
Come on.
Brother!
Go.
Be happy.
I don't know about your relationships.
When she came to our home for the function,
I wish she must marry our son Mathi.
It happened so.
So happy.
Bro,
I'm so happy uncle.
Hello.
Hello, is it Govindaraj mudaliyar?
Yes.
I'm Kannan speaking from pesticides shop.
What's the stuff?
Is your elder son, Arivazhagan?
Yes.
Then your younger son is Mathiazhagan?
Yes.
Mathi bought all the pesticide content
from my shop and left in hurry.
What do you say?
It seems he'll gorge the whole and die.
What do you say?
One more important stuff.
Elder son is yet to remit the
amount for the content he bought.
Your younger son also bought in debt.
Either give me the money
or the contents of my shop.
Hey!
Hello.
Hello.
Hanged up.
Others gorge poison unbearable
of the  mounted debts.
But both of these guys
made debt to gorge poison.
Don't know what family is it!
Mathi, please stop.
Listen to us.
Mathi...
Listen to us.
I won't listen.
I don't want anyone.
I'll do whatever I wish.
Mathi! Mathi!
Yes, you did all the mistakes
and plead him now.
Tell them clearly.
What happened now?
Is it a fault if both the brothers love
the girls of the same household?
Do you know a gossip?
What's it?
I alone marry both the sisters.
Next week is my marriage
with my wife's sister.
My wife distributes the invitations to all.
Not even a single invitation
will be given to you.
It's the fact.
Shut up.
Be good.
But don't be the best.
Mathi,
Uncle is pleading,stop.
He doesn't listen to his dad itself.
Don't stop.
Mathi...
Welcome dude,
Hey,
We can discuss it later.
We can identify you,turn on.
Brother-in-law,
Why is he here?
As you don't have the responsibility,
So I arranged his marriage.
Oh,it's your work.
Leave now.
Respectfully I said in telugu.
Hey,
Mathi.
Hey,who is she?
She is new,you go now.
Will talk to you later.
Mathi!Mathi!
Hey mathi, what's all this?
Who is getting married?
See, it's a temple.
People will come and go.
Pray god,take prasadam and leave.
Hey, he is your dad.
Even if he asks the prasadam
is available in hot.
Hey,
What happens here now?
A marriage is going to  happen here.
Marriage?
If you wish,stay back.
if not you leave.
Call the bride.
Uncle, get the bride soon.
You are doing too proud.
Mathi, what's this?
No..
Mathi...
What is it?
Son-in-law!
Hello, who are you?
Aunt!
To whom?
No...
Son-in-law!
Mr.Rajangam sir,
What you mean, sir?
Or else madam?
I also do comedy.
Dude, we have taken a good decision.
Don't be in hurry.
Yes.
I also took a good decision.
You all watch it.
What?  Listen to him.
Listen to me first.
Do you know to chant mantras?
Call Elayarani.
Phone rings.
Hello,
Just now called! she comes suddenly!
What?
Nothing.
Heard some noise outside.
Doing entertainment.
Flowers, designs etc...
Arrangements are amazing!
To whom is the marriage?
It's to my kin.
To me?
Yes, to you.
To me?
I promise.
The marriage is to you.
Believe me.
Come.
Go... Go...
Yes, how many times his
marriage gets disrupted?
I feel pity for him.
In the first marriage,
 I abducted the bride for my brother's sake.
In the next marriage,
 she rejected him.
So,I arranged this marriage with
Mandiramoorthy's daughter.
He is pityful.
Dude is blabbering,
Can't you help him?
Yes,I'll proceed...
When we mention his name not only bride
even banquet hall is not available.
Don't cry.
I'll also be sentimental.
Dude, do you like the bride?
If not also she is only bride.
Sit down, tie the mangal sutra.
He panicked us in few minutes.
Shower ur blessings.
Bang the drums!
Are you in love with anyone?
I.....
It's okay,even if so...
(Chanting Mantras)
Why are you in hurry?
I didn't love anyone.
God!
I'm yet to chant the mantras.
He'll listen in Whatsapp
(Chanting Mantras)
Greetings!
What's the stuff?
My brother has fallen in love.
I know.
But it's not accepted in house.
I know.
He shouldn't gorge poison like me,
so I'm buying the poison contents
from all the shops.
No...
Mathi...
Nothing happened to you, isn't it?
Is it?
You said a life will be lost,
whose life is that?
It's mine.
Why?
Mathi told me to say so.
He told me to postpone
the marriage for a year,
so that he'll get rid of the problems.
Why are you here?
Anyone can come to temple,durai.
But you shouldn't come.
Why?
I came after knowing the history.
You know the history?
Tell now to the public.
Who built Tajmahal?
Bharathiraja...
That's the film directed by him.
Why not we slap him?
