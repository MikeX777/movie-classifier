He has corns on his sole..

He is the masseurforthe prisoners here..
If you have any breaks
or sprains in your body..
He would massage
and set them right is what he meant..
Massaging is all fine..
Ages back he while massaging on someone,
His hands slipped and landed
right at the jugular..
That guy's life ended there itself..
Now he is going through
this hell forthat accident..
Hey Kottaram... you have got your hearing

Supervisor, me and today's judge
do not have a great relationship..
Even if I go to the court or not..
Let me tell you my fate..
I will be inside..
Should I go today?
Get lost...
Sir, whichever house he breaks into..
Only when the time is 12 midnight
will he start stealing.
Hey..Corny..
Everyjob has its schedule of working..
OthenNise will need to be in jail like you..
My Sir...thus in one house
he waited for 12 midnight to strike..
Where he waited was beneath the car..
He dozed of there..
So what if I dozed off..
Morning itself the landlord shook me awake..
And said, "lets go"..
I said, "fine"
He brought me right here..
Only later did I come to know..
He was a Magistrate..
That was just great...
Without wandering around the court premises,
he could reach his wife's home.
Cooo...
Waste of time...

Yes..Sure..
Why are you crying?
To see my brother likethis...

A useless person's coming is of no use too..
Every time you come I say this same thing..
Do you get to see my son?
Would it be possible to get him along here?
Not possible I know..
How is brotherAbdul?
Pretty long time since I saw him.
Unable to walk..
Yet keeps talking about coming here..
His not coming leaves me
without any local news..
Dear brother, have you ever hated me?

A good part of life...
Inside this..
Having lost everything
When I think...
Feel I will lose my stability
Don't you have any job?
These are fate, dear..
If you are going to stand and cry like this..
Don't come..
I don't like all this crying and emotions..
Supervisor...
Time...
lam not worrying you, brother..
lam leaving..
What is it?
In reality who is this Alex supervisor?
Who is he?
From Pala when I reached Adivaram
with my father Pullakunnel Philipose
lwas all offourteen...
What is it? What happened?
- Got beaten..
- Why...
That MattukattaSadashivan
Because I asked the wages
for having worked on his land
He hit me in front of his
house like beating a dog
We can't allow that guy free any longer..
Anything needs to be done immediately..
Take him to the hospital immediately
Come"
Those days the entire Adivaram
was under Mattukatta Sadhashivam
till our last breath.."
Don't be afraid..Come..
For our parents we are four children..
lam the youngest..
Red Salute!
Red Salute!
Like our Jesus Christ that person
is someone who sacrificed himself forthe poor.
Here also there are many poor people
When a filth Mattakata Sadhasivan
controls the Valley,
Our poor Christ alone ain't enough
Dynamic Krishna Pillai is needed
Blood for Blood must fall!
This when I hold in my hand,
Not sure how...
but like a phython crawling.
Courages crawls in
Not Mattukattai...
Give a damn to any bigwig then!
Hey, stand there
Come
Dad, Elephant!
If not Elephant, will your forefathers
come to the woods then?
Hold this
Dip it
Dip I say
Dad!
Come
Come here if dare!
Don't expect you can graze here!
Come if you dare
(laughing)
Don'ttry to frighten us!
lwill burn you down
Get away
Say boldly!
Any rogue elephants can come if dare!
G o away.
Get away
Get away
Get away
Hold it
No Elephant can stand against a
man's defiance!
This strength you musterfrom the jungle
Until you have it, no one can defeat you!
How long are we
going to live in fear of those rogues?
Don't we need a change in this?
So we should stand together
Those words provided me the confidence
Dad was becoming an entire village's
inspiration
Against Mattukatta Sadashivam
who was doing injustice towards labourers
my dad united the workers!
Under dad's leadership,
a flagstaff arose there
That was the workers' organisation's first red
flag
bearing flagstaff in Adivaram!
Hey, Your bloody communism!!
This is Mattukatta Sadasivan's territory
This place does not need your party or flag
Take it and get lost
Hell with him!
Remove all
Hey you!
No one makes a move!
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Communist party zindabad
Communist party zindabad
Let the flag fly
Let the flag fly
Let the red flag fly
Let the red flag fly
This flag will fly here..
lfdare touch it, you...
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Him?
Yes him only.
Hey move.
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
I will finish you right today
Who the hell are you to hoistthe flag here?
Your bloody com munism!
Long live revolution
Revolution hasjust begun, sir!
-You..
-Sir!
If we hold them longer,
villagers will burn us down!
Long live revolution
Police, serve justice!
Send them away
Release Comrade Philipose!
Release Comrade Philipose
Police, serve justice
Dad!
For every drop of blood revenge we shall seek
Police Atrocity, down down
Police Atrocity, down down
Running from amidst protesters
holding my dad and crying
the Kathrina being my little sister
I learntjust that day
ldidn't ask dad anything
In front of hertears,
I had no questions
Long live Comrade Philipose
Long live Comrade Philipose
MPl Long live
Dear Comrades!
In this hill-farmers' sweat soaked
soil ofAdivaram...
The first person to hoist a red flag here,
was Comrade Philipose with his brave hands!!
Our dearest Comrade Philipose,
being elected as our Local Committee Secretary
is being announced with immense happiness
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Long live revolution
Go over there and play dear
lf mom comes to know about her...
Before knowing the truth about Kathrina,
Mom left us
Followed by Dad
"Death will come once"
"Bearin mind you mortals"
"Go along with you"
"all actions in your life"
"Do good deeds without being lazy"
"Death will come once"
"Bearin mind you mortals"
"Go along with you"
"all actions in your life"
"Do good deeds without being lazy"
Body is being taken to the church
Is there anyone left to see the body?
Yes, there is!
Kathrina!
Go..
Dad!
Dear come
Don't cry, come.
Brother, our dad..
Are you sending her away,
Or you want us to leave?
She neither has a dad nor mom
Leaving her on the roads,
will not be forgiven by the Lord
What about the deceit dad did to mom?
Is that forgivable one?
Don't forgive
Supporting a wrong
is a greater wrong than the wrong done
What do you want me to do now?
Leave it, brother! I will go away
Don't quarrel amongst you because of me.
You keep quiet
To have all of you reach this far..
land dad toiled hard in the forests ofAdivaram,
not for one or two years
But for 16 long years!!
Because we spent days and nights
without food and sleep and built all these,
that had you all get these nice
people as husbands!
One more thing
This house was built with my sweat too
Who stays or leaves, I decide!
Alex, then do one thing, give our share
Brother-in-law's share was
given at her marriage itself
75 Soverigns!
Similar 75 and 100 Sovereigns...
All of you have got.
If more is wanted, I will give you
Here.. the will father wrote
before his death!
Enough for three of you!
Take
And this is my share..
This also three of you divide and eat.
And I'm taking her
Dad's blood, isn't she?
I own little land there..
We will live there.
Get in, dear..Go.
Why are you worrying?
Dad is also no more.
Who else do l have now?
Then who am
?
Now on, I'm your dad and mom, understood?
Don't worry
Okay
Look at m e.
This brother is with you, got it?
(Fight)
Only Pullakunnel Philipose is dead
His son is still alive
My dad hoisted this flag
lf dare touch this flag
I will hoist another flag
smeared with your blood!
You keep yourflag and I will keep myflag
That's enough

Praise the Lord, father
Yes Alex, started harvesting Pineapples?
Yeah Father..it's the first crop..
So let this be forthe Church
That is great..Come
Why giving it to the Church?
Offering I guess!
As far as I know,
Philipose chettan even to take shelter from rain
hasn't stepped into the church
Even though he didn't want the Lord,
He was a gentleman of goodness and love!
What is the noise there, Father?
It's a final rehearsal
- Margam Kali(Christian Dance)
- Oh
Church festival must rockthis time!
See you then
(Christian Traditional dance)
What is all this? Dance-drama?
No, Isn't this Kuchipudi?
Shut up you. This is Bhartanatyam
-
t's not Bharatnatyam
- Then?
No..?
This is Margam Kali(Christian Dance)
If so, then give a different name for it
Didn't like it?
Her brothers look like wild buffaloes
She is their only sister
Be careful
Comrade, what is that girl's name?
Why the hell you wish to know? Shut up
Drinktoddy
Girl's name..

Annie!
Yes!
- Sister-in-law! Is the tapioca done?

When you go to the market, give this also
No l can't...the moment I see that flirt,
You don't flirt at him
Keep quiet, bro!
Would not even sell for buying fodder!
Give that vessel quickly
Where is the Vessel?

Only this much?
Look, this is what is for 5 litres?

Then do it.
Move aside
Come on, pour
Pour..
After toiling the whole day in the fields
and amongst cattles,we get this
Don't get the money's worth!
And also need to listen to his cheap comments!
You call yourselfa big leader of
Agricultural Society
You know how the poor like us strugge to live?
Calls himself a comrade!!
Has got a small dent
Straightening will do!
Get it fixed!
After this incident,
Agricultural society took a decision
collect crops directly from
the farmers and give its price
"We heard the harvest song,
the fragrance of the soil when
the crops are reaped has come"
"Singing the harvest song loudly,
Workers have come to reap the yield"
"Along with the song
which you sing tactfully and tunefully,
O breeze, come dancing and singing"
"In the joy of celebration,
In the chariot of happiness"
"Everyone join together,
humming the tune of some song"
"We heard the harvest song,
the fragrance of the soil
when the crops are reaped has come,
"Singing the harvest song loudly,
workers have come to reap the yield"
"We heard the harvest song,
the fragrance of the soil
when the crops are reaped has come"
"O sprightly girl, come
Give me one measure ofthe yield"

For doing a good deed,

- You can't catch me
- Stop..Stop

lam telling you..Stop
-Where was he running to?
- I don't know..
Police and Army all are behind him
What is the issue..
Police and Army are here..
Weren't you aware of it?
How will I know?
He visits once in a year during holidays
That Varghese is no.1 fraud!
Toddy, Ganja, Women..
As it's a Church, I'm not saying anything more.
He..the other day..
Ouch my leg.
Assaulted a Major ofthe Army!
It is forthe Court Martial,
they have come to arrest him
Court Master!! Who is that?
Who is this silly guy! Like Police
Even Army has a law and Court
Except one difference
Ourthrashings go a bit soft
And in theirs that would be missing!
If they land their hands on him..
What shall we do now, Alex?
What to do, lkka?
Because of that rascal,
my children's rituals have become a mess!
Don't worry
I'll go and enquire
Katherina..Dear Katherina
Slept off?
Hasn't she returned home?
Katherina, your colonel has come..
- Thanks bro-in-law!
- For what?
I should have got this little earlier
Listen...Don't..make a fool of me..
lam saying this on my heart..
Do you know, it was after offering of
golden crucifix to Malayatoor Church,
- l was born..
- That I understood now..
You are the one crucifying us!!
Everyone love, pampered and spoilt me!
I've never known hardship in my lifetime
Ask her if you want
l have given a lot of worries, dear?
Please forgive me
Sister-in-law, you also know that it
bro-in-law alone who looks after all of us
Do you think I would have done all that?
Are you asking that to me
Got to ask!
Got have asked that, bro-in-law!
Should have scolded me! I swear
No one corrected me
Never tried to mend me either!
At least now beat me, bro-in-law!
Let me reform
Ask him to hit me
Not hitting me?
Army..
Please don't have me over
lt's Court Martial!
Look at the way they come
lf get me, they will hammer me..
lsn't you who said getting
beaten would mend you?
They will thrash nicely
And you can also reform
Please bro-in-law!
I will go somewhere and survive
- Where to?
- Canada...
Canada!! Forget Canada,
they will not let you cross this Kaloopara,
Without serving the punishment!
Could I see my daughter?
She slept
Rascal! Are you coming out
or shall we come in?
- We knew that you will be in here
Come out-Go..
Aren't they calling to reform you
Pull him out
For long he has been making us run around..
Take him..
- Dear!- Hubby!
Sir, release him only after he reformed
Move..rascal Walk..
You don't worry.
Could be only for one or two years..
Later they will set him free.
Let him come back after serving punishment
Whetherto Canada or America,
I will send him wherever he wishes to!
Good if he changes to better!
Come
Oh! Katrina! Look who is coming!
- Lost yourjob, is it?
- Yes
Then why walk around in that Uniform?
Still my desire is not fulfilled!
That's why didn't remove it
Tea!
Get in
Drink tea!
Let the weariness of the war disappear!
Ain't sweet!
Milk too would've been fine
Ain't sweet. Milk would've be fine
What next?
No plans
Drink tea and survive, is it?
Want to survive
To send Varappan to Canada,
why mortgage this house and property?
Katrina also owns 3 acres of land, isn't it?
Can't you mortgage that?
Katrina did tell me that
Let's not pledge that
Don't you know Varappan's nature?
If he doesn't repay the loan,
My sister and child will be on the streets
You also have a wife and child
Don't get angry
ljust told you the fact
Carry it carefully

You please go away
When I asked a loan for my son,
What did he say?
That's why I asked you to go
Here he comes!
Stop..Stop the Jeep
When asked money for
my son's college admission,
What did you say?
Then there is no rule for that.
Now when your brother-in-law
was caught in ganja case,
To get him off you utilised Society funds..
Don't stare
Your brother-in-law himself conveyed this to
me
Comrades walking around to cheat people!!
Get away
Comrades working for country's welfare!!
-Are you not getting down
- No
You paid the loan?
Hmm..Yes
Where did you pay?
In the Bank or Forest Office?
Learnt to tell lies also, haven't you?
What else do I do? Isn't she my sibling?
Sibling!!
Always it is about your
sister and herfamily!!
You love your sister..He
p her..
ldidn't stop you, did I?
This is not Love but Madness!!
Complete Madness!
Despair and hardship are not
only for your Sister
Even others have!
When she is in danger,
What should I do you say?
What danger!
Did they meet with any accident?
Or got hospitalised for any illness?
The person smuggling ganja
with family beside him..
Before even having him in the family
you should have given a thought.
Even otherwise here...
What is the point of talking that again?
I made a mistake
No, It's me who made a mistake
Despite knowing my illness, you gave me life,
I started loving you immensely.
l obeyed whatever you said
Now I understood
It's not for love you married this sick woman
Annie, don't talk crap
Words once spoken cannot be retrieved
What's wrong if I talk?
You took advantage of my illness
My family life and child is
your beneficence towards me!
And you can live as you please
You also know I will live like
a slave irrespective of what you do
Isn't that why you gave the
entire property to your sister?
And the house and fields, you pledged at
bank for saving your brother-in-law
Whenever anyone comes asking for help,
You have given whatever you had to people!
What have you given to yourwife and child?
Tell me
Only this sacred thread is left on me
You want this also?
Take it
Otherthan walking around as a Comrade,
trying to find out about people's concerns
Have you everfound out whether
I have clothes to change and wear?
Your loving son's school fees
is yet to be paid
Please be patient
Give me some more time..
lwill bring everything in order..
Time?
Isn't it 8 -10 yrs now?
Isn't that time enough?
Now everything is over!
We can move on to the road..
And beg
Will you stop it?
lf sister alone was enough,
then why marry me?
Can't you hug and sleep with her?
How dare you..
Talking nonsense..
Been controlling myself...
Even othenNise I'm standing on fire..
Amidst that..
Uncle
Uncle
- Uncle
-Yes son..
What
What happened?
Dad..Dad..
Tell the matter
Dad killed mom
Eh!
Lisie, Annie is in trouble
Where, son?
Overthere
Hey you..
-Why did you..
- You killed her, is it?
You killed our sister, is it?
You rascal, you killed her, is it?
Vargheeachha...Our loving sister
See whatAlex has done!
Somebody lift him up
Supervisor, what happened?
Why are you covering your ears?
When my son shouted that Dad killed Mom,
My heart was broken
All my relations are broken after
my Annie is gone.
One by one was broken like that.
It is said that all relationships are bindings.
It is better not to have any relations.
Now lfeel better.
Here I am only locked with this key
Supervisor!
Sir!
- I came with glad news forAlex.
- What is it, Sir?
Supervisor, your parole is sanctioned.
You should be having
good hold with higher officials.
I don't have any hold with them.
Is it true?
The order has come. You can leave tomorrow.
Krishnan Nair! My parole has been sanctioned!
Supervisor, you should offer
a coconut to Lord Ganapati in here.
I had vowed for that.
Of course, I will
Dude Aravind!
My parole has been sanctioned!
Monis! Hey Kottaram! Hey Aani!
My parole has been sanctioned!
So, you can leave tomorrow!
Sir, is ittrue? Not to trick me, right?
lam very happy, Sir
It was good thatAlex's Police report
was favourable
Supervisorâ€™s credibility and good behaviour,
along with that our support helped for it too.
Vinod! l have signed all the files.
Please release him fast finishing
all the proceedings.
Sir, l have sent his wage details
to the accounts.
Tell them to approve it fast,
and transfer the money to Alex's account ok?
Hey Supervisor, I heard the news.
- You are going out on parole today, aren't you?
- Yes.
Dude Kili! Give his civil to him, C101
101?
Yes. Please sign here.
- Supervisor!
- Yes
Don't try to return immediately.
Won't the police men look for me?
There is an idea for that.
After you reach home,
call the Jailor and tell him
that you have resigned.
How long you have been living here.
It is enough.
Anyway, for whom are you saving
all this money?
Sir, has he not recovered yet?
Only sometimes he feels
like missing something.
After some time, he becomes normal.
Now, he is missing something, am I right?
Not only me, you too Sir.
What should I bring for you
when I come back?
Can you bring a mobile phone
with good range?
I did a mistake by asking you.
Don't waste your time talking to him.
You go.
Ok then.
Give that to me!
Good man! But went out on parole.

l was also very happy like this,
when I went out on parole for the first time
But they had to call the army
to bring me back.
What a fantastic memory!
You should not do like that,
you should come back, ok?
Sure, I will come back.
Please visit my house when you have time.
And please see my daughter.
lwill do that. lwill go to
his house also.
I need to visit his parents
and also the girl who has been
waiting for him. Ok then
Supervisor, I don't have
any one to enquire about me.
Once a person is injail,
not even his relatives like him.

That's enough for me.
Ok then
Ok, Ok
Sir,
Alex, the whole Central jail
is celebrating your parole.
This is thefirst time a person,
is sent on parole with music and dance.
You are happy, aren't you?
Sir, thank you for all the help
you have done for me.
We, officers are always
good friends to loyal prisoners.
Don't waste time, you can leave.
I will take leave then.
Sir!
I am on parole
Alex, no need to tell you.
Come back on time.
I will surely reach, Sir.
When you come back,
- then also you should look happy like this.
- I know.
Or we will be in trouble.
Sir, lam leaving.
Sir, shall I deductAlex from the Count?
Yes sir, okay sir
Alex! One minute.
Superintendent is calling you.
Go quickly
Sir, you called me as when
everything was done
and ljust stepped out ofthejail
Alex, I called you..
Sir, whatever you ask me to,
I will leave only after I finish the job.
To polish your shoes, iron the shirts
or to arrange the files, whatever you say.
Is there any work in the quarters?
Not that Alex.
Then what?
I received the FAX message
cancelling your parole.
On certain occasions,
parole can get cancelled naturally.
lfthere is a threat to the person
who is released on parole
Or if that person is a threat to someone else,
In that case, parole can get cancelled.
In this case, your son did it.
Is it true?
Could it be that someone else
used his signature for that?
That can't happen, right?
Policemen won't do anything against me.
Then, lam going back to the cell.
l have to give these clothes back.
He is the one, isn't he?
Sir, It's sad.
This is the saddest incident in my service.
ls his son that much troublesome?
May be.
What can we do when there is a report
that he is a threat to his son.
Supervisor!
Did you come back so quickly after parole?
What a show off you did!
Dance and songs, isn't it dude?
Did you bring any beedi?
Please share one with me if you have.
Why are you looking at?
Sir!
Have you send request to camp?
Yes Sir!
Please do the formalities immediately.
- Don't make it late.
- Ok Sir!
Alex!
Sir, why did you call me?
Who is this Abdu?
He is a friend in my village
He has sent a message here.
l enquired about it,
And confirmed it a while ago.
Don't worry.
Your sister Katrina passed away this morning.
Abdu said the burial
will be happening today itself.
Please write an application for escort parole,
Then you go and see your sister.
Hello, yes, sir,
Ok,
I don't think we can get anyone
from cam p tomorrow for escort duty.
It is because of the President's visit.
Alex! Then we cannot do anything
but cancel the escort parole.
Then, I can't see my Katrina, isn't it, Sir?
You can't take me near her, can you?
lam not even allowed to
put a handful of sand on her coffin.
(Prayer in Arabic)
- How are you?
- I am good.
- What's up?
- Fine Sir.
Are you still carrying on with your old things?
Who are you? I didn't recognise you?
Doctor, please reduce his medicine dose.
Tell me,Alex.
Sir, my sister.
I heard about it.
The prisoners' worries are ours also to some
extent.
Wearing this uniform, I too am not able to do
anything beyond a limit
I want to help you, Alex.
Sir,
Can we putAlex name
once again in parole board?
Let us see
if it is passed by the Advisory board.
Ok, let us see.
Will it work? Last time it didn't work.
It will, be positive
Request once again for the police report!
Get one more application from Alex.
Ok Sir,
Everything will be fine.
Report has come
Oh, Alex's police report is favourable.
Supervisor, don't have to say good bye today.
You can leave.
Four people to court, five to Medical college,
and me too
- Please reduce 10 people from your count.
- Ok.
Tomorrow there is case for Aani and lsalman,
Please don't forget about it.
I will take of that.
Ok then
Sir!
Sign over here, Alex
Isn't there any music or dance this time?
No Sir.
Don't forget about the date
you need to come back.
10th of next month, before 5pm
Also, be careful
not to get involved in any case.
I will take leave.
Sir, lam Alex. I came out ofjail on parole.
I came here to sign.
That old valley case!
Go inside and see Sl sir.
You can sign after that
Ok, I will call
Alex.
Good behaviour in jail,
should be seen here as well.
- Its only for 15 days you know?
- I know Sir.
Don't create any issue,
with any person related to your case.
Then you can sign and leave.
Alex.
Why didn't you let me know
that you are coming?
Isn't this better?
Haseena, see who's here?
-Come.
- I am coming.
Come inside.
Did you recognise him?
No
He is our Alex
He always talks about you.
Come and sit, sit
Sit here.
You both talk, I will make some tea.
She is a distant relative of mine.
My relatives fixed the marriage
and thus it happened.
Dear, come here.
Do you know her?
Of course. She looks just like Katrina.
What class are you studying?
Grade11
After Katrina died,
Varghese has become an alcoholic.
He is brewing at home itself.
Policemen come there often.
As agirl,
I thought it was not proper
for her to stay there.
I brought her here.
Katrina might have died
worrying about his deeds.
Does he come here?
He visits sometimes, to see her.
Tea
Dear, come
This is all her works.
We celebrate Christmas for her.
Oh, the comrades are here.
Comrade, just came to know at the junction.
Then, we closed the shop and came.
After my legs got injured,
they handle the business.
How is your leg now?
It hurts badly when I walk
Then, I will take leave.
I need to take bath.
Then need to go and see my son.
l have only 15 days in hand.
Where are you going? Stay here.
In that case, shall we have a Party.
These guys are just waiting
for a chance to drink.
Then we will have brandy.
Its been 8 years since I saw
the sky and stars without a barrier.
Not even in my dreams
that l everthought about seeing
you guys again.
Forget about that, comrade.
Here, take it.
No dude, I got to see my son.
lfl go there drunk,
he will ask whether
he brought me outside for this?
Why don't you tell him that,
it's because of the happiness
about seeing him?
- Drink! Here!
- No No
Drink!
No no.
Didn't you hear Abdukka saying not to drink?
If they will throw you out ofjail for drinking,
let them.
Okthen, bring it here
May
 drink?
I want to see my son.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
He must be waiting for me.
Hey Alex, don't go to see him drunk.
I shall tell him about it.
That his dad got drunk
feeling happy about seeing him.
He will bear it.
If any of you want tojoin me,
then come
Or I will go alone.
There are so many people over there.
-Alex! Dude! Alex!
- What?
Its very noisy there. Don't go now.
What if I go?
Don't fightwith him now.
Come! Let's go.
Get into the car. Come! Let's go.
It seems Alex has come!
- Where?
- Over there.
Please hold the child
What's it, dear?
- Come
- Where?
Over there.
- Did you see?
- Yes.
- No one's here
-

Is it true?
Is he alone?
They are all with him.
- Maybe you just felt like that.
- Not that.

Kill him!
lfl draw a line, you will be finished.
Have come to take revenge
after waiting for 5-8 years!
Get lost!
l have come on parole for 15 days,
to see my son.
If you stand on my way,
I will forget
that you are Annie's brothers.
Here they have come with a knife,
to shave.
lshould have bundled you up
in a corner and kick.
Just because the jailor said that
you were well behaved in jail,
lam letting you to go.

till your parole period is finished,
Sir, its not me.
They hit me at the cemetery..
Stop it
Don't takethe pain of explaining more.
Once again if I get to see you here...
Get lost!
Did you really have to do that?
I told you then itself.
They are all finding ways to trap you.
To whom are you showing your discomfiture?
Its been 8 years since I met my son.
He got me out on parole.
It's already 2 days I am here
When I ask you about my son,
you guys arejust fooling me.
Why are you hiding from me?
I know what to do.

Dude Pass!
Sir, can I see the children

They have gone to hostel after the match.
They will stay in hostel

Ready boys!

Do you know when they will be back?
Don't know that.
Let's go.

Come inside, it is very cold here.
Dear, tell mother to make tea for us.

CCTV visuals with the help of cyber police.
The security who has been attacked,
is in a critical condition.
The district police head said that

How fast is the kid running?
He escaped this time as well.
What is this Sir? What happened?
He is a student ofthis school.
Selling cannabis is his main job.
Very difficult to catch..
Otherwise we would have handed
him overto police long time back.
What to do?
His father wenttojail killing his mother.
Hmm..Children get spoiled even
when parents take care of them well.
Then how can an orphan?
How was your trip? Did you see him?
Was it him?
Let's not think about it anymore.
That's why I asked you not
to go there to meet him.
Will this parole go waste?
Abdukka, turn on the TV please.
You turn on the TV.
Attack on ATM. CCTV visuals are out.
Security guard who was attacked has died.
Visuals of the accused are now available.
Police has said that the accused
is a convict who is in parole.
DGP said a new investigation team has been
set up to further investigate this case.
What am I seeing?
Whose is this?
This..
Take care ofthe mobile phone.
I will tell you more once I get back.
Are you out in parole to kill and loot?
Isn't it? Come.
I had already warned you.
You should not have appeared in front of me.
Get in.
Abdukka.
- Sir..
- What happened?
He is in custody. lwill take him there soon.
Hmm..OK.
What is happening? I can't understand
anything, my god.
- Is he inside?
- Yes.
Put your hands down.
Alex, CCTV visuals are against you.
Do you have anything to say?
I didn't do it.
Then who?
Two guys on bike.
How do you know that?
I saw it.
What did you see?
Two guys on bike attacking the security guard.
Can you recognise that bike or those two
guys?
What man? Are you about to lie?
- No, sir.
- Then what?
You said you saw their faces

Yes,just got aglimpse.
Just a glimpse? Can you recognise them?
You should recognise them.
Call the witness.
Get inside

to the hospital,
who was attacked by this man?
Yes, we took him to the hospital. But..
Yes, speak up.
We didn't see him attacking.
But he was there.
Hmm. Do you know him from before?
No sir, seeing forthe first time.
Why did you come that way?
If we go that way,
we can reach temple two and a half hours
earlier.
That's why.
OK. You can go now.
We will call you if needed.
- Yes, sir.
- Ok. Go now.
God save us.
Alex, because you are a convict out in parole,
We had doubt seeing you in CCTV visuals.
We couldn't take the death statement
of the security guard.
Visuals of a motor bike passing
through there has been received.
Same bike has also been found in
CCTV visuals of nearby petrol pump.
If we can find who there are,
you can be safe for the time being.
OK. You can go now.
We will call you if needed.
Alex, after you were taken away by police,
so many calls came in to this phone.
I didn't pick up.
But, I want to know some otherthing now.
You didn't say anything about it.
Hit him!
Save me.
Break his head.
Leave him..
Who are you?
Let's go..Get in to the vehicle.
Get up. Get up.
Stop the vehicle, stop please.
Someone attacked him, take him to
the hospital please.
What happened?
Someone hit him. Please help.
My ribs are broken
Oh my God!
Don't worry. They are pilgrims.
They will take you.
Start the Car
Oh god!
Out of thetwo people on bike,
one was Shine, my son.
My god! What are you saying?

Why are you not picking the call?
lam tired of calling.
I did all this believing you.
After doing everything,
now you are not taking my call.
You saw the news, rig ht?
lam very much tensed.
lam going to tell everything to Dad.
You just see, you will be trapped.
Our last hope is this mobile phone.
Anyways, it is in our hand now.
The police will find the bike
tracing the CCTV visuals.
Before that we have to identify the caller.
Or my son will be jailed for murder.
My God. That should not happen.
Somehow, we need to save him.
Maybe it's her decision, Annie's.
Otherwise, how could this mobile phone
reach your hands?
l have only 10 more days left.
I need to find my son within that time.
What is it, Varghese?
I came to pick my daughter.
I can't let her live
in this house with prisoners.
Here also there is a well.
Wells are his weakness.
She is the only one left for me now.
Varghese, if you came to meet
your daughter, meet her and leave!
Dead
Pappa!
Dear, did you hear about your uncle's news?
He killed that security guard
soon after getting out ofjail.
He will go back soon.
It is not safe to stay here now.
You start quickly. Let's go.
Uncle will not kill anyone.
The Police have got all the evidences.
They will charge him with
all those, you know?
I don't know who are going
to be hit by him.
Anyways, you start quickly, let us go.
lam not coming anywhere.
Aren't you hungry?
If you want something,
come inside and wait.
I will cook something for you.
Then fry to eggs for me.
Or bullseye is also fine.
The people and politicians of Kottamam
are all agitated now.
The Police is after the bike in the CCTV.
Note this number.
Ok
Hello, Hello, why didn't you call me back?
Why are you not saying anything?
I will give you time till tomorrow evening.
This might be the guy with Shine
on the bike.
In that case, we need to find him.
Another guy is also calling in between,
we need to find him also.
Is there any Mosque nearby?
There is one nearby, about 2km farfrom here.

After my legs got hurt,
ljust pray at home only.
There is another mosque at Chittatumukku,
about 5-6km far.
What's the matter?
While he was talking,
I heard the prayerfrom a mosque.
I think he is somewhere near one of those
mosques.
We need to find him before tomorrow evening,
or we will be in trouble.
Till he picks up the call,
we need to call on that number
from a public booth.
Rest, I will take care.
See you dear, I will come tomorrow.
Stop there!
You couldn't be a good husband
and there is no time for that.
But you can be a good father.
If you take good care of her,
she will be of use when you get old.
Don't spoil yourself drinking.
You don't have to be good
just because I told you to.
I will go back after 10-15 days.
If you do, your sins will be forgiven.
Please..
Come.
What's up?
There isn't any of his schoolmates living
nearby.
Let's check at Chittatupallimukku.
Get into the vehicle.
When I saw yourface in the news,
I understood everything.
You should be working hard to save the boy.
But the time is very less now.
Yes, but I have decided to save my son.
l have to do that somehow.
Abdukka,
Ok, alrig ht.
It is Abdukka,
Police had come for enquiry.
You need to go to the police club
for identification parade.
Ok, call him.
Alex!
Come! See if the person riding
the bike is there among these?
One criminal may have like
towards another criminal.
Don't do that here.
Go and look carefully.
Who out ofthese?
- None of these Sir.
- Did you see carefully?
Yes Sir.
Ok, you may go.
Alex, you stop there.
Do you know this guy?
Do you know this guy?
Do you know him?
Tell me!
Don't you know him?
Sir, he is my son.
Your act, pretending like
you don't know your own son, is great.
You are smart.
Alex, the bike in the CCTV and the
one on which he came, are similar.
You are the only witness of guard's attack.
What do you say?
According to your statement,
the guard had clutched on to
one person's neck during the attack.
Yes Sir.
Did he clutch with left or right hand?
I don't remember exactly.
I understand that you are lying now.
But it's of no use.
Look, he has got a nail scratch
scar on his neck.
If your statement and this is related,
then it will be a god's signature
against the accused.
Tomorrow, we will receive the forensic report.
lfthe tissues under his nails belong to him,
then you have lot to worry.
It is my duty to investigate this case.
You can go now.
What happened?
I saw my son.
Did you hide him
from me all this time, forthis?
Did I wait all this time
to see him like this?
You could have told me.
Alex.
What are you thinking about, Alex?
lam losing control of my mind.
Thinking about my son...
Nothing will happen to him.
I shouldn't have come out ofjail.
It's even worse outside than inside the jail.
Here is the money.
What happened?
lgotthis phone unlocked in afriend's shop.
These are the numbers I got from it.
Calls are coming continuously from two
numbers.
Yes, this guy called many times
on the day of incident and next day.
About 12 times.
Did you find his house?
We enquired near Chittattumuku mosque area.
There are two children who
study in Shine's school.
Out ofthem, one is a girl.
And the other?
That was a police man's house.
So, we came back.
Why should we get into trouble unnecessarily?
His name is Benoy.
This Benoy and my friend's son usually
come to the ground to play football.
- Sir!
- What?
Did you come to influence me?
No, I came to see you.
You told me about the God's
signature against the culprit,
That's what you are listening to now.
Here is the list ofthe calls that came
from morning on the day of incident
till one hour before the incident,
To the mobile which fell off culprit's pocket.
Next day also, calls have come after
knowing about the guard's death news.
Shall I tell you one more thing?
As you said, ifthe tissue
under guard's nail belong to my son,
then this guy will also become accused.
the guard died as he hit his head on the wall
lam the only witness for all these.
Hope you understood now
who shall also be accused with him.
Who are you to teach police about
investigation?
lam not teaching you about investigation.
I need to save my son.
That too within limited time.
Being the investigation officer,
only you can do something.
Don't considerthese as words of a prisoner,
but a request from a father.
If you investigate in the right way,
both our children will be trapped.
Don't send them to jail.
lam saying this as I know about
all the difficulties in jail.
You please think about it and take a decision.
Alex, there is one more secret
that I hid from you till now.
It is true that Shine signed
the paper for your parole.
But he demanded Rs.25000 to me for that.
l arranged that money
He gave that money to Sudarsan,
To buy cannabis and cannabis oil.
Now he is in such a situation
that he will do anything for money.
Knowing thatthere is no use in advising him,
I tried to get Sudarsan caught by police.
This is the gift he gave me forthat.
Do you know that Shine Philipose?
Tell me what all things you have done.
Shine Philip is my friend.
Dad, I don't know what to do.
Sir, why are you here?
I came to see Alex.
What is the matter?
You have to present your son,
We need to get some details from him.
But he is in your custody, isn't he?
No, I sent him with your advocate.
I didn't send any advocate.
Then, where is he?
Sir, lwill find my son.
But you have to make a promise
That you will save him
along with your son.
Where is my son?
He won't be coming now
l have only few more hours left
before I go back.
So, I will repay all the debts.
Also, I shall repay for what you had done
to Abdukka, who is like a brotherto me.
I shall forgive you for what you did to me.
But if I forgive you
for what you did to my son,
My Annie will not forgive me.
Keep this, it will be useful to walk.
Take him to thejeep.
Get up
Take him to the jeep
