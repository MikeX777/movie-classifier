In history, tell me of one movement, where arms have not been taken up.
It's India's non violent struggle that gave us an enslaved Kashmir.
True, wars have been waged with the pen, printing pamphlets...
...but they have not been Won.
And if we have won, then tell me which ones.
Majid...
You see these teenagers? Tomorrow, they'll be killed too...
...and we will be guilty for not teaching them the true...
...essence of our war for freedom, nor how to win that war!
Aslam!
This is an Indian soldier. Don't you see in him the...
...man who burnt down your press?
I, Al-Sami, Commander-in-Chief of Al-jihad...
...want to inform you Shakeel...
...that to obtain our rights, we don't need the permission...
...of the Indian government, nor adhere to the rules of the UN.
First visit Sir?
- I came here 15 years ago.
When I was a small kid.
- The situation between...
...then and now has changed...
And these terrorist?
- Now terrorists target the locals as well.
They just want blood-shed.
In my five years of training I learnt this very well...
...that Kashmir's only language is a gun...
...it doesn't matter whether it is theirs or ours.
Who's Shakeel?
- He's Second-in-command of the...
...Al-jihad terrorist group. Al-Sami is their chief.

You shouldn't hesitate while hitting with the butt of your gun.
If in doubt, you are dead.
The honor of your Regiment is in your hands. Dismissed!
You really have a good aim.
You'll enjoy leading them. How was the game, soldiers?
Very good, sir!
- Good.
This is your Commander, Captain Aman. This is your platoon.

Our most accurate shot. He's got 34 kills!
He forms the last order! Kumble?
- He's is in the hospital, Sir
So captain... soldiers.
- Yes sir.
And Captain, steer clear of the locals.
So it seems we have an entire cricket team here!
Gurpal, it's been a week and absolutely no action!
It takes a minute for everything to change and then it won't stop.
Is that so?
- Yes sir...
Then it's only plastic bags To shit and piss in!
What happened, sir?
That's an informer, Sir. You can't trust anybody here.
Never know who else they are informing!

Let's go... come on.

Adaa... Open the door!
Hide it! Under the bed!
Hey open the door.
What's happening here?
- Hair Oil!
- Studying!
All at the same time! Did you go to school?
We got let off early.
- They said there was a bomb there!
Adaa!
- Gulzar? Get out of here!
What's this? Hmmmm...
Classes finished early?
- The Army has located Javed.
So why the long face?
- The Army has found him.
Hey bring Kaaba for him...
Mama, there's letter from the Chambu's
They want to see Adaa...
- Is that so?
Where are you going? Sit beside me.
Gulzar, she is doing wonders with her hand work
It's all God's grace.
That denim masterpiece isn't Too bad. Right, Adaa?
Won't it need a lot of time to be accepted here?
Not that long, Grandma.
28 days, and still no information about my son.
I hope that he's safe.
They don't even tell me if they have him in custody!
Javed Ahmed son of Sharif Ahmed!
Father...
- Javed, .
My son, my son...
Please sign here...
We are letting him go because we know he was kidnapped and...
...forced to train in their camp.
- Thank you sir.
Now his life is in your hands.
- Yes thank you sir.
Next, your name?
This is our bunker.
Gurpal, can we get some tea?
- Tea at this hour?
It's hard to believe that most movies were filmed here.
It's been a decade since a film crew dare to come here
Now these people aren't sacred of guns and bullets either.
They are speaking about Shammi Kapoor.
But who is this Shammi Kapoor?
- He's an actor.
Hey let me sleep.
But why would he dance here?
How should I know about it?
- Keep quiet.
Please tell us sister.
Hello? Can we get some tea?
- Sir, not to the locals!
Look, we're from the Army It's really cold here.
Sir! I'll arrange for it!
What's all this noise?!
Halt...
If you want tea, tug on the rope once. If not, tug it on twice.
And if you want to throw it, pull it thrice!
Sir, do check it properly.
- I'll have to drink it to check it...
If you've finished with the tea, pull once. If not, pull twice.
And if you want more, keep pulling but you won't get any!
Let go... please!
I said let go of the rope!
You!
Sir, not the torch!
Turn off the torch!
Humph!
Some guts!
He's an Army man... said it was cold, so I made them some tea...
Why did he flash the torch?
- I don't know...!
Was there only one glass?
- He drank the glass as well!
They are still here?
- It got late. Curfew had started.
Sir, you shouldn't use torch here, this is Kashmir.
I'll deal with him!!
Do it in the morning Grandma!
- You keep quiet!
Sir, she's here!
- Who?
Why did you flash your torch at Adaa?
Adaa?
- Yes my granddaughter.
Her name is Adaa?
Good Lord! He knows her name!
- You just told me, Ma'am!
Why did you do it?
- She gave me tea.
I just wanted to see her face.
Do you have to look at every girl who gives you tea?
Her father's asleep or you would have a kettle down your throat!
What's this?
- Uh... cigarettes.
Give me one!
Name?
- Aman
Not yours, moron! The cigarette's?
- Oh... Benson...
Ever had local tobacco? Give me another!
Just 2 left, Ma'am. Take the packet.
No torches anymore!
You're from that house?
How did you come out in the curfew?
Our glass... Why did you keep it last night?
So I could see you again.
- Are you out of your mind?
Since last night...
This is Kashmir! It makes mice out of the biggest studs!
I was hoping for that!
- Why did you give grandma cigarettes?
Yes!
- Why?
You had given me tea.
- Keep this, local tobacco.
How did you come about this?
I have ears too and I heard everything.
And don't you dare teach Grandma any more bad habits!
Come on Shree.
Is she your sister?
- Do you have a problem?
Why does she giggle so much?
At least someone is smiling here. You don't like that either?
Come in...
I don't have any glass that belongs to you. Come in.
What a pretty smile! Do you have a name?
Won't you tell me? Won't you speak with me?
Shree is a Hindu. A few years ago terrorists attacked her...
...village and massacred her family. A bullet grazed her throat and...
...she lost her speech ever since.
- And these people?
They adopted her despite being Muslims.
Now they celebrate every festival for her.
And that girl takes her as her younger sister.
I am off duty now, sir...
...I won't speak in an army language.
Sir, just see what kind of a place is this & what kind of people stay here.
But sir, they to are crushed between their animosity
Today, at least there's some activity going around...
it's so colourful here.
No, no, show me that.
I don't know how it looks on me?
I want this jewellery only.
Hi...
Recognize me?
- Uh... Yes...
Last night...
Yes... last night...
- Tea...
Tea? Yes, he came to tea last night.
- At night?
The local tobacco?
- Yes, he came for some tobacco...
What are you blabbering, Adaa?
I mean he came to sell... to buy tobacco. From... Where?
I'm from Pune
Pune? He came all the way here to buy tobacco?!
Let's go to the jewellery shop.
- That's where we are!
Right! Let's leave!
Who's he?
- Don't know.
Looks like an Army man.
- You do know what had happened to Rehana?
I'd better go. Greetings.
Hey...
Hey! Listen...
Me?
Why did you greet me in public!!
I'll greet you only in private then!
Do you know what happens here to a girl found talking to a soldier?
What happens?
- She's either raped or her house...
...gets bombed! Understood?
- So I'm to pretend I don't know...
...you, in public.
- Why did You create such dolts?
Why hurt yourself for His mistake?
- Your logic! I'm leaving.
Adaa!
At least don't call out my name so loud! Please!
Grandma, when will all this end?
All what?
All this violence, hatred and fear in the Valley.
Stop worrying about Kashmir! Just get married and go!
Where should I go?
Anywhere. But far away from here.
And look, I don't like that soldier!
Does he still flash his torch at you?
No!
What is it?
- My officer has called your daughter.
Who?
- Aman sir, who stays in the bunker opposite to your house.
The gall of the man! You're not going anywhere!
Not her. The little girl. ...and you along with her.
Gopal, this is your prescription.
Doctor, this is the girl, I was talking about.
Come in Shree... Come and sit here.
Come and sit here, dear.
Show me your throat child.
Just pass me the torch captain.
How long has she been unable to talk?
- Two years.
Captain, it seems to be curable.
But I'll be able to diagnose it properly after some x-rays and tests.
I'll write it down, seeing the results...
...l'll be able to take any decisions.
Thank you very much doctor!
- No problem Captain.
These are the prescriptions.
Will you come to Chandigarh?
I know someone at that Military Hospital.
The treatment won't cost much.
I'll get the living arrangements done.
We'll think about it.
Bye Shree...
- Thank you!
Gurpal! Gurpal!
How's your torch doing?
- Sorry?
How's your torch doing?
- It's not working.
Then how do you drink tea?
- Gurpal makes it for me, Ma'am.
Hmmm... Get it fixed.
Hey it's my turn now. See didn't I tell you?
See I got it out, now it's your turn...
...let's see if you can get it out or not.
Yes I can do, like this.
Peace efforts in Kashmir suffered a huge setback when militants...
...killed 32 civilians in Kanhabal. The victims include 8 children.
It's suspected that Al-Jihad's, Shakeel Ahmed is behind the attack.
Today you'll see the real Kashmir. 32 people have been killed.
If we launch an aggressive enquiry Human Rights activists claim...
...'Military atrocities'.
If we don't the death toll triples by tomorrow!
So, in all of this, only listen to your conscience.
Let's move Jawans.
Get down...
Round up everyone!
Did the militants come here? Tell me the truth!
I am telling you the truth...
They didn't stay at our house! They attacked the entire village!
Liar! You don't deserve to live! Did they come?
Everything is clear sir...
- So go and search in the other places.
Come on tell me, they had come here?
Please sir!
This is enough, sir.
Do you know whom you are speaking to?
- Yes sir.
This is against Army Rules, Sir!
- So you'll teach me the rules, eh?
I'll report this, Sir!
You'll report me?
- I'm sorry sir. But I will.
Move! Dismissed!
Get them some water!
- Yes sir.
Greetings sir...
- Greetings.
Majid, what happened to your face?
I kept quiet because of you, otherwise I would've had shot him.
But what happened?
- He was bad mouthing us.
He said we should be grateful for...
...being allowed to enter here. That we're outsiders and should stay
...out of the Valley's affairs.
Where is he?
- Here I am!
What's this?
'Terrorist Attack in Kanhabal'
Why was this done?
- There were military informers there.
8 children? How were they military informers?
Informers have no age. It's been long since an attack occurred here.
We need to remind India that we're around. That's the way of war.
Our war is with the Indian Army. And it better stay that way.
We have new orders. There have to be three more attacks.
I didn't join you to take orders! Kashmir is mine and to restore my...
...people their rights, I don't need a hired mercenary like you!
Moin...
Can't we break away from them?
It's not the right time, Moin, but it won't be long either.
It's my daughter's wedding today. Is everything alright?
Of course, just routine duty.
Nothing to worry about. There's crowd here so we were just checking.
It's very cold outside would you like some tea?
For my soldiers please!
- I'll just get it for them.
Check upstairs too.
- Sir.
Tea?
- Give it to my soldiers.
Tea?
Did everyone else take it?
They have. This one is yours.
- Can't see my name on it.
I'll write it, if you wish so.
This white... doesn't suit!
You were on duty in Kulgaon? How was the bride's father?
He's ok, Sir. A little sad seeing his daughter leave.
And the whole of village is mourning today. Thirty bullet injuries!
His corpse was found near the ditch.
Impossible, Sir! I went off duty half an hour ago.
Here, dozens are killed in less than half an hour.
You can be court-martialed for this.
This occurred after my duty hours.
It happened despite being on duty. It's the same bloody Shakeel!
This point is 28 kms. From here.
I don't know if I will return alive from this mission.
If I don't, then think of us
...as a beautiful dream that died. And if I do come back know that...
...this dream will a reality soon Read ahead carefully...
There are two entry points in this village.
One from the south and one from the north west.
We can enter from here, sir.
I will go, sir.
- No.
Ready?
- Yes, sir.
Surrender or we will open fire!
Who is he?
- That's Al-Sami! The Al-Jihad Chief!
The Major has given us orders. Take no prisoners!
No! Hold your fire!
Hands behind your head!
'Allah-O-Akbar! '
'Al-Jihad Chief Al-Sami in Custody...
...4 soldiers die in Encounter'
This... news...
- Soldiers live to die, Miss!
Please don't say that!
- When I left home, I told my wife I...
...was on a one-way ticket to Kashmir!
- Ya Allah!
Pray to Him... He answers everyone's prayers!
This... paper...
Did you get hurt?
One bullet... just grazed past me!
In my remembrance, Think of me as the color of love
Tracing me with your fingers, Mark my fair body with my name Adaa
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
Come along with me, Losing ourselves in the flowing river
Soon, a new dawn will arrive Enveloping...
...our Valley with a new spring
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
Remember me as the fresh mist of a bright morning.
As the snow falls... etch my name as Goodwill
At times it is the fire nearby.
At times it is the warmth of the fire.
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
Let the night not pass, as you are here.
Your smile ushers in my day
Your embrace mellows me to sleep
Keep me by your side until you make me yours forever
The sunshine will embrace us.
The colours will envelope us.
The sunshine will embrace us.
The colours will envelope us.
My memories consist of the colours of henna.
Etch my name with your finger.
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
Sometimes the moon shines on us
At other times, the setting sun
I'm Gulzar, Adaa's father.
Please come in. Have a sit.
I need not speak the reason of my arrival.
After all we have been through, the only thing we have is our dignity.
And you Army people don't have any regards for that! We know we're...
...a fear-stricken, destitute lot. And you are equally to blame as...
...the militants from across!
And don't think that our blood has turned water.
As a father, I have the right to slap you.
And by God, I will not repent it.
But as the father of...
...a Kashmiri girl, I have to bear the humiliation.
Is this how you protect us?
You are playing with our dignity.
Adaa's marriage has been arranged.
She will leave the Valley soon.
If you have a sister at home...
...keep off your hands from Adaa for her sake.
Allow us to live peacefully.
Father...
Which way to the Army camp?
