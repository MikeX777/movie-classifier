 Never get too big 
 Never get too heavy 
 Never get too cool
you stop paying your dues 
 Oh, yeah 
 What can a poor boy do? 
 Better go back
to your mama 
 Oh, she'll take care
of you 
Christ, I won't miss
that country rubbish
first thing in the morning.
I bet you'll
miss me though, eh?
I hope a get the chance to.
 Stay out drinking
till the morning comes 
 Oh, yeah 
 What can a poor boy do? 
Autograph, please.
You're gonna be
the next Dolly Parton!
Enjoy yourself, hen!
 Cheerio!
Cheerio! Cheerio! 
Fuck! Go on, girls!
 Country girl,
take my hand 
 Lead me through
this diseased land 
Keep your foot still, please.
 I am tired, I am weak 
I've appealed it,
so it'll be off before it's on.
Well, while it's on,
you cannot leave
the registered address
after 7:00 at night
until 7:00 the next morning.
Is that me?
 Country girl,
got to keep on keeping on 
Fuck's sake.
 Crazy woman,
mess your head 
 Wake up drunk and bleeding
in some strange bed 
 Oh, yeah 
 What can a poor boy do? 
And don't come back!
 You better go back
to your mama 
 Oh, she'll take care
of you 
 Oh, country girl 
 Take my hand 
 Lead me through
this diseased land 
 I am tired, I am weak 
 I am worn 
 I have stole,
I have sinned 
 Oh, my soul is unclean 
 Country girl 
 Got to keep on keeping on 
 Country girl 
 Got to keep on keeping on 
 I go out walkin' 
 After midnight 
 Out in the moonlight 
 Just like we used to do 
 I'm always walkin' a... 
He's in his bath.
"Hello, Rose-Lynn.
Would you like a cup of tea?
How are you?"
 I'm always walkin' 
 After midnight 
-  Searching for you 
- Oh!
Cover yourself,
for God's sake!
Cover yourself!
Oh!
Oh, fuck, yeah.
All
the way from Glasgow, Scotland,
please welcome a little girl
by the name
of Rose-Lynn Harlan
to the Opry.
Rose-Lynn Harlan,
ladies and gentlemen,
performing for the first time
here in Nashville, Tennessee.
Whoo!
Fucking "A."
Right. I'll see you.
When?
When?
Mum!
Ooh. Hi.
- Come on, Lyle.
- Come.
Where do you think
you're going,
all done up like a fish supper?
I see he's got you down,
so he has.
That's scary.
Don't do that.
Anyway,
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm having
my dinner with you.
"No, down this way."
"No, go this way."
He never shuts up;
you never speak.
What's going on in there, eh?
Sponsored silence?
Did you miss me? Hmm?
Rose-Lynn!
I thought you were
your mum there.
That can't have
been 12 month.
The time's went by like that.
Yeah.
Hello, Marion!
Night, both of you.
She looks good, Amanda.
Oh, so she should.
Enough time at it.
Does she still lie
out here on tinfoil?
Oh... one peek of the sun
and that one's in a bikini.
Other day, she was in
after my butter.
- Your butter?
- Puts it all over.
"It's natural, Marion."
Aye. Natural if you're a roll.
Mary was gonna come tonight
and see you,
but she's awful bad
with her arthritis, so...
Och, that's a shame.
Aye.
It's in her knees now,
so that's her had to retire.
So...
£8 an hour.
Holidays.
Says she'll see you into it
as a favor to me.
Cleaning, ah? Aye.
Very good.
Why? What were you thinking?
Thinking? No.
I wasn't thinking.
I just got out.
Don't you worry about me.
No, I wasn't.
I was thinking about your kids.
I'm going to Nashville.
Well, you better mind
your tag doesn't go off
when you're going
through security.
First thing the morrow,
I'm going down the Opry,
I'm gonna get my job back,
and I'm gonna work for it.
There's nothing for me here.
See, there, I can be
honing my craft.
I can be out gigging
every night.
Honing your cr...
Do you not think
you've sacrificed enough
for that fantasy?
Have we all not sacrificed
enough for that fantasy?
It isn't a fantasy.
It's the only thing
I'm good at.
Learn a trade, Rose-Lynn.
Go to college.
- You're not listening!
- Cut hair... I don't care
what you do,
but do something.
I've got my talent,
and I'm gonna use that.
Have you not
been watching telly?
'Cause I'll tell you something:
there's no shortage
of folk who can sing.
By a distinctive whistle...
As they fly home
over the water.
Sake!
-  I beg your pardon 
- Here we go!
Step and swivel.
Back and back.
Out, in.
 I never promised you
a rose garden 
-  Along with the sunshine 
- Here's the turn!
Come on, Sandra.
Watch your feet.
Ah, the Lone Ranger
rides into town.
You wanna get me
a wee beer, Jackie?
Come on, Laurie.
You can't afford to chat.
Watch me.
Don't watch your neighbor.
Eyes on me, not your neighbor.
So what have I missed?
Well, was there mice
when you were here before?
Aye.
Well, then there's
nothing new under the sun.
Hear you're on the tag.
Can't fart round here.
Aye, I am,
but I've appealed it,
so a couple of weeks,
I'll be brand-new.
Fridays and Saturdays.
Boom.
Rocking chair!
Fridays and Saturdays,
we've got Mississippi Tundra.
- Who?
- And swivel.
Back and back. Out, in.
Oh, you must be desperate.
Nobody wants to see
a convicted criminal up there.
Folk come here
to get away from all that.
Johnny Cash is a convicted
criminal, you bawbag.
Go on away...
away back to your mousetraps!
I need this job, Jackie.
It's my fucking band!
It's the house band!
You're your own worst enemy,
you.
I wouldnae agree.
There's strong competition.
- What the fuck?
- You stupid fucker!
Jackie!
You nicked my job,
you ratcatcher!
Get off me!
- Get off!
- Get your hands off me!
Get out.
Ten years,
I've been working here.
- What am I supposed to do now?
- You're barred. Get out!
Fucking no-fucking-hopers
clubhouse.
- You're an animal!
- Bunch of cunts.
An animal!
Fuck!
Didn't know you
were on mornings.
How's your lassie?
Ugh. Ask me tomorrow.
He lives in the bottom half,
um, of the house,
and then there's
another house up the stair.
My mate Angie lives there.
And then they bought
the house next door.
So Lauren lives next door,
where wee Doug...
 I've been living
on the wrong side of Memphis 
 Really breaking away
this time 
 A full tank of gas
and a '69 Tempest 
 Taking me
to that Nashville sign 
 No turning back 
 I've come too far 
 Headed down 40
with my old guitar 
 I ain't driving
no pink Cadillac 
 I've been living
on the wrong side of Memphis 
Fuck's sake.
 These cowboy boots
are getting kind of restless 
 They ain't got
a single thing to lose 
They've got CCTV,
so anything you do
to that gate,
we can see from in here.
I've not done
anything to the gate.
You were effing
and blinding at the gate.
Shoes off.
No, it's far too much.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What? He's got a Kindle or...
Yes.
What, will you...
Look, I only sent
the email round
because it feels like we're all
just buying too much plastic.
Aww, that's so sweet.
No, yeah.
That's fine. That's fine.
Come in. Sit down.
Yeah, I've got to go.
I've got somewhere here.
Aww. Okay.
Pleasure.
Speak to you later. Bye.
Hello.
I'm Susannah.
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.
So, um, where have you been
working before now?
She's been up in Stirling.
Haven't you, Rose-Lynn?
But she's no plans to go back.
Oh, it's beautiful
up there.
Majestic.
Right.
I'm off to spend a penny.
So it's £12 an hour.
£12?
Actually, Mary gets...
£8, right,
but she can afford
to go that low
because she's on
the brew as well.
Brew?
She drinks?
- I don't think Mary dr...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The brew is, like, you know,
the dole.
Like, on welfare.
Really?
Whereas, you know, I'll not
be up to anything like that.
It's just not me.
Know what I mean?
Don't embarrass her
by mentioning it.
Oh, you'll be needing
more bleach, Susannah.
I'll give you
the receipt for it.
Okay. Thanks.
Rose-Lynn?
- Oh! Jeez.
- Rose-Lynn?
Sorry.
Um... um, I'm just gonna pop out,
and, uh, I'll be back
in about an hour, okay?
Okay.
Oh, uh... or maybe less.
I...
I don't...
I'm in and out all day,
so I... I don't know
when I'll be back.
Just, uh...
Great.
Right. See you in a bit.
Ah.
 Well, you've broken your vow,
and it's over 
 But someday, baby,
when you've had your play 
 You're gonna want your mama,
but your mama will say 
 Keep movin' on 
 You've been away too long 
 Well, I'm through with you 
 It's too bad you're blue 
 I'm movin' on 
Hey!
 That big eight-wheeler
rollin' down the track 
 Means your true-lovin' mama
ain't coming back 
 I'm movin' on 
 I'll soon be gone 
 You were flyin' too high
for my little sky 
Oh! Jesus fuck!
You gave me a shock.
Where's your mum?
- Parking the car.
- Parking the car.
You're like something
out of "The Shining."
What's "The Shining"?
Well, you coming in?
There's a yeasty
smell in here.
Right, what kind
of smell is it?
Yeasty.
What smell?
Well,
I don't know what it is,
but it sure as hell
isn't somebody baking bread.
Okay, bear with me a minute.
She won't touch ham,
and he won't eat
anything else.
And they've both now decided
they don't like yogurt.
Have you got a calendar?
You need a calendar
for putting down their gym days
and their holidays
and if they're needing
to bring something in.
Nine times out of ten,
they won't tell you.
- Yeah.
- So you need to go
through their bags
once a week.
And you need to pay these.
You can do it.
You've got a wage now,
and you can pay
in installments.
Your gas, your water,
and your electricity, and...
there's your TV license
as well.
Okey-smoky.
Well, that's you set up here.
Now, remember, you have to be
in immediate range of that
from 7:00 at night until
7:00 in the morning, okay?
Hello?
- Aye.
- Excuse me?
Aye. Yeah?
Is that your wee boy
out here?
- Hiyah!
- Lyle.
Open up! It's the police!
- Lyle.
- Hiyah!
Lyle.
- Hi...
- Get in here!
Right now.
Right. That's me away.
You know where I am
if you need me.
No, no. You're staying here
with your mammy,
but you'll see me every day.
You'll see me every day,
you daftie.
I'm coming home with you.
No, you stay with your mammy.
Now, be a good boy
for your mammy.
Come on.
Take hold of him now.
Keep hold of him.
I want to go with my granny!
No, you're not...
Shh.
No, Lyle.
I don't wanna stay here!
See, on Friday,
will we go out for our dinner?
I remember
what your favorite is.
It's pizza.
I like sausage,
cheese, tomato.
She likes cheese,
tomato, and cheese.
Are you coming with us?
Hmm?
- Right. That's me done.
- Okay.
The kids tell me you're
a country and western singer.
You taking the piss?
No.
Not at all.
Why do you say that?
"Country and western"?
No, it's just country.
I didn't realize.
You must be very good,
because all I've heard all week
is Rose-Lynn, Rose-Lynn,
Rose-Lynn.
Why country?
'Cause it's three chords
and the truth.
Wow.
Yeah. It goes like that.
Just gets
whatever's in there out.
Anyways,
I'll see you next week.
Thanks very much.
Bye!
Bye.
All right. Thanks.
Oh, sorry. After you.
Him? That fucking prick?
Oh.
Shit. I'm sorry, mate. Fuck.
Fuck.
- Watch yourself.
- Sorry, pal.
- Sorry.
- Ah, I don't mind. It's fine.
Ah. I'm all right, Davey.
- That's me.
- No, no, no.
I just fell on the floor.
- Where are you going?
- I've got my curfew.
Never mind the curfew.
Come on. Stay.
Here, take it.
Drink mine.
Stay. Oi!
Fuck!
Hello, Galloway's
the butchers.
What can I get you?
No, I'm playing with you.
I'm playing with you.
I'm only kidding you on.
Aye, yeah.
Rose-Lynn Harlan. I'm here.
All right. Okay. Bye.
What happened to pizza?
You can't promise them
something
and then just disappear.
- You cannae do that.
- I didn't disappear.
I... I was at my work,
waiting on my wages.
Oh, please.
You're not fooling anybody,
Rose-Lynn,
and you cannae fool me.
If you tell them something,
you don't go back on it.
That's basic.
That's basic.
Right. Pizza.
Come on.
You don't like pizza.
Oh, don't you worry
about me, darling.
I'll have something else.
You can get chocolate pizza.
Did you know that?
- Chocolate pizza?
- Aye.
 I am an old woman 
 Named after my mother 
 My old man is another 
 Child that's grown old 
 If dreams were thunder 
 And lightning was desire 
 This old house
would have burnt down 
 A long time ago 
 Make me an angel 
 That flies from Montgomery 
 Make me a poster 
 The jukebox playing 
 The tune about 
 The wild side of life 
 As I listen to the words 
Kitty Wells.
What a trailblazer.
I've been listening
to this stuff
since you left on Friday,
and I can't stop.
It's a revelation.
See you in a bit.
 It wasn't God 
 Who made honky-tonk angels 
 As you said
in the words of your song 
Come in.
Yeah, I... I was, um...
I was just thinking I could
give you some recommendations.
Like, strong women
and all that.
Oh, I'd love that.
I'd love that.
I'd love to hear you sing.
Where do you sing?
Is there, um...
is there a scene?
Oh. No, no.
No, there's fuck all here.
It's actually... I'm...
well, I'm actually trying
to get to Nashville, you know.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm needing to raise
a couple of grand
so I can get flights
and hotel and...
well, I can't drive, so I'm
needing a driver as well.
And it wouldnae be
more than two or three.
Definitely less than five.
Oh.
Rose-Lynn, I... I'm sorry.
I can't just give you money,
if that's what
you're suggesting,
which I'm sure it wasn't.
No, it was.
I can't do that.
How no?
I'm not being funny,
but I just kind of thought
with all the wee smelly candles
burning everywhere
and bottled water
and all that, you know,
you wouldn't miss it.
I'll be old and gray
before I save the money,
whereas you... you could just
drink out of the tap.
Anyway, never mind.
What are you actually doing
while you're waiting,
saving to go?
I've been
the star fucking attraction
at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry
since I was 14.
- And?
- And what?
And nothing.
Well, haven't you gone in
for one of those...
those TV talent shows?
They're not for folk who can
sing, those programs.
They're for folk
who want to sit in
on a Saturday night
and watch the TV.
Yeah, but isn't it a way
of meeting someone here
who can introduce you
to someone over there?
There's nobody here.
That's why I'm away.
No one in the whole of Britain
knows anything
about country music?
- Except me.
- Except you.
Yeah, and Bob Harris.
Who's that?
Well, he's a DJ
at BBC Radio 2.
Pure legend, man.
Ancient wee guy.
And he knows everything about
country music... all the stars.
They're his pals.
That's great.
That's who you need
to write to.
Aye, yeah.
It's good thinking.
I'll just away
and pop round his house.
No, I can't do this.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I feel like a fanny.
- Okay, you two.
- Go on outside.
- No.
- Yes. Ten minutes.
All we're gonna do
is listen outside the door.
It's... it's fine.
- It's fine. It's cool.
- Sure?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
 Hey, kids,
turn off the TV 
 No, I don't wanna
watch the evening news 
 So come on over here 
 Sit down next to me 
 And let your mama
look at you 
 And you and you 
 Your beautiful faces 
 That I wanna keep safe as 
 Long as I can 
 I'm telling you right now 
 There's gonna be
peace in this house 
 There's gonna be peace
in this house 
 Gonna be some
tender talking 
 And some sweet
little nothings that 
 Add up to the somethings 
 We can't live without 
 There's gonna be
peace in this house 
 Some belief
in this house 
 Every good thing
that ever happens 
 Happens from
the inside out 
 I'm telling you now 
 There's gonna be peace 
Goodness.
Amazing.
Amazing.
You have such
an incredible voice.
Wow.
How do you do it?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
Thanks.
So where do you stay,
Rose-Lynn?
Priesthill.
Ah, Pollok way?
Aye, yeah.
Sam's from Clydebank.
Clydebank?
How'd you get here
from Clydebank?
Break in through a window?
Learned a trade
from my father,
and then I started up
on my own.
Ah. What trade?
Conservatories?
What, as in
they big glass things
stuck on the side of houses?
- Hmm.
- I'm not being funny,
but who needs
a conservatory in Glasgow?
You'd be surprised.
Aye. I would be.
- What are you looking for?
- iPad.
Did Mum say you can have it?
- No.
- No.
Tell you what: let's go
play some football, eh?
Oh, you're getting heavy, boy.
Out of that uniform
and get some socks out.
Do you want kids, Rose-Lynn?
Aye, yeah.
Just not yet.
How was school today?
Is Mrs. Pat still there?
Ah, sh... she hated me, Mrs. Pat.
Is Ms. McDonald
still your favorite?
Ms. McDonald left.
You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm?
I've got something.
"Dear Susannah,
"so wonderful to hear from you
after all this time.
"I passed your email on to Liz.
Remember, Liz used
to piss in the sink."
She... um, oh, she works
on "The Today Programme,"
and she sent the link
to her husband,
who covers sport for Radio 2,
and he forwarded the link
to Bob Harris' producer.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Wait.
"Bob will be very happy
to meet her
"if she fancied coming
down to London
- to watch a live recording."
- What?
Do you know how many times
I've written
to that wee bastard
and how many BBC pens
I got back in return?
How'd you do that?
How'd you even fucking do that?
Sent a few emails.
I can't... I can't believe it.
I'm fucking shaking.
Like, that is just...
- Aww.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah, y...
- That is fucking mental.
Brilliant! Whoo!
Bob Harris?
"Whispering Bob Harris"?
Aye.
 BBC Radio 2 
Aye.
I know. I know.
It's mad.
That'll be some doors
he could open for you.
Is... is it all right
if you babysit?
Oh, of course she will.
How did this come about?
Susannah.
Oh.
Very nice of her to help you.
Can she unlock tags as well?
You served 12 months
for attempting to smuggle
a package of heroin
into Cornton Vale
by throwing it over
the perimeter fence.
I didn't know it was heroin.
But you were reckless as to
what the package contained.
Well, if you mean
I was off my face
and didn't ask what was in it,
then aye.
But I had kids and everything,
and they put me in jail.
It's pure ridiculous.
And that's what
my advocate said at the time.
It's not my fault.
Well, whose fault was it?
Well, it was
the judge's, obviously,
for giving me the sentence.
Your Lordship,
a more contrite young lady,
it would be hard to find.
Miss Harlan has done
a lot of soul-searching.
She has dug deep...
and she's put her childish ways
behind her.
She now works full-time
as a daily woman,
and her children are living
with her once again.
Though Miss Harlan
is no longer in prison,
neither is she free.
Wearing a tag means she
is unable to seek employment
in her own line of work.
You just told me
she's a daily woman.
Yes, but if you
turn the page, sir,
you'll see my client is also
a promising young
country and western singer.
It's just country.
It's just country.
My Lord,
this young lady must be
allowed out in the evenings
if she's to make a new start.
- Yay!
- Yeah!
You are barred.
Ah, you can take that up
with my lawyer,
who'll be having
a whiskey and Coke.
Oi, you.
Oi, you, what did I just say?
She's barred!
"Outlaw State of Mind"!
- Jackie!
-  In no time at all 
- Go back to your rat traps.
- What is this?
- Go. Get off.
- What the fuck?
- Sort that out, you.
- This is a joke.
- Off you bop.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Rose-Lynn Harlan!
- Come on!
- Disgrace.
 Cut my teeth 
 On Daddy's old LGO 
 And I lost my mind
somewhere in New Mexico 
 And TW put a snake
on my back 
 I keep a redbone on my side 
 And there's people
all across the land 
 From east Kentucky
down to Alabama 
 Whole lot like I am
all the time 
 I'm in an outlaw
state of mind 
Come on, Glasgow!
Whoo-hoo!
 I got friends who know 
 How to have a good time 
 Yeah, they roll their own 
 Drinking Carolina shine 
 I've seen the devil 
 In a dark coal mine 
 Yeah! 
 I've been higher
than a Georgia pine 
 And there's people
all across the land 
 From west Kentucky
down to Rio Grande 
 Just don't give a damn 
 All the time 
 I'm in an outlaw
state of mind 
Yeah!
Sorry, sorry.
 And there's people
all across the land 
 From New York
down to old San Fran 
 Just don't give a damn 
 All the time 
 I'm in an outlaw state of 
 Mind 
Whoo!
Oh, here's your ticket.
Oh, thank you very much.
What? First class?
I hope you're not
expecting me
to give you the money
for that.
Ah, gracious as ever.
There you go.
Just in case.
Oh, God.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Fuck. Fucking... this is
fucking me off the blocks.
Right.
I'll see you
when I come back, yeah?
Bye. Bye.
We'd like to welcome
passengers
traveling with us today
from Glasgow Central...
Ah, that's good, isn't it?
You get your breakfast.
In coach E.
We'd like to remind passengers
that in the quiet coach,
all electronic devices
should be on silent mode,
and please make your way
to the vestibule
if you need...
- Oh, you're lovely.
- You're fine.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Don't you worry about it.
- He sweats around girls.
- Shut up.
- Free toast.
- You can get free tea.
Free bacon rolls.
And nobody's touching it.
- Not bad, eh?
- No, it's all right.
- It's a waste.
- You want one?
Here, I'll get you one, here.
One sec.
 Bacon rolls,
bacon rolls, bacon rolls 
 Bacon rolls, bacon rolls 
bacon rolls 
- Jump in.
- Go, go.
- See you later. Good luck.
- I'll see you later.
Bye.
You seen my bag?
- Sorry?
- I left my bag here.
I left my bag
and my jacket on the seat.
Um, I think you
took it with you.
No, I didn't take it with me.
I left it here.
It can't just disappear.
Did... did anyone come
and take it?
Shit.
How is it not
your responsibility, right?
'Cause this is all I've
got now... that and these.
Just tell me... tell me,
what is it I'm meant to do?
Okay, as I've said,
the train was thoroughly
checked,
and nothing's been handed in,
so you might be best
talking to the transport police
and getting
a crime reference number.
Are you okay?
Do you need to phone someone?
I'm only trying to help her.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry about this.
Hi, I'm looking for the B...
um, I'm looking for the BBC.
Right, well, okay,
you'll need to take the Tube
- down to...
- What?
- Down to...
- No, I don't have any...
Do you know where the BBC is?
Oh, thank fucking God.
Hi. Rose-Lynn Harlan.
- Who are you here to see?
- Bob Harris.
- Have you got any ID?
- No.
No, some bastard stole my bag
on the way here, so no.
All right, I'm gonna
need you to sign in.
What? Is it MI5 here?
Jeez. They give you less hassle
in the police station.
- Are you Rose-Lynn?
- Aye.
Hello. I'm Mark.
I'm Bob's producer.
Oh, jeez, it's so good
to see you, boy.
You got here, then?
Aye, I did.
So the studio's through here,
and round here
is our control room.
And in the control room
is Bob Harris.
You must be Rose-Lynn.
I cannae believe it.
I can't believe it's you. Oh!
Honest to God,
I thought you'd be tiny wee.
Oh, God,
is that where they go,
Miranda Lambert and all that,
all they folk who come in here?
It is, yeah.
And we've got someone fabulous
playing later.
Would you like to have
a look around?
So this is very exciting,
meeting a homegrown
country star from Glasgow.
I mean, it's a great
music city, Glasgow.
All right, look, I'm trying
to get to Nashville, obviously,
but I mean, who's ever heard
of a country singer
from Glasgow?
That's ridiculous.
It cannae be.
Why not?
Well, uh, see, my life...
my life's like being one
of they transsexuals, you know?
When you're born a man
but you're meant
to come out a lassie.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that is me.
I should've been born
in America.
I... I'm an American.
But here I am.
Do you write?
- Oh, no.
- Can you play?
No.
You know, honestly,
I don't think it matters
whether you're
from Glasgow, Scotland,
or Glasgow, Kentucky.
If you've got a voice
and you've got something
to say...
I watched your link,
and you really do have a voice.
So what do you need to say?
 Don't waste your life 
 Behind that guitar 
 You may get gone 
 But you won't get far 
 You're not the first 
 And won't be the last 
 And you can tell us
all about it 
 When you come crawling back 
 That road you're on 
 Just winds and winds 
 You're spinning
your wheels 
 And wasting your time 
 When the lights come up 
 And I hear the band 
 And where they said
I'd never be 
 Is exactly where I am 
 I hear the crowd 
 I look around, and I can't
find an empty chair 
 Not bad for a girl
goin' nowhere 
No keys?
Where's your bag
and your jacket?
Susannah just picked me up
from the station just now.
I left it on her back seat.
- Was it good?
- Aye.
What like was it, London?
- Ugh, it was heaving.
- Oh, that's what Mary said.
She's been down a couple
of times to see her nephew.
Said you can't move for people.
Honest to God, wherever
you go, people are like that.
Up your nose, in your mouth,
under your nails.
Och, I couldn't stand that.
What was he like? Bob?
I think he was...
well, he was saying I need
to write my own tunes.
But what
am I gonna write about?
"The bleach ran away
with the broom"?
You don't stick at things.
You know, that's your trouble.
But look at this house.
When you put
your mind to something,
you can do anything.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Och, no.
I'm away to my bed.
I'm up early tomorrow.
But you can ask me
for my dinner.
Lyle's after telling me
how he likes
your mince and tatties
and he doesn't like mine.
I don't have a mince.
My mince is your mince.
Night.
Did I wake you up?
No.
I wanted some water.
What's your book about?
About a girl and her dog.
That sounds
a bit babyish for you.
Key Stage 2.
Boo!
Why are you doing that?
I don't know.
Here, I'll take you
back to bed.
Those are nice.
Who are they for?
This one's for Isla,
and this one's for Shona.
Isla and Shona.
You've got half-term coming up.
Do you know that?
Got a whole week off school.
What'll we do, eh?
We could go away
for a few days.
- To the beach.
- I haven't went to the beach.
Yeah, you have.
You were too young to remember.
We went just before...
just before you moved in
with your granny.
You wanted to pick up
all the shells.
Remember that?
How come we were nae
allowed to see you?
'Cause your granny didn't
want you coming to the jail.
Who's gonna bring you
if she won't, eh?
'Cause of baddies?
Aye. Uh-huh.
You werenae a baddy, though.
You were outlaw.
Who told you that?
You did.
No, I wasn't an outlaw.
I was a fanny.
You said "fanny"!
How was it?
I tried calling you
so many times.
Oh, I know.
I lost my phone.
No.
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- I actually got pinched.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, out of my bag.
- Oh.
- With my bag.
- Crap.
But it didn't matter.
- It was fucking "A."
- Was it?
Really?
I'm gonna get there.
I am going to fucking
get there.
Course you bloody are.
- Listen.
- Yeah?
I'm gonna be 50
in a minute,
and I was gonna have
this drinks party
for which I've got
really little enthusiasm for.
'Cause over the weekend,
I realized what I really need
is a party party.
A great big fuck-off
house party,
featuring, say, a set
by a young up-and-coming
country singer,
Rose-Lynn Harlan.
What, you want me to play
at your party?
Yeah.
Will you?
Well, aye, yeah,
course I will.
That is brilliant.
That's not the exciting bit.
The exciting bit is,
instead of bringing gifts,
people will contribute
to a... to a cause
that's very close to my heart:
you.
You perform a set.
If people like what they hear...
which they will...
then they invest in you,
in your career.
That's, like, 100 people
spending between £50 and £100.
Voilà.
By the magic of crowd funding,
you are there.
- Where?
- The Isle of Man.
Nashville!
What, you're gonna tax
your pals to come to your house
for an audience
with your daily woman?
- Yeah.
- You've lost the plot, hen.
Oh, do you have a band?
Aye, yeah.
Of course I do.
- When is it?
- Next Sunday.
You've already booked
the week off,
and you can use that time
to rehearse.
Oh, no.
No, I can't do that week.
But it's cool.
I don't need to rehearse.
I've been playing
with these guys since I was 14.
Rose-Lynn, you definitely
need to rehearse.
If you're asking people
for money,
if... if you want people
to buy into the idea
that you're gonna make it
out there,
then you need to put in
a really professional
performance.
Aye, yeah, cool.
Yeah.
Fucking "A."
Brilliant.
Whoo!
Well, I can't fault it.
Mum, uh, Susannah's
needing me in next week.
Well, she cannae have you.
Kids are on holiday.
She can do without you
for a week.
I know it, but...
You said you'd take them away.
Well, it's no, uh...
it's no cleaning.
Um, I'd be doing...
it's rehearsing.
What it is,
I'm doing this gig at her house
and she's invited
all these people,
and I'm gonna perform
with my band.
And then... then
they're gonna invest.
Invest?
Invest in what?
In me.
In my career.
In getting to Nashville.
Oh.
Don't remember her
investing in Mary
when she was in agony
with her hip.
18-month waiting list.
If she'd money to spare,
she could have
- forked out on that.
- She isn't forking it out.
She gave me a chance
to earn it.
But it's got to be good.
No pub band quality.
And we haven't got long
to put it together,
and I phoned the school
to see about holiday club,
but it's all full up.
And even if it wasn't,
I'd rather they were with you,
you know, 'cause I don't want
them thinking that I've just...
What? Thinking what?
You cast them off
when you get a better offer?
Or that all this is for nothing
'cause you've still got
one foot out the door?
I can't help you.
I havenae booked the time off.
You've been there 20 year.
- Special circumstances.
- I've used that enough.
Aye, when I was fucking up.
What's for you
will no go by you.
This is me trying to make
something of myself,
and surely to God
that's a good thing for them.
A good thing for them?
No letting them down
again and again and again,
that would be
a good thing for them.
And I thought
you'd turned a corner.
More fool me.
- Where are we going?
- We're going to the beach.
We're going to go
into the sea
and look at different
jellyfish.
Come on.
That's a good boy.
Come on.
There we go.
- Oh, in youse come.
- I don't wanna go in there!
- I don't wanna go in there!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Mary's gonna look after you
for a while this week, okay?
I didnae say a week,
Rose-Lynn.
I said today.
Oh, you're fine.
You're fine.
Come on, Mum'll be back
in a wee while.
 Well, I never did crawl 
 And I never did
toe the line 
I know... come on, this is...
it's way too slow.
 Well, I never did crawl
and I never did toe the line 
 No man is master of me 
 I ain't that kind 
 I just put on
my traveling shoes 
 If you wanna win,
you just can't lose the time 
Right.
-  Or stay behind 
- Yep.
 Well, I was born to run 
-  To get ahead of the rest 
- That's mine.
No, it's not.
You've lost yours.
- You gave it to me last night.
- No, I never.
- Liar.
- Lyle, you're lying.
Mum!
 And be someone 
 I was born to be fast,
I was born to run 
- Thanks, Amanda.
- Oh, nae bother, nae bother.
You know me from old,
don't you?
We could play a wee game.
Hotels.
You can be the waiter
and waitress
and I'll be the guest.
See youse later, okay?
I hate you!
 Sure, it makes you
feel nervous 
 But it makes you
feel all right 
- I hate you!
- Right, come on. In.
 Makes you feel all right 
 Well, I was born to run 
 To get ahead of the rest 
 And all I wanted
was to be the best 
 Just to feel free 
 And be someone 
 I was born to be fast,
I was born to run 
 I was born to run 
Mum, look.
 To get ahead of the rest 
 And all I wanted
was to be the best 
 Just to feel free 
She's amazing.
 And be someone 
 I was born to be fast,
I was born to run 
 I was born to be fast,
I was born to run 
Yeah!
That was much better.
Wow, who else
has this lassie invested in?
Rod Stewart?
Right, now,
it's been a long time,
but I do love a call sheet.
So if you could all be here
from 4:00 tomorrow,
then we'll run
sound check from 4:30,
and after that, we'll go
to the lighting cues.
Big day tomorrow, gents.
This girl has cleaned
her last floor.
Please, leave it.
You don't have to do that.
Oh, no, that's all right.
I'll just...
I'll just pop them inside.
I nicked it from
the tech guys.
Fancy a smoke?
Oh, no, I've...
I've got to go.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Can you roll it?
When I first met Sam,
we lived in this...
shittiest little flat
on Clydeside.
There was nothing there.
Not like it is now.
We had rats
because of the river.
We were broken into
nearly once a week.
But we had these really,
really amazing parties.
Don't really want this.
You have someone?
No, I'm free as a bird.
Lucky you.
You're young.
You're incredibly talented.
You're at the height
of your powers.
There is nothing
you can't do.
This is your time.
Once you got kids,
it's a little bit different.
Yeah.
I'd better go.
Hello!
- Hmm.
- How are you, honey?
I'm fine, thank you.
- I'll drop you home.
- Oh, no, no, you're all...
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll just take the bus.
- No, no, come on.
- No.
- Sleep well.
- Aye, yeah.
See you in the morning.
You homesick, aye?
Mm.
What, is this the one
where you try
and stick it up
the daily woman?
No, no.
This is the one
where I tell you
that I'm onto you.
I know you did the jail.
And I know
what you were in for.
Susannah's bought into
whatever it is you're selling,
and I'm not about to take that
away from her now.
But I don't want you
anywhere near my kids,
so, see, the morrow,
sing your song,
get your money,
then you're gone.
Lyle.
Hurry up.
Haven't got all day.
Rosie.
Where you been, man?
Havenae seen
hide nor hair of you.
All right, wee man?
I'll be in in a minute.
- Do you want a drink?
- No.
- You all right, pal?
- Aye, you know, I'm brand-new.
Looking for something.
- Lyle!
- Mum!
His name's Lyle.
He's five.
He swung on a wardrobe
and then the wardrobe
fell on him.
I think it's just his arms
that he's hurt
but maybe his head as well.
Okay, Lyle, do you mind
if I have a wee look?
Ow!
- All right.
- It's okay.
She's gonna have a wee look,
okay?
- Any allergies?
- No, I don't... I don't...
- I don't think so, no.
- Fabric plasters.
Okay, um, we'll need
to X-ray him.
It's one of those nights
in here tonight,
so it might be a while
until a doctor sees youse.
- Okay?
- I want my granny.
Please, I want my granny.
- Please.
- It's okay. It's okay.
I want my granny.
My next pill?
Water?
Thanks.
- Are you Lyle's mum?
- Aye, yeah.
- Dr. Yousaf.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry about the wait.
- No.
The X-ray looks
fairly straightforward,
but he'll need a cast.
When can we go home?
We can't get the cast on
until the swelling's come down,
so we are looking
at a couple more hours.
I'm sorry it's been
such a long night.
Fucking hell.
- Where is he?
- He's still asleep.
Right, I'll take
this one home,
and you can stay here
with the wee fella.
No.
No.
What's for you
will no go by you.
Maybe 20 year in the baker's
is enough for you,
but it's not enough for me.
Away and get me a wee cup
of tea, darling.
What's the matter with you?
I just... I just need you
to help... help me.
Help you?
Help you do what?
Leave him here
while you go to a party?
Is that the plan?
I don't know what this
awffy-toffee woman
thinks you are,
but she wouldn't give you
a brass farthing
if she knew the truth.
You haven't even told her,
have you?
She doesn't even have a clue
that you've got kids.
If you're no even prepared
to acknowledge their existence,
there's no hope for you.
And there's sure as hell
none for them.
Go.
Go to Nashville.
Do whatever it is
you want to do.
Come on, darling.
Let's go see your wee brother.
- Have you been to sleep?
- No.
- Not at all?
- No.
 Well, I only came
into this bar 
 To hear a sad song 
 But I'll probably be here
all night long 
 The way I'm feeling now 
 I couldn't get you
on the phone 
 So I let it ring 
 On and on 
 In a lonesome serenade 
 Ooh 
 What am I gonna do
about my problems now? 
 Maybe I should try
to find a way 
 To kinda sorta maybe
work it out 
Rose-Lynn!
Where have you been?
Jesus Christ.
I thought you were a no-show.
The band have had
to talk me off a ledge.
You look tired.
You all right?
Aye, yeah, aye.
Yeah, I'm brand-new.
- I'm great.
- Oh, good, good, good.
Come on, let's go.
You gave me such a fright.
 And a double barrel
whiskey 
Okay, um, so...
not long ago,
a spark of light
flew in through my door
and reminded me
of why I fell in love with
Glasgow in the first place.
The girl, like the city,
is gallus...
She's funny,
and above all else,
she's completely fearless.
And with your help,
she's going to Nashville
to do what she was put
on this Earth to do.
I'm so proud to know her
and call her my friend.
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together
for Rose-Lynn Harlan!
Okay, let's go.
So... s-sorry,
can you just give me...
give me... give me five?
Rose-Lynn.
Hey.
Hey!
Rose-Lynn.
Please, what's going on?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
What's happened?
Oh, darling.
Come on.
I don't know what... what you
see when you look at me,
but it isnae me.
What are you talking about?
I'm not at the height
of my powers.
I'm not free,
and there's so, so much
I can't undo.
I can't undo
going to the jail.
I can't undo chucking in heroin
to all they lassies in there
already fucked for drugs.
And do you know what else
I cannae undo?
Having two kids.
Two beautiful children
before I was 18.
Wynonna, she's eight.
And Lyle, he's five.
And I...
I got 12 months in the jail
and I... I left behind two kids.
Yep.
That's the truth.
Not this.
That.
Them.
Everything I made you
think I am,
I'm not.
Sorry, I'm just...
Come on.
I see an island over there.
Island?
- Is that a clam?
- Do you think you can open it?
Miss Harlan?
What I'm gonna do, um,
and that... I mean,
I... I... I'll be happy
just mucking in.
I've got...
- Bye.
- Okay.
 Happy birthday
to you 
- Hooray!
- Yay!
Did you make a wish?
You can have mine.
Right, who's having
the first slice, eh?
- Me.
- Yeah?
Good.
It's only me.
Aye.
Aye?
Have you got a wee minute?
Aye, yeah.
You already gave me something.
What's this for?
Why are you giving me this?
I wanted you to take
responsibility.
But I never meant
to take away your hope.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Maybe there is more to life.
Maybe there... there isn't.
I don't know.
I've never been farther
than Dunoon.
But you need to away and see.
No.
I can't start
all that up again.
It's finished.
I always said
I'd go to college,
if I hadnae had to go
out to work at 15.
And I would have.
I wanted to be a pharmacist.
The thing is...
What was stopping me,
you know?
Even after I had you,
I could have gone.
But I think it was just easier
for me to...
to want things for you
than to go after them
for myself.
I hadn't the gumption.
That's the truth.
But you...
you do.
I'll look after the kids.
You go.
You see what's waiting for you.
Where'd you get
all this money from?
Amazing what you can do,
20 year in the baker's.
 Don't be afraid
to graze your knees 
 Jump over the fences,
climb up trees 
 Folk, they will say
 Don't fly too high 
 But put on those wings
and reach for the sky 
 And it's all right
to be all wrong 
 You've got to be weak
if you wanna be strong 
 So dance your own dance,
sing your own song 
 And live the life
you dreamed of 
 Till the dreamer is gone 
Right.
There you go.
Thanks very much.
Yep, all right.
Have a great stay.
Thank you.
How long you in town?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, I just...
well, it depends what happens,
you know, so...
Well, I wish you what I wish
all y'all who come here:
may all your heartbreaks
be songs
- and all your songs be hits.
- Thanks.
Third door on the left.
Whoo!
 Roll it and tipped in
box upon box 
 Well, it's five o'clock
freedom 
 And the whistle would blow 
 Gates would burst open,
the river would flow 
 Lit up like matches
to the dance halls 
 It's high time 
- Sorry. Excuse me.
-  Been missing my roots 
Ma'am.
 I'm getting rid
of the flash 
 Nobody needs
a thousand-dollar suit 
 Just to take out the trash 
 Ain't gotta be alone 
How do you get to sing?
You gotta go through
our booker.
There's a wait list.
It's all on the website.
But what if I'm only here
for a while?
I mean, there's people here
from all over.
From Australia,
New Zealand, Germany.
We're all trying
to do the same thing.
You know, it's Nashville.
It's a company town.
So eventually you're gonna meet
someone who knows somebody
who works someplace
who can help you out.
- Can I get you something?
- No, no, I'm fine. Fine.
 Fine time 
 To let it all go,
I've been too low 
 So it's high time 
Welcome to the Ryman,
the mother church
of country music.
This is the exact spot
where bluegrass was born
and where Johnny Cash
met June Carter.
Now, it was right here
that country music
found an audience
beyond its own back porch
and countless careers took off.
Now, when the Grand Ole Opry
put down roots here in 1943,
the live radio and TV show
brought the likes
of Elvis Presley,
Hank Williams,
Johnny Cash,
Marty Robbins,
Minnie Pearl,
Patsy Cline,
and Roy Acuff to the stage
and into living rooms
all around America.
Now...
 When I reach 
 The place I'm goin' 
 I will surely know my way 
 And I will turn 
 And look inside me 
 And bid farewell 
 To one more day 
 I will fly 
 Beyond this valley 
 I will open up 
 The gates 
 And when I reach 
 The place I'm goin' 
 I will surely 
 Know my way 
 I was born 
 Without a whisper 
 I was born 
 Beneath the rain 
 And when I reach 
 The place I'm going 
 I will surely 
 Know my way 
You would not believe
how many people do that.
On a tour,
give ole Wyatt the slip,
get up there and sing
a whole damn song.
Aye, I thought that
wee Disney prick
was gonna call the polis.
I have no idea
what you just said.
But, look, I'm getting drinks
a week from Saturday
with my buddy Laurel.
She's some kind of deal
out there at Curb Records.
So if you wanted to meet her,
you could come
by the restaurant.
No.
No, thanks, but... I'm away.
 And when I reach
the place I'm goin' 
 I will surely know my way 
- Quitting already?
- No.
No, I'm just kicking off.
To the airport, please.
 We have hands
to hold our sorrow 
 We have tears
to heal the pain 
 And though your eyes
ask many questions 
 On your lips,
I hear my name 
 I was born
without a whisper 
 I was born
beneath the rain 
 But when I reach
the place I'm goin' 
 I will surely know my way 
 I will surely 
 Know my way 
Mum!
Oh.
Oh, God, look at you.
Eh?
Look at you.
- Mum, you're back!
- I'm back!
I'm back!
Did you miss me?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
How much?
10 million?
Yeah.
Have youse been looking
after your granny for me?
Uh, as you can hear,
I'm not from Nashville.
I'm from right here
in Glasgow!
Whoo!
Uh, well this is, uh,
a tune that I wrote.
Um...
You'll be lucky if you get
three chords out of me,
honest to God.
Anyway, I'll give it a go.
 I've worn out the stones 
 In front of your doorstep 
 Coming and going,
coming and going 
 You left the lights on 
 I always knew that 
 I should have
said thank you 
 A thousand miles ago 
 But I pushed you away 
 Put a pin in a map 
 Then I got lost
in the storm 
 Had to find my own way 
 Make my own mistakes 
 But you know
that I had to go 
 Ain't no yellow brick road 
 Running through Glasgow 
 But I found one
that's stronger than stone 
 Ain't no place like home 
 Ain't no place 
 Like home 
 Moon hanging low 
 Over my window 
 Shoebox of dreams 
 Hid under my bed 
 Follow the bright lights 
 City of gold 
 I had to leave to realize 
 All I needed was here 
 Mama, we both know
that there's nothing 
 That a little time
and Patsy Cline wouldn't fix 
 Had to find my own way 
 Make my own mistakes 
 But you know
that I had to go 
 Ain't no yellow brick road 
 Running through Glasgow 
 But I found one
that's stronger than stone 
 Ain't no place like home 
 Ain't no place 
 Like home 
 I'll just click my heels 
 Three more times 
 There it all is 
 What's always been mine 
 Ain't no yellow brick road 
 Running through Glasgow 
 But I found one
that's stronger than stone 
 Ain't no place 
 Like home 
 Ain't no place like home 
 Ain't no place 
 Like home 
 Ain't no place like home 
 Ain't no place like home 
 Ain't no place like home 
Whoo!
 He wore a Texas tuxedo 
 She wore Cadillac green 
 They went together like
a match and gasoline 
 Big Davey Cameron
from the abattoir 
 And Annie O'Malley
works the Laurieston Bar 
 4,000 miles east
of Tennessee 
 Paisley Road West
is the place to be 
 He was the king
of the cowboys 
 Stealing the night 
 She was the queen
of Memphis 
 Robbing the bank of life 
 Whoa, robbing
the bank of life 
 Two shots of whisky
and an Irn-Bru 
 Hands up 
 No one move 
 King of the cowboys 
 Stealing the night 
 Queen of Memphis 
 Robbing the bank of life 
 King of the cowboys 
 Stealing the night 
 Queen of Memphis 
 Robbing the bank of life 
 Robbing the bank
of life 
 Mm-mm, mm 
 Mm-mm, mm 
 Wear this, don't wear that 
 Don't step out of place 
 Just smile,
don't say too much 
 Put that makeup
on your face 
 Just keep pretending
you're having a good time 
 'Cause that's
the price of fame 
 And you're standing
in the line 
 That's the view from here 
 That's the view
from here 
 It's like
champagne and tears 
 When all you want's a beer 
 Keep your loved ones near 
 Oh, keep
your loved ones near 
 'Cause famous folk
are weird 
 That's the view from here 
 Hey 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Mm-mm, mm 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Mm-mm, mm 
 That's the view from here 
 Oh, that's the view
from here 
 It's like
champagne and tears 
 When all you want's a beer 
 Keep your loved ones near 
 Oh, keep
your loved ones near 
 'Cause famous folk
are weird 
 That's the view 
 From here
