 - Good morning.
 What's the mother's name?
 - Good morning.
 What's the mother's name?
 Erna Sveinsdottir.
 - Hold on.
 PARENTS
 Are you having it like that?
 - Isn't it cute?
 No,
 let's skip the candy.
 It's nice as it is.
 The guests will arrive soon.
 Mom, are you trying to kill me?
 This is really uncomfortable.
 Baldur!
 What are you saying child?
 It's just for today.
 Sit down and take a load off.
 Grandma's going to
 get you something special.
 Listen Baldur,
 I was thinking-
 This is from grandma.
 Wait, wait...
 There you go.
 Happy birthday to you.
 Happy birthday to you.
 Happy birthday dear Baldur.
 Happy birthday to you.
 Listen Baldur,
 I...
 I ordered mine from abroad,
 but it hasn't arrived yet.
 Is that okay?
 - Sure.
 Great...
 I'll help you blow out
 the candles later.
 That's a lot of candles, huh?
 - There are eleven candles!
 - Don't touch
 the icing Baldur!
 Wait, not just yet.
 I forgot the camera.
 Katrin dear,
 come take a picture.
 - You should take the picture,
 "The Family Photographer".
 There you go dear.
 Just push the 'on' button.
 Push until the focus is clear,
 then you push...
 Push again, but you have to
 wait for the focus.
 How's is it going abroad?
 - Just great.
 It demands
 a lot of my time.
 Thank you.
 It's great to see you guys.
 - You too. You look great.
 Thanks.
 - How's Sweden these days?
 - Same as always.
 I've been there so long.
 Katrin...
 Yes, right.
 What?
 For me?
 Hi?
 - Katrin, Katrin..!
 Johan?
 - You fucking cunt!
 I... I can explain-
 - I stand here waiting for you.
 Yes, sorry. I can explain.
 It's my son's birthday.
 - What the hell
 is wrong with you!
 I have to be here-
 - You fucking cunt!
 I'm sorry, so sorry.
 - Fuck.
 - I trusted you to return,
 but you have betrayed me!
 No, I haven't-
 - You have betrayed me!
 - You have betrayed me!
 Understand?!
 - I go to the airport
 and you don't show up!
 I'm sorry, I meant to call.
 - You whore!
 I...
 There you are!
 You have to say goodbye.
 - I'm coming.
 The guests are leaving.
 Simmi and Pala are waiting
 to say goodbye to you.
 Come on then.
 - Yes.
 - Hear what I'm saying!
 Johan,
 can I call you back-
 - You take the next plane
 to Stockholm, understand?
 I can't do that.
 - You will come tomorrow.
 - Understand! Tomorrow!
 - I can't come tomorrow.
 - This is the last time
 I'll wait for you.
 - Do you understand?
 - The last time!
 - Am I making myself clear?
 - Yes... Yes, I understand.
 - Say: I'll come tomorrow Johan.Say it!
 - Say it!
 - Johan... I'll come tomorrow.
 - Breathe in...
 And now we're flying.
 - We're flying as a group.
 - The young in the middle
 and the strong keep point.
 - Elvar, I need to use
 the bathroom.
 It's me.
 - Oskar? I really need to go.
 Use the one downstairs.
 - Mom is in the shower.
 This one's occupied.
 Just, go outside or something.
 - What's wrong with you?
 Oskar, can you pick me up
 after gymnastics?
 When are you done?
 - About five o'clock.
 Sure, I'll be there.
 Mom, can I get
 a new swimsuit?
 Swimsuit? Isn't the one
 you have good enough?
 No, it's ugly.
 - Don't be silly. It looks great.
 Mom?!
 - Not now.
 You can, when we go
 to Italy next summer.
 This one will do for now.
 End of discussion.
 Can you do a somersault?
 Learnt that in gymnastics?
 Yeah.
 - Really?
 You should have
 seen her the other day.
 I couldn't make it.
 - That's okay.
 They're happy with
 the current terms.
 Yes.
 I told them
 it was binding, so...
 We need to get it
 in writing.
 No later than
 tomorrow.
 Hey. Twelve grand
 on one hand.
 On just one hand.
 - Yes... Exactly.
 Well...
 Are you going to
 show dad your drawing?
 Want to put your jacket on?
 - I'm so tired.
 I think your dad
 is on his way.
 - It's on the top shelf.
 Do you see it?
 Bottom of the heap.
 Nine- thirty...
 You have to be there.
 Gauti doesn't know anything.
 I won't worry about it then.
 Bye.
 Do we need to go to grandma?
 - Yeah, come on.
 You're a bit late.
 - Yes, couldn't make it sooner.
 This happens a bit too often.
 - What?
 That you arrive late.
 Yeah,
 I was busy at work.
 I should be busy too.
 - Yes, but you work here, right?
 Yes, but we're closed now.
 I'm here on my spare time.
 Okay.
 It can't go on like this.
 It's not an option for parents
 to be repeatedly late.
 Not an option?
 Okay.
 - Fine by me.
 Hello!
 Welcome.
 I'll just pick her up
 Monday morning.
 First thing.
 - Einar?
 What's going on
 with you?
 I'm not-
 - Halla called me.
 And what?
 - What are you thinking?
 This isn't your problem.
 She needs a little space,
 A little time to
 get her head straight.
 Everything will be okay.
 Don't get involved!
 It's none of your business.
 Seriously.
 Can you take care of
 the girl over the weekend?
 Of course I can honey,
 you know that.
 That's what I need,
 Okay?
 People are waiting for me
 at work. See you later.
 All right dear.
 - Bye.
 Oskar Sveinn?
 Do you have the...
 Yeah...
 Thanks.
 - Sorry!
 Dear Lord, that was clumsy.
 No, it was my fault.
 - I'm sorry.
 Do you have something
 to clean this up with?
 Of course.
 Excuse me.
 I'm so terribly clumsy.
 - I'll do it.
 This is so embarrassing.
 It's my entire fault.
 It wasn't your fault.
 I'll bring
 a new one tomorrow.
 That'll be no trouble.
 Can I borrow that?
 - Yeah.
 Listen...
 If you want to
 get it over with today...
 Then...
 I'll take that.
 You can have privacy,
 in the bathroom there.
 - That is, if you want
 to finish this today?
 Yes, I'll do it now.
 Do you have a new container?
 Certainly.
 Good morning.
 Morning, how do you do?
 You're the new one?
 Yes. Katrin Rose.
 - I'm Oskar Sveinn.
 I'm the other dentist.
 - Right...
 Orn told me you might
 start today, I just forgot.
 How's it going?
 Getting into swing of things?
 Yeah, it's going great.
 - Good.
 Listen, I feel like
 I know you from somewhere?
 Do you recognize me?
 Are you a former patient?
 - No...
 Are you from Hunavatn County?
 - No no.
 Okay, sorry about that.
 - Hi!
 - Hi! You are early.
 Is is Arnor?
 - Yes.
 - Hi.
 - My, how you've grown!
 - Take a seat for a minute.
 I need to prepare.
 Won't take a second.
 - No problem.
 Do they call you dad yet?
 - They don't have to.
 Sure.
 I was just curious.
 They're so grown now.
 They meet their dad regularly,
 don't they?
 Of course.
 - From time to time.
 - No plans on having
 one of your own?
 Well,
 who knows.
 - Johan.
 - Hi, hi.
 Did I wake you?
 Sorry, I didn't mean to.
 - Who is this?
 Sorry... What?
 - Who is this?
 This is Katrin.
 - What do you want?
 I...
 I need to tell you something.
 I have decided...
 I've decided
 to stay in Iceland.
 I think it's best that I
 take care of my son and...
 Johan?
 - Think I'm just
 waiting for you?
 - I don't need you.
 No?
 - Stay in Iceland.
 I can get any woman I want.
 - Do you think you mean
 so much to me?
 No, I'm not saying that.
 I just thought-
 - Right.
 - Just do
 what you will.
 Trunk's out!
 Everyone's there, the principal,
 his wife next to him.
 Guy was expelled on the spot!
 We had a guy that was always
 hanging around our team.
 We duped him into
 being a sort of a "helper".
 We made him do
 "The Elephant"-
 A Sidekick.
 - Yeah, a Sidekick.
 And as he was
 pulling his thing out
 someone had a camera
 and took a picture of-
 Isn't that you wife?
 Yeah...
 The guy was sort of...
 His name was Orvar-
 Aren't you going to talk to her?
 - Yeah... In a moment.
 Can you order me a coffee?
 Sure. A double Espresso?
 - Yes.
 The grammar's hard so...
 - I think you're doing great.
 Thank you.
 Hi.
 - Hi.
 How's everything?
 - Good, I'm in a meeting Einar.
 A meeting? For what?
 - Work.
 Hi.
 - I'm John.
 I'm Einar,
 her husband.
 Don't you need papers
 if you are having a meeting?
 Einar, this is a meeting.
 - Why here?
 Why not here?
 - I'm always here for lunch.
 Oh come on, Einar I-
 Don't tell me you did
 come here on purpose?
 What's wrong with you?
 - Just admit it!
 You knew I'd be here
 having lunch.
 Einar, no!
 Don't act this way.
 What do you do?
 - I direct...commercials.
 You're not Icelandic?
 - No, I'm from Ireland.
 Ireland? OK.
 Don't let me interrupt,
 just continue.
 I'm just checking up on you-
 - I can see that you are-
 You knew I'd come over, right?
 - Of course not, I-
 You knew
 I'd be here!
 Don't pretend
 you didn't know.
 Einar, would you stop this-
 - What's this bullshit?!
 This isn't a meeting.
 Where did you find this guy?
 Coffee?
 Why don't you get Irish coffee?
 Aren't you Irish?
 Einar, don't!
 - You knew I'd be here!
 That's why you are here!
 Why are you provoking me?
 - Why don't we talk,
 instead of this provocation?!
 You knew I'd be here!
 You could have called!
 I wait by the phone
 weeks on end.
 Why can't you just call?!
 Would you please stop!
 - Why are you doing this?!
 - Not so loudly!
 Don't dare provoke me!
 Do you hear?
 One phone call!
 Kids!
 - Yes?
 Don't play on the street.
 - You can pass by us.
 You should be
 at the playground.
 It's so boring there.
 You shouldn't play here.
 - Just drive past us.
 Hello?
 - Hi there.
 The designer stopped by
 to check out the bathroom.
 He said the tiles would
 be in on Monday.
 Then we can get
 the ball rolling.
 - Great.
 I decided on
 the lighter color.
 I trust you implicitly.
 What's the occasion?
 I thought we'd have some
 Champagne. It's five o'clock.
 What..?
 I just got some test results.
 - Is everything okay?
 - Everything is terrific.
 I've got...
 great sperm.
 Great.
 Congratulations.
 I have incredible virile
 and vivacious semen.
 Great.
 - In no way sluggish.
 And because of that
 I wanted to celebrate.
 I'm not drinking now.
 - Why not?
 I have to pick up Elvar.
 And I have work tonight.
 Oh?
 That's too bad.
 We're just too tense, Oskar.
 And I'm too old.
 I'm not tense.
 And you're
 not too old.
 Are we trying to
 have a baby together, or?
 Yes, we are.
 Wouldn't it be clever
 if you'd have some tests done?
 I already have Oskar.
 I'm fine!
 We're just getting too old.
 - No we're not. We're young.
 Okay, I'll go and have
 another checkup, okay?
 I'm going to pick Elvar up.
 That's a foul, referee!
 Are you asleep?
 - Put on your glasses!
 You were great, the best!
 I'll wait by the car, dear.
 I think it'd be best if
 Baldur came to live with me.
 It's time to
 take that step, mom.
 You and Baldur?
 - Yes.
 Don't you think
 he's suffered enough?
 Are you going to
 uproot him now,
 when there's finally
 some balance in his life?
 "Come home,
 I miss you."
 It's been four years
 since your last checkup?
 Yeah...
 Maybe not four exactly-
 Aren't you notified
 every six months?
 Yeah,
 but they call...
 Why don't you show up
 when you get a call?
 This look awful,
 holes everywhere.
 - You should floss.
 - Yes...
 You have to floss.
 - I'm off then.
 All right. Bye.
 I've tried flossing, but...
 Listen...
 It hurts when I floss.
 And it bleeds.
 Should it bleed?
 - Baldur?
 Listen...
 I was thinking...
 If we'd move
 into a new place together?
 Just me and you?
 Then you could...
 You'd get
 your own room...
 And a new bed,
 maybe?
 No... Grandma
 would be all alone.
 I don't want that.
 Can't we just
 skip bowling?
 I want to go play soccer
 with my friends.
 I asked, what you wanted to do,
 and you said bowling?
 I'm trying here.
 Can't you just go
 back to Sweden?
 No...
 Why are you
 making this so difficult?
 Don't you like
 having me around?
 You know I'm your mom.
 I want to be your mom.
 Why are you
 acting this way?
 - Wait,
 don't go...
 - You're not right
 in the head!
 - You fuck up every time
 they visit you.
 - Yes, damn it!
 - You're just lucky I could
 pick them up at the airport.
 - And what about that woman,
 was she with you?
 - She's pregnant?
 - Oh, really,
 you always wanted more?
 - Fucking bullshit,
 you're lying through your teeth.
 - It was you
 and your family...
 that convinced me
 to get my tubes tied!
 - And I was stupid enough
 to listen to you fucking idiots!
 Is there a problem?
 No, just the same old story.
 Addi and the kids...
 He sent them home by plane...
 All alone.
 They're completely devastated,
 and I'm really upset.
 I think I'm going
 to go for a swim.
 - Get the hell out Oskar!
 - Hi.
 Hi.
 Where's Baldur?
 He's not here yet?
 I thought he was
 with you?
 He was acting
 a bit childish...
 He should be home
 soon enough.
 What do you mean, childish?
 Where is he?
 We went to the docks
 and he became a bit upset.
 The docks?
 - Yes.
 You left him at the docks?
 - No, I didn't. He ran away.
 Dear Lord...
 At the docks?!
 He could fall
 into the ocean.
 He's not used to
 being at the docks.
 You're a completely
 unfit mother!
 I'm an unfit mother?!
 - Yes, you-
 Are you completely senseless?
 Try to be a little helpful!
 I didn't leave my son.
 Do you think I'm insane?
 What's wrong with you?
 - What's wrong with me?
 Yes, you leave your son
 at the docks and...
 I didn't leave him there!
 Didn't you hear me?
 Yes, he ran away
 and then you come here-
 Yes!
 That means he's alone,
 wandering-
 I'm an unfit mother?
 What about you?
 Do you think you're
 The Perfect Mom?
 I'm considered a...
 Maybe not perfect.
 No one is perfect.
 But I've been considered
 a competent mom.
 That's what you think?
 God, how happy am I?
 See how bloody well
 you did with me?!
 It's not my fault that
 you're not happy now.
 You were happy as a child,
 got everything you asked for.
 Baldur!
 - Baldur, my dear Baldur!
 How did you get here?
 Did you take the bus?
 You hitched a ride?
 He hitched a ride!
 I heard.
 - You should never hitch a ride.
 It's very dangerous!
 - Aren't you cold?
 Who gave you a lift?
 - Some old lady.
 - Some old lady? Thank God.
 It was just
 one weekend!
 And you go
 and throw a party?
 Not a real party?
 What was then?
 Oh yes, yes it was.
 You were dead drunk!
 Elvar didn't sleep all night,
 he was so scared.
 Yes...yes...yes.
 No...No!
 Your son had
 a bad asthma fit.
 Hi.
 - Hi.
 Thanks for coming.
 - No problem.
 Are you okay?
 I've tried listening
 many times.
 She's the one
 who doesn't listen.
 Wait a minute.
 You know...
 There's your side of things.
 And then there's hers.
 Which is just as important
 as yours.
 You have to tell your side.
 And she has to tell hers.
 And you
 have to listen.
 You can also,
 you know...
 Use your daughter
 as leverage.
 Especially now when
 she's accusing you...
 Of not being there
 for the family.
 You can try, while
 she's thinking things over,
 to get close
 with your daughter.
 Then she'll see
 your nice side.
 If you connect better
 with your daughter... like...
 You can take her to...
 I don't know...
 Maybe buy her...
 A puppy or something...
 To make a point of...
 And that would mean,
 you know...
 Each time
 she sees that puppy...
 She'll think of you.
 And she'd see
 your new side.
 Yeah.
 - Get it?
 Howdy.
 Where's your car?
 - The car?
 I don't own one now.
 This is the real stuff.
 You bought this?
 - Yup, isn't it great?
 You're not driving
 the kids on that?
 On this? No.
 - Phew, for a moment there-
 No, no, that's too dangerous.
 It's just for me.
 A buddy of mine
 is on his way.
 He'll take the bike
 and I get his car.
 Shouldn't I just
 give them a lift?
 No, he's already
 on his way.
 He's probably lost
 or something
 Do you have
 some cash on you?
 I'm a bit short
 at the moment.
 Just to get me
 over the weekend?
 Just 'til I get paid?
 It's always the same
 with you, Addi?
 I have my ups
 and downs.
 I wanted to do
 something with the kids.
 - according to Matti Vanhanen,
 the Finnish Prime Minister.
 - Finland will lead the ESB
 from the 1st of July...
 Finland..?
 Finland!
 See what daddy brought you!
 Don't I get a kiss?
 Look at him,
 isn't he cute?
 Hi.
 - How are you?
 Did you just bring a cat?
 - Yes.
 Have you completely lost it?
 - What do you mean?
 What are you thinking?
 She's wanted a pet
 for such a long time.
 No, she hasn't.
 - Yes, she has.
 Yeah, he's cute!
 Einar, what's wrong with you?
 - What, come on.
 Miniature hamster?
 - Yes.
 You're putting me on!
 - No, I'm not!
 You're not allergic to cats.
 - Yes, I am!
 Since when?
 What's wrong with you
 Einar?
 Don't be this way.
 Can't she play with it today?
 I can pick it up
 later tonight.
 Allergic?
 - Katrin?
 I've got an awkward thing
 I need to get over with.
 I suddenly recalled where
 we've met before, and...
 I'm really sorry,
 I didn't remember.
 It's no problem.
 Yes, it is.
 To explain
 why I couldn't remember...
 Well...
 I was so drunk.
 Also, it's such
 a long time ago.
 About eleven years,
 Right?
 I'm not sure.
 - Right.
 Well, those parties
 can get crazy.
 It's why memories
 get a bit messed up.
 And Finland of course.
 Finland...
 Well anyway.
 I apologize.
 Bjarni is here.
 I'm going to
 grab an apple.
 You get him ready.
 I'll just be a minute.
 Bjarni?
 Come on in.
 Just take a seat.
 Can I put my jacket here?
 - Yes.
 Do you think he'll fix all
 the holes now, or just one?
 I have this presentation
 later at work, you see.
 It would be bad if
 my whole mouth was numb.
 If the tongue was...
 It's an important presentation.
 So it'd be best if
 he'd do just one now.
 I could come back
 for the rest.
 I won't feel a thing will I?
 - No.
 There'll be no pain?
 ...What's that?
 It's just a cover to go
 over the tooth. Open up.
 Keep still...
 There.
 - What are you doing?!
 There is blood everywhere?!
 What happened?
 - Did you cut my tongue?
 My god!
 This is like a slaughterhouse!
 Are you spastic or something?
 Let me take a look.
 - What is this place?!
 She cut off my tongue!
 - No, of course not.
 What happened?
 - I'm so sorry.
 Can I go?
 Can I go?
 - Did I upset you?
 May I leave?
 - Of course.
 Are you okay?
 - I'm so sorry.
 Hello.
 Katrin!
 - Hi.
 I had to come...
 - Yes.
 I've longed to see you.
 - Yes, me too.
 You look really good.
 Why haven't you...
 Why haven't you told
 your mother about us?
 I'll just leave
 you two alone.
 Thanks mom.
 Johan,
 you can't be here.
 You can't come here!
 - But I was so worried.
 Yes, but you have to leave.
 - What's this?
 Johan,
 you have to leave.
 Please do that, for me.
 I have to speak to my mom.
 I was so worried...
 Are you angry with me?
 No, I'm not angry.
 I promise...
 Have I done wrong?
 - No...No.
 Sure?
 - Yes, but you have to leave.
 I brought you something.
 - What?
 No, Johan...
 We can catch up later...
 Johan?
 Can we meet later tonight?
 - See here, see.
 Try it on.
 - I don't want to!
 Try it.
 - But...
 Do you like it?
 - Yes.
 Listen...
 Can we talk later?
 Shall I go?
 - Please.
 We'll talk tonight.
 I can't right now.
 Tonight.
 I understand.
 - Thank you.
 I'm very grateful.
 Hello?
 What's wrong?
 You're late.
 Late?
 You promised to
 pick me up from school.
 Dad?
 Don't you know me?
 It's me, Oskar.
 Your son.
 Yes...
 Dad?
 - Yes?
 Should we go for a walk?
 Get some fresh air.
 Where are your shoes?
 - Somewhere around.
 I...
 I just don't know
 what to do...
 Dad?
 It was never this way
 with you and mom, was it?
 There are so
 many things...
 Our heavenly father's
 gentle hand.
 Shall lead us through
 this troubled land.
 He comforts those
 whose hearts are sad.
 Tormented souls.
 Good or bad.
 O father though
 you do as you please
 We pray you will
 our troubles ease
 and give our souls...
 your heavenly peace.
 Baldur!
 Hi!
 Where's grandma?
 Grandma is a bit busy
 so I'm here to pick you up.
 Jump in.
 Fun in school today?
 What did you do?
 This and that...
 Why do you have
 suitcases?
 Are you leaving?
 Well. I...
 I've got a
 surprise for you.
 Do you like
 amusement parks?
 Yes?
 But have you been to
 the one in Copenhagen?
 No.
 I was thinking...
 of inviting you.
 Today...
 to Copenhagen!
 Just the two of us.
 We'll have a great time
 There are a lot of
 cool rides.
 Like the one, that-
 - Can you stop the car?
 Seriously, there's one
 that goes straight down-
 Stop the car!
 Stop the car!
 - Let's talk about this.
 Baldur?!
 Baldur,
 come back!
 Sorry!
 We don't have to...
 We don't have to go!
 Come back.
 Please!
 I'll drive you home.
 What was that procedure
 your ex made you have?
 What do you mean?
 When you were arguing
 on the phone.
 You said...
 You had "your tubes tied"?
 Is it true?
 Oskar,
 I...
 You have to
 understand...
 I was young,
 I didn't know...
 Why the hell
 didn't you tell me?!
 I was afraid.
 Afraid of what? Me?
 - Oskar, listen to me!
 Sure, I'm listening.
 I was fearful
 that...
 Look-
 - Oskar, listen to me!
 I was afraid...
 You'd leave me if you knew.
 This is a huge breach of trust.
 Do you understand?
 You let me think
 all this time...
 that we can have
 a child together.
 I don't like this
 at all!
 Maybe they can
 fix it?
 Yes!
 I'm certain of it.
 Oskar...
 Doctors today
 can do miracles.
 - Listen to me!
 Doctors can...
 - I can't ever have children!
 They took away
 my ovaries.
 - Now you know.
 - I'm sorry.
 Listen honey...
 We'll go out to dinner.
 Everything will be fine.
 Let's just relax...
 Forget about-
 - What's wrong with you?
 - Aren't you even angry?
 I've lied to you for years
 and you're not even angry?
 I never know where
 I've got you!
 I'm furious!
 I want to smash everything.
 I'm incredibly angry...
 and disappointed!
 But I'm going to
 control myself.
 I want to enjoy life,
 with you...
 We'll go out,
 together
 and everything
 will be fine!
 I'll see you later
 honey.
 Bye.
 Hi.
 How are you?
 Oh, I'm fine.
 Papers..?
 What papers?
 Without...
 You know...
 Without talking to me first?
 I just thought...
 I didn't realise
 we were at that stage...
 Signing some papers?
 Well, you could've
 called me.
 The phone is always on.
 Well, I&
 I'm not coming home
 to sign any divorce papers.
 That's for damn sure!
 I just don't
 agree with you...
 If you want to meet with me,
 you can come over.
 I'm staying at...
 Hotel Iceland.
 Yes, I am!
 Yes, hang on...
 Out, get out.
 What?
 No,
 just someone asking...
 I'm busy at the office
 as usual.
 Like I said...
 If you want to meet
 you can come over.
 I'm still at work,
 I have to finish up here.
 I'll be at the hotel around ten.
 Room number 203.
 Can I offer you something?
 - No, I'm good.
 What's this
 Cocos Parfait?
 - Cocos Parfait?
 It's a fromage.
 - With dried fruits,
 strawberries and blueberries.
 And this, number 25?
 - Vanilla and Chocolate souffle?
 - It's a warm
 chocolate mousse.
 It's French.
 What do you recommend?
 - Cocos Parfait.
 Is that good?
 - Yes, very good.
 I'll have one of those.
 What about you Oskar?
 What are you having?
 What are you-
 - Nothing, nothing for me.
 Yes, coffee and Cognac!
 - Any special brand?
 Just, surprise me.
 That would be great.
 Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 I was thinking.
 You know...
 What we've been
 talking about.
 Know what?
 These days, women can...
 ...get help.
 You know.
 Science has progressed
 so much that...
 We could get
 a donor egg.
 If we would get one...
 I could fertilize it...
 with my stuff.
 Then you would carry it...
 In your womb
 for nine months.
 And it would be ours.
 Where would you get one?
 At the supermarket?
 No, not at the supermarket.
 I don't know...
 Sonja, for example,
 your daughter.
 - She could donate
 an egg.
 Genetically speaking...
 She's your flesh and blood.
 You can't be serious?!
 She's sexually mature, right?
 Isn't she?
 She must be, you know,
 girls mature much sooner.
 - So then...
 I'd be the baby's
 mother and grandmother?
 Yeah...
 - Realise what you are saying?
 Yes, sorry.
 Forget I said it.
 Sorry, I just...
 It was just the first thing
 that came to mind.
 I'm sorry.
 But...
 One of your friends.
 They could give you one?
 This is crazy talk.
 You're obsessed!
 Alright, okay...
 You just don't want
 to have my baby, that's it-
 Thanks...
 Thanks for coming.
 I couldn't talk at home.
 You have to understand,
 the situation is complicated.
 My mother, she's so damn-
 No, I don't want...
 Thanks.
 - You don't want one?
 No, thanks.
 It's like I said-
 I've been
 thinking things over.
 And I understand
 how you feel.
 I can change.
 I know I've made promises
 but this time it's for real.
 I'll change, I swear I will.
 - Yes, but it doesn't-
 I promise. Things will get
 so much better.
 No, it's-
 - Much better.
 Wait...
 I love you.
 I love you.
 Hi.
 - Hi.
 Come on in.
 Come in.
 I found a bottle
 of red wine.
 Do you want a glass?
 - No thanks, I'm driving.
 Well, what's up?
 Have you been here
 for two months Einar?
 That sounds about right,
 two months.
 It's a pretty long time.
 - It's no home.
 You've got to get
 some help, Einar.
 Staying here
 like some fool.
 We're all worried
 about you.
 Maybe I'm worried
 about you.
 Maybe you need
 to get some help?
 No, please...
 I admit
 I have my faults.
 But so do you.
 .
 I am...
 These are the papers.
 Einar, you need to sign them.
 I'm thinking...
 it would be best
 if I'd decide this.
 I... I don't think this is
 something you really want
 and that you're doing it
 out of pure stubbornness.
 Einar, you don't function
 in a normal household.
 That's just bullshit
 and you know it.
 Don't drag up this crap.
 Not here, not to me.
 Are you sure you don't want
 a glass of wine? We can talk-
 - No thanks.
 It would be good if you
 would give me a moment.
 Just have a seat,
 and a glass of wine.
 I will set you straight
 within thirty minutes.
 Well, the papers
 are on the table...
 I'll have someone
 fetch them for me.
 Don't be this way.
 Halla, please stop!
 Please don't do this!
 Don't leave me.
 I'm hopeless
 without you.
 I understand you want a child.
 All women do.
 It's the mothers's instinct.
 I don't want
 you to be sad.
 I really don't.
 You're strong and look nice.
 It's like you said, you can
 get any woman you want.
 You have money
 and a fantastic apartment-
 Blow me.
 Can I get you anything?
 - Sorry?
 Can I bring you
 something?
 Sparkling water.
 Blow me!
 Or, should I
 ask you mother to do it?
 Piece of shit!
 So, Mr.Shit...
 Champagne?
 I think it's time
 you went to bed.
 Why?
 Let's talk a bit.
 I'm off to bed.
 - Erna!
 Erna?
 Talk to me.
 We have to
 communicate more.
 I need to
 tell you things...
 From back in the days...
 You're absolutely right!
 - This is excellent
 Champagne!
 - I'll drink by myself,
 then.
 Here you go.
 Enjoy.
 Hello?
 - Hello.
 Do you have an appointment?
 - No, just looking for my mom.
 What's her name?
 Katrin Rose.
 She's your mom?
 - Yes.
 I haven't seen her
 all day.
 Oh...
 Hey champ?
 What's your name?
 - Baldur.
 When did you last see her?
 - Last night.
 Last night?
 Were you up late?
 No, I just woke up
 when she was leaving.
 You don't know
 where she was going?
 Maybe she went
 on a short trip?
 Well...
 She had a suitcase.
 Do you have an uncle or
 an aunt in the countryside?
 Yes.
 Maybe she's visiting family?
 Could that be the case?
 Then she would have
 told me.
 Yes. It's weird.
 Are you feeling sad?
 - No. What's that?
 It's a kind of a...
 ...Television.
 Shall I show you?
 Have a seat.
 Do you go to a dentist?
 - Yes.
 Have you seen one of these?
 - Yes.
 Know what it is?
 - No.
 It's a...
 Camera.
 It takes x- rays.
 And afterwards...
 I see the pictures
 up there.
 Then I can show the patients
 how their teeth look.
 I could also
 show them movies.
 If I had any.
 But I don't.
 What school do you go to?
 - Fellaschool.
 And which school
 did you go to in Sweden?
 I didn't go to school
 in Sweden.
 Oh..?
 Were you just slacking?
 No?
 Oh, you mean,
 when mom went to Sweden?
 I didn't go with her.
 I stayed with grandma.
 Is that so?
 But what about your dad?
 - I don't know.
 I kind of don't know
 anything about him.
 So it goes sometimes.
