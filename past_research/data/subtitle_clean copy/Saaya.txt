Your eyes...
my eyes
Your forehead...
your nose
Your lips
My heart, your brains
No... not your brains.
You´re a duffer
All right. Your heart.
And your brains. Okay?
Listen...
What?
What will we name our son?
Son?
No son, l want a daughter.
Why?
Just like you
But l want sons
after that, okay?
Want to know how many?
Let´s settle for a dozen
Twelve!
My companion...
my love...
for the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?
you have stolen my heart,
my love
For the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?
you have stolen my heart,
my love
l was thirsty at heart...
and l drank the sea
in a single gulp
ln just a matter of moments...
in just a day or two...
l have lived the lifetime
of a hundred years
This is the first time l see
life so clearly...
the lovely weather,
this moment of ecstasy...
what spell has the
weather cast on me?
You have stolen my heart, my love
Maya...
What happened, Maya?
l´m afraid...
what if something happens to you?
To me...? Silly girl.
What´s going to happen to me?
No power on earth
can separate us
Roses, l saw blossoming...
but even thorns blossom today
People, l saw meeting...
l see the earth and the skies
meeting today
For the first time,
l have begun to trust my life...
This lovely weather,
this ecstatic moment...
what spell has the
weather cast...?
You have stolen my heart, my love
For the first time,
my eyes see Spring like this
What spell does
the lovely weather cast...?
you have stolen my heart,
my love
This is Dr Akash Bhatnagar.
My wife is trapped in the floods
lt´s your duty to...
We can´t do anything about it
We really don´t have
any transport
There are landslides everywhere
out there
But you can surely do something!
My wife is a doctor and she has
herself volunteered. lt´s your duty...
l know all that, sir.
But we don´t have any transport
l´ve heard it all!
Please don´t keep repeating it
Our soldiers are posted there, sir
There must be a phone there surely?
Where are you?
l´m worried sick looking for you
Neither do l know where l am
l´m some 40 kilometers away
from the base camp
Are you all right?
Nothing´s happened to you, l hope?
l want to come there
to bring you back, Maya
Don´t come here, Akki.
We´re getting out of here
l want to see you
Don´t l want to see you too?
l´m coming over
Come soon, Maya
l´m scared...
what if something happens?
Nothing will happen
to me, Akki!
The locket of Lord Ganesha
you gave me...
on our first anniversary,
is still with me
Nothing will happen to me, Akki
Nothing´s going to
happen to me
Maya Bhatnagar wasn´t just a doctor.
She was God´s gift to society
She didn´t treat medical practice
like a profession, it was her religion
Each one of us here works
to gain something
But Maya always wanted to give,
she wished to serve
She never treated her little patients
any less than her own children
People had started believing that
Maya possessed some divine talent
More than medicines, Maya has
cured several patients...
with her love and care
We know, no one in the hospital
will be able to take her place
The loss of Maya we shall
feel forever
There was no doubt that the
accident in which Maya died...
was so horrible, that no one
could have survived it
l wonder how Maya
must have died
They say, you can say from the
face of the dead...
whether they´ve had a peaceful
death, or a horrible one
lt had become very necessary for me
to see Maya´s face
Finish your enquiry
as fast as possible
lt´s raining heavily,
it could get worse
We won´t be able to
get out of here, sir
You said it was 80 kilometers.
This is 1 10 kilometers extra
How much money are
you going to spend?
Here we are, sir
Hurry up, sir!
lt´s pouring heavily
l´m willing wait here for some
more time, Officer. Please!
lt´s raining so heavily, we don´t
know where whose body has gone
l advise you to return.
l´m staying here
l´m staying here till
your operation is over
Believe me, sir.
The operation is over
Deep down in my heart, l probably
wished that we didn´t find Maya´s body
Because in that wish of mine,
was hidden a hope
The hope of Maya being alive
l can´t say about others,
but that was the hope l lived on
Victims of the accident that took place
this morning have been admitted
How many of them?
6 have arrived...
6 of them have yet to be admitted
She was in that bus too, doctor
Take her to the O.T. immediately
and prepare for an operation
Doctor, this patient has 80º/.º/. burns...
Take him to the burns ward. Quick!
Anymore casualties?
Not as yet
This girl tried to commit suicide.
lf there was anymore delay, maybe...
Let Dr Mehta handle this case
But Dr Mehta´s handling
the pregnancy case
lf you could attend to this one...
Now look, nurse
l am the who decides
who handles which case
l don´t want to see patients who
themselves don´t wish to live
Ask Dr Mehta to handle the case.
Tell him those are my instructions
Chances of survival if
the pregnancy is terminated?
Difficult, sir
We need to do something
We need permission to
terminate the pregnancy
We don´t need it for
the delivery, do we?
What do you think?
Was that the right decision you made?
l think it was right.
To do an abortion on a woman...
6 months pregnant, a caesarean!
That too, without her permission!
The woman was unconscious. lt was not
possible to save both of them
l couldn´t save the mother,
but l somehow saved the baby
You refused to handle
that suicide case too
l entrusted it to Dr. Mehta.
Why?
Because you thought that patient
wasn´t worthy of you?
Can we talk about this
tomorrow?
Ever since Maya has died...
you´ve been working round the clock
for the last seven days
That hasn´t affected my efficiency
ln fact, your efficiency
has received a great boost
My hospital does not need
so much of efficiency
The rest of my staff can´t take it
The staff also complain that you have
become very irritable of late
l think you need to rest
After Maya´s death, maybe you
haven´t still cried enough
So you want me to stop working?
Go home and mourn the loss?
What is the name of the girl
who tried to end her life?
Janki.
Ward number?
Since Mr Goenka insisted,
l had to tell him that you...
Why did you bring me back?
From where?
From that world, which is
far better than this one
Have you seen that world?
No
So how can you say it´s
a better world than this one?
Because l have seen this world.
Why did you bring me back?
Love is beautiful, Janki
Not when you see with my eyes
Why not look at it through my eyes?
lf you did, you´d know...
how much life means
Why must l look at it
through your eyes?
Maybe not mine, look at it through
the eyes of those who love you
What happens of them?
You will leave only
questions for them
Questions, they´ll seek answers to,
all their lives
l´ve lost someone too.
ln an accident
l know what the anguish
of losing someone is
All l will tell you is,
whatever there is... is right here
There´s nothing there
Whatever we gain,
we gain here
Whatever we lose,
we lose right here
Why do you want to lose
what you´ve got?
You don´t get to live
every now and then?
You don´t get anything a second time.
Nothing
Why hasn´t Akash come yet?
He said he´d be coming
l wonder where he´s held up.
Good for him if he comes
A couple of drinks
will make him feel better
He´s going to go mad.
He´s thinking of Maya all the time
And he´ll get nothing out of that.
He must accept what has happened
He must, no doubt. But you know
how sensitive he is about Maya
Here´s some beer for you
Richard, get another beer
What have you been talking about?
About you
You´ll live a hundred years.
Thank of you, and there you are
Live a hundred years! lsn´t that what
you told Maya so many times too?
And what happened?
Did she live a hundred years?
Where are you going...?
Where...?
Sit down
l´ve ruined your evening
lt was a slip of the tongue,
l´m sorry
Hasn´t your cough been cured yet?
Did you take that cough syrup
l gave you?
You never listen to me.
l´ll take it...
stop being a doctor
so late in the night
You´re always feeding me
a dose of medicine
All right, give me 22 rupees
22 rupees?
l must ask for much more
Because what l´m going to give you
is worth much more
Maya´s parcel has arrived.
l had to pay 22 rupees as postage
Let me have it
Maya´s parcel...?
How can it arrive?
Six months old. Thanks to the
postal department, it arrives now
Here you are. Revive old memories and
keep awake all night for all l care
Hey! My 22 rupees!
l owe it as a friend.
l´ll return it to you
That parrot of yours
makes a lot of noise
Take him with you tomorrow.
And go to bed early
What´s the matter?
Tanya was complaining about you
You are my life.
You are with me...
l no longer care
for this world
l´ll take a life,
l´ll give up my life...
l don´t care what price
l have to pay
You are my life.
You are with me...
There´s no other desire
like your love...
for yours is a love that
is not put on
Nature has bestowed on you
unparalleled beauty...
it is untouched by the
corruption in the world
l must have it
at any cost...
l don´t care, even if
l have to lose my life for it
You are my life.
You are with me...
You are my God,
you are my faith...
that you love me,
is a great favour to me
You are the brightness
of the morning for me...
for me, you are
a silken evening
l wish to live
in your heart all my life...
l care not for another nest
You are my life.
You are with me...
l no longer care
for this world
You´re not going there Maya.
l am!
People there are dying in the floods.
Children, women, the old...
And no doctor is willing to go there.
l am going there
There is the problem of militancy.
lt´s very dangerous there
Please don´t be stubborn.
You are the one who´s being stubborn
Don´t go is all you´ve been
saying for the last two days
As a doctor, how can you stop another
doctor from doing her duty?
Why must only doctors from Delhi go the
Burma borders to perform their duty?
Are there no doctors in Calcutta,
Assam, Mizoram and Manipur?
There are. But they are not interested
in going to the Burma borders
ln fact, no one wants to go there
Not doctors, not engineers,
not even the politicians
Why would anyone go there?
Not everyone is naive like you
l´m better off being naive
You´re not going all alone
You´re carrying my baby with you
You need to rest.
Akki...
you were the one who said, we´re
doctors first, everything else later
Have faith in me. l´ll look after
myself and look after my baby too
Please. Let me go
lf you really love me,
you mustn´t go
lf you really love me, you will
not stop me from going there
What will he teach me?
He´s an ass!
So you teach him.
That´s what l´ve got to do
He´s an ass!
So tell me. How many years
have you known Akash?
5 years.
5 years
How many years will
you tolerate him?
Looks like l´ll have to
tolerate him all my life
All your life...?
What if he dies before you?
l´ll go away before you
l´ll go away before you,
but l won´t stop following you
l´ll come to meet you every day.
Every day!
You´re so worried
about a paper-weight?
How could it fall on its own?
Why not? lt´s so simple.
lt´s not simple. Maya was the one
who gave me that paper-weight
So?
Not just the paper-weight
l found the projector on too.
You must´ve left it on
Unless someone manually switches on
the project, it can´t come on, Tanya
So what are you trying to tell me?
That Maya came to you last night?
She was the one who switched on
the projector?
And dropped the paper-weight?
How else did it all happen?
lt happened because you still haven´t
accepted that Maya is no more, Akash
lt happens.
lt happened to me too
When someone you love so dearly
goes away suddenly...
we are just not willing
to accept the truth
For a few days, we feel as if
they´re somewhere around us
That´s what you must be feeling too.
l mean...
probably that paper-weight
was on the edge, and slipped off
But you...
Ever since Maya has gone away,
it´s very strange at home
Bittu has fallen silent too
Whenever Maya knocked
at the door earlier...
he´d begin chanting,
Maya´s back! Maya´s back!
lt says nothing now. A scary silence
has descended on the house
Akash, take a few days off
My flight´s taking off for Goa
l had promised Maya that l would
look after her patients
Take care, Akash
l know what´s playing
on your mind right now
Just that l´ve made you wait
six months for a little favour
l´m happy you have helped me,
even if it´s a bit late
You take instant decisions
during surgery...
but official matters take time
l´m not a very bad man. lt´s just
that l have my own responsibilities
Which is why... l´ve got to be
a bit firm at times
There´s something more l´ve
got to tell you
You´re going to work where
Maya used to work and l hope...
you will not give anyone
cause for complaint
Just as Maya loved children
and treated them...
l´ll do that too, Dr. Goenka
Happiness of the past
is always painful
Despite knowing that, l started
spending my nights...
in Maya´s ward,
to escape loneliness
l had no other way of
finding peace of mind
Like everyone else, l did not
believe God, souls and rebirth...
which give us only false hopes.
Little did l know...
that faith would cast its rays
on my life...
that would gradually develop
into an ocean...
and change the course
of my life
Akki! Can you hear me?
lt has happened earlier, doctor
Twice earlier,
we thought Nakul was dead
There was nothing to tell us
that he was alive
And he suddenly returns to life.
He says...
he has passed through some tunnel...
where there was a lot of light
and everything was very clear
Do you believe in such things?
l didn´t earlier
But the last time Nakul
came back...
he told me that he had
met my elder sister
After just an hour,
l got a call from my village...
that my elder sister had passed away
l´m Dr Akash Bhatnagar
ln any case, you don´t need an
introduction in Dr Maya´s ward
The child who was brought into
the lCU... what was his name?
Can l meet him?
Dr Maya used to ask about him
the moment she arrived too
She used to love him very much
l want to see Nakul
How is he now?
See for yourself
He´s been drawing
as if nothing had happened to him
You like to draw?
What are you drawing?
l don´t know. l´ve been thinking
about it, ever since l came around
Last night you were shocked,
weren´t you uncle?
Last night? When?
When your glasses got wet
How do you know?
l was watching you
Watching me?
Yes, from the ceiling
Nakul, do your drawings,
talk less
Nurse, l have to talk to him.
You can´t, doctor
We have strict instruction from
the hospital authorities
We must discourage patients
from talking like that
Talking like what?
Like Sister Martha used to
She used to record the experiences
of the dead who came back to life
She used to quiz them
in a way that would make them uneasy
But Sister Martha never met me.
Had she, l´d have told her so much
l remember everything
that l had seen there
Doctor, l have to check on a patient
at ward two. l´ll be back soon
Do you know my name, Nakul?
Akash, Have you heard it before?
Akash
Akki
Maya´s Akki?
Yes... Maya´s Akki
l met Maya too yesterday
Where?
l don´t know
lt was so bright there
and water everywhere
She was saying something?
What was she saying?
What was she saying, Nakul?
What was she saying, Nakul?
Akki!
Akki!
According to recent medical studies,
all those who have had...
near-death experience say that
there´s a tunnel, brightness...
That´s what most of them say
l wonder why
Let me explain. Medical science
studies show that after death...
the cornea slowly shrinks and creates
a tunnel-shaped image in the brain
But Akash says the boy
remembers much more
Like, Akash´s entry into the room,
watching him on the sly...
Could be. The body dies
but the brain doesn´t die instantly
The brain saves those impressions
that the person sees before his death
When did he see a drop of water falling
on my glasses? He was never around
He was dying when he was
being taken away in a stretcher
l felt as if he was
calling out to me Akki
Only your daughter used
to call me Akki, no one else
You are a psychiatrist, Neha.
What do you have to say?
Papa, a psychiatrist first listens.
l would like to hear from Akash
What does he feel these days?
These days? What do you mean?
l have told you all that
what is happening with me
All but one thing. Do you really feel
that Maya is calling out to you?
l don´t think so.
Check yourself, Akash
Could it be that you are scared
of telling the truth?
Papa, l´ll be back
Akash, l won´t charge you fees
if you consult me
l don´t need to.
l knew that would be your answer
l´d like to tell you something
l didn´t tell you back there
Maya was not merely my wife, she was
a friend, she meant everything to me
Yes, l miss her. And l feel that she
is somewhere around trying to meet me
But that doesn´t mean that
l have forgotten the truth
l know that l can´t
get back Maya ever again
Wait, Akash.
Don´t leave like that
Pour your heart out
and feel less burdened
l don´t need to tell anyone
what l feel and what l don´t
Sometimes fragrance,
sometimes a waft...
sometimes l feel it´s the breeze
You are far away from me...
yet l feel you are within me
This only thought...
keeps me away at nights
Should l sleep...
l would dream about you
And when at dawn...
my eyes open...
like the stars...
you would vanish too
Coming to me and going away...
hurts... hurts a lot
You are far away from me...
yet l feel you are within me
What´s your name?
Biren
l´m Akash.
l know
Your sketches are so lovely
She is calling out to you
Who is calling out to me?
She said she was a doctor here
Doctor? Who?
Her picture is hung near the corridor
The one who has
worn Santa Claus´ gown
She´s calling out to you,
uncle Akash
l don´t understand anything.
When l was being brought here...
l saw her in my dream
lsn´t she dead, uncle?
Was it only a dream?
Probably
But she is calling you, uncle.
Where is she calling me?
All right, have we met before?
l don´t know
Then how do you know me?
She showed me a picture of yours
Where? Where did she
show you my picture?
ln some picture?
ln my mind
Can you tell me where you met her?
Do you know the place?
Over there
There? How will l get there?
How does one get there?
l don´t know
The boy in room 302...?
302? Biren?
Yes. Did he know my wife?
l´ll check, hang on
No doctor, this is the first time
the boy is admitted here
That too only two weeks back
Knowing your wife
is just out of question
Nakul was a patient
who was everyone´s pet
His coming back to life
and saying that he met Maya...
Chocolate for your coffee?
No
Nakul says that Maya is in some place
where it´s full of light...
and water all around
Biren too says Maya
is calling me out there
Too much sugar, no?
Why aren´t you listening to me?
What´s all this about chocolate and
coffee? l wish to tell you something
And l intend to distract you from
all these things that are unrealistic
Unrealistic? How can you be sure?
Four years ago
when Vinod passed away...
and l was running crazy looking
for him everywhere, you helped me out
l said he´s alive and he´ll return
and you used to tell me it´s absurd
Didn´t you say that?
But Tanya...
But what? Have you forgotten?
So many times you and Maya...
brought me back from the accident site
where l used to wait for Vinod
Because l felt he was alive
and he´d return
l lost a year and a half of my life
just to understand that...
a person never returns from the dead
l don´t want you to lose
years of your life too
All that l told you is real
Akash, you are a doctor.
How could you believe all this?
What explanation does
all this have scientifically?
lf you think too much about it,
you will go crazy
Stay away from all those things
that remind you of Maya
lt´s Maya!
Maya is here!
