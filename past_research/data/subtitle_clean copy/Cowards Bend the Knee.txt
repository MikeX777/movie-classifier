operations of his very own -

His precious hockey cards...
His tarot.

of meeting someone new!
Sweet oppression of fresh love!
Un-trysting themselves,
Guy and ghost return...
"I've been visiting Mother.
She's doing well."
"That's interesting.
She died last night!"
"You poor, poor man."

Guy's promise kept! ...
...He now believes his
obligations to the vengeful
daughter are complete.
"PLEASE CUT THESE
WRETCHED MURDERERS OFF ME!"
"You silly boy!
These are your own hands!"
"The transplant was a hoax!"
"You silly, silly fool!"

DIRECTLY TO THE ARENA
THE CARDS FORETELL
A MYSTERIOUS APOCALYPSE

BACK WITH HIS BUDDIES
"I see you still need
your hand held."
"You're as cold as I am!"
"I LIKE IT, SOMEHOW!"
"Tonight you shall know
how it feels to have
a slain father!"
MAROONS SWEAR
VENGEANCE ON SOVIETS!
Up on the catwalk,
a game of a different sort.
Veronica's ghost traces
and retraces her steps
high above the rink...
...stepping cruelly
across the surface of
Guy's fevered brain...
...and onto his panting,
aching breast.

"Wait..."
"NO!"

the Museum is a sanctuary...
...in this case, for cowards, for
