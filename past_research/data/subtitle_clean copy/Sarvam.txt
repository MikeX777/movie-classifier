Come! Let us make it grand!
Let us fly without getting anxious,
Our life is a flower basket, buddy,
It can blossom up in anyone's hold,
I don't bother if anything happens,
Won't I able to avoid it?
Give me a good life to celebrate,
Does the life have any phase?
I'm a bird with wings
and it keeps on walking,
The world is not enough to live my life,
Ok! Let us see it,
Let us enjoy this life,
Our life is a flower basket, buddy,
It can blossom up in anyone's hold,
Move man.
Move man.
You..
Hey! You Ioon.
- What do you think of yourself?
- No Karthik.
See what I'm going to do to you!
Keep quiet man.
Speed only matters.
Not knocking
- Keep quiet.
- Look there.
- Leave her. - Leave.
- Isn't it you?
Be bold by gaining your strength,
Neither panic nor cry,
The Lord your God is ever with you,
9th verse in chapter 1 of Joshua.
It's been days, isn't it?
It's been months.
I came to a place.
That place is not as we think.
Central jail.
That's a different world.
I was thinking about you only
even over there.
- Tell me man.
- Bring it fast.
- Site supervisor Ramesh fell down from top.
- Take him first to a hospital.
Of course I'm sending him there.
I'm just informing this.
Come soon. Go soon.
Ok, I'm coming there.
Cut the call.
What's this?
Pouring the water in bucket..!
- It's better to keep as it is
than washing it! -What are you doing?
- Now only I cleaned it. - You're always
buying car to the size of this or this!
- You don't have style.
- Go.
- Won't all see when I go in a car?
- Yes.
Buy a swift car.
It'll be excellent.
It has two lines like that of a squirrel.
- Ok! I'll buy it.
- Wait.
This is what you told earlier.
But didn't buy it.
This time I'll buy it for sure.
Ok, you go, take bath and get ready.
- We've to go to the hospital.
- You go, I'm not coming.
Black colour swift with
lines like squirrel.
Ok, I'll buy.
- Then write it and sign.
- On which?
On this. Write and put your sign.
Where have you gone
by making us to lament?
Look at this, he fell down
from the top while working.
What to do?
It has happened so like this!
You place it.
Get up and see. Your colleagues have come,
but you're lying like this. My dear!
See the extent of his affection on you
that he has fainted.
Is there sugar?
Where have you gone
by making us to lament?
- Hey.
- What?
- Why are you crying now?
- Then what?
Not crying in a funeral house,
will anyone cry in a wedding house?
Look there of how all are crying.
You too cry man.
Ilayaraja sir.
Don't play it here.
What an atrocity?
- Hey
- What?
Didn't I say that I hear Ilayaraja's
music when I see a girl?
- She has come.
- Did you hear it. - No.
See there.
Why is she going without informing?
Wait, I'll come.
People don't inform and leave
in the house of bereaved!
Brother, see him.
Come man.
How is it?
- Has he gone?
- He has gone.
- What happened to you?
- I struggled a lot.
- Is Sandhya there?
- Sandhya speaking. You?
What hello?
You'll just go by knocking my car.
Did you think that I can't find you?
Who are you?
What number do you want?
I've found your number after a long
struggle. Indeed a guy is lying on top.
Ok, leave that.
Did you come to Alwarpet yesterday?
Yes, I came.
Did you come near Sanskrit college?
- Where...? Yes!
- Did you come for a death?
Yes, they were known to me.
It was there that you hit me.
You hit my car.
- No.
- What no!
- Ok, where did I hit it?
- You've to come in person
- ...and tell by seeing my dent.
- Ok, I'll come.
Who was that over phone?
A guy says that his car is damaged
by the hitting of my car.
- I'll go and see it.
- You've hit it, didn't you?
Why should you go for it?
I'll go in person to see
what the problem is.
- You may come. Come sir.
- Come here.
I am parking.
It has hit.
- I only called you.
- You...
- ECR... carting! -That day too
you hit, and today as well!
- Where did I hit?
- Look, what has happened!
- Ok, why did you ask me
to come here? - Here!
My mechanic is coming here. Come.
First let's decide by sitting inside.
From outside itself...!
Come.
Take your seat. Be seated.
What would you have?
Tea?
- I don't want. - Coffee?
- I'm not used to it.
Then have milkshake.
You can't say, you're not used to it!
I couldn't have hit it at all.
I learnt in a good driving school only.
- Indeed I was the first over there.
- Had there been a race over there?
- I don't even walk in one-way road.
- One can walk through a one-way road.
It isn't wrong to do so!
Leave that.
Tell me how did I knock your car.
- Give me your mobile.
- What for?
- Give me.
- Careful, it's an i-phone
This is your car, and this is mine.
An idiot has parked
before your car like this.
Not able to move forward,
you reversed and hit my car.
Had my car been reversed, it should've
hit your car at front only, isn't it?
This was actually like this.
This is your car, and this is mine.
Now the same idiot has parked
behind your car.
Unable to reverse back, you moved forward
and hit slightly at the left.
You said, I hit to its left. But,
isn't your car dented at the right?
I don't know all that.
You hit while moving front or back!
You're lying.
I couldn't have hit it at all.
Even suppose I had hit it, tell what
I should do. We'll finish the deal.
What are you doing?
In which hospital?
I respect doctors well.
I'll solve this dent issue.
You may have this milkshake and go.
I'll come to your hospital
if there's a need.
I don't want.
Oh yuck! I couldn't.
- It's been so long, but she hasn't come.
- She'll come. She might be busy.
- Is she like you?
- It's all because of you only.
- What?
- She's coming.
Is she coming?
She is coming.
She hasn't come.
- Do you recognise me?
- Is your car dent ok?
These are my friends.
- I want to talk to you alone.
- Tell me, what's the matter?
- I want to talk to her alone.
- Talk buddy.
Alone buddy!
- So, is that it?
- That's it.
Didn't you say, you've work?
Go!
- Tell me. - I want to talk
a personal matter.
- Is it on any problem of yours?
- No, not like that.
- I don't know how to tell it.
- Shall I fix some other doctor if needed?
I am in pediatric ward.
Tell me without hesitation.
Nothing should be concealed from doctors.
It's ok, tell me.
Shall we talk by having some coffee?
Ok, tell me.
Why have you come here?
I don't fell sleepy during nights.
I feel dark when I close my eyes.
Opening my eyes,
I see fan rotating on top.
Getting up to see the streets,
none is there.
It's just the lamps
that glow flickering
A dog is only barking
at a far distance.
Same does happen near
my house at midnight
It was at that time, I gave a thought.
I gave a thought by sitting, lying,
walking and bending.
It's only one matter that I see clearly
no matter how I think.
I like you very much.
We'll marry.
That is, I like you very much.
We'll marry.
What do you expect me to say?
Tell me that you too like me.
That's all! What do you say?
I am leaving.
Iman! Come.
Park the car.
I'll be back.
Go and see her.
- I would like to see Mr. Naushad.
- He isn't here.
He's not been to office
for quite few days.
My son is gone.
- You..?
- Naveen's dad.
You knocked down my wife
and my son with your car.
My son is gone.
It's case is been dealt in court.
It was an accident.
Why have you come here?
This is my office, a place where I work.
My son is gone.
Now I'm leaving urgently.
Let's meet later.
My son..
My son is gone.
No, I am in an important work.
Yes. Tell it later.
Then?
Do you phone through a camera?
- Why are you shooting me?
- I'm getting ready from my side.
Shouldn't I've at least a passport size
photo if not a big blow up of my fiancee?
It's for this reason only.
Why all of a sudden
you're talking of marriage?
All of a sudden?
I told it that day itself, didn't I?
I'm telling it again by thinking,
that's all!
Do you say like this to any girl you see?
- I tell it only when I see you.
- Why should I marry you?
- You're beautiful.
- I know it.
You're very beautiful even in sorrow.
- You've high tolerance.
- I don't have tolerance at all!
You don't get angry.
You don't know about my anger.
Don't make it known.
Ok, leave it.
Why shouldn't you marry me?
Just tell one reason for it.
Not one, I've hundred reasons.
First, I don't like to marry you.
Rest 99 is too the same only!
Ok, don't you have any other work?
I'm an architect. Projects are going on
in Annanagar, T Nagar, and Besant nagar.
I'm actually busy.
- I've many work.
- Ok.
This is a hospital.
You shouldn't behave like this.
I'm telling you very decently
that you don't come here at all.
How are you?
Has your cough gone?
Has it gone?
Ok. Come on.
- What happened?
- What are you doing here?
Go out first.
I want to talk an important matter.
I'll go out after talking.
You'll not believe if I say.
Last night I was sleeping well.
Suddenly a sound...! Opened my eyes,
I saw your face spread on the ceiling.
Isn't there a fan in your house?
Whenever I see you,
Sir Ilayaraja is playing music in me!
Do you too listen to his music?
M.S. Vishwanathan's music!
So, M.S.V. is playing music in you
whenever you see me?
- I'll come later, ok?
- I'll come later, ok?
Do you know how I feel now
when I see you?
I feel like 1000's of colourful
butterflies flapping inside me!
How do you feel when you see me?
Any butterfly?
I feel like puking.
Is it enough?
You don't believe it, don't you?
How is it?
Later.
What's your name?
Could you ask this sister to marry me?
- I'll marry you if not her.
- You?
But, you've to wait a while!
I'll marry Sandhya only.
Simply!
Look, aren't you jealous?
You didn't like her say
that she'll marry me.
Why have you brought them for this?
Some nights never come to an end,
Some dreams will not leave us,
Some foot prints never fade off,
Some memories never get drowned,
It is you who are in my nerve system,
It is you who've fondled my eye brows!
Some nights never come to an end,
Some dreams will not leave us,
Some foot prints never fade off,
Some memories never get drowned,
It is you who are in my nerve system,
It is you who've fondled my eye brows!
Are you running through
my heart as your path?
Is your feet aching a bit?
If you search in my eyes,
you can find your foot prints!
I came to understand
the secret of the universe,
It was concealed under your saree
Even if I face accidents...
Your memories help me to escape,
Telling the truth and feel it,
It is you who are my soul,
It is you... it is you... in my nerves!
It is you... it is you... in my nerves!
My son is gone.
I couldn't be normal.
How are you able to be so?
- Why here... could you come in?
- My son is gone.
Dealt in court, the case is over.
I didn't do it on purpose.
It happened unwittingly.
Why to my son? Do you know
how all I desired to bring him up?
I thought of making him achieve
of what I couldn't!
You broke my desires,
didn't you?
What are you trying to say?
Should I do something?
You don't understand my pain.
Don't come like this again.
It doesn't look good.
You still don't understand my pain.
Ok, what's that
you expect me to do now?
You've to understand my pain.
What are you trying to convey?
Are you threatening me?
You've to understand my pain!
You're talking not knowing
of what you say.
Leave.
Taking away that which was with me,
you're scolding me to leave, aren't you?
I'm not scolding.
You are only yelling.
I didn't yell.
Go inside.
You're bringing up your son
with extreme care, aren't you?
But my son?
I'll separate your son from you.
Come.
You too lose your son and
come with me to sit in graveyard.
Only then will you know my pain
and understand my agony!
- Go man.
- You should know my pain.
No one is there.
It's long since they vacated.
Careful!
- Didn't I tell you not to come here?
- I didn't come for you.
I came for Shakti only!
Do you know what happened?
You'll not believe if I say it.
Karthik has full power.
So is why I paint Spiderman on him.
- Enough.
- You only asked me to say this.
- Go and lie down first.
- Wait.
Lot of accidents in me yesterday!
Car and bike were flying.
But nothing happened to me only.
I myself came to know yesterday
that I have so much power.
These men like superman, spiderman,
batman, Rajnikanth are there, isn't it?
- It's the power like them.
- Why do you say this to me?
It's all because of you only. All these
happen in me only after I saw you.
For example, what'll happen
if I jump out of that window?
You'll die.
That alone will not happen.
I'll cheat the death itself!
Is it?
Then do a thing. Go and jump.
Emergency ward is in ground floor only.
You'll directly fall over there only.
You get the mortuary ready.
Phone up to the ward and tell that
a body is coming there directly.
Proceed.
I didn't finish my painting.
Tell Krishna.
I've bought 2 tickets for Simbu's film.
You said that you'll pick me up..
I'm going to jump from a building.
When?
Are you going to jump?
- 9th floor?
- Yes.
Ok, not for Simbu's film but lets go
for Ajith's film. What do you say?
I'll call you first
immediately after I land down, ok?
What, are you playing? I'm telling you
very seriously that I'll jump!
Go and jump.
Call senior doctor.
Check the pressure.
Soon.
- I never expected this..!
- You go.
Don't stand here.
You don't know how important
it's to save a life.
Everything is a joke for you.
A fun for you!
Go first.
What for are you still standing here?
Are you going to call me to marry you?
Look some other girl to show your skills
in flying butterflies and jumping down!
First, go and consult a doctor.
Go and consult a psychiatrist.
She scolded me like anything.
- But she scolded while crying.
- Why are you saying that smilingly?
There is a meaning behind her scolding.
So I was quiet.
You know that little girl Skathi,
don't you?
I don't know.
She indeed told that she'll marry me.
That minute, I myself
was confused of what to do.
When I myself felt so like that,
how would've the poor Sandhya been?
So did I let her to cry.
- Karthik, be careful.
- That's indeed the problem.
I am not able to speak when I see her.
Why did she scold me?
She blasted me because she liked me much.
She says, I'm cheating her by
exhibiting magic. Which is magic?
I showed her of butterflies are flying.
Is that a magic?
I told her that I can cheat death
if I think of her.
But she told a matter.
She told, my mind isn't stable,
and asked me to consult a psychiatrist.
- No!
- Do I need to consult a doctor?
You hear Ilayaraja's music inside you,
don't you?
Full of Ilayaraja.
It comes out whenever I see her.
What song?
I saw, in your song,
Dance, come and dance,
Ask him about it.
Did you attempt to commit suicide?
You told that you can cheat death,
didn't you?
Did you attempt to jump from a building
saying that you're going to cheat death?
You attempted to jump from a building!
This is what I keep on saying.
No one listens to it.
They're not at all understanding me.
Damn it!
I too heard a song same like this
20 years ago during 1980s!
What song?
My sweet golden moon,
My dreams in that golden moon,
Actress Shoba too is there in it,
isn't she?
- But no girl loved me.
- Oh my god!
- Did it pain so much?
- Leave that.
Too much is what you're doing!
Very filmy.
Have you ever told her of what that's in
your heart by looking into her eyes?
No doctor. She flees if she sees me.
How do I see her eyes in such a state!
Give a try, you can definitely do it.
I tried it so like this and finally saw
straight into her eyes at Krishnan temple.
- After seeing?
- I fell to her feet at once.
That's it, now I've two children.
- Who do they resemble like?
- Like her, as intelligent.
Tomorrow itself I'll make it
by seeing her
Is it at Krishnan temple?
Each week a guest comes here to share
with us of what that's in their heart.
This week.
My name is Karthik.
I've come to have a
heart-to-heart talk with you.
I'm not used to talk over mike like this.
I'm not going to tell a big matter
like father.
I don't know that.
I am not a Christian.
So what? Is religion like Hindu, Muslim
or Christian important?
I am right, am I not?
Tell me.
Now, the basic fact of all religion
is one and the same.
Love.
If we like a person,
we show our love for them.
Isn't it true? Tell me. Yes.
What would we expect from them in return?
Isn't it love?
Not hatred, isn't it?
Isn't it father?
Now what I'm trying to say is that,
... there's a girl in this church
whom I like very much.
I won't tell her name.
Could you come here for a while?
You all don't mistake me.
I came here only to tell, that which is
in my heart in the presence of God,
...like how you give your confessions.
I've given my love.
Now if that girl gives her love accepting
this, I'll surely take care of her
I'll keep her very happy,
I'll save her...
Give me 2 minutes, I'll finish.
I'll keep her very happy.
How did you come in?
Door was open.
Where is Naushad?
- You?
- I know.
I don't know Naushad.
I went to his office.
I was told that you know.
I know him. That's all.
I'm not much acquainted with him.
In office only.
He doesn't keep in touch with me.
He doesn't even call me.
Could you offer me a glass of water?
- Tell me Narayanan.
- A man came in search of you.
He told that he knows you.
He enquired about you.
I managed to send him by telling that
I don't know anything.
What's happening here?
You're concealing something.
You're not even telling anything.
Be careful. Ok, I'll cut the line.
- You go out. - I'll come later.
- Come in.
Why did you disgrace me by
blabbering incessantly at church?
Did I disgrace you?
Didn't I talk from heart?
- Didn't all accept it to be right?
- They yelled.
You're hitting me with rights.
- I'll tell an important matter and go.
- Tell and go.
Now you'll tell me to go. But tomorrow,
you'll marry an unknown fellow...
...beget babies, become old
and toothless...
...and walk with a stick howling!
Then you'll think that
you could've married me and
...cry sadly by thinking that you
couldn't tell me your heart's desire.
But tell yes now. The church you say,
be it Santhome church or Vatican church
...I'll take you there and marry you.
We'II love without boring
...and run family with joy.
We'll beget babies, but it'll be twins,
...of which one, like you
and the other, like me!
Ok leave it, both will be like you!
Then they'll go to school and to college
...then love and marry. Even in such case,
you'll say no to love-marriage
...but I'll say yes! After that they'll
beget babies, we'll become grandparents
...unable to walk we'II lean on each other
and love even more happily,
...at that time I'll die before you.
You'll cry at that time also.
But you'll cry in a happiness
of having lived a very happy life!
Is crying sadly like that is better or
crying happily like this?
oh my god, I couldn't further..!
I'm going to cry anyway,
it'll be better if you go.
Now if I go out through that door,
I'll not come back again.
Think well and tell.
I'm telling by thinking well only,
you need not come.
Have a last look at me.
I'm going...
I'm going, I've gone!
I saw my friend at the supermarket.
Her friend has seen you somewhere.
Liked you very much, she desired to
get her son married to you.
- I too okayed it.
- Have you fixed it?
You only...!
Seal these first.
- Is Karthik here?
- He isn't here.
I don't know where he is.
Did you phone up and try?
I tried, but couldn't get his line.
Should I convey anything if I see him?
- Are you thinking about me only?
- No.
It seems someone came to the site
in search of me!
I've decided to get married.
I came to say that only.
This is what I expected.
Then?
I'll marry. I'll beget children.
I'll beget twins.
I'll get them married as arranged.
I'll become a granny.
Turning grey and toothless,
I'll walk howling by leaning on a stick
...and I'll cuddle well
with grandchildren.
I'll die before you.
You sit and cry then.
Cry and lament happily by thinking
of the happy life we lived.
Why should you die and I cry?
You sit and cry by thinking about me.
My dear darling.
How marriage, babies, twins and
toothless mouth without touching?
Ok, you could've said this earlier itself,
isn't it? I struggled a lot.
You girls couldn't be understood at all!
Girls?
How many?
It's you only as of now.
Then, it'll be you only forever.
You are in me like
the scent in the breeze,
I am in you like the rain in the forest!
It will never go off with the soil,
The smell of rain is like you in my heart
It will never finish with the eyes,
The dampness of the soul is
like me always... like me,
As solitude creeps
in the middle of a forest
Beautiful desires give way to
feelings of pleasure
World changes
Searching for the life's pleasure,
As solitude creeps
in the middle of a forest
Beautiful desires give way to
feelings of pleasure
World changes
Searching for the life's pleasure,
You're a female forest that longs for
the flower to bud without sunlight,
You're a surrounding cloud that
conjoins the roots and greens the water,
Sea wind touched your heart
and it utters your name strongly,
Lap of waves widens
and it lifts you,
Sea wind touched your heart
and it utters your name strongly,
Lap of waves widens
and it lifts you,
Thirsts couldn't be
quenched on the ground,
Heat strikes me from your breath,
Tremors never depart from me,
Your body shreds clothes
Whom do you want to see?
- Would he be wearing spectacles?
- Yes.
He's my student only. Why hasn't he
come for school all these days?
We've intimated,
but no response any.
What is your relation to him?
I know him.
What Naushad? Is it now
only that you remember us?
Not like that.
We have come, haven't we?
Iman is alone at home.
He too will get bored, won't he?
I too feel worried
seeing him so like that.
So I brought him here for few days.
Oh god! I didn't tell in that sense.
Why few days? You may
stay here as long you wish.
Consider its like your home.
Give it to me once.
- Look uncle, he's asking.
- No Iman.
- That is a glazed one. You'll get
your hands cut. -  His kite has got off.
Haven't we kited a lot during our
childhood? Aren't they kids? Allow them.
- Look here.
- Hey, it looks superb!
- Isn't it flying wonderfully?
- Don't grip it.
- Let it loose.
- It's looks superb, isn't it?
This is the entrance.
Come.
Come!
Here will be our hall.
This side and that side
have nothing!
You may have it as you wish.
Look there.
A big guest room will be over there.
That'll be the place of limit both
for your friends and my friends.
They shouldn't come beyond that. Ok?
A beautiful kitchen will be over there.
Your department.
- I will not cook.
- It's ok we'll order it.
A big bedroom will be at the back,
for our children.
We should be alone, shouldn't we?
So would they be at some distance away!
It'll not be audible of
however one shouts. Children!
We can keep building rooms
as we keep begetting children!
Either this side or that side
will be a beautiful clinic for you.
How is it?
Did I tell anything sad?
I feel very happy.
I'll not be worried even if I lose
my life now in this minute.
Oh god!
It looks, this plan have to be changed!
How would it be to conclude
when we've started it just now?
Ok, leave that.
Ask your dad to postpone
our marriage for a year.
I'll finish my projects and
you'll finish your course by then.
One year?
No way at all.
You'll chase to love me.
Once I agree,
will you postpone the marriage?
- I'll handle you after marriage.
- So I am asking you to postpone a year!
Wait.
- Ok, not for you, not for me.
- You only don't want, but I do want!
But a bet. If I win in it,
you've to obey to what I say.
If you win, I'll obey
to what you say. Ok?
I'll only win for sure.
What is the bet?
Tell me.
Nothing serious, isn't it?
Nothing will happen to you. Ok?
Nothing has happened to you.
Nothing will happen.
You brought her here with struggle.
More blood got lost since her
carotid artery and jugular vein got cut.
We tried our best but couldn't save her.
What are you saying doctor?
That you couldn't save Sandhya.
It couldn't be so.
She will be alive for sure.
Something could've happened by mistake.
I don't say that you've done a mistake.
But some small mistake
could've happened, isn't it?
Go and see her once. Please!
Ask him to go and see.
Just now a few minutes ago..
...that she was happily
riding a cycle with smile.
Her smiling face still remains
before my eyes.
It was a small thread, buddy. How'll that
take a life by slitting the throat?
Mom! That is a thin kite thread.
It got entangled in her throat and
I took it out then itself.
It is a glazed thread, isn't it?
Hence it cut her.
Look at mom.
Why are you crying simply and
making others cry as well?
You're allergic to hospital, aren't you?
She gave me the small cycle
and she took the big one.
Hence she overtook me.
I too tried.
I should've gone before.
Had I gone before, she would've now
suffered this pain, wouldn't she?
No buddy,
she couldn't have endured it.
Look how they are crying.
Aren't they her parents?
That's it, isn't it?
It's over.
Somebody has to sign
to take her, isn't it?
Come man.
Her parents are there for it.
We didn't get married.
So I can't sign.
- Come.
- It's ok.
Why have you come here uncle?
Had you called me I would've come.
- It's ok.
- Take your seat.
- How are you?
- Fine.
I can clearly see it at your face.
How long are you going to be like this?
I feel proud of Sandhya!
I am very happy.
She kept on helping others
when she was alive.
She has helped even after her death.
She has saved a life even
during her death.
She has saved a life by giving her heart
as a replacement for a dying heart.
Sandhya hasn't left me.
- I need a patient's address.
- Name?
Where is Naushad's house?
No one is there.
Come.
- Isn't this Naushad's house?
- They've vacated the house.
They're frequently changing their house.
Did you check in their previous house?
Do someone else know about
where they've gone?
I only know all,
but I don't know this alone!
April 25th is my wedding day..
...hence I do remember well
about that boy's surgery.
That boy sent me some greeting card.
See if this could help you.
What are you doing?
Didn't you say that you wouldn't marry?
But they're talking about our marriage.
Didn't you threaten to jump
from upstairs? Hence all this.
I didn't want a life
to die because of me.
How if it goes?
Now you express your love for me.
Wings grew for me to go somewhere
Night depleted slowly from my eyes
Memories long to see you
By what to I lift as my dreams boils
Pain reaches to pinch you inside
Pleasure gathers by searching you,
It'll take some period, some distance
and some time to over take you!
This longing, this path, this journey
has become my life by searching you
With what to lift my boiling dreams
Pain reaches to pinch you inside
Pleasure gathers by searching you,
Shouldn't the shore search
for you, my river?,
Shouldn't the clouds search
for you, my moon?
Who'll know the Cuckoo's song
struggling on a rainy night?
Who'll know the dreams of
shrubs that is on the lap of sea?
Where are you my beauty?
My dear! You are there where it pains,
What are you doing, my life?
You are getting inside my life and going,
Where is my heart?
It's not inside the flower or above the
moon or under the fire or outside the wind
It is there in your eyes, in your breath,
in your night, in your heart,
...in your hand, and in your life,
Wings grew for me to go somewhere
Night depleted slowly from my eyes
Memories long to see you
As one eye sink in honey
and the other suffer in pain
How'll I dream in middle?
It'll take some period, some distance
and some time to over take you!
This longing, this path, this journey
has become my life by searching you
Sayeed! See! The car has come.
- The car has stopped.
- Ask in.
- The car has stopped.
- Where from? - Chennai!
You go and see.
It will take 2 or 3 days to repair it.
I want it immediately.
See how many are there!
Eswar! Look! Why do you stare like that?
Don't you know me?
I'm Sayeed.
We played together
in the district foot ball match.
Why do you look like that?
Aren't you Eswar?
I'm Sayeed then!
You've forgotten the past.
When did you come to Munnar?
- Only now.
- What happened?
The valve connecting
the engine has cut off.
You will get the car in a day.
Let's go.
You are staying with me. Ok?
I have not seen you for many years.
I feel very happy now.
Do you remember?
If you had not fought in the committee...
...they wouldn't have
included in the team...
...and I wouldn't have played
in the district match.
What are you doing now?
Easwar! I'm asking you!
Aren't you married
and have a child?
Instead of bringing them,
you have brought the dog!
Where are they?
- They are dead.
- Sorry buddy.
This is my house! This not my own.
It's my boss's!
He is in Cochin!
We are the care takers.
She is my wife Reshmu.
You come here.
He is my son Raja.
Say hello to uncle.
He is my friend.
He has come from his native.
He is going to stay with us.
Make his room ready.
- Dear...
- Come.
Come dear!
What were doing my dear without me?
- Mr. Naushad!
- You?
I understand your pain.
I felt the pain in me when I knew that...
...my son is going away from me.
I thought that my son's life
has come to an end!
I got him back only
because of Sandhya.
He was playing with
his friends, flying kites!
All of a sudden he fell unconscious.
Doctor! You've to save his life somehow.
You know that well.
What he has is Cardiomyopathy!
Any moment,
his heart beats could stop.
We have to take his heart
away and fit another one!
I want my son.
I have informed all hospital.
Don't worry Naushad!
You can be happy about something!
There is a heart enlargement
for your son.
So, it is not necessary that
it need not be a boy's heart.
Anyone dead not before 4 hours...
...with a healthy heart and
B positive blood is enough
That will be suitable for him.
She is the donor.
If that incident didn't happen at all...
...his birthday will be on the
same day on the day he died.
My son has been
born again for me.
At this juncture
I wonder if I should be
happy that I got my son back...
...or solace for your loss!
We live in your girl's loss!
There are no words
to tell my thanks to you!
I want to see Iman.
With purple T-shirt!
Look there!
We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats
We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it
It should hit the target if hits,
The sea should change if caught,
What we think will happen!
If pulled, the earth is in our hands
Blow the stick like the wind
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
Blow the stick like the wind!
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats
We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it
Placing the enemy in a straight line
We've to stand firm by holding the armour
Should make wave with a song,
We're the print of the earth,
Lightening tree has grown up,
Seed of fire in our hands,
We've got the desired boon...
...like a sweet rain in our heart,
Blow the stick like the wind
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
Blow the stick like the wind!
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
Clouds are darkening, it seems to rain
...and the wind is blowing,
Wind!
Mild mind!
Heart is jumping in longing
A net is weaved with nerves
Creating volcano out of mind's rage
You're the excess in every share,
Like a light flying saucer
Heavy heart is flying
I was like a cracked wall,
Now the crack have become flowers
Blow the stick like the wind
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
Blow the stick like the wind!
Our signature became
as a lightning in sky
We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats
We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it
Iman come!
I went to see you in your house.
And you seem to enjoy the elephant ride.
As Iman got bored
I thought we could go on a ride.
Tell him hai!
Which class you are in?
Tell him.
Look at me.
This is Doctor... MBBS, it's mine.
Take good care of it.
What Iman?
Ok. Sandhya too was like this.
I got used to it.
I'll call you definitely.
Ask him to talk when I call up.
Naushad!
What is going on here?
I thought you have
told me everything.
But you have hidden
something from me.
I don't who it was,
in the black Scorpio!
Why did the car try to hit you?
Don't tell me it was an accident.
If it was an accident,
why did it come again to hit Iman?
Naushad! Tell me what happened?
Iman, go and sit outside for a while.
That is my car!
A horrible accident has
happened in my life.
See in that drawer...
The memories are chasing me.
That second one...
I have lost my son!
He thought it was me who killed his son.
You should go through the pain I suffer!
He bought the same car
and is trying to kill me.
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll separate your son from you.
As I couldn't stand his torture, and told
the police. He was put in the lockup.
But his urge to kill didn't subdue.
I'll take Iman with me.
Don't think!
Iman is important
for me as he is to you.
Because my life depends on him.
I have lost Sandhya once.
I got her back because of him.
I won't lose her once again.
I will take good care of Iman!
- Won't you talk?
- I won't.
- What is in the bag?
- Nothing.
Then keep it away and feel free.
Look there.
There is an elephant.
What problem do you have at this age?
I was joyful at your stage.
Sorry! I didn't expect you in this state.
Forgive me.
Where is your son?
I won't keep idle,
if anything happens to my son.
- That's what I'm going to do!
- Fool! That was an accident.
Your son has died in that accident.
My son has died.
It's you who tell that it is an accident.
Dad!
I was a very happy man!
You have snatched away my happiness.
You've injected pain in
my heart. Look at me.
Can you see the pain?
It won't be visible.
You can't see the pain.
You can only feel it.
I'm going to give you my pain!
You will come to know then.
He is a small boy.
My son?
Why are you keen to avenge?
I am not avenging.
I'll see if it is right...!
I'll make it equal!
I'll make it equal!
Do you think that I've killed your son?
Harm me in whatever way.
Leave my boy alone.
If I harm you...
...you wouldn't know the pain I suffer.
You have to undergo my pain.
I know well where your son is!
Come let's go inside.
- I'm not coming.
- Why?
I don't like this place.
Don't you like this place?
Ok, come with me.
I won't come in.
My name is Karthik. Come in!
I wouldn't come.
Ok. You be here.
Are you going to be here?
- Yes.
- Ok.
Come in if the wild elephant comes.
Wild elephant?
This is your room.
Bathroom is there.
There is a swing behind you.
Not there. This side!
- Are you feeling hungry?
- I am not hungry.
I feel hungry and I'm going to eat.
If you feel hungry,
You can come and have food.
Don't you feel hungry?
Come and sit here.
No.
Dear! What were you doing here?
You always play with sand.
Your hand is full of dirt.
What happened to the car?
It has hit on something!
It was a small accident.
Accident? How?
Was it a jeep?
Be careful! It is the hill station!
- Shall I get repaired your car?
- No.
- I'll make it ready in a day.
- No.
Pleasant air is blowing...
It's like music...
It is Ilayaraja's music!
Listen!
Dude! A.R. Rahman! Listen!
Dude! It is Ilayaraja's music! Listen!
A.R. Rahman's music! Listen!
I don't say that
A.R. Rahman's music is bad.
...but Ilayaraja's music is superb!
Listen!
I didn't say Ilayaraja's music is bad.
Listen!
Ilayaraja is a super star!
Listen to Ilayaraja first.
Don't touch!
You are quarrelling like a small boy.
Both of them are superb! Ok?
Listen to Ilayaraja first.
You can listen to A.R. Rahman next.
- If you don't change it, I'll get down
from the car. - Keep quiet!
I'll get down.
Wait.
What's your problem?
Do you want
to get down and walk?
Let me see how long
you can walk. Go!
The bag is in the back.
Take that too.
Close the door.
If you were not there,
I wouldn't have found him out so fast.
Who are you and what connection
you have with him?
I don't want to know that.
- Send him to me.
- No.
You have no connection with him!
You can go.
Go man.
Send him first to me.
I am in agony!
You don't know what is inside me.
I know. It is the vengeance
and foolishness, right?
It is not foolishness!
It is the pain!
The pain of a loss!
You wouldn't know that.
You would come to know it
if you were a loser like me.
I know well what is the pain of a loss.
It should not happen to anybody.
- Get away.
- He should have thought it over.
- He didn't do that.
- Don't talk like a fool.
The thought of vengeance will kill you!
Don't look for your own death. Go
- I've died long before.
- Do you know what you are talking about?
You are talking about
snatching away a soul.
Don't do that.
Forget it.
I have lost my son.
No. I'm talking about you,
snatching a life.
It is easy to take a life away.
In reality, it is different.
Imagination and reality
are different. Understand it.
I am living in the pain of reality.
You haven't understood
my pain so far.
When I see him, I could see joy
and smile on his dad's face.
I am not able to stand that.
- Leave him to me.
- No Easwar.
- Leave him.
- No.
Iman! Get into the car.
Fasten the seat belt.
What's going on here?
Who was in the black car?
Who was that hitting you?
Don't tell me it is an accident again.
Why did you come to Munnar?
Don't try to hide away things from me.
I will help you if you need any.
You have done many things for me.
Tell me what happened!
My son has died.
He was killed.
Do you know what have you done?
You will feel bad in your mind.
Why are you doing it?
You will get into problems!
If anything happens to you
who is there to take care of you?
We can do one thing.
I don't know how to tell it.
I know some people in this place.
We can finish our work through them.
Our names will not come out.
What? Leave it to me.
I'll take care.
I'll get sleep only when the light is on.
I am telling it on your safety!
You know what happened in
the morning. Go and sleep well.
When I was with my dad
there were no problems!
After I came with you
there were lots of problems!
- I want to go to my dad.
- I'll take you. Go to sleep.
You...
My bag.
You are keeping an eye on your bag.
I switched the light off to avoid
anyone taking it away. Lie down.
Ok!
Our boys did their work neatly.
They have dabbed poison on him.
He will definitely die.
There is a boy right?
You didn't tell me that.
I have not asked you
any help for me!
Not that. I wanted to help you
when you are in agony.
But after hearing that I felt that
if I have done some thing wrong.
Because we have a boy in this house.
Whatever it is I feel as if he
has been separated from his dad.
- You too don't know about my pain.
- I didn't mean it.
How will you feel if your son
is separated from you?
My bag!
- Karthik! -What?
- Where is my bag?
- It is in the car.
- Why?
We've to get away from here soon.
Get ready.
What happened?
Have you fallen down?
That's why I told you not
to switch off the light.
I should have handed you over to them.
It's nothing. Come fast.
How did you come so fast?
Didn't you take your bath?
You asked me to come fast.
You...! I pity on your dad
Raja! Look for him!
- Raja!
- Dad!
Dad!
Raja come here!
Where have you gone?
- I've to go.
- Where to?
Iman! Hold it.
Come.
Come.
Come Iman.
Here it is. Keep it.
Keep it.
- What is this?
- Have you seen Rambo?
Won't you see any action films?
You have many problems!
Isn't someone trailing you?
Fight them! Don't run away!
You have a strong body, right?
Look! Don't go anywhere
leaving me! Understand!
- Go and bring your bag!
- You too don't sleep like this.
Don't think that
I am doing everything for you!
I'm being patient only
because of her. Come.
Iman! Look here.
- Are you the one who has brought the boy?
- Yes doctor!
- Are you his dad?
- No, his guardian!
Have you done any by pass
surgery for the boy?
No! We have done heart
transplantation for him.
- How can you take him out like this?
- Doctor! Is there any problem in it?
There is no problem in that. As the boy
is little weak, he fell unconscious!
We have put him on drips!
He will be okay soon. Take care.
- What Rambo? How are you?
- See this.
Karthik! Where is my bag?
- Do you know what
the doctor has said? - What?
...that you are a weakling,
and that you have no strength!
...and that's why you fell down suddenly.
So, from tomorrow on,
you have to eat well.
...and take care of your health well.
Especially this has to be
taken good care.
- I want to go to my dad.
- I'll take you.
- When?
- Tomorrow!
- Definitely?
- I'll take you!
- Write it and sign it then.
- What?
Write that you will take me
to my dad and sign it.
Nothing will happen to you!
I'll take you to your dad tomorrow.
Then write it & sign it.
- Where?
- Here.
My dad never keeps his promises.
Now, you have given me
a promise. Let's see.
- I can't walk.
- It's only little more far. Come!
Go, Iman.
Iman, go!
Iman! Go away from here.
Go! See You Again!!!
