[Granny] What would you recommend
that I'd really like?
[manager] Uh, this.
[Granny] And this one, right here.
- Mm-hm.
- And a salad, I think.
[manager] Of course.
Oh! Ah.
[Chuck grunts]
- [manager] Hello. Welcome.
- Huh?
Have you a reservation, sir?
[chuckles]
Uh! Um, Gra... Grace, under...
- [Grace grunts, sighs]
- [Chuck groans]
Right on time.
[chuckles]
- [manager] Uh-huh.
- He's not here yet?
I have a reservation under Grace.
[manager] Uh...
Um, hmm.
Uh-huh? Hmm?
- [Chuck groans]
- Mm?
Uh, really nice to meet you.
Ah, and it's nice to meet you.
[chuckles]
[rain pattering]
[Grace] Declared missing
from a shipwrecked ocean liner,
only to return alive
after five-and-a-half years
on a desert island.
[chuckles]
Ever since I first read your story,
I've been dying to turn it into a book.
Thanks for being here.
You're way more handsome
in real life than in your pictures.
[spits, coughs]
- [Grace] You haven't had lunch yet, right?
- Uh...
Um, not yet.
That's good. I ordered ahead for us.
[Chuck] Oh. Uh, thank you.
Let's just cover the basics
while we're waiting for our lunch to come.
Is it all right if I record?
[Chuck] Yeah, it's okay.
- [recorder clicks]
- Right.
How have you been since your return?
Busy, I guess.
Adjusting to city life again
has been a little rough.
Has it, now?
Oh! Are there strange habits
that you can't break
from your life in the wild,
like capturing and eating pets,
or running around town
with only a spear and a loincloth?
[gasps]
Uh, no.
Not like that at all.
It's just it hasn't been easy
being around this many people.
[gasps, sighs]
Yes, of course.
Well, I really appreciate
you doing this interview.
I had heard you were turning down
everybody that asked for one.
Well, I've been rather torn about that.
I've been worried that no one
would believe what I've been through,
not all of it.
But there are some
remarkable little creatures
that the world should hear about.
"Remarkable creatures"?
But weren't you stranded
on the island all alone?
[sighs deeply]
I was alone, and yet I wasn't.
I discovered some special friends.
What kind of special friends?
Sounds pretty mysterious.
- [Chuck] After the ship went down...
- Hm?
I floated in a ducky tube
until I spotted an island.
A desert island so small,
it took five steps to walk
from one end of it to the other.
[sighs deeply]
[Chuck] And after six long months
alone on the island,
something happened.

The bugs couldn't be real, though.
- [Chuck] Pretty hard to believe.
- Huh?
I get that.
Truth is, I didn't believe it
at first, either.
Being stranded on an island
with weird little bugs like them.
[shudders]
- [keyboard clacking]
- Uh...
Oh, could you describe again
how the bugs looked?
Plus, did you name them?
Names, huh?
Yes, of course.
The red one who's always
ticked off is Red.
And the stretched-out
long one's name is Yellow.
- [Grace] Yellow.
- And together, I called them...
- I called them Larva.
- [Grace] Larva.
Uh, yes!
There were two bugs, and he called them...
- [Chuck] Oh, hang on there.
- Huh?
There weren't just two.
There was a third.
[Grace] A third bug?
[Chuck] Yeah.
A primitive one living in the jungle.
Like a cave bug or bug Tarzan.

Turns out bugs are just like

Hmm, uh...
[laughs]
Uh...
Um...
[chuckles]
I see that you don't believe me either.
Hey, I really don't not believe you.
Unexplainable stuff happens
all the time in this world.
[Grace] Just the fact
that you were stranded
and came back is an incredible story.
Yeah, well, guess that's true.
Um, then it was you and these three bugs
stuck on the island together
the whole time?
Well, no.
It wasn't just me and the bugs.

This is some tale.
Bugs that act like little people
and a singing seal?
What comes next?
Does an alien visit the island in a UFO?

There was one there.

Hey, wait!
What kinds of things did you eat
on the island to survive?
It was hard.
I was hungry all the time.

They don't care if you caught them
fair and square!
Uh, right.

Wow!
[Chuck] I am one with this fish.
Yes! Smack me with your life force!
But there's deeper flavor.
True treasure!
Felt only in a humpback whale's

Yes! The fabled rainbow clam!
The entire island plate.

Can you tell us about Larva

[narrator] The life of a pollack fish.
After the narrow escape,
the pollack's relief is short-lived
for there are countless dangers
that lurk in the ocean.
However, in the fierce struggle
for survival with its natural enemies,
the pollack has become
stronger and smarter.
Our pollack turns out to be a female.
With spawning season upon her,
many males begin their overtures.
The flashy movements of one male
are eye-catching.
The female pollack is interested.
- So begins their pollack romance.
- [smooching]
[screams]
[narrator] First comes love.
And then, of course, comes...
a hundred thousand to a million
little fishy miracles.
And when the time comes,
they will leave their parents' embrace
to start a new journey in the vast world.
Like their parents, they must survive
many hardships and seek out a partner,
so that they may fill the world
with little miracles of their very own.
The life of a pollack fish.
Fin. The end.
- Wow! Awesome!
- [chef] For real?
Those bugs are like a phoenix
or something.
Yes, they are. Those little boogers
could survive any danger ever! Uh...
- [chuckles]
- [gasps]
[groans]
- Uh...
- Chuck.
Lots of people seem interested
in this story of yours.
It's the first time that's happened.
- [Wendy] Mister!
- Huh?
Please! Please keep telling us your story!
This is the best story I've heard
in my 84 years on Earth.
So true!
I'm dying to try some of that
tasty bug cuisine.
Mmm-mmm.
Your lunch is on me,
if you agree to tell us some more.
- Uh...
- [Grace] Chuck?
- Chuck!
- [gasps]
Are you all right with them hearing
the rest of the interview?
Uh... Mm-hm. You bet.
I'm really touched you all wanna hear
what I went through.
- [Grace] Uh...
- Yay!
Uh, um... Great! Good!
Hmm.
If I'm honest here,
this is hard to swallow.
It sounds like a fantasy movie.
And you haven't heard the half of it.
I haven't even gotten to the crazy stuff.
[ominous music]
- [Chuck humming]

Hmm.
[Chuck] I'm sorry for acting so mean.

Uh! It was a force of habit.

[chef sobbing]
[clears throat]
So you're telling us you shared a bond
with your bug buddies?
Yeah.
But not just my bug buddies.
With Clara, Booby, Crabsformer.
Mudskippers as well.
We were trying

Daddy's here, darling.
Is it gonna storm?
Looks like we're in
for some temperamental weather.
Weather.
The weather on the island
was absolutely cuckoo.
Either burning hot or freezing cold.
[Chuck] Freak tornadoes
would rip up out of nowhere.

I wouldn't believe it myself.
[Grace sighs]
But I promise it's true.
- But that's bizarre.
- True that.
Awesome sauce!
[Granny] Any of them
wear glasses, you think?
[manager] Darnedest thing I ever heard.
Um, so, then, tell us
how you got off the island.
- Yeah!
- [gasps]
- Yeah.
- Tell us how you escaped!
Yes, do that!
- [Grace grunts]
- Did a boat come along?
- Did you swim across the ocean?
- Huh?
Get home.
That's what I was thinking
the whole time I was there.
[Chuck] But I failed to escape
so many times.
- I don't even know how many rafts I made.
- Hmm.
- [Chuck] But, one day...
- Uh?
...something happened
that meant we had to leave the island.

To ending this after all the suffering.

I thought if I just got off the island,
then I'd be fine.
God, are you gonna end me this way?

[gasps]
[plane engine revs]
Am I back?
I'm really back!
- [tires screech]
- Huh?
[door squeaks]
Uh?
Then I said farewell to everyone
and I was alone.
Uh, but still, you at least were able
to return home safely.
[sighs]
Yeah.
But I lost the family I found there.
[Wendy whimpers]
I wonder if they're all all right.
Mister, don't worry at all.
I'm sure your little bug friends
are safe and happy somewhere.
- [giggles]
- Mm-hm.
- Just like you are.
- [manager chuckles]
- [chef] They've gotta be.
- [all chuckle]
[manager] You said yourself
they never die.
- [Wendy] They're strong.
- [Granny] We're right, you know.
Yes, you are.
They're remarkably strong.
And they keep on smiling, no matter what.
Yay, bugs!
[giggles]
Go on.
Please tell us other adventures
you had with Larva.
Ooh! Larva! Larva! Larva!
[Wendy] Best story ever!
Yeah, all right.
I'll tell you about the time
me and Larva went shark fishing.
- [Wendy] Yay!
- [gasps, chuckles]
We got stuck right in a big
humpback whale's blowhole.
- [Chuck] Oh, the smell.
- [all laughing]
[laughs]
- [rain pattering]
- [all laughing]
[calm music]
[Grace and Chuck chuckling]
Oh, it cleared up.
[door closes]
Oh?
[Wendy and manager laughing]
[manager] It's been great.
Come back anytime.
- [Chuck] Thank you!
- [Wendy] Bye, silly man.
- [Chuck] Oh, bye, Wendy!
- [manager] Silly.
Well, that was certainly something else.
I guess it was.
- I don't remember having a nicer talk.
- Uh...
Thanks very much for talking to me today.
Sure, not a problem.
I thank you.
I realized today it's not as important
everyone believe me as I thought it was.
As long as I still remember my friends,
I'll remember it's all true.
[Chuck] Whether people believe
it all really happened,
well, that's up to them.
I finally truly feel like
I've completely left the island behind.
[chuckles]
Mm, uh...
Well, we're happy to have you back, Chuck.
Thanks very much, Grace.
I won't forget your help. Ever.
[sighs]
[calm music]
[Grace] To be honest,
when I first heard his story,
I thought he was a big, lying liar pants.
Even now, I'm still not sure
I believe all of it.
But I've written this book
with the earnest hope
that everyone will hear
of his amazing experiences,
and the special friends
he made on the island.
And I hope people enjoy my writing too.
[sighs]
[Grace] Could it all be hooey in bunk?
Everyone who heard Chuck's
brave, intense story,
- myself included...
- [Wendy giggles]
[Grace] ...felt almost transported
to the island themselves.
It was clearly real to Chuck.
- And frankly...
- Huh?
- [groans]
- ...that's good enough for this writer.
[Grace] I hope it's real
to all who read this book as well.
[dramatic music]
- [gasps]
- [phone buzzes]
- [Chuck] Oh, Clara.
- [coin clinks]
[Chuck] Oh, no, no. I just left.
- Yes.
- [coin clinks]
- Hang on.
- [muttering from distance]
Huh?
[light music]
Uh, yeah! I'm still here.
Sure. I'll be right there.
I love you too.
[light music]
