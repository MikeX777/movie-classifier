 ZORRO AT THE COURT OF ENGLAND
 Manuel Garcia is accused of
 having aroused, by his talks
 and his writings, the people
 of Hamilton
 and of having incited them
 to revolt.
 By virtue of his powers,
 the Governor of the Island,
 Sir Basil Ruthford,
 sentences the accused
 to death by hanging.
 One day, they will have
 to pay for this.
 This is the third in a month.
 Sooner or later, it will be our turn.
 Manuel ! Manuel !
 It's time for us to revolt !
 Everyone !
 We must rebel !
 No-one can do anything
 against these tyrants.
 Damn you all ! Assassins !
 Damn you all !
 Execute him !
 Replace the rope.
 Your Excellency !
 May I point out to you
 that, according to tradition, if a
 condemned man escapes death,
 for any reason like this one,
 he is granted his freedom.
 You dare question my orders ?
 Sergeant, shoot
 the condemned man
 where he stands.
 Quickly !  Stop him !
 Shut the gate, quickly !
 Manuel !
 Courage, Maria.
 I will be back !
 Captain, what are you doing
 standing there ? Get moving !
 Rest assured,
 he will not escape me.
 Follow me !
 Idiots ! Cretins !
 You have let him get away.
 The next time,
 I will get him for sure !
 What are you doing standing there ?
 Get moving !
 Curses upon him !
 Down there, a ship awaits you.
 It will take you to England.
 Explain what is happening here.
 Tell the Queen she is poorly
 represented on this island.
 I will spread the news,
 you can rely on me.
 I will do all I can to talk
 with the Queen.
 But I would like to know your name
 and see your face
 So I may properly express
 my gratitude to you.
 Time presses, you must go.
 When justice and liberty
 once again triumph on this island,
 I will reveal my name to you.
 For the moment, I can only
 tell you that I am called
 Zorro !
 The entire population remain
 loyal to Your Majesty,
 and support your efforts
 in advancing the prosperity
 and well-being of this country.
 But the harassment and abuse
 instigated by Your Majesty's
 current representative
 serve only to exasperate
 the people.
 The Judges are biased firmly
 behind the Governor
 and only listen to the witnesses
 for the prosecution.
 The convicted serve their
 sentences in the Clinton mines.
 The few prisoners who
 survive the harsh work,
 are held in a cave, chained
 like beasts.
 It is because of this
 that a brave and worthy man,
 known only by the name of
 Zorro,
 and to whom I owe my life,
 has rallied the people
 in the hope of finally seeing
 the triumph of justice.
 But it is difficult
 to check a revolt once
 it has been triggered.
 And this rogue Governor
 risks compromising the loyal
 respect that your subjects
 feel towards England.
 I urge you to intervene
 without delay.
 We will do so, if your report
 to us is confirmed.
 Your Majesty,
 may I suffer the severest of
 your punishments
 should you find that I have lied.
 We cannot condemn one
 of our Governors
 simply on the basis of rumour
 and one isolated denunciation.
 But if the situation proves
 to be as you say,
 Governor Basil Ruthford
 will be recalled and dealt
 with severely,
 and he will be replaced by one
 who better represents
 the law and order we demand.
 As for your ghostly hero ...
 What did you call him ?
 Zorro.
 While we may well admire
 his audacity and courage,
 we are forced to consider
 his exploits,
 however well-intentioned,
 as completely illegal.
 No-one has the right to take
 the law into his own hands.
 Zorro considers himself
 an outsider
 and not answerable to
 England's statutes.
 We shall see about that.
 Your Majesty,
 if you will excuse us.
 The Privy Council requests
 your permission
 to enter.
 You may go, Senor Garcia.
 Have no fear.
 Justice will be done.
 It was with that certainty
 in my mind
 that I came to address
 Your Majesty.
 General Kingston, allow the
 Privy Council to enter.
 Gentlemen...
 Be seated.
 The Privy Council has been
 convened to discuss
 a trade agreement
 with Denmark, and ...
 My Lord Privy Seal, you will
 excuse me for interrupting
 but, before we talk about the
 trade agreement with Denmark,
 I would like to submit to the
 judgment of the Privy Council
 a report that has troubled
 me profoundly.
 One of our subjects, a native
 of one of our colonies,
 the Island of Hamilton,
 in the Bermudas,
 has told me of
 a desperate situation
 developing in this colony
 as the result of the harassment
 and abuse
 that the Governor is undertaking
 both in our name,
 and in the name of England.
 I might humbly observe that
 cases where
 subjects are dissatisfied
 with their government are legion.
 And that, very often,
 their motives are
  strictly personal.
 This man miraculously escaped
 his own execution that was
 decreed by the Governor.
 Rather than flee,
 he decided to come to England,
 to ask for justice for himself
 and for his country,
 declaring he was ready to be
 punished if he has lied.
 Might I ask
 who is this Governor ?
 Sir Basil Ruthford.
 Before settling this matter,
 we want to know the truth
 about conditions on this island.
 The Privy Council must send
 one of its senior members,
 who will prepare for me
 a detailed status report.
 And so, who among you,
 is willing
 to face the difficulties
 and possible dangers
 of a voyage such as this ?
 I am, Your Majesty.
 You, Lord Moore ?
 I came to this role
 by right of succession
 and I have not yet been able
 to prove to Your Majesty
 my dedication and loyalty.
 I am pleased
 to take this opportunity.
 I thought the role of guardian
 to your nephew and niece
 was the closest to your heart ?
 Young William Scott is now
 attending Royal Military College.
 I can therefore hardly
 do more for his education.
 As for Patricia Scott,
 she is a girl who is full of life
 and she would be delighted
 to accompany me
 upon this trip.
 That being the case ...
 - Admiral Britt.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.
 Place one of your vessels
 at the disposal of Lord Moore.
 As quickly as possible.
 Now let us turn to the trade
 agreement with Denmark ....
 Milady, according to your Uncle,
 one boat is not enough
 to carry all your baggage.
 It will require the entire
 Fleet of Her Majesty.
 - So, I must restrain myself ?
 - Just so, MiIady.
 I have always wanted
 to go on a long trip,
 to see new places.
 Well, I can understand you
 wanting to see Paris or Rome,
 but Hamilton ....
 Rome and Paris are so close.
 I will have lots of opportunities
 in my life to visit them.
 Why such a sad face ?
 This will be our first time apart.
 Do you think I will love you
 less, little brother ?
 No, but what will I do on a Sunday,
 if you aren't there to greet me ?
 You must write to me,
 and I will do the same.
 On my return, we will each read
 all that has been written.
 The only good thing in all this
 is that Uncle is also leaving.
 I won't have to see him anymore
 and I won't have to answer
 his insufferable questions.
 ''Well then, my boy, how are things ?
 ''Are you behaving as appropriate
 for the heir to a great name ?
 ''Do you recall - the boy is the
 father of the man?''
 - Can't you bear it ?
 - No.
 I am afraid that
 reports of your sea voyage
 have not been taken well.
 What is your judgment ?
 The situation is critical.
 Your creditors are likely
 to create a scandal.
 You must do something
 to prevent it.
 I cannot perform miracles.
 You forget, it seems, that
 our last business together
 netted you a handsome profit.
 I have not forgotten, and
 I am grateful to you. But ...
 But the situation today is
 more serious than ever.
 My niece Patricia is young
 and quite charming.
 There are already suitors
 at my door.
 What if I am faced with
 a proposal of marriage
 that I cannot refuse ?
 What can I possibly say to this
 future husband ?
 That Patricia Scott, instead of
 being a rich heiress,
 doesn't have a farthing
 to her name,
 because I have squandered
 her fortune ?
 The laws in England are
 very severe in such cases.
 For me, it would be the end.
 By taking her away with me,
 I am removing that danger.
 Also, this trip to Hamilton
 provides me a useful ally.
 Sir Basil Ruthford, the Governor,
 is a good friend of mine.
 I understand.
 But how can we deal with
 the current crisis ?
 Sell the properties in Sheffield.
 Sheffield ? The last remaining
 properties of the children !
 I will make sure they are
 no longer required.
 Milady...
 Cadet William Scott,
 your free period is over.
 We must go.
 Goodbye, Patricia.
 Return soon.
 Zorro... Zorro... Zorro !
 I hear that name,
 from everyone I meet.
 And now, from you as well.
 Yes, from me. Of course.
 Zorro isn't just a name,
 he is a myth.
 A myth ?
 A bandit, a common outlaw.
 When he falls into my hands,
 he won't look so alluring,
 swinging from the gallows !
 What if you should fail,
 and word of his exploits
 reaches England ?
 England is far away.
 And the English have better
 things to do
 than concern themselves
 about this island
 In your place, I wouldn't be
 so cocksure.
 When I first knew you,
 you were poor.
 but I loved you as much
 as I do now.
 Let's leave for a remote
 part of the world
 where we can live modestly
 together.
 Rosanna, you are a woman.
 You cannot understand.
 Do you think I could go
 back to the sort of life
 we first led here, having
 grown used to this ?
 I love the money, yes,
 but I love the power above all.
 You are ignoring
 the elation that I feel
 as I order around these
 beggars who hate me
 but fall at my feet
 because they fear me.
 - Who is it ?
 - Captain Wells.
 With urgent and important news.
 One moment, Captain.
 Go, I beg you.
 Do you believe no-one knows
 of our relationship ?
 It's better if we maintain
 appearances.
 They can be maintained later.
 Come in, Captain Wells.
 Well, Captain ?
 Excellency, a dispatch has
 arrived from Port Combley.
 An English vessel has arrived
 unexpectedly.
 Lord Moore has disembarked,
 accompanied by a young woman,
 his niece, I understand.
 They have hired a carriage
 and are coming here.
 Percy Moore ?
 What are you waiting for ?
 Take a detachment
 and go and meet them.
 Convey to them my welcome.
 I never thought there
 could be so much sun.
 Now we can forget
 the fogs of London, Patricia.
 Who are those men ?
 Why are they treated that way ?
 They are traitors.
 They disobeyed the orders
 of the Governor.
 What is it now ?
 Quickly !
 Throw out your gun
 and get down.
 Welcome to Hamilton, Lord Moore.
 You have just passed
 a column of prisoners.
 Those sorry people
 were once happy citizens.
 But...
 they could no longer afford
 to pay the arbitrary taxes
 imposed by the Governor.
 Sir Basil Ruthford, invoking a
 law that he himself imposed,
 confiscated their property
 and reduced them to slavery.
 They now toil for
 a mouthful of bread
 and a filthy mattress of straw.
 The people know that the
 Queen has heard of this abuse
 and has sent you, Lord Moore,
 to inspect the colony.
 We are hopeful that
 you will bring a halt to what is
 happening here. Otherwise...
 Otherwise ?
 Otherwise, by the word of Zorro,
 I will enforce justice.
 And you will return to England,
 bearing my trademark :
 the Z that is my initial.
 Will you also submit me
 to the same treatment ?
 No.
 On a face as beautiful as yours,
 I could not use the sword.
 I will draw the Z,
 but with a flower.
 Goodbye !
 Quickly ! That way !
 Down there !
 Quickly, let's pursue him !
 Amazing, unbelievable !
 Such banditry in one of
 Her Majesty's colonies !
 To think that my friend Ruthford
 is unable to prevent
 such things happening.
 It is hardly surprising, Milord,
 given the sight we had
 of those poor prisoners.
 What are you saying,
 you are impertinent !
 I advise you to hold your tongue.
 Good day, Milady.  Milord.
 Has something happened ?
 I am Pedro Suarez,
 and the surrounding land is mine.
 Did you see the soldiers
 - pursuing a masked man ?
 No. May I ask to whom I have
 the honour of speaking ?
 Lord Percy Moore,
 envoy of
 Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.
 This is my niece, Patricia Scott.
 We were heading to the
 Governor's home, when Zorro,
 threatened us.
 Zorro ?
 I thought this Zorro was a
 figment of popular legend.
 I can assure you, Senor Suarez,
 we saw him with our own eyes.
 In that case, I accept your assurance.
 Nothing, he disappeared.
 Captain Wells, at the service
 of the Governor.
 In short, Captain, you have
 allowed him to escape.
 Excuse me, Captain, but why have
 you arrested my servant Pedrito ?
 Ah, he is your servant ?
 You surely don't think that
 Zorro and Pedrito are one ?
 Free him !
 Lord Moore, when you wish.
 I have been ordered to escort
 you to the Palace.
 The precaution is now useless.
 But you can follow us if you like.
 Good day to you !
 If you will allow,
 I will come with you.
 If you wish.
 I will direct you.  I wish
 to prove to Lady Patricia
 that this land is not all
 chained prisoners
 and masked bandits.
 Pedrito, my horse !
 Follow me !
 And here we are, Lady Patricia.
 Rosanna will show you
 to your rooms
 which, I hope, will please you.
 Through the windows you
 can see the entire park.
 - As for yourself ...
 - Of little importance.
 If the ladies permit,
 we should talk, my dear Basil.
 It will be a great pleasure.
 A reunion with an old friend.
 I can't wait to get together,
 and reminisce about old times.
 If you will follow me, Lady Scott.
 Until later, Excellency.
 Although I am no longer
 a young man,
 I am still single.
 Rosanna Gonzalez manages
 the home,
 a task little suited to a man.
 A charming woman.
 Yes, this is quite true.
 Would you care for a whisky
 in my office ?
 Gladly.
 This is wonderful, Milady !
 The countryside is marvellous.
 - Are you not happy ?
 - I'm not sure.
 When we left the ship,
 I was happy
 but since then - those men
 in chains and that masked man
 have left me a little troubled.
 Pedro Suarez also - he
 troubled you.
 He seemed to me to be
 devouring you with his eyes !
 I can't say the same
 of his servant Pedrito.
 Ah, he is a nice boy.
 Try this whisky. It is 15 years old.
 Tip-top.
 It's best that I let you know
 straightaway
 the reasons for my presence here.
 The Queen has heard some
 unflattering things
 about the way you govern here.
 I know.
 It's said I have an iron fist,
 that I am a tyrant,
 that I oppress the population.
 Please understand me.
 The Queen is still very young,
 and rather overenthusiastic
 in handling her grave duties.
 But, given time,
 she will come to appreciate
 that Empire can be maintained
 only with force.
 Then, you do not disapprove
 of my approach ?
 No, not at all.
 As long as it is not used to
 enhance your personal fortune.
 I don't understand you.
 This whisky is truly exceptional.
 We were very close in our
 younger days, Basil,
 and we know each other's
 strengths and weaknesses.
 When the Queen called
 for this inspection,
 I immediately put myself forward.
 ''Can my friend Basil really
 have committed such a
 sin ?", I asked myself.
 I thought it would be better
 if I were to come here,
 rather than any other.
 For example,
 General Kingston.
 Kingston, you say ?
 The adviser most listened to
 by Her Majesty.
 The men in chains, and the
 presence of Zorro, would have
 given him a clear enough idea
 of the true situation here.
 Perhaps you would already be
 on your way back to England,
 under the cloud of a serious charge.
 Then it only remains for me to
 thank you, Sir Percy
 and fervently to wish that
 our old friendship
 be renewed by fresh
 commonalities of interest.
 That is my wish also.
 Excuse me, Milady.
 For Milady Patricia Scott.
 A gift from my master,
 Don Pedro Suarez.
 With this.
 These are for you, from me.
 Without a note, because I do
 not know how to write.
 Read it to me.
 ''Now the flowers of Hamilton
 ''know that there is another
 more lovely than they
 ''and they bow to your beauty.
 ''Pedro Suarez.''
 Ah, such a beautiful sentiment !
 Louisa,
 one should never trust the
 amorous words of men.
 It is not true.  It is a lie.
 I wanted to defend the
 honour of my daughter.
 But I didn't shoot.
 I didn't shoot !
 What you are saying is false.
 Mind what you say, Cortez,
 and respect this Tribunal, which
 has the honour of welcoming
 the Special Envoy from
 Her Majesty, The Queen.
 Conduct yourself calmly,
 and we will give you justice.
 It is true.
 I kept some writings in my home
 of Manuel Garcia, knowing
 that it was prohibited.
 When the soldiers came to search,
 I immediately agreed to co-operate.
 But one soldier,
 in spite of my pleading,
 abused my daughter
 with words and gestures
 that would incense every father.
 I intervened.
 But he resisted me.
 His colleague, wishing to
 defend him, fired at me.
 But the bullet hit my opponent.
 I am speaking the absolute truth.
 Ask my daughter if what I say
  is not what happened
 The Tribunal does not accept
 the testimony of relatives.
 Then, believe me !
 I swear before God that
 I have spoken the truth !
 - Believe me.
 - Have Captain Wells enter.
 Captain Wells !
 Do you swear to tell the truth,
 the whole truth, and
 nothing but the truth.
 Say, "I swear".
 I swear.
 Captain Wells, without reading
 what is written here,
 do you confirm your testimony
 made in this statement ?
 Excuse me, Excellency.
 Without wishing to interfere,
 it is my duty
 to know exactly what
 Captain Wells has said.
 Speak, Wells.
 The accused is wrong
 to claim I had any involvement.
 In fact, he could not even
 have seen me there.
 I was coming through the door,
 just preparing to intervene,
 but I was too slow.
 Before I could act,
 the accused had grabbed
 a gun from one of my men
 and killed his opponent.
 No, that isn't true !
 It isn't true !
 It's a lie ! A lie ! A lie !
 Silence !
 Silence !
 Or I will clear the Court.
 It is a falsehood, sir.
 The Captain was in the tavern.
 He played cards at my table.
 - You are sure ?
 - Certain.
 Why did you say nothing ?
 I have a wife and children.
 They wouldn't let me.
 What about you ?
 Me ? My only concern is
 for a peaceful life.
 What if you appealed to Zorro ?
 He is more capable than I
 in handling this sort of thing.
 Silence !
 Silence !
 You can step down, Captain.
 Excellency.
 The Prosecution has the floor.
 This crime is punishable
 by death,
 but, given the particular
 provocation in this case,
 I call for the sentence to be
 commuted to forced labour
 for perpetuity.
 The Defence has the floor.
 The Defence has the floor !
 I call for clemency of the Court.
 Silence !
 In the name of Her Britannic
 Majesty, Queen Victoria,
 given the findings of this trial
 which prove the culpability
 of the accused
 I sentence Francisco Cortez
 to forced labour for perpetuity.
 He will serve his sentence
 in the mines of Clinton,
 where he will be transferred
 without any delay.
 Silence !
 The mines of Clinton ?
 I'd rather be killed than that !
 Assassins !
 Assassins !
 Guards, clear the Court !
 Assassins !
 Assassins !
 I am sorry, Lord Moore,
 But you must see the necessity
 to deal severely
 with these people.
 I understand.
 To make amends,
 I intend to organise
 tomorrow at the Palace
 a ball in your honour, and
 that of your niece.
 Thank you.
 Do you accept the challenge ?
 Certainly.
 Good fortune, Captain !
 You have brought me luck !
 Nobody move !
 It was your false testimony
 that condemned an innocent man
 to forced labour.
 I could kill you.
 But I am giving you the chance
 to defend yourself.
 Just the two of us !
 I let you keep your life,
 but this indelible sign will be
 the mark of your infamy.
 Each time that I see you again,
 I will add others to it !
 Stay where you are !
 Grab him ! There he goes !
 It's Zorro ! We've taken him !
 Let me go ! Release me,
 you cretins ! Cretins !
 Louisa !
 - Well, will you come ?
 - I don't know.
 Milady may have need of me.
 No, I don't think so.
 I will wait for you in a half-hour.
 Very well.
 I imagine that, in London,
 the waltz is very popular.
 Here,
 we are just being introduced to it.
 My word, Lady Patricia, it is
 the truth, you dance divinely.
 May I also have the honour
 of dancing with you ?
 Please.
 Everyone has noted the attention
 you have shown to that young lady.
 A diplomatic obligation, my dear.
 I must keep on good terms
 with her guardian.
 Ah yes, really ?
 You don't seem to find it
 too distasteful.
 Rosanna, believe me,
 do not concern yourself with
 matters that do not affect you.
 Be careful in what you're
 doing, Basil.
 You cannot set me aside so easily.
 May I take her from you ?
 With pleasure, Milord.
 Lady Patricia, may we take a
 few moments in the garden ?
 Yes, willingly.
 I dance rather badly,
 and I think a bit of fresh air
 will do us both good.
 It is stifling inside.
 What a beautiful starry sky !
 There are two things that
 never change here :
 the stars and the sun.
 You seem sad about that.
 Yes. Because here they cannot
 be enjoyed for their true value.
 And yet, when we first met,
 you seemed well content
 with your lot.
 Oh, I am;  but I would like my
 fellow man to feel the same.
 Yesterday morning, that poor
 Cortez was sentenced
 and was condemned
 to a terrible punishment.
 Last night, Zorro was boasting
 about what he would do to
 Captain Wells.
 Boasting ? A man who dares
 confront his enemies alone ?
 What ardour !
 So, you also share
 the admiration that everyone
 feels for Zorro ?
 I don't know much about
 the situation in this colony.
 It's a matter that concerns
 my Uncle, Lord Moore.
 But my intuition is that
 Zorro is fighting a just cause.
 I see.
 Now I will refrain from
 speaking about him.
 Lady Patricia,
 since you arrived,
 I have thought of nothing but you.
 I am stricken with a feeling
 that I can only describe
 as love, and ...
 I beg you, Don Suarez,
 do not go on.
 You Latins,
 you burn with passion,
 but, very often, your fire
 goes out as easily as it was lit.
 I will prove to you that
 you are wrong.
 At least, leave me with a hope.
 Shouldn't I be getting back ?
 - Lady Patricia ?
 - Not with me.
 I believe someone is looking
 for you.
 Dear Patricia,
 you promised me the next dance.
 Sr. Suarez was showing me the
 wonders of this fabulous country.
 Sr. Suarez is an excellent guide
 and an example to us all.
 If only all were like him, here !
 You permit me ?
 Are you coming ?
 No, thank you. As I told you,
 it is too hot inside.
 Your visit has delighted us.
 You fill this sad palace
  with the breath of youth.
 If my coming has provoked
 so much emotion,
 perhaps it would have been
 better if I'd stayed in England.
 Why ?
 Has someone been speaking
 to you in the same manner ?
 Nobody move !
 Lord Moore has been witness
 to a terrible injustice.
 An innocent man
 has been condemned.
 You can still prove
 that your coming here
 was not useless ....
 by arranging for the immediate
 release of Francisco Cortez.
 Otherwise, it will be myself
 who, tomorrow night,
 will free the prisoner !
 Don't shoot !
 Guards, catch him !
 Quickly, after him !
 Ow ! Ouch !
 What are you doing there ?
 Did you see Zorro ?
 - Yes.
 - Where is he ?
 He stunned me, he went that way.
 Guards ! Block the exits !
 Man all the gates !
 Louisa !
 What are you doing here ?
 I heard shooting.
 It's nothing. Just Zorro, as usual.
 What does that mean to us ?
 My mistress needs me..
 Some other time.
 - Stay here a while with me.
 - No.
 Louisa...
 - How are you, Milady ?
 - Better, thank you.
 It's over now, thank Heaven.
 Is it true, what that man said ?
 An innocent man was condemned
 and you let it happen ?
 Let's dance.
 May the party continue.
 I don't have any luck.
 Once more, I missed seeing
 the famous Zorro.
 I was taking the air,
 and got back too late.
 Perhaps you could have
 captured him ?
 That is not my responsibility.
 That's up to Captain Wells
 and his soldiers.
 So, Wells ?
 Nothing. He disappeared.
 As fleet of foot as always.
 Wells, he has scarred you again.
 If this keeps up,
 your face will resemble
 a map in an atlas.
 Patricia, will you dance ?
 Excuse us.
 Madame Rosanna ?
 I came to wish you a good night
 and to check that all the
 excitements of the evening
 didn't disturb you too much.
 I thank you for your
 thoughtfulness.
 This is the second time
 that I've seen Zorro
 and I must confess that
 I find him rather fascinating.
 You, Lady Patricia,
 fascinated by a bandit ?
 A bandit, perhaps.
 But, you must admit,
 he has courage.
 To defy the Governor in his
 own Palace,
 on his own, in spite of the guards !
 I understand.
 At your age, I also was
 easily enchanted
 by tales of adventure.
 And I wrapped myself
 inside my dreams.
 But then, over time,
 all my dreams have been dashed,
 and I have finished up,
 trapped on this island,
 far from the rest of the world.
 Aren't you happy here ?
 Happy ? Yes ...
 As much as a woman can be
 who keeps her eyes open
 and can see the face of reality.
 You have had a lot of success
 this evening, Patricia.
 I saw that Don Pedro was
 paying court to you.
 and also ... the Governor.
 They were all very pleasant
 towards me.
 But, take care, Lady Patricia.
 Beware of those who flatter you.
 Here, any novelty generates
 a lot of enthusiasm,
 but it doesn't last long.
 So, don't have too many illusions !
 Yes, but what do you mean ?
 I mean that it is rather dangerous
 to play games with the Governor.
 The Governor ?
 Don't play the innocent.
 Be aware that I am ready to
 defend, with all my power,
 the position I have gained for
 myself with pain and humiliation.
 But ...
 But I've done nothing.
 Of course not, Patricia.
 Excuse me.
 I do not want to make you cry.
 I want only ....
 to put you on your guard.
 You know, maybe I had a
 little too much to drink tonight.
 And I needed to unburden myself.
 It is good for women to confide
 with each other. Isn't it ?
 Though you are younger than I,
 I sense that we understand
 each other.
 Good night, Lady Patricia.
 And enjoy your dreams
 of adventure.
 No, don't be afraid.
 I want to talk with you.
 I refuse to listen to a bandit.
 I am not a bandit.
 You know I fight for a just cause.
 To free this colony from a tyrant
 and to release the innocents
 from our prisons.
 Do not believe what the friends
 of the Governor say of me.
 I would be very sad
 if you thought badly of me.
 Why does it matter
 what I think of you ?
 To know you believe in me
 would urge me to victory.
 - Lady Patricia !
 - You must go !
 Stay in your room tonight.
 I am coming to the Palace
 to rescue Cortez.
 No. They will capture you.
 There are guards everywhere.
 Goodbye.
 Patricia !
 Why have you not
 kept up with us ?
 We have been looking
 everywhere for you.
 My horse carried me
 in the wrong direction.
 We were enjoying the freedom
 of the gallop.
 That was unwise, my dear.
 Zorro is somewhere in this
 vicinity, according to reports.
 Imagine that,
 if you had met with him ?
 That man is capable of anything.
 Excellency,
 he is heading for the clearing.
 He is cornered, trapped !
 Then go, quickly !
 Go, return home !
 Go home !
 What are you doing ?
 Working !
 - Did you see Zorro ?
 - No, only his horse.
 Idiots !
 You have let him get away.
 You, search for him,
 and be quick !
 You, Sergeant. You will never
 get a promotion !
 All of you, down there !
 Search around the perimeter
 - from top to bottom !
 And you, get back to work !
 Search as far as you can !
 And keep your eyes about you !
 He must not escape us !
 Hurry up !
 Follow me !
 You, what are you doing there ?
 Get your cart out of here !
 There's nothing like an old port
 to finish a meal properly.
 Excellency,
 Captain Wells wishes to see you.
 Let him enter.
 Excellent, this port,
 truly excellent.
 I am happy that you like it.
 I had it brought from Lisbon.
 What is it, Captain ?
 Excellency,
 the main entrance is guarded.
 No-one can enter without
 a pass signed by me.
 3 patrols surround the grounds,
 as many are watching the park.
 Those who do not know
 the password will be arrested.
 It is absolutely impossible
 for Zorro,
 unless he has
 the gift of invisibility,
 to get into the Palace.
 And, even if he did get in,
 he would not get out alive.
 I cannot agree to that, Captain.
 Zorro, I want him alive.
 That would be the best execution
 we have ever seen in Hamilton.
 My compliments, Captain.
 This time, I am certain,
 you will repay Zorro for the
 humiliations he inflicted on you.
 I predict that his capture
 and execution
 will bring an end to this myth
 that has excited the more
 romantic amongst us.
 Excuse me, I feel tired.
 Please allow me to withdraw.
 I will accompany you, Milady.
 Return to your post.
 I will wait all night
 to hear the good news.
 Excellency,
 I assure you that, this time,
 he will not get away.
 Will you keep me company,
 Lord Moore ?
 I will take this opportunity
 to speak with you of a topic
 close to my heart.
 - Gladly.
 - After you.
 Get moving !
 Guards, halt !
 Left turn !
 Change the guard !
 Nice hand-over !
 Left turn !
 Forward, march !
 That's good, let's go.
 Five !
 Wait.
 Four !
 Are you not going to bed, Milady ?
 No, not yet.
 But you can go, if you wish.
 Thank you, Milady.
 It's said ...
 that the heart does not age.
 And I have experienced
 just that, in recent days.
 The continued presence
 of your niece
 has instilled in me a feeling,
 both sincere
 and profound, in this regard.
 I asked you to stay the night,
 so we might speak about this.
 Then, speak. Express yourself.
 Milord, I have the honour to
 request the hand of your niece.
 Lady Patricia Scott.
 Your request is a great honour.
 But I ask you to consider
 the young age of Patricia.
 And then ...
 And then ?
 And then, there are matters
 to be discussed,
 to be agreed, in detail.
 I do not expect less.
 We have the entire night
 ahead of us to do this.
 One, two ! One, two ! One, two !
 - Is all well ?
 - Yes.
 Louisa !
 My love !
 You stifled me. The gate !
 The patrol will see it.
 You are right.
 - Come on, let's go.
 - Where to ?
 - Down there.
 - I'm frightened, it's too dark.
 Precisely, let's go.
 We'd better put our cards on
 the table, my dear Basil.
 The few days I have spent here
 have confirmed what I suspected.
 Meaning ?
 You have governed this colony
 with terror,
 abusing your power to amass
 a huge personal fortune.
 I have sufficient evidence
 to write my report for the Queen...
 So...
 why don't you do it, then ?
 I have told you.
 I am your friend.
 We had decided to lay down
 our cards.
 Let's leave aside the
 declarations of friendship
 and get to the facts.
 Let me tell you what I know
 about you.
 You haven't a penny to your name.
 Gambling and women
 are your only passions.
 Passions that cost you dear.
 The Moore fortune has long
 been depleted,
 and, I understand, the fortune
 of the Scott children,
 which you were to control
 until their majority,
 is severely compromised.
 Continue. What you say is
 very interesting.
 That is almost everything,
 my dear friend.
 Send a report to the Queen
 favourable towards me
 and give your consent
 to my marriage with Patricia.
 Even without a dowry ?
 That's the point which will
 interest you the most.
 Because I will agree to marry
 Patricia without a dowry.
 At last, there you are !
 It's the fault of the women.
 Attention !
 - Has he gone ?
 - Yes.
 Let's go.
 This way.
 There is one last question,
 my dear Basil.
 Yes ?
 What is it ?
 This Rosanna Gonzalez,
 I sense that she is intimately
 linked with you.
 Will she not cause trouble ?
 Have no fear.
 At the right time,
 I will get rid of her.
 Let's go.
 How are things ?
 Let me see the prisoner.
 Hm, he seems a little sad.
 It can't be too cheerful
 being shut up in there.
 I must go.
 I have to make an inspection.
 Very well, off you go.
 'Bye. Take care, yes ?
 He is through there.
 Quickly !
 Zorro went through there !
 This way.
 Watch the prisoner.
 Zorro is in the prison.
 Zorro !
 Remove his uniform.
 - Have you seen him ?
 - No.
 Come with me.
 Secure all exits !
 - Have you seen Zorro ?
 - Idiot ! Why ask me ?
 To our agreement, Moore.
 Secure the exits !
 Zorro is in the Palace.
 Zorro !
 Idiots.
 Search for him,
 he can't get away !
 Back here again ?
 You, through there !
 Take a look.
 - This way.
 - You, follow me !
 Pedrito !
 Let's go.
 Come on !
 There he is.
 Get yourselves to safety.
 I will deal with them.
 Have you seen Zorro ?
 - He has escaped to the park.
 - Follow me !
 - What is going on ?
 - I don't know.
 Excellency !
 - Wells, what is happening ?
 - Zorro is in the Palace.
 By truth,
 this time he won't escape !
 Arrest him, and you will receive
 a promotion in rank !
 - Lieutenant !
 - At your command.
 - The Left Wing. I'll take this side.
 - Let's go.
 Halt !
 Throw down your sword !
 Hey, you two !
 Where are you going ?
 We're looking for Zorro.
 Go no further.
 Mount a guard here.
 - Yes, sir.
 - Forward !
 Stand your ground !
 This time, I have you.
 You shall not escape me.
 Throw down your sword !
 Stop him !
 You cannot escape from here !
 Stop !
 Out of the way ! Let me shoot him !
 Get out of the way !
 - Push him off !
 - Give that to me !
 Untangle yourself !
 Capture him ! Capture him !
 Quickly !
 You, that way !
 Come with me !
 Wells, secure all the exits !
 Quickly !
 Zorro !
 This way ! Look on the roof !
 You, that way !
 Search the rooms.
 Well, Captain Wells ?
 Have no fear, we'll get him.
 Then, go. And do it quickly !
 Patricia !
 Hide in here.
 Lady Patricia, open up !
 Yes, I am coming.
 What is it ?
 Excuse me,
 but Zorro is inside the Palace.
 We were worried about you.
 You are still dressed, Patricia ?
 I was going to bed, when
 I heard the gunshots.
 I must confess that
 I was a little frightened.
 Would you like Rosanna
 to join you ?
 No, that isn't necessary.
 If I need anything, I will call
 Louisa. Good night.
 Good night.
 Good night.
 - Thank you.
 - You must go, now.
 - Why did you help me ?
 - Because ....
 Because they would
 have you killed.
 It was simple humanity
 that I acted that way.
 Is that the only reason ?
 Yes. Why do you press me ?
 For your love.
 My love ?
 Yes. You love me as I love you.
 No.
 Why do your lips deny
 what is revealed by your eyes ?
 No, let me go.
 Goodbye, Patricia.
 The one I freed is waiting for me.
 I must get him to safety.
 Wait !
 I am frightened for you.
 Fear not, all will be well.
 See if anyone is coming.
 - Sergeant, are you wounded ?
 - No !
 Once again he has fled.
 He escaped from me.
 You're a bunch of idiots !
 He was there, trapped,
 and you let him get away.
 You won't get away so easily !
 I will hang all those responsible.
 You, here ?
 I have to speak with you, Basil.
 Get out. Not now.
 No ! You will listen to me.
 I know everything.
 You thought getting rid of me
 would enable your new plans,
 but you were sadly mistaken.
 Never will you marry Patricia Scott.
 I will prevent it !
 Where did this idea come from ?
 That's enough, Basil !
 You have told me so many lies.
 I heard your discussion with
 Moore, so be on your guard,
 I am ready to do anything.
 Even notifying the Queen
 about your misdeeds.
 You will regret this, Basil !
 Be sure that you will.
 I will have my revenge.
 Gentlemen,
 you know the case that now
 must be discussed
 fills us with bitterness.
 One of our advisors, Lord Moore,
 abusing the function of guardian
 that we entrusted to him,
 has squandered the legacy
 left to his niece and nephew
 Patricia and William Scott.
 His administrator, Charles Burn,
 has confessed everything.
 His crimes, already terrible,
 are further compounded
 by the prestigious position
 he occupies as a noble Lord,
 a role that should serve as an
 example to all our citizens.
 In addition, the infrequent
 news coming from the Island
 is not reassuring.
 The power of Zorro seems
 to grow by the day,
 and the repression is becoming
 ever more ruthless.
 Obviously, Lord Moore has not
 only betrayed his niece and nephew.
 He has betrayed the trust
 that we placed on him.
 And so, it is from the members
 of this Privy Council, that
 we have decided that you,
 General Kingston,
 will travel to Hamilton
 and restore order.
 As you command, Your Majesty.
 I will sail for Hamilton
 without delay.
 Let us hope that you arrive
 before it is too late.
 Very nice indeed.
 My dear Governor,
 may I congratulate you.
 The idea of putting a price
 on the head of Zorro
 is excellent.
 Oh, this Zorro !
 Just a fool who thinks he can
 change things with his ranting.
 - I hope you will play again.
 - Of course.
 She played admirably.
 It was a joy to listen to.
 My compliments.
 Do I take it that you would
 like things to change ?
 Oh, no.
 For me,
 things are good as they are.
 I am content. I pay my taxes,
 even if I find them a little high.
 I am on very good terms
 with the Governor.
 Why would I want things
 to change ?
 There will always be malcontents
 and the dissatisfied.
 Captain Wells,
 we were speaking of your Zorro.
 My Zorro ?
 Shortly you will see him
 hanging from the end of a rope.
 Betrayed by those who are
 his friends and supporters.
 I think that you are wrong,
 Captain Wells.
 Zorro is revered.
 I am sure that, in Hamilton,
 there is no-one
 who would betray him for money.
 You are deluding yourself.
 Patricia !
 Don't pay any attention
 to what my niece said.
 At her age, the young often
 look upon rough bandits
 as heroes,
 if only because they pretend
 to act in the name of
 an imaginary justice.
 In fact, you are describing
 the judgment of a child ....
 I find you pensive and let down.
 I understand.
 You were hoping to find here
 a land of peace and joy.
 Instead, you've found only hatred,
 strife and the abuse of power.
 Even you admit it.
 Lady Patricia, I admit that
 I prefer the quiet life.
 But I have eyes that see,
 a mind that makes judgments
 and a heart ...
 I know.
 Yet, I haven't heard you take
 the side of those struggling
 and who want to change things.
 What would you have me do ?
 Put on a sword, don a black mask
 and start a fight ?
 Conspire against the Governor,
 like Manuel Garcia and Cortez,
 and finish up a prisoner
 or, at best, exiled ?
 No, that's not for me.
 So you will spend your
 whole life as you now are,
 complacent,
 with no fight in you ?
 I fight for things that mean
 something to me.
 Like love, for example.
 The love I felt for you
 on the day I first saw you
 and which gives me
 the courage to ask you :
 Will you marry me, Patricia ?
 You are very kind, Pedro,
 and I thank you for
 your proposal,
 but, for the moment, I have
 to say that
 what you ask me is impossible.
 Then, there is no more doubt.
 From your reaction, you have
 just confirmed to me
 that you are in love with Zorro.
 And if that were so ?
 Take care. It is dangerous to
 fall in love with a shadow.
 And Zorro, for you,
 is only a shadow.
 The quicker this marriage takes
 place, the better for us all.
 I think you are right, Moore.
 Silence !
 I've been quiet for a period
 to trick the Governor into
 thinking his troubles are over.
 But now is the time
 when we must all be prepared.
 We are happy that the time
 to act has arrived.
 And before risking our lives,
 I propose that,
 during the uprising,
 we proclaim our
 independence from England.
 I do not agree. We must not
 act against the Queen
 for whom
 we must remain faithful.
 The envoy from the Queen,
 on whom we placed our hopes,
 has shown himself incapable.
 He even increased the powers
 of the Governor.
 That corrupt diplomat,
 who, from personal interest,
 supports the Governor,
 should not make us forget
 that our colony has known
 happy times
 and prosperous ones,
 through our link with England.
 We will, therefore, only rebel
 against the corrupt power
 of the man who represents
 the Queen.
 These are the conditions
 under which
 I am willing to lead you.
 You are right, Zorro.
 We will follow you.
 And do what you want.
 - You all agree ?
 - Yes !
 For now,
 all of you return to your homes.
 Wait patiently for my orders.
 ''You are in great danger.
 ''Leave the Palace immediately.
 A carriage awaits you.
 ''Zorro.''
 - Who is it ?
 - It is I, Milady. Mendez.
 Well ?
 I wanted to tell you that
 the Governor
 hasn't retired to his bed.
 He's had 2 horses saddled: one
 for himself, one for Capt. Wells.
 - You wait 'til now to tell me ?
 - I couldn't do so before.
 Check the stable and try to
 find out where they are going.
 You !
 I was not mistaken.
 The charm of a bandit was
 enough to make you forget
 that you are of noble birth.
 - Where are we going ?
 - You will know soon enough.
 The other night, at the Palace,
 when I knocked on your door,
 a suspicion struck me.
 I decided to check and, shortly
 after, from my window,
 I saw Zorro leave you, after
 holding you tenderly.
 Why didn't you
 have him arrested ?
 It would have embarrassed you,
 and compromised our plan.
 What plan ?
 Your marriage
 to Sir Basil Ruthford.
 My marriage ?
 Basil is madly enamoured of you.
 He has asked me for your hand.
 And you have consented ?
 We are even now heading for
 the Convent of San Diego.
 You will be married there
 tomorrow.
 This remote spot has been
 chosen to avoid any folly
 on your part, or that of Zorro.
 You would do well to sit back,
 and listen to me.
 This is pointless.
 I refuse to marry him.
 If I am dragged to the altar,
 I will say no to the priest.
 I doubt that.
 I have some things to tell you ....
 Yes !
 Just a minute, I'm coming,
 Here I am !
 Where is your master ?
 - I'm sorry. He is sleeping.
 - Wake him, I must speak with him !
 I have orders not to disturb
 him under any circumstances.
 This is a matter of life-or-death.
 - I understand, but ....
 - What is it, Pedrito ?
 Milady Rosanna, pardon me.
 This is no time for niceties.
 This is an urgent matter.
 You may leave us.
 What is it ?
 Don Pedro, the lady you love
 is in danger.
 You must intervene.
 The lady I love ?
 Do not pretend.
 Patricia, everyone knows it.
 What has happened to Patricia ?
 She is being taken to
 the Convent of San Diego,
 where, in the morning, she
 will be married to the Governor.
 I must send her a wedding gift,
 with my best wishes.
 But ... I thought ...
 You must not concern yourself.
 Yes, I have a great affection
 for Lady Patricia.
 I may even love her a little,
 but not to the point of
 confronting the Governor.
 This young woman is
 the victim of a conspiracy
 between her guardian
 and Basil Ruthford !
 How do you know that ?
 I heard them plotting.
 If you were to intervene ....
 The Governor dislikes me,
 as does the Queen's Envoy.
 No, thank you, I won't get involved
 It's too dangerous a game.
 In this world, there are plenty
 of other women.
 Certainly, it's not women we lack.
 But, as for men in Hamilton,
 there is only one worthy
 of the name : Zorro !
 I have an idea.
 Try and find Zorro.
 Get to Cortez.
 Tell him it's the time to act.
 It is of little matter to me
 if I am poor.
 I can forgive your crimes,
 but I beseech you :
 do not force me
 to marry a man I despise.
 And what of your brother ?
 What will happen to him ?
 He will have to leave College.
 And renounce a future
 worthy of his name.
 and of his rank.
 Have you thought of that ?
 Sir Basil wants you so much
 that he has waived your dowry.
 He will pay for William's education.
 In exchange, you will send
 a favourable report to the Queen.
 We are being bartered
 to resolve your problems.
 Well ?
 Get ready.
 They are coming. Get ready.
 Silence !
 Hold your tongues !
 I said - Silence !
 You - quiet !
 Quickly, free us !
 Liberty, liberty !
 Come on, all of you !
 Quickly, to horse !
 Follow me !
 Louisa ! Hurry yourself !
 - Where are you taking me ?
 - Climb up, have no fear.
 Don't ask so many questions.
 What is this ?
 Is anyone else about ?
 No... Excellency.
 Who are you ?
 What are you doing here ?
 I - I am ...
 I will tell you ...
 Basil Ruthford,
 do you wish to take as
 your wife, this woman
 Patricia Scott ?
 I do.
 Patricia Scott,
 do you wish to take as your
 husband, this man, Basil Ruthford ?
 No !
 Sir Basil Ruthford,
 you will be dealt with differently.
 You must pay for all your crimes.
 But not here.
 You are not worthy
 of the House of the Lord.
 I could kill you now.
 But the English Court
 must judge you.
 No ! I demand justice.
 Patricia, come here.
 Patricia !
 Take him !
 Let me go !
 Let me go !
 I see you have already solved
 my problems.
 General Kingston,  Envoy of
 Her Majesty, Queen of England.
 I have come here to restore
 order and justice.
 Lord Moore,
 you have betrayed your duty
 and caused the revolt
 of these people.
 In the name of Her Majesty,
 I arrest you.
 You, take him !
 And you, put down your arms.
 Excellency, I confess to acting
 for the good of my country
 and the triumph of justice.
 I am ready to be judged by
 the Court of England.
 Here is my sword.
 Keep it.
 I know that you acted in
 the best interests of England.
 And I am ready publicly
 to acknowledge it.
 But, to do that, you must
 first remove your mask
 and show your true face.
 Pedro !
 Silence !
 Don Pedro Suarez,
 by virtue of the powers
 vested in me
 and in the name of Her Majesty,
 Victoria Alexandra of Kent,
 Queen of England,
 I hereby appoint you
 Governor of the Island of Hamilton.
