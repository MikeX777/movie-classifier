 My love sweet and sensual
How are you

in your cell. 
 You know it hurts me read it ...
 ... I fear it will bring you problems.

 After all these years,

The atmosphere had changed

 Many of them had died
or disappeared. 
 At first I was a little scary

I, father, Enzo.
How are you, Father Serafino?
It helped me when I came out of jail
Pianosa, some years ago.
Pippo's son: "Lighters, apparatus,
aerosols, hand grenades ...".
Do you remember the little Enzo?
The son of that Pippo that
sold cigarettes ...
I went to greet you, Father.
I'm in trouble.
I'm too young to retire,
too old to work. Where am I?
What should I do?
Is going to steal? Kidnapping ¿?
To shoot back to the police? Are you shooting
again to end my days in jail?
 A countdown.
He counted the days, hours. 
 For him, every day was a
less suffering. 
 For me, it was difficult.
He had the responsibility ...
 ... to find shelter
for when out ...
 ... and think a little
our future. 
 He called me every time
gave permission and I ran.

night together. 
 were wonderful days. 
 Every week, we sent
a package of clean laundry, ...
 ... something to eat and cassettes ...
 ... where my voice was recorded.
I tried to calm him. 
We had a dream . 
 Having a house in the country
a Huertita ...
 ... and perhaps a porch
a beautiful bank ...
 ... where we squeezed
to look to the horizon ...
 ... surrounded with our dogs, and ...
 ... which wait for the old age ...
 ... where we were a little peace,
with confidence. 
 That's all we wanted. 
 home to Christopher Columbus 
- What health for whom? Do you pay?
- Yes, do not worry.
- To your health, nothing. You have not paid.
- Here's to your health.
- Pants pay!
- He says he pays.
- To me! A bottle of champagne.
- I should!
- Want to bet?
- No. You're gonna lose.
It was a round,
Do you want to offer!
He touched my ass!
No, I pondered the situation
economy.
Do not bother! I am very hot.
Break my balls!
I pierced my eyes!
Do not start again.
I want to ask a question.
Where fulfilled your worth?
No, seriously.
Where was what? Does the jail?
What the fuck do you care where
I turned my grief?
- Were you in jail?
- Ever ...
And now, chupámela!
What the fuck are you looking at me?
I asked, is all.
Go ask the police!
They will tell you where I turned off!
They have a good record.
Claudio, do you serve a beer?
A Turbo.
- A Bourbon?
- A Turbo!
Understood bourbon,
as whiskey.
A Tuborg!

- I am deaf.
Man, I wash your head?
- Do not touch!
- Stop it. What are you doing?
A wash!
I will make one.
A kick in the ass!
Then, play the juke-box.
You put a disc and I sing.
The juke-box!
Tell me what you want to hear ...
... and I get to the stage.
And I sing.
- Do you sing?
- I sing!
 - I sing!
- It is not the same as you. 
 For those who did not listen,
I want to sing 
Oh, Richard!
- Pausini? No, Cocciante.
- Exactly.
It Cocciante, I'm sure.
- For, Enzo!
- Bravo!
I put the horns

- First me, then she.
- Do we stop?
Do not forgive this. I

- You're a friend!
- You betrayed me!
Coward!
You is friendship,
with her is love.
- You betrayed me! Before you kissed me!
- Who do you tell?
- Yes, for the film, to the scene.
- Be careful, huh?
She's a friend.
To you, I love you.
Right now, he kissed me.
You is love. With it is friendship,

She is the wife of Mimmo,

- I was the wife of Mimmo.
- Yes, he died.
 Enzo has spent much
of his life in prison.

nine years ago. 
 day of his release
was wonderful. 
 But then when I thought
it was all over, ...
 ... came one night
and arrested him.

 was a shock to him. 
He even started drinking  ...
 ... and derailed. 
Someone should make me dance!
I  Machaco has ruined his life
by nonsense. 
 He has spent a lot of years
in jail for anything ...
 ... instead of, I do not know ...
 ... taking acting lessons. 
 He could have become an actor
with their physical ...
 ... and break into the movies. 
 The police are always right,
law always prevails.

This changes everything.

But I'm not at all.

 each cross. 
 mine, have been
so far. 
It is your word.
It is not true what he said.
I was in prison in
that moment ...
... because before I got high.
I too, like him, was in
the limit of the ...
... of despair.
He sent me almost five grams
of heroin a day.
It was really a scrap.
Until a supervisor told me:
''Mary, there is a Sicilian boy
upstairs ...
... that can give you cigarettes ...
... if you shorten the pants. "
As I had nothing
at all, ...
... I have a package suited
of cigarettes.
And I agreed.
Then I brought the pants
and I fixed it.
And when I finished ...
... I went to the floor where he was.
The cell and the door was closed,
then scrimmage.
The peephole opens soon ...
... and I see it in all its glory.
Wearing shorts ...
... and it was all ...
Long sport.
He had a magnificent physique
at that time.
I was struck by her composure, ...
... for its impressive beauty.
But at the same time,
was intimidated ...
... by air so rude.
I expected nothing at all.
I was almost intimidated,
could hardly speak.
And he ... ''Thanks.''
And he gave me cigarettes.
He said:''If you
sending poems, ...
... I can do you translate?''
In short, it was an excuse
to approach me.
Seeing that I was alone, ...
... I was happy
to make friends.
So I get these letters, ...
... to translate these poems,
and I took them in my cell.
Thus began.
But I was a little reserved, ...
... I kept my distance.
Until one morning when I went
library section ...
... I had to go through a broker
to get to the library.
I walk into the library, ...
... and when I leave the door
bookstore, I find it before me.
He grabs my hand ...
... give me a kiss on the lips, ...
... so ... I was shocked.
And that was the beginning
of our history.
As soon as we could, we were
during the hour ride.
It was the only one speaking.
He, too, had not a penny ...
... but he was gifted with his hands.
Did you know ...
With the matches, was
lighters, ...
... small frames. Very beautiful things.
Those items manufactured
exchanged ...
Over the supervisors,
was supplied ...
... cans of tomatoes,
peas, pasta.
With it, we've never gone hungry
in my cell.
I was with two other
transsexuals.
We were separated from the others.
I saw it during the daily walk.
I spent my time to ride
in your company.
As we were in two
different cells, ...
... took place in my apartment,
front of my cell.
In this way, we could talk.
To achieve this, as
I could not scream ...
... taught me a dumb alphabet.
I learned little by little, ...
... We communicated through
this alphabet.
I do not know.
It is he who ... communicated
that way.
Honestly, ...
... I spent four months ...
It may sound absurd ...
... but those four months
were wonderful.
I'm not saying they have been
the best of my life ...
... but those four months
were exceptional.
This is absurd since
was in jail.
But honestly, for
those four months, ...
... I got everything you could want ...
... tenderness and understanding.
All the love I sought,
I met him.
He showed me and I spent
four wonderful months.
This is how our story
began.
And it takes twenty years.
Twenty years have passed since
we're together.
These are the four best
months of your life.
I owe you the best fourteen
years of my life!
He was sentenced to
almost ten years.
But I waited.
Meanwhile, I went from
one prison to another ...
... to see him almost every month.
But it's ...
First, it's like
I stopped using drugs ...
... because when I met him ...
... No one had visited ...
... neither my family nor my friends
ones.
He had tried to give me advice:
''For, you should stop
take drugs. "
"Step into the wonderful person
you were. "
I said "Yes, yes," but not
had the strength.
- Meanwhile he ...
- Thanks to my strength.
... with her tenderness, her character, ...
... its hardness, but also
with its sweetness, ...
... gave me the strength to have
a purpose.
Even to wait ten years.
I said, I see ...
... I have to go far,
how far we can go.
It has almost become a target
in my life.
- And twenty years later, we're here.
- We did it!
Not without difficulty, because ...
... life is not only difficult in prison
even in prison is easy because ...
... the only problem that exists,
is eating and sleeping.
And make the time pass.
What is ugly in life ...
... are all problems
to be faced to live.
- There is something else, my love.
- What?
¿I can say something?
The guards who brought the food ...
... did not like homosexuals.
The mistreated.
One day, I called one. Peace to his soul,
because they died.
I said,''you bring to eat
to this cell.
"If you touch Mary, I play to me, and
're dead. "
- Who do you bother then? No one.
- It's true.
You belong to Enzo and nobody bothered
for a long time.
Thirty people lay alone for
When walking, does not it?
Yes, indeed.
And I broke a leather ball
in the face. He blew his head.
Is not it true?
This boy was the goalkeeper.
I said, "Forward."
I threw a pitch and
I broke the ball.
- It's true.
- She confirms it.
And woe to those that touch!
Neither the guards was allowed.
One night, a guard put chile
under the nose.
I said, "Guard, come here a
moment ... Do you see?
If you allow it once again, I cut
the head. I stab with or without uniform. "
I had shit to lose.
Or not?
It's true.
We were so close to both ...
... which was isolated from all ...
- Of all the rest of the band!
- In the entire section.
They were afraid of me. We were
time of thirty to ride ...
... and nobody said a word wrong.
Otherwise, they are

All detainees!
She and I both are
dominant.
She dominates me and I domain.
But she's the one going.
Only when I raise my voice,
all is well. Is repeated.
Not because I want to dominate.
Because we understand!
We are old now.
What is the song of the old?
"Both of us must do one."
No, the beginning.
No, better not
sing it now.
Dila, I sing.
In any case, not dominate.
We know, that's all.
Both , we must make one. 
We consoled ourselves  old and happy. 
 I thank God for this life ...
 ... close to you without speaking. 
Our journey ends here  ...
 ... between the lights of the night
and Quarto dei Mille. 
Let the castaways  protected

 There are only traces of the

Small  great stories,
That's what it was.

 That's what it was ...
