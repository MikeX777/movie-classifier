Charlotte? Come and see Jen's baby.
Hello. Hi.
How are you?
I'm good.
We're having a little nap.
So, how are you finding it?
Great. She is a little joy,
honestly.
Do you want a hold?
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Yeah, go on. Come on.
There we go.
There.
There, that's it.
Yeah.
Aawww. She likes you.
Really? She's not normally this good
with strangers, honestly.
Oh, she can be
a right madam sometimes.
I bet you're looking forward
to getting back to work.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm back in June.
Erm...
But you know what, I think
I might just stay at home,
do the whole mum thing instead,
you know?
What about your career?
Of course. Yeah, I know,
but, erm...
Well, now Tom's been made partner,
I can kind of relax a bit.
Tom's been made a partner?
Has it... Has it not
been announced yet?
Oh, sorry.
Hmm.
Oh, bigmouth strikes again, eh?
OK.
Oh.
Oh, sweetie.
Come back to Mummy.
Oh!
I'm so, so sorry, Charlotte.
Please, send me
the dry-cleaning bill.
It's fine.
Charlotte, do you have a minute?
Sure.
Bye, Charlotte, nice to see you.
You too.
Yes. Yeah, that's better.
Has she got any teeth yet?
Yeah, she's got two.
Come on, baby. Yes.
Show us your little teeth.
Oh, lovely little smile. Yeah.
She's a happy
little girl, isn't she?
This is shit!
Of course I can market
over Mina, I just did.
Well, then stop trying
to feed me such utter bullshit.
Well, what's the procedure?
We went through a procedure.
It's constructive dismissal,
that's what it is, Simon.
I was promised equity in the merger
and now you're trying
to get rid of me.
I've been here three years
longer than Tom.
Look, he wouldn't even be in
a position to sell the agency
if it wasn't for my input.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my world.
Plea...
Right.
Fuck.
VACUUM STOPS
I don't expect you.
I can see that.
What have I told you
about smoking in my home?
I'm sorry.
I said smoking was unacceptable.
Do you remember me saying that?
Yes.
OK.
Well, as I've warned you before,
I don't want you
to clean for me any more.
OK, I not charge you this week.
It's not about the money,
Maya, it's about trust.
I really need this job.
You should've thought about that
before you polluted my apartment.
I want you to leave, now, please.
SHE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
Maya.
Maya, hold on.
Look...
You do a good job.
Just...
please use the terrace
if you want to smoke.
What's that?
Is mine.
Well, it's not, is it?
It's mine...
and you're going to
give it back to me. No!
I knew it was a mistake
not going through an agency!

You've had an accident.
It was not accident.
You give me pills
and then I need to go.
You, uh... You can keep
the champagne.
Is very kind.
SHE LAUGHS
Are you all right?
You...
are so unhappy.
I have to go now.
I think you should sit
and rest a while longer.
I not stay here so you feel better.

I've been at a client lunch

getting over here.
I'm on your side.
I swear, I thought they were going
to make you partner as well.
It was only when...
..David asked me to take over your
accounts that...
Look, you know, I did as much as I
could do, but...
But I want you to know...
..that I am with you with this, all
the way.
I'll do anything. I don't care
what it is, I'll do it.
Really? Mm-hmm.
First thing tomorrow morning, I'm
going to hook you up with Sally,
my head-hunter. She's brilliant.
There's nothing you can do, Tom.
Yes, I can. I really can.
Look, Sally will get you
a brilliant job, she's...
I couldn't care less.
It's about the baby.
What?
I know how horrible it must have
been for you, and...
You know, especially on top of everything
else that happened yesterday, but...
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but I swear to you on little Grace's
life that I had no idea Jen was
going to bring her into the office
yesterday.
She did it on the spur of the moment.
I need you to leave, now, Tom.
No.
No...
We need to work through this.
The last thing I want is for all of
this to get in the way of us.
And...
I've got a free pass for
the whole night.
Come on.
What are you doing?
If you don't leave now, I'm going to
call your wife.
Right. I tried.
What a waste of time.

So sorry about that.
Oh, aren't you a beautiful
little girl?
Just like your mummy, eh?
Thank you. What's her name?
Um... Rosy.
Oh, that's a lovely name.
Agnes. I'm just saying hello to
the new neighbours.
We're moving in next week.
So, hope to see you again soon.
Bye-bye, Rosy.
Rosy.
Rosy.
Yeah.
Given the circumstances,
I want nine months gross
and I'm keeping the car.
OK.
Six months plus bonus.
And I want this resolved as soon
as possible, Simon.
Thank you. Bye.

Can you not help me? She's really sick.
'I'm afraid I must have that number first.'

God. Shh, shh, shh, sshhh.

Hi. All right?
You remember your Auntie Charlotte,
don't you?
Oh, two kisses now, eh?
You look fucking terrible, you do.
A nice pad, though, eh, Char?
Oh, my God, look at that view!
Come on, love, let's have a look.
Are we all right going out, Char?
Yeah. Come on, kid, let's have
a look.
Oh, my God!
It's gorgeous, isn't it?
Whooooo!
We're in London for the weekend.
Ah.
Let's have a look.
Well, she's all right.
I don't understand.
She was burning up before.
Yeah, well, babies get temperatures
all the time, it's no big deal.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what else
to do.
Well, even know-it-alls like you
can't know everything, eh, Char?
She's beautiful, isn't she?
She is, yeah.
Ah.
Little pudding.
There you go.
Ta.
So, she... She had cancer?
Yeah, breast cancer.
How old was she?
32.
What, and she had no other family?
No, not that I know of.
So, you've decided to take
the kid on?
Well, it was the least I could do.
I wish you'd contacted me sooner.
It just happened so quick,
we didn't even have time to tell
the authorities and whatnot.
I was worried she'd get taken
into care.
Right.
You want to stay clear of the
Social.
Be careful, yeah?
Thanks for the clothes.
That's all right, they were just, you know,
sitting in a cupboard, doing nothing.
It's a great help.
And it means a lot.
Um...I stink, can I borrow
your shower?
Yeah, but don't go using
all the hot water, young lady.
Yeah. You girls think money
grows on the bloody trees.
What are you up to?
I'm playing with my sister.
She's not your sister,
she's your cousin.
I want her to be my sister.
Why's that?
So I can play with her every day.
I think Rosy would like that.
Shit.
Hi.
Hiya. I saw you drop your box.
What? You know, on telly.
The old CCTV.
Can't tell you how much I love
this flat, Char.
It's amazing.
Are you all right?
Um... Yeah, yeah.
I've, um...
I've, I've left something at work,
I've come all this way home.
Can you just mind Rosy for a bit
longer while I go and sort it?
Oh, you are joking, aren't you?
We've come all this way to see you.
I'll be really quick.
Oh, it's fine.
It's not like I'm not used
to you running off, eh?
Look, OK, tonight, when we get back,
I promise we'll sit down and we'll
have a good drink and a natter.
Right.
Stop by the chippy on the way back,

It's only fishcakes.
Oh, don't bother me,

One fish is bigger than the other,
so I'll give you more chips, right?
Is this the only vinegar
you've got, Char?
Yes, sorry.
And you forgot the gravy. No,
actually, down here in civilisation,
we don't do gravy on chips.
Oh, right.
Well, in that case, I better get us
a drink to wash it down with, eh?
Nice try with Westhill Tower.
Unfortunately, I spent a year

No, it's... I just don't want any.
Oh, come on, sis.
No, really, I'm fine. Right, Rog,
pour Char a glass, will you?

you've had a payoff.
Wow.
That really is something to
celebrate.
INAUDIBLE
I was out with this mate of mine,
terrible he is,
can't handle his drink at all.
We've had, what, seven, eight pints,
and he has thrown up all
over himself.
Jesus! Seriously, right there in
the middle of the pub,
he is all over the place.
He's going, "Oh, my wife's going to
kick me out," you know,
"She said if I come home like this
one more time we're finished."
I said to him, "Chill out, pal.
"When you go home, have a £20 note
in your hand and say some geezer
"threw up on you and gave it to you
for the dry-cleaning."
So, he goes home, wife takes one
look at him, tries to chuck him out,
he goes, "No, no, no, no, no.
"When I was on the train home,
some geezer threw up on me,
"gave me a score for the
dry-cleaning."
She goes, "But you've got 40 quid
in your hand."
He goes, "Yeah. The other 20 quid is
from the geezer that shat in my pants."
You... You're full of shit.
No, straight up.
So, um...
So, what's the deal with
these vandals then, Char?
What? You know, the vandals.
What's been going on?
Oh, something went on in
the car park a few days back,
but I found it all on CCTV.
Oh, here you are,
let's have a look, then.

OK. OK, I accept
there are issues...
You're too fucking right there's
issues...
But, please!
Please...
Listen to me.
We have got to get him out of here.
And then we're going to pack our stuff,
