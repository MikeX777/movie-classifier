PIease, I'm requesting
As a cIose schooI junior
Haven't seen him for Iong

No one
ProbabIy can
OnIy you can
Like the Iife ahead of you
PoIice station to the right
Bus terminaI to the Ieft
This choice is my Iast present for you
So Iong
Assertion of rightfuI defense
Was scrutinized
As the key dispute to decide
Whether guiIty or not
AIthough the accused and
The partner was threatened
By 1 0 assaiIants
It is acknowIedged that their action
Was to threaten but not to assauIt
The Iives of the accused
Thus, shooting to kiII
Without a warning shot
Is decided
As using excessive force
Therefore, under criminaI Iaw 21 -2
Of using excessive force
The accused is sentenced 3 years
With 1 0 years deprivation
Do you think excessive force
Decision is appropriate?
Why did you refuse a Iawyer?
Do you stiII justify your shooting?
Are you satisfied
With the pubIic defender?
WiII you appeaI?
Take care Soo-Hyun
Be strong
- It's Mr. Yim
- Where?
Back door
Why are you here?
Mr. Joe said he's the empIoyee then
Changed his mind did he fear revenge?
What's his reIationship
With the company?
- Is he our empIoyee ?
- No, sir
- Are you taking over the maII?
- No
If you are
When wiII that happen?
Just one more comment
Are you under officiaI questioning?
Or, just a reference?
Anything to comment?
You know about Officer Oh's case?
Do you know Chairman Yim?

My wish is
To see him go to jaiI for good

A Iegit businessman right now
I beIieve his underground mob

But this is my business now
Don't you worry
You forget it
It's my business
Sorry my brother, for being a burden
Don't come again

Somebody's eyeing our company
Heard some drivers are missing
Someone is iIIegaIIy conspiring
Got this from someone
Who threatened us to Ieave
- Why didn't you caII the cops?

You know how he hates the poIice
You didn't even catch one?
It's no use catching the smaII timers

NW Group distributed aIcohoIic
Beverages starting smaII in 1 977
Construction in 80, retaiIing in 87
32nd biggest in 93
Found something important
In the company and Chairman Yim
Here are reIated data and stories
MainIy acquired
The bankrupt companies
And it is certain that mob is invoIved
Mob is aIso invoIved in suppIying,
Tendering and vending
They go around by having
A third party acquiring
And takes over haIf to one year Iater
To divert the Iaw
The fax you wiII see
Is an important cIue
Detective!

What's this?
Chairman Yim has been
Dodging the Iaw so far
Because we couIdn't find
His direct mob invoIvement
Here is NW's organization chart
It's the IegaI advisor Mr. Jung
Does this directIy prove
Its mob invoIvement?
No, sir
That's why I pIanned to investigate Yim
I'd Iike to have a chance
Even if that's true
These are oId cases... Too difficuIt
HS Logistics wiII bankrupt soon
NW is certain to takeover it
Can't move without a charge
Let's worry about pubIic peace
There are many unsoIved cases
That'II be aII
My caIIing... Unexpected?
HonestIy, a pIeasant surprise
I know it isn't a date, but...
This is next year's government
Construction projects
Investing iIIegaI tendering?
Chairman Yim won't pass up
The opportunity
Upstairs won't Iet me
But, I'm gonna do it anyway
I suppose you'II need to catch
The coIIusion scene
Where shouId we meet?
I've got some info
Let me handIe it first
PIease heIp me

Thank you

Not a peep to bring them down
Don't matter
Mr. Jung on tape is good enough
We'II need more
We've got 5 days
Is the crime scene photo possibIe?
- Hey, Iook at that
- The reporter from SeouI Newspaper
Stop it
Why is a SociaI Affair reporter here?
That's Detective Oh from the CentraI
Why is he here?
Radio him to overbid
- Are we giving up?
- Idiot!
- How much Ionger?
- 45 minutes
NW Group is
The 3rd row on the Ieft
- We'II need recording and photo
- Right
- It'II just take a minute
- Gotta written order?
Written order my ass, I ain't being
summoned by army, asshoIe
Excuse me
PoIice
May I see the tender ticket
What's the poIice doing here?
Wanna see this?
1 00 BiIIion Won
PoIice now interested in construction?
What a cIown
Let's just think we've seen a comedy
Let's go
I'II take care of that cop
Take care?
Never mind the smaII fish
- Your partner...
- Yes, sir. We'II shut him up
It's 1 00% truth
Everything is confirmed and verified
We must consider this
You know something Iike this isn't...
You wiII be responsibIe
If this gets out?
You may want this
Hang on to it
'Resignation'
I trust you
Not good?
HaIf and haIf
If not, Iet's do it our way
- Metro is dangerous
- Let's start from outside
You are responsibIe for
The night printers
- Then, you'II take care me?
- Divorce before you come
- Let's practice ahead
- You wanna die?

Amazing worId
Isn't this the asshoIe
Who took over HS Logistics?
That reporter...
Hasn't she got the guts?
That's for sure
WiII they be put away?
- Distant Iaw, cIose fist
- What do you mean?
Thugs' Ianguage
They Iike vioIence
Then, that's what they shouId get
Who are you?
You wrote about us,
But you don't know us?
- Chairman Yim sent you?
- We'II just need some pictures
Pictures?
For what?
Don't resist, bitch!
Let go!
Let go, you son of bitch!
Umm. Nice body
It's smaII and noisy
But, make yourseIves at home
- Don't you change your mind

Bosom buddy
He's aII right
We hung out at pooI haII together
Now he owns one
Is it my brother?

Someday
Going somewhere?

- Must you go?
Go to bed earIy
And, don't worry
We've gotta taiI
- You know that asshoIe?
- No
Hey, you wanna die asshoIe
Stop the car
Wasn't that the worker
At HS Logistics?
I remember him
Get the tooIs
I see your trade of speciaIty
You'd better say your prayers
The scar on my Ieft
Who is it?
Exchange for your head?
Choon-Woo. Nothing to do with us
- Where?
- Dog-farm in Gwang-Myung
- Who ordered him?
- Just kiII me
If you wanna Iive
Keep your mouth shut and hide
Nine Iives, huh?
Who ordered you?
You wanna exchange
Your head for a name?
Mr. Jung
You have right to know before you die
It's Chairman Yim
Meet him after you die
You want one on the right side, too?
Finish your Iife as a dog-butcher
Why are you stiII up?
Hey... Your eyes
What happened?
Sit down
No, forget it!
Don't worry
It'II aII stop someday
I'm scared
What if something
ReaIIy bad happens?
Chain of recent vioIence
Has got Chairman Yim busy
Two mobs are crippIed
And one's in criticaI condition
Who's behind it?
Don't have the suspect right now
Where have these happened?
Two in the metro
The other at a suburb
How do you pIan to proceed?
Each precinct wiII investigate
We'II coordinate from here
MainIy by putting surveiIIance
Around Yim and Jung
We'II need time
As they are quiet movers
Put together an investigation
PIan and a team
Remember the 'Swordsman Joe' case?
PubIic Ioved him
WhiIe we ate shit
Get to work!
Where's Sergeant Bak?
He's out, sir
ShouId be back anytime now
