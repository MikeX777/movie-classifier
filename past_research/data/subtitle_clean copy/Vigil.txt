No need, it's over now.
- Thanks for all that you've done.
- No trouble.
I was shooting your goats, and...
The coroner said it was an accidental death,
now let's leave it at that.
Right.
I just wanted to get it sorted out.
Do you feel better now?
Yeah. Thanks.
Well, now you can piss off.

That tractor's been sitting
out there watching, waiting.
Before you know it,
she's up and off and after us.

How do you see it otherwise?
Look...
It sends out little miniatures of itself.

Get that tractor fixed,
and the world's my oyster.
I'll have time to do the things I need to do.
Good man, that Ethan Ruir.
Good pair of shoulders on him.
At the funeral, the priest talked about
a valley of death and ashes.
Oh, it's just the sort of thing they say.
See, I've got this idea for a sheep dip
where you make the sheep do all the work.
Where is the valley?
Maybe I could combine it with the turbine.
A small one to start with, and then... Ho ho!
Where is it?
Oh, it's just priest's talk.
Don't bother with it.
They make simple things complicated
so as to keep themselves in work.
I can use this jacket.
- Got us a new shepherd.
- What do you mean?
- New shepherd. The bloke who...
- Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
There's too much for this old back
to carry. And yours.
Besides, we owe him a favor.
A favor?
We're not staying here. I'm getting out.
Huh!
We're going to get out, are we?
Well, we'll bloody soon see about that!

Great set-up you've got here.
GRANDDAD: Come on in.
ETHAN: That hut on the hill suits me fine.
Now what have you got lined up for me?
TOSS: What's the matter?
Nothing.
Silly bugger, Justin.
Only time I ever saw him worked up
was over them hawks.
Oh, he got a bit toey
when he thought I was shirking,
but not worked up though.
Not like the hawks got him going.
His passion was hawks.
Or killing them.
Silly bugger.
Takes more than him or you to wipe out hawks.
He wasn't a smiling man, Justin.
But when he was wiring them
to the fences, he smiled.
And I got to thinking
about Justin and the hawks,
how he saw them,
what they looked like in his head.
You follow?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Now, when you think of hawks,
what do you see?
I see them diving out of the sun,
so that their prey can't see them.
And racing just above the ground
without moving their wings.
Ah, there you are.
What you see depends on who you are.
He just saw them as something bigger
and tougher than he was...
smarter too, though that wouldn't take much.
I watched him through the years.
And I tried to see the hawks
like he saw them.
Mom! Mom!
Mom, I'm scared.
I've got something to show you.
Surprised, are you?
Of course it isn't finished yet.
Don't seem right to work on it now he's gone.
Well, no sense in getting Liz more upset.
You had a bit of dust-up the other day, huh?
Best keep your head down
till she blows warm again.
- When's that gonna be?

I was going to burn that stuff
I cut down yesterday.
- Anything else to go on the pile?
- The burning can wait.
There are twelve hundred lambs
should have been docked three weeks ago.
You get your head up and what happens?
- Dad, you took on this farmhand, now...
- That jacket's a bit small for you.
We'll see if there's another lying about.
You think you're so clever.

I think the old boy's just about
had enough, though.
Got his leg, has he?
He's really been going at it.
When he works, you can't stop him.
When his leg seizes up,
he puts his mind to it and he won't budge.
He tells me it's a war wound.
I've heard so many stories about that leg.
I don't know which one's right.
Do you know he once told me
he fell out of a balloon?
(LAUGHS)
What's he doing up there now?
Figures he can drain the valley.
Oh, I'll give him three days
and he'll let it rust.
You're different.
What do you mean, different?
Well you've invited me into the house.
You can wash up here.

ETHAN:
He reckons it's all to do with drainage.
See, there's this big cavern underground.

it's like pulling a plug...

I can't run the place by myself.

- Why, can't you cope?
I wouldn't get too settled here if I was you.
- You giving me notice?
- Yeah.
You'll be finished at the end of the month.
Don't worry, missus. I'll be long gone.
- Are you afraid of work?
- Depends more on the boss than the work.
- Oh, you would have had a lot of those.
- A few.
None of them women, eh?
You'd be surprised.
Listen poacher, you're here
to do a job, and just that job.
Now I don't care if you have
to chase up the odd goat.
That's your business, and in your own time.

You move when she moves,
so she can't see you.
Stop when she stops.
You can see their heart beating.
When they're captured,
they're kept in the dark.
I saw them once.
An enormous building.
I opened the door.
The light sent them scattering
to the far corner.
I stood stock still waiting
for them to calm down.
They just stood there...
shivering and sniffing the air.
They could hear me breathing.
Can...
Can you call my father?
I'll brew up some tea.
I'll show you something.
There's a shadow in the glass.
A spirit.
How did you do that?
Magic.
The... The day Dad died,
were you hunting a deer?
Yeah.
I think I wounded it.
Where do you think it is?
- Depends.
- On what?
Well, if he's hurt, he'll head
for the tops where there are no flies.
If the flies got to her first then...
- Dead?
- Yep.
With God.
Don't know about that.
You go to God when you die.
That stag's rotting in the bush.
Sometimes you kill one,
but somewhere and somehow
it's dragged itself,
maybe only forty feet away
to where the dark camouflages it,
and you never see it again.
God doesn't care, does he?
Does the sky care?
Do the hills care?
God doesn't care, I don't care either.
If He doesn't care, I don't care about Him!
Here's one in the eye of God!
One in your ear!
One up your nose!

- I went to sleep.
Before you went to sleep.
Oh, we talked a bit, and he knows about deer,
- and they get scared in...
- Mmh, he knows about deer alright.
He's strange. He captures spirits
and puts them in glass.
