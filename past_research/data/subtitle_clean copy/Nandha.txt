The period in which the almighty
saved Celestial
That period is called meritorious time
in reference to Lord Shiva
'Dhosham' means 'Defect'
'Pradhosham' means 'Pious'
So, if you pray Lord Shiva
during the Pious time
Your sins will disappear!
Now, Is your husband behaving well?
I asked, now, Is your husband
behaving well?
Boss, Sir is calling you...
Next month, there's a most meritorious time

we brought?
We should have the heart which
doesn't desire wealth!!
Who has taught song to
the Air?
Who has shown the way

Does the journey of life ask
you & me for directions?

You've so many colleges

Do one thing...
I can't decide this...
I'll inform sir by

Do you've the chit?
He has only asked us to come...
Move... Move...
He's the new collector... - Greetings...
Here, Government building,
college, hospital
Everything is their
ancestor's property
Including our collector office
He is Bhaskar Raja
Now, we've to come to see his son
who's an elderly person...
Only in his period, king's
rule ended
And Government had taken
over everything...
Even though, they're not in power today
Sir, people have the same
respect and regard for them...
If I tell, you shouldn't
mistake me
According to this town -
People have more faith on him
than the Government & the law
He has his own law!
Government has issued a G.O., saying...
Remove the statue of Raja
from Collector's office
And replace it with the
late leader's statue
That's why we've come here
to inform you...
What's there to inform...
Because we've taken this place from you...
that's why...
Hey! you haven't taken, we
had given you...
Ask her to stop
Will the God come, if she
rings the bell?
I don't mind if you
remove it
If there's no friction among people
because of the new statue, Then it's okay
Because problem starts
from there...
If you're against it, can I ask?
What else?
You & your friends are frequently
going to the camp
It's good that you're helping
people...
Transit camp means it's connected
with the united nations -Wait...
Transit?
In which period, are you living?
It's a 'Repatriates' camp...
You should get permission
to go there...
That is... It's enough if you
give them a letter
That means to help our neighbour
Do I've to write a letter to the Govt.
begging for the permission?
Sir, it's just a formality...
Write & give it to them...
You're the Collector of
which town?
Principal asked me
to see you...
He studies well... they're not
admitting him...
Who are you?
If, I've studied in
the 'Minor Jail'
Will you not give me a seat?
Who told you?
For that only, it was built
Except for this, everything
else is going
You go & see... I'll tell them...
Son, Manohara...
Come here...

the childhood for murdering his father...
Father, who's that Bald head?
Are you a rough guy?
You're a daring person because you've
seen the jail in childhood itseIf
Nanda's name should be known
to everyone...
Everyone should be scared
after hearing your name
You've that desire, Isn't it?
You should be like this...
Nothing wrong in that...
One should have that fear...
But your friends doesn't have
I know that students
will be indiscriminate...
Will it change?
It should...
It'll change if you start
thinking deeply
Those who're roaming in the college
what they are going to do in future?
Did you eat?
Father... okay...

He had killed 1000's 0f Elephants
in the world
So, War is going to start...

You were upside down in
the mother's Womb...
Your path is not a right path...
Here, you've got a new relation
to lie on the shoulder
Pillars will break into pieces...
There's no music of flute...
there's no Cuckoo's song...
You know only the sound
of thunder!!
You're very stubborn...
and you've joined with the thorn
Today, you're blossoming
out of affection!!
If that king, didn't have compassion
there wouldn't have been Buddha period
Without sacrifice and renunciation
- No one can become a hermit!!
You're living on the lap
of the Fire
And seeking solace on
the Seashore
You're standing on the middle
of the road...
Sir, from Ceylon, family with kids have been
left in the middle of the sea
They're all starving & dying...
What are these stupid
officers doing?
Did you inform them?
I did... but, they're objecting to
go to that place
Upto 5 miles, it's Indian Boundary-
Sir, beyond that, it's International Boundary
That senior person after hearing the news
has gone to that place...
Message has come...
Affection between human beings
can never be faulted
You can't leave it like that...
Then, what are we here for?
Affection has no Religion, Caste
or Language...
We should get order from
the Central Govt.
Sri Lankan line Commission has to give permission...
Only we have put the
Boundary here...
When we see other's sufferings...
Our eyes will shed tears!!
Let Humanism be the essence
of National Anthem!!
Let them sing it!!
Oh Friend! will you come?
...To save some lives...
It's enough if some persons
live with expectations...
Who are they? Their identity is not important!
They're human beings like us...
There's no need to postpone
All are living beings...
And hurt is equal for everyone
Here, Flag of mercy has hoisted...
Greetings...
I'm also like you...
If they have any problem, I
can't bear it
After hearing the news
- I ranged up here & there...
But, they talked about rules...
I heard that you've come here...
I believed that you'll
save them
Thank you very much...
Sir, Greetings...
I'll not say 'thanks' to you...
This is your duty!!

There was a telegram
Stating"you are transferred to
Madras Court, come & join immediately"
He felt upset

After being friendly with you

Everyone is fine in your camp
Isn't it?
Your father, mother, grandparents and
your K.S. Raja?
Just for a fun!
Had your breakfast?
No... Do you like to have?
It's falling & my life is
getting drenched
Is this the dew or
the first rain?
Something is falling on
my heart
I was unaware of the relationship
in which I was involved
Even I experienced the happiness
which I was unaware of
It's you who changed me
You're hiding something
in your mind
Reveal it frankly
Why did you come here
by crossing the shore?
There's some secret
in your eyes
I've lost my heart somewhere
on the way
I've found that in your
eyes now
Till now, there were no addresses
for me
I've found that in your
smile now
I'm living by your
breath
Hey waves, why do you
move with trinklets?
Hey, what's the matter?
Reveal it
Waves, why do you rush
to the shore?
Why do you think of the
holding the moon?
Why so... Why so?
My path follows you & it ends
where you ends
My nights weep for the dawn
by looking at your face
You've changed day & night
You erected yourself
in my heart
I got drowned in your
eyes
Greetings!
Uncontrollable hammerage has
taken place
Internal bleeding is
heavy
We've saved her life
But there's no chance for her to
recover the normal way
Sir, I've asked her
many times
Only a word... ask her to reveal the
person's name
If she says?
Sir, this isn't like other
cases
If we take this to court
he will get 7yrs R. I
Don't speak like mad
7yrs?
To the one who spoiled
the girl's life
And this's the punishment which you're
going to give him, Isn't it?
And inbetween the 7yrs
you mentioned
There may be the birthdays and
deathdays of the politicians
Half of it will be commuted
this way
After eating 3 squares nicely
when he comes out
He'll be waiting for
another girl
Then, what should we do?
Without allowing anyone to have that
thought, we've to chop their...
Why should these rogues be a
burden on this earth?
Come on... kill him...
Law'll punish him! God'll look after
him
I can't stay quiet
Everything should take place
at the correct time
Already there're many cases
Warrant is pending
We should answer the court
This's a crucial murder
It has been made a big issue by
publishing it in the papers
Nothing... Ask him to
surrender
Even you know very well
this case won't stand
Let him be in the jail
for 15 days
You need a person, Isn't it?
You take him
That's... sir...
Hey, what man?
Who do you think he is?
Go back...
I don't want...
Hey, go at the side
Stand in the queue
Go...
Go this side
Madam, get down
Madam, get down...

whole heartedly
Thanks a lot
My daughter is, now the daughter-in-law
of the Tamilnadu
Hey Go... He's calling you...
Hey Go...
Hey Go...
You agree to this, Isn't it?
Hey thief... Tell me where did you
see him?
What did you speak first?
Tell us the entire truth
On the shore, I was waiting
for him
He came slowly... and...
what's lie in this?
This's the beautiful country where
golden fish sings on full moon night
The girl who has come here to live
from that place, please sing
When we were worrying that there's
no one to support us
Tamilians are always Great!
We roamed all over the streets
of Nallore
We ran behind the
chariot
We should think that there's no
sea in between us
Even our country & this country
is the same
Tamilian is really great!
Sister, will we get
new dresses?
Our relationship is only within
our country
We've surmised wrongly
like that
We've relations even here
Tamilian's are very generous
You're no loser
You became the daughter-in-law in
the place, you've come to
I can see the new bridge
Without any blemish
live happily
Thief... the day when you both
join hands
Then, only our life'll
blossom
Even if it disappears in the West
lt'll rise in the East
Even our dawn'll seen in
those sun rays
I thought that the dreams
are mine
Today, I've come to know
When the darkness goes
Even your dreams'll
come true
Fall at her feet
immediately
Your son is going to marry her
her name is Kalyani
She wants to meet her
mother-in-law immediately
She was troubling me
since morning
Okay, why to postpone the
good thing?
So I came here to discuss
& decide about it
Okay, bless the daughter-in-law
Chitra, where's the
prayer room?
That is... There...
There...
My lover's world...
Mother's character is like
that only
Do you like to have
coffee or something?
Don't want
You look at your own son
stealthily
Do you look even at your daughter-in-law
like that, she's your daughter-in-law
Come... Come
Look at her...
Look at her
How is her complexion?
Can we find a girl like her, even if our
whole clan does penance?
After getting them both married
if you keep your son with you
You can live happily like that
Queen Elizabeth
Instead, you're selling beads
in the hot sun
By thinking about it your son is
getting worried
And he's hitting the person
whoever gets trapped
But you won't understand it
okay forget it
Put the vermillion
Mother, put it

That intention is called
the life line
Please come to the matter
This problem should be concluded
today
Even everyone wishes that only
Isn't it?
This was started long back
Isn't it?
Including babies who're coming here
can't bear their sufferings
It should be concluded
we should conclude this
No one will object to this
decision
Yes sir, you said it right
Like before I couldn't operate
openly in this matter
Police... Customs... Navy
Vigilance is more now, they are
very strict now
Everyone is aware of your popularity
position & respect
Everyone dances to your tunes
Now, I need a place
lt'll be comfortable for us
if it's your place
It's not possible
Won't you worry if something
happens?
I'll worry...
Everyone has so many worries
You are telling me so
many things, Isn't it?
I forgot to tell you
one thing
Actually, I'll keep them in your place
& then shift them
That's all
You're from the clan, who offers
all help at once when asked
Birds of the same feather
flock together
By believing that you may've that
feeling, so I came here
I've attachment for language, caste
& feelings
More than you people have
Those who've come here to
save their lives
I'm helping them
The officers who objects to it by
stating law etc... I'm opposing them
That doesn't means, I'm
opposing the Govt.
And I'm not a traitor
Oh God! I didn't mean that
That's it, please think
about it
Even if the mother & children
are one
Their stomachs & breaths are
different, Isn't it?
Even I've 2 families
They respect us only if we've
money, Isn't it?
Can everyone be like you?
Get up, man
Hey, Get up
If you try to earn money
with this problem
I'll slipper you!
Neck him out
Unnatural death
Since, he has not performed
his father's last rituals
Those bad dreams are recurring
because of that only
Last rituals should be performed
for the dead
It's son's duty to perform
the rites & anniversaries
If they fail to perform
them
Son's will face calamities
After doing the oblation
of Lord Narayana
They should've sacred bath
in Holy water & then worship
Coming Dec.7th, on the new moon day
is the ceremony day
Morning at 10 AM, it's the
most auspicious time
Before the time elapses fulfill
the long pending last rites
If you postpone this again
Bad dreams may continue and may
death befall on the mother also
Let the relationship between mother
and son be smooth
Oh! Goddess! bless everyone
Do you've this habit?
No...
This is a bad habit
Hey, don't run!
Hey, catch me, if you can
What's all this at this time?
Go & sleep
Where has son-in-law gone?
He has gone to the Collector's Bungalow
regarding free meals
Oh! Now, has it become
a Collector's bungalow?
Did his father build it?
We had donated it, you know
isn't it?
I know
Sit down
Okay, forget it
How's your girl?
What's her name?
What is her name?
She's a beautiful girl
Atleast talk to
her smilingly
Buy & give her whatever she wants
Keep her happy
Conclude your marriage
immediately
Government will provide only food
and shelter
But life...
Only, you should give it
What should you give?
I should give life
Eat!
No, you eat
- Why these formalities?
Won't I feel happy if
you call me informally?
Eat man! Mad fellow
Why're you fidgetting with it?
eat nicely
Shouldn't you've a
good physique?
Did you see this?
It should be like this
Not only physical, but you should
be strong mentally also
I shouldn't tell you this
You're the one who came chopping it
just on a hint from me, isn't it?
My name isn't Sivagami
but Dhamayanthi
Your Grandpa had too much of
Juice, isn't it, that's why
You come...
We can call them as boy! just
out of affection only
But, I was worrying that
I don't have a son
Now, I don't have that worry
Bring it, man
Enough!
Enough means?
Do you mean that we'll
talk the rest of it tomorrow?
I didn't mean that
Go, man
You should live happily
As & when Evil surfaces on the Earth
I'll take an incarnation & vanquish it
What man?
Are you wondering that why am I
chanting hymns like priest?
Sit down
Do you know the meaning
of this hymn?
In this world whenever Evil
overpowers Good
I'll take an incarnation
We both are nothing but
those incarnations
What do you take us to be?
We're Gods
Those who get angry against
injustice are God
For this, will God come
separately?
Incarnation
Kill all those who commit
mistakes
No one can destroy you
you'll become immortal
We'll go automatically once our
work is accomplished
I'll be your companion
I'll stand by you
...Always
Think nicely
I was a witness for your marriage
as well your husband's death
When I heard that he's studying
after coming out
I felt very happy
But, do you know what he's doing?
and where he's now?
I'll not blame him
If you had kept him with you &
showered motherly love on him
Why'll he go there?
Begetting such a good son, do you want
to give him in adoption to the palace?
Elder person is a good man
He's doing good to
the people
But, that good man will be having
few enemies, isn't it?
Your son's life is in
danger
You should do me a favour
Tell me what do you want?
He won't ask me for anything
Atleast you've asked me
I want my son...
...Alive...
I lost my senses...
That I didn't look after him
by keeping him with me
He was never happy since
his birth...
At least, if he stays away
from me...
I thought he'll be happy
The path which he's taking
is frightening me
Not for my sake
Atleast for these two
he must be alive
lt... never striked me
Father...
What happened, father?
Shall I bring the
injection?
Someone please come
What's happening to you
father?
What happened?
It seems there's some blockage
in blood vessels
They've suggested an
emergency surgery
His life is out of
danger
But he'll be kept in Cardiac
I.C.U. for 48 hrs.
No one should disturb him
Everyone is waiting for
you there
You go, you shouldn't
postpone these things
He said that, Mother's life
will be in danger
First accomplish it!
Watch out, everything will be good
after this
If you had done in proper time even
this wouldn't have happened?
Go...
Go...
Inner soul of the soul is the companion
Master of Inner conscience
Son of North of Madurai, Oh! Magician
Ascetic of the Holy Yamuna River
Divine Lamp given by the Yadava Caste
to spread light all over the world
Oh! God! you're the one, who taught
the Mother herself about birth
Coming into this world as Pure, we
worship after wandering agitatedly
You're the Red fire which consumes
this body & reduces it to Ashes
You stand there as the Ultimate refuge
from this false & Misdemeanor world
Chanting your name, we've come to
worship you whole heartedly
Nandhini, ls breakfast ready?
Leave her...
Who did it? -What?
Who did it?
Elder man had an
heart attack
Tell me the truth
Which truth?
Hey! I'll wipe out your
entire family
Hey, go man...
Go & ask his son-in-law
Would you like to
eat?
What?
Durai, why're you getting
scared to death now?
Be quiet man
what do you know?
That man, before dying has
incited him
...Loose Tongued man
I feel he's going to be a
thorn in your flesh
When he enters your house &
troubles your wife
That time you'll come
to know
You don't show your face
outside for sometimes
A Policeman who's standing
there, isn't it?
Go & bash him up
It's a non-bailable offence to
hit a constable on duty
Be in a Jail, safely
for 15 days
Is it right?
Do whatever you feel
like doing
Are you going, Durai?
Sir, what's this? why're you
hitting me?
I don't want anyone
I believe only in myself
Go away boys!
What?
You shouldn't have come here
Not only now
Forever
Forget my existence
also
It won't work out
Hey, please don't
You've suffered terribly for the
inadvertent mistake you committed
Only now, everything is
working out well
Don't spoil it
Is it an advice?
I don't know
I'm a crack pot
But, you also think for a while
Mother, Chitra & everyone is
dependent on you
Look, where will she go?
Get lost
Am I the only man?
Go
Go, marry someone &
get ruined
It's better to kill her yourself
than talking to her like this
If you stay here any further
I'll even do that
You kill me yourself
Did I come here alive escaping
from death, for this?
Why're you crying?
what did I do?
Did I ever touch you?
Do I know your threshold?
Or do I know my mother's threshold?
Why're you after blood like
a vampire fox?
If you talk any more, I'll
break your other leg also
Take her away from here
For you only...
Go... Get lost...
BEAST!
You'll not escape from her sins
you're going to be ruined
Hey, you won't face a
good death
You'll meet a grim death
Now, what has happened?
They've arrested him just
only on suspicion
It seems it can't be
proved in the Court
I've made enquires all
around, isn't it?
And even it's proved, he'll
be sentenced for 5-7 years only
You'll wait for him, isn't it?
Oh! God! this is enough
We don't want this town where the
world comes to wash off its sins
Let him come
We'll go away to some
God forsaken place
Against our accused Nandha
Ramanathapuram Police Commissioner
has filed a charge sheet
The accused Nandha...
And 7 others who resembled him...
...An identification parade
was also conducted
This is an unfortunate insult to
Police & Justice Departments
Giving benefit of doubt in favour
of the accused Nandha
Judging he's innocent, I'm releasing
him from this case
Hey deaf! Didn't I tell you they'll
release him earlier itself
Did you see?
He has come back
Why're you sitting like this?
We're going to Madras
Pack everything
Brother
I'm warning you, don't bring
these & insult me
Come...
For my level, I'm forced to pack
all these stupid things
Mother, I'm hungry...
Sit down, mother
Make it fast
Sister-in-law, even you're coming
with us, isn't it?
Sister-in-law? You mustn't
call her like that
Only after marraige you should
address her like that
When is our marraige?
We'll think about it
after January
I knew, mother
Won't life forms on the earth search
for their mothers who gave them life
Mother, if I die on your lap
Even that'll be a happiness for me
