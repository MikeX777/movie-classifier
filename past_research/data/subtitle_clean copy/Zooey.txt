Wait, don't run away.
Come back here.
Don't run away.
A pet or a monster?
Wherever he
is, I've got to find him,
if I have to search every
street, every house,
every alley, every inch of this...
Come back.
Hey, boy, where are you?
Where are you, pal?
Come here.
Noah?
- Did you wipe the tires off?
- Yes, Owen.
Oh, okay.
Shoes.
Yo, I can start this over,
if you wanna watch it.
It's a good one.
This woman, she was walking
her dog late one night,
and then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she gets sucked up into the
sky by extraterrestrials.
Now, when she was a kid,
the same thing happened
to her younger brother,
but he was just five.
Now, while she was in this lost spaceship,
she found her long, lost younger brother,
but he was still five.
Oh, man, had I been abducted,
I would never want to come back.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, I just
missed you, that's all.
Uh-uh, now I know you're lying.
Grab me a soda from the fridge.
Geez, what are you, 13?
You out of school already?
It's summer, idiot.
Oh, shit.
Ah, ah, what time is it?
Is that the time?
Oh, Noah, get on your coat.
We've gotta go.
Come on, let's go, Noah,
let's go, let's go, let's go.
Oh, shit, let's go, get up, come on, man.
What are you doing, kid?
Hey, let's go, let's go.
- Ah, there he is.
- Hey, Joe,
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Ah, don't sweat it.
Right, we've got a lot to go out today.
Almost forgot.
- That one's kind of heavy.
- Okay.
Yup, you weren't kidding.
- Got it?
- Who me?
Yeah, of course.
Now, remember, if you
got comics, I want 'em.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Nostalgia's a powerful drug.
Sure is.
Later, Joe.
Bye.
Thank you.
Number 46.
Head out, let's go, huh?
Hey,
man, don't drop the package.
We need that.
Boy, I love this weather.
Oh, no, we don't want magazines or...
It's cool, it's just a package.
Oh, sweet, one sec.
- Me?
- Yeah, you heard me.
He wants you to fix the bell.
Oh, it's just a pinball machine.
Well, listen, why don't
you let me get Arland?
He's got all the tools.
He knows all about it.
I don't know.
Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
- Have a good one.
Where the tips?
Good?
- Hungry?
- Starving.
My man.
Where the hell do
you think you're going?
- What's it to you?
- No, no,
we're not done talking yet.
Yeah, well, I am.
You don't make the rules
around here, you got I?
Get off of me.
I'm telling you, man, it was a dead body.
- No way, man.
- He put it in that car.
No way, you're making this up.
Listen, it looked like
he put a girl in that car.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I think you've been watching
too many scary movies, kid.
Shut up.
Hey, dude, that's expensive, man.
Come on.
Get out the way, get out the way.
Oh, this key's not working.
You okay?
Just please don't let him in.
Hey, hey, everything's
going to be okay, all right?
I won't let him anywhere near you.
Oh, shit.
I know you're in there.
Hey, go to the bathroom,
go, go, go, go, go, go.
Come on, I'm just here for the kid.
Ah, what's up, my brother?
You seem very angry.
Where's the kid?
Huh, what, what?
Listen, I don't know who you are
but give me my goddamn kid and
stay the hell away from him,
- got it?
- Sir,
I think you have the wrong room, sir.
, you goddamn fool.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You good?
Yeah, I'm fine, why?
Well, everything go okay?
What do you mean?
The delivery.
Oh, yeah, that,
just peachy.
Peachy?
Dude, you're weird.
Leave me alone.
Oh, why today of all days?
I just want sleep.
- Can I help you?
- No.
Yes, actually.
One moment.
Do you mind?
- Yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh.
Mm-hmm.
What the hell were you doing in my room?
Well, look, I swear,
I didn't even know that you were in there.
He dropped his room key.
Yeah, yeah, you should
totally have it back up.
I'm sorry about that.
I saw him walking around
with dirt and stuff in there
and he never really talks to anyone.
I thought that I saw him carry
a dead body into his car,
and I don't know, just the
whole thing looked really shady.
Shady?
Yeah, like maybe he's
a killer or something.
My brother?
Yeah, I don't know.
He's not.
Okay, well, that's cool, I guess.
I just wasn't feeling good,
and the dirt's for the bath, obviously.
It's not that strange.
Oh, no, no, I've heard of
people take mud baths and stuff
because it's supposed to be
good for your skin and stuff,
but I've just never really done that.
Yeah, I always shower.
Not always.
I don't shower all the time.
I don't have some sort
of a weird odor problem
or anything like that.
I'm a clean person.
I shower the normal amount.
Gotcha, well, look,
whatever your name is,
don't come into my room again, got it?
Yeah, of course.
Noah.
What?
I'm Noah.
Yeah, I just thought you should know.
Zooey.
Nice to meet ya.
What?
Who was that?
Nobody.
Does nobody have a name?
- Just forget it.
- All right, fine.
If you don't wanna share.
I just walked into the
wrong room, that's all.
It's a motel.
- There's numbers on the door.
- Yeah, just drop the subject.
I'm off, I'm off.
She was cute.
Shut up.
Oh, sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.
No, no, it's fine, really, totally.
It's fine.
So you planning on swimming?
What?
Oh, no.
Oh, I get it, you
don't know how to swim.
Oh my God, you actually
don't know how to swim.
It's fine.
Nobody taught me.
How about you?
Well, I wouldn't come to the pool
if I didn't know how to swim.
I did.
Ah, okay,
I'm just gonna have to go in.
I can do this, okay.
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
it just looked like you were
maybe drowning or something.
I don't know.
You were just under there
for a very long time.
Were you gonna jump in?
- Well, I was...
- Zooey.
What were you thinking?
You can't just run off like that.
I didn't run off.
I went to go swim.
I don't care where you went.
What if something happened?
You're being paranoid.
I'm being cautious, Zooey.
Do you want to spend the
rest of your time in a place
that doesn't understand you?
A place that'll hurt you until it does?
No.
Because that's what's going to happen
if somebody finds out.
I'm just trying to keep you safe.
If anything were to happen to you, I...
Just please?
You don't have much more time.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Who was that out there?
Just some kid.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You're weird, kid.
Don't go in there for awhile.
Extraterrestrials.
Can't sleep, huh?
Milkshake time, let's go.
What time?
You heard me, it's milkshake time.
Go, let's go.
Come on.
Ow, brain freeze.
Oh, I love milkshakes.
So?
What?
That girl.
- Zooey?
- Bingo.
She has a name.
Shut up.
Oh, man, so how's she doing?
- Fine.
- Oh, you think she's fine?
That is not what I said.
Oh, man,
to be young again, chasing girls around.
You did a lot of girl chasing?
Nope.
Just aliens then?
Yo, wait, is that...?
Yo, what is that?
That's a freaking UFO.
That's a goddamn...
Wait, my bad, that's a plane.
Anyway, I'm happy for you, kid, truly.
You should ask her out.
Oh, man, I don't know about you,
but all this sugar's making me tired.
Ready to go?
Let's do it.
Yes, dear, what is it?
When I came to your
place, it was because of...
Yes?
I just arrived here.
I did not know where else to go,
but everything was so strange to me.
I'm glad you came, so is grandpa.
Gotta meet family and friends.
Hey.
Hey.
So what's up?
Nothing.
Okay, guess I'll see you later then.
Oh, wait, wait,
I came over here to ask you
if you wanted to go see
something or go do something?
Go out to do something with me?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, okay, cool.
I'll just go and find with
something for us to do.
I'll get back to you.
Sounds good.
For awesome.
For awesome?
For awesome.
Mind if I sit?
Plenty of room.
You live next door, right?
Taylor?
Yeah.
Owen.
Want a beer, Owen?
Yeah, yeah.
- So...
- They can't be together.
Zooey doesn't have time
to be playing around
with your little Noah.
What do you mean?
They're pretty good together.
Yeah, that's the problem.
It's not gonna work, it can't work,
so there's no point in them both
getting their feelings hurt.
But isn't that just a process though?
They're young.
It's not like they're going
to be together forever.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
You're fine.
No, it's okay.
Zooey's got a condition
and we don't have much longer,
so we just drove,
figured we'd see the country.
I'd never been further
west than Wisconsin,
so you know what's in Wisconsin?
Cheese?
Yeah, yeah, and nothing else.
- So you're just gonna...
- Just gonna go.
We figured we'd just really go.
This can't be the
final destination though.
No, no, it is nice though.
Yeah?
She picked it.
That'll be great.
So how long's she have left?
I don't know, I don't know,
a couple of weeks or less.
You can finish the beer.
Okay, I want to show you something,
but you have to promise
not to scream or anything?
What?
Promise.
Okay, I promise.
Oh, hey, that's...
You're a...
What are you?
I'm not from here.
Does anybody else know?
Just my brother.
This is amazing.
Can you do that tongue thing again?
What?
No.
This is crazy, crazy.
My girlfriend is an alien.
Hang on, girlfriend?
Did I say girlfriend?
No, no.
What I meant to say was...
No, no, I like it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It just seems right.
I have so many questions.
Where are you from?
I don't know.
Oh, and the mud baths.
Is that how you feed or something?
No.
Can you breathe under water?
Oh, oh, oh, can you fly
or do you have super
strength or something?
Wow.
So out of all the places,
why in a motel?
Before I was adopted by Richard,
he found me here.
I guess my parents just
left me there on the steps.
I don't know, dude.
I just feel like I've
always felt at home here,
more than any other place anyway.
I didn't know my parents either.
I always thought,
out of all the places they
could've left me in the galaxy,
they chose here.
Your brother, is he...?
No, he just found me,
saved me.
He never told anyone what I was.
He always protected me.
What about your parents?
Do you think they'll ever come back?
It doesn't matter anymore.
It doesn't matter?
What's that supposed to mean?
I just don't care.
Do you think your parents
are out there somewhere?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Well, I'm glad now that
my parents left me here.
I'm happy.
Mm, whoa, man.
Why you so smiley?
We live about 20 steps
from her door to mine.
I think I'm in love.
Whoa, hold up, love?
Like love love?
Yeah.
Shit,
what's it like?
It's really weird.
Yeah, well, considering
the circumstances.
I just don't even know
what to do with my life.
What?
- What's so funny?
- You don't know what to do
with your life.
Kid, I'm 30 years old,
living out of a motel,
using an empty chip bag
as a damn trashcan liner,
not to mention the only socializing I do
is with a 14 year old.
And whose fault is that?
Entirely mine.
No, wait, so tell me what happened.
Oh, that's what you're going...
You're not going to tell me?
You're just going to...
Okay, okay, all right, fine.
No donuts for you.
Get out of here.
I can see why you like this stuff.
It's so...
Sugary?
Yeah.
Here, have one of these.
It's always been one of my favorites.
Your eyes...
I've just never seen them like that.
Yeah, they do that sometimes.
No, it's beautiful.
I can't believe you've
never had any of these.
Yeah, my brother
doesn't really allow it.
That sucks.
One time, Owen and I got a huge
bucket full of these things
and we downed it in 15 minutes.
Owen?
Yeah, the guy I live with.
Oh, your brother.
Not exactly.
He's like family.
Like family?
Is, I guess, is family.
Here, try one of these.
I do have to warn you though,
they tend to get a little bit...
Oh, no.
Sour.
Noah.
Sorry, Owen.
Boy, you and that girl,
you're lucky, mm-hmm,
but you not sleeping
here tonight, go on home.
So what's going on?
Here.
Zooey, what are you doing with those?
Aren't you a little curious?
About what?
To try it, dummy.
No.
Okay, fine, it doesn't smell too bad.
What if you're allergic
to it or something?
I don't have any problems with gluten.
That's not what I'm talking about.
It's fine, Noah, here, try some.
No.
Fine, you're going to
make me drink alone then.
Oh, nice, peer pressure now.
Suit yourself.
Why do we adults drink that?
I honestly don't know.
You can finish it.
After all that,
you honestly think that
I'm going to want some?
Let's go do something else.
Oh my God.
Owen, hey, what's going on?
I think I might have something for you.
Okay, let's have a look.
Oh, wow,
I haven't seen one of these
come in here for quite a while.
Where'd you get it?
I had it since I was a kid.
It was my first comic.
You sure?
You sure you want to sell?
I do.
Yeah.
Okay, well, the last
one we had come in here
was pretty beat up, let me tell you.
Still, it went for quite a bit,
but since this one's
mint, or basically mint,
probably looking at...
- Bull shit.
- No, sir.
What?
I know a guy who would
buy this in a heartbeat.
Who?
- Me.
- Really?
You say the word, I'll get
my cheque book right now.
You promise to
take good care of it, yeah?
Of course.
Let me get my cheque book.
Zooey.
It's okay, just breathe.
Hey, just breathe.
You're doing okay.
You'll be okay.
Keep breathing, okay, okay.
Zooey's busy right now.
Yeah, okay, I was just...
,
my sisters are calling.
Wake up, wake up now.
Our sisters are awake.
They're hungry.
They've slept it off.
It's time to go into the sea.
Zooey?
Where you been?
Are you just gonna ignore me like that?
I didn't even know you were coming.
Yeah.
Do you want to go somewhere?
Can we just sit and talk?
Yeah, sure.
I came over and knocked earlier...
I know.
He just seemed pretty upset with me.
It's not you.
Really?
Sometimes he just gets like that.
Like what?
Stressed out, mad or something,
usually because of me.
I'm sure it's not always because of you.
You're just saying that.
No, I'm really not.
Look, Noah,
I don't think we should see each other.
What, you don't think...?
Why not?
We can't hang out, not anymore.
Is it Taylor?
No, it's not my brother.
What did I do?
You didn't do anything.
It's just because it's what I want.
I don't understand.
It's what's best for me.
Okay.
New, bold, daring, I hate it.
Yo, you all right?
Talk to me, kid.
Zooey doesn't want to see me anymore.
Why? What happened?
I don't know.
I guess I'm just not good enough.
Oh, what the hell are you talking about?
She's just so special.
I'm just me.
No way.
I should have known.
Why would anyone like her
wanna be with someone like me?
Hey, what are you talking about?
He's right.
Who's right?
- Richard.
- Oh, no, no.
- He's always been right.
- Hold on.
I'm just a piece of shit.
Hold on.
- It's all I am.
- No, hey,
look at me.
I know you're not about to believe a word
that comes out of that asshole's mouth.
He's right.
No, he's wrong, Noah.
When he says stuff like that,
that has nothing to do with you.
It has everything to do with him.
Since when are you the expert?
Trust me, I know.
My parents were the same way.
As hard as it may seem, we
just can't believe that shit.
You gotta focus on you
and what makes you great,
because you are great.
Cool?
What?
It's not that weird.
It is that weird.
A little, yeah.
Point is, Richard's a loser.
You're nothing like him.
Who?
My man.
What?
Get away from me with all that, dude.
My mustache?
Yeah, shave it off and
then you can come back.
God, come give me a hug, man, at least.
- Stop.
- Show your boy some love.
- Stop.
- Oh.
I knew it, God damn it.
I knew you were staying
at that guy's house.
His name's Owen.
I don't give a shit what his name is.
Do you know how long you've been gone?
You tell me, asshole.
Hey, watch your mouth.
It's been weeks.
What do you care?
Excuse me?
You've never given a shit about me.
Say the same for you.
- Come on, let's go.
- Ow, Owen.
- Shut up.
- Owen.
Hey, Noah, we've
got some more deliveries.
Where you at, man?
Give me a call back as soon as you can.
All right, bye.
Noah, you are way late, man.
Okay, are you with Zooey again?
Give me a call.
All right, bye.
Yo, it's Owen.
I found your bike, man.
Did Taylor give you two a ride somewhere?
Give me a call.
Noah, Zooey's here.
What's going on?
I'm coming, kid, just hang on.
What do you want?
To break you out of here, kid.
Come on, let's get you out of here.
What about Richard?
Oh, I think he's preoccupied.
Hey, oh, sorry.
Come on.
What's the point?
What do you mean?
He's just going to keep on coming back.
I'm not even getting any sleep,
just worrying about the next time he...
He hits you?
We're going to call
Child Protective Services or something.
I don't wanna cause anymore problems.
Problem?
No, no, no, you're not
causing the problem, he is.
Please, don't.
Okay, I think I know we're gonna do.
What do you mean?
I've got an idea, but
I need you to watch.
What's your idea?
- I'm gonna fight him.
- What?
Yeah, come on, let's go quickly,
before I realize how stupid this is.
Wait, okay.
Eye of the tiger.
- Hey.
- What?
What the hell are you doing in my house?
I'm taking Noah with me.
Like hell you are.
You heard me.
You think I'm just gonna let you go?
Yeah.
Are you an idiot?
Probably.
So let me get this straight,
you come into my house,
you try to take my kid
and you think I'm just gonna
let you walk out the door?
Why don't you try and stop me?
Go, go, go, go, go.
Oh, shit, oh, go, go, go, go, go.
There's the car, there's
the car right there.
Where's my keys?
Why'd you make me watch that?
I needed a witness.
Now I need a payphone.
911.
What a day, huh?
Yeah.
I never thought
I'd get my first black eye this way.
First?
Yeah.
It doesn't surprise me.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't want to be the
guy who gets hit by you.
Hey,
I'm thinking about buying
some land out in the valley.
Either you can help me get it started...
Do you want me to work
for you or something?
No, no, no,
you could come help do some chores.
You're asking me to move in with you?
No, what, you crazy?
Yeah, I am actually.
Yeah.
Okay,
but no talking during my alien movies.
You and those damn movies, dude.
You'll grow to love them, watch.
Is that so?
Mm-hmm, just give it time.
You okay?
Yeah.
Sure?
I think so.
Let's go.
What time is it?
It doesn't matter.
Let's go.
Why?
Wake up.
Through the window?
This summer with you,
it's been awesome.
For awesome.
So I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah.
See ya.
Bye, Noah.
No, no, no, no, no.
Dear,
Noah, I wasn't really sure
what to put down here,
but I knew that I had to say something,
even if I couldn't directly.
Goodbyes have never been hard
for me, but this one hurts,
and I hope that you
won't hold it against me.
When Taylor and I came out here,
I didn't think I'd end up meeting anybody,
and there was this stupid
boy who broke into my room.
Well, that's everything.
All right.
Being
with you has made my time here
really, really special,
but it also makes what's about
to happen so much harder,
because I think that, in some kind of way,
I feel like maybe I love you.
Maybe in a while, you and Owen
could check on Taylor for me.
Give him some time,
but I know he'll need somebody to talk to,
somebody that really knows.
Goodbye, Noah, and thank you.
Yours, Zooey.
