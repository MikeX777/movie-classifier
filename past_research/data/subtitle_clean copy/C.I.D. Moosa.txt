MAY 19.
I Ravi Menon,
I Ravi Menon, son of Shankar Menon
of Manika MangaIam....
with the duty conscious,
without hypocrisy,
with sincerity and honesty,
I'II withhoId sovereignty
and pride of this country,
As the Chief Minister Of KeraIa,
whatever comes to my knowIedge...
without any partiaIity
I'II treat everyone as equaI.
I swear in the name of god.
Long live Mr. Ravi Menon.
How come there's a hoIe
suddenIy in my cap?
If you ask me genuine questions.
Then I can answer you easiIy.
You were the Home Minister.
Why did you suddenIy
become the Chief Minister.
High command decided
and I obeyed.
Who are the new Ministers?
I wiII announce it Iater.
Since you received threats
twice as a Minister,
it seems Kerala police has arranged
tight security for you.
Is it?
That's our responsibiIity.
Tomorrow they'II go
to the city saying,
a Iong convoy of escort vehicIes
for the Chief Minister.
''Iakhs of money is spent
on his security''.
Hey, this is KeraIa.
As an escort, one jeep wiII do.
Sir, that's...it's our duty.
Are you afraid that
somebody wiII kiII me?
If somebody pIans to kiII me,
Who can rescue me?
Are you repIica of James Bond?
Are you pet of SherIock HoImes?
Are you a fiery jet?
Are you a atom bomb?
Let's meet at the India Gate.
Let's search the internet for HitIer.
Oh god! What's this?
That buIIet is coming on to me.
Let me step aside from it.
When he sees thieves before
him, he'II aim buIIets at them.
Crime Branch wiII beg for him...
CBI, CID's and VIP's in this city,
saIute him secretIy.
When he comes, peopIe shudder.
When he stands,
ashes wiII scatter.
He's the hot wind
bIowing everywhere.
Many songs top the charts.
When peopIe see you,
they start bIowing whistIes.
He's son of god.
Oh God! Shit, it was you.
Pish!
Was it a dream then?
Son, Sahadeva.- Yes mother.
About whom were you taIking now?
Mother...I...father....
Are you a father?
Not that....father
must have come, right?
He's there.
He has started taIking about
accounts from earIy morning.
Rs 2500 to be paid to the shop.
We couId've bought many pints
of Iiquor from that money.
Sugar, rice, saIt,
spices, eggs....
2 tins of power maIt.
Hercuries 5 bottIes. Sorry, horIicks.
This is somebody eIse's account.
No...this is our account onIy.
There's no guarantee I'II get
seIected in the written test,
passing the written test and
get the seIection.
I shouId pass the
physicaI test aIso.
Does it mean you've to
take so many eggs?
Do you've hook worms
in your stomach?
Son, are you eating to Iive,
or Iiving to eat?
No father shouId ever caIcuIate
son's food account.
But the shop keeper is
accounting me for that.
Sahadeva, inspite of
spending so much,
and if you don't pass
the physicaI test.
Just because CoIumbia
has been destroyed,
has America stopped
fIying rockets?
My son, this isn't America.
We're the poor who eat food
from American fIour?
Son, horIicks...
Thanks...- Have you taken it?
No bananas for you today.
No? No vitamins C
for me today.- Yes.
Vikrama, hearing this,
my Vitamin C is scooping out.
Take Vitamin 3x for that.
- Very good.
UntiI you stop drinking,
this famiIy wiII not prosper.
For exampIe, no banana today.
Forget that, do I've a good shirt,
pant or shoes?
Even if you don't have aII these,
You don't Iack means of IiveIihood.
That's okay, my ancestors had...
What?
You're the man
to spoiI my father.
Yesterday, I wasn't responsibIe
for his getting drunk.
He Iost his honour,
drinking continuousIy.
He's not respected at home
as weII as by the peopIe.
That honour is enough for him.
Hereafter don't try to raise it.
I beg you not to ruin our
famiIy befriending him.
My famiIy got ruined because
of your father's friendship.
I'd soId even my wife's auspicious
pendant to give him money.
You know my wife doesn't
aIIow me into the house.
I'm with Chandran's wife now.
I'm carrying the burden of
his 2 fiIthy chiIdren now.
I deserve this.
Brother, I'm Ieaving.
I wiII Ieave.
- Hey, go away man.
I'II Ieave...I'II not step
into this house again.
I'm not responsibIe for his drinking.
Your brother-in-Iaw S.I., ask him.
That idiot wiII not be abIe to bear
if your father doesn't saIute him.
I wiII teII you one thing.
If your bIoody brother-in-Iaw comes.
I'II not mind about your sister.
I'II hit him with cane
and stone him to death.
Who are you going to kiII?
That's...
I'II teII you.
Don't teII him.
An itchy dog is disturbing
my father for a Iong time.
We were teIIing that
we'II kiII it on sight.
Dog with a beIt around it's neck?
No...a Iong beIt
worn around it's waist.
That's about me!
- Yes sir.
Let's not have any
probIem between us.
You aII are famiIy members.
Are they? I'II not step
into their home.
AIong with this big time thief,
there's a smaII time thief, Kochunni.
I've come to take him away.
TempIe festivaI is going
to begin tomorrow.
OnIy if I put them in jaiI.
I can peacefuIIy watch the show.
Aren't you coming home, dear?
I was here onIy for Iong time.
AtIeast get in, pIease.
Is there goId?
She's not your daughter anymore,
but a poIiceman's wife.
She feeIs more proud to enter
that thiefs house than our's.
She can take away
anything from there.
No case wiII be fiIed against her.
- Get Iost you...
Don't tarnish your honour by
taIking to cheap...come...
Kochunni...my son.- Yes dad.
What is it dad?
Don't you know, my study time
is between 7 and 9?
PoIice has come to our threshoId.
- Poor poIice.
What a difficuIty!
So, this year's festivaI coIIection
is ''govinda''Iost).
Are you caIIing your father by name?
- I didn't caII your name.
I meant to say that we've Iost
this year's festivaI coIIection.
Look, they're caIIing,
teII them I'm not here.
Okay, my dear son.
Why did you take so much time
to open the door? - Since it was cIosed.
Trousers? Are you studying in LKG?
- No, this is GuIf.
No, his son robs onIy in
houses of GuIf returned peopIe.
I see.
Come on search.
PIease move.
Oh God! What am I seeing here?
It's Iooks Iike we've entered
duty free shop. - AII are free.
Now you start your duty.
You shouIdn't compIain that
I've not taken you to the shop.
What size Unni? - KochusmaII)Unni.
Where's he? - Not here.
Search the house.
Hubby, Iook at this.
- Take it.
Is it Japanese make?
No Rajappan's, from
southern fieIds.
Then, I'II take this.
Sir, somebody is
in the bathroom.
What a big hoIe!
Why're you barking?
What's your probIem?
That's Iack of stick.
I asked it not to bark.
Oh God! Who pIaced your head here?
Not onIy my head,
my body is aIso there.
I'II rip out your intestines.
Who permitted you to
enter the house?
I didn't enter the house
but inside the bucket.
Hey, get up.
Don't scream. Let poIice go away,
then I'II come out.
We're friends, aren't we?
- Friends?
You beIong to a thiefs famiIy and
I beIong to a poIice famiIy.
Our famiIies don't match.
If there're no thieves,
then no need of poIice.
Don't forget that.
I'II show you whether
there's poIice or not.
Have you caught him?
Can't find him any
where in the fieIds?
I'm sure, he's inside this house.
I'II break your knee if you
step into my house again.
He says this for me
and onIy for me.
Yes. Take him quickIy.
Or eIse I'II go away.
That's why, I don't come to
station when you caII me.
Put him into the jeep.
Hey don't catch me. My shirt is
Ioosening out...I wiII get in.
Brother-in-Iaw.
I respect you for onIy one thing,
when we couIdn't afford
to give any dowry,
and marry off my sister,
you eIoped with her
and married her.
As a brother, I'm gratefuI
to you for that.
Taking that as a chance, if you
try to troubIe my father,
then you'II know the true coIour
of this Sahadevan. Go...
Now, I'm confident that
you'II become S.I.
Go and get my shoes and pant.
No need to count...
Take it and buy.
How's this? - This is okay.
What's this?
What nonsense is this...
inside the shoe.
Where are you Iooking & waIking?
- Somebody had pushed.
Sorry...Iet me remove the shoe.
Where shaII I keep it?
I've seen stones in the rice.
But onIy for the first time.
I see it in the rock.
Has it started to rain stones
ever since I shaved my head?
Hey stop, the one at the top is mine.
Give it to me.
Hey stop! - Go...go...
Oh God! Car...
What is this?
- Nothing, okay sorry...
Are you pIaying hopping game
in the middIe of road?
Don't say anything more.
I've moved. PIease.
What a difficuIty?
I bought a shoe...stiII my
wish hasn't fuIfiIIed.
What wiII I do having this shoe?
How am I to face my father
without shoes?
What is this? Don't go steep.
Hey...shoe...hey, give that
to me and go.
Shoe...stop, I'II come.
PIease.- Go...go fast.
I say go fast.
Nothing to worry.
You'II not have any probIem,
if you get rid of B.P. too.
Better reduce your tension.
Asking the Chief Minister
to reduce his tension?
Now, mother and daughter
wouId have been satisfied.
Come...
Nothing is wrong with me dear.
She gets scared even
if I get a sIight fever,
fearing my death.
I'II die when I'm fated
to die, right doctor?
HeIIo!
I'm Ratan from DeIhi.
Baba is expecting you to convey

They've asked to ensure
burgIars don't break in?
Which burgIar can enter when

Do I've to wait?
Car might be insufficient.
There might be many things.

Taxi.

Do I've to caII the container?

Don't know in which form

You'II get it on next Friday.
Now I've no time.
Is there any necessity

So, we wear heImet to safeguard
ourseIves from getting beaten up.
Attender, why did you
stop the vehicIe?
We've reached the hospitaI.
Where they wouId've pIanted the bomb?
Might be in the mortuary.
Don't know how many innocents
are going to die in the mortuary?
If bomb goes off whiIe

Oh God, I haven't come to that stage.
Good.
It's very important for such
peopIe to join our department.
Why did you pIant the bomb
in hospitaI?
Sir, what do you mean?
Did I pIant the bomb?
Don't Iie.
I know you had pIanted it.
It's not justice sir.
TaIking justice to a poIice officer.
Don't hit me, I'm the one
who found the bomb.
Are you poIice to do that?
Sir, I had to do that in a crisis.
So, I couId save many Iives.
Didn't you read in the
papers highIighting,
the smartness of Sahadevan,
man who found the bomb,
and the dog is struggIing
for it's Iife in hospitaI.
It's in aII the news papers.
Did you do it for pubIicity?
I know you had pIanted,
found and defused it.
Sir, are you trying to
put the bIame on me?
RascaI, taIking arrogantIy?
Stop it.
He can reveaI the detaiIs
of the bomb bIast.
No, he's innocent.- No, he's not.
I inquired.
Instead of finding
the reaI cuIprits.
Sir, I can identify them.
I've seen them.
I'II catch them if you want.
- No need, poIice wiII do it.
You know the punishment

But don't repeat it.
You can go.

Thank you.
Hey you dog! You wanted me to

Saw this.
Mercy kiIIing! You deserve it.
This dog had toiIed hard
for your department.
Without even trying to save it,
You're trying to kiII it.
This is too much.
Don't taIk phiIosophy.
Inject it doctor.
No need. I'II inject it.
Don't dare to touch it.
Who are you to say that?
I may be anybody.
Do you know what's this?
- A paper.
Not just a pIain paper.- Then?
An order to stop kiIIing the dog.
And that I can rear it.
This is an order from Maneka Gandhi.
Let me see the order.
Maneka Gandhi's order can't be
shown to fake poIicemen.
Doctor, just a minute.
- You stand there.
Doctor, this isn't
Maneka Gandhi's order.
It's my request.
If you've conscience give the dog
to me without kiIIing it.
I'II take care.
Even I don't have a heart
to kiII it.- Then pIease...
Let me see, come.
Can I go against
Maneka Gandhi's order?

Can't you see from their bodies?

PoIice job wiII not suit oId
fashioned guys Iike you.
The criminaIs who're brave and
have muscuIar bodies Iike them.
Do you've the strength
to fight with them?
Now, am I fit sir?
Are you hitting the poIiceman, rascaI?
Why're the poIice so
angry on my son?
WouId anybody spare him
if he hits a poIiceman?
Son, have this.
I don't want this.
It'II not get digested anymore.
I'm dejected.
UnnecessariIy I had to spend
IavishIy my father's money...
For whom I'm earning aII this.
I just bIabber something when
I'm drunk.- No father.
I'm disrespected and
mocked wherever I go.
Mother, what if I try for
some other job?
Son...
You're getting dejected
for a siIIy thing first,
and were you trying to
become a poIice officer?
FaiIures are stepping
stones to success.
The disrespect and mocking,
are support for your desires.
You've to achieve your
aim utiIizing them.
I'm sure you'II achieve.
FaiIing to find the cuIprits
behind the bomb bIast,
is a shame to the
entire department.
Sir, the investigation
has been intensified.
But since criminaI's
attempt had faiIed,
I doubt that they wouId've
Ieft from our country.
No, their aim is to expIode and
spoiI the peace of our country.
So, I expect a series
of expIosions.
We've to be more carefuI.
Sir, our dog squad
is very weak.
We don't have an efficient dog
in our department now.
Arjun, hurt in the bIast and
struggIing for Iife. He's very smart.
Then re-induct the dog
back to the department.
It's impossibIe.
We had ordered for mercy kiIIing.
A man had taken it by the order
of Maneka Gandhi to rear it.
He's very arrogant.
- He's his brother-in-Iaw sir.
I've no such reIations.
He's my enemy.
Don't try to escape.
You've to bring back the dog again.
Sir...- No, it's an order.
PoIiceman is hacked to death.
It must be poIiceman had
hacked him to death.
Where's the dog?
- It's before me.
That means....- Our sir.
Where's the barking dog?
- It's barking before me.
I'm asking you about Arjun.
You've to ask Krishnan about it.
Are you fooIing me?
Is there any necessity
to make you one?
Where's your dog named Arjun?
Don't caII my ''dog'', a dog.
Then do I've to caII
it as ''father'' then.
If you've the habit of caIIing
Iike that. Then you can.
Hey catch father.
Hey, catch the dog.
What's the matter?
An order from the department.
Order?- Run. Yes order.
Order to send back the dog
to the department.
TeII your department that
I can't give back the dog.
What?- Nothing.
We know how to take the dog with us.
You needn't give.
Hey, search for the dog.
He has come to take you back
to the poIice department.
You want to go?
This isn't his barking.
But he's using choicest epithets.
ShaII I transIate it if you wish?
How did the dog Iearn aII this?
It was in poIice department.
It wasn't his urine.
But the protest.
It didn't pass it on the
ground but on your face.
If you stand here anymore.
Then he'II bring you into a
condition to inject round your naveI.
Then you can't taste Iemon pickIe
aII your entire Iife.
Oh God, what'II I Iick
when I drink Iiquor.
Then go away without
getting beaten up.
This dog.
Hey...
I'II Iose my job if I don't
take Mr. Arjun with me.
Give respect and
take respect Iike that.
If he's very much in need,
then I'm ready to sacrifice
him for this country.
Very happy.
TeII your department
I've few demands.
What are they?
Let me hear them.
One is, a fIat for
the dog to stay.
Dogs don't stay in fIats sir?
They stay in kenneIs, right?
He's asking for his stay.
UnnecessariIy, over expenses
for the Government.
You be quiet. Let him go ahead.
- Let him.
Second is, An AC car for
the dog to traveI.
No car for the S.I. here,
and you're asking
A/c car for the dog...you....
Hey...
Are your demands over?
No...- StiII more?
Dog has a menu.
- AII have it.
He has to take care
of my dog's menu.
Do I've to?
Ask your father to...
Hey Peethambaran.
- Heard what he said.
He's asking me to take care
of his dog's menu.
So far, I didn't take
care of my menu.
Stop it.
Let me see your menu.
Have you become so cheap sir?
This...horIicks, eggs, chicken...
miIk in the morning.
So this is it.
It's not the one I intended.
Butter...beef...soaked and
unsoaked 2 times.
With bread & omeIette,
chicken, chips.
Over?- No sir.
Ask 10 cents of Iand for the
dog to go for the toiIet.
No need, it's enough if you heIp it
when its about to go to the toiIet.
I don't know when my chiId
wouId go to toiIet.
How'II I know about the dog?
WiII the dog put the indicator
and show that it's toiIet time.
Sir, this wiII not work out.
He's insuIting me and my dog.
I'II not stay here
even for a minute.
Hey you be here.
- No, I'm Ieaving.
Let him go.
Hey, I say you stand here.
Hey, you move to that side.
You wanted to become
a sub-inspector.
You're angry on poIice for not
aIIowing you to become one, right?
Not on aII.
OnIy with few Ioafers who are
unfit to become poIice officers.
He's saying this for me.
OnIy for me.
WiII you stop it?
I've agreed to aII your demands.
Sir.
Thank you sir.
This is dog's fIat.
- Where's the bed room?
It may be somewhere there.
This is the dog's bowI.
Very good! OgIing at she-dog.
Move...Iet me aIso see.
Arjun...move, Iet me aIso see.
You can aIso caII me a ogIer.
Let me aIso see it.
I'm a human being.
Won't I've feeIings?
I'II teII father

Let the dog watch
the pIay of its son.
I aIso want to say the
same thing to my daughter.
HeIIo.
Hi.
I know that you've mistaken

I'm a poIiceman in fact.
It was the pIay of our department.
That's the way how we catch a thief.
Did you see him?
The character who was
with me that day.
He saIuted me.
He's my assistant.
What's the probIem Meena?
- Nothing.
He's taIking something.
I'm not abIe to understand.
Oh God! Is she a Hindi
speaking girI?
Oh God! I don't know Hindi.
I unnecessariIy wasted
many MaIayaIam words.
Any how her name is good.
Meena beti.
May be beti is her father's name.
Go away from me.
What?- Go away from me.
Saman katto...robbed my things).
No, I didn't rob your things.
Go away from me.
Oh God! I'm not that bad.
Hey, you know MaIayaIam, right?
Then why're you taIking
in Hindi to him.
If I taIk in MaIayaIam.
Then he'II stay behind me forever.
What's it?
Where are you taking me to?
7B...who does he have in 7B?
Who's it?- Don't know! You check.
Hi.
Oh, is this your fIat?
- What do you want?
Tea...
Oh That's it! You've caIIed me
to meet your she-dog.
What do you want?
Look Meena beti, my dog & your dog.
OgIe at each other...
My dog wants to marry your...
You want to get my JuIie married.
Yes, you've understood.
Your matter has worked out.
How am I to make her
understand my Iove?
You know EngIish.
- I don't know EngIish.
Don't you Iearn this?
Look girIy, our dogs match weII.
And this dog...oh no, I'm not dog.
This guy & your girIy.
Very very match.
Hey, don't pIay fooI with me.

How come you're in 12B?
- Previous tenants had shifted.
How come you're here?
I was staying here

I forgot to take them.
I'II take them and go away.
Oh! Theft.
Vikrama brother, caII 100.
Give me that 100 in cash.
I'm in a very tight position.
I've escaped from the jaiI.- Have you?
Mosquito torture.
Food is aIso not that

They behave with me Iike

Is jaiI your in-Iaw's house?
What type of cry is this?
- Not me...caIIing beII is ringing.
Do you've to Iaugh for that?
Now, it's me. I've onIy cried.
Open the door.
Brother-in-Iaw, here at midnight?
- Who's your brother-in-Iaw?
What's the matter?
You must come with
the dog immediateIy.
A man had escaped from the jaiI.
To sniff him and catch.
ShouId we aIso come?
- Dog is enough.
Then its enough if you go.
Kochunni had escaped
from the jaiI, right?
How did you know?
I know his whereabouts aIso.
He escaped from the jaiI.
PenuItimate day of his
6 month imprisonment.
Cheat! DisIoyaI person.
That has become a good chance for me.
I'II get promotion
if I catch him now.
Sure to get promotion?- Yes.
Then I'II not teII you.
You needn't get such promotion.
Then what about the dog?
Dog's job isn't to trace

I'II catch him without

Then catch him.
He's right at the tip of
your nose. I'II catch him.
This Peethambaran wiII catch him,
and beat him to puIp.
What's your name?- Name?
Not by mistake.
Yes, it was by mistake onIy.

Is this the hitting famiIy?
Sahadev, don't wash away
your hands off.
Have you? HoId it?
I'II stay here!
I don't want anything.
Father, can we Iet him stay here?
You've to take care
of the dog.
You've to brush dog's teeth,
take it to the toiIet,
and give a bath to it.
I needn't give a bath, if it
doesn't go to toiIet, right?
Just hear what he says.
If it can hear what he says,
then dog can take care of it's things.
PoIice visit here often, right?
They may catch me
if they identify my face.
They'II...but there's a way.
- What's it?
Let's change your Iooks.
How?- I'II show you.

I've not counted.
1 , 2, 3...
Coffee...coffee..
Oh God, did I sIeep in the
raiIway station Iast night?
Who are you?
I'm the one whom you had changed
my Iooks yesterday. Coffee.
You've become very smart.
Even poIice can't recognise you.
Why poIice?
I can't recognise myseIf Iooking in
the mirror.
What if I puII out
your 2 teeth?
KiIIing me is better than that.
I've come in search of
JuIie, she's inside.
Sorry....I've come to
the wrong fIat. You enter.
Hi, good morning.
I know you wouId come in search

Don't pIay fun with me?

It seems you've hidden

I'm not that bad person.
Your father must've...

No girIs are inside.
You know Hindi?
What? I was a chief in Bombay.

You take care of the dog.

Naukerservant).
That's his great grand father.
Why're you taIking high of me?

Oh, he has kiIIed me.
Stupid.
Who are you?
Sorry, I've come to the wrong fIat.
For the first time, I've had

Not on me but on your dog.
- Dog?
It's barking terribIy on the bed.
Saw?
Saw?
CaIm
Very obedient dog!
Hey shut up.
Why is he under the bIanket?
He must be having fever.
It has cough.
Look it's coughing.
I'II hit you.
Hey, this is her dog.
Did she come here
in search of that?
He has trapped her.
Oh God! It's a matured dog.
WiII it become a case?
Arjun, what's this nonsense?
Did you think of me?
Did you think of father?
- Why?
You don't taIk,

How can I face that girI if
this bitch becomes pregnant?
Oh My god, it'II come to my head.
- How's it possibIe?
Then wiII you take

Why? OnIy that's Iacking now.
It's better it doesn't become one.
OnIy girIs shouId be very carefuI,
Giving Iip to Iip kiss.
Did your sister taught you?
Is this the thing you

Have you enacted such a
big pIay after Iocking it?
You dirty peopIe.
- Kachada.
From the word ''Kachada'' I understood,
that you scoIded me bIack & bIue.
I'm not just Kachada

You know one thing.
My dog and your dog are in Iove.

Don't use that.

I'II definiteIy hand over

Hand over me to the poIice.
You remember one thing.
Not that I wished.
Arjun and JuIie,

They met, came cIoser

and spent a night together,
and had their honey moon.
StiII you haven't understood,
how immenseIy I Iove you.
AtIeast for the sake of
our dogs progeny.
we must unite.
Don't they need a father and a mother?
You brainIess, get out.

Work wouId've been much easier

This is your first operation

If that bomb goes off,

So find the bomb.
Hands up.

Okay, don't harm him

StiII, I've to teII you the truth.
Since I'm brave, interested in
crime investigation & inteIIigent.
because of that I couId trap
such a criminaI here.
I can go up aIone
and apprehend the Krimi.
Krimibacteria)?
Not Krimi but akrimicriminaI).
I can make him surrender.
Don't give faIse promise
and get beaten up.
Try to Iive without working.- Is it?
Since Iiving is...
Mr. Commissioner has come.
I'II hand over the rest
of the things to him.
Sir, criminaI is up there.
I couId onIy gather
this much of crowd.
Press peopIe are on
the way to here.
I'm not Ioafing around with a dog
at Government's expense.
PeopIe shouId know it.
Wait here...- Yes.
Sir, I'm not the waiter.
I'm with him and the dog.
Wait here, nobody shouId

Arjun, give way to him.
Even if he says so,
he might need my heIp.
Arjun, come on.
Wait here?
I'm not the waiter, rascaI.
KiII me or eIse...
Don't get afraid I'm going there.
It's me.- Didn't I ask you

Sir not here...he must be up.
You've come to Iook after

Sir...- What's aII this?
PoIicemen, press & pubIic

Sir...
If I catch you,

between me and Baba.
Sir, save me.- How can I?
ShaII I save you?- Yes.

CarefuI... Be carefuI
Hey, get me the gun.
Hey, get me the gun.
Hey...you onIy.
It's your probIem.
I'm not into this game.
Arjun, watch.
I think they'II break everything.
Oh God!
Yuck, crow dropping.
Sahadevan has attacked the criminaI.
Hi Arjun.
Sir, shall l ask you
something?- Go ahead.
Who feII down.
- The person from above.
A criminaI who pIaned the
bomb in the city hospitaI.
How did you attack the criminaI?
- With my strong wiII power.
Look at great Sahadevan.
Look at great Sahadevan.
Policeman run away.
What a catastrophe!
Sir no.
He's our onIy evidence.
Sir, don't kiII him.
When the pubIic and poIice
were watching,
you hit the PoIice Commissioner.
Not that I can't
put you behind bars.
Since he asked me not to,
so I didn't.
I know his spirits weII.
Just Ieave it.
Let him be outside.
Don't forgive him.
If you do, then he'II pIay marbIes
on the poIicemen's chest in future.
He'II turn naveI

Sir, your words.
PoIice department don't need neither
you nor your dog's heIp.
You can go.- Sir.
You can go.
Otherwise aIso I know it sir.
You accepted my demands
though you couIdn't accept,
and took me back into
the department.
I know weII it wasn't because
any affection on me.
For that reason I met those
criminaIs in the hospitaI.
Now you've found the criminaI.
Now you don't need my heIp
to prove the case.
So I got dismissed.
Thank you sir.
There's a point you don't know now aIso,
you might've not noticed it.
The aim of those criminaIs.
But I know, C.M. is their target.
Sir, he's diverting
the case.- No...
C.M. was in the hospitaI,
where they had pIanted the bomb.
Then the other 2 spots,
where C.M. was about to go.
I found the criminaI in a spot
where C.M. was to inaugurate.
So, there's no doubt,
you can fix it.
Our C.M's Iife is
in your hands. Bye.
Hey.
You're very inteIIigent.
Are you a private detective?
Is C.M. their target?
Yes man, Chief Minister is the target.
Can you rescue the Chief Minister?
You can't.
Now I'm undergoing the suffering
what Jesus had been through.
Why?- 2 poIicemen are on
either side of me.
We were Iiving happiIy
without doing any work.
Life's fiIament broke
in a go suddenIy.
What's your next step?
He must be thinking
about that D.I.G.
Hey, you don't worry about me.
Then, what're you going to do?
I can eke my IiveIihood
sending him to do odd jobs.
Am I your sIave?
Then, I'II go back to jaiI
if I've to suffer here.
Then don't say that
I waIked out siIentIy.
Anyway, his future is in
jaiI onIy.- Your's Saha.
I don't think about future.
But I stiII remember that
deviI's face in my mind.
That commissioner's.
Some mystery is hidden
behind his face.
Are we CID's to find that?
What did you say?
- Are we CID's?
CID. Good idea.
I've found a way to achieve my aim.
But it's IittIe cheap.
I was expecting,

Tea is okay, right?
No woman here,
why do you take unnecessary troubIe?
What troubIe!
Just one second.
Come on.- UncIe, you've

of my Iife. It's their bad time.
This is the key to my kingdom and

You've to soIve everything.

Oh God! There's a hoIe

I dug the hoIe.- Why?
If car doesn't start,
Sit Iike this, put your
Ieg into the hoIe.
Stand up and push the car.
We won't need anybody's
heIp to push the car.
I'm aIone is enough. Watch.
Even James Bond doesn't

Because this is with me.
Then I've set up different
techniques in this car.
You can appIy it onIy

You've to take him with you.
Then, as a return for this heIp,

Work in office is stopped.
Everything had happened

Varghi, wiII we Iose

Chances are Iess.
I feeI he's going bit too much

CID MooIam KuzhiyiI Sahadevan.
Name doesn't sound good.
Why don't we change your name?
Don't...MooIam KuzhiyiI

Then, why don't we keep it

Shit! Changing the name.
Doesn't it sound pIeasant?
Okay, if we take out

That'II be nice CID MooIam.

Didn't I teII you not to Iet

You've found him

That's why, I'm Ieaving you.
You disguise yourseIf to hide from

Job. I don't want saIary
aIso free...
What nonsense are you taIking?
What's wrong with you?
Sir, they had Iatest weapons.
StiII I tried to attack.
But it went in vain.
Look at my head.
When you're taking a
criminaI for inquiry,
CouIdn't you use more forces?
No more expIanations.
May I come in sir?- Yes.
Moossa...Moossa....
Moossa...Moossa...
Any personaI discussion?

SmiIe.
Okay? Thank you sir.
A criminaI who had escaped

CID Moossa caught him adventurousIy
and brought him back to poIice.
Is it okay sir?- Okay.
I tried hard and caught him
since I Iike you.
Because you and my grandma

Gowri grandma.
Not onIy that, my grandma aIso
didn't have a moustache Iike you.
But she Iooked very pretty.
- Sir, this is too much.
If you've any more cases,

Output wiII be high and

Okay, see you again sir.

CIear out.
I am Baba's man.
CIear out I say.
ShouIdn't we state a reason

He tried to kiII you
but I kiIIed him.
Sorry.
Do police have right to shoot
and kill a criminal?
Excuse me.
He tried to attack a
poIiceman in station.
PoIice had to shoot him down.
George is in the hospitaI...
5 sutures.
This traitor's death,
has made us Iose a big Iead
in proving the big case.
This is because of poIice negIigence,
nepotism and incapabiIity.
His raising voice before poIice
is aIso incapabiIity of poIice.
PoIice are aIso incapabIe of
catching Thorappan Kochunni.
Where did you Iearn this from?
- From the papers.
This is a prepIanned murder.
BIack hands which
are behind this pIot,
are of Commissioner.
EarIier aIso Commissioner
had tried to kiII him.
I've the evidences with me.
No...
It'II Iead to an argument
if you interrupt now.
He'II get the pubIic support.
He's disgracing us and do we've
to watch it siIentIy?
It's quite your inefficiency.
You've to answer for it.
So, it's better for you to just hear.
Now pubIic shouId decide.
Suspend the Commissioner.
We want justice.
Suspend the Commissioner.
Well planned murder.
Commissioner has pIayed
a major part in it. CID Moossa.
Next...
Was Commissioner,

CID Moossa.
CID Moossa is boasted everywhere.
YeIIow paper has been
pubIished onIy for him.
I've that! ShaII I read it?
Sir, we inquired thoroughIy about
his detective company.
No Iicense for the estabIishment
named ''CID Moossa''.
No Iicense! Yeah!
Come on.
Break everything.
Since we didn't have the Iicense,
Iook at the rashness of the poIice.
Go...

First Iearn to waIk in sIow motion.
Don't you watch
Rajinikanth's movies?
Who's this Moossa?
- Private detective.
Private detective.
BIoody rascaI.
Dog...scoundreI.
I don't need anybody's heIp.
You peopIe are not fit
to do anything.
I know what to do.
In T.V. and news papers,
are praising CID Moossa for his
daring act of rescuing C.M.
Many cases which are stiII unsoIved,
there's a stream of petitions saying
to hand over those cases to Moossa.

They aren't somebody.
This is my father.- HeIIo.
Sir personaIIy to us.
What do you Iike to
teII me personaIIy?
How did you know they had
pIanted a bomb in my car?
They might've understood
when it went off, right?
Who's behind this pIot?
Sir, the one who pIanned to
kiII you.- AII of us know it.
We are asking about the person.
The one who pIanted the bomb.
- Stop it.
Sir, we're CID's.
We reveaI aII our secrets
onIy at the cIimax.
Okay, can't your agency
heIp the poIice secretIy?
Sir, how can I heIp you?
You're the one who knows
many detaiIs of this case.
So, do you mean I've to catch
the cuIprit for the poIice?
No need sir.
Let not cIub together
poIice and CID.
Let them carry on with
their own investigations.
We'II investigate in our own
styIe for you.- That's enough.
Sir, but I've a demand.
- What's it?
I need a gun.
Why?
After I rescued your Iife,
I aIso receive many Iife threats.
That's why, pIease.
I can accept, if there's no
IegaI probIems, right?
Sir...
Excuse me...no sir...
ShouIdn't grant a gun to

If anything goes wrong,

Who wiII rescue my Iife?
Sir, pIease...a gun...
Okay, I'II give you the gun
but you shouIdn't use it.- No sir.
Then, is to simpIy carry it?
I didn't mean that.
OnIy poIice can take
the Iaw into their hands.
Then,
PubIic shouId not be affected
if it's shoot at sight.
You've to fire onIy
beIow the knee.
WiII you shoot atIeast today?
That's to keep this.
That shouIdn't be kept in
the nose but in the ears.
I know that.- Then why are...
Hey, my concentration is getting
diverted. Don't shout.
Can I shout if you shoot
at my chest by mistake?
WiII the criminaIs standstiII
on the waII for you to shoot them?
Fire.
You keep on firing without
having any responsibiIity.
I've 2 chiIdren of

Does my mother know this?
I'm taIking about you
and your sister.
Son, now you've got many cases.
You've achieved fame.
You've personaI reIationship

Oh God! See the man who has

There's such a character.
Haven't you heard that rabbit died
when he threw the jack fruit?
Jack fruit...rabbit...Sambu.
How's Moossa connected with them?
You're aIso soIving the

You don't have that taIent.
He's a brainIess feIIow.
Dumb headed! He's just acting.
Nit wit.
Shut up! Your North Indian.
What do you think of me?
You know one truth.
I'm great.
I meet many girIs.
I didn't have the feeIings
on them which I've on her.
You know why?
Because Iove at first sight.
That's why, I repeat one thing

Even if it's IittIe Iate,
I'II go onIy with you.
Because I Iove you.
Give back the sweets.

I've bought them from my money.
Oh My hat.- Take it.

She's teIIing to her fiancee
that I am just Shikari Sambu.
I've to prove her that I am not.
Since he knows the truth,
how're you going to prove it?
Don't search for the stones.
I'II take back my words.
By finding the cuIprits behind
the attempt on C.M's Iife.
I've to prove that
I'm CID Moossa to her.
It's a chaIIenge.
From where shouId
we open it?- What?
Sorry from where shouId
we begin it?
We've to suspect the Commissioner
first with avaiIabIe evidences.
But somebody is behind him.
We've to find them.
- I got it.
I got a cIue of the Ieader.- Who?
OnIy on June 2nd, 2003, they had
pIanted a bomb in the city hospitaI.
I saw him there.
It's him onIy.
I'm damn sure.- He's mad.
He's pretending to be.
Then why shouId he come
everywhere? Is he mad?
We're mad to negIect the one
who's pretending to be mad.
Oh God! I may go mad.
Vikrama brother, you're great.
What about me?
- You're waste.
Say Iike that.
We've to foIIow his movements cIoseIy
without wasting a minute.
Come on, Iet's foIIow him.
The siIent tiger, which comes
from the forest to hunt.
Come this way.
Who shoot down aII the probIems
by his arrows,
Give a tusk of the Iord to him.
He knows the story of genie.
- Yes.
He knows to whirI around the heII.
He knows to pIay tricks.
- He knows.
Let's wear the muIticoIoured siIk.
Even if you become the executor,
you can't see the sky.
You can't see your grandma
if you go to the market.
This's the game of fire...
the new game of puIIing tiger's taiI.
On the way, a snake raised
it's hood and hissed.
Let's frighten it
with our tricks.
When the Iocusts swarm,
When the ghosts attack,
Sword, sticks, sickIes
won't work out.
It's the bad time when even
a tiger turns into rat.
AII his unexpected approaches
turn to be an advantage.
VioIence...heavy rains & thunder...
JackaI in the cage...
RepIying to a fooI...
hurry-burry aII over...
Many troubIes.
What's the remedy for it?
My Iimbs and body became tired
of facing many difficuIties.
Break away from your surroundings...
A buiIding with 10 storeys...
PuII down the sticks...
Throw away your beIongings...
O the immortaI wind which
doesn't know the path...
The Parrot which takes the revenge
by digging the grave...
A fIute for the nest...
Beads for the Cuckoo...
A noose to the God of death...
a net to the wind...
An umbreIIa to the sea...
a bIast to the mountain...
Wow! PeopIe have come
from my pIace. Come...
Run...run...Vandi kaIa
buII) has come.
BuII! They're humans.
God of death has come
...run...run...
Are aII mad fine?
Hey get in.

What am I to do now?
Down.
Oh my god!
Sorry.
He's very arrogant.
Who's he to shoot down a person?
Is he a poIice officer?
I warned you earIier not to
grant him a pistoI.
Who's he to fire?
Is he shooter Panicker?
Sir, I didn't shoot him wantonIy.
I aimed at his Ieg desist
him from escaping.
By that time he Iied.
- No more expIanations.
I've supported you severaI times.
Now, you're a murderer.
Sir...sir...
Oh my god, what am I...
I think we're wasting our time.
Why don't you aIIow me to arrest
and take him to the court?
You don't know
about KeraIa poIice.
Brother-in-Iaw.
- Who's your brother-in-Iaw?
Stop it. This isn't the pIace for
you to soIve your famiIy probIems.
Sir, fIask.
Fax.
FIash.
Oh my god!
DeIhi poIice reward for that kiIIed

Congrats Sahadevan.
Thank you sir.

Who's that?
Can you stop for a minute?
WiII you frighten to make me stop?
You've come to visit
Shikari Sambu unexpectedIy.
I've read in the papers that
you've kiIIed a person.
Events happening in CID Moossa's
crime investigating Iife,
are just a measure of arts.
This is just a trifIe murder.
You're going to see big murders.
Do you know the truth?
Don't teII anybody.
I'm great.
That dead man was staying in
my house as a paying guest.
Oh God!
2 of them who was with
him are missing.
I've Iodged the compIaint
to the Commissioner.
Commissioner? What fooIishness
have you done?- What's it?
Come.
Leave him, he's innocent.
Hey Put him into the van. Fast.
Grandpa.
You've come at the right time.
We didn't know that
they were criminaIs.
Don't harm him.
I'II not harm him.
Hey, Ieave that oId man.
You put her into the van.
Sir, what nonsense is this?
She's innocent.
Who are you?
Why are you so soft towards her?
Love?

Non-baiIabIe offence.

You Iook very beautifuI.
ShaII I see your beauty?
Who's that?
I Iove you.
You Iove me?
You Iove me?
Let the meIodious breeze sway.
Let the rain drops pour.
Let the thunder and Iightning strike.
When winter faIIs, fIies wiII
cover the entire town.
You're the moon seen cIearIy
in the dreams of mirror.
Aren't you the star I kiss?
O ApriI IiIy fIower.
ShaII I turn into downy-bed on you?
You're the chiIIness of cIoud,
I'II cover you with my sari.
O dear! O beIoved!
A paIace in the moon
under the mist.
Don't Iook at me!
Don't utter a word!
I'm the Iime stone, I'II break
into pieces if you touch me.
When I see you, bIue fIames
go up in my eyes.
When I Iie on your shouIder,
I heard the ticking tune
in my breathe.
O PearI! Don't cover yourseIf.
ShaII I add hues to
your fIowery Iips?
Oh My beIoved! Aren't you my kannan?
Isn't it the humming song
which somebody sings at night?
Sir, it seems he has Iink
with a major terror gang.
To cheat poIice as weII as
to gain the pubIic support.
He runs the detective agency,
says the FIR.
Sir, he's very dangerous criminaI.
You've to give us
shoot at sight order.
An order to kiII a suspect man.
Don't utiIise this chance to
take revenge on him.- Revenge.
Sir, since you peopIe are
affectionate on him.
He has become more stiff necked.
He beat me in the station
and kidnapped that girI.
As a rebeI, if I can't do anything.
Why am I poIice then?
Send away.
Mr. Gowri, don't get emotionaI.
I'm very sorry.
But I'm emotionaI.
I've worn this cap
for 15 yrs.
I'm sincere to this cap.
DIG, what's your opinion?
Sir, I don't beIieve he has any
Iink with the terrorist gang.
But the way he reacted

It's a crime, right?
You've agreed haven't you?
Sir, we've to arrest him.
PIease issue the order.
Yes, you carry on.

I know that.
I was eager to meet you.
Why?
I saw him. God of death.
KaIik Muhammad aIias Baba.
Terrorist Ieader.
I didn't commit any mistake.
When I ordered to
finish the terrorists,
I never expected that their
famiIies wouId aIso suffer.
Then their terrorism wasn't
towards the government.
But with me.
I had to pay a heavy price for it.
To get Baba reIeased from the jaiI,
his men had kidnapped
my younger daughter.
When they threatened to kiII her,
I didn't mind it.
I Ioved my country more
than my daughter.
They kiIIed my dearest daughter.
I don't mind Iosing my Iife
for this country.
But I've to get my eIder
daughter married.
I've to Iive untiI then.
Have you kiIIed him?- No.
That rascaI Moossa is there.

Stop it. You're under arrest.

AtIeast one feet before the running dog.
I just said a proverb.
Hey Dog.- Hey.
Not you.
Vikram brother, throw that

WiII your father pay

''LET'S GIVE HIM SOME WORK''.
Greetings Chief Minister.

Sitting here wiII
