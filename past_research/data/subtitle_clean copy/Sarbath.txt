-You may leave.
-Okay, sir.
I think they belong to Vagaiyara's clan.
Yes! They aren't getting caught.
-Where are they?
-They are at the festival.
Brother, nobody was home.
All of them are at the festival.
Abduct the entire family.
Hey! Drive fast.
-Who are you all?
-What do you want?
What did you do?
Without even knowing the problem,
they have decided that
I am responsible for it.
That's not their fault.
It's because that's how
I have been since childhood.
Your brother studies in
the same school as well.
But he is a sober one.
Why are you like this?
You will write "Henceforth,
I won't fight with anyone"
in your notebook 1000 times
and come to school tomorrow.
Understood? You may leave now.
-Does it hurt?
-Not at all.
Can't you hit back the
person who hits you?
That's wrong.
Will you keep quiet if someone hits you?
That's what always happens.
My brother will land in a problem
but I end up getting blamed for it.
My father is a follower of Periyar.
My parents fell in love and
got married against their family's wishes.
So, it's just the four
of us in the family.
We support each other.
Your brother is quite independent.
Learn something from him.
-Are you going to school regularly?
-Yes.
-Are you completing your homework on time?
-Yes.
-I will check with your teacher.
-Sure.
Wear your pants, apply
some powder and leave.
My brother and I mean
the world to our mom.
Give this to your brother.
Why don't you give it yourself?
We are like every other sibling.
We also have minor problems and fights.
But our mother didn't
consider it to be a minor one.
-Are you leaving for school?
-Yes.
Go safely.
Go.
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.
What happened?
Both of them are always fighting.
We thought that both
would support each other.
They are still young.
They don't understand certain things.
They'll understand with time.
Why are you worried?
Now we are grown-ups.
He passed in group two exam
and got a job in the government quota.
I'm working in an IT company.
But our mother still keeps nagging us.
That's only because she
wants to get us married.
My parents have been looking for an
alliance for my brother for three years.
He doesn't want to get married.
We have got an alliance
from Chinnalapatti.
They belong to a decent family
and the girl looks good as well.
She is a graduate.
They have asked us to come on Wednesday.
Shall we go and meet the family?
What do you think of yourself?
When will you get married?
Guys of your age have settled in life.
We need to get your younger
brother married as well.
Nowadays, many in town
elope and get married.
-I have to keep nagging you all the time.
-Mom!
My brother agreed for the marriage
to get rid of mom's nagging
and his friends' advice.
-That will get us some support--
-Let's go on Wednesday.
What did you say?
We can go.
Are you angry with me?
No. We may go.
Hi, Mom.
We have finalized an alliance for Anbu.
He likes the girl.
That's awesome, Mom.
They want the wedding
to be done this month itself.
They are coming to our house
on the 14th of this month.
Make sure you are here.
He will not like my presence.
Don't act smart.
How can you not be here
on such an important day?
Okay, I will come for your sake.
You'll go back only
after the wedding is done.
Make sure you apply for
your leaves accordingly.
Okay.
Where is this guy?
I expected him to be
here with a bandwagon.
Why are you staring at me?
Do you consider girls cheap?
-Hey!
-Keep quiet.
You teased her on the
bus last Saturday, right?
Listen to me.
-Shut up.
-Listen to me.
I will not spare you if
you repeat your mistake!
Hey! He is not the one.
It's the other fellow!
What are you saying?
Let's go.
-What are you doing? Leave him.
-Bloody rascal!
Will you do it again?
Aruna, let's go.
Leave me! Such people--
-You shouldn't spare him.
-Everyone is watching us. Leave him.
Start the vehicle.
-Let's go.
-Oh, God!
Hey, dude!
You look nice.
You should ask me how I am.
Well, that's my style of greeting.
Where is bro?
We have a festival tomorrow, right?
-He's getting ready for it.
-Okay, let's go.
The most valorous person has arrived
He's riding on a horse
He is endowed with all prosperity
He brings fame for us
We sing his praises
We shower him with love and affection
We live as brothers and relatives
We demand this without fear
This town should
Have everything in abundance
Our country should also prosper
We should become famous
We should have mental strength
We should follow the righteous path
We should be showered with good things
We sing his praises
We shower him with love and affection
We live as brothers and relatives
We demand this without fear
The wild young oxen will
Raise its mustache
And stare at you deeply
All suppressed desires will come out
And chase the young man
The young girls will give
Suggestions to you
Through their eyes
To show you the way
The children will ask
For sweets as a bribe
You should give us confidence
You should eradicate poverty
You should turn the sand into gold
You should protect people
This town should only speak truth
All should live together here
Everything should be created by you
You should say good words
And bless this town
This town should have everything
In abundance
Our country should prosper
We should become famous
We should have mental strength
We should follow righteous path
We should be showered
With all the good things
We sing his praises
We shower him with love and affection
We live as brothers and relatives
We demand this without fear
She was a beautiful girl.
Get down.
Don't you have beautiful girls in Chennai?
It's not important where the girl is from.
It's important whether she's brave or not.
How do you know that she is brave?
She was beating a guy in front of--
What if she was drunk?
Who got beaten up by her?
Why do I feel that you
got beaten up by her?
Is it you?
Yes, you are the one.
I will listen to the
entire story tomorrow.
Come and have lunch at home.
Tigers never get down from the bike
even if they are hungry.
I didn't go along with your
family to the alliance's house.
Your mom is angry with me.
People are waiting for me at the temple.
-I will convince her tomorrow.
-Come with me.
-You monkey!
-He got scared.
-Please come.
-Hi, Dad.
What time are they coming tomorrow?
Why do you all look tense?
What happened?
Please sit.
Did he fall off the vehicle?
He doesn't even know how to cycle.
Why does he have to take such risks?
Why are you blabbering
without knowing the situation?
What happened?
Do you want to know about it?
-He has lost his mind again.
-Mom!
Keep quiet.
Mom, just tell me what happened.
Your brother rejected the proposal.
How did he get hurt?
-The girl's brother attacked your brother.
-Mom!
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
Hereafter, I will not even open my mouth!
-Do as you like.
-Just move aside!
Why are you behaving in this manner?
He is the one.
Are you Senthil?
Who are you?
Wait right here! I will bring my friends.
Wait right here!
They are coming to hit us.
-I will kill you.
-Hey! Who are you?
I am Anbu's brother.
How dare you beat my brother!
I am speaking to you.
Why are you looking at that side?
Don't you dare touch him again!
How long will you keep hanging on
the parachute? Jump!
-Come before the van.
-Where?
-Do you see someone behind the van?
-Where is he?
Go back. Try to follow him.
-I will go after him.
-Follow him.
Wait, I am coming.
-I am down here. Follow me.
-Okay.
-Do you see a bike there?
-Yes.
Get that bike.
Anbu, we have got
another proposal for you.
Don't you have any other work?
Why do you keep talking
about the same thing?
Please leave me alone.
You will remain single if you
keep saying such dialogues.
-Hey!
-Yes.
The girl's family likes you.
Stop looking for alliances!
I don't want to get married!
It is difficult to find a girl for you.
Why are you acting smart?
Bro!
Why did you beat the girl's brother?
You better answer her question first.
You've been here for two days.
He's already landed himself in trouble.
He fought with Pandi's relative
and the girl's brother.
Do you want me to not do anything?
You need not do anything for me.
I can handle my life.
You mind your business.
Hey! Arivu!
Feed him well.
Let him fight with everyone!
Let him get beaten by all.
Why don't you question them?
Look at their behavior.
Are they small kids?
They will change with time.
When they were young,
you said that they will
change when they grow up.
Now you are asking
whether they are small kids.
I don't know when
everything will be fine.
Don't you know about Anbu?
He might have said it in anger.
To heck with him!
-That's too much!
-After all, he is your friend.
-You will support him.
-You are my friend as well!
Hey! Cocktail and mutton fry are ready.
Shall we go?
Stop right here!
I am talking to you.
Take your hand off me.
Do you think you are great?
I have a lot of piled up work.
Do you know my value for an hour?
Do you know his value for one hour?
He just removes mud with JCB, right?
-Buddy--
-Did I ask you to speak?
Do you realize who you
are leaving behind?
I am the one who drove you to school
on cycle every day.
A friend who was a messenger
for your childhood love.
A teacher who taught
you how to smoke and drink.
That's how the sentiment works.
I didn't feel bad.
You don't need to apologize to me.
Come with me.
-Bro!
-Tell me.
She is the one.
So, didn't he stop for us?
Okay, tell me.
-That day--
-She slapped you.
-Oh, no! Why is he here?
-Hey!
Don't laugh at such things.
Hello.
-Wait. I will be back.
-Hey!
Hey!
Do I look like a ghost?
You slapped me the other day by mistake.
Why are you running away from me?
Did I make any mistakes?
Did you intentionally slap me?
You can apologize for it.
Or, will you have coffee with me?
Apologize to me or have a coffee with me.
You have pleaded enough, brother.
So, I have decided to stay back
only for you!
-Happy?
-No, buddy!
-Hey!
-You can leave.
-Buddy!
-You can leave.
You are my brother,
my friend, and my guru.
In short, you are my Godfather.
I don't want your concern.
He doesn't give a damn about us
but the strangers.
You can go.
-Push him and not me!
-Please go!
He said that he liked her.
-Oh, God!
-Why did he reject that girl?
That girl is in love with someone else.
-But--
-Shut your mouth!
It is a sin to make the bottle wait.
Drink quickly.
He won't allow us to drink
-without telling him the truth.
-Tell him.
Everything was going well.
One fine day…
Hello.
Is it Mr. Anbu?
Yes, tell me.
Aruna and I have been in love
for the past two years.
We landed in trouble when our
family came to know about our love.
That's why they arranged
your marriage in a haste.
What are you saying?
Yes, sir.
Our family didn't accept our love.
It would be great if
you reject the proposal.
Please understand.
If you tell me now--
Why can't you ask her
to reject the proposal?
Poor Aruna!
If you reject the proposal, then we
will do something to set things right.
Please hang up.
What is going on?
We have booked the banquet
and informed our relatives as well.
How can you reject the proposal now?
This is not right.
Your girl is not suitable for our family.
Let it be.
The marriage hasn't taken place.
What are you saying?
We are not as cheap as you.
I told my wife that we should find
an alliance that matches our status.
But she was more
concerned about horoscopes.
It's not always about the
horoscopes but the people as well.
It is better to not have a
relationship with people like you.
I curse you that you will
never get married.
Mind your words!
-Hey!
-Who are you talking about?
Keep quiet.
Why don't you look after your daughter
instead of yelling at us?
We rejected this proposal
because of your daughter.
She is planning to
elope with her lover.
No one will marry your daughter.
She will bring a bad
reputation to your family.
Did he say that?
-Hey!
-Leave him!
Leave him!
-I will kill him!
-Leave him!
-Pull him back.
-Hey!
-Hey! Leave him.
-Leave me!
Why are you fighting with us?
Who called my brother?
Shall I tell you after drinking this?
You can drink after telling me.
I will speak nonsense.
-Drink now.
-Thank you!
Who is that boy?
Which boy?
The one who called Anbu.
He didn't get any calls.
How can you call off a marriage
without knowing who called?
Do you have his number?
You should ask your brother.
Get it from him and call him.
Did you drink?
Call him.
I think something is mixed in the toddy.
It is very strong.
-Dude!
-Yes.
The number is switched off.
How will you reach him now?
Shall I help you get down?
Why did you ask us to come here?
-Someone called Anbu, right?
-Yes.
-He is in this village.
-So?
Something is wrong.
We will inquire about him.
How did you find him?
It is not difficult to trace a person's
address with his phone number.
The one in this photograph,
his name is Aalavanthan.
-Are you watching a porn movie?
-Yes.
We are seeing your movie.
Please don't block my way.
-You may leave.
-Okay.
Buddy!
He is the one in the photo.
Give me a boost.
Which college are you going to today?
Don't talk nonsense.
Make my drink.
Why is he staring at the unused notebook?
-Brother, cancel the boost.
-Here he goes.
I didn't even make one for you.
Hey!
Excuse me! Wait a minute.
-Wait a minute.
-Buddy, follow me on the bike.
Hey, buddy!
Why do you keep following everyone?
He is going alone, buddy.
-Walk aside.
-What is it?
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
Am I a beauty queen?
I love Aruna.
That is why I did that.
Does she love you?
What a stupid question!
Leave me. The blood is still flowing.
Why would I stop the
marriage if she loved me?
My brother's wedding got called off
because of you.
You will tell the truth
to the girl's family.
-If not, I will--
-I will come!
Not because you are threatening me.
I'll come with you as I
respect your intelligence.
Hey!
I don't have change.
You can come tomorrow.
I asked for the notebook.
Why do you have this notebook with you?
Didn't you think I was a college student?
No.
You need to drop me from
the point you picked me up.
Follow me.
Stupid fellow.
Why is he going on his own now?
Is this the house?
Yes.
Are you doubting me?
Is she the one?
Yes, she is the one.
She is the one chosen for Anbu.
Let's go back.
Don't panic.
I am coming with you.
I might abuse you.
She gets angry easily
but that's all right.
I know that.
-Have you also experienced her anger?
-Hey!
Lucky boy.
I got hit by her thrice.
What happened?
Why is your behavior
a bit strange today?
Are you going to meet Obama?
Obama's period is over.
Now it is Donald Trump's time.
Seeing pictures in the
newspaper is not enough.
-One should know to read.
-Hey!
I know it well.
Donald--
Come on. Say it.
Donald Trump. Buddy!
Donald… Trump.
-Tell me.
-Hey!
Why are you troubling me?
Does that girl live here?
How did you come to know?
Finding something out is
not a difficult task for me.
Your smile says everything.
Enough of smiling.
I will give you the breaking news.
Your brother…
The girl who was going to
marry your brother, lives here.
Don't go in front of them.
They will crush you.
-Buddy!
-Tell me.
Shall I give you some breaking news?
Not just the place
but it is the same girl.
-Uncle! How are you?
-I am fine. How are you?
Did you finally get the time to come home?
You guys never bother to inform me
about anything.
I heard that the marriage got called off.
What happened?
Won't you share the problem with me?
Why should we share it?
We don't want to blow
it out of proportion.
Uncle, I will drop Aruna and be back.
Wait a minute.
Get inside the car.
Tell me about that person.
Uncle, please be patient.
How can someone beat you?
We can deal with that matter later.
I can't tolerate the fact that
he spoke ill about Aruna.
I still wish to kill him and his family!
I don't want Aruna's name to be tarnished.
We will handle this after
Aruna's wedding is over.
I will inform you.
You can call me anytime.
Hey, Senthil!
The Star Cricket channel is deactivated.
Activate it while coming back.
-Is there a cricket match today?
-Hey!
Today is the finals.
Today is England and
Australia's final match.
I will wait for you. Leave!
He is watching a test match.
He has been torturing me
with the matches for three years.
-Let's go.
-He is acting too smart.
He does not even respect me.
What wrong thing did I do?
I will not stay mum for long.
I know how I need to behave with everyone.
I don't want others' advice.
Did you see that?
-Take this.
-Hey!
-Isn't this too much?
-No!
She was selected for your brother.
But the marriage got called off.
This is wrong.
This won't work out.
-Why?
-Are you mad?
Both the families are not on good terms.
You also attacked her brother.
How can I let her go?
I think she is perfect for me.
We will think of other problems later.
It is not enough for you to like her.
-She should also reciprocate.
-This is the right point.
What should we do for that?
I should talk to her and understand her.
That's what I am going to try now.
And if she still doesn't
like me, then I will drop the plan.
I don't think that will happen.
She will leave you as soon as
she comes to know who you are.
Thanks, dude!
Let us not disclose our identity.
I'll apologize to her
if she starts liking me.
I think I am giving him ideas.
You are like a charcoal quill
You look like a peacock when you smile
I lost myself but
She evades me and disappears
Bright as a sun
She is a typhoon while angry
I become red when I see her
She continuously disturbs me
I got her for me
It is destined
I enjoy losing my sleep
It is a gift from her
She anchored herself
She raises in the middle of my heart
She rules like a queen there
You terrify me with your sharp sight
Your look is like a spear
You make me intoxicated in front of you
You give me love in pieces
You are the medicine for my lovesickness
I go majestically like an ox
But you vanquish me with your eyes
The unexpressed love sleeps inside
I earn value less money
I wake up listening
To your words every day
I construct a bridge between us
But you demolished that
I can't differentiate
Between morning and evening
I don't get sleep at all
You spoiled my dream
You hide behind a screen
I am spiritless like night
You illuminate me like a light
You are like a needle in the clock
You fasten a saddle and lead me
You terrify me with your sharp sight
Your look is like a spear
You make me intoxicated in front of you
You give me love in pieces
You are the medicine for my lovesickness
You are the one
Isn't he the one you beat at the bus stop?
He has been following me
for the past one week.
What did you do?
What will I do?
Is he following you
without you reacting to him?
You are after her for a week.
There is no response from the other side.
Her friend doesn't care about you as well.
Enough of it!
Tell me.
Okay, please note it down.
Her favorite colors are black and blue.
If you don't speak properly
then he will beat you once again.
She loves idli and biryani.
That's great.
She is crazy over
Yuvan Shankar Raja's music.
She likes the RX 100 bike.
She does not like your bike's color.
Shall we sell the vehicle and booze?
-Okay!
-I will kill you!
-Sorry.
-Go on.
She likes drawing and painting.
Okay.
She draws a lot.
But I don't know
whether it is good or bad.
Are you still following her?
She was wearing a white dress yesterday.
You were wearing a blue dress.
-Wow!
-Mr. Aalavanthan, stop following her.
-She is my lover.
-Okay.
How did you accept it so soon?
We must do what our lover likes.
That is true love.
I don't understand at all.
Nobody understands me.
She likes you.
She keeps observing you.
Lucky boy.
Henceforth, I won't trouble you. Bye.
Hey, please don't mistake me.
Is this your full-time job?
Don't you have any other work to do?
Oh, no.
We can't bear it if we don't have work.
How can you be happy?
Who else will spend my father's wealth?
What is your father doing?
He is the MLA of this constituency.
-What?
-MLA.
Is he an MLA?
We have been friends, right?
Please don't mind my words.
We will vote for your father.
The ones who lack self confidence
-tend to use their father's name.
-Okay.
-I will leave.
-I have a request.
It will take years for you to
spend your father's wealth.
Shall we help you out?
I will ask my father and get back to you.
-Okay.
-Bye!
-Bye!
-Bye.
You changed the color of your bike
and the ringtone of your cell phone.
But, who is that on your t-shirt?
Where are we going?
-Just come with me!
-Okay!
Who is that on your t-shirt?
I'm asking you.
Is that your relative?
There's no point looking over there.
She will not come.
-How do you know that?
-I just know it.
Why didn't you inform
me about that earlier?
-I will--
-Leave me.
You get angry when I don't
answer your unasked questions.
Did you answer my questions?
Tell me!
Bro, you won't understand all this.
Then, why don't you explain it to me?
His name is Vanco.
He is a famous drawing artist.
He draws and paints well.
She likes drawing.
Are you trying to impress her with this?
Right?
What wouldn't I understand?
Do you think you are superior
just because you are from Chennai?
How can you decide that we're fools?
Do you know the length of the JCB boom?
Do you know the number of buckets in that?
Do you know that?
Tell me!
Don't underestimate
the power of an ordinary man.
Sorry, dude!
Why did she not come today?
There's a festival going
on in their village today.
Dude.
What?
Do you want to go there?
Right? I know it well.
Take the vehicle home.
-Dude!
-What is it?
Do you want me to come like this?
You always want to look the best.
Let's go back home.
Let me change my dress.
I need to find someone.
Is this my mother-in-law's village?
If you get caught, then
you will be sent to prison.
Brother.
Brother, I was asked to give this to you.
-Really? Who said that?
-Hey!
Foolish boy.
They are near the stage.
Go and give it to them.
Why did he give that to me?
That belongs to the village dancers.
I asked the boy to give it to
them but instead, he gave it to you.
Remove the glasses.
You can laugh your heart out.
I know that you are laughing.
Your mouth will get disfigured.
Go there!
A kid is mocking me!
Where will she be?
-Which one is better?
-I like both of them.
Dude! Aruna!
This hand…
What happened?
Shall I approach the girl coming with her?
She is like your daughter. Come with me.
-What do you say?
-Oh, no!
Dude!
Look over there.
Senthil is standing there.
Dude, he is here.
-Who is it?
-Arivu.
I think they are waiting to attack us.
Not us, but you!
Won't you take a beating for your friend?
Why should I take beatings for your love?
-What should we do now?
-Let's catch them!
-They are coming. Shall we escape?
-Let's escape!
Did he already escape?
I came here to find a girl
but now I am the one stuck.
They are coming to attack us. Save me.
Dude, start the vehicle.
The police will catch
us if we go in triples.
Be careful, dude.
My shirt will get ruined.
Come on!
If you have the guts, then
meet us at our village festival.
Hi!
How come you are here?
Hello! I should ask you this question.
This is our place.
Why are you here?
I came here to get slapped.
Wait for some time.
You will get slapped.
-Sister.
-I am coming.
Everything is beautiful.
Why have you thrown them like this?
I am serious about it.
Hi!
Hi!
You asked for something, right?
You may ask her for it.
Where are you from?
What's your name?
Ariv--
Venkat.
I am from Pillaiyar Natham.
I have not seen you before.
I am working in an IT company in Chennai.
I am here for holidays.
I rarely come here.
I think you have been roaming
here for many days.
I need to leave soon.
I had to stay back and work from home
due to an unfinished business.
I'll leave once my job is done.
-What if your work is not done?
-Hey!
It is about my life.
How can you say that?
You better give a positive reply.
-Dude!
-Hello!
People never allow me to
watch a Hollywood movie.
I was right! Look at his stupid face!
-Silent.
-It is very urgent.
-I have work to do.
-Please give it to me.
I can't come right now.
-Hello.
-Hey, Aruna.
-Tell me.
-Where are you?
I am at the library.
I am asking because
my vehicle got punctured.
I can't come.
Why don't you come and pick it?
Who was that?
Why?
I just want to know.
That was my brother.
He wanted my vehicle.
Bro--
Okay.
I will see you later.
Dude!
Oh, my God!
I called you 32 times.
Won't you spare a person?
I was charging the phone in silent mode.
My phone fell and broke just
because you were constantly calling.
Who asked you to put it in silent mode?
I had chosen Yuvan Shankar Raja's
music for the ringtone.
Had you answered my call,
I would have got a chance to impress her.
If you want to impress her,
then play Yuvan Shankar Raja's
song in front of her house.
-We will take care--
-Shut your mouth!
-Buy me a new mobile phone.
-Hey!
Do you want a new phone in
replacement of this cheap one?
I want a new one.
I will not buy you one.
I would rather buy you juice.
Will you come with me?
How did you get convinced for juice?
You are anyway not going
to buy me a new phone.
I would rather have juice with you.
Leave that.
What about that girl?
What did she say?
Why are you asking me that?
-She stares, smiles--
-She stands up, sits down, sleeps.
Don't try to mock poetry.
Come to the point.
She didn't ask about the t-shirt.
-I changed the color of the bike.
-Yes.
She didn't even notice that.
I thought you will give me a call
and I would impress her with my ringtone.
You ruined everything.
Are you working in an IT company?
Or are you running an eatery stall
outside the company?
Why are you staring at me?
God knows why he changed the
color of the bike and wore that t-shirt.
Can you hear the ringtone only when
someone calls?
Wouldn't the alarm buzz you
with the same song?
You need to be updated.
Educated fellows!
My uncle is coming here.
-How are you, Arivu?
-I am fine, Uncle.
Are you not going to Chennai?
Why are you still here?
I need to go but--
-Greetings, Uncle.
-I couldn't meet you.
Try to leave soon.
You better don't hang around with him.
He is saying as if Sundar Pichai
used to roam with him.
Take these flyers and distribute
them all over Dindigul.
You are jobless.
Here he goes!
Give me a cigarette.
Pay for the cigarette.
Why don't you rather jump in the well?
He is not even able
to pay for a cigarette.
On top of that, he is advising me.
HANDICRAFTS AND ARTS
EXHIBITION IN DINDIGUL
Dude! What is this?
Handicrafts and arts exhibition.
That's how he cheats people every year.
I feel bad that you don't
have a mobile phone.
Shall we purchase a new one for you?
DINDIGUL

PALM LEAF CRAFT PRODUCTS
ARUNA PAINTING EXHIBITION
Who has done all this?
Look over there.
Dude, did you sell anything or not?
No one even bothered to take a look at it.
Someone will come now.
The one in the green shirt is our man.
-Sell him two paintings--
-I will call you later.
Welcome, sir.
Thank you.
This happened because of you.
Why are you being so formal?
You got rewarded for your talent.
We can't hide things for long.
Everyone will come to know about it.
I referred to the paintings.
You can talk to me about anything.
I won't feel bad about it.
Okay. Bye
We will place them back.
Please go safely.
Don't kill me slowly
Don't laugh within yourself
Eyes never lie
Don't keep things within you
Your handmade designs
Becomes the words of love
The rhythm of my feet
Is in search of you
You mesmerized me in no time
Now I am imprisoned
Your eyes captivate me
I get dissolved in rain
You pulled me into the river
Don't torture me with your loving words
Small messages on the screen
Turn into poetry
Your innocent smile induced me
Like the finger on the digital screen
My eyes devour your beauty
My heart searches for so many things
How long will you be
Without talking to me
Express your love for once
I never fall for anyone
But now, I have fallen for you
Enchantment is the limit
The sound of thunder
Small desires
Power failure can't stop
The language of your eyes
Pours on me like music
We will
Walk in the rain
We will be with each other
And prove our love
You mesmerized me in no time
Now, I am imprisoned
Your eyes captivate me
I get dissolved in rain
You pulled me into the river
Don't torture me with loving words
Dad is looking out for an alliance.
Why are you telling me now?
He is a very good person.
I am sure you will like him as well.
Or else, leave it.
You can talk to dad only if you like him.
Will you leave him if I don't like him?
Let's meet him tomorrow.
When do you plan to get married?
Why are you teasing me unnecessarily?
I am genuinely asking you but…
Even if it wasn't genuine, I will--
-Hi.
-Hello!
Tell me.
When are you returning to Chennai?
No idea. Why?
You were going to go back
once your job was done, right?
Is that finished?
I think so.
I'll leave once I am sure about it.
Let me know once it gets confirmed.
Hello! Wait a minute.
-How will he know the value of love?
-Hey!
I will deal with you tonight.
-Hello!
-Tell me.
What is your opinion?
Will it get confirmed?
I will tell you in person.
-I'm free. Should I come now?
-No.
Come to Kumaran Park at 10:00 a.m.
Okay.
-Dude.
-I know it.
She has accepted my love.
I will tell her the truth
and apologize to her.
DINDIGUL MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
RENOVATED KUMARAN PARK
Brother, Venkat…
Is he the one?
He is the brother of the guy who spread
rumors and got your marriage called off.
They tarnished our name
in front of our relatives.
Aruna, please.
I came here to tell you the truth.
-But before that--
-Hey!
We have already suffered
a lot because of you.
Are you here to trouble us more?
I want to curb this issue.
Don't ruin everything.
Listen to me, brother-in-Law
I am not your brother-in-law!
What did he do?
What is the problem?
Did he misbehave with you?
The police station is nearby.
Nothing like that.
It's our problem.
Let it be. I will deal with him.
Let's go, Aruna!
Aruna, please listen to me.
Aruna, listen to me!
Please!
Sorry, Aruna.
Okay.
I apologized to you.
I accepted your apology.
You may go.
What did I do?
I liked you even before knowing
anything more about you.
I liked you.
I wanted to get in touch with you.
Had you known about me,
you would have avoided me.
That is why I did not
disclose my identity.
That's the only thing I hid from you.
Why are you reacting so much
to a small issue?
Is this a small issue?
Do you know how my father was humiliated
when the marriage was called off?
Your family spread rumors about me
and stopped the wedding.
My family members
did not cross check with me.
Why?
My father didn't even let me know
about the incident.
My brother felt bad because
you spoke ill about me
and not because you beat him.
What will I tell them now?
Okay.
We will discuss that later.
Do you like me or not?
You are still not thinking
from my perspective.
You are just trying to justify yourself.
Aruna… tell me if you like me or not.
I did like you…
but not anymore.
Don't disturb me hereafter.
Go.
Go.
I feel ashamed.
-Tell me, Venu.
-When are you coming?
I need to work from home for
some more time.
It is not possible.
Come immediately.
I have offers from three companies, Venu.
-I will resign.
-For how long do I extend your leave?
Ask him.
Come and have food.
Mom, ask him.
Aren't you returning to Chennai?
Have the guts to tell me that
you don't like my presence!
Don't keep complaining.
What happened?
-Why is he still here?
-Hey!
Did you end up in trouble
and lose your job again?
I can take care of my life.
It would be better if everyone
minds their own business.
-Don't try to overpower--
-Hey!
What will you do?
Mom!
-Mom!
-Lift her.
How is she now?
There's nothing to worry about.
She fainted due to shock.
Her blood pressure is slightly high.
You can take her home once she is fine.
-Don't worry.
-Okay, doctor.
Thank you, doctor.
What happened?
She just fainted.
She is alright.
-The doctor--
-Why did you do this?
-Why did you come here?
-Sir!
Don't beat him!
-Did you come to check if she is dead?
-Please stop, sir!
-Sir!
-What is it?
You are very weak.
Why are you both always
full of anger and ego?
You were named Anbu and Arivu only
because you were loving and intelligent.
But neither of you have those qualities.
20 years ago,
I got involved in a matter.
I was severely attacked.
I somehow gathered myself.
My spinal cord was damaged.
Look at them!
Since then she has been
supporting the family.
She got you educated.
She has never sulked about anything.
She has never been harsh with me.
That is love.
She wanted to get you both married.
Is that wrong?
Do we have anyone to support us
in adverse situations?
He won't talk to her directly.
This one will land himself in trouble.
All she ever desired for was
that you both remain united
and support each other till the end.
Have you ever given her peace?
Had something happened to her,
I would have killed both of you.
Don't stand in front of me.
-Go.
-Sir.
-Sit down.
-Ask them to leave.
Sit down.
What did I do?
It happened because of him!
-Why is he angry with me?
-Hey!
Don't act like a fool.
He is not angry but concerned about you.
Keep quiet.
Really? I find it to be stupid!
I will not spare him.
What do you think about yourself?
You have always lived your life your way.
Have you thought about him?
He always bought clothes for you first
and then bought for
himself with the money left.
Do you know what his ambition was?
He was eager to do a Ph.D. in Physics.
He got a seat in IIT Calcutta.
He did not go.
Do you know why?
Considering your education
and the family status,
he chose to rather opt for a job.
And after that, he
showed interest in Kayal.
She is his colleague.
He loved her sincerely.
Give it at the first table.
Get it signed and come to me.
I will take care of it.
Kayal!
Sorry.
I don't know what to say.
I never thought you had feelings for me.
Don't you like me, Kayal?
Nothing like that.
This won't work out. Leave it.
-Why can't this work out?
-I mean…
we belong to different castes.
My family will not agree.
Moreover, my family is
looking for an alliance.
I don't want to invite
unnecessary problems at this time.
Let's avoid it.
I will talk to your parents, Kayal.
You have no problem if they
agree to our marriage, right?
Kayal!
Please give me a chance.
I will talk to your parents.
If they reject me,
I will not disturb you.
Almost everything is fixed.
We are going to the groom's
house tomorrow evening.
Do come before that.
Okay.
I can't do anything if dad rejects you.
Okay. I will come tomorrow.
Did he go and speak?
When you came here the last time,
you beat Nagarajan, right?
They put you in jail.
Do you remember that?
-Why are you deviating from the topic?
-Shut up!
It is connected.
It is connected.
-Sir, please.
-What is it?
Do you understand or not?
He complaint about a murder
and got admitted in hospital.
I can't do anything.
The case is filed.
Meet them in the court.
Try to compromise.
Ask him to withdraw the case.
Then maybe I can try to help you.
There is a holiday
for the next three days.
You can't even get bail.
Dude!
You may go to Kayal's house.
I will take care of this.
No, dude!
My parents will feel bad about it.
We can't let it go.
Poor fellow. Let us finish it first.
We somehow managed to get out by night.
He could not go to Kayal's house.
They arranged her marriage.
My friend lost his love because of you.
Why are you talking in this manner?
That's why he is postponing his marriage.
Is he going to remain single forever?
She got married now.
She is divorced as well.
He wants to try his luck again.
He is helpless.
-He could have tried his luck.
-He did.
But she avoids him.
We know him well.
He does not want to disturb anyone.
The girl he loved…
got transferred to the same office.
Neither can he talk to her nor forget her.
He keeps thinking about her.
He agreed to get married…
so that your marriage
doesn't get affected.
Tell me.
My dear friend…
Anbu is great.
Get lost!
Nonsense!
This can't happen.
Please let it be.
You keep saying this again and again.
But you didn't say that you dislike Anbu.
We will let you go if you tell us that
you don't like him.
Your brother promised to
come home for discussion.
But he never turned up.
You are telling the same now.
We gave you the reason for the same.
Why are you repeating that?
Just think about it.
He is so attached to his brother.
Won't he love you even more?
Try to understand.
Do you like him?
You have confidence in him, right?
I think Kayal loves Anbu.
I also thought the same.
I am sure she loves him.
She was angry that he didn't
turn up at her house that day.
Both fools loved each other.
They never expressed it
and now they have landed in this state.
Shall we speak to Kayal's family?
No, dude! We will
make him speak to her family.
How is it possible?
Will he speak?
He does not know Kayal's residence.
We will take him there.
Do you know the address?
I can find that out.
Who will take him there?
Where are you?
In front of the house.
Don't disclose anything to him or else
he will not come.
Okay, I will take care of it.
Let us go.
What are you doing?
You are the groom.
I will ride the bike.
Aren't your parents coming?
My parents have met her.
Arivu didn't agree to come with me.
He never entertains such things.
Let's go.
He is going with him.
I hope he expresses his feelings.
He should not know our plans.
-He will kill me if he comes to know.
-Isn't that Arivu?
He will not spare us.
-Dude.
-Tell me. Do this work.
-I think Arivu is alone here.
-Really?
He is here with his friend.
Do you see any villagers there?
It's a barren land.
There is no one out here.
You won't get a better opportunity.
-Wait a minute.
-Come quickly.
Okay, I will be there.
He shouldn't come to know about you.
Stay alert.
Sir.
Please sit down.
I will hang up.
I will call you later.
-Greetings.
-Is this Kayal's house?
Yes. She is my daughter.
What is the matter?
He is Anbu. He is her colleague.
I am happy to know that.
Hey!
-Let's go.
-Please wait.
-Hey.
-Please wait.
What do you want?
I am talking to you.
Don't prolong the space
-What do you want?
-Brother.
Please say something.
Pour your heart out.
This is your chance
to speak your heart out.
Without conjoining
Don't go
What do you want?
-I am talking to you.
-I want your daughter.
The moment you asked to say a poem
I have loved her for two years.
She also likes me.
Don't let the time go
Get your daughter married to me.
I'll reach the shore swimming
In the flood of love
I am happy to hear all this.
I will be happy if she
gets settled in life.
You are not scared to speak about it.
What about your family?
What if my daughter comes back
running to me?
She already got divorced once.
Kayal is my life.
I will take good care of her.
Did you discuss it with your family?
Speak to your family and come back.
Hey! Didn't you check the petrol?
Sorry, buddy!
How will we take our men along?
Come with our men in another car.
-Hey.
-Yes, bro.
I ended up pouring my heart out.
How do I tell my parents?
We can ask Arivu to speak about this.
Do you want to ruin it?
Why are you talking in this manner?
He likes you a lot.
-He never lets you down.
-Hey!
-Keep quiet.
-Bro.
What is your problem?
He hit Senthil just
because he attacked you.
Do you remember Nagarajan?
He mocked you by saying
that you are impotent.
That's why he beat him.
It was Arivu's plan to bring
you here to speak to Kayal.
You are the one…
who never understands him.
You always keep complaining.
Do you know why he ends up
fighting with everyone?
He fights because everyone
makes fun of you.
-Get lost.
-Hey.
Where is he now?
There they are.
They are alone.
Hey, dude.
We should finish them today.
They should never mess with us.
Oh, my God!
Stop the bus.
-I did it by mistake!
-Why isn't anyone questioning them?
-My daughter's life is spoiled.
-Throw them out!
Leave my shirt.
Why did you put
your hand on that girl?
Dude, there seems to be a problem.
-I think it is a pickpocket case.
-No!
Our villagers never
have money in their purse.
Let's go and see.
Dude!
-It is your brother-in-law.
-Yes!
I can beat him.
How can strangers beat him?
Go and ask them.
Let's ask them.
Hey! Please move!
Please wait.
What is the problem?
To heck with the problem!
In broad daylight, this fellow--
-Did he pickpocket someone?
-Hey!
-What?
-He molested a girl!
That too in front of her father.
Did he molest a girl?
He tried to molest a girl.
-Let's escape.
-Buddy.
He won't molest anyone.
It would be something else.
-Okay.
-That's when I can support him
and solve the matter between us.
-Go and check.
-Wait, I will do it.
Do you really think this man
would have molested a girl
in broad daylight that
too in front of her father?
Are you not ashamed?
Do you all belong to this village?
-Do you think no one will question?
-What is it?
-What is it?
-A person can't keep marrying girls
just because his hands got
brushed against someone's body.
Hey! What is this?
You are antagonizing your friend.
Buddy, I always support
justice more than friendship.
I will support my brother in law.
Yeah, right! You have different rules
for every person.
-Yeah, right!
-Why do you have
different rules for him and others?
Ask your brother-in-law to marry her.
-Why are you all quiet?
-Hey!
That's not done! That's not possible!
-That can't happen!
-Are you sure?
We will go to the police.
-Call the police.
-Wait a minute.
Come here.
-What class are you studying now?
-Class 11.
She is a school-going girl.
Do you know her age?
-26 years old!
-What--
She is only 16. She is a minor.
Do you know the consequences
-of marrying a minor girl?
-What will happen?
Do you know?
If a complaint is registered,
all of you will be sent to jail.
Are you all ready to go?
-Come on, let's go.
-Are you threatening us?
-Let's deal with it.
-Don't be afraid. I am there for you.
I know Lawyer Bharath Subramaniyam.
-Call him.
-Wait, I will call him.
-Call whoever you like.
-Why don't you call someone?
-I know the MLA.
-I know the MP.
-I know OS
-I know ES.
-Go and call them.
-Give me the phone.
-Call him right away.
-My brother-in-law many of them.
Isn't it, brother?
Is there some kind of a joke going on?
-Hey.
-I am not your brother-in-law.
I will smash you.
Take your hands off.
Don't you dare touch him!
Take your hands off him!
What is going on?
What will you do if
someone tells you that the girl
you're going to marry is
in love with someone else?
I agree that I shouldn't have
believed anything blindly.
What do you want me to do now?
What else should I have done?
It is not only for me.
People force girls to
marry against their wish.
I stopped the marriage as I felt
bad for the girl.
Why are you always quarreling with him?
Why don't you talk it out?
Don't instigate it even more.
Why are you all sitting with sad faces?
No matter what, you all
should feel lucky to have
him as your brother-in-law.
I want to know something.
Do you know that
your sister is a painter?
My buddy conducted an exhibition for her.
Listen to me.
Get her married to my buddy.
She will be happy.
He ruined my love story
and is now in love with my sister.
Do you want me to help him?
That's too much.
I have been in a one-sided love
for the past one and half years.
It was her birthday that day.
I was going to propose to her.
That's when you beat me.
You hit me in front of her.
What is this?
Why are you all
putting the blame on me?
Buddy, you can't lose your temper now.
You've committed many mistakes.
Sorry! It was my mistake.
How do I face her now?
Oh, my God!
He is worse than him.
People are following new ways of lifestyle
but you still seem to be orthodox.
You still follow the idea of giving
greeting cards and roses.
As if he is busy with two girls every day.
Buddy, you are still single, right?
I am fortunate to be
alive in your company.
How will I have girlfriends?
Don't worry about anything.
We will make your love successful.
Are you serious?
The problem is that he beat you
in front of your girlfriend.
Why don't you beat him
up in front of your girl?
She will like you.
The problem will be solved.
-Are you my brother?
-You beat him, right?
-I did for you.
-Did I ask you to help?
I am blessed with an evil family.
Buddy, you just have to act
as if you are beating me.
Don't keep anything in mind
and take revenge against me.
Okay, buddy.
We will meet tomorrow at the same place
and the same time.
Superb! I don't think this will work out.
-I am sure it will work.
-Okay, we shall see!
Bro, just like Sarath Kumar
from Naadodigal--
Sorry! Just like Sasi Kumar,
I am here to help you.
I will take care of it.
Jenny is coming.
That is Jenny.
Hey, she might just leave from here.
-Please draw her attention.
-Sure!
What is it?
-I will draw her attention. Go.
-Hey!
-Just come here.
-Hey, she is here.
Please save him!
Please save him!
Please save him!
Please save him! Sister!
-Please move.
-Please help me out.
-He is a very sensitive fellow.
-Please move!
How will he manage now?
Anyone with a white shawl can save him!
-Leave me!
-Please save me!
-Beat him up!
-He is going to die.
-I am getting late.
-He is going to die.
-Beat me.
-What are you thinking?
You can beat him if you know him.
Oh, God! Please save me from these fools.
Save him.
-Greetings, sir.
-Save him.
Why is everybody silent?
My goodness! The police are here.
-Hey!
-I am caught!
Hey, get lost!
Girls have finally
gathered the courage to study.
Such fights will scare them again!
Fools! Go and help them study!
Sir, he means the world to me.
He is my brother, my friend, my guru.
-Why is he putting me in trouble?
-He is my godfather.
Hey! Take that
handkerchief off your face.
You're behaving as if you are a terrorist.
-Take it off!
-What if the media puts up
my photo in the news?
No one will get married to me.
Are you getting any proposals?
Greetings, sir.
You are creating a ruckus
in front of the college.
You all don't look like college students.
Do we look like professors?
-I will beat you up!
-No, sir.
-It was just for--
-Wait a minute.
Sir, I will tell you what happened…
This guy is my uncle.
-But he is like my brother.
-Are you wearing your undergarments?
Why?
They will take off our clothes now.
-The girl
and this guy were in love and I--
-Sir.
-We got rid of him.
Sir, I am a good boy.
Keep the darkroom ready.
-We need to beat them up.
-Okay.
Oh, my God!
I told you that this plan
will not work out.
He is talking as if he is preparing
for an occasion.
Buddy, I did not know that we have
landed ourselves in trouble?
That day you beat me
severely but no one came out.
-It was just a mockery today.
-What will happen now?
Are we going to be
held for another problem?
I would have begged
her and convinced her.
It was enough that she saw me
get beaten up.
But now, she has seen
me in this state as well.
Here he comes.
Sir, we are good people.
They brainwashed me and got me here.
All of you, get up.
You should have told me that
you know the lawyer, Karthik.
You may leave.
Let us escape.
They may change the case.
Thank you. Who is he?
Is he your family lawyer?
He is my family member.
He is my father.
Lord Jesus has come
in the form of your father.
Sorry.
Is he a dumb fellow?
Is it enough to follow me all the time?
I am waiting for him to talk to me.
Ask him to meet me in the
book shop tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
I will come there.
Even though the idea failed,
but the result made you happy, right?
Thanks, buddy!
Okay, dear.
Bro, don't ditch me just because
your problem got solved.
It is your duty to convince your sister.
What a wonderful family!
Thank God I don't have a sister.
Go and talk to her.
You fell in love, right?
You spoke to her family, right?
Go and speak to mom.
Why don't you talk?
I am scared.
-I will talk later.
-Mom.
Anbu is in love with a girl.
She was my colleague in my old office.
What are you saying?
What will our relative
think if we get him married
to a girl from another caste.
Mom, why didn't you
bother about the relatives
when father was brutally attacked?
You managed the entire house, right?
Are you trying to cool me down?
She is a divorcee as well.
Why are you talking like this, Mom?
They were not compatible enough.
That's why they got divorced.
What would you have done if
you were in her place?
Leave all that.
Anbu liked her.
He worked, paid all the debts,
and got me educated.
Our family is leading a decent life
only because of his hard work.
Has he done anything for himself?
This is the only thing
he has ever asked for.
Can't we fulfill his wish?
Please think about him, Mom.
She is a good girl.
You'll definitely like her.
If she becomes my sister-in-law,
we will always be united.
Please, Mom!
Shall I give my heart to you?
Shall I touch that without breaking?
Let us forget our sorrows
Let us fly high slowly
The heart is light like feathers
He is proud about it.
She is inside.
I brought her to introduce Jenny.
What are you going to do?
I'll take a leave.
Aruna, wait a minute.
Why are you behaving in this manner?
Listen to me!
I'm talking to you.
Aruna!
I am angry but…
Bro, get up.
I understood the value
Of relationship because of you
We will bear the memories
And travel a long distance
Life is a mystery
It changes every time
We will scale new heights
Forgetting this world
We will not be sad anymore
The fog will not last long
It will disappear with the wind
Sorrows will disappear as well
Water has to come to reach the ocean
Come and save me like a friend when I fall
When we cry
The eye don't know about it
When I walk with you
I don't feel any pain
I don't want anything more
How many times have we cried?
How many times have we forgotten that?
It is not trivial to care
Everything is no at peak
We would have enjoyed the minutes
I understood the value
Of relationship because of you
We will bear the memories
And travel a long distance
This life is a mystery
Which transforms on its own
The light of love
Blends with day and night
Why do they cut the power
supply on Friday morning?
Mom!
I want to tell you something.
Tell me quickly.
I have a lot of work to do.
Anbu's family is very good.
Who?
Are they the ones who rejected you?
How does that matter to us?
Anbu is getting married!
He wants to give us an invitation.
How are you related to them?
Who sent the message through you?
Anbu's brother, Arivu…
He is in love with me.
He wants to marry me.
What are you saying?
Mrs. Laxmi!
Mrs. Laxmi, please take the flowers.
Come.
You are my first customer today.
You look like Goddess Laxmi.
I am going to have a good day today.
I will take your leave now.
I didn't do this for money.
Keep it.
Okay. I am coming there.
The cow in my friend's
house has yielded a calf.
I am going there.
Wait a minute. I will be back.
Okay!
What are you saying?
Arivu is a very good boy.
He has a good job and is earning well.
He is a suitable match for Aruna.
Both of them like each other.
Dad will find someone
who matches our status.
Arivu and his mother are
coming to give us the invitation.
Use this opportunity well.
You can tell father that
he looks like a decent guy
and we can get him married to Aruna.
Get me the horoscope.
I will decide only after seeing that.
Welcome.
-Greetings. Please come.
-Greetings.
Please sit.
-Are you fine?
-Yes, I am fine.
-Aruna, prepare tea for them.
-Okay, Mom.
-Senthil, I will be back.
-Okay, Mom.
Why are they here?
Their son, Anbu is getting married.
They have come to invite us.
Have they come to
invite us after insulting us?
You are also encouraging them.
What else do you want me to do?
-Why don't you talk to them?
-Are you mad?
Please come.
They have forgotten
everything and come to our house.
Why are you still thinking about the past?
Please come. Get up.
He is the younger son, Arivu.
He is working in an IT company.
I apologize for whatever happened, Uncle.
Neither of us are at fault.
The prank call was the
reason for everything.
Please forget the past.
Mom, give the invitation.
-Our elder son is getting married.
-Great.
Please don't come.
-Mom, what are you doing?
-Look at my daughter-in-law.
What did you say the other day?
You cursed that my son
will never get married.
You asked me as to
who will marry him, right?
She is going to be my daughter-in-law.
-Your daughter isn't that great.
-Hey!
Keep quiet.
They beat my son and insulted
our family in front of everyone.
-Why should I personally invite them?
-Hey!
-Mom, please keep quiet.
-Mind your words.
My son is getting married on the 24th.
Your daughter is still unmarried.
-Your daughter will elope with someone.
-Hey!
You created a ruckus the other day
at his house.
And today she was insulting my daughter.
You couldn't tell her anything but
you were trying to control me instead.
This stupid woman was
offering coffee to them.
The guy from Aathur was
asking about our daughter.
I am going to accept the proposal.
I will get my daughter married
before his son.
I will handle the situation!
Hey, why don't you both elope
and get married?
What are you saying?
Did I say something wrong?
Don't act like a fool!
We can't run away from the situation.
Will you do it after your marriage?
Do you think dad will
let it go that easily?
What if it lands us at the police station?
That will ruin Anbu and Kayal's wedding.
Listen to me.
I don't know what you will do.
I will wait for you till the
last minute of the wedding.
I trust you.
Two days are left for the wedding.
What should we do?
That is why I gave you
an idea the other day.
-You didn't listen to me.
-Buddy.
Postpone everything
till Anbu gets married.
We can find a way later.
Do you have Aruna's alliance's number?
What happened?
You are Aruna's brother, right?
Useless fellow.
Give me your phone.
I forgot my phone.
Why don't you call from your mobile phone?
Tell me, Venu.
We are taking over a new project.
-We can't extend your leave anymore.
-Okay.
I will be back soon.
You are the project head.
Come back at the earliest.
Okay, Venu, I will come.
Trying to act smart?
You will get stuck in a problem now.
-Hello! Is it Rajesh?
-Hello.
-Yes. Who is speaking?
-Sir.
You are going to get
married to Aruna, right?
Yes. What do you want to do about it?
Sir, Aruna and I love each other.
Nonsense!
What? Do you love each other?
Please understand.
What do you want me to understand?
Why should they fix the
wedding within two weeks?
Think about that.
Do you know that Aruna's marriage
got canceled before this as well.
You must reject the proposal.
Her brother is a mad fellow.
-He does foolish things.
-He is right.
We have done everything, sir.
What do you mean?
We have always been close.
One and half years of love!
We have been to Ooty and Kodaikanal.
We didn't even take a sweater.
Why don't you understand.
Over!
Is that how you spoke to Anbu as well?
I didn't talk much as you were here.
You can get anyone's marriage canceled.
Why don't you take
this as the main business?
It will be good.
-Sorry.
-Why?
Only service. No business.
Good.
-Tell me, sir.
-To heck with you!
I knew something was fishy when you
wanted to get the marriage done soon.
-That is when--
-Please let me talk, sir.
Are you planning to get my
son married to your daughter?
Wait a minute.
Did someone tell you something?
How does that matter?
Why will someone say something
if your daughter was good?
This marriage will not happen.
Put the phone down.
Dammit!
What happened?
Why are you so angry?
It's because of them.
They called this alliance as well.
The groom's father is
asking us to stop the marriage.
How will I face people if the
marriage gets called off again?
If we don't stop them,
they will continue doing this.
I will show them my true colors.
Why do you get tense?
I am worried about my daughter's wedding.
Do you think this is unnecessary?
Do you think I am mad?
Ask your brother to come.
Have your medicine.
Sister, what happened?
Start the car.
-Hey.
-We will go to the hospital.
It is not necessary.
He has high blood pressure.
He has taken medicines.
He will be alright soon.
Brother-in-law.
Tell me.
They stopped Aruna's wedding.
Why haven't they called yet?
Will our plan work?
Wait.
Both the families will blame each other
abuses each other and
then comes to a conclusion.
Wait for some more time.
They will call.
Now that you have informed me,
you can get started with
the marriage preparations.
Marriage will happen.
I will handle the troublemakers.
Finally he got the call.
Tell me, Uncle.
Is everything okay?
-Everything is ruined.
-What happened?
My dad ended up
telling everything to uncle.
He left to abduct the groom.
Not only that.
He is going to keep your
whole family in their custody.
Nothing can be done now.
Hey! Wait a minute.
Let us plan something.
That's what you have been saying.
You don't know anything about my uncle.
Hey! Is he equal to Arnold?
My buddy can fight with
any number of people.
Don't you know that?
Do you know my uncle's name?
Vagaiyara.
Do you know why he is named that?
Have you heard how people
are summoned at court?
They address you by adding
Vagaiyara to your name.
That's how his name was derived.
He is famous in Dindigul.
Try to save yourself.
Did you understand?
I tried to help my brother but
now it's become my problem.
I am being blamed for it.
-Hey!
-Who are you all?
Come with us!
My lover's marriage is happening tomorrow.
My brother is getting
married in the next two days.
Her marriage should be stopped.
My brother's marriage should
happen without any hassle.
I should finish all this and go
back to Chennai next week.
How will it happen?
-Hey.
-Uncle.
Both the families are under my custody.
You need not worry.
The marriage will happen tomorrow morning.
Okay.
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.
Go and get the registrar.
Get the groom and his family ready.
-Bring them to the wedding hall.
-Okay.
Stay here and keep a watch on them.
-What?
-Okay, brother.
No one should until the marriage is over.
We will take care of it.
RAJESH WEDS ARUNA
Are you still sitting here?
Everyone is asking about you.
Please come.
Please go.
I will come.
-The auspicious time will get over.
-Please go.
Uncle.
Is everything alright?
Don't be tense.
I am handling everything well.
The groom's family is here.
The groom and bride
are already on the stage.
What if they create a problem?
We will get insulted once again.
Uncle, I have locked the
entire family in the farmhouse.
People are guarding them as well.
Come and bless the couple.
Please come, Uncle.
Come with me.
-Welcome everybody.
-Please come.
-What happened?
-Please hold him.
-Get up.
-It's nothing.
Don't get tense.
He has blood pressure issues.
Have the tablet.
It's nothing. He is just worried
about the wedding.
He will be very happy
once the marriage is done.
-Hey!
-What happened, Uncle?
He is getting tense.
Exchange the garland.
Yes, he is the one.
Wait a minute.
Do as I say!
Exchange the garland.
Oh, God!
He is not well.
-The groom is changed.
-I will take care of it.
Oh, my God!
The marriage is done.
Why were you tense about it?
BRIDEGROOM INVITES RATHNAVEL, SUMATHI
BRIDE INVITES PONNUSWAMY, LAKSHMI
ALL ARE INVITED
You are a fool!
Uncle, there is a limit for everything.
I took a lot of trouble
to get this wedding done.
The one who spread
the rumors about Aruna
and the one who set all this up is him!
Please don't tell him anything.
I need the photos and
details of the groom's family.
I also need the photo of the
people who are creating trouble.
Just give me the photos.
I will take care of the rest.
It is with Senthil.
Get it from him.
Try to save yourself.
Uncle is asking me to identify the groom.
Have you lost it?
So, your uncle doesn't
know the groom and his family.
He doesn't know me and my family.
Why don't you exchange
the photos and addresses
of the two families and give it to him?
Will this work out?
We will make this happen.
I heard that the groom is from Aathur.
My father might have blurted
because of high blood pressure.
People from Aathur are creating trouble.
He is Arivu.
The groom is Rajesh.
Send the photos to me.
I will take care of it.
Didn't I tell you that he
would get married before me?
I married the girl that
you selected for me.
I had a doubt when
you didn't go to Chennai.
But I did not know that it was this girl.
Finally my elder son will
get married in two days.
I will be happy if this ends well.
