When you are not around, this
patient give me a lot of trouble
He asks me a lot of questions
like when you will come…
Where You have gone
-Look Doctor…
Whether the patient
is rich or poor..
The patient won’t come to a Doctor
if he doesn’t have faith in him
No matter whether the
doctor is big or small

On the first floor, sir
I told you to plan it on
the ground floor, Change it
Bring it to the ground floor
–it’s to late, sir
Construction work has
already commenced
But before the construction work
Has begun, in the final plan…
The operation theater was supposed
to be on the ground floor
Some complication had cropped
up and you were not available…
But Mr.Chaturvedi
asked me to go ahead
Who is Chaturvedi?
Go and get me Mr.Chaturvedi
From the very begining
I been telling you,
I want this Operation theatre on the
ground floor and you..
It’s me – Me, who?
Me! – Oh, well …go ahead
I was taking a bath this morning
And you left without telling me
I told you I was In hurry, Is
this why you’ve called me?
I have drawn a sketch, I want you
to see it, Will you come for lunch?
I could also have seen the
sketch in evening…You…
Yes Sir -One second
Did you tell him to shift the
operation theater to the first floor?
Yes, sir -Why?
I thought it wouldn’t
make a difference
What do you mean by that? As
a doctor, don’t you know…
A patient could have loose his life during
an emergency? -I am sorry sir
Keep the plan with you
and let’s go to the site
Sunil, so many Indian doctors
have settled in the U.S.
Why mustn’t I do the same thing?
I think he is right, Sir
-Thank You
Really? but the doctors
think like this…
What will happen of India? -what
can you find here anyway?
If I settle down there, I’ll get
a lot more money and facilities.
And here we are facing
population explosion
If the population is more,
more people will be ill
If the people are ill, more
doctors will be required
And lady, here you can’t get
your work done by servants
Out there, you will have to
do everything on your own
Not right away, We have
just arrived, You may eat
That’s good, in fact
One need not go on a diet
What are you doing? I have just started
This is my second drink
Guys, this is my second drink, right?
–Right…
Go ahead and eat. And
it’s only 10pm
What are you going
to do at home?
You don’t want to show
me a new sketch, do you?
Sketch?
- Oh Yes, Of late, she’s is very much
Today I was very busy in
the hospital, she rang me up
I asked whether it was important
She said yes
“I got to show you anew sketch”
I have seen her paintings
a couple of times
I didn’t know which
side to look it from
Left, Right, Top or bottom? it
looked the same from everywhere
Are you angry with me?
What’s up? You are so quite,
You just don’t speak
If you don’t wish to talk,
May I get a book for you?
Write all your complaints in that
Complaints from me?
I have got such a big house,
servants to work for me, …
A car to move about in, a TV and
a radio for entertainment, …
And a telephone to communicate
All these things are there
I have no complaints
You never promised to

Wait, I will just ask Mrs. Sunil Gupta
and let you know
I can not stand anymore, Sister
-But
Sunil was not like that
He was not, but now a day he
is so much lost in his own work
He has no value fore me
As if I do not exist
What are saying, Sunil has given
you everything
Car, Bunglow...
- I did not ask for all these
Sister, I'm not one of those women
Who are satisfied with all these
I just wanted his love, his company
We were so happy in that small house
As wealth grows,
happiness gets away from me
And the distance between us kept growing
It was heard that after marriage,
the two get together
But, we two remain two
It was good to be alone
No aarti, Don't feel so bad about it
Sister, you won't understand
The one who feels lonely knows
What she goes through
You don't worry, this time
I personally come with you
and explain Sunil
No sister, that is of no use
He should understand himself,
my pain
I have decided
Unless he come himself and take
me with him, I won't go from here
Rosy, Did you change it's location?
- No Sir
If I change, madam will replace me
and send me to Goa
So did it move by itself
-I think so -What?
No Sir, Madam told watchman to keep it here
Bahadur
Get Ladder -I won't
Why? -Once I climb the ladder
One person took away ladder
Full day I was on top and
The mosquito ate me
If you want I can get small table
-OK get that -I will get that
Sister, can we go for picnic tomorrow?
- Not picnic, will go to see film
No mom will go to see Circus
-Not at all -In circus there are lions
No, No... there is lot of confusion
We will make slips -wonderfull
See in slip we will get Picture only
-no mama we will get circus
Tell me what yours, spell the circus
Whereyou want to go?
Picnic -Aunty Circus -You?
- Film
No mama circus -Keep quiet, You?
I wanted to go for hunting, but
will go where my wife want to go
Film -Major will go to see film,
-You -and me it's secret
Now see amazing
-See it will be film only
See mummy I only will win, not you
let me see, not you,
partner you select -Circus
Well done, ley me read
Let us see awesome slip
What is it? It's Picnic
Look, it's picnic -We lost hunting
as well as film
If we are going for picnis, why don't
we go to Nandgaon? -Will go to Bhushi Dam
Hunting, Hunting, you know anything else
Raju, why are sitting sad
-He exactly like his mother
Your partner only removed the slip,
we will go to circus some other time
Will show you elephant, hourse, camal,
everything, Come on get up
So tomorrow at what time?-At 9:30
-Ok Raju tomorrow at 9:30 sharp
My big rose -Yes
-It smells good
Just open the lid, let me test it
-What are you doing?
You can not test it
Rosy -Whenever I try to test it
someone comes in
Is food ready, It ready from tomorrow,
-What? -I mean it's from long
Good morning, Good morning everybody,
lovely weather no rain, everything ready
Where is Majer?
- Good morning
Good Morning -Army man never late
-Good Morning sir
Where is Sister & Raju?
- There is small problem
Raju got wet in rain yesterday so he
is having fever, if goes out it may incrase
Let's go and see him -No no hold on
Somehave I manage to convence him
If you go, he will again start crying
You both carry on,
What say Vinod?
I don't get into fight of sis and bro
in law, if you want we will put slips
There is no need of slips
-Correct, no need of slips
Brother in law, picnic cancelled
That's right, picnic cancelled
-Why to cancelled picnic for this
This is also right,
why to cancell picnic?
It doesn't look nice, there is
more fun, if we go together
This is also right, we all shold
go together
Aarti, you rearly come to this place,
we have gone there many times
This is also right, they
have gone there many times
Now I am not going to remove my
glasses any more, decide fast
You both just go -let's go
Good -She is gone
Even after retirment, your habit
of giving orders not gone
You sent her alone -How alone?
Vinod is also with her
So what? Aarti is our responsibility
If Sunil comes to know about it,
what will he think?
But you were saying,
Both studied together
May be, but now Aarti is married
After marriage, women become more
intelligent, except you
What did you say?
Nothing, speak softly, Raju will get up
Don't talk
Don't know, Where both will be
roaming alone?
Listen one more, in winter a person
was giving bath to his cat
A passerby said, cat will die in this cold
He said go away and let
me do my job
second is person went away,
After some time
Same person saw, the first person
crying carrying cat on his lap
I had told, she will die
he said she died by not bathing
by squeezing
What's wrong, I keep on talking
and you are so quiet
If you wanted to be so silent,
why did you come for picnic?
Picnic was just a excuse
I had heard, Here a monk lives,
who is good at hand reading
Not met -How not met?
That wise man is in front of you
Anything -Show me your hand, till date,
whatever was told has come true
What a lines? You have age of 99
The line of fate is so strong,
Whoever comes near becomes lucky
But, But, Shadow of saturn on mars
Got nothing even after having everything,
that's why mind is worried
But, thumb is straight
That means will power
-What? -self power
whatever you think, you do it
-Yes -Yes
your hand shows, it's going to rain now
-You are lying -I am not lying, you saw
You will get wet -I don't need this
-Take it
You -Don't worry, I am waterproof,
you will get wet, wear it
The rain is increasing
-Yes, it is increasing
Keep raining...
You are really crazy, rain is already
increasing and you are singing for rain
OK than, I will sing to stop the rain
Do not rain...
Ever in your life you were serious
Aarti, if person is always appears happy,
that does not mean he has no sadness
What can make you sad, You are alone,
you don't have anybody
May be that is the reason
Sadness can be shared,
Someone has said it correct
You share your happiness, it gets double
and if you share your sorrows it gets half
But, With whom to share
-Find someone
Don't get so easily -If you try sincerely
you will definitely get
Rain Stopped, Let's go
God bless you
Appearing waterproof,
You realised now
What is this -tea with ginger
Medicine for cold
Tell me one thing, When you got married
Then your husband put the garland
or stethoscope
You became doctor -quiet
Is it must -Absolutely must
Wow, I enjoyed
-Than why you were acting
Mind was seeking happiness
-Yes I was, But..
But means, I mean
Why you came yourself,
could have sent through someone
Why, you were not keeping well,
What is wrong If I get it
Nothing happened
Realized one thing
You must have someone
That's why I am saying,
make someone yours quickly
A wise companion should also be found
You will get it
it's not that easy
Find the right partner at the right time
It's a coincidence
See, If you meet someone sometimes
Within two to four days it seems
like you know for years
And sometimes even after staying
together for years
Kept reading book of life and
never came to know the story
Listen, there is more tea in thermos,
If you want you can have it
How is Raju? You know kids
get seek fast and get well soon
Hello, God morning everybody
-Good morning -Good morning Vinod
How are you -Fine -How
was picnic? -first class

wear a sweater? -It's nothing

Correct, I too.. -Major, Hats off to Aarti
Yesterday we walk too far, but she did
not tired -Why? You forgot
Aarti never loses
After all, she is my sister in law
of army man
That means major, you are taking
credit of this -Why not?
I chose Sunil for her
I got her bungalow
I fixed it and it's decoration etc..
-That was by me
That's true, but hurry up, it
taking long time
Major this is not like fighting,
to happen fast
It's a matter of art, slowly...
Even we are not in hurry
Saw, she understand it
-Listen
You are leaving? -No major it's not
like that -Why brother in law?
What is the matter -Aarti you won't
understand, this person sometime
has a habit of disappearing
-No major no slander
Very intresting person -Yes
-Laughing most of the time
Aarti, just listen
You shoul not mix up with unknown man
-What sister, you too...
Speak softly -You started lecture
It's not lecture, I know you have
habit of talking friendly
But, you don't know, what is in
his mind? -Sister I am not a kid
Speak softly -Mummy my bat
broke down
Ok, we will get new one
-When will you get?
You told me to give Camera on Birthday
that is also not given -Go and paly

Sometimes I feel like going back

What? Miscarriage
I am sorry, I could not

How is Aarti? -She is fine
Sunil, it would be

We came to see the Mahakali Temple.
Have you came here with a wish?
Inspector, I will go with them.
Why did you go tot the police station?
To enquiry about a dead body
-Dead Body?
Yes, yesterday when I was coming, I
came across a womens dead body
I intimated the police. At first
I thought it was a accident,
On investigation it was found out
That her husband was suspicious…
About her, and so he killed her.
Since I intimated the police,
They wanted my statement.
Lets go.
Go on, Chaturvedi. Who, me?
No, I will be
Staying here for 3-4 days.
Who? Mr.Biharilal?
If he has problem with his sleep,
Give him some tranquilizer
Yes, its okay. It’s
not a big problem,
You take care of it.
It's not big problem
No, I will be here for another
3-4 days. Anything else?
No Problems, OK.
If there is any urgency,
We will go back.
What happened? -Why?
Why? When I am there you always
Complain that I don’t give the company
When I give the company,
You want me to go back
I thought it was something very urgent.
- Its not urgent there, but here
What’s so urgent here?
It is urgent, isn’t it?
Get in
Sunil, please come soon
What happened? -Look,
He is wounded.
Sit down here. Rosy,
fetch some warm water
Bring my bag. -OK sir
Who is he? -Vinod, your
interior decorator.
Yes, He is the man
What happened to him? He’s
is the habit of drinking
He might have been hit by some truck
Doesn’t look like
An accident injury
Didn’t you ask him?
- He wont say a word
What? What are they saying?
How can it happen?
I am speaking the truth.
He is sitting right there
Inside? -Yes
Let’s go and see. Doesn’t
-he have any relatives here?
I don’t think so. He
never mentioned any
Good Morning, What happened to him?
- Exactly what I suspected.
What suspicion? -An
injury to the brain
He has lost his memory
Will he always be like this?
- It will take some time.
Will he stay here until then?
Where he will get the
Better doctor than Sunil?
Bahadur… -Coming, Sir
Have you made the bed? -Yes Sir
Take him inside.
Aarti, that means,
We.. to live man
It's good, at least
We are saved from sin
Now it's better we forget
this incident
Sister, I will tell everything to Sunil
-No No, Are you gone mad
Don't you know Sunil?
If Sunil comes to know
Vinod used to study with you and
used to love him
But I did not like him -But how will
you make Sunil understand this
He will misunderstand you
-But you know everything, Sister
I know, God knows, But Sunil
doesn't know
Blood stains may disappear, but
Doubt never fades
If Sunil misunderstood you,
nobody will trust you
And than, You will never be able to
proove yourself innocent
Lest it happen, that your little mistake,
may ruin your family life
Aarti, These secrets will remain
with us
If Vinod said anything to Sunil?
He has lots of misunderstaning
regarding me
There is only one way, before he regain
his memory
somehow he shuold be removed
from this house
You are throwing your the best cards.
- I don’t need your help
Okay, try this
Doctor, I didn’t get a
single card till now
I’ve got a full hand!
Your turn, madam
Come in -Me pack -Vinod come sit down
-You packed?
You want to play? -you are
a strange man, major
He has lost his memory,
-oh, I forgot
But you had told me that he will
Regain his memory gradually
In such cases patient tries
to Remember old memories
Like school or college days
And then slowly he tries to
Remember his recent past
I think we should try to make
Him remember his old days
Aarti can solve this problem
-How?
They were college
mates, -Right, vidya?
Yes. -Really? You never
told me about it
I thought I told you
Madam, the food is ready.
- Let me see
Then I think it will
be easy for me.
Aarti, Do you have another pen? The
refill In this pen has exhausted
Put a refill in this
What’s the matter?
- Will he stay here
Who? -He
Vinod? -Yes
Yes. -Is it necessary?
Why? He use to stay
Here even earlier
But not in this condition
Why don’t you admit him
to A government hospital?
I see. So you know his
Condition better than me?
He is not that serious to Be
admitted in the hospital
Besides, I’m here too. Why…?
You have a problem with him?
Why should I be worried?
Mr. Sharma
-Don’t talk to me
I am angry with you -Why?
What happened?
You never met me
after coming here
I came two days back. -Two days? I
met your wife here last Sunday
She has been here for some time
-Has she come all alone?
Yes
But I have seen a young, handsome
Man with her..forget it
What’s the matter? -Forget it
You come to my house today
-What’s special day?
Todays my birthday -But I got
some guest at my place
Bring them along too -Okay

Where is Sir? -To get medicine
-You go to kitchen
Bahadur, go and clean the garage
-OK madam
Whast are looking at? -Where?
Are you really forgottan everything?
How is it possible? So many things have
happened and you don't know anything
Yes
It's Good Vinod, that you are escaped
but tell me onething
Why you came here? -Do you want to
spoil my life?
I didn't get you? you know everything
You are acting now, What do you want
from me after all
You know it very well, you won't get
anything from me,
Didn't I tell you same thing that night?
Night -Yes, that night
That dark night, worst night of my life
I want to forget it
I want to forget it forever
Whatever happened that night
Should remain between us
It will be good for both of us
Listen. If you really love me..

Please forget that night.
Go away from here
But I have seen a young, handsome
Man with her..forget it.
Whatever happened that night

Tell me something. Have

Listen, I have
something to tell you
Are you angry with me?
What’s the matter?
Don’t you know?
You are misunderstanding me
I used to misunderstand you
It’s not as you are thinking it is
What? What did you say?
It’s not as you are thinking it is
If you can’t diagnose the disease
by looking at the patient face…
Then you are not a doctor at all
-Won’t you listen to me?
What is left to listen to?
Yes, there is. There’s so
much I said until today?
I have only been listening
And enduring until now
You have no right to suspect
me without clarifying with me
Those who have no proof of the truth
Resort to raising there voices
Sister, I am going, Where?
Even I do not know
Sunil's suspicion has turned into hatred
And I do not have any evidence,
by which he can trust me
Only you know the truth
If husband does not have any respect for
his wife then she starts burdening him
If I stay here,
He will be sad to see me
I don't want this, I
wish he knew the truth,
So we don't get separated like this
No!
Doctor, I want to tell you something.
- I don’t want to hear anything
Aarti -You -Come with me
No -Come on -Where?
- Where you should go
You were going away,
Leaving me all alone?
Vinod told me.. -I came
to do the interiors here
But I created misunderstanding
Between the two of you
I can’t even apologise to you
For the mistake I have made
You can be a friend
I know that misunderstanding can
Cause a lot of problems. But
sometimes the problem itself
Can solve the misunderstanding. And
thus, I have realized my mistake
I have drifted far away from Aarti.
But now I am closer to
Her than ever before
I recognize every disease in the world
But you r mind, which is part of life
Couldn't recognize it
Please forgive...
The End…
