Thanks, Jill.
Oh, good, Jeff--
yeah, we'll hear all about your
ideas in the room, all right?
With all due respect, Jeff...
I don't think we need a
cyber-security firm right now...
I think we need the president...
And a plan.
I can put a team on the ground
to attack in a matter of momen--
this isn't a terrorist cell
out of Damascus.
We can't just blow up
the Internet.
This is a single server
we're talking about here.
The possibilities are endless.
I understand very well the
complexities of the Internet.
I don't think you do. Oh, I do.
Gentlemen, please let me finish.
These terrorists sent text
messages...
To very specific cell phones.
Only individuals directly
connected to the markets.
I don't know why they'd warn
the rich stockbrokers...
But they said that they've
already hacked...
The New York stock exchange
backup.
We ran a security protocol
and it checks out.
- We found a breach.
- Jeff?
- Yes, Sarah?
There will absolutely be a run
on the banks. On everything.
And eventually if we cross our
fingers, and pray hard enough...
And we get the markets back
online, those, too.
You're assuming that this
is what...
Puts the public over the edge,
the tipping point.
That's right. Finally
revolting.
Getting up off their couches.
Yes!
Running to the bank to get the--
yes. Yes. Yes.
Stuff it in their mattress?
Yes, that is what I'm saying.
We are not looking at
bankruptcy.
We'd like to present an option.
These terrorists used a stolen
software program...
To hack the market.
This is the man who created it
six months ago...
To increase his company's
earnings on the...
Mercantile exchange by about
a billion dollars.
I think we bring him in,
see if has any ideas.
That's ridiculous. I'm sorry,
Paul?
You can't be serious.
Guy Clifton, guy Clifton...
Helped revolutionize how
cities consolidate...
He's in the middle
of a federal hearing.
...and manage debt.
He's about to be indicted.
Guy Clifton is being indicted
because he broke through...
The same firewalls these
terrorists have.
Excuse me. Who the hell
is guy Clifton?
Announcer the barometer
of America's prosperity...
 Traditionally has been the
 stock exchange.
 The New York stock exchange
 is almost as old...
 As America itself...
 Being founded in 1792...
 During George Washington's
 first administration.
 67 years ago, 24 men met
 under a buttonwood tree...
 At 68 wall street
 for the purpose...
 Of trading and government
 bonds.
 Wall street has become the
 symbol of money.
 Everybody, it seemed...
 Was on the way to becoming
 a millionaire.
There were plenty of buyers.
Not enough stock to go around.
 Wait your turn.
 It was unheard of.
 Those who shouted the loudest
 got in the firstest.
 And then all of a sudden,
 wham-o!
 The next day, the Piper had
 to be paid, and in full.
 The incredible boom became an
 even more incredible bust...
 As the country plunged into
 the depths of a depression.
We made realistic rules so that
it could never happen again.
Today you have a sounder,
more efficient stock exchange.
It's the storehouse of funds...
 For America's ever growing
 industry.
All right, we're live
in five, four, three...
Guy Clifton, the man who just
two years ago...
Pulled Chicago out
of bankruptcy...
Is now facing multiple charges
in connection...
With an incident on the
Chicago mercantile exchange...
Where trading activity
was manipulated.
 Manipulated.
 He rose fast through the
 ranks...
Youngest ever to achieve a spot
on a mercantile exchange floor.
Quickly made a name for himself
and went on to found...
Clifton holdings, before
assisting mayor rahm Emmanuel..
Shut it off, please.
...in eradicating Chicago's
debt entirely.
 Ultimately though, money got
 the better of him...
 When he recruited three close
 friends to hack...
The Chicago mercantile exchange
and manipulate...
 His company's earnings
 on the market.
 We'll be right back with more
 on this sad story of--
hey.
Hi.
New book?
No, it's for school.
Ah...
You caught up at school?
Keeping up okay?
Did mom tell you to say that?
You're a wise-ass. No.
You know, the last time we
talked like this...
I think I was doing...
That stupid report
on local heroes.
Do you remember?
No.
No?
Yeah.
Well, my teacher told
the whole class...
That you had saved Chicago
from bankruptcy.
She said, "this, kids...
"Is the perfect example
of a local hero."
And now you're going to jail.
Was it just all for the money?
I think we have enough.
Who said that?
Mom says that.
Mom says I'm going to jail?
No, my econ teacher says
you're going to jail.
He says that's an absolute.
Ah, an absolute.
Mm-hm, mom says we have
too much money.
We've been awaiting the arrival
of guy Clifton...
For almost an hour now.
This must really be testing...
The judiciary committee members
inside, Paul.
Now, this is just an
informational hearing.
What do you think?
Should I call him?
Yeah, I'll call him.
Hey.
Where's creason?
Where's creason?
She left an hour ago.
Like everyone else.
Well, what did you think?
Everyone was just gonna wait
for you?
They're just looking to acquire
whatever information they can...
About how Mr. Clifton
and a team of three...
Were able to hack the market.
It just doesn't look good...
To keep a committee waiting
like this.
I revolutionized the market.
I found loopholes.
I've done things no one's
ever done before.
What are they gonna
indict me on?
You hacked the stock market.
No one's ever done that before.
It doesn't make it legal, guy.
Are you beginning to see...
That this is about more
than money, guy?
Let me tell you something.
It's always about money.
If I wasn't rich, they wouldn't
be indicting--
Mr. Clifton.
Yeah, can I help you, boys?
Guy Clifton?
Your presence has been
requested.
It's a matter of national
security, Mr. Clifton.
Really?
Please come with us.
Okay.
I have to go.
If you're not going straight to
jail, then dinner's at 8:00.
All right.
Do you have any idea where
they're taking him?
I do not.
No.
This way, Mr. Clifton.
"The government may try to
suppress us...
"But they will not
annihilate us."
"We seek justice against the
deceptive capitalist liars."
The backside decrypts to a map
of the United States...
Targeting the following cities
and their respective markets.
Now, the specifics behind
motive and culprit...
Is classified at this point.
But I can tell you, they've
already breached...
The New York stock exchange
backup server.
So, in front of you is the
review of my projections...
For total market failure.
And these are the new
international numbers...
You're getting now.
Thanks, Mel.
The reason why we're all here in
this room today, Ms. schwab.
So as I was--
sorry. So sorry.
Busy, busy day. Thank you.
Yeah, just get me a green tea.
Please... continue.
As I was saying, there is a
potential for this attack...
To have global implications.
Hijacking our entire market
system could throw us into--
what is she talking about?
...Total market failure.
Our economy's on track.
September 3rd, 1929,
we were on track, too.
One month later, less so.
This is not the
great depression, schwab.
People have lost faith
in the system.
Too big to fail is a thing
of the past.
Am I the only one in the room
who thinks...
It wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world...
To be a bit more prepared?
Prepared for what? Bankruptcy?
Correct.
Hm.
We have till Monday.
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.
Then I want you to call my wife,
tell her I'm okay.
Clifton!
Yeah. Do that now, please.
Well, what do you think?
I think I'm gonna move
my money offshore.
That's what I think.
Come on. Help me fix this.
What's in it for me?
You'd better sell that mutual
fund, schwab.
Fuck. Douchebag.
What do you want for
dinner? I was thinking salmon...
Creason likes salmon.
I hate fish. I hate fish.
I hate fish.
We'll do salmon.
Who'd you give my office to?
You never used your office,
babe.
I used my office.
I used it once.
You know what else?
I gotta get your
access card back.
It's called the Clifton-Willis
foundation.
I know. Hold on.
Hey, can you get Andrew
on the phone?
I gotta talk about the--
i gotta go.
Wait. Hey, come back.
Come back!
You yell at me in the hallway?
Come back.
What?
Creason's rejecting the chemo
like they said she might.
Okay. Well, what do we do?
She's sad.
You should probably talk
to her...
Before they take you off
to prison.
I have Angela on the phone...
About the outreach program.
What?
What do they even have?
What do they got?
Obstructing justice. Tampering.
You hijacked a market, too!
Oh, that's a bunch of bullshit.
Guy, I'd start making
preparations.
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Clifton. Take care.
Announcer Clifton
manipulated the market...
 In an unprecedented fashion.
 This is all new in the age
 of cyber warfare.
 I mean, he's an American who
 infiltrated the markets.
 I think they'll have to come
 down hard on him.
 I really do. They have
 to set an example.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
 Schwab
 hello?
Hey, it's guy Clifton.
 What can I do for you?
Look, I think I have
a solution.
I'm gonna need immunity.
So, the attacks will hit
the computers that...
Tabulate the trades on all
the markets.
So we need to reroute our
markets...
To another computer's server...
One the hijackers don't
know about.
This is what I'll create...
Build.
Warm this up, please.
So the hackers don't know
it exists.
Is that possible?
Is that possible?
It's how he did it.
How he did what?
Well, he tried this before.
He attempted--
will it work?
I mean, if it's worked before...
It didn't work.
Support--
gentlemen, excuse me.
It's possible. It is possible.
He attempted to do it,
but it didn't work.
With your support--
and my team, we will do it.
Jeff, what he did is not
exactly legal.
This can be ready for the
markets by Monday?
Yeah, I just-- I need access
to the server codes.
So we're just gonna hand over
the keys to a market system.
Give us a minute, guy.
Sure.
Thanks for your time.
He's in the middle of a major
public indictment.
He's the only one who can
do this, Richard.
This happened in Hong Kong.
The markets dropped 38%
overnight...
And next day they recovered.
Right, but this is different.
I mean, there is...
These cyber threats have no
lasting implications..
On any market ever.
This is different.
You know this is different.
This is global.
Jeff, we've been through this.
Is his personal life in order?
Yes. He's good.
Okay.
Do me a favor.
Let me bring bankruptcy
projections to Jeff.
Runs on the goddamn bank.
Respectfully, I don't work
for the goddamn bank.
I work for the goddamn
white house.
This has to work.
I know.
Then you should also know this.
If it doesn't, they'll pull
your immunity.
Assemble the team.
I need you to talk to them.
Well, yeah, 'cause they all
fucking hate you.
Yeah, I know that.
Well, if you know that, then
it's a non-starter, isn't it?
What am I supposed to tell
my board?
That I'm prancing around
collecting criminals...
For guy Clifton's latest
project?
I have a company to run,
too, guy.
It's a non-profit.
Did you really just fucking
say that?
It's your daughter's non-profit.
You know what you should tell
the board?
What?
That I get full immunity.
So that our daughter can
have two parents.
So, George, Amelia, who else?
Ben?
Ben.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Yup.
Ben just went dark on me.
After you manipulated him into
hijacking an entire market.
I don't know. Maybe I could
put some feelers out.
I could--
you know, I could probably write
this program myself.
No, you can't.
I can.
I know where he is.
Hi.
Mrs. Clifton?
Babe, who is it?
Hey.
Who is it?
It's--
it's your mother.
What are you doing here?
Well, I've got some business
with Ben.
Business?
Yes.
I'll tell you about it later.
Should I have told you
about this?
Oh, I already knew about this.
I'll take a shower.
Okay?
Okay.
This is real.
We're just taking certain
things slow.
Oh, yes, I imagine she's
waiting to see...
If you turn out like her
father.
She's still in high school.
It's very mature of you
to recognize that.
 Man for Ben...
Are you busy?
Yes.
I'm calling from chase collec--
oh. With what?
Coding. Algorithms.
The usual.
I've got a job for you.
I-- I don't think I'm cut out
for the non-profit sector.
Really? It's a good job.
High six figures.
Six figures?
No.
He's such a coward.
Sending his wife up here
to recruit for him.
He must be truly desperate.
And you know you can't trust
a desperate man.
He's not desperate, Ben.
He's sorry about what happened.
I felt like Einstein.
You felt like Einstein?
I felt like Einstein.
I felt like I developed
this amazing thing.
What do you mean, "turn out
like her father?"
What?
You said creason's waiting
to see...
If I turn out like her father.
The markets.
It's all just fake numbers
and projections.
It's hard to stay truthful
in a world like that.
She doesn't want me
to be a trader.
She doesn't want you
to be a liar.
Will you do this job for me?
How'd it go?
Coward.
What does that mean?
Is he in?
You lied to that poor boy.
You made him hack the markets...
And he doesn't trust you.
I didn't lie to anybody.
My company created an algorithm.
He was an employee.
He stole from me.
Aw, fuck.
Do I go talk to him?
No.
No?
I'm gonna go talk to him.
He's in, guy.
Of course, he's in.
Of course, he's in.
Your daughter also just had
sex with him upstairs.
What?
Do you even know how
to drive a fucking car?
I need a barf bag like
they have in the airplanes.
She's the nurse the insurance
company gave me.
That's why she's retarded.
It wasn't my choice.
Jesus, George, calm down.
She fucking drives like
a maniac.
She's trying to fucking kill me.
It's ridiculous.
Crazy bitch.
I missed you.
This better be good.
Who's this?
Hey, George.
Oh my god, look at that hot
piece of ass.
Mm-mm... let's roll, nursie.
Keep it up. Keep it up.
Rolling.
Rolling with my nursie.
There's gonna be some boundaries
while we're here in my house.
Yeah?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh! Easy. I mean...
You want a hand?
Yeah, could somebody help
this thing in?
All right, come on.
These terrorists have hijacked
our central servers.
So, George, you're gonna
repatch the markets...
To a shadow server I found
in Iceland.
Ben, you'll use the program
we already created...
To distribute information back
to the traders...
While Amelia monitors market
trends...
And transactional process.
Yes?
I got a two part question.
First, what happens if we
fail...
And second part, what's gonna
happen to the rest of the world?
We're not gonna fail.
The rest of the world
will be fine.
How can you be so sure?
You can guarantee?
We're not gonna fail because...
This is nothing new for us.
How can you be glib?
Because-- glib?
I'm not glib. I trust you.
We can do this.
We just need to focus.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
She got her mother's looks.
I know you all hate me right now
for what I've put you through...
And I don't blame you.
But not a single one of you
would have showed up...
If you didn't have something
to prove.
So, George, we're not going
to fail.
That's glib, my friend.
I found the spot.
It's low-key, secure.
I think it'll work just fine.
We're gonna need plausible
deniability.
It would be bad if you failed.
Guy
the first thing I want to do...
 Is route market observation
 and analytics...
 Through the living room here.
 That's our control center.
Amelia.
Yeah, I know.
You're not gonna be monitoring
one market like last time.
Every market.
Every market.
I feel like you're secretly
happy...
That I'm back in the house.
I don't think you should use
the word happy.
Guys, the floors! Guys!
$80 a square foot. Please.
What the fuck's going on?
What?
Are they gonna zip tie these
cables and hug 'em to the walls?
Yeah, guys, guys, let's zip
tie these cables...
Hug 'em to the walls.
George, I'm gonna put you
upstairs next to creason's room.
It'll be easiest to route the
network...
Through the window up there.
Guy, are you serious? Shit.
What?
I can't climb stairs.
If I get up there and find
out...
You're in my wheelchair again,
so help me fucking god!
Hurry, hurry, it's not arts
and crafts.
So, Hong Kong on tech 3,
4 on board 1.
And then we're gonna do
Philadelphia.
Euro. Amsterdam.
Let's do Amsterdam 2, 1.
I said-- I said 4, 4.
You said 3, 4.
No, I said 4, 4.
No, you didn't.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
All right.
No? All right.
You don't got-- you don't got to
be such a bitch about it.
Come on.
Let's repatch this and then
let's get to London.
London on 2, 3.
That leaves one open room
for you, Ben.
The closet in my room.
It'll be nice and cozy.
Plenty of solitary focus...
For you to work out all the
programming kinks.
Oh, hey.
I think my mother's closet
really suits you.
This is ridiculous.
This status report is being
delivered...
To the white house as
we speak.
Clifton and his team are running
a diagnostic test.
A rehearsal, so to speak, to
work out the kinks.
This should last between
6 and 8 hours...
At which point they'll be ready
for market.
I've advised the white house
to prepare two speeches...
For the president to address
both outcomes.
But I have every confidence
Clifton will succeed.
Automated voice
identification confirmed.
 Patching you into the house
 right now, Ms. schwab.
Initiating the market
simulation.
Time to test this bad boy.
Ben, I'm sending you the London
to New York stuff now.
My price movements lagging
by maybe 15 minutes.
George, let's add Miami.
We have too many main market
patches running on board 2.
Retard, this is board 1
and this is board 2.
Come on, get with me, nurse.
You want to do it yourself?
That's what she said.
Let's add Miami to the
diagnostic, please.
 Initiating Miami
 simulation now.
What are we waiting for?
There it is.
 Can I get an update
 on the price movements?
All right, we got major spikes
of activity in...
C-bot, Amsterdam and Atlanta.
George, let's get a status
update. George.
Hey. Hello? Hello!
Hello, I'm not doing this
for my health, okay?
Jesus, I can hear you upstairs.
I need to talk to people.
Try pressing the button on the
walkie-talkie.
Okay, we got major spikes
in activity in...
Amsterdam, c-bot and Atlanta.
Let's try rerouting a couple
of things, then.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
We don't have servers.
Hey, we got a problem.
I mean, this is fucking
ridiculous.
You got me working upstairs
in your wife's closet?
Hey, what's the issue?
You shut the-- nothing.
You're under surveillance.
This is what this looks like.
You stay the fuck away
from my daughter.
We don't have a server
big enough.
What about Amazon?
We can't find a server big
enough.
We need 5% of the Internet.
The fastest 5%.
Zero latency bandwidth.
We need Facebook or netflix.
It's just not gonna work.
This is bullshit.
Unless somebody has a really
big fucking server...
That I don't know about.
I don't like this bullshit
as much as you don't like it.
It's a control kick.
Wait. Wait.
Control kick, my friend,
this is my daughter.
Probably.
Excuse me?
 We have a server.
We have a server.
Oh, my gosh.
This is it?
Yup, this is it.
This is our post-9/11 backup
shadow stock market.
In a tug boat.
I know.
What is this?
What is this thing here?
Where's the server?
That's the server.
Over that barge.
It's all mobile.
We moved it every 3 to 5 days
for security.
What can I say, it worked
for Saddam, until it didn't.
And it's all nuclear-powered.
And the only reason
it's still here...
Is we haven't figured out
how to dispose of it yet.
Oh, that's comforting.
Yeah, we cautioned the bush
administration that this...
Unit would be shut down even
before they ever tested it.
But no one likes to listen to
what no one wants to hear.
Listen to what?
That the banks...
Would create their own backup
systems privately.
I mean, who do you trust less
than government?
Oh, I don't know. Banks?
Back-end server codes.
Have fun.
Well went dry on messengers?
Using highly classified
server codes...
To rewire the American
market system...
Isn't exactly a small thing.
And it would be negligent of me
not to stay informed.
Yeah.
You hacked the nasdaq and the
New York stock exchange.
He doesn't like that word.
I don't like that word.
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.
You held them for 11 hours.
And a half.
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.
You held nasdaq and the New York
stock exchange...
For 11 and a half hours.
What happened?
Something went wrong.
Was it with the program
you wrote?
Guy didn't write the program.
I developed the program.
You didn't develop it, either.
Guy? Guy?
Sarah.
Who wrote the program?
Who wrote the program?
Who wrote the program
is irrelevant.
What went wrong, guy?
You went wrong, Ben.
You went wrong.
So I never should have asked
you to do this.
You didn't ask me, you fucking
coward. Your wife asked me.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
You've been thinking about this
every waking goddamn second.
I was so close to the
finish line.
So close we could touch it.
Close to what?
Hacking our way to the top?
It doesn't matter how you get
to the mountain top, son.
You either make it or you don't.
We were there. We were there.
I used to believe what
you would say.
Stop with this...
"I could have been a contender"
bullshit, all right?
You're a fucking criminal
and you can live with that.
Ben wrote the program.
Then he pulled the plug.
Why?
It was the right thing to do.
How are we going to handle this?
Handle what?
Handle creason.
How are we going to handle
creason?
She just can't carry on
with this stuff.
She's 18. He's 25.
I'll just forbid it.
You'll forbid it?
Yes.
Why? 'Cause it's what's
best for her?
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
This isn't about her.
Punish your daughter because
Ben has a moral compass?
Oh, obviously not a sexual
moral compass.
You know what I mean.
She can't see him anymore.
Period!
You have no idea what
he did to me.
He pulled a power play that day
to fuck me.
He's having sex with our
daughter to fuck me.
I don't know why he pulled the
plug, but Ben was doing...
The right thing, guy,
and you know that.
Have you even talked to him
about it?
Fuck him.
Guy!
I can't. I'm not talking--
you are better than this.
You will not deny her this
experience.
Ben, you got a sec?
 Ben
 what's up?
Look, the board's not going
to approve...
This acquisition
next week...
Unless we can prove we're
worth the risk. Okay?
The company's valuation needs
to be presented differently.
I'd like to use the computer
program you wrote.
Ben we need a team
to hack the market.
 It's a grey area.
 You should have legal look
 into it first.
It's gonna be different soon.
What do you think she'll say
when daddy saves the world?
She'll wonder why you didn't
come home for dinner.
 Announcer
 all non-military...
 Non-essential personnel
 please clear the premise.
 I repeat: All non-military,
 non-essential personnel...
 Please clear the premise.
And we have every market
running the diagnostic.
It needs to cycle through
a few simulations.
Looks like it's working.
I'm going to take a break
for a while.
Well, what does that mean?
But-- I mean, if it's
unresponsive...
Well, do we up the dosage?
I mean, what do we do?
Well, we'll talk about it
when we come in. Okay.
What's up?
Hi.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It sounded like it was
about creason.
It was.
And?
Are you asking?
'Cause if you're asking, you
need to say something like...
"Shannon, what's happening
with creason?"
Or "Shannon, will you
loop me in...
With what the doctors
are saying?"
So will you--
say, "can I help you?"
Okay. Yeah, I can.
Shannon, loop me in...
With what the doctors
are saying.
I want to help you.
It's fine. I can do it.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Guy was the first one to take
a chance on me.
All the boys on the floor used
to look at me...
Like I was such a tight ass.
And you know, he made a mistake,
but...
It was just a mistake.
I don't even like this stuff.
And I could be so much richer,
but I am not.
Well, I'm flat broke.
Sing that thing.
What thing?
That thing you sing.
No.
Sing it. Sing it.
It's late.
Be. Hit the note.
Be.
Be.
Be.
Go back to sleep.
How come the FBI hasn't just...
Back traced any short sales
to November 15th...
Because then you could just, you
know, you could trace it to...
Shit, the--
terrorists.
Yes.
Thank you.
The terrorists.
And then who knows?
Right, who knows?
You're more than just a patcher.
You know what I'm gonna do?
What?
I'm gonna pull a bin laden.
Oh, yeah, you remember that?
The family sold all their
stocks...
'Cause they knew the market was
gonna crash before 9/11.
So they short sold all their
united airlines stock...
The night before.
The night before.
They made a fortune.
It'd be the first time I ever
made money on a trade.
You know?
That's an insider trade, George.
'Cause you could just trace
it to them.
To the, um--
terrorists.
Yeah, to the terrorists.
Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry.
Nice chatting with you.
 Female agent
 Jimmy, front entrance clear?
 Do you copy?
I know, I said I'd just--
George took longer than usual
tonight, so.
Why would someone hack
the markets?
Oh, shit. Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Yeah? What?
Yeah.
I-- I know that, but I told
you that I'm working.
I don't know what day I get off.
What's going on?
God, you look like shit.
I took a little nap.
You gotta look at this.
Look at that.
Look, I had a late night
with Amelia.
What am I looking at?
Something big came up...
So to speak.
All right, George. Where're you
going with this, man?
Okay, okay... the markets
are the target, right?
Right.
So why wouldn't the terrorists
be playing the market?
Okay. So I traced all the short
sales from the 14th to the 16th.
You know, the usual suspects
came up.
You know, you got China.
You got Iran.
You got--
i got it.
You got-- okay,
and I got nothing.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I gotcha.
And then I traced all the
American companies...
And I got all these
portfolios...
Owned and operated
by the big boys.
Hey, look at this, look at this.
Take a look right there.
Jp Morgan, Wells Fargo,
assured technologies.
Is that b of a?
Mm-hm.
Commodities. All right, they all
look like normal trends, though.
Yeah, yeah, they're short...
But they're shorting everything
they can, you see that?
I know, I know, but they're
legit trading patterns.
You know, one bank starts,
they all--
yeah, yeah, but...
They're all following normal
trends.
Okay, so why isn't
Goldman sachs there?
Huh? Why isn't Goldman sachs
doing anything? Why?
The banks were all bailed
out by the fed...
In '08 after the crash.
But Goldman paid it back
April 14th, '09.
Okay?
The only company shorting on the
day of the cyber-attack...
Are the companies that
the fed bailed out...
And has total control over their
managing interests.
George, are you sure about this?
The fed doesn't have controlling
interest...
In Goldman sachs and it never
did.
Holy shit.
I swear to god.
The federal reserve is
orchestrating the largest...
Insider trade of all time.
 Del banco the
 banks work for the people...
 And I am here to insure
 the people...
 To continue their belief
 in the banks.
 I accept the president's
 nomination.
 I accept the post...
 As 16th chairman
 of the federal reserve.
Oh, I love it here, boys.
Money, power and the circus.
Always wanted to be the
ringleader.
And here I am... whoo!
Mr. del banco.
Yes.
We've spoken amongst
ourselves and...
We can't loan the people
any more money...
Without some incentives.
The bank needs incentive
to do their jobs?
In '08, you gave us
$800 billion.
Maybe we start there.
I'm gonna stop you right there,
bill. We've been cut off.
She ran her campaign
on accountability.
So no more blank checks
to the banks.
We are the five largest
investment banks...
In the western hemisphere.
The federal reserve was created
to serve our interests...
Not the current flavor
of the week.
Madame president will be--
to be fair...
Goldman sachs doesn't come to
these meetings anymore.
So I'm looking at four of the
five largest investment banks.
Richard, give us our money.
She wants to cut a check
to the people instead.
The people are too stupid
to know how to spend it.
Bill, we're on the same page.
I took an oath to protect the
financial system...
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
let the people control things.
Then what are we gonna do?
I've got a plan.
The fed tipped off the banks
two days before...
Even the FBI knew
about the threats.
They're the ones behind
the attack, man.
We lead the people to a point
of complete panic.
Then we rein it all back in.
This is where the markets will
be Monday morning...
Opening bell before the attack.
These are the markets at the end
of that day.
Your banks will sell your
assets...
A couple of days before the
attack, at the peak up here...
Then buy them back down here
for a fraction of the amount.
Next day, the market rebounds...
And all those stocks that you
bought for nothing are worth...
Well, billions.
We've never had a fed chairman
like you.
No, you haven't.
But this is all possible?
With the right man on the
inside, anything's possible.
We're being sabotaged, schwab.
We need to meet... now.
 Schwab what are
 you talking about, guy?
 I'm in D.C.
Yeah? Well, find a plane,
it's a 2-hour flight.
This is about so much more
than just money.
Now, we won't be able to catch
him in the act...
Without your help.
He will lie to you and tell you
it's all for some greater good.
Pilot big top on
final approach at 12,000 feet.
He will come to your house.
He will use you.
Use you.
To help him hijack the markets.
You don't want to be used again.
There's a hypothesis at best.
So what if Goldman isn't
shorting.
All that proves is they're
still the smartest.
Market cap is 18 trillion.
The banks are short 8 fucking
trillion.
Goldman hasn't made a move,
okay?
Help me out here.
Help you out. Christ.
We think--
this isn't exactly
the optimal time...
To play conspiracy theory,
by the way.
This isn't a theory.
This is a fact.
It's a fact?
Yeah!
This is them rewriting the
rules. Same as it ever was.
The housing collapse, student
loans, the great depression...
Iraq.
You and I both know the fed
is behind everything.
Ben, do the right thing.
You can't seriously be
thinking...
About keeping these markets
live tomorrow.
You gotta sort this out.
You gotta freeze everything.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody.
They're the most dangerous.
The most powerful.
Guy, who else knows about this?
No one.
What's this?
You want to stay a free man?
All we talked about here
is baseball.
What do you say?
 Operator
 white house operator.
Schwab yes, I need
Jeff on his secure line.
 This is Sarah schwab.
 Jeff
 hello?
Schwab I want you
to know I'll be handing in...
 My letter of resignation
 tomorrow morning.
 Jeff Sarah, what
 are you talking about?
 Schwab
 I'm sorry.
 This isn't what I signed
 up for.
 The system's entirely fucked.
Is it okay if we talk
for a minute?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Just say it.
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow.
Something-- there's something
i need--
when we started dating,
you told me how...
Complicated things might become.
I only came back to do this
because of you.
But I don't know if those were
the right reasons.
What?
What are you doing?
It's 4:00 A.M.
I never wanted to be a cheater.
I know.
Just never enough. I wanted
more, I needed more and more.
You know how I would always
say...
I'm doing this for you and for
creason to make you happy...
Make you comfortable?
I couldn't stop, Shannon,
i couldn't stop.
I'm afraid.
I'm scared.
I'm fucking scared and I don't
know what's gonna happen.
I don't know what's gonna
happen tomorrow.
Oh, would you knock it off!
No one knows what's gonna
happen tomorrow.
I don't know what's gonna
happen tomorrow.
You made a mistake, you fix it.
It's what you're gonna do
tomorrow. You're gonna fix it.
This is different.
Oh.
This is different.
It's not different!
It's not different!
It's not!
You always say it's different.
It's not different.
It's the same thing.
When you started your business.
When you hijacked the market.
When you got caught.
It's not the-- we're all
still here!
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Mom threw a book at me.
Yeah, just a paperback.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Okay.
You okay?
He broke up with me.
Nah.
You know-- okay?
He broke up with me.
Okay, okay, okay.
Daddy-- no, no.
Okay, okay. It's okay, baby.
Oh, sweetie pie.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Fucking Ben.
He's such an asshole!
The guy's a...
Yes, he's a-- he's an asshole.
It's just a boy, sweetie pie.
It's just a boy.
It's okay.
But I loved him.
No, no, you love me.
You love your daddy.
Okay.
Honey bunny.
Yes.
He's a moron.
Lots of boys.
They're afraid, George.
They're afraid of what might
happen if they lose the system.
So what are we gonna do?
We're gonna get through this.
Are we?
You boys ready to save
the fucking world?
We can only hope.
It's an angry day.
I like it.
We're gonna get through this.
 Announcer
 the president landed here...
 In charm city and headed
 straight...
 To wallner park elementary
 school.
It's the president's first stop
here in Baltimore...
 Where we have Shane mandes
 standing by live.
Shane Jessica,
we're just down the driveway...
 From wallner park elementary
 school.
It's the first stop on the
president's visit to Baltimore.
And the fox went hop, hop,
hop through the garden...
Across the riverbed,
into the large hedge...
Where he found a most
mysterious object.
Now this object wasn't anything
the fox could describe...
With his little fox voice.
Good morning, everyone.
Mr. grillstein, these are your
headphones to listen...
In on the chatter
at the Clifton house.
And I'll be monitoring all the
markets right here.
Thank you very much.
Sarah resigned this morning.
Why? Why is that?
She said the system is fucked.
She sounded frightened.
Then she just hung up.
Well, I told you she
wasn't cut out for this.
This better work.
I've got cnbc reporting
on a merger out of London.
I have a feeling we'll be
running hot...
With that European server.
Announcer opening bell
is sponsored by muller yogurt.
Good morning, America.
Moments away.
Okay.
Morning.
Hey.
Hey, hey, don't forget
your vitamins, yeah?
Got them.
Babe, I'm sorry about the boy.
Yeah, I don't want to talk
about it.
Okay.
Have a good day.
Yeah.
Big day.
Hey, mom.
Yeah?
He's got it.
Really?
Yeah, he's got it.
He's got it.
Can I help you, Ben?
Why am I getting a lag
on bloomberg?
Good luck.
Don't need luck.
We're running way too
many markets.
I'm pushing these to one.
Do you want the nuts?
Unh-unh.
Why not? Just try a little.
They're--
it's time.
Okay, let's initiate the backend
pairing sequence, George.
What do you need?
Look for the authorization code.
4-8-2-0-c-b.
Mm-hm.
New York's up.
 Reporter we have
 the dow industrial up 89.
 Nasdaq up 61.
 S&p is up 18.
 Gold contract's down $7.03.
Ben, give me Miami.
 Reporter
 crude up $3.14.
 Bonds down slightly lower
 than Friday's closing.
 10-year and 30-year both
 down...
And go Chicago.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live... yup.
Reporter #2 it almost
feels like when you read...
 The dow, it does seem
 like a sports story.
 Stocks crashing and then
 suddenly...
 Just when you think it'll
 never recover...
 Boom, we're back in play.
We're live.
We're tracking option
contracts.
Yeah.
Asks all maps the bids.
It is working.
It's really working.
Hah-hah-hah!
Del banco this is about
so much more than just money.
 Guy
 do the right thing, Ben.
Okay, we're done here.
Come on.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
What's the static?
I don't know.
What's the static?
What's the static?
I don't fucking know, guy.
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me a second.
What the hell is that?
Is that your computer
or the server?
Goddamn second.
What is this static?
George, are you getting this!
Unplug everything.
Unplug it. Unplug it.
Pull it off-line.
Unplug it?
This isn't gonna fix it.
Ben, shut it down!
Ben, pull it off-line!
It's right here.
Sector 2, sector 5, 6.
Come on, woman, come on!
The screens are all flashing
static.
Shit, I don't know what's
going on.
George, shut it. Shut it down.
I can't. It's nuclear.
Oh, what the hell's going on?
George, I'm pulling drives.
Pull all the peripheral
drives first.
Ben!
And then work your way inward,
do you hear me?
- Shut it!
- It's too late.
We're crashing. Shut down!
Shut it down!
It's too late.
It's not! Shut it down!
It's already in the system.
What? What?
It's already in the system.
It's gonna hit the markets...
It's not.
...in 30 seconds, I didn't know
until I saw the code.
What is this?
What the fuck is this?
I shut you down, so that you
couldn't do it again...
So that you couldn't hack
the markets again.
What the fuck is this?
They told me you were gonna
hijack the...
Ben!
How was I supposed to believe
you? Believe any of this?
You told me I was like family
and then you lied to me.
Why did you do this to me?
You did--
haven't you ever wanted
to make an impact?
Do you know, I mean really
be somebody?
This is not just about money.
This is about so much more
than just money.
Who told you? Ben, look at me.
Who told you?
Who told you these things?
Del banco!
You have no f-- no fucking idea
what you just did.
Ben... you killed us.
You fucking killed us.
 Anchor
 just receiving word...
The Chicago mercantile exchange
has fallen victim...
 To a cyber attack.
This... this is the virus.
 A cyber attack.
 Cyber attack.
Interest rates
must remain low...
Loans approved, money flowing...
Because we are doing this
for the good of the people.
I need your word.
Sure.
We just lost New York.
Chicago's been hit.
Sir, I have guy Clifton
on the phone.
Guy. Guy!
We're under attack.
What did you do?
This is not me. The feds hacked
the system. Do you hear me?
What are you talking about?
 You find del banco
 and you ask him.
You talk to him. Find del banco.
We're trying to figure this out.
I need George to reroute.
The markets have been attacked,
madame president.
All right. Excuse me,
children. Which markets?
All of them, ma'am.
 Market reporter
 just receiving word...
 From inside the
 New York stock exchange...
 That all the screens are
 flashing a symbol.
 And nobody knows what
 to make of it.
The market is literally frozen.
Now we assume--
sorry.
Jeez, dude.
Hey, what are you doing?
Shit.
We'll meet you back at home.
Good. Yeah.
Okay, good.
Excuse me. Yes, I need Jeff
on his secure line.
Now, from these numbers here
that are coming in...
It looks like, madame president,
people are beginning...
To withdraw their money
from the banks.
Okay.
The market already is going
to take a major dip.
We don't want the banks
to suffer...
Any more than they have to.
Reporter
we're now receiving isolated...
 Reports that people are
 withdrawing large quantities
 of money from atms.
 Some even closing out--
 the government won't address
 fdic coverage rumors...
 Because they're saying
 it's not necessary.
 Everything's fine.
 We're on track.
 Maybe somebody over
 at the white house...
 Should watch the news.
Hey, Jeff, you need to brief
her.
 Jeff
 yeah, it's a little late.
 Del banco's got her ear.
Listen, it's all happening,
just like I predicted.
 Del banco's lobbying
 for the banks to go dark...
 Put a freeze on everything.
Jeff.
Gotta go.
Jeff and I both agree.
I'll recommend the president
put a freeze...
On all banking activities.
Why?
Because your banks only hold 10%
cash deposit at any given time.
That'll run out in a matter
of hours.
You want the focus to be
on the markets...
Not on bank vaults.
Hey, chelsh, I still need the
depletion numbers...
From Goldman, I don't have
those yet.
Chelsh they won't
give me the numbers, Sarah.
I'm the fucking treasury office.
What do you mean they won't--
chelsh you're not
the treasury office anymore.
All right, look, call me back
in five. I gotta get this.
Erin, what do you got?
Erin
it's about the European union.
What?
 Erin
 they're freezing us out.
Reporter I'm standing
outside parliament now...
Where the prime minister has
called an emergency session...
 To discuss the financial
 implications to--
reporter #2 large
quantities of money from atms.
 Some even closing out their
 entire account...
 Fearing life savings could
 be plundered.
Flashing red.
We're flashing red!
No, no, we need to reloop the
nasdaq server...
Through yellow before
you can boot.
Yeah?
Guy, listen to me.
I fucking told you, schwab.
Guy, listen!
What?
They're running the banks, guy.
It wasn't supposed to happen
this fast.
It started here, then London,
then Hong Kong.
They're running our banks
from every city in the world.
It's like fucking dominoes.
Are you close?
Please tell me you're close.
Guy?
Am I close to what?
Okay, if you could pull the
markets back online...
We can-- we can call it a market
glitch or an algorithm failure.
We can calm everybody down.
You want me to save the banks,
schwab?
I'm not asking you to save
the banks, guy.
I'm asking you to restore
some faith in the system.
Okay, good, good. Trace the
origin with this code; 0010010.
I know what's at stake
and we're working on it.
I'm going to have to get
back to you.
Well, come-- guy! Guy!
 Reporter we've just
 learned that all us banks...
 Have been ordered closed
 until further notice.
This is bullshit. I
can't even get on the website.
They can do anything,
like most politicians.
They believe they can just
order it--
I watched the bank
teller lock the front doors.
It was locked. The bank doesn't
close 'til 5:00.
You're not letting
us close our accounts?
They kicked us all out.
Why won't they let us close
our own account? Is there a law?
Can you show me the law?
I'm going to need this room.
Thank you.
I'll be right outside,
madame president.
Madame president.
I'm a customer. I'm a customer.
You're outside with everybody--
she's-- whoa!
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
Oh, my god!
No one really saw this coming.
Wait a second. I'm
tracking this crash just fine.
Leading the people into panic.
What I'm not tracking, in order
to get these short sales...
To work, we've got to get the
market back up and functioning.
Right. We pull them
back up online.
How do you get the markets
back up online?
Oh, I don't... guy Clifton does.
I just-- I need to know
if it's possible for us...
To override this thing and bring
the markets back on-line.
We slow it all down.
Yeah, it's possible...
But what next?
That's the million dollar
question.
Sinclair
I don't know why they'd warn...
 The rich stock brokers...
 But they said that they've
 already hacked...
 The New York stock exchange
 backup.
The government
will call guy Clifton.
And the only reason they know
about guy Clifton's skill set...
Is because... I conveniently
recommended his indictment.
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.
He'll play the markets
just like us.
Come on, help me fix this.
What's in it for me?
But he's also facing jail time,
thanks to yours truly.
I'm gonna need immunity.
So they'll offer him immunity...
To stop an inevitable terror
attack.
It's risky... but they won't
have any choice.
We'll make sure of that.
These cyber threats have no
lasting implications...
On any market ever.
Ben, do the right thing.
The virus I give Ben
isn't unbreakable.
It'll take some
hours, but they'll crack it.
No matter what happens...
Even if Clifton figures the
whole thing out...
He'll still pull the markets
back up online...
Because if he doesn't...
He'll lose all his money,
just like us.
So you're betting our banks
on one man's greed?
Absolutely.
 Man the cabinet
 and the federal reserve...
Are meeting behind closed doors
at the moment...
 Discussing next steps while
 they desperately...
Try to keep the economy alive.
 They know how much money
 they need...
 But they don't know how
 they're going to get it.
Crazy virus del banco gave you.
I didn't know I was
planting a virus.
This isn't your fault, son.
You were trying to do
the right thing.
I didn't let you trust me
enough, Ben.
I hear you broke up
with creason.
I was under the impression you
were trying to hijack--
do you have any idea what that
does to a girl like her?
She doesn't give a shit
about any of this, Ben.
You know that.
Any way to make this right?
This was gonna happen sooner
or later, not this soon.
Not this soon.
I didn't want creason
to have to choose sides...
After all this went down.
You'll always be her father.
Backend server code confirmed.
 We have a double-enter enable
 key on my mark.
 3... 2, 1.
I need your word, interest rates
must remain low...
Loans approved, money flowing...
Because we are doing this
for the good of the people...
Because it's the right thing
to do.
Hello?
 Schwab
 guy.
Hey! Free money!
Get the fuck out of here!
 Schwab
 hello?
 Hello?
 You know, schwab...
You're not gonna convince me...
That the system's just gonna
fix itself again.
 Guy
 the banks and the fed...
Where did that money come from,
schwab?
 Hm? Whose money is that?
We the people shouldn't be made
up of you or me...
 Or the bankers that fucking
 control us!
 And don't tell me that
 I'm wrong.
 Because up until today,
 I was one of those guys.
 Taking people's money and
 manipulating the system.
 I've owned that.
I've owned it.
The system... does not work.
 Your money is not safe
 in the banks.
 Don't keep more than
 what you need.
 If the banks get in trouble,
 they will take your money.
 The government will take
 your money.
We made realistic rules so that
it could never happen again.
 We do not have jurisdiction
 to directly go out...
 And audit reserve bank
 activities.
Mr. del banco.
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you meet here?
Why are we at the circus?
This is where the stock market
was created.
Come here.
Now there are several theories,
of course...
But this is the one
i subscribe to.
It was a hot summer day
in 1792...
And four men sitting right
over there, created--
they created a market place...
Whereby people like you and I...
Could bet on a working-class
America...
Through stocks and bonds.
It was the greatest game
ever invented.
That's what they called it.
And there were two clowns,
performing an operatic...
While they were being chased
by a bear.
Right there.
And it was the clowns
that gave them the idea.
But the clowns had to outrun
the bear.
Well, he didn't have to outrun
the bear...
He just had to outrun
the other guy.
Cheers to the American dream.
Guy you have got to tell
the people the truth, schwab.
 You got to tell the truth.
You got to do the right thing.
 Letting the banks get away
 with this...
It's just not the right thing.
 You know why?
 Because our kids still need
 to live in this world.
 Do you understand?
 It's up to you.
I really wish I could help
you with this. I do.
And I wish I could help you
save the world...
But I'm late for dinner.
