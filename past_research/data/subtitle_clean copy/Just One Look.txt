''I've already mastered
the 4th Buddha's Palm stance.
I miss Sister and Brother Kim Fei
Take me to them!
Silly girl!
You'll run into your father
If you go look for them.''
I'm going, kiddo.
-Take care, Master.
-Thanks.
Still watching TV, you silly girl?
Your master's leaving!
Master. Is ''Buddha's Palm'' real?
It's just a movie, silly girl.
How can it be real?
Master...
When will you take me
off this mountain?
When you're all grown up!
I'll have taken you off
this mountain by then.
''999--WHO'S THE MURDERER?''
Come on in! Place your bets!
Uncle Fat! Good luck!
-Cho Tat-wah!
-Dad!
Well? Lost again?
You already owe us
a fortune.
This is not good.
I don't care. You have to
pay us back no matter what.
Otherwise...
You'll die for sure, asshole!
Dad, the movie is starting!
Hurry! Hurry!
Your wife can be a hooker
and you still can't pay!
Brother!
Don't worry, Yin.
Freeze! There are guns
aimed at you everywhere.
They're holding Ka Leung hostage
and they want me to open the safe.
Let's go and rescue him,
brother!
It's just a life for a life.
Is there enough time?
It's already 10:50.
Last night, there was someone here,
wearing a white trenchcoat.
He went in, and then he left.
But no one came and went
all day today.
That's odd.
Someone shot himself
in the toilet!!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!!
Dad...
Dad...
Dad!
Dad, is that you?
You came back as a frog so soon?
I'll take you home.
Mom! Mom!!
Mom, Dad was killed by ''Crazy'',
the guy who runs the gambling place.
I heard him telling Dad
the other day,
''I don't care. You have to
pay us back no matter what.''
And he Also said,
''You'll die for sure''!
It's true!
Dad was a cop.
He wouldn't kill himself!
He wouldn't!!
Mom! Mom!!
Actually, Dad didn't die.
He only turned into a frog.
See? it's really him!
Be good and listen
to Grandma, understand?
Such a big frog
hopping around!
And I just bought this
new pair of shoes today!
What's wrong, Boss?
Somebody hit me! Dammit!
Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding??
Goddamn it!
Don't let me catch you or
I'll cut your balls off!
But no one came and went
all day today.
That's odd.
You think of a way to look inside
and see what's going on.
Brother!
Don't worry, Yin.
Freeze! There are guns aimed
at you everywhere!
They're holding Ka Leung hostage
and they want me to open the safe.
Why did you kill my master??
Why did you kill my master??
Why did you kill my master??
Sweet Sugar Cane!
Come and get it! Crisp and sweet!
Come and get it! Big and tasty!
Cut it out, you brat!
You're wasting it!
They're plump, but cute!
Nice fishballs!
You know what to do, madam!
Good business, granny!
Let me get a cane!
Hands off! I get first pick!
-Here you are.
-Thank you.
-The canes look good!
-Help yourself.
Each of you, take one.
What? You don't know me?
Quit staring, sugar cane kid!
Your dad still owes me money,
you know!
Keep staring and I'll
break you in half,
just like a sugar cane.
You should take him
to see a doctor!
Bye now. Have some more.
-Where are you going now?
-Hey! Come back and help me!
''We are the Jin Wu School!
We are the best!
We will fight ourselves
to fame and glory!
We fight for compassion
and honor!
But our master was murdered.
We must have revenge!''
Fantastic!
It's really big!
Bigger than your mom's!
If we could just see the girl
and see her taking it in
with her own fair hands,
that would be great!
Let's wait a while then.
Let's go! She could be an old hag!
Let's go!
I say we stone it to death!
I say we bury it alive.
That's more fun!
No, let's do this.
Let's drown it and see
how long it can last.
How about...
Death by electrocution?
You're weird!
How come there's nothing?
Why's that?
You need water!
Let's get some then!
We can just pee on it!
Come on!
I'm in deep shit!
I can't feel my little brother!
What?
You little brother is right there!
No that one! THIs one!
You're kidding!
How dare you play
on our turf, kid?
Don't you know who we are?
Which gang do you belong to?
Well?
Then we have to give
all of you a beating!
What do you say? Who says
this is your turf?
I'll take you! One on one!
Motherfucker!
See how cocky he is?
Let's cut the bullshit
and kill him first!
Why are you in
such a fucking rush?
Let me find out who he is first,
then I'll kick his ass!
Kid, you better not fuck with me.
Tell me which gang you belong to
or I'll fuck you up!
So you want to fight me, huh?
Get me my knife!
Yes, Boss!
Here, Boss!
It's a fake! Get them!
''Everybody worships him!
He's most powerful!
He beats up the bad guys
until they plea for mercy!
Ma Wing Ching and Chen Jun
are our heroes!
Chen Jun can fight with his
mysterious ''Mi Chung Fist''!
It's Ma Wing Ching against
the Jin Wu School!''
''THE BOXER FROM SHANTUNG''
Showtime!
Watch the stall.
I have to go get some more cane.
Hey. Have you seen it yet?
Of course not!
Grandma wouldn't let me go out!
You're missing out!
Don't you know?
Mario Milano is in it!
He has a fight with Ma Wing Jing.
It's awesome!
Really?
Milano uses his Cobra Lock on Ma!
Ma turns around and uses
his ''Tiger's Tail Kick''!
So who wins?
Ma Wing Jing, of course!
Watch the stall, mom!
You brat! Come back here, now!
See that girl? She's gorgeous!
Yeah, just like the heroine
in ''A Touch Of Zen''!
Did you see that? She smiled at me!
She was looking at me, silly!
She looked this way!
Look over there!
YOU look over there!
Greetings, everyone!
I'm delighted
to demonstrate for you
my Twin Butterfly Knives stances!
But before I do, my daughter would
like to give you something.
Please come and visit my school.
I guarantee that you'll be
heaIthier and more fit!
Come and visit us.
Your drumming was great!
-Come and visit us.
-Sure.
It's the Hung Gar Fist!
Your horse stance has to be lower!
Harder!
Where's your strength?
Harder!
Hey, it's here!
''Gok's Martial Arts School''
Come on!
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes!
You might as well learn something!
Hey! Wai!
Where did you learn that move?
From watching ''The Boxer
From Shantung'', Master.
Always watching Kung Fu films!
It's all fake! They don't know
how to fight!
They fight and fight,
but no one dies!
That actor, Chen Kuan Tai?
He practices cuIt stances!
He knows nothing about
Hung Gar Fist!
Now go to the corner and
practice your horse stance!
-Dad.
-What?
We have new students.
What do you want to learn?
The Butterfly Knives.
Why?
For rev -
To protect the country,
strengthen my body,
and to glorify our
Chinese Martial Arts!
At least you have some ambition.
And you?
I want to learn drumming!
Drumming?
Yes, I want to learn this beautiful
tradition of Cheung Chau Island
so that we will become
famous throughout Asia,
Africa, and even Europe!
Then do you know the rules of
learning kung fu here?
Read them out aloud!
One, respect our Master.
Two, protect our country.
Three, help the weak.
Four, always help others.
Five, pay tuition on time.
Good!
Get the Butterfly Knives, honey.
Here, Dad.
These knives have a long history.
I inherited them from my Master.
They are the symbol of our school.
I'll tell you their
glorious history later.
I'll just let you hold them today.
I want you two to really
learn your crafts here.
Honey, fill out the registration
forms for them.
So you're Master Gok's daughter!
What's your name?
I'm Nam.
How old are you?
I just want to know whether
you're older than me.
If you are, then I'll
call you Big Sister.
If you aren't, then I'll
call you Little Sister.
Just call me Nam.
Nam? I'm Ming.
Everyone calls me
''Fishball Ming''.
He is Fan.
How many days do you plan
to attend each week?
Two.
Only two days?
You won't learn much with
two lessons a week.
I'll make it five a week.
But two is fine for learning drums.
No! I'll learn kung fu too!
Five days for me too!
She didn't ask you to learn kung fu!
I want to keep you company!
I don't need your company!
What about your sugar cane job?
Oh no!
I must have hurt it when we
electrocuted that rat!
What?
I was this close to ''Chivalrous Lady''.
But I wasn't even aroused!
I must have killed all the nerves!
Really? That can be serious!
Of course it is!
I can't make it go bigger!
What if l become...impotent?
All right.
Go and catch the aduIt show
tomorrow morning.
I guarantee you'll be
fine afterwards.
Really?
Trust me.
So whenever you're near girIs,
you'll go like this?
Why? Don't you?
''THE VlRGlN FLOWER BLOOMS''
Well? Could you?
Give me a cane.
See! Of course l still could!
See? I told you!
That was a great idea!
Good business, boss!
Good business, granny!
Thanks.
What's with you??
All those fancy movements!
What a waste of time!
It's just an Unicorn Dance!
Watch me!
Look. Just wave it like this!
Idiot!
Start the cymbaIs!
Good business!
Good business, granny!
-This is for you.
-Thanks.
Have a sugar cane.
What's your problem,
sugar cane boy?
Always giving me that stare!
Come to the Temple tonight,
If you dare.
Normally, I would go
all the way down.
But since I've split my pants,
I'll just go halfway.
Whoever wins tonight
will work for me.
Whoever loses will have to
fix my pants.
Let me make it clear.
It'll be a no-holds-barred match.
-Curly!
-Here.
What's your stance again?
The Mantis Fist!
-Sounds good. Let's see it.
-Yes.
Good, good.
-Baldy!
-Here!
What's your style?
The Nine Pa Mei Pushes.
Sounds good. Let's see it.
Good, good.
We'll have a ''Mantis Fist vs
The Nine Pa Mei Pushes'' tonight.
Begin! We'll watch it from up there.
What the fuck are you two doing?
Just fight!
What the hell was that??
Choy Li Fut style?
Use your Mantis Fist and
your Nine Pa Mei Pushes!
Where are your styles now?
Clobber him!
Arm lock!
Hit his head...
Are you all right, Boss?
-Again??
-Oh no!
It's not bleeding! It's not bleeding!
Motherfucker!
Come down here and
fight me if you dare!
Hiding like a goddamn turtle!
Fuck you! Go to Hell!
Don't let me catch you or
I'll cut your balls off!
You're all fucking useless!
It's been more than 10 years now
and you still can't find him!
Do you want him to
crack my head open?
Bastards! All you know is
eating and shitting!
Keep fighting!
That's weird!
Yup. She just disappeared.
You should come with me tonight.
What are you doing?
Can't you see? I'm practicing the
''Golden Fire Eyes'' magic!
Don't worry. Once I master it,
I'll be able to spot
all ghosts and demons!
-''JAMES BOND in LlVE AND LET DIE''
-Are you for real?
Is this the right way?
Yes. Come on!
What is this place?
It should be here.
This is getting scary!
Who cares? Come on!
Who would live here?
Fan, what is this place?
Are you sure you're
on the right path?
No one would live here!
I told Mom I'd be
home for dinner!
Let's go. We'll come
another time.
Hey! Are you all right?
She has to be a ghost!
No way.
Think about it. Why would
a pretty girl like that
live in the woods?
Also, when I fell last night...
Do you know what I saw?
What?
An abandoned graveyard!
The coffins are covered with weeds.
Some of them were even half opened!
I was about to look closer
when I saw a long-haired girl
in white.
She floated towards me.
Then, with a puff of smoke,
she turned into a fox,
and she entered one of the coffins!
I almost pooped in my pants!
Yeah right, and Wu Kum played
the fox!
Try to kid me, huh?
And blocked me?
Let's go see Master tonight
so he can fix your arm.
You should ask him to fix your nose!
You just want to see ''Chivalrous Lady''.
She wouldn't talk to you!
Just go and let him take a look!
Otherwise you'll become a cripple!
Your nose will rot!
Your arm will fall off!
Your face will have scars!
You won't be able to peeI canes!
No squeezing fishballs for you!
You two monkeys! You've been watching
too many Kung Fu films!
You think you're Kung Fu stars now?
Here, Dad.
Starting fights all the time!
You think you can fight? Just because
you know a few moves
doesn't mean you can!
Let me tell you.
Those Kung Fu films?
They are all fake!
No way, Master.
Of course!
Who's that director?
Chang Cheh!
In all of his films,
they all fight with
their guts all falling out!
Cut off someone's arm and he
becomes the ''One Armed Swordsman''!
Their guts are all spilled out,
but they just hold them in
and keep on fighting!
Isn't that ridiculous?
Then there's the worst of the lot!
Starring Ti Lung and David Chiang...
What's it called? ''Ven...''
''Vengeance''
Right! ''Vengeance''!
All it talks about is revenge!
What a bad model for kids!
And Chang Cheh even won
Best Director for it!
All of you monkeys like to
watch those films.
How can you not turn bad?
Wrap his arm.
I'll come back and tell you the
history of the Butterfly Knives.
Does it hurt?
A little.
I want some too!
How? You've got too many cuts.
Then...you can at least rub on it!
Later.
I inherited this pair of Butterfly Knives
from my Master.
Back then, during a
martial arts tournament,
my Master used it against the
Master of the 9-ringed Sword.
However...
At the tournament, my Master...
My Master lost.
The 9-ringed Sword
became more popular.
My Master feIt very guiIty.
He knew it wasn't the
Butterfly Knives,
it was because of his own
imperfect skills that failed them.
Therefore, my Master decided to
make these two Butterfly Knives
the heirloom of our school.
It is to remind us
that we should never assume
that we're the best!
Do you understand?
Yes!
Keep practicing!
995, 996, 997...
998, 999, 1000.
-Your turn!
-Why?
Why? You think I'm a retard?
A little kid like him
can't kick that hard!
You must have kicked it! Come on!
Thanks.
''NOW SHOWlNG''
''ClNDERELLA''
Sugar canes! Sweet and crisp!
It's you?!
Were you fighting again?
-I'll help you.
-No need!
You're looking for me?
Have some fishballs!
Dad told me to come and
collect your fees.
You're way overdue.
That's all?
I only have small change.
Do you mind?
Hey!
I didn't mean to peek at you
the other night.
But I was lost, so...
And I saw your house.
There was light upstairs,
so I climbed up the tree to see
if somebody's there.
That's when I saw you.
But I didn't see anything!
Really! I swear I didn't
see anything!
You're not a ghost, right?
You live with them?
You live in a nunnery?
Yes. So?
Then...What's your name?
Why should I tell you?
If you won't tell me, then...
I'll come back tonight
and ask you again.
I dare you!
You just wait and see.
I'm the Decimator, how's that?
Decimator? I'm Fan.
You're a nuisance!
What's your phone number,
Decimator?
What now? I don't have a phone!
No phone? So how do I find you?
Why don't you give me your address?
I'll write you letters
and I'll deliver them myself!
Just mail it to the convenience store
down the hill.
Use your strength!
1 , 2, 3...
Hey, hey! Give me a hand.
Are you really going to write
to that ghost?
Just burn her some paper money
as offerings!
You won't even help me?
Fine. Give me back
my swimming pants!
Give it to me!
Thanks.
I'm done.
''I fell in love
the first time I saw you''
That's too direct, you jerk!
But you did! Just admit it!
Can it be something less direct
and more romantic?
Think!
''MELODY''
I've got it!
You read and I'll write.
''A young couple with a lack of
family warmth...''
Too fast!
Okay, slowly...
''A young couple...
How do you spell ''couple''?
Just look!
''MISS DEClMATOR. STORE BY THE HlLL,
LANTAU ISLAND''
Well?
''THE FRUIt Is SWELLlNG''
What do we write now?
How about this?
''When a peach swells,
it's sweet and juicy.
Every man who sees it
will be overcome with passion.
I've always longed for a peach.
I wonder if yours is swelling?''
-Juicy my ass!
-I'm just fantasizing!
Don't you want that yourself?
''GlRIfRlEND''
Here are the synopses of all the
movies we've shown.
Thanks, Uncle Kew.
-Take your time.
-Okay.
There are so many here!
These synopses will last us a lifetime!
Look at this!
Which one is this?
''999--WHO'S THE MURDERER''?
That's an old one!
It's been almost 10 years.
I think it starred Cho Tat-wah
and Lin Fung.
During its run, his dad...
My dad didn't kill himself!
He was murdered!
Why wouldn't any of you believe me??
Dinner at 7,
then I'll take you to see
something exciting at 10.
I'll pick you up at 7.
Where do you live?
That's it! Just attack his head!
Where are your strengths??
On the ground! Roll!
Sweep him over!
What're you afraid of? Just stab him!
Chop him up! Yes!
You're so violent!
We don't have to watch it!
You want some soda?
I'll buy you a soda.
No soda? We can go and
catch some crabs!
I'll call you!
And to think I bought a
new hat just for her!
Bastard! Not again?!
Don't just stand there!
Wait! Am I bleeding?
Go! Find him!
Fan?! What are you doing here?
So it was ''Crazy'' who killed your dad.
No wonder you hate his guts.
You believe me?
Of course!
You never joke around
about your dad!
Nobody likes that asshole ''Crazy''.
Everyone wants him dead!
As long as you believe me.
But...do you have any proof?
Of course! I saw him crush
my dad to death!
He crushed your dad?
You won't understand.
He killed my dad.
I must take revenge for him.
But you'll be in trouble
if you kill him.
You better think it over.
I'll break his head!
No one will know.
Let me do it then!
I hate him too!
-Really?
-Sure!
-Really?
-Give it to me!
Don't just stand there!
We're not catching birds here!
Point that flashlight around!
Look everywhere!
Why are you pointing it
at the Temple, asshole?
The rock came from there!
What's wrong, Boss?
It hurts!
This was even worse!!
What are you doing tonight?
I'm meeting up with Hou.
Hou?
Can you take me to see this movie?
Su...Sure. Let's go.
See? I told you this was
a good synopsis!
Mr. Kuen.
One cane, please.
Get it yourself!
Hey. Aren't you showing
''ROMEO AND JULlET''?
It ended yesterday.
Yesterday?
Holy shit. That's not good.
''At 1 1 :30 am, President Nixon and
his wife got off the plane.
The President examined the PLA
along with Premier Chou En-lai.''
You know what?
That was my very first movie.
We'll go see it when
they show it again.
Great! I love the actress.
Her name is Olivia Hussey.
Those pictures you sent me
were beautiful.
You like them?
I'll ask Uncle Kew for more
and send to you.
Okay. Don't forget!
You...why do you live in a nunnery?
My dad was very poor
when l was born.
Back then, a fortune-teller said
that my birth stars clashed with his,
so they sent me here.
Do you know this plant?
It's called ''Ghost Needles''.
Once fermented, you can use it
to cure arthritis.
And do you know this one?
No.
This is ''Chicken Droppings Vine''.
Perfect for making good preserves.
You're like a little old lady!
What?
I have some ointment.
No, thanks.
So you've always lived here?
Yes, my Master is very nice to me.
She takes care of me
and lets me study,
but she wouldn't let me
go out and play.
Do you have any friends?
Sure. You've seen them.
I have?
Then, will you become one of them?
A nun?
I don't know. Maybe.
Look!
I have to go back now.
Can you loan me your jacket?
Thank you for your birthday gift.
Birthday gift?
I don't know when my birthday is,
but...I like it to be today.
When can I see you again?
The day after tomorrow.
You changed your hair style today.
When can I see you again?
''FUNERAIs FOR JULY''
Fan, you're so compassionate!
And at such a young age!
My condolences, Auntie.
Are you coming to the burial too?
Two tickets. Seats K15 and K16.
We'll stuff this bean
into the rat's ass.
Then we'll let it go.
Once the bean expands,
it will block its asshole.
It can't shit, so it'll go crazy
due to constipation,
and end up biting
its family to death!
We can then collect the bodies!
Will it work? Who told you this?
My Grandma!
She says it's a long lost art!
You don't believe me? Try it!
Let's try it.
Hey you!
You guys fought with
our boys here last time!
And you.
My brother said you're the cockiest.
I'm the only one responsible
for what happened.
Leave my brothers out of it.
Good. You've got guts. Come on.
-Hey. Are you sure about this?
-Yes!
-Are you all right?
-Well? How are you?
Hey. Are you all right?
Got any cigarettes?
Are you sure you're all right?
-Hey. Where did the bean go?
-That's right.
Let's go.
Are you really okay?
What's wrong with your butt,
brother?
Are you sure?
First, watch my hands.
Then watch how my legs move.
Here we go.
''Snow covers the hilItop''!
''Rhino looks at the Moon''!
''Chain of sleeping dragons''!
Fishball Ming!
Come. Repeat my moves.
All right.
Ready? ''Snow covers the hilItop''!
''Rhino looks at the Moon''!
''Chain of sleeping dragons''!
Stop!
Stand right there.
What kind of a stance was that?
It looks more like Wing Chun
than Hung Gar!
Give me the knives.
You must've seen the film
''Hung Gar and Wing Chun''
and got your stances all screwed up!
I've told you! Those movies are
nothing but lies!
The Hung Gar and Wing Chun
styles are totally different,
not like in the movie!
They mixed them all up. It's a mess!
-Master.
-What?
That movie just opened yesterday
and you've already seen it?
What did you say?
How dare you interrupt me
while I'm talking?!
Where's your discipline?
Go over there and do the
horse stance for two hours!
From now on, if l find
anyone learning those
messed up kung fu moves
from the movies,
I'll break his legs!
Deep horse stance, all of you!
You can't leave until
you get it right!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I haven't shit for days!
I'm leaving early.
Is Ming okay?
He doesn't look good.
Is he sick?
Him?
Yes, he's sick.
But...
He'll feel better if you
ask him yourself.
Actually, I meant to ask you.
Why do you two want to
learn kung fu?
It's normal for boys to
want to learn kung fu.
Why do you ask?
Nothing.
You two don't look like
the kung fu type.
He wants to learn drumming,
and you the Butterfly Knives.
Then why do you learn kung fu?
You're a girl.
I don't know either.
My dad had always
wanted me to learn it.
He said he wants to glorify
the Chinese Martial Arts.
Your dad has been watching
too many movies.
He thinks you're the ''Chivalrous Lady''
from ''A TOUCH OF ZEN''.
My mom was a real
chivalrous lady.
Her rank is even higher
than my dad's.
Her grandfather was the founder
of Yang style Tai Chi.
My dad really loved my mom.
But she got ill and passed away
not long after I was born.
You're ranked pretty high then!
I sure am!
Hey.
Do you have a girIfriend?
It's gone.
Are...are you free tomorrow?
My God. How could this happen?
Step aside! Mind your own business!
Hou! What's going on?
Don't you know?
Ming went crazy at home
and started biting his whole family!
His brother called the cops.
They're taking him to the hospital now.
I'll be back, Grandma.
I bought two tickets for the 5:30 show.
''A TOUCH OF ZEN''
Ming!
Are you all right?
The doctor said I've got rabies.
I'll be staying here for a while.
We shouldn't play with rats anymore.
Rabies? That's it?
Why were you so worried just now?
Nothing.
And...don't tell Chivalrous Lady.
I'll write to her myself.
You get some rest.
I'm going now.
You know what?
I think I'm really in love
with Chivalrous Lady.
I used to get aroused
whenever l was near her.
But now I'm lying here,
and I get aroused just
thinking about her.
I wonder...is that love?
I guess.
But...try not to think too much.
It's not good for you.
Have you seen her lately?
Chivalrous Lady? No. No.
I'm going now. Don't think too much.
Why're you in such a hurry?
It's getting dark. I think...
I think she's about to come out.
You're going to look for
that ghost again?
Fate!
Fate indeed!
What are you doing here?
I want to see you.
You hurt your hand!
I will get you out of here.
Are you taking a shower, sister?
Yes!
''That light smile on your face
are you aware of its magic?
It stirs my lonely heart
and takes my spirits away
I am trapped. How can I be with you?
That light smile on your face
shines like a moon
I hope that we can
always be together
and share every second and minute
I wish we will always be
a pair of lovebirds
That light smile on your face
has already locked my heart
Dreams fill my heart and mind
as I think about you til dawn
That cute smile on your face
encompasses both sadness
and joy
But sometimes, love can turn to hate
and hearts can be broken
in an instant
The dream is now over,
and she's no longer here
That light smile on your face
has already locked my heart
Dreams fill my heart and mind
as I think about you til dawn
That cute smile on your face
encompasses both sadness
and joy...''
Boss! Is it a boy or a girl?
-Boy, boy!
-All right!
I'm fine!
Cheers!
God damn it!
''The dream is now over,
and she's no longer here''
You wrote all these letters?
All the stories sounded like
movie synopses.
Really?
Well, life is just like in the movies.
You copied them! Just admit it!
I don't care. As long as I can
convince you.
Did I say I am convinced?
I think they're disgusting.
But they're all from my heart!
Why are you holding a sword?
Your body is weak, so I wanted to
teach you the Tai Chi Sword style.
That's good. Hung Gar is
too difficuIt for me.
Tai Chi is much better!
Watch it! Or I'll chop your hand off!
You wouldn't!
I just got out of the hospital!
Don't wet your pants now.
Hey, Sugar Cane Boy!
Taking a piss?
Let me pull up your pants for you.
Let's go back to the movies.
What's that? What's that??
I'm asking you! What's that??
So you're the one who
shot me over the years!
You killed my dad! I must avenge him!
Are you nuts? I killed your dad?
I didn't kill him. He killed himself.
Everyone in Cheung Chau knows that!
He lost all his money gambling.
The cops were investigating him
and he had nowhere to go.
He killed himself out of fear,
you idiot!
Dad didn't kill himself!
He was murdered!
He was a highly decorated officer,
a good cop!
You killed him! Just admit it!
Listen, kid.
You think it's easy to kill someone?
Like it is in the movies?
I haven't even stepped on an ant!
I saw you crush a frog
with my own eyes!
When have I ever crushed a frog?
You've gone crazy from
thinking about your dad!
Fine.
Here's your chance.
Kill me, if you dare.
Come on! Kill me! Kill me!!
What?
One day, I will kill you!
What?
You just wait and see!
Kill me? You wouldn't have the guts!
My son is with me today.
Otherwise, I would've
cut your balls off!
I stepped on a frog 10 years ago
and he even remembers that?
Have you heard the news? Fan is going to
have a duel with Crazy!
What?? When?
In two nights, at the temple!
''TWIN DRAGONS''
Fan!
What's with him?
He's been punching the bag
ever since he got here.
He says he and Crazy are
going to have a duel.
-A duel?
-Yes!
You can punch a bag,
but can you beat him?
Think you'll win after
just a few lessons?
I don't want to win! I'm just
not afraid of him anymore!!
WE are afraid! You're going to die!
I can fight in your place!
I'm a better fighter!
Or we can ask Chivalrous Lady!
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Beat me. Then you can do
whatever you want.
I'm warning you!
Why did you hit him so hard?
He knows why.
He does? But I don't!
Don't call me ''Chivalrous Lady''
anymore.
Mr. Turtle. You're always
hiding in your shell.
Aren't you bored?
Have you been to Hong Kong?
Have you seen the outside world?
Bishop!
Mayor, I've heard that the kid
trains in Hung Gar.
His Master is Gok Bill!
He made this really vicious
looking lion head
at last year's Lion Dance!
So? Crazy studied Choy Li Fut!
He's much more experienced
than that kid!
But still!
''A blind fist can kill
the Old Master''
That's right! Haven't you heard?
''Youth exceIs at fists, and elder
exceIs in weapons''!
Oh, yeah?
What are the 5 best styles
of Southern Boxing?
There are 5??
Of course! I'll tell you!
They're Hung, Lau, Choy,
Lee, and Mok!
Have you heard of them?
So which is better?
Choy Li Fut or Hung Gar?
I'll tell you.
Hung Hei-kwun founded Hung Gar,
and Chan Heung founded Choy Li Fut.
Cut the bullshit!
So are you betting on
Crazy or the kid?
That's right!
Checkmate!
Master knows about us.
I may never see you again.
Will you take me away tonight?
I'll wait for you at the pier.
Don't forget.
Have some more.
Thanks.
You too.
Have some more.
I'm going, Grandma.
Take this. It's going
to rain tonight.
Come back soon. It's the Moon Festival.
You've got to win, Brother Fan.
Fan!
You won't lose with these.
Looks like Brother Crazy
won't be coming.
He probably doesn't want to
bully a kid.
Maybe he doesn't dare to come!
He's 20 years older!
It's going to be hard on him.
What's with Brother Crazy?
Is he drunk?
Maybe it's the
Drunken Sword Style!
Kick his ass!
Chop his head off!
Fight him, Fan!
What the hell was that?
-Doesn't he know how to fight?
-What's with Brother Crazy tonight?
-Maybe he hasn't eaten.
-He's totally not in his element!
-Brother Crazy!
-Brother Crazy!
-Are you all right?
-Hold on!
After him!
Come back!
Let him go.
I thought you wouldn't come!
It's okay now. Let's go.
Where are we going?
To Hong Kong.
Fan! Fan!
Fan!!
Crazy is still alive!
Crazy! He...
What?
Nothing. Go!
And don't come back!
Take care of my Grandma!
I will!
Hello?
Hello? Fan?
Can you come back this Saturday?
What is it? I'm busy here.
Why don't you come out here?
I'll tell you when you come back.
It's urgent. Just come back.
Fine. That's it then.
How did this happen?
He died of a brain tumor.
I thought I...
He lost to you on purpose
that night.
We heard that he couldn't bear
to leave his son behind.
He asked someone to tell me
before he died
that he really didn't kill your dad.
half.
half?
All right, half.
Son.
Here, son. Have a smoke.
I'll never be able to smoke with you.
Open your mouth.
What do you want to do
when you grow up?
I don't know.
Just don't be a nobody, like your dad.
Study hard.
Go to Hong Kong and
become an office clerk.
It's a good job.
It's classy, and it pays well.
People respect you in a suit.
Don't be a Cheung Chau gangster
for life.
Didn't we come here to play
the last time?
Yes, we came here to play last time.
But Daddy won't be able to do that
with you anymore.
Don't miss Daddy even if
Daddy is not here.
Nothing is too hard to handle.
You're a man. You can't do great things
if you're a sissy!
Hey. It's not your fault.
Your slingshots didn't cause his tumor.
I've held two tickets for you, Master Gok.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
-$7?
-Thanks.
Like this?
No, like this!
Bravo! That was good!
Do you know?
Hou went to Holland with his dad.
Really?
Now the Temple is all quiet.
Those gangsters all went to Hong Kong,
and they all became killers.
Remember Crazy's best fighter, Fo-tan?
I saw him in the news
the other day
when he was arrested.
Murder. He got almost 20 years.
How's your Chivalrous Lady?
She's doing good.
She wants to have a drink
with you sometime.
Also, she wants to apologize
for hurting you.
Stay and do the Lion Dance at the
Tin Hau Festival with me!
Didn't you like watching her drumming?
Well? What about that ghost of yours?
Her?
She left.
She left?
Why?
I don't know.
She took me to this
Buddhist Temple one day.
She said she wanted to pray for me.
But when I came out, she was gone.
So she Is a ghost after all!
After she left, I took her turtle back
to her old nunnery.
Perhaps...
She just wanted to fly away.
Fan, I'll come back for you!
I just want to see this world!
I will come back for you!
Hey! Have you had lunch yet?
