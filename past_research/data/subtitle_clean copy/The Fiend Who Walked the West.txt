want little truth out of you
there's a couple of things that are
bothering you said he
came straight the prison I was
just wondering how you knew where to
find me
and the other is why should a man who
doesn't stop moaning about his wife all
the why'd
 I could be
sad man
that could be that tell me how'd you
find out where I was me where
to look.
Emma's dead I got a first shot right
here you killed a man by the name of.
Prager I told you you were lying
hard to get around hemmond later
so he was who sent you probably
rigged up the whole jailbreak - I really
appreciate the trouble they went to
I suppose you I kid if I caught
on what you were doing I didn't have
to tell that I guess they didn't know
 though
choking me the way you did they
mentioned that - they know me better
than Papa has very funny sad man

and get in mile area Creek
she's a slow mover ain't she now sad man
tonight we're all going out to your

anything else you'd about
 because I wouldn't
 you're
white out of this
huh it wouldn't be
right side man but an IKE were all gonna
have some fun me and mrs. Hardy are

little hot lead first so you won't be so
active that's better
all right Little Miss May time up and
good now I'd turn around her I want
to she's doing.
Oh.
Now this edit I want you to study the
face of my clients very carefully can
you that the man sitting
there is capable of murder
Phoenix not only capable of murder
mr. Gage he's broken you mean you
believe he might have other murders to
his credit beside the one for which he
is now being tried I do I have here the
full of this homicidal
 it shows that he
spent a shocking ninety days in
prison for giving whiskey to an Indian
now I it let's say you now order
order
there will be no more mr. Gage there
is a time for rhetoric and a time for
cross-examination you will
confine yourself to the latter yes sir
 Alex will you tell me please why
this according to you most dangerous man
has never been tried for these other
murders you say we've
never been able to pin anything on it
until now I think
 be interested to find out
how this pinning was done let's all
understand mr. Hardy you testified that
the authorities engineered a prison
escape for you in order that you might
seek out Felix Griffin you've also
stated that posing as his friend you
 him an
admission of guilt the murder of one
more City am I right yes and what was
your reward to be 30 pieces of silver
 the other duty objection sustained
I'm sorry for jumping two obvious
conclusions your honor I should try to
phrase the question another way what
were you promised for this betrayal I
almost said betrayal for this service to
the law a pardon and if your mission
failed
they didn't say anything about failure
 a bartender fail
 is a fine thing I wish I
had more of Hardy however you
have said you were committed to prison
for the crime of armed robbery yes sir
 years 10 years a
very long term especially to a young man
who had heard prison doors clang shut on
what might have been wonderful days with
a beautiful wife and a dear little
daughter that I've been in your
shoes Hardy I should have prayed
every self confidence and of
self confidence so that I could without
care or consideration of any human
feeling with merciless lies found an
innocent man to the gallows of
reason than to be able to return to the
creature I had lost through my
own evil deed now mr. Griffin did you
ever see this before
that's amazing my housekeeper now you're
quite sure yes she wore a lot do you
know never
asked her but I remember her telling me
 time
 that's all
do you recognize this I said do you
recognize this ring you realize that
you're under oath and that any false
statement makes you guilty of perjury
will you please state your name again me.
 su-mei Mathewson em him take a
look at the inner band of this ring tell
me what you see
speak up so can hear you it's
 mmm you're sure mm thank you
well young lady this is your ring
it's the first time in human history
that Mathewson have you
an explanation for this discrepancy miss
Madison yes sir five years ago I was
 me this ring my
name was made fallkniven
the trial is over who told you about it
I wish you head
then you know everything
and did you know that I didn't mean the
things him that it was like
 I
did Dan oh now you are home and we
 11
the jury didn't convict Felix is free
too
you
what was it just an animal then you
can't leave this way I don't attend him
some more coffee just about the cup left
when are you going to decide what you
are do sir
why can't we what are we
waiting for
I want to see which way Griffin's gonna
jump but if we go away he won't bother
 huh how could he if
nobody knows where to anyway I
don't it would be as foolish as to
come back to town
he's come to town all right well
boys it's a bit of thought but we can't
break his neck just because he broke
hers you see he's got a perfect excuse
there's no point in killing it why not
she had as much to do with catching him
as I did more yeah but what she lied
about been married to this
 if she was lying
she saved Griffin's neck now don't ask
me why she did it
I will live long enough to figure some
women it and the way a jury looked at it
is that Mays horse probably shied away
from the
wagon broke her neck meanwhile Felix can
just come and pleases and I'm
afraid so Dan we haven't got anything on
him yeah well you think he might be kept
from coming and going can
get my wife and daughter away without
him known I reckon Sir Harry maybe you
could pick him up a question say
sometime around daylight no doesn't go
to and the way
 stand now Dan you make a mighty
 I tell you what I'm leaving
tomorrow with prison wagon report Smith
be kind to have some law-abiding
people no no
trouble will seem kind of funny
to you riding alongside the way and
instead of inter then I don't think so.
Anna I won't be going
we ought to thoughtful dan do you
want to make good campsite by nightfall
 there you go sweetie
now you mind your mommy huh right
Elena see how come you're taking the
wagon instead am it he didn't tell me

me with something please you

oh honey you'll come back here I
was not before I am now it's not
a way but why

 went riffin it find us he isn't gonna
give up until another
reason what I guess I guilty some.
Hobbit Griffin is still free to come and
go you'll kill other people be my
 quite smart
enough to stop unless I stop it you

out

you think I hold it against you if it
turning me in you got out of serving
 years and I got acquitted the only
ones I cut hurt maybe were a couple of.
