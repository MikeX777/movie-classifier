Hey, now, Joe, hurry
up and save that thing!
Now get in the car
before we all get killed!
I always try
to hold onto the feeling
I had when I was six.
How excited I was.
Did you see that thing?
Saved another turtle!
He doesn't care, Joe!
The kid has one
thing on his brain!
You know, Gator Land
could sure use my skills.
The turtle okay?
Hell's bells, Joe, just
drive, for God's sake.
There will be no Hoppy
if you do not sit down!
We will get to Old Time
Fun Town, all together!
Now, no amount
of turtles or armadillos
or any potential roadkill
could top what was to come.
Sit down right now, buckle up,
be quiet, or we are
turning this van around!
Oh, that's not me.
That's just some random kid
that has what I once had,
that oh-so-fantastic feeling
I'm still desperately
trying to hold onto.
Old Time Fun
Town is now open for business.
Freeze!
Yep, that's me.
Get down, get down!
Hell's bells, Joe!
 You're sure to
have a happy day
 At Old Time Fun Town
 So many things to see and do
 Yes, you want it
Ow, ow, okay, okay,
all right, okay.
Sit down!
Come on, let's go.
I have a long history
of humiliating myself
in front of other people.
There was that one time
in Mr. Cupper's class,
during a fascinating
science lesson,
where my habit of eating
breakfast burritos
finally caught up with me.
Knowing this was going
to be a thunderbolt
and I only had
seconds till ignition,
I quickly devised a plan
to brilliantly use today's
lesson of cause and effect.
I would simply drop
the book onto the floor
and time my release
perfectly with the loud bang.
Nice one, Pooter!
Well, you know what they say,
timing is everything.
So I really should start at
the beginning of this summer.
AA degree!
Yeah, we did it, Pooter!
It's Tucker.
I mean, you don't have to
keep calling me Pooter.
Hey, uh, Amber.
Congratulations.
Aw...
Thanks, Pooter.
Pooter!
What?
What?
You're a weird guy, Pooter.
Tucker, oh!
My little Tucker, oh,
come here, my baby boy.
Oh, we're so proud!
You'd think I'd
won the Nobel Peace Prize,
as far as my mom was concerned.
Oh, hi!
Here, here, take our picture!
One last little
embarrassment for the road,
topped off by the classic
Ostrowski family picture pose.
Smile!
Junior college was behind me,
and with a clean slate, I
was off to pursue my dream.
 The only way to get there
 Is to take that step
 To the other side of life
Yep, things were finally
gonna happen for me.
I got accepted into CalArts,
the school Walt
Disney himself built,
and the only place that
could nurture my love
of animation, theme
park design, and music.
Call me retro, but
I can't get enough
of groups like the
Who, the Moody Blues.
Just one little downside
to my whole plan...
My parents filed for personal
bankruptcy last week.
Gosh.
Hi, Tucker, dear, your
dad and I are heading
over to Pawn Road on 192.
Again?
Do you want to come?
Okay, well, we're just going
to need to borrow a few things.
Okay, get that, that
should cover the mortgage,
and that, the cash from that
might cover the power and food.
We need food.
Bye, dear!
Yeah, they have a great attitude
about the situation,
but it doesn't help
pay for CalArts.
Now, you'd think that working
for Disney or Universal
would be the natural
thing for me to do, right?
But my other little
downside was,
a few years back, I had
this great creative idea
to produce an
Ostrowski mega-mural.
But it kind of
pissed off the owner
of the movie theater,
who called the cops.
Looks like you're
going to jail, boy.
And these days, the big parks
do a little thing called
a background check.
Turn right.
Your other right.
Now, I only had another two months
before that got
wiped off my record,
thanks to a little
community service,
helping undo other people's art,
but that didn't
help me at the time.
I convinced myself, no
need to dwell on the past.
Time to get out
there, get a job,
and make some tuition money.
Hm.
Hm.
Uh, well,
cute.
But we're architects here,
and we just filled our
last summer intern slot.
Oh, thank you, Amber.
Amber Freeman?
Bye, Pooter.
Pontius, Ostroswki, Arnold.
This is a tough job.
It's gonna take
muscle and hard work.
I got room for two of you.
You don't have any
experience working
Asian fusion kitchen like this.
Thank you.
Perfect.
It was the job I'd
been looking for.
Why hadn't I thought of
this in the first place?
Working in a smaller theme park,
getting to know the business
that would be my life
without a pesky
background check.
It ain't Disney, but I was
willing to do anything.
Anything.
Your skins are over
in the character room.
Uh...
Okay, thank you so
much, Mr. Lloyd.
Uh, is there some kind of
orientation thing, or...
You're orientated.
You want the job or not?
Absolutely!
Uh, so just the
room right over...
Okay.
Yes, nailed the interview!
It was goodbye resume,
hello lifelong career.
As soon as I figured
out what a skin was.
Hoppy.
Oh, man, it is hot out there!
Yo, you mind unzipping me, bro?
Sure.
This was a moment in my life
that will forever be
burned into my senses.
Unzipping that costume was
like opening a pressure cooker.
When that steamed sweat hit me,
I think I blacked
out for a minute.
Oh, man, you're gonna get
used to that, don't worry.
It's good to meet you.
I'm Jerry, or as I'm
known around these parts,
Captain Jack's Parrot.
Captain Jack Sparrow?
Oh, no, no, no, man, what,
are you trying to get us sued?
It's Captain Jack's Parrot.
It's a new character.
I'm still working
on the name thing.
Oh, uh, hi, Tucker.
That Mr. Lloyd was worthless,
but Jerry, he
showed me the ropes.
Now Jerry got me started.
How to suit up.
How to move like the character.
The schedule.
Out for 30 minutes,
then back in to
rest for 30 minutes.
Now, sometimes, it's
easier to keep a costume on
for your break than to go
through the whole process
of putting on the feet,
putting on the gloves,
putting on the body.
No, no, no, dude, no, no.
Now, that's what
you do, all right?
Now this is what you don't do.
And I'm speaking
from experience.
Son of a!
Don't talk, it ruins
the illusion, man.
Don't pick up the kids.
They're slippery little suckers.
If some kid shakes your
hand and tries to break it,
do not squeeze back.
Nah, never mind.
Go ahead and bust
his little fingers.
And remember, it
may sound corny,
but most kids really
love the characters.
We mean something to 'em,
so try to make it special.
Jerry really knew his stuff.
Not that he'd worked
here very long.
This was just his second week,
but I guess he'd
been a school mascot,
the Fighting Aardvarks
or something like that.
And in two weeks, he'd learned
the Old Time Fun Town
characters' routine
enough to help me out.
Finally, it's your moment...
Wait just a second, wait.
How long do I stay in here?
30 minutes, bro.
Yeah, but how will I know
that my 30 minutes is up?
There's a watch taped
inside of the head.
What if I gotta sneeze?
Man, you can't, no
reaching up under the neck,
that just looks wrong.
So suck it up!
It's only 30 minutes!
You can do it!
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Man, get out there!
Okay, but doesn't somebody,
like, walk me around,
like an escort?
That's a good one.
This is Old Time Fun Town.
You're on your own.
Oh, my God.
I'm Hoppy.
See ya, Pooter.
Hoppy?
Hoppy the Kangaroo was there
in my hour of need.
Thanks, Hoppy, you're awesome!
And you're right, I
can be awesome too!
I'm Hoppy.
I'm Hoppy the Kangaroo.
I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy.
G'day, mate.
Hoppy the Kangaroo.
Hoppy the Kangaroo,
I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy.
You're Hoppy.
It was time for me
to meet the people.
I wasn't exactly sure
where I was supposed to go.
Stop talking, keep moving.
What?
It had only been two minutes?
28 more to go.
Hoppy!
Oh, how sweet!
Let's get our picture
taken with the bunny!
First lesson...
Kneel to the kid's level
or pay the consequences.
A kangaroo
should always watch his sack.
Ready, everybody, smile!
Okay, are you ready?
Say cheese!
Ready, smile!
Hoppy!
Hoppy!
Guys, look, it's a dog!
It's not a dog,
it has long ears.
Then it's gotta be
a rabbit, obviously,
just look at its long ears.
I know, I know what it is!
No, you don't!
Be quiet!
Dogs can have long ears.
It's gotta be a possum,
I mean, look at its pockets.
Dogs can have pockets?
Yes, any...
They'll argue over
anything, it doesn't matter.
It's ridiculous!
Can't you shut up already?
Enough, already!
Can't you tell it's an
armadillo, you morons?
Just take the picture!
Whatever!
Fine!
Smile!
Hoppy, can I have your autograph?
Okay, I told
MYSELF: I can do this.
Tucker?
Lots of lessons that first day.
Hoppy, Hoppy, come here.
I had been out for 45 minutes.
I had blown half of my break,
and I didn't know how
to get out of there.
All right,
everybody smile for the camera!
Hoppy!
Where'd he go?
Yo, it's noon, man.
Thanks for covering my shift.
Now, get back out there,
it's your turn again!
Yo, I'm just kidding.
But you gotta manage your
time, plan your escapes.
You're gonna die out there, man!
Yo, sports drinks will be
your friend, my brother.
Okay.
You gotta remember to
eat something, too, man.
I don't think I can.
Well, go ahead and hurl,
we got a whole department
here to take care of spew.
Yo, come back, guys, we got
a protein spill in progress.
Oh, man, they must
have the worst jobs.
Nope.
It is debatable that
most people think
that we actually have the
worst jobs in the park.
Yo, Kangaroo, meet Bear.
I'm Stu, I'm a
colorful polar bear.
Yo, say it right.
I'm Paws, the Pink Polar Bear!
Nice to meet you, uh, Tucker.
Or Hoppy?
How many of us are there?
Well, right now, there's
just the four of us.
It's me, you, Stu, and
Sam, who's off today.
Sam's actually
Bowser the Bulldog.
Uh, Bowser the Bulldog.
What's the, uh, what's
the pecking order?
Well, there's the
janitors, right, George?
My man!
Then there's us, the scum at
the bottom of the scum pit.
Then there's food service.
They're pretty low,
but they do get free food.
Then there's merchandise.
They won't speak
to you, by the way.
Yeah, in order to
work in merchandise,
You gotta have the three P's:
Pretty, pretty bored,
pretty pissy.
Then after that, it's the
one group I actually like...
The landscapers.
They not only
handle the greenery
but take care of the
petting zoo also.
Yo, and those guys,
they're crazy.
I think it's because
they grow their own.
Aw, man!
They look identical.
No, yes, maybe.
Poop roulette!
Poop candy, no, no.
Try it?
How about you?
No, I'm good, man.
Try it?
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Who's a good boy?
Uh oh.
So who's at the top
of the food chain?
Are you an animator?
Oh, no, I mean, kind of I am.
Uh, not, nobody
would pay for this,
but, I, uh,
you know, what I
really want to do?
What's that?
I want to be a
theme park designer.
You know, like design
lands and dark rides.
Nice, man.
Yeah, thank you, definitely.
Uh, so, uh,
so who's at the top
of the food chain?
The operations team runs this park,
Ops, they run the rides,
they set the schedule,
and report all activities
to the general manager.
They are total control freaks.
You got something to say, boys?
No, uh, no, we're
good, yeah, we're good.
Because you're stinking
up the break area.
Why don't you head back to
your sweaty little closet?
Yes, sir,
um, Richard.
Can we call you Dick?
Yo, those guys are dicks.
They're douchebags.
Yeah, but there's no
complaining about it,
'cause they're in
tight with the GM.
Don't piss off
the GM, he's Khan.
He's Vader.
No, he's like Darth Vader's
boss, um, you know, uh...
Palpatine.
Emperor Palpatine, yeah.
The general manager
of Old Time Fun Town
was Benjamin Fletcher.
Not so much the evil ruler
of the Galactic Empire,
but there was something about
this guy that seemed shady.
It may have been how he added
a Y to every employee's name.
Susy, Johnny, Sally, Annie,
Bobby, Scotty,
Georgie, pick that up.
But I'll give him one thing...
He knew everyone's name.
I mean, everyone's name.
That is impressive.
Creepy, but impressive.
Jeffrey!
Ha, ha, nice try, kid.
One more balloon, you
would have won a prize.
Wanna try again?
Five bucks.
This guy was King Rat.
He had all kinds of
connections who met with him
once a week for a
high-stakes poker game.
I'll see your 35
redemption tickets
and I'll raise you
a blue whale.
I'm out.
Out.
All in.
Jerry said he knew
some really notorious types.
Read 'em and weep.
I need to buy back in.
Well, then, I suggest
you hit the skee-ball.
Ready, smile!
But as far as I was concerned,
he had dreamed up the
characters program here.
Okay, smile!
And without him,
I wouldn't have a job.
A little closer, smile!
I want to see your teeth, smile!
Smile.
Okay, smile.
Smile!
Smile.
How was your first day of work, honey?
Tucker, we sold
the bed to keep us
in the house for another week.
I've got the couch
all set up for you.
Hey, I can't believe
you came back
for a second day,
man, how you feeling?
I'm all right.
I just feel like I got
lockjaw or something.
Lockjaw?
Are you smiling every time
someone takes a picture of you?
Are you smiling every
time someone takes a picture?
I blame my parents for this.
They had me trained
at a young age
to show my teeth every
time a picture was taken.
I had the same stupid
smile on my face
from birth to graduation
and I was holding that face
for eight hours in
a kangaroo suit.
Yes, can I help you?
Uh, yes, Ma'am, I'm Daryl Meyers
from the Scare Zone attraction.
Welcome to our
mansion, there's a...
Okay, double, um, I have
a family to get home to.
Actually, no, just...
You two idiots are...
Unsuspecting victims that are...
Screwed, and you don't even...
Know it.
Now let's go to the...
It's my 30, I'm up.
Where you going?
Gotta go out the main drag.
Hey, zip me up, will you?
A string
Sure. Of daring daylight robberies.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
Investigators baffled.
Elaborately disguised
is the only description
Detective Michael
Arafat released
in a statement calling
them serial bandits.
Oh, hey, I've got a question.
What's up, man?
Why are we characters
start at nine,
but this park
didn't open till 10?
Oh, well, we gotta go out
the main drag and advertise.
Huh.
Yeah.
Oh, like the guy on the
corner dressed as an enchilada
promoting the Fuzzy Taco.
You got it, Smiley, yeah.
Oh.
Hey, now help Sam
out the Bowser costume.
I'll catch you later.
Okay.
Hi, Sam.
Uh, Tucker.
Uh, okay.
Front.
Sorry, uh, I'm new
here, I didn't...
I didn't realize that some of
these unzip from the, whoa!
Shocking, aren't they?
I try to flatten
out these suckers,
but there's always one
kid that finds them.
Uh,
I'm so sorry.
Jerry, Jerry mentioned
that a Sam worked here.
I didn't, I didn't think that...
That a girl could do this?
Well, that a girl
would want to do...
Oh, I love it.
All this sweat?
I haven't gained a
pound since I started.
I mean, I can eat
whatever I want, kind of.
Uh, you're, like, you're
full-time here, then?
No, part-time.
My real job is dealing
with some other kids
down the street at
the Haven House.
You love working with children.
All kinds.
Mm-hm, oh, yeah.
Yo, guys, we just
got an all-call.
I didn't know what an all-call was,
but it seemed important
and dangerous.
As we rushed forward like lemmings
towards an uncertain fate
I felt like I was
in the Hunger Games,
heading to the reaping.
Okay, so the GM wants to talk
to all of us about something.
I'm told when he does this,
it's usually something major.
Pop, pop, popsicles.
Ice, ice, icicles, test, test,
testing one-two-three.
Nice one, boss.
Introducing the general manager
of Old Time Fun
Town Enterprises,
Mr. Benjamin Fletcher!
Thank you, thank you.
Looks like you have many
park employees here today,
and that
is just awesome.
Since the park will
be opening soon,
I'll keep my remarks brief.
When I joined you as
general manager last summer,
my goal was to
increase attendance
by offering quality
games, rides, food,
and merchandise to
our park guests.
Hey, man, just filter out
the massive amounts of BS
and you'll get the gist
of what he's saying.
Per caps increased
by a respectable margin
and monthly projections
met annual expectations.
And through my efforts,
we did about the same attendance
as we did the year before.
Now, I justified it to
our board of directors,
that their investments
probably stopped a down-turn
in attendance and that
breaking even was a good thing.
Well, they bought that,
but that did not get me my
much-deserved
bonus, so this year,
I've devised a plan to
cash in on this place.
Well, he's motivated.
Yeah, he's a piece of work,
but I am liking
those t-shirt girls.
Okay, I can sum up
that plan in one word:
Entertainment.
As you know, Old Time Fun
Town was a successful park
about 15 years ago when they
introduced Hoppy the
Kangaroo and Friends.
Since Hoppy's tragically
untimely death
12 years ago...
See ya, Pooter.
Hoppy?
Hoppy?
Hoppy?
Thanks, Hoppy, you're awesome!
And you're right, I
can be awesome, too!
And there hasn't been a
character in this park since,
until this
summer!
After hundreds of applicants
and grueling auditions,
we have assembled the new
Old Time Fun Town Characterz,
with a Z.
My grueling audition
is that I showed up.
Yeah, mine too.
Jerry, Sam, Tucky,
come on up here.
There, Sammy, over here.
Where is Stuey?
Oh, he's off today.
No, no, I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here, sorry.
Even on my day off,
I'm that dedicated.
You're standing in my light.
Sorry, sir.
Introducing Hoppy!
Newly designed by our fabulous
in-house art director,
Don Cluff.
Donnie for old Walt, uh, what,
maybe a hundred years
ago or so, Donnie?
Yeah, Walt is dead and I'm
not feeling so good myself.
Artist turned animator
turned theme park
designer extraordinaire,
who took my simple vision
and turned it into wonder,
smothered it in magic, and
sprinkled it with pixie dust.
And the rest of
the Kangaroo Krew,
spelled with a K, of course,
Cap' Jack the Parrot!
Man, I knew he'd screw that up.
Bowser the Bulldog, and
Paws the Pink Polar Bear.
So let's put our hands together
for the new Kangaroo Krew!
These characters
will be everywhere
doing promotional
visits, TV spots,
and even a parade
through the park.
A parade of four characters?
Man, that sounds like
a death march to me.
This is all to support this
summer's marketing slogan:
"Have a whale of a time
at Old Time Fun Town."
Had to cap it off,
well, to be honest,
this was really Donnie's idea.
Donnie, come up and
tell them your big idea.
Oh.
I said, "Now, you
want me to design
"you a freaking whale costume?"
Brilliant, yeah.
And now for the big reveal.
Wanna get out of here?
Girls?
Whoever can handle this
costume gets a 10% raise.
Good luck.
And introducing our
newest character
and marketing opportunity:
Doby Mick, the Big Blue Whale!
Doby Mick will be premiering
at the park's Fourth
of July celebrations.
So who wants a t-shirt?
Toby the Whale?
No, no, no, man, it's
Doby Mick the Whale, get it?
Wait, are we still
the Kangaroo Krew
or is the whale
running stuff now?
Um, separate checks, please.
Oh, like we're Moby's dicks,
like, he's Moby and we're
dicks and that's how the...
No, no, Stu, you still don't,
it's Doby, forget it, man.
Hey, uh, where's Sam?
Ooh, Sam.
Samantha, ooh, ooh, ooh.
 When Sam came into your life
Hey Jerry.
Hey Stu.
How goes it at your little park?
Who was that?
Just one of the most successful
costume characters
in the business.
Where was your comeback, man?
Stu, he's head of the union.
I'm not working for a whale.
Better than working for a mouse.
Let's do this.
 I sense the room goin' tight
 I feel the room start to bite
 Know what I'm hearing tonight
 I'm seeing some kind of light
 Sensation's growing tonight
 Know what I'm hearing tonight
 Forget it, ah, ah
 Forget it
 Forget it, ah, ah
 Forget it, ah
 Forget it
 Don't, don't remind me
 Forget it
 Just keep on smiling
Little crew is not
up to the big blue.
We need a ringer.
Franklin Jefferson Washington.
Legend had it this guy was
a pro basketball player
that got injured.
Oh, yeah!
Then he became
the team's mascot,
a huge Brahma Bull.
He became so popular
that the Mouse House
stole him away to play one of
their tall core characters.
Then he went off to start
his own delivery business.
The only reason he would
possibly be doing this job
is that he owed Fletcher a ton
of money in gambling debts.
If he was forced to be here,
you'd never know it.
Oh, yeah.
He was that cool.
Let's do this.
Even his voice was cool.
Wow.
This guy's a machine.
At that moment,
I resolved to be
a better character
for the next group of
kids that came along.
That's when I first
encountered the Red Tide.
During weekdays, Fletcher
would let day campers
into the park for
practically nothing
if they bought lunch in an
Old Time Fun Town red t-shirt.
Whoa, hey, hey!
Get him out, get him out!
You have to get
the head off first!
They touched me, I
mean, they touched me.
Why did they touch me like that?
You're one of the lucky ones.
You could have ended up
like Tommy the Turtle.
Well, what happened
to Tommy the Turtle?
The Red Shirts surrounded Tommy.
He tried to protect himself by
turning his shell toward 'em.
But the Red Shirts pushed him
into the Bumper Boat Pond.
That turtle sank like a stone.
Oh, my gosh.
Was he all right?
Nobody knows.
They dredged the pond,
but all they found
was a few pieces of fun fur
and somebody's rettainer,
but I don't think
that was Tommy's.
But they say he's
still down there.
Um, that Bumper Boat
Pond is more like
a chlorinated pool that's
only two feet deep, so...
Exactly.
Wait, no, that's not
the end of the story,
you guys not care about this?
Wait, there's fun fur, but you
know it doesn't have fun fur,
it can't, because it's a turtle.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I just feel so violated.
Are you kidding me?
Do you know how many times
I've gotten my boobs grabbed
or my butt pinched?
And that's just at my other job.
Huh?
Look, you're all right.
Those kids aren't even that
bad, so snap out of it.
Ooh, tell you what, you should
come to the Haven House.
It's on Grand Avenue
and Celebration Place.
I bet you'll come away with
a whole new perspective.
Sure, yeah.
I mean, maybe.
Yes.
The Haven House at Artisan Park
was only a few
blocks from my house,
but it took me an
hour to get there,
stopping every three feet
to build up my courage.
I was such a wuss.
Linda, sit down.
No, don't eat that
paste, Daniel, come on.
Tucker!
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you actually showed up.
Wow.
You look...
Oh, blow dried, yeah.
Crazy things happen when you
take a shower.
Uh, am I interrupting or...
No!
I can come back...
No, no, no, no, no, it's good,
we're just doing crafts
right now, come on.
Kids.
Yeah, my kids.
Cute kids.
I know, they're the best.
Here, this is Don and Jenny
and Madame Dorothy.
And how is Your
Majesty doing today?
Absolutely splendid, my dear.
Very good.
This is normal.
And here is Miss Abigail.
Abigail, that's
beautiful, what is that?
I have no fricking idea.
Contemporary art, I
love it, I love it.
Oh, Miss Patty,
this is Miss Patty,
she pretty much runs
the whole place.
Tucker, right?
I've heard a lot about you.
Okay, no more words.
And over here, excuse me.
Daniel, Daniel, don't
eat the paste, please.
Ah, come on, Sam.
I'm old, I'm not stupid.
I'm having a little fun
with Miss Priss over there.
Oh!
Lucinda.
I'm working on getting
her into the sack.
Gals like a guy
that's different.
Well, you certainly
are different, Daniel.
For my next move,
I'm gonna wear my
underwear on the outside.
Who's the dude?
Oh, this is Tucker.
I work with him at
Old Time Fun Town.
Hello.
Outside the pants,
it'll laugh them right...
Okay, thank you,
we're done, all right.
And this is the backyard.
It's not used much.
I wish we could use it more.
All this space and nothing
but a bunch of weeds.
Oh, hey, Lyle.
You're not doing crafts?
Maybe you can join us later
when we do other activities.
Daniel's taking his pants
off in the hall, again.
Okay.
Hi.
Tucker.
I work with Sam at
Old Time Fun Town.
She's a dog.
I mean, she wears
the dog costume.
I'm a kangaroo.
Kangaroo?
Yeah, yeah, I wear
a kangaroo costume.
I was attacked by a
kangaroo two nights ago!
He hopped up to me at
the ATM on 5th Street
and he robbed me of 400 bucks!
Was that you?
Nope, no, no, no, it wasn't.
Beware!
The kangaroo, beware, kangaroo!
Okay, it's okay,
Lyle, it's okay.
Sit down, okay?
Sorry, Lyle was apparently
mugged a few days ago
and it was really
traumatic for him.
The kangaroo.
I know, I know.
He was doing fine, but I
guess something set him off,
I don't know.
Kangaroo!
I know.
Maybe I should go.
Uh, sure, okay.
Um, yeah, you can just go out
the back gate there, okay?
And he punched me.
That's what kangaroos
do, you know.
I know.
Coming through!
And he had a pouch,
just like that!
Daniel!
Okay, settle down, people!
Daniel!
Stop the drumming!
Well, don't quit practicing.
Go parade between that
tree and that tree.
What?
Oh, I just see
something over there.
Like, I get it.
I get it, like, I have boxing
gloves, I'm a kangaroo.
Uh huh, yeah.
Why do you have binoculars?
I'm people-watching, man.
Yeah, but you're a parrot.
Shouldn't you have, like,
that spyglass thing?
Don't overthink it, man.
Don't forget, this
is Old Time Fun Town.
Yeah, but you're a parrot,
you should do that pirate...
Okay, so I juggle these.
But shouldn't they be pink?
They're snowballs, Stu.
Wait, does that go with this?
No, this is my bone baton.
One of your balls is
bigger than the other.
So, can I throw these now?
Not now, tomorrow,
when there are actually people
here to catch them.
Oh, okay.
How about we do like
they do in New Orleans?
I toss them to you
and you lift your...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Doesn't Universal's Mardi
Gras parade throw beads?
Isn't that kind of copying?
No, they're not beads, Jerry.
It's a string of
iridescent pearls
from the blue
whale's magic grotto.
Oh.
Okay.
Ready, guys?
Most parades One, two...
Have floats and big balloons
and lots of people and things.
Oh, well, everyone seemed
to be enjoying themselves,
except the drummers who
quit that afternoon,
but the show must go on
because the Fourth
of July was upon us.
All right, now
listen to me, we've
got Channels 6, 9, and 2,
two newspapers and
three radio stations,
as well as nine bloggers
coming in on this bus.
Whatever you do, keep
them away from Donnie.
Don't let them
interview him, okay?
He's a loose cannon.
Not even he knows what kind
of inappropriate offensiveness
might come out of his mouth.
Do you got it?
Got it, boss.
All right, good, go
get 'em, go get 'em!
Be safe out there.
When do we go on?
Like they said, not until
the press walks the park
and gets positioned in the VIP
section of the parade round.
Sam will get the call from ops.
How did I get
elected to do this?
Bravo, Tango, Harry, we
have an anxious Hoppy
ready to strut his stuff, over.
Parade characters, do you read?
Loud and clear, over.
Press is at the front gate right now.
ETA for the parade, 20 minutes.
10-4, uh, good buddy.
Is that...
No.
It is a beautiful day and it
looks like Old Time Fun Town
is a good old
place to go to town
and have a fun time this summer.
Excuse me, sir.
Hi, I'm Josh Earnest with PSTV,
Pre-School Television.
Cable 27?
You are with the park?
Yes, I'm a designer here.
Make sure you stay
inside the line, Joe.
Well, it certainly
is a whimsical display.
Yeah, it's for the
kids, it's a kid theme,
with a whale and a dog and
a rainbow there, you know.
Well, the rainbow is very
nice, and I see a rabbit...
Kangaroo!
And a kangaroo,
and, look kids,
a piratical parrot!
And while I've got you here,
why is the polar bear pink?
Hell, what do I know?
Maybe because it's a
freaking drag queen...
No!
Did I hear "drag queen"?
Is that drag queen?
Someone get him out of here!
Someone get him...
I sense a slight delay.
That interview ended up getting
about a million hits, and
for the next couple of days,
attendance actually picked up.
I guess there is no
such thing as bad PR.
It was during that delay I
thought I'd grow a pair and
strike up a conversation with
Franklin Jefferson Washington.
Uh, Mr. Washington,
can I ask you a question?
No.
Okay.
Not until you call
me by my first name.
Man, who do you think I am?
I'm wearing a bright blue
fuzzy-wuzzy whale costume.
Call me Frank.
Okay, Frank.
And I'll call you Pooter.
I'm just messing with you, man,
I heard that was your
nickname in high school.
Tucker, right?
Yeah, yeah.
What's your question?
Give it to me.
Uh, okay, um,
you're really good,
I mean, really good.
Yeah, I know.
I just, I wanna be better.
You know, I think
I need advice on...
Don't work for
your costume, man.
Make your costume work for you.
Don't work for
your costume, man.
Make your costume work for you.
Yeah.
I have no idea
what you're saying.
Modify your character.
Oh, you mean like, make
Hoppy a different type...
No, man.
Modify it.
Look in here.
Look inside
and see the magic.
It was amazing!
All the tricks,
right in front of me.
How did he stay so energetic?
Headphones with music.
If he needed a
snack, a food holder,
jelly beans, peanuts,
even chicken teriyaki.
And with this costume,
hands-free was what
it was all about.
Hey, there, little fella.
Having a good day?
I know I am.
Watch a game or
text a friend, done.
Even a fan at the
top of the head
sucked hot air out
of the costume.
And, an ashtray for one of
those foot longs he smoked.
Now, I thought to myself,
he wouldn't, he couldn't.
We're on in five minutes.
Let's get to our starting
points and suit up, everybody!
Let's do this.
That's the shortest
parade we've ever seen.
What is that smell?
Is that smoke coming
out of the whale?
Fire!
That thing's on fire!
Call the fire department!
It's burning, that's on fire!
Wait, that's not a gas can!
Goodnight, Sir
Lyle, sweet dreams.
Goodnight, Sam, coming in?
In a bit.
Ka-kaw!
Ka-kaw!
The coast is clear, you
big chicken, Lyle's inside.
Oh, I mean,
I can do a big chicken
if you want me to.
Go for it.
That did not
sound like a big chicken.
Did you bring the stuff?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh, you da man.
I'm ready for the show.
Oh, yeah,
right, right, right.
Uh...
All right.
Okay.
You ready?
Uh huh.
So this is the first.
Okay.
Oh, so cool!
All right, and this
is the second one I did.
This is, like, me at work.
Uh huh, of course.
Yes!
And little Jerry.
That's Jerry?
Yeah!
He's so tiny!
And that's me!
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
That is so cool, you did that?
Yeah.
That is so cool.
Thanks.
I tell you what, if I ever
stop being a sweaty character,
I would be a fat girl.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, like, not, oh, no,
no, I didn't mean it like...
It's okay.
Big day today.
Did Franklin get...
No, no, you know what?
He claimed what he was
smoking was for medical use.
I know, when they
tried to find him,
he already snuck out the back.
You know, I was like this close
to being his best friend, too.
Oh, yeah, like so close.
Well, you still have
Stu and Jerry and me,
at least for a little while.
What, you're leaving?
I think so.
Gerontological nurse
practitioner program.
Old people nurse.
I'm supposed to hear back
from them anytime now,
and I fly out and get a campus
tour and if it looks good,
then I would start
right after Labor Day.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's a really cool place.
It's in LA.
Oh, really, I'm going to LA!
Really?
No, no, no, I'm not.
Once I factor in all this
scholarship money that I won
and what I've saved, I'll
be, you know, I don't know,
a million dollars away
from making my tuition.
What is it that you want to do?
A girl that wanted to listen to me
blab on about what I
wanted to do with my life
and actually showed
interest and enthusiasm?
I was in.
So I gave it to her, my love
of art, design, comic books.
I almost lost her at comic books
but I got her back
with theme parks
and master planning and
rides and attractions
and the theme park greats,
Walt, George, Gary,
the true unsung heroes,
about how I'm
going to bring back
the classics, the Steeple
Chase, the Helter Skelter,
the Tunnel of Love.
You know what I want?
What?
You know what I want?
No, what do you want?
I want all of my kids
in there to feel this.
This, this, they
need to feel this.
They can't go to theme parks.
They can't go to Coney Island.
They are stuck here and
that's why they're here.
They can't travel anymore,
they can't live anymore.
I mean, all they have is this
house, a cruddy backyard,
and a few people like me.
And the TV, of
course, thank God,
or the boob tube, as Daniel
calls it, Mr. Underwear.
I'm so worried about him.
He's refused dialysis.
He hates it, he's so stubborn.
Anyway.
They need to feel.
They need to experience
true joy and wonder
one more time before they go.
So, come up with a
theme park for seniors
and I'll declare you
one of the greats.
Ready, set, go, baby, go!
Those landscapers
always have a good time.
They're just happy.
Yeah, man, they enjoy life.
Yeah, but not everyone
experiences this,
you know, this.
How could everyone
be that giddy?
You okay, dude?
You're talking like a girl.
Yeah, man.
I gotta talk to Sam
when she gets in.
Yo, you gotta wait
a week for that.
Yeah, man, she's off
to California this week
to visit the facility
and find an apartment
and, you know, what?
Wow, she got the call.
Don't worry, Tucker,
your girlfriend's
coming back next week.
She's not my girlfriend.
And I have a very
important cosplay convention
to attend this weekend, so
you have to cover for me.
What?
Yeah, I'm going as Aang, so...
Aang?
It's from Avatar, Jerry.
Oh, I love that movie,
man, with the blue people!
No, not, it's a different...
Wait, aren't you going
to have to shave your head?
No, I can do, like, effects
and stuff, it'll be fine.
Well, yeah, man, you
gotta cover for Stu
because we've been booked for
an off-site event tonight.
Yeah.
It's at a private party at
a residence in Winter Park,
and they specifically requested
"the toucan and
the hot pink bear."
Oh, house party, woot, woot!
Thanks for covering for me.
Wearing Stu's costume
without any time to clean it?
We didn't call him
Sweaty Stu for nothing.
We constantly had fans going,
trying to air out the
costumes, but Stu?
He's part man, part fountain.
What Pig Pen is to
dirt, Stu was to sweat,
and strangely proud of it.
It's hot out there, man.
Once a week, we
tear apart each costume,
wash the skin, take
the padding outside
and pressure wash
the crap out of it.
Not me, man, spray the suit!
Then we crop
dust it with disinfectant
and air purifiers and
still, Stu's big pink bear
smelled as ripe as if he
just stepped out of it.
Yo, and this one doesn't
even start till nine tonight.
Just take the costumes
and dress in the van.
George, oh man,
he won again, oh.
Yo, come on, man,
this is an easy gig.
We just stand outside the
house on the lawn here
and welcome people
as they come in.
Is it a birthday party?
No, it's like a
costume party, I guess.
So let's get suited up, come on!
It's like a pink nightmare.
Yo, Tuck, I did it once
and it's not that bad.
You just have to go for it.
Just jump into it fast and
let your sweat take over,
become one with it.
No.
You can do it.
No.
Come on, man.
He's so gross.
Dude, suit up!
Okay, okay, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.
Cold and clammy,
cold and clammy.
That's another sensory sensation
that will stay with me
the rest of my life.
Hey, ladies.
Gonna go party
with the Fire Lord.
Care to join me?
Oh, my, you look fabulous!
Oh, and right on time, too!
Oh, come close so I can tell
you what you have to do.
It's quite simple, really.
All you have to do is stand
at the edge of the walkway
and greet our lovely guests.
Oh, you don't talk, charming.
There are about 50
of my friends coming.
Once everyone has arrived,
you are more than welcome
to join the party.
Yeah?
Oh, here they come, TTFN, TTFN!
Oh, dear.
TTFN?
That means ta-ta for now.
First, how did you know that?
Second, what have
you got me into?
Here they come.
The costume was
starting to warm up,
which helped a lot,
and I was soon distracted
by the arriving guests.
Oh, look at this,
looks like a pink bear.
Meow!
Don't you see that?
They've got better
costumes than we do.
Man, I'm picturing Sam
underneath that leather!
Shut up.
We know you got a
thing for her, man.
Yo, check it out!
Ooh, pink bear, so cute.
You coming into the party?
Aw, come on, I'll
see you in there.
You see that?
What?
She pinched my bird butt.
I know, I think they want
us to join the, oh, my God.
Stu, it's me, Bear Man.
Give it up for Bear Man!
Tucker.
Tucker?
It's me, Jose, from landscaping.
I didn't know you
were into this.
Jose!
Oh, you're here!
Now the party can
officially begin.
Party time.
Come on, Jose!
I'm out.
Yo, no, no, no, no, chill,
chill, man, stay here, come on.
Oh, sh!
It was starting to
get interesting.
We were quite a hit.
Dude, I think this
is a furry party.
Oh, you think?
Yeah, I hear these
get-togethers get pretty wild.
You need to get out more
because that gives
furries a bad name.
I suppose you're right.
Yo, I think our
shift's almost over.
Incoming!
Hi, honey.
Perhaps just a peek around back.
I mean, we were invited.
Yeah, to the pool!
I can't see with
these lights in my face.
Then we gotta lift
up our heads, man.
I can't do it.
Just do it.
And the winner, with
the best plushie,
is Dante!
Good job, it even
looks just like you.
Now, who's ready for a great
game of Cards Against Humanity?
Not what I expected.
Oh, boys.
Those furballs don't know
how to have a good time.
Come next door.
Things are in full swing.
I'd never seen
real swingers before.
Now I'll never be
able to un-see them.
Yo, you don't see
that every day.
Jerry, one of those ladies
works at the grocery store
in the produce section.
You know...
No zucchini jokes, please.
A balmy 82 degrees.
Top of the news hour, with
your local WPAX report.
Earlier this evening, the
sixth in a string of robberies
appears to be the most
brazen as thieves have gone
from targeting ATMs, joggers,
and convenience stores
to their first bank heist.
Yo, they're talking...
Feeling that
releasing any information
may cause copycat robberies.
We'll be right back
after this message
from the new Old Time Fun Town.
 You're sure to
have a happy day
 At Old Time Fun Town
 So many things to see and do
 It's humongous
It's humongous!
It's so small.
Even with Sam gone for a week
and Stu at a cosplay convention,
I managed to talk Mr. Lloyd
into giving me a day off.
And yep,
Fletcher's parade
was pretty much
a parrot, some t-shirt girls,
whichever stilt-walker
showed up,
and a stuffed whale.
This is as bad as that
Scare Zone thing they did
on Halloween.
Worse.
Oh, oh, my God.
But I wasn't gonna let
the guilt distract me.
Nope, I had a more
important mission,
even if it was going to set me
back a couple hundred bucks.
Hey, Mom?
Where's the electric
screwdriver?
We sold it, honey!
The circular saw?
Sold that, too.
The drill?
Sold it.
Like I said, I had a mission,
even if it was going to set
me back another 370 bucks.
Meanwhile in the park...
Empty your pockets.
Not those pockets,
your jacket pockets.
Oh, you got something
to say, punk?
Then empty those pockets.
You're not even supposed
to bring food in this park.
You have to eat our food,
next pocket, now, come on.
Oh, a dart from the
balloon buster game.
You like stealing
our property, kid?
Yeah, you do, in fact,
hold still.
Hold perfectly still.
You like stealing our stuff.
You like stealing
from our games.
I've got a little game for you.
It's called Dart to the Brain.
Ah, let's get out of here.
Give me the broom, just...
With summer in full swing,
Fletcher had his marketing
plan in high gear,
and we were a big part of it.
We got to take one of his
convertibles out to the highway,
where we teamed up with
a highly aggressive
and super-motivated sales
rep to do anything possible
to bring in business.
That dreaded 6:00 to 8:00
morning drive time shift
was grueling, at least
for the character.
Between parades, each
character had to promote
the sales of his or
her animal character.
Fletcher had the bright idea
that Hoppy could have a baby
Hoppy come out of its pouch,
that that would somehow appeal
to a potential female
buyer's motherly instinct.
That idea looked
better on paper.
And in the evenings, I would
crank up my man, Justin Hayward
and hammer away.
Mom!
Excuse me.
Oh, okay.
What, dude, did you
party last night?
No, I pulled an all-nighter
trying to finish this project
with nothing but hand tools
and my car headlights
to see what I was doing.
Oh!
Yeah!
Now I gotta move all this
stuff, I have to set it up,
I mean, there's no way.
Well, what project
are you talking about?
Whoa, did you design this?
Yup.
But, I mean, I'll never
get it done in time.
I don't know what
I was thinking,
I mean, it's just
not going to happen.
Yo, what are friends for?
You'll help me?
No, but this looks like
it takes place outdoors.
Yeah.
Well, you need to
call on the pros.
It's time you meet the crew.
Yeah, my little
project needed much more
than I could build to fill
up hundreds of square feet
of grass, weeds,
and cement driveway,
but the landscapers
had a great idea:
We could borrow some stuff
that hadn't been
used for decades.
Surely that was okay.
Wait, Jerry, it's okay, right?
Yeah, man, it's not
like we're stealing.
We're just putting this
junk to good use.
I mean, they have
everything except, uh...
Oh, well, now I guess
they got that, too.
Okay.
Man, so much stuff
everywhere, gosh.
Whoa, the original Hoppy?
No way.
Check it out, man,
there's a spare bear.
Huh, you mean I
didn't have to climb
into Sweaty Stu's
disgusting bear?
I guess these are
backups just in case.
Oh, yo, look at that!
Awesome, yeah,
yeah, that'll work.
I'll take that, what is this?
Let's see this, ooh,
I love these things,
these are great, take all
that, perfect, thank you.
Uh, hey, the ice cream?
Bring this, uh, this
can go, that can go.
What is this?
No way!
What?
Yes!
Dude, so cool, that's so cool!
We gotta bring this.
Hey, Sam.
Goodnight, Sam.
Hi, bye.
What's going on here?
You've gotta check on Daniel.
It's been five days
since his last dialysis,
and it's shutting down.
It hasn't effected his
bad attitude, though.
Daniel, why are you doing this?
I'm just trying
to go peacefully.
There's this dang-blasted
racket going on
in the backyard, all
dang-blasted day.
I think you guys need to
come outside and see this.
Tucker?
I should have known you had
something to do with this!
Oh, pipe down, old man.
The kid's got
something to show you.
Jerry.
Jerry?
Lights, please.
Wow.
Patty.
Shall we?
 Once upon a time
 Once, when you were mine
 I remember skies
 Reflected in your eyes
 I wonder where you are
 I wonder if you think about me
 Once upon a time
 In your wildest dreams
 When the music plays
 And when the words
are touched with sorrow
 When the music plays
 When the music plays
 I hear the sound
I had to follow
 Once upon a time
 Once upon a time
 Once, when you were mine
 I remember skies
 Mirrored in your eyes
 I wonder where you are
 I wonder if you think about me
 Once upon a time
 In your wildest dreams
Yo, that was amazing last night.
Total success, bro,
you are the man.
So now, tell me how
the ride was with Sam.
It was fine.
Fine?
Well, how was the first kiss?
There was no kiss.
I know, I know, there
was this perfect moment
and I just got nervous.
I blew it.
Tuck, yo, she likes
you, I know she likes you.
You just gotta tell
her how you feel.
No.
Yeah, no, no, no, I don't see
that going over very well.
Just tell her.
Sam.
Hello.
No.
Hey, Sam.
No, that's my daddy.
Hey, Sam, last night was great,
and you're really great,
and it'd be really great.
No, no!
No, no, no.
Uh, Sam.
So, Samantha.
Some good times last night, eh?
No.
Uh, hello,
'sup, God, no.
Poppy, look, it's a koala bear.
Oh, man, it was happening again.
Another round of
guess the species.
Ha, well, you got
his homeland right,
but, you see, long ears?
Long ears.
And a pouch?
And a pouch.
Makes him a kangaroo.
Kangaroo?
Yup.
Oh, hallelujah!
The tourist got it right!
And you know where
kangaroos come from?
England?
No, that's where we come from.
Hoppy here comes from Australia.
Oh, I wanted to kiss the guy.
Poppy and Hoppy.
Nice to meet you,
Hoppy from Australia.
Can I please have
your autograph?
Not you, Fido.
Mr. Edge, can we please
get your autograph?
Oh, it'll be my pleasure.
Edge?
Holy crap!
I wanted to yell, "It's Graeme
Edge of the Moody Blues!"
Poppy, Hoppy knows your name!
Well, okay.
Oops.
Let's say bye-bye to
Hoppy and we'll go.
We'll go-ho-ho.
Okay, nobody moves.
Could I borrow your pen again?
Thank you.
Does anybody have
a piece of paper?
Ah, that will do
nicely, thank you.
Okay, oh, no, come on.
Let's do this the
old-fashioned way.
Okay, Hoppy, have a great day
at the Old Time Fun Town.
Ah, oh, oh, my biggest fan.
Can I have my pen back?
Jerry, I did it, I did it!
Oh, man, when you were
screaming, "I did it,"
I thought you had found at least
one ball and talked to Sam.
Instead, you show me a
crumpled up park map?
Look, Jerry, you don't get it.
This is Graeme Edge!
Moody Blues?
Graeme Edge, you're
talking gibberish, man.
Now focus, we're
talking about Sam, here.
Now, do you want me
to tell her or what?
No, Jerry, I'd die.
Well then, man up and find
the right moment to tell her.
You owe me, I went through
hell helping you build
and operate Backyard
Theme Park World
for you to impress that girl.
Seriously, man, you
can't fail me now!
Just tell her.
Man, I can do this.
I can do this.
I just, Sam.
Sam, I just, I just want to...
Um,
listen, listen,
I gotta say something to you.
I like you,
a lot.
And last night was
almost perfect.
I just, I just forgot
to do one thing.
Well, this is awkward.
Why are you wearing Bowser?
Covering for Sam.
You covered for me,
covering for her.
Well, where is she?
I don't know, I'm not Match.com.
Stu, thank you so much
for covering for me!
Everybody wants me today.
Tucker, Tucker, you did it!
You did it, Daniel
isn't quitting,
I took him to dialysis this
morning, I could just...
 I know you're
out there somewhere
 Somewhere, somewhere
 I know I'll find you somehow
 And somehow I'll
return again to you
 And you know it's gonna happen
 I keep thinking
 Feel you getting near
 Soon you'll be returning
 To the fountain of our youth
 And if you wake up wondering
 In the darkness
 I'll be there
 My arms will close around you
 And protect you with the truth
 I know you're
out there somewhere
 Somewhere, somewhere
 I know you're
out there somewhere
 Somewhere you
can hear my voice
 I know I'll find you somehow
 Somehow, somehow
 I know I'll find you somehow
 And somehow I'll
return again to you 
Freeze!
Sit down!
Losers.
Okay, guys, look.
Everybody stay calm.
We took the stuff from the
warehouse for the old people
and for Sam and we're
going to return it.
It was all for a good
cause, so everybody chill
and I'll do the talking.
It was them, they did it,
they stole that stuff
from the warehouse.
I'm innocent, I was at
a cosplay convention.
A what convention?
Never mind.
I'll tell you what,
I'll take your statement
about the warehouse
robbery later.
Right now, what I need you to do
is to turn that
off, turn off the,
turn it off, man, just this,
no drips.
But I...
Oh, ah, zip it, just, mm,
you zip it.
And you, you look damn familiar.
Lady and gentlemen, I
have something I'd like
for the four of you
to take a look at.
Viola, otherwise, voilà.
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you are in?
We didn't do this.
Oh, cut this, cut this,
"I'm so innocent as a little
baby green puppy, I didn't.
"I'm innocent, I swear to God!"
I ain't buying, baby.
But I am, we are innocent.
And you are just
the happy little
toucan camper,
aren't you, with the,
with the bird stuff, man.
What up with the
bird stuff, toucan?
Man, I'm a, I'm a parrot.
And you, I have no
idea what you sound like.
Sir, don't we get a phone call?
Oh, you do get your
phone call, Hoppy.
You're gonna get
your phone call,
but you gotta understand something,
it's gonna be more like,
"Hello, hello?"
"I'm sorry but Hoppy
is going to prison
"for a very, very long time,
"for more information,
please press pound,
"oh, press pound again."
By the way, are you sure I
don't know you from somewhere?
Uh, excuse me, sir?
Yes?
Could you please play
that one more time?
Seriously?
You want me to play this again?
You all get off on
doing stuff to people?
You all get off on this,
is that what this is?
Is this like a, like a,
like a quadro-freaky thing?
Sure, why not?
Y'all must be getting off on
crimes and hurting people.
I can't believe you guys
used my costume for a crime.
When did these happen?
How about you let me ask
the questions, shall we?
Where were you at 4:55 PM yesterday?
We were at a party...
No, we weren't there!
Excuse me, Detective,
we need to see you for
a minute over here.
Stay.
Thanks a lot.
I cannot believe that.
Why would you tell him that...
It wasn't us!
Okay, here's the news.
The three of you's
alibis check out
and you are very
lucky, graffiti boy.
I know you now.
What are you three
sitting around here for?
You are free to go.
Let's go, scoot.
Scoot, scoot, scoot.
Not you, stay here.
Cosplay is not even a real word.
You're up to something,
and I'm gonna figure
out what this is.
Karma!
So when we were borrowing props
from the old warehouse, we
found these duplicate costumes.
Oh, those film-flammers
needed a disguise
to do the crimes.
Yeah, you know, it didn't
make sense at the time
until we saw the hand gestures
from the surveillance video.
The ops guys were setting us up.
They were giving you
the old rigmarole.
You dumb mugs were
the perfect patsies.
Luckily, your story
was bought by the dick.
Let's just say detective.
We gotta clear Stu.
Do we?
Let's get back to the
21st century, all right?
These were duplicate costumes
that we've never worn.
Think about how much we sweat?
You're right, man,
those costumes have got
to be dripping with their DNA.
We get the costumes to the
cops, they do a forensics.
Yeah, so let's go
back, we'll suit up,
and just act like
nothing ever happened.
That's a suicide mission.
Yeah, there's no way
they're gonna let us back
into the warehouse now.
They're probably
watching it like a...
But with a little diversion
from our friends here...
We're in!
The kittens are handed.
What time does the three
o'clock parade start?
What?
What time does the three...
Let's go, put it
in the bag, put it.
Okay.
Hurry up.
Well, well, well,
looks like the felons
have returned to the
scene of the crime.
Oh, thanks for bagging
that up for us.
They have a date
with the incinerator.
I don't think so, man.
Stu's at the general
manager's office right now
telling Mr. Fletcher
that it was you guys
robbing people blind with
your little hand gestures.
Yeah.
Right.
Great job, guys.
Yes!
Not you, idiots.
Great job, guys.
You know, it was...
You know it has
always been my plan
to cash in on this joint,
a little skimming, a
little book-making,
they were all well and
good as far as they went,
but nothing has
been as lucrative
as our little
character crime spree.
Robbing the bank was
a little over the top,
and we will have
a chat about that.
And I would have
gotten away with it,
if it hadn't been for
you meddling kids.
Ruh-roh.
But hey, thanks for
doing your part.
We have made obscene
amounts of money,
and now it's time for us to
ride off into the sunset,
and for you to disappear.
George, you're in my light.
And now I've lost my train
of thought altogether.
Fine, you, go get the
van, bring it around.
The rest of you clean up this
mess and vanish this janitor.
Freeze!
Ringleader, he goes.
Anybody with a blue shirt goes.
Hey, man, is that wedgie?
The rest of the summer
wasn't nearly as exciting,
and since the cops took
the costumes as evidence,
we were forced to work with
whatever we could
get our hands on.
Hoppy's Kangaroo Krew
was back together.
Even though some of the costumes
came from unusual sources,
the kids still loved us,
and before we knew it,
the summer was over.
That fall, Stu started his own
furry cosplay costume company
and his products are a huge
hit with the alternative crowd.
And you won't believe who
Stu's top sales agents are.
Bonus checks.
Yeah!
Ladies, five, six, seven, eight.
Even though the park was mothballed
for the winter, Jerry was
asked to stay on full-time
and got a promotion to
Director of Entertainment.
Ha, my man!
The next summer, he
created a hit musical
on Fletcher's old stage.
George, love it, give me some!
Sam?
Well, she went off to California
and is working on her
degree in elder care,
and I made it to
California, too.
How, you ask?
Turns out I have some
fans that started
the Tucker Goes to
CalArts Scholarship Fund.
Whoa!
Thank you, sir, guys!
Oh, no, Daniel, this
is way too much.
Ah, keep it, kid.
We're not in here
because we're bored.
We're just old.
Yeah.
So, life is good.
I'm not sure what
the future holds
or what kind of adults
we'll turn out to be,
but I know that, deep down,
we'll always be Characterz.
Yeah, with a Z.
That turtle sank like a stone.
Oh!
Do you remember writing this?
I don't remember this part.
"Oh, my gosh, was he all right?
"Insert funny line here."
 Oh, they're furry and funny
 Chubby and charming
 Characters to make you
 Smile
