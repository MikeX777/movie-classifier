SHANGHAI 1937
War of Resistance Against Japan has begun
Stop!
What's the problem?
The Japanese have landed in HK.
A curfew will be enforced soon.
So what!
This is the French concession.
They wouldn't dare come here.
I don't care, I'm going to the nightclub.
French concession...
To hell with them!
Keep your hands to yourself!
There's no place like this in the world.
So many legends, So beautiful, So great.
You and me,
There's no day or night.
It will go on, forever and ever.
Tou has raised the price of rice so high,
pretty soon we'll be eating bread.
French wines and Cigarettes, Chinese suits,
In this wonderful place, it all comes together.
Stop complaining
You've been in the French quarters,
for so long you should be used to bread.
Your stomach probably can't take
rice anymore.
This is the French concession,
This is a place to forget all your worries.
Rice, bread, it's all the same
just as long as your full.
Let's not worry about tomorrow
as long as there's wine today. Cheers!
Wait a minute!
Don't leave like this!
What will I tell my uncle?
Tell him the truth.
They're paying us double over there.
What would you do in our shoes?
Let's go!
Wait!
Me and you and me and him, we want to make!
This most fabulous place our home!
Have a laugh, sing a song, do a dance!
This tiny place is like Heaven
My nose is gone.
Where is my nose?
Uncle, here's your nose.
These noses are the other guys'
That reminds me, where are they?
They went across the street,
They're being paid double there.
What will we do?
You know what uncle, I want to
quit too.
What! Even you've turned against me?
No, I just don't want to be a clown anymore.
When the world is in a mess,
there's no better job than a clown.
-I want to enroll in the army.
-You in the army?
An Adventurer's Paradise.
A Rich man's Heaven
A Ladies place of delight
You should quit too.
The Japs are here.
You and Auntie,
should both make plans.
They re really here?
Yes.
Clown's you're on next!
Forget it, no more clowns
were leaving.
The Japanese are already here.
Go, tell the boss him and his family
can be the clowns.
Go on!
Lett's take this stuff off.
Take this, it has a really nice sound.
Why? I'm going to be a soldier
not a musician.
I know that idiot.
Sell it, you can use the money.
You can't go to war
with a empty stomach.
Going to be a soldier, eh?
Look at yourself!
Like that, much better.
Me and you and me and him, we want to make!
This wonderful place our home
Have a laugh, sing a song, do a dance!
This tiny place is our Heaven
They're bombing.
What do we do?
It's so dark!
Power failure.
Let's hide.
Why did you push me?
I couldn't see!
Are you allright?
We can swim across to the Concession!
Look over there.
Why is there such a huge fire?!
Where is that?
In Zhabei and Hong kou.
Zhabei?
My family is there, I have to go back.
No. It's too dangerous.
I have to save them!
They are still bombing. Listen to me!
Come back. Don't go!
Why is it so quiet?
The way it's burning like that,
there'll be nothing left.
- Where are you going?
- To fight in the war, Godbye.
Don't cry.
There's no use crying.
Give me your hand.
Whatt is itt?
The money I earned today as a clown.
Why are you giving it to me?
Take it. For a rainy day.
You'll find a use for it.
I'm going to fight, I don't know if I'll be back.
Wait!
Wait. You must remember this.
We will win!
Right. We'll win. there's no doubt in my mind.
Be confident.
You have to come back.
After we ve won, we'll meet here again.
We'l meet here under this bridge.

I'm really really sorry.
Poor girl!
Don't be so stupid from now on.
In life, you have to be brave.
Look at me,
I'm all alone, no money, no friends.
I must wander in the streets,
without nowhere to go.
However, I don't want to commit suicide.
It should be me trying to kill myself.

Taking a shower.

What was that?!
I've never seen a man ashaminig himself before.
Tell me what'd you see?!
Lot's of soap suds!
I always sleep alone.
You take the sofa, I take the bed.
Good night.
But, the bed is more comfortable.
The rat!
How did you get here?
Get back on the sofa!
What are you doing?
Do re mi!
Get up!
They raised the price of rice to $70.
Trading is restricted, They're all buying
up penicillin.
Banks are closing down!
How can you sleep?!
Open the windows,
let the sun in,
breathe the fresh air.
Have some nutritious Dried milk
free from the church.
Dried milk?
Everytime you bring something,
you want something.
Can you lend me $ 2 million?
I need it to pay the rent.
Bad timing.
My wallet was stolen.
Ask the pickpocket, maybe he can
lend you some money.
So, this money isn't yours?
Right, it's not mine.
Perfect
I have to return that.
I need it to save me now.
I thought we were friends?
Enough of this bul-shit. Bye.
Asshole!
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
Those Hairy legs again!
I'm sure I heard a noise, A ghost!?
Get down from there.
It's dangerous. Careful
I hurt myself.
So it's you?
I wasn t peeping.
I was only the stool.
What do you mean?
the stepping stool.
I don't understand.
It s nothing. Goodbye.
Waitt a minute.
Is it that high?
I almost fell all the way down there.
Wake up.
Where am I?
I carried you inside.
What else did you do?
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
Lucky I woke up so fast.
Wait! I want to ask you. Have you ever
been to Suzhou bridge?
- Yes.
- What for?
I jumped.
You jumped?
Yes. To save somebody.
Really?
It was yesterday evening.
What about ten years ago?
It really is you!?
I found you finally!
What are you doing?
I don't know what your talking about.
When you said "ha"!
I thought you were her.
If you embrace me when I say "ha"
You'd probably rape me if I said "oach"
I did not go there ten years ago,
it was yesterday.
I've got the wrong person.
Is this your wife?
Yes...no! She's a friend.
Is she transparent?
No.
I don't know what she looks like.
I've been looking for 10 years.
You say you know her, but
you don't know who she is?
And you don't know what she looks like.
Either youre a faithful idiot,
or just a plah idiot.
I would say you must be a faithful idiot.
Yes, your right.
Your friends must be helping you
find her.
Yes.
I want to help find her.
Great.
Rat!
Uncle.
Why are you always so late?
A woman knocked me out.
You lost your job yesterday for a woman.
Don't do the same again today.
You wouldn't understand.
Understand!
Keep away from women!
The Dollar has collapsed
Gold is soaring!
When is it my turn,
there'll be no more left.
Keep in line
10 silver dollars per person only!
I've stil got the scar from lining
you for rice.
My turn.
I was first.
Two more to go.
My head!
Are you ok?
Don't push.
The last time, it was on the left.
There, I was on the right.
Careful.
- Deoh't push.
- Comme onn.
No more, disperse!
Disperse, there's no more.
Are you alright?
I'm fihee.
That voice...
Can you say that again, "I'm fine"?
I'm fine.
Move along then if your fine!
What's wrong with him?
telling you to say I m fine, I'm fine!
Another woman?
You'd leave me to die for any woman.
It's not that.
It's her voice,
She seems so familiar from the back.
All woman look the same from behind.
From behind and the front too,
they all look the same!
They're looking for a school teacher!
I don't think the jobs right for you.
They get paid very little.
Little is better than nothing.

Me like this! And You like that!
If somebody saw us,
I wonder what they would think.
Do re mi!
Do-re-mi Fa-so-la-si!
Looking for mne?
Hey, Stool!
Open up.
Don't open it, with me here.
I wont open it.
Don't look at me, look at her.
Why?
Why what?
I asked first.
With me like this, she can't see me.
We haven't done anything.
Exactly, you haven't done anything.
So hurry and open up.
You can't open the door.
I can't open the door!
Do re mi! If she sees me like this
were both dead!
Do re mi!
Tell her to leave.
Do re mi, where are you?
I'm coming. Stop shouting.
Stool, where are you?
Here.
You climbed through the window?
I'm used to it.
Not bad, huh?
By seeing you all black,
Shu got scared and sick.
She's very timid.
Don't scare her like that again.
These people all look very familiar.
It's her!
- What's that noise?
- A rat.
A rat?
Have some milk.
It's good for you.
Thank you.
You're so good to me.
I looked all day for a job.
I had no money for food.
I was so hungry.
Someone stole all my money.
I'm lucky Shu took me in.
It's all that thief's fault.
If I find him,
I'll wring his head off!
and make stuffed duck out of him!
I know who stole your money.
You do?
The money you had was...
Don't open the door!
It must be Shu
looking for me.
If she finds me here,
she ll make fun of me.
I've got to hide.
Play it by ear.
I've got to play it by ear too!
We'll all have to play it by ear!
Do re mi!
There you are
Wheres the money?
I spent it all!
On Tea, oil, sauce, rice etc...
Thanks to this money, I survived.
Take this.
I'm not talking to you!
Don't be mad.
You help me, I help you...
who knows what will happen from now on?
You couldn't have come
at a worse time.
Now, you've made it even worse.
I just took a little money from you.
We cant be friends anymore?
I should've never talked to you from day 1.
Are you nuts?
what are you talking about?
Show yourself!
Come on out, or I'll get you!
So it's you?
OOk... . Stool, come over here.
He's the one who took your money.
Give it back to me!
He s the one who spent it.
Why did you do that?
Give me back my money!
Why don't you give it back to him now?
Then where did my money go?
If you pay him back, then he
can pay you back.
Then who'll pay me back!?
lf he pays you back then you'll have money.
Give me back my money!
This is complicated!
But, that's not all.
You still haven't seen what's in here.
Come on out, lets all get complicated.
There is someone else?
Shu.
I don't believe this!
I thought we were friends.
I swear to you that nothing
happened between us.
You were both only almost naked together.
Look at you, you were wearing his pajamas.
He told me to put it on,
I didn't want to.
Told you?
what if he told you not to put anything on!
You want to steal him away from me.
It's not true.
Don't talk like that.
Not true! then, why were hiding
in the cupboard?
You were hiding too.
I...
What's that?
I am not as cheap and easy as you are.
What did you say?
I said "Cheap and Easy."
How dare you! You eat my food,
wear my clothes, live in my place.
If you want to move. Move!
Don't be a mooch!
I'll go far away.
I'm leaving now.
I wont be a much to you anymore.
I thought you left?
Shu.
Can I borrow some money for some food.
I haven't eaten anything all day.
Just a little.
I will pay you back one day.
If you want money,
go earn it.
Go on. Don't try to get pity from me.
Why> don't you go upstairs to him?
Why should I?
He's not my husband.
That one, I'll let you have him.
I can live without a man.
I don't want you to let me have him.
Don't worry,
I ve been waiting for someone for a long time.
Who?
Ah old friehd it's been ten years.
It's about time he came back for me.
That's good. Then now we won't fight.
Shu, let's not talk about men anymore.
It's all their fault.
Come...Let s go home.
I'll make something for us to eat.
I'm starving. Come!
My legs are weak.
Comrades!
There's no more blood left.
You don't have to worry.
Look what I brought.
Thank you Do re mi.
Light the fire, I'll cook them.
It s dirty.
Don't put all rice.
But I must!
We'll even eat the worms too.
We're going to have a true meal.
This girl is always down here.
Is she the one the tuba players looking for?
She has long hair though.
What is it?
Shu Pei In! How dare you do what you did?
One inch on the left
or one inch on the right.
On which side do you prefer?
To hell with you!
Go to hell!
Wrong guy, It's me.
Why didn't you say so.
Stop! Stop fighting!
You dirty bums fighting?
I haven't even eaten yet.
Attention!
Let's send these bums on their way!
How dare you stab me from behind?
Don't worry I'll pull it out.
Your going away pal.
Tear this place apart!
Hold this.
This time,
it looks as if we mush part.
Perhaps, we will see each other again
on the battle field.
- Tuba payer!
- Be quiet!
I have to tell him something.
Tell him on the battle field.
- You know these beggars?
- We were in the army together.
Let me do it.
You save me once again, we'd better
not meet again.
What did I do?
I think that you should treat Stool better.
What?
She is really good to you.
And me, I am nice to you.
Why aren't you good to me?
Lot's of men are nice to me,
you're just one more.
I get it.
You want to know how I feel about you.
What are you talking about?
I don't mean that!
When a woman says that,
she means the opposite.
Why don't you carve
two hearts on the wall!
You think you're Don Juan?
What do you take me for?
For a woman.
Rubish!
Did you find a job?
Want some milk?
You women think you're the best!
She's like that, and your like
this, pouting!
Hey I can be pouty too,
Look!
If you're such a big deal,
why did you come looking for me?
You want to throw a glass?
I can do that too.
why do you do that?
Ok, Throw my cups! Lets throw to them all!
Stop! mines smaller than yours.
Why are you mad at me?
You men look down on women!
If we don't bully you, you'll bully us!
Pouting all day long, even when
you're not even mad about anything!
Pouting day and night, even on the toilet...
To hell with it!
You want to fight?
put down the trophy and fight!
Very well, come on!
Out of breath?
If you're a man, stop moving.
And let me hit you.
I'm not as stupid as you women.
Please let me hit you once.
otherwise I'll feel awful.
Come on.
How did the bottle get there?
Do-re-mi, you ok?
I didn't mean it.
If you did't mean it, when you really do<
I'l die for sure!
Don't die... . I couldn't bear it.
Look at that one.
No, she's the best.
Not only are you good with money,
Your just as good at picking girls.
You have great taste.
Who has great taste?
You, Chairman Yu.
Chairman Yu,
what can I do for you?
Many Merchants have
sponsored this contest.
Remember that the contest is aimed
towards common housewives.
Of couurse.
These girls look like whores.
Chairmah Yu.
They are the ones that we eliminated.
I know. I paid the most money to win this contest.
So, I'll get to pick who I please!
This one!
Uncle you really want to move

I almost have enough money.
Careful!
I'll try to help you.
If you looked at fewer girls,
I would be fine.
"South Pacific"
We have to go to work, uncle.
I'll take you along with me.
Away from this poverty!
Uncle, same as usual?
No. I can't take it anymore,
you do it.
A gift for any purchase!
The more you buy,
the more gifts you have!
Without you, the old man
would have been less generous.
Enjoy it.
It's expensive stuff!
With all that I bought you,
Don't I desenrve a kiss?
You sure do!
And you? Come on!
This side too.
Let's get in.
Let's go.

I'll buy the entire street for you.
What are you looking at?
We're working! It's my turn!
Shu Pei lin, why are you so quiet?
Watch it! my hand still hurts.
Stop the car! I'm getting out!
It's dangerous.
Someone's hurt, don't steal my cotton!
Where you going?
She's my friend.

How is your leg?
the cotton case fell on her.
We have to take her to the hospital.

Where are you going?
To Hong Kong. Someone asked me
to open a cabaret there.
Hohg Kong?? how is it there?
A real melting pot of people.
An ideal place
for a man of my talents.
Then, congratulations.
Shu Pei lin.
I wonder why
nobody wants this ring.
We're not made for each other.
I know that I'm a litte over the hill.
Don't I have any hope at all?
I have hope.
If I give it to you,
I wont have anymore.
Don't move!
You're hurt. You shouldn't move.
My plant!
Why aren't you resting.
Go lie down.
My leg.
don't move.
Shu, I've been thinking.
I'l find a job and we'll
have a menage a trois.
What a menage a trois?
You, me, and then Do-re-mi.
The three of us.
You and him can, butt leave me out of it.
Don't ever get into my line of work.
It's enough that one of us is doing it.
Once your in, it's hard to find a good husband.
Don't worry, I would never
get into your line of work.
Don't forget.
That you can't move, Ok.

I told you not to move.
I won't move anymore.
Come here!

With this Power failure,
You can't see anything.
It's better than that night ten years ago.
Ten years ago?
Don't you remember?
When Shanghai...
Was bombed by the Japanese.
10 years ago.
It was chaos in the streets.
I was all alone,
I was very afraid.
Me too.
I pushed somebody under a bridge.
It was worse for me,
I was pushed under a bridge.
It was so dangerous, so we hid
underneath that bridge.
He wouldn't let me leave to go
back home to Zhabei.
Zhabei?
He was carrying a violin.
She was carrying an umbrella.
He said he was going to fight in the war.
He even gave me his money.
She even gave him a farewell kiss.
It was you?
I've finally found you.
I can't believe this.
Is it really you?
Why didn't we recognize each other
earlier?
It's not to late, now.
Shu Pei lin.
The power is back on.
Your leg.
These gold bars are really heavy.
How did I end up under here?
How come you're here?

He was lying on the bed, naked.
Beside him, there was
