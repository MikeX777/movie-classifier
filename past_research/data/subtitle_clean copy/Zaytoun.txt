Leclair: Who is
Churchill?
His dog.
I knew this
would happen.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry, Fahed.
You are

Can you come here?
Is he okay?
He is.
But he's sad.
When are they sending
him to Beirut?
Today.
We'll reunite him
with his grandfather.
His grandfather?
Why?
His parents
are dead.
I think this
belongs to you.
It is my baba's tree.
From our land.
Before we can take it
home to plant it, he die.
Nail bomb.
Four
weeks ago.
Are you sure you want
to do this?
I need 24
hours with him.
We'll be okay.
man: Hey, hey, hey!
Yoni, Yoni!
So what's the plan?
Where do we find
this village of yours?
I don't know.
Great.
So, left or right?
Left, I think.
You think?
We'll go right.
It's --
No.

Fahed!

Where we go now?
To a fancy hotel.
It's runway 11.
The other is 9.
This is where he took off.
My baba--
Major --
Killed in action,
June 7th, 1967.
How old you were?
A little
older than you.
And you
miss him?
All the time.
I miss my
baba, too.
Listen, Fahed.
I have to take
you back.
We're not gonna find it.
Stop, stop,
tell him to stop!

It's going to--
Stop it!
That's the express,

No, it stop in--
It doesn't stop
anywhere.

Fahed: Turn, left,

Here, here,
I know it's here.
Where?
Down.
Down, down,
it's okay, I know.
- Where are we going?
- Down, down.
Go right,
go right.
Are you sure?
Yes, go to the big tree,
my baba told me about it.
- Stop, stop!
- Why here?
Stop, just stop!
Where there's a cactus,
there is village.


Fahed: My baba was
right about the stars.
Yoni: It's beautiful.

What's that?
Some herb.
For--
For who?
My grandfather.

Good,
Fahed, good.
Do you want to stay?
If I can find a way,
do you want to stay?
Will-- come?
And Hassan--
And
Churchill?
You're taking

He is Palestinian dog.
I know,

Absolutely.
He's a Palestinian dog.
Yoni.
Will you

That depends.
Are you
behaving yourself?

Leclair: Okay, --
man: Thank you very much,
good bye.
Hello, Fahed.
Thank you,
Lieutenant.
Thank you, Major.
I will tell him it's from
the Palestinian Ziko.
He will love it.
Leclair: Fahed,

Maybe next, I will not
shoot you in the ass.
Hey.
Look after yourself.
Go.
