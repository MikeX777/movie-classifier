I am here in Trafalgar Square...
It has just been reported that a
bomb has gone off here 10 minutes ago...
The whole country is
in a state of shock.
This is the worst hit
since the 9/11 incident...
...in the United States of America...
This is the biggest terrorist
attack that has shaken London.
The Government is doing all that it
can to keep the citizens calm and safe
This morning...
Amazing Grace...
How sweet the sound...
That saved a wretch like me...
I once was lost, but now I'm found...
What is this song?
It's an MGR Song...
"MGR"
...Who is "MGR"?
Hey!! What do you mean by who is MGR?
We know who Arnold is...
Don't you know who MGR is?
If you were to ask this
question in Tamil Nadu...
You will be in a soup...
What is he saying?
In this song...?
If you know, you know,
you can take on the world...
Stop! Stop! This is where I get out...
15 Pounds...
Sir, no job, no money, no house...
I want to go to my homeland...
Please give me a Tip...
You know, you know,
you can win the world...
MGR said...
Thank you!
Sir... Taxi...?
Sir... Where do you have to go?
I need to go to Leicester Square...
Are you a Tamilian?
Did you take notice, Sir...?
It's our people who
spend money to hire a Taxi...
People from here walk to every place,
as if they were Diabetic...
This is money they
brought back from our place,
why can't they spend it?
Misers!!
Sir... here's the
address you want to go to...
Please finish your work and
come back... l'll wait for you...
What...?
Who are you?
Who are you?
You!!
I've got nothing to do with it...
Leave me... Please...
I've got nothing to do with it... Please...
Hey, Mate! Move, your bloody car!
Hey!! Wait, Man!
I'll come in this direction!
You go in that direction!
Which direction?
Maniratnam's Direction! Look at him!
What the hell is going on?!
What do you want?
My God!
Hey!! Hey!!
Watch it! How dare you touch
the car, you bald fellow!!
What?
- Are you some big shot from Piccadilly?
What are you saying to me?
If you dare to, touch me!! Come on!
What are you trying to do...?
A body! Body! A dead body!
- Oh! My God!
Sir, there was one taxi at that time...
Tell me...
This is the dead body...
Coming from the terrace...
Coming... Coming...
Coming... Coming... Fall down...
The dead body came
crashing down like this...
He fell dead, on that car...
That's all your honour...
What is he saying?
Doesn't he know English?
Call Mr. Veerakathy...
- Yes, Sir...
Mr. Veerakathy...
I am Veerakathy, (Brave Sword)...
Sir, I am Sathyan, (Promise)
Sir, Tamil Policemen have names like
'Walter Vetrivel' and 'Alex Pandian'...
You seem to have a queer name...
Tell me... What happened?
Sir, this is the dead body...
The dead body is
coming from the terrace...
It's coming... coming... coming...
The body is going, Sir...
It is fine; you can narrate in Tamil...
I am not kidding, Sir...
I am speaking the truth...
I was waiting for the customer...
I have not even collected my money...
It is 26 pounds...
If I were to convert
that to Indian currency,
it would be... 86x26 = 2236...
Who is that customer?
Where did you pick him up from?
Why are you grilling me
as if I am a Mafia Don...?
I am a Taxi driver;
Hundreds of people use my car each day...
Sir, I have to attend to a
customer in the evening...
I will gift your Police
Station with something small...
Please get me out of this Case...
Take his address and leave him...
Thank you, Sir...
Mr. Veerakathy, he is the
only suspect in the case,
Why did you let him go?
He's not the suspect;
he's just a witness, Allan...
So, are you saying it's a suicide?
Who is handling the Autopsy?
Please rise for Morning has broken...
Morning has broken,
like the first morning...
Blackbird has spoken,
like the first bird...
Praise for the singing...
Praise for the morning...
Morning has broken,
like the first morning...
Mr. Veerakathy... here's
Jordan's autopsy report...
It's a murder...
Excuse me...
- Yes...
How do you say this is a murder?
As per your Autopsy report,
what is the time of Jordan's death?
10:13 at night...
As per the evidence report...
...what's the time seen on the watch...
...after it fell from the top...?
10:25...
There's no chance the corpse would
have walked to its death, is there?
Doctor, you guys close the case
when you begin to suspect something...
We begin the case only
when we suspect something...
Tell me, dear...
Where are you, Dad? It's gonna start...
And Miss London 2012 is,
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam...
Who are you...?
Like a beautiful apparition...
You appear in front of
my eyes and then vanish...
As your feet touch the earth...
Flowers blossom there...
Like the moon...
You wander...
Casting shadows...
You create a storm...
With your black hair, you cast a web...
With your gaze, you kill me...
When she looks at the mirror,
It will say she is poetry...
And before anyone else can look at it,
it will cover itself...
The creator gathered
up a million flowers...
And pouring honey into each,
he created you...
She is an angel... With red lips...
With a glance,
She can raise the earth's temperature...
She is a sparkling star,
with a face like a lotus...
To one's eyes, she is an angel...
Who are you...?
Like a beautiful apparition...
You appear in front of
my eyes and then vanish...
As your feet touch the earth...
Flowers blossom there...
Like the moon... You wander
Casting shadows... You create a storm...
With your black hair, you cast a web...
With your gaze, you kill me...

best churches in London...
There's an old age home and
orphanage right next to it...
If we manage to take pictures here,
your social profile
will seem very impressive...
Will they give us
permission to take pictures...?
My sister is a
caretaker at the old age home...
I've taken permission saying we've are going to
do social service for an entire day... - Good!
Father, this is my brother,
Satish and Sarah...
Hello, everyone!

Turn that guy around...
Get him to turn around...
Is he getting angry? Turn him around!
Oh my god! It's him!
We're done for the day.
Be back tomorrow.
Father... Amen...
Get out!!
Kenny...
Kenny, are you alright?
Dilsha, get everybody out of here!
What are you guys doing?
You asked me
permission to do social service...
Not only are you
disrespecting a holy place,
you've pushed a
visually challenged man down...
Why on earth was I scared of this guy...!
I'm so sorry...
We were clicking some pictures
for a beauty pageant profile...
It was our fault...
I can't see the beauty
you are talking about...
In my eyes, neither your
people nor you are beautiful...
Hello, Sir... How are you?
Don't you recognize me?
It's me... I dropped you
at Leicester Square...
Do you know what happened that day?
There was a dead body that
dropped from the terrace...
Coming... Coming... Coming...
I fled in fear...
The Police took me for an enquiry...
Tell me, Sir... Will
murderers look like us?
Will they look like us?
I forgot to take money from
you amidst all that tension...
I forgot to take money from you, Sir...
I am trying to tell you
this as delicately as I can...
...and here you are
shying away from talking...
I need to go to Kent...
Golf and Country Club...
To Kent...?
40 miles...
The old dues plus new business...
Sir!!! It's a kill!!
Sir, why are you settling
dues now and sending me away?
I would have to head back alone...
Not just a corpse,
even if the building were to come
crashing down, I will not go away this time...
Finish up your work and come back...
I'll wait for you patiently...
All the best, Sir...
It's dark, be careful...
Peter...
Peter... Stop playing now...
I know it...
Who's that?
It's a Ghost!
Somebody help me! It's a Ghost!
Help!! Help me someone!
Sorry, I am waiting for a customer...
Good Morning Sir...
What is it, Sir...?
You've travelled this far...
Do you have any
relatives who stay close by...?
When did you come here?
- Last night...
It was very cold... Couldn't handle it...
That's why I pulled over to
a corner and went to sleep...
What were you doing all through night?
I was thinking about the
best drink to beat the cold...
Come on, Sir... I told you I
came here for a customer...
I am waiting for him...
Is that your customer?
- Is he here...?
What are you thinking, Sir?
Am I a taxi driver or
a Mortuary van driver?
You grab hold of me
whenever you find a dead body...
What were you doing there
in the middle of the night?
I was counting the
number of teeth an ant has...
How many times do I tell you?
I was waiting for a customer...
You gave me the same
answer even the last time...
You asked me the same
question even the last time...
Ask me different questions and
I will give you different answers...
Who is that customer?
The same man from the last time...
Did he have anything in his hands...?
You mean, like nail
polish or body paint...
Shut up! I meant weapons...
There was nothing like that...
How did he look?
He looks grumpy... Kind of like you...
How does the man look...?
Are you looking for a
match for your daughter?
You are asking so many
questions about him...
I told you...
- Wait... Sir, Please... Wait...
You, Idiot... he is
talking about his looks...
So, you are talking about
his physical appearance...
Why do you have to tie
me up to ask me this?
Let go of me and I will tell you...
A little bit to the right...
Right... Ok... Draw a circle... Here...
Turn it around... Ya... Ok! Perfect...
Where's the Head?
He must be busy at work...
I can't recall his
face however much I try...
I've seen him mostly in the dark...
I only remember the
clothes he was wearing...
I can tell you one thing for sure...
Even if you run a search on Google,
you won't to find a good boy like me...
I really don't know anything...
If you see him again or if
he gets in to your taxi again,
You must inform me immediately...
Ok?
- Sir...
Similarly, if you were to
see him or get any information...
let me know immediately...
He has taken my taxi twice
but has not paid me for it...
It's close to 150 pounds...
Convert that to our currency,
even if you multiply that by 86...
We will now sing Hymn number 661...
The Lord's my shepherd... I'll not want...
He makes me lie down in pastures green...
He leads me in quiet waters...
My sincere apologies, Father...
I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
My dear, it's not your fault... I know that...
- We understand... It's Ok...
Kenny...
I came to... I am sorry for...
I am so sorry...
This happened because of me...
If he has any friends or relatives,
ask them to come...
Dad, he doesn't have anyone...
He's an orphan...
- Oh!
All things bright and beautiful...
All creatures great and small...
All things wise and wonderful...
The lord god made them all...
Almighty God, please return Kenny to us...
Relieve him of his suffering and pain,
Let us enjoy his
wonderful music again... Amen...
As long as there is love, no
one in this world is an orphan...
Kenny, you are absolutely fine...
Can I go?
Greetings, Doctor!
You've changed the room...
I searched the whole hospital...
One can find the murderer,
but can't find you...
Hello, Mr. Veerakathy...
This is my daughter, Sarah...
Hi...
- Hi...
Sarah's friend, Kenny...
Hello! I am Veerakathy, (Brave sword)...
Hello!
Oh! Sorry... He can't see...
- Oh!
Ok, Kenny, see you later...
Ok, get well soon!
Mr. Veerakathy...
Please delete that photo...
Sorry, Sir...
He doesn't like being photographed...
I am sorry...
Thanks...
Mr. Veerakathy, just as we thought...
The death points are
affected in Cathy's body...
He is very intelligent...
He has made it difficult to tell
if it's a murder or a suicide...
What's his name...?
- Who?
Your daughter's friend...
- Kenny...
Kenny...
He looks grumpy... Kind of like you...
He doesn't laugh even
when you crack a joke...
I can't recall his
face however much I try...
I've seen him mostly in the dark...
I only remember the
clothes he was wearing...
Welcome back to the Church, Kenny...
Kenny, Sarah's such a wonderful person
You know, Sarah sings so well,
Kenny... We missed you...
Sarah's one of us now...
Sarah filled in for you the last 3 days...
I could give them
every other happiness...
But couldn't give them your music...
Will anyone walk blindfolded...?
Tell me, Kenny...
Thankfully, I was at home, else...
Who do we have to care for us?
All things bright and beautiful...
All creatures great and small...
All things wise and wonderful...
The lord god made them all...
We are not orphans, Dad...
Bye, This way... Get in...
Kenny, please take care of
Sarah... God Bless you my child...
Bye!!!
You are very beautiful...
You are very beautiful...
Will you be there, when I need you?
Will you be there, when I want you?
Oh, will you be there, I can feel you...
Oh, will you be there, I love you...
I became beautiful, because of you...
I became a woman, being close to you...
I am smitten by your smile...
And today, I am someone else...
Is this a painless illness...?
Are you the one who
inflicted this on me...?
Recalling the past is special...
But will what I hope for,
happen in the future...?
When your fingers... And my fingers touch...
I am drenched in love...
Will you be there, when I need you?
Will you be there, when I want you?
Oh, will you be there, I can feel you...
Oh, will you be there, I love you...
I became beautiful, because of you...
I became a woman, being close to you...
I am smitten by your smile...
And today, I am someone else...
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Born to an English mother
and a Tamil father,
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam is the first
Tamil girl to win the Ms. London title...
With this, she has made all
Tamilians worldwide, proud...
With her good conduct and finer qualities
she has further adorned Tamil Culture...
Kenny... Kenny...
Sarah told me you were coming...
I was expecting you...
The Function is this way...
Come with me...
The Tamil Association wishes
her for a great future ahead
and for winning the upcoming
Ms. England pageant...
We now present to you,
Ms. Sarah Vinayakam...
She will address the gathering...
Greetings to everyone...
Though I was born in Britain,
I must thank my father for
raising me as a Tamil girl...
He taught me Tamil
culture and tradition...
Even though Tamilians are spread
across Srilanka, Malaysia, Singapore
and other places, it is
Tamil that unites us...
Everyone thinks you are going to win
the upcoming Ms. England pageant...
What do you have to say about that?
I must thank people who think that...
If you become Ms. England, what
would you set your eyes on next...?
Would it be social service or would
it be Beauty pageants and Fashion...?
My vision...
The most awful thing in the world
is the inability to see...
I would like to be the light in the life
of a person who is unable to see...
Can you tell us who that person is...?
His name is Kenny...
He is right here...
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, please...
Please... just listen...
I have not taken this decision
out of sympathy for you...
I truly...
Hey, you, listen...
I want you out of this competition...
Get your hands off me...
My girlfriend is going
to win... You will lose...
I said get your hands off me!
Where did you get this attitude from...?
Is it because you are beautiful...
or is it because of your boyfriend...?
Talk to me... Don't touch him!
Oh! If I touch him, you get angry?
What you can do...?
Kenny, go away...
He's Blind... do you get that...?
Why don't you leave him?
Do you see now...?
See what is going to happen to him!!
Rip him off!
What will you do?
- Please go, Kenny...
I understand everything now...
You are just like the
Policemen back home...
If you can't find the real culprit,
You find some innocent guy
and heap charges on him...
You have a strong
connection with the murders,
Tell us the truth... Who is it?
Please come, Sir... Look
at what is happening...
They've spared the villain but
are grilling the clown instead...
I am harmless...
I told you even then that
I don't know anything...
Sir, give me some time...
If we thrash him a few times,
he will be out with the truth...
Even if you thrash him several times,
you will not get anything out of him.
Sir, this guy seems kinder; You
want me beaten several times...
Go to Benedict Hospital...
Dr. Vinayakam will handover a Report...
All the murders look similar...
It must be the same person...
Who is the culprit...?
Why would he do it...?
What is the motive...
And target...
The most awful thing in the
world is the inability to see...
The purpose of the Eye Research Foundation
is to bring light in to their lives...
Sir... There's no one here, Sir...
Shoot him, lmran!
I am not lmran...
Shivakumar,
Indian Police Service...
Welcome, Ravichandran...
You've upheld our Pride...
Shivakumar's intelligence
and valour during Operation
Night Rose, has saved the
country from great danger...
You've risked your life
with terrorists for 2 years...
...and have reinforced the
faith people have in our reign...
Best of luck!
Ya, you are right...
Hey!
- Welcome back, Sir...
Good show sir!
Sir...
- Yes...
It looks like an Invitation...
As I am back, people home
are probably inviting me
for some small function...
It's no small function...
It's a wedding...
A wedding...? When is it?
In 2 days...
Who is getting married?
Shivakumar... son of Nachiappan weds...
It's the Stop for Chokkanathapuram!!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!!
Has the Bridegroom not come...?
I am the Groom... Where's the Girl?
Why are you giving me a cheeky answer?
Go away!
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!! Bridegroom!
Who is the Bridegroom?
What's new?
I've always called you that...
And now, you are getting married...
Who said I am going to get married?
It's my sister who told me...
She asked me to fetch you...
I came to get a car for the
Reception and fetch you along the way...
But, you are speeding away...
This Wedding will not happen...
Bridegroom!!
Hey, start the car...
Bridegroom! Bridegroom!!
It will take 45 minutes
to walk the distance...
If we take the car, we can
rush there in 30 minutes...
Stop calling me "Bridegroom"...
Fine, Bridegroom...
I will not... call you "Bridegroom"...
Come on... Let's go by car...
I'll whack you...
I asked him to fetch the Groom,
but here he is, bringing
the entire village along...
Uncle Thambi is no ordinary man!
Welcome, Bridegroom
- Freshen up and we'll eat...
What's happening here, Mom?
- A wedding...
The bride's people
will be here, hurry up...
Who gave you a go ahead for this?
Who should I ask?
Stop that... Grate the coconut!
You should ask me!
- What?
What is that?
- Fruits...
Keep it there...
You should check with
me about the wedding...
We are getting it done...
Why should I ask you...?
Muruga... That should go
to the wedding hall...
Where are you keeping it?
- Mom...
Take it to the wedding hall...
- Mom, I am talking to you...
What is it? Whenever I ask you
about it, you always dodge me...
Do you know how old you are?
There's a time for everything...
That is why we took a call on this...
Mom, I've not even seen this girl...
No one asked me if I like her...
Did your grandfather see me
before getting married to me?
I don't want to repeat his mistake...
What is it now?
You want to see the girl, is that all?
Here's the photo...
I am saying I don't want a wedding
and here you are giving me a photo...
Why are you saying you
don't want to get married?
Why don't any of you understand me?
My job is a very risky one...
I don't even know where I will be...
A marriage is the last thing I need...
How long will you say this?
Your grand dad gave up his life
during the Freedom Struggle...
Your dad, in the Kargil War...
Did they not know
how things would be...?
That didn't mean we did not
marry nor have children...
Do you get married
only to have children?
Of course, don't you need an heir?
That is when you can send them to
serve the country, if the need arises...
This is the last time
I am going to ask you.
Do you want to see the
girl's picture before the wedding?
What are you doing here?
Aren't we getting late?
The girl's family is on
their way... hurry up...
Tell him that...
Bride... I won't say it...
Hurry up and get ready...
The wedding formalities have to begin...
Hey, Senthil...
- Yes, Sir...
Where will Uncle "Thappachey" be?
That is wrong...
I can't play around with an
innocent village girl's life
just because they want
me to get married...
What do you want to do?
You are one of the senior members of the
family and a village leader as well...
You should try and explain
it to the girl's family...
What should I say...?
Tell them about my work.
The risk involved...
When I head to work, I don't
even know when I am getting back...
I cannot meet any of the
expectations a regular girl will have...
I want to tell them about
all this before the wedding...
It's wrong...
- What is?
It is wrong if you
don't tell them all this...
Don't get anxious, see what happens...
Welcome, Uncle...
Come in, Uncle...
Hey, Subbaiah!!
I told you not to leave the door open;
Else, unrequired people would
step in... You don't listen...
They are already here...
You are keeping wrong company,
which is why you are saying
all the wrong things... Bride...
I won't say it...
It's wrong...
Where have you been?
The girl's family is here...
Have they come?
Note down everything...
don't blame others...
Come on, Bridegroom!
Then...
- Where are they?
Hey! Look who is here... Welcome!
Please come...
- Welcome...
Who are you looking at?
I am talking to you...
Happy to see you...
Do you know who he is?
He is a senior member of the family,
an advisor to the entire village...
He may not come across like that...
Well! I was told you
would be here tomorrow...
But you are here today,
anyway, happy to see you...
Why are you looking at me like that?
I am the girl's father...
This is my older brother...
This is my younger brother...
Don't just keep looking...
Serve him some sweets... - Ok sir.
Please come... let's eat some sweets...
What sweets are they?
- Milk sweets... - Milk sweets?
What are you looking at?
If anything were to go
wrong in this wedding,
we knew that would happen only
because of Uncle "Thappachey"...
That is why we
forewarned the Girl's family...
Well...
And this man claims to
be a Village leader!!!
Who is the Village leader?
It's been 2 years since he
was kicked out of that role...
No one respects him in the village...
And you choose to seek his help...
Milk sweets are enough
to keep him quiet...
Oh my!! Why are you doing all this?
- That is fine...
This is Meenakshi's mother...
This is my brother's wife...
Please come, sit down...
Why are you resting here,
there is a lot of wedding
work to do... let's go...
Sit down...
Will you agree to
everything everyone says? - No...
What happened?
What else do I say...?
Ever since my son was a child,
you've called him the Bridegroom
and he has nurtured dreams
of marrying your daughter...
Now, you are getting her
married to someone else
and expect us to join the festivity...
Don't we have any shame...?
What is it, Bridegroom?
No one should utter
the word "Bridegroom"
I spoke about him...
Let me see you...
This guy...? Go ahead!!
Are you from the
Groom's family or the Girl's?
The Groom's house...
How are you related to the Groom?
The Groom does not want the wedding...
Who are you?
I am the Groom...
My daughter's
wedding has been stalled...
Who will marry her now?
Uncle, I am there...
- Hey...
Excuse me...
Can you help me?
- What is it?
I want to talk to the girl's parents
or the elders in her family...
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!
The Groom wants to talk
to the girl's family!!
That is unacceptable...
- Please keep quiet...
Who said that...?
Please wait!!
Why are all of you having
such heated discussions?
This is something we
don't do in this family...
The elders in the family have
already discussed everything...
What does it mean when the Groom...
...wants to talk to the girl's family
a day before the wedding?
It's wrong...
What is wrong...?
It's wrong to have let you inside...
I think you have instigated everyone...
You...
- Wait...
Is that the problem...? Wait...
Come here...
- Mom
Come on...
- Mom...
This is the Girl's family...
The Aunts, Uncles and others...
And this is the girl's sister...
Greet everyone...
- Hi!
What are all of you looking at?
Greet him...
Hello!
He has not met any of you before this...
He just wanted to meet everyone...
Why are all you having a
heated discussion for this...?
Now that you have seen him, please get
going... We're running out of time...
Is this all?
It's only when you give us a clear
explanation like this, will we understand...
Come on... Get going...
- Mom...
Get the flowers ready...
Check out the arrangements
at the wedding hall...
Why are you keeping it there?
- I won't say it...
Come on...
- Mom...
You... What is this mom...?
I am your mother...
your tricks will not work with me...
Change your clothes and
get ready for the function...
Please come...
Muruga... Serve Coffee to the guests...
I've said whatever has to be said...
there's nothing...
Don't rush to any
conclusion like that...
Who else is left to talk to?
There is someone...
Who?
- The Bride...
That's a good sign...
Say you don't want the wedding;
I'll take care of everything else...
That is Meena...
Come on... Let's go on to the
other side and talk to her...
She's crazy...
She's not holding the
Umbrella for herself...
My dear...
Let's go and talk to her...
That's wrong...
The head and heart's
dizzy and undecided...
It's raining...
Let's leave...
Come on... Let's go...
Come...
Mic testing... 1, 2, 1, 2
Hey... what's happening...?
Pump up the volume!!!
Bride... Oh! No...
I won't call you that...
No, it's fine...
you can call me that...
No... I won't...
- Just a moment...
Oh, beautiful flower...
Earth shattering beauty...
Dark eyed beauty...
Beauty which melts the heart...
I have always been a
free bird... Flying high...
You have trapped me... completely,
oh, woman...
There he comes in a big procession...
For the auspicious occasion...
Bearing gifts, he comes...
Buy wedding finery for
the groom you've trapped...
Once the wedding rituals
are over, break into a song...
The moon that was
beautiful till yesterday...
Seems dull compared to you today...
The moon that appears tomorrow...
Will become the honeymoon for sure...
Unspoken happiness...
Silently sweeps me off my feet...
A wicked heaviness...
Quietly pinches my heart...
Hey, baby... Come near me...
And take my dreams with you!
Adorn the bride and groom with flowers...
Bless the newly wedded couple
with a good life and eternal bliss...
Adorn the bride and groom with flowers...
Bless the newly wedded couple
with a good life and eternal bliss...
The doors of my heart
were locked until now...
But I am struck by love... I am struck...
My feet which have treaded battlefields...
Will now approach
Flower shops, oh, woman!
My mind scolds me without respect!
My tongue screams your name,
without respite!
Hey, baby... Come near me...
And take my dreams with you!
There he comes in a big procession...
For the auspicious occasion,
bearing gifts, he comes...
Buy wedding finery for
the groom you've trapped...
Once the wedding rituals
are over... Break into a song...
Oh, beautiful flower...
Earth shattering beauty...
Dark eyed beauty...
Beauty which melts the heart...
I have always been a
free bird... Flying high...
You have trapped me... completely,
oh, woman...
The head and heart's
dizzy and undecided...
I was scared you would say
something silly and stop the wedding...
No one let me say anything then;
I am going to speak to her directly...
Oh my god! Please don't, brother...
Whatever it is,
speak to her in the morning...
The wedding night comes
only once in a life time...
Don't say something and mess things up...
Abi...
For starts, you need to see a girl...
One must like her...
Say "I love you" to her...
And only then come formalities like
the wedding, the wedding night etc.,
It's happening in reverse in my case...
What are you going to do now?
I need to talk to you...
About myself...
- About you...?
About my work...
- Your work...?
I have no control over my hours of work...
I can't meet any
expectations of an average man...
What work do you have at the village?
Who is from the village?
- Aren't you from here?
Who told you that?
I am coming back here after 10 years...
Are you educated?
- Am I educated?!
Hello... Excuse me...
I am an Eye Doctor...
Doctor...!?
- Ya...
My dream is to build a big
eye research foundation in India...
Where do you work?
Where do you work as a Doctor?
At Delhi...
- At Delhi...?
I agreed to this wedding
only because you are from Delhi...
Aren't you from Delhi?
Huh?
- Aren't you from Delhi?
Yes...
I was told you work as a Policeman...
Are you a Sub Inspector (SI)
or an Inspector?
I...
- Are you an SI...!?
Don't worry...
The Delhi Police Commissioner
is my patient...
He's from our hometown...
I will tell him and get you an
Inspector's posting... Is that ok?
Actually, coming to the point...
You might have had a lot of
dreams about your wife to be...
I had dreams too...
According to me,
you need to meet someone...
Become friends... Fall in love...
Get married...
And only then comes the wedding night...
However, for us... But, it's ok...
We have met now,
let's try becoming friends...
The rest will come later...
Ok...?
This is a village...
Let our Deal remain between us...
I shouldn't call him the Bridegroom,
but he will act like one for sure...
I was really worried
about what would happen!!
Shiva...
- Yes, Mom...
Why are you standing there,
wasting time?
Have a bath and get ready...
We need to go to Meenakshi's house...
They have come to take us there... - Yes...
Hi!
Please come, Son-in-law...
I couldn't speak to you amidst the
hustle and bustle of the wedding...
I worked with the Air Force...
That became my life...
I was transferred to a
different place every 3 years...
Serve the elders first...
- Ok...
When Meena studied medicine,
all of us were at Delhi...
I retired after that and shifted
to Thirupathur with the family...
Meena stayed back there...
Please sit down and take rest...
This is Meena's room...
Please check on what he wants...
What are you looking at?
Nice paintings... Where did you buy them?
Where did we buy them?!
My sister painted these
while in school... It's Modern Art...
She like's the works of MF Hussain,
Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Ravi Varma...
Well! Do you know
anything about paintings?
No...
Did your sister write these
books while she was in School?
Are you mocking?
Tolstoy! Does she like Tolstoy?
Does she like Tolstoy?!
My sister likes Tolstoy,
Charles Dickens,
Paulo Coelho and
Dan Brown's books a lot...
She doesn't go to sleep without reading...
Do you read?
If I need to fall asleep, I read...
It's going to be tough!
She loves music...
Are you interested in music?
Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky...
Do you know any of these people...?
Have you atleast heard their music...?
Well!!
Did you see my
daughter-in-law play the piano so well?
Look at how modest she is in
spite of all the talent she has...
Why would you hesitate to marry her?
Be happy atleast now...
You played the piano very well...
- Thanks...
You have a bright future in music...
But, music is not my dream...
Eye Research Foundation...
The most awful thing in the
world is not being able to see...
The aim of my Eye Research Foundation is
to bring light in to the lives
of people living in darkness...
Do you know music?
I do...
But since I am interested in
painting now, I've let go of music...
Really...?
What kind of paintings do you like?
Picasso, Da Vinci...
Oh God! Even I like them...
Is that so? That's a surprise...
In fact,
I became interested in
paintings only because of books...
Books... Do you read books?
- Yes...
Who are the Authors you read?
Tolstoy, Paulo Coelho...
Daniel...
Journals...
Magazines...
This guy!
Sir... here's the
Murderer you are looking for...
You have let him go and
have kept me locked up...
Mr. Veerakathy... The Kenny you
are talking about cannot see...
I never said he can see...
I only said he is a murderer...
He needs people to help
him even to cross the road...
How can you call him a murderer?
He needs help only to cross the road...
not to murder someone...
Kenny is an innocent guy...
He earns a living by
playing the Piano at Church...
Which Church?
Kenny doesn't live here...
Then, where?
I don't know...
He comes here in the morning
and leaves in the evening...
How long has Kenny been here?
About 6 months...
How do you know him?
Kenny was referred to
us by the Blind school...
Oh... Sorry!
Whoa! Be careful, there's water here...
You guys aren't my
students... How can I help you?
May I know who is running this place?
That would be me... I am Daniel Kish...
Oh! Can I talk to you for a few minutes?
Give me 5 minutes...
I'll finish the
session and join you guys...
Echolocation...
What does that mean?
A Bat, though it
can't see, makes a sound
and with the help of
an echo coming from it,
identifies people and objects around...
They are just like that...
They do not require anyone's help...
Even if things are
1000 feet away from them,
they can sense it accurately...
Their ears are their eyes...
Yes, Kenny is totally blind...
He lost his eyes in an
accident a year ago...
He was referred to us by... UC...
Yes, it was UCLH Hospital...
Who brought Kenny to you?
He originally came with his wife...
Can you tell me in what kind of
an accident Kenny lost his sight?
Yes, it was the 2011 Serial bomb blast...
He survived the Tower Bridge Assault...
Is there another Kenny?
No Sir... he's the only one...
Scan this photo immediately,
Find out who he is
through Face Identification...
What happened, Sir...?
The original name of the Kenny
we are looking for is, Shiva...
Not only is he the Death touch Murderer,
He is the prime person behind the 1-11 serial
bomb blasts that shook up this country...
He is a Terrorist...
Hello...
Sarah...
Victor, April 5, 4pm...
April 5 is today...
Taxi!!
Where do you want to go?
Chelsea...
- Chelsea?
You are that Murderer's...
Oh my God! It's you! Please get off...
I am trying to run away from my
troubles and fresh ones are chasing me...
Please get down... Get down!
Please, I need to go there urgently...
If it's that urgent,
You can lie that you're having a
heart attack and take an Ambulance...
I have enough troubles already,
please... get down...
Please, I'll pay you a double fare...
Double Fare...?
Sarah...
- Dad...
The Murderer's Mobile...
34 Pounds, please...
Hey!!! Hey!!!
Hello!!! Hello!!! Excuse me... Hello!!
Hey!
Let him go!
Leave him!
What are you doing
without giving me the money...?
Hey listen... You can't escape...
The Police are here... Don't move!
Oh, my God!! The Police!!
They will let him go
but get me instead!!!
Hey...
- Hey...
Stop there!
- Hello...
God!! Police!!!
Cops!!!
Hey! Hey! Hey! It's my car! Oh my God!
You can't escape!!!
Hey catch him!!!!
- The Police had surrounded you!
Hey...
- Stop the car!
Oh, my god!
Cops!
Sir, careful...
Sarah...
Can't you see?
Victor...
The owner of several million
pounds worth, Skyway Steel Factory...
What were you doing at your
corporate office all by yourself,
on the day of the incident?
Because it was a Saturday,
everyone left by afternoon...
That is why I was by myself...
Have you seen that murderer before?
This is the first time...
Why should he come to murder you?
What else, but, money?
What makes you say that?
Everyone he has killed has
been a multi millionaire...
Do you know any one of
them who's been killed?
I don't know any of them, Sir...
Then, how do you say for sure
that he killed them only for money...?
Well... The Papers... Media...
- Excuse me, Sir...
They found the car on
the Greenwich Bridge,
but the 3 people are missing...
It's all gone...
My Taxi has been washed away...
After all that he has done,
look at him, relaxing...
Shouldn't wait here any longer...
Very dangerous...
Help!!
Help!!
There's a car coming... Hang on...
Help!!
- Hello please...
Actually...
Lift, please... Help...
Are you a Tamilian?
Thank God! Mam, are you a Tamilian?
We are stuck with a murderer...
Please help us... Please take us...
Ok... Ok... Ok... Relax... Relax...
- Thank you!
Come in...
This way...
This looks like a Haunted house...
Is he your husband?
Hello, Sir...
Oh, my God! That's the Devil himself...
Hurry up!
Oh, my God! Where do we run...?
Let's go this way...
Help!!
Another girl's screaming...
Come, here is another way...
- That's an echo...
Help!!
Help!
No point screaming...
You won't find a soul
for the next 8 miles...
Thought you were a beautiful model,
but you are a Thug hanging
around with a murderer...
Who are you? Let us go...
Who is a murderer?
Do you know who he is?
Do you know what happened to him?
You said he was an SI
but he has a fancy car...
He probably takes bribes...
The early morning flowers...
Yearn to see you...
The evening clouds...
Rest as they watch you...
Is the Wedding over...
- Yes...
You seem very happy...
This is Seethama...
I don't miss my Mom so
much because she's here...
It is your eyes that
the stars search for...
To live with you... is a boon!
You bring dreams...
You bring poetry...
You bring relationships... into my life...
The ace Nuclear Scientist of
our country... Mr. Ravi Mugra...
He was killed mysteriously last week...
Isn't this a Police Case...?
He had developed special
weapon for our Military forces...
The Flow Chart with
the Formula was with him...
That Flow Chart is missing...
And, you were missing here...
I took charge of the Case...
It's a big case... Do well, Sharath...
Thanks, buddy...
Sharath...
He is the only friend, family,
philosopher, guide I have here in Delhi...
That's not true...
We are close buddies working
in the same department,
holding similar positions...
In which Police Station
do you work in, as an SI...?
The Mugra IV is a special weapon...
Made of 4 parts...
Each part is 3 centimeters...
You can impose it anywhere...
Dust bin... Post Box... Brief Case...
No Metal Detector can detect it...
If this goes off,
the blast radius is 50 meters...
And the worst part is...
If you get the Flow Chart, it
takes just 4 hours to assemble...
This is very dangerous...
Ok...
You can count on me for any
help you need in this case...
Ok...?
Where are you going?
Piano Class...
- Piano...? - Ya...
Play it...
The Piano...
The Harmonium first...
The Piano comes a year later... Play it...
Hey! Not like that...
Like this! Play it...
I was sitting downstairs
while I heard a voice from above...
Which window was it...?
Tell me...
- Hi! Are you busy?
What is it?
Can you come to Connaught
Place right away? Tagore Gallery...
I am a little busy, I can't come now...
No, you have to come...
No... I am attending an important case...
This is important too...
Sorry, I can't come...
Sorry, Meena, I'll be waiting for you...
I said I am busy, can't you understand...?
This is why I didn't
want to get married...
Please give me my space...
How is he now, Doctor...?
- Nothing to worry...
You've done a great job, Dr. Meenakshi...
You've proven yourself once again...
Thank you, Doctor...
- Good...
You have to thank Dr. Meenakshi...
Doctor, Thank you...
You've been of great help...
The Patient's wife...
I have nothing to give you, keep this...
This is all I have right now...
You have to accept this as
a token of my Gratitude...
Tagore Gallery...?
We are closed for the day...
Please come back tomorrow morning...
Is Shivakumar...?
- Are you a Tamilian?
Mr. Shivakumar has left...
What happened here?
There was a painting Exhibition...
It was for "Meenakshi
Eye Research Foundation"...
They are raising funds through this...
Mr. Shivakumar had
arranged this exhibition...
The Minister inaugurated it...
Can I take a look?
Everything has been sold...
Only that Modern Art painting's left...
Mr. Shivakumar refused
to sell it at any cost...
Sorry, I didn't call you to disturb you...
There were many important people...
Friends...?
"See" her...
"Like" her...
"Marry" her...
Now..."Friends" with her...
"Love"...
Sir... No, Sir...
Sir... but...
Sure, Sir...
The Investigations,
Enquiries and Verifications are over...
We've checked the details of
everyone with a criminal record...
No leads yet...
In a 1.2 Billion
population across India,
how can we question anyone
without proper evidence?
What if he is not an Indian...?
Why can't he be a terrorist
or a spy from another country?
That's a good point...
List out the foreigners who have
visited India in the last 6 months...
Identify the people
who have not returned...
We will definitely find a clue...
What if he has left the country already?
No, he hasn't...
Had he gone, the bomb
would have gone off...
Play it...
Hey! Not like that...
Play it...
Like that...
Play it... Play it...
It's my birthday today...
If my parents were here,
I would have taken their blessings...
Since, they aren't... I am...
Anything else...?
Hello...
- Hi...
Tell me...
- Are you done with work?
I just got done... I am leaving...
Can we go out for dinner?
I am very tired... Can we go another day?
Well...
I have booked a table... Can we...?
It's already late...
By the time we meet and then...
We've met...
Shall we...?
I didn't notice it...
Please do...
Sir, you've come?
- Ya...
Me...
Meena...
We are waiting for you, Sir...
Everything is ready... Please come...
Everything is ready, isn't it...?
They've come... - Sorry!
You have to take care of
everything personally...
Sir... Sir... Sir...
I love you...
I love you...
I love you...
I love you...
I love you...
Good night...
One minute...
What is it...?
- I...
I...
I... Happy Birthday...
How did you know...?
Friends...?
Thanks...
What's that...?
- What...?
What's in your hand...?
- Nothing...
Show me what that is...
- That's... Sorry...
Hello...
Ganshyam, the Manager
from the Park Hotel...
Oh... one second...
You left just like that...
I cancelled all my
reservations for you... - No... Uh!
Am going to lose my job over this...
I am sorry... I am sorry...
You have to come back right now...
Right now!
I am sorry!
Sharath, we can't call 1426 foreigners
for an enquiry without evidence...
That will lead to a big problem...
It will also affect our
International relations...
The Home Minister
will not agree to this...
Why should we ask the Minister?
What are you saying?
- Well...
If a bomb goes off tomorrow,
they will blame us for
incorrect Intelligence reports...
And walk away,
safeguarding their ministry...
What do you suggest...?
Sir...
Give us permission to
investigate the 1426 foreigners...
I will find the Flow Chart in a week...
Shivakumar...
Sir... - The Prime Minister
is leaving to China tomorrow...
Please check if all
the details are in place...
This is very urgent...
All details should be there
on my table within an hour...
Yes, Sir...
- Okay!
Hello...
Are you busy...?
No...
Can you come to No: 40, Lodhi Gardens...?
Good night sir!
- What's happening there?
Oh! Do I need to give you all
the details for you to come...?
No...
Shiva...
Hey...
Can I ask you now... What's...?
It's my Chief Doctor's
Wedding Anniversary...
Me... at the Doctor's party...
It's not the host we
need to worry about...
It's the guests I want you to meet...
Who is...?
The Police Commissioner of Delhi...
Commissioner...
I called you to talk
about your promotion...
Promotion...?
- Ya...
No, you don't have to...
Shiva...
What happened...?
The Commissioner... I am going home...
Are you scared of the Commissioner...?
He is my patient...
Why worry when I am here... Come...
He's here... Come on...
It's been 25 years...
Excuse me, Sir...
Hello, Doctor...
- He's...
He's my...
- Sir...
I didn't get any
information about you coming here...
Sir, is everything ok, Sir...?
I have come here informally...
Oh! That's great, Sir...
Sir... One moment, if you don't mind...
Sir... Could you speak to the
Minister about my DIG promotion...?
Yes... I am talking about it...
Why is the Commissioner
calling the SI, "Sir"...?
Sub Inspector...?
He is one of the top 5
Intelligence Officers in the country...
The Research and Analysis Wing...
He is a very
influential Officer in India...
According to me, you
need to meet someone...
Become friends...
Fall in love... Get married...
But, it's ok...
We have met now, let's
try becoming friends...
The rest will come later... ok...?
"You" means me...
"l" means us...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
Looking at each other as we separate...
To be united, we patiently wait...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
The latch is open and yet we wait...
For the wind to blow
and unite us forever...
"You" means me...
"l" means us...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
He was our only son...
He died 5 years back...
Because of a Brain Tumor...
He would have died at Child Birth...
Had to remove Asha's
Uterus to save him...
But, we were still unlucky...
We try hard to console ourselves...
But, a child is truly precious...
When night falls,
the fear of theft
brings the doors together...
The doors themselves will steal...
Love will make them
perform this miracle...
Both joined hands and came together...
Making the imaginary locks disappear...
The doorway shudders, struggles,
celebrates!
Where are we going...?
To your favorite place...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
There was thunder, lightning and rain...
And yet, we stood firm and unshaken...
But how is it that we
came together, today...
Just with our gentle breaths,
I wonder...
Our hearts have become one today...
Now, there are no doors in the way...
From now on and forever more,
Only fragrant breeze in
our abode shall blow...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
Looking at each other as we separate...
To be united, we patiently wait...
One half of the door is you...
The other half is me...
The latch is open and yet we wait...
For the wind to blow
and unite us forever...
"You" means me...
"l" means us...
Isn't it weird...?
Everyone, but Mumtaz knew how
much Shah Jahan loved her...
...Except one!
" Mumtaz "
After that I never entered a
Chinese Restaurant... - Ya...?
Hello...
Where?
Stay there... I'm on my way...
What happened...?
We were right about our suspicion...
There is a foreigner who is
staying next to Jamma Masjid...
I'll have to go...
I'll come too...
No, No... You guys carry on...
Why don't you leave after dinner...?
No... I'll come back and
join you if possible... ok...?
Shiva, in case it gets late,
please drop Asha home...
Ok...
- Sorry, guys...
Sir...
Where is he...?
Shall we leave...?
- Ya...
Come...
What happened...?
Why are you tense...?
Sharath is not attending the call...
Is Sharath attending the call...?
No...
Mr. Shivakumar...
Yes, Sir...
Where is Sharath...?
He has gone in for an Enquiry...
He hasn't come back yet...
Which house is it...?
3rd Street, Number 14...
Hey! Hey! shiva, catch him!
Hey... hey...
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun!
Drop it!
Bad luck, brother!
If Sharath hadn't shot him...
I am scared...
Why are you getting
worked up for this...?
As a Doctor, you would have
seen more blood loss and pain...
It didn't hurt me then...
It does now...
Sir,
...the dead man's name, as
per his passport is, Steven...
But, that need not be his real name...
He is surely here to
spy on our country...
If you hand this case over to me,
I can investigate it further...
- This is Sharath's case...
Sir...
- You may go now...
Hello...
Shivakumar had come here...
- Yes, Sir...
He explained the case to me...
He says this couldn't have gone wrong,
unless someone in your
department is hand in glove...
Tell Shivakumar to find
out who that person is...
...and ensure that our
Ministry doesn't get a bad name...
Yes, Sir...
Thank you, Sir...
Thanks, Bro...
If you weren't there,
I cannot imagine...
I've taken charge of the Case...
Within 2 days we'll find
out about the Flow Chart...
and about who is responsible for this...
Are a lot of people involved in this...?
We'll get to know if
other people are involved...
...or whether it's our people
doing this behind our backs...
Where are the clothes
Steven was wearing that day...?
In the locker room, Sir...
How are you confident...
...that it's the Flow Chart
that was sent by cargo...?
The weight of the cargo was 5.5 grams...
Only a pen drive normally
weighs around 5 to 6 grams...
What if he had sent the
Flow Chart in a pen drive...?
I think you are imagining things...
I am not imagining, Sir...
That cargo is being sent to a
British Intelligence Officer...
Then, we should inform
the British Intelligence...
That is not possible, Sir...
This is our military secret...
If they get to know we were working
on such a weapon of mass destruction,
We will face several problems
including economic sanctions...
So...?
I've checked...
The cargo will reach in 4 days...
If you permit me,
I can go to London and stop the
parcel from being delivered...
I'll have to permit you;
else the Minister will call me...
Meena... Meena... What happened...?
Shiva is going to London...
He'll take 4 days to return...
- So, what...?
Shiva's birthday is on
the 1st ofJanuary...
He'll be back by then...
Why are you getting
tense unnecessarily...?
This was my Mission...
You are risking your life
and doing this instead of me...
You were the one who
gave my life back to me...
If you need anything, let me know...
Careful...
I' am leaving, Asha... Take Care...
- Bye, Bro...
Be good...
I'll take your leave, Sir...
Just as much as a British
Intelligence Officer is a spy here,
You will also be a spy,
when you go there...
You could meet the same fate...
Take care...
All the best...
Mr. Kenny, a retired IPS Officer,
will receive you in London...
He was Mr. Ravichandran's Trainee...
He gave up his job for the
girl he loved and settled there...
Kenny will be with you
through this Operation...
Shivakumar...?
Arjun Rathore...
Mr. Ravichandran has told me...
...not to use my car until
this operation is through...
Thanks Mate! That'll be all...
Kenny! Gita left the house keys...
Oh! Thanks...
Who is he...?
He looks a bit like you...
Your brother...?
No, he's a friend from India...
Richard Ford...
- Arjun Rathore...
Kenny...
Kenn... y...
Oh... Sorry... I...
- Hey, Gita...
He looks just like you...
You're saying that too!
This is my wife...
Hi!
- HI!
This is the Cargo office
you are looking for...
Highly secured...
It is impossible to get in
and retrieve a parcel...
Can I take your order, please...?
2 Cappuccinos...
- Sure...
Shiva, I know this girl...
She visits the Pub at our Hotel...
What is she doing here...?
Excuse me...
Is she working with FEDEX...?
Yes, Sir...
she is a FEDEX dispatch officer...
- Oh!
Come on, Sunny! Push it! You can do it!!
Push it!
- You can do it!!
Come on, Sunny!
- Push!
Sorry! You lost it!
Well!
Hard luck, Honey...
What's this for...?
It's for your train back home...
Can I play for you...?
I'll tell you what, you bet that pound
and I bet everything I've won tonight,
that he beat you...
Go!
Go... Go... Push him!
Go! Come on, Man!! Push him!
Come on! Push him out!
Go!
- Yes!! Push him out, now! -Yes!
Yes!
- The money is all yours!
Thank you!
- Hey! - Get lost!
This is for your train back home!
It's such a great day...
I can't thank you
enough for this help...
I need your help too...
From what Andrea says,
our cargo will reach the
warehouse by this evening...
Hence, the Operation
has to happen today...
It's not that easy...
They have 8 surveillance cameras
outside and 24 of them inside...
We need to freeze those cameras...
We need a hacker...
When do you want this to be done...?
- Today...
It'll cost you 10,000 pounds...
The cameras have to freeze
at 10 o'clock tonight...
They will...
This is the plan of our Operation...
All shops at Battersea
Square wind up at 9pm...
Except for this Coffee Shop...
You'll have to wait here...
Hello, Sir... Cappuccino
again or something else...
Cappuccino...
Andrea will wait for you at the Back
entrance of the Cargo Office at 9:45...
I am ready... I am here...
- Ya...
After that,
Victor will crash the server
exactly at 10pm and freeze the camera...
Get ready... 3... 2... 1...
System crashed... All Cameras frozen...
The Police will receive information
within 5 minutes of
the camera freezing...
It will take them 10
minutes to get there...
Hence, this Operation will
have to get done in 9 minutes...
Come! Come! Quickly!
Come on! Quick!
Come on!
This way...
What's the Address...?
- St. James Square...
St. James Square... East London... lt's here...
It says "SW21 "...
Quick!
We have time!! Relax!
The Cops are coming...
- What?
They are coming now! Quick!
Quick!
- Ya! Just a second...
I got to go!! I Sorry, I got to go!!
Andrea, Wait!
- Sorry!
Wait a second... Where
are you going...? Andrea!
You two, search him thoroughly...
Ok... Fine...
Moving out in 10 minutes,
we've got him...
At 10:05, when the Operation is over,
when you finish, Richard Ford will be
waiting for you at the Back Entrance...
I'll pick you up... No worries...
Just take your time...
I'll wait for you...
If you give me permission,
I can go to London and
bring back the parcel...
Just as much as a British
Intelligence Officer is a spy here,
You will also be a spy,
when you go there...
Take care...
3... 2... 1...
Excuse me, Can I help you...?
Kenny...?
Kenny...? There's no
one here called Kenny...
Kenny, his wife Gita...
I stayed with them
for a couple of days...
What's going on here?
He is asking about Kenny...
There's no Kenny here...
I was staying with them...
I think I have to ask you to leave...
I'm terribly sorry...
But... I am... Excuse me...
Richard Ford... There's no
Richard Ford... She is my Boss...
She owns the shop...
Hey, Man! This is a Car Rental...
A hundred people come and go in a day...
There's no Richard here, you know...
The cameras have to freeze...
- They will...
I'll pick you up... No worries...
I am sorry... I can't do this...
I've got to go!! I am sorry!
I've got to go!
Our operation will have
to be done in 9 minutes...
The Cops are coming... They
are coming now! Quick!
Hey! You! Stay there!
Hey! Stop there!
Hey!!
Male, 5'4", heading
towards Trafalgar Square...
riding a Black BMX bike,
wearing a Black leather
jacket and Khaki trousers...
Male, 5'4", making his
way down the steps...
Forgive me, Shiva...
I knew you would come here...
...and that these things would happen...
Who gave you instructions...?
I don't know... I would
only receive phone calls...
If I didn't do what
they wanted me to...
...they would have killed my wife...
- Gita...?
The lady you saw was not my Gita...
She was one of them...
You will kill this man...
Yes, you will...
They'd held my wife hostage...
They sent her only this morning...
I came back to rescue you
after getting her home safely...
Which number did they call you from...?
I tried tracing the number,
but couldn't...
That Flow Chart didn't come to London...
Excuse me, Sir...
I am afraid you can't go in there...
We're here for the Restaurant...
The Restaurant's over there, Sir...
Shiva, how are you?
Sharath, listen to me carefully...
I've been framed,
Call up Mr. Ravi... - What are you saying?
The pen drive we came in search of
does not have the Flow Chart... - Then?
Everything looks planned here...
On one side I have the
London Police after me...
...and on the other;
someone is selling that
Flow Chart to Terrorists...
Shiva, how is this possible...
Call up the Minister right away
and inform the British Government...
Shiva, are you there?
Are you there?
Tell me where you are right now...?
Is Sharath the man
behind all of this...?
Back in Delhi, he was my friend,
family and guide...
Are there many people behind this...?
You are risking your life
and doing this instead of me...
You were the one who
gave my life back to me...
Are you going to make a call to the
Minister or to Mr. Ravichandran...?
Why did you do this...?
I did it... for Money...
Just for mere money...?
This "mere" money you are
talking about caused my son's death...
What did this Department give me
for being honest and hardworking...?
Always Number 2...
And I've never been
recognized for my hard work...
Best of Luck!
That's when I got a call...
My ray of hope...
Hello!
This Case was yours...
I came here for you...
That is exactly what I am saying...
Why did you butt in unnecessarily...?
Things have been going wrong
only because you came in...
What about the Flow Chart...?
Yes... The Flow Chart was with me...
Just when things were going on smoothly,
You came in and disrupted it...
Where is the Flow Chart...?
My Department knows you are here...
They'll never catch me...
If they catch me,
They catch you...
Then, I'll have to kill you...
You need money... You need me...
I need money...
But, I don't need you anymore...
Your Ml6 friends asked me
to say "Good Bye" to you...
If I had let him go alive,
you would have figured out
everything in India and arrested me...
Because, Friendship is
not important to you...
For you, it's always
Duty and Service first...
But, I am not like that...
When you stepped in unnecessarily,
I wanted to make sure Steven
or his people don't harm you...
Hence, I devised a plan...
...and sent a dummy pen drive
to London and sent you here...
See you...
My counter operation was
to have you arrested...
...and keep you in a safe place
till our Transaction was over...
I always wanted to save you...
Hey! I don't want this
"Life" that you helped save...
I will show the
world your true colors...
Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!
Why don't you understand...?
Come with me...
You will get an unimaginably
fabulous life and wealth...
Even talking to you is a Sin...
You'd better surrender...
You can atleast go back alive...
I did it... just forget about it now!
Will you kill a friend...?
Don't Sharath... Just surrender...
Your game is over...
If you kill me...
Who'll be there for Asha...?
Don't try and get away by using Asha...
I am not going to fall
for those sentiments...
Who is it on the phone, Bro...?
Is it Shiva...?
Meena...?
No.. Did you come just now...?
- Yes...
Are you done with shopping...?
Sharath!
Did you get to know where Shiva is...?
No...
- Sharath!
I'm talking to someone
who is in touch with him...
He must have got information about you
coming all the way for his birthday...
He will definitely be
here tomorrow, won't he...?
He will definitely come...
If he misses seeing you tomorrow,
he knows he may not
be able to see you soon...
Yeah!
Sharath, don't do this...
Don't add to the list of
things you are doing wrong...
Please tell Shiva to come to the
Tower Bridge at 8am, tomorrow...
His wife will be waiting for him...
Sharath, don't pull Meena in to this...
If he is amidst something important,
don't disturb him...
He may be a Senior Officer
but he is fully entitled
to love and affection...
Make sure you go to the
Tower Bridge at 8 tomorrow...
Sharath!!
Shiva will be waiting for you...
My dearest... In your eyes
I wish to see my face!
Even in my sleep, I want to stay awake
And see you appear in my dreams!
In love, I have now become a Swing,
swaying in the breeze...
I want to live beyond my time,
that's all I have to ask!
The railway tracks are
estranged only to traverse a distance...
The moon rises in the west so
I can look for you within me!
Should I treat you
like a five year old...?
Should I plant affectionate
kisses all over your cheeks and face...?
For the present and the future
this boon of love is enough!
Even after death, this
memory will last forever...
My dearest... In your eyes
I wish to see my face!
Even in my sleep, I want to stay awake
And see you appear in my dreams!
In love, I have now become a Swing,
swaying in the breeze...
I want to live beyond my time,
that's all I have to ask!
Meena...
Sharath hasn't come...
If he's sent her alone,
that only means he has a plan...
Shiva, please wait...
You have several
surveillance Cameras here...
The Police might see you...
I'll bring her...
- Be careful...
Hey!! Kenny!
Kenny!
Meena, don't come... Go Back!
No!!!
Sir, Shivakumar in his greed for money,
...took the Flow Chart
from the Cargo office...
And sold our Military
secrets to a Terrorist group...
He has not only failed in his duty...
...but has also disgraced our Country...
Where is Shivakumar...?
Sir...
Sir...
His wrong deed led to his wife
and him dying in that very blast...
Here are the Reports...
What a disgrace!!!
Had it been me, I would have
committed suicide in shame...
Don't talk nonsense!
Do you know what happened there?
The Newspapers have all the details...
Do Newspapers always
give you the truth...?
Uncle, don't argue with them...
- Don't talk without knowing what it really is...
Uncle, let them be... leave it... come...
- Talking too much...
We are hurt already...
Sister...
- Mom...
Mom...
Mom...
Mom...
Excuse me! Do you know this man...?
May I have his name...?
Kenny!
Kenny Thomas!
Thank you...
Very good... Ok...
Target Number 4... Jessica...
My husband, Shiva's wife
and several others,
paid the price for
their selfish motives...
They couldn't be brought to courts
because of the lack of evidence...
We decided to annihilate
Injustice with Justice...
Did he get away because of us...?
You didn't help Victor get away... we did...
He knows that I will come
here only if you get away...
What do we do now?
If the London Police
get their hands on Shiva,
It is not just he who will be caught...
All of us will be caught...
We have to get Shiva before they do...
If he can do all of this without vision,
that only means he is not alone in this...
There is someone helping him...
Mrs. Gita Kenny...?
That's right!
Someone came in about 2 hours ago...
...asking the same question
about Mrs. Gita Kenny...
May I know who that was?
I am Sorry, that's confidential...
Someone is looking for Shiva
far more fervently than us...
Gita is not here...
Don't know where she is;
don't know how to follow her...
We don't have to follow Gita...
It is enough to find
out who is following us...
I've got information that the
Police are following this case keenly...
Hence, you don't get too involved...
I'll take care of this...
Driver, go to the Factory...
Please come...
This is my Factory...
It's a very safe place...
You can stay here without any hassles...
No one can come here
without my knowledge...
Gita... Shit!!
Security! Stop the Black Car...
Victor...
We'll have to use Gita to find Shiva...
We've got important information...
We have to leave immediately...
We have to let the
Control Room know immediately...
What is the information, Sir...?
- Victor...
The Skyways Steel Factory owner...
Is it that Victor...?
He became the owner only last year...
Before that,
Victor and the 3 other
people who were killed by Shiva...
...worked with Ml6,
as undercover agents...
I knew that even earlier...
But, when I enquired
Victor the last time...
I was surprised he
said he didn't know...
...the 3 other people who were murdered...
That's when I let go
of Shiva's trail...
...and started checking on Victor...
I wanted to keep track of his
whereabouts without his knowledge;
I got a Bug fixed in his car...
He was the one collecting
information about Gita at the Hospital...
Right now, his car...
...has gone past City limits
and is headed towards Essex...
Shiva!
Shiva!
Shiva!
What happened...?
Number 1: Sharath...
Skyways Steel Factory... East London...
Why did you scream...?
Number 2: Victor...
Hello!
Sir, it's me, Karthik...
Mr. Veerakathy knows where Gita is...
Be careful...
- Shit!
What are you thinking about...?
About why I didn't kill you
there but brought you here instead...?
The Police know where you are...
By now, they would have
come there in search of you...
They will think you killed
Gita and got away from there...
No one knew you were alive...
And now, no one will know you are dead...
The Police will search for you again...
The search will be endless...
There's no evidence
- Who's there...?
...left against us...
Nor will you be left behind...
What about the Taxi driver...?
Where am I...?
Sir... The Address you wanted to go to...
Hello, Sir...
I am waiting for a Customer...
Isn't he your regular Customer...?
Sir, do you know...
- I know...
4+1 makes it 5...
But, it would amount to
one punishment anyway...
Victor!!
Victor!!
I don't know whether I should
feel happy that you are alive
Or feel sad that you are not dead...
Meena's death was an accident...
You were the reason for it...
You were too honest...
It's not too late even now...
You can live and let me live...
The Sky...
Water...
Air...
Land...
Gary...
Ravichandran, even if
Shiva has lost his vision,
Our Country needs his
intellect and acumen...
Ask him to come to India immediately...
Justice will be put to test...
But it will regain its place of pride...
This saying proves right in your case...
That all the people you killed were...
...Terrorists plotting
against this country,
...is now proven by Law...
Hence, this Government has
accepted the request from India
And is setting you free...
Your Department in India is
waiting for you to come back
as "Shiva"...the way you were...
The "Shiva" you are talking about...
...is long dead...
I am going to live my life...
...for Meena...
