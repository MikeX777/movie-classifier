We couldn't have met in a worse manner.
It's this late already?!
I'm gonna be late for practice!
Oh no, it's all over the floor...
Hey, you.
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm so sorry—
I have somewhere to be,
so you'd better clean up this mess!
What's with that look?
It's just, um...
Speak up!
I, uh...
I can... see...
Wanna grab something to eat?
Do you ever think about anything but food?
Get back here!
The hell...?
Something wrong?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
You saw, didn't you?
No I didn't! I saw nothing!
I would never look at your panda panties!
You totally did!
Huh?
Something happen, Hina?
Wait, Koyuki?
E-Enomoto...
Nacchan, you know this guy?
He's in my class!
In your class?
Yeah, he's my classmate, Ayase Koyuki.
Wait, that means...
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
I had no idea you were my senior!
No, I should be the one apologizing.
I'll clean everything up, so don't worry about it.
We couldn't have met in a worse manner.
But...
I did notice...
Someday...
I'll fall
in love
with him
in love
Would you mind going out with a younger girl?
Maybe you'd prefer someone who grows their hair out?
If I asked you out now, how would you respond?
I'm just head over heels... in love!

The Moment
The Moment
I had my stupid reasons to apply to this school
What's it gonna take from me
To get you to turn your head my way?
I hope all my "coincidences" don't push you away
Every day a new excuse to jump out and say hi to you
I know that we make an unusual pair (I'll try!)
Yet I'm always inching closer to you (Trying!)
Riverboats
Feelings building up inside as I do (Trying!)
I'll give my all tomorrow too (I'll try!)
Would you mind going out with a younger girl?
Would you be too ashamed?
You started living just a little bit before me, my darling
You started learning how to love a little bit early
If I seized the hands of time
I'd push my own clock forward just to catch up
You and me could sit together in classes
You and me could make a wonderful couple
Please, just let my wish come true!
Just fall in love with me like I did with you!
It doesn't matter to me
That you are a whole year ahead
Please just notice me right by your side
Time to eat!
You're still wearing that hoodie?
Well yeah, it's super comfy!
Yeah, that's why it's my favorite.
Oh, I'll take one, okay?
Sure, go ahead.
I love you, Big Bro!
You're so silly.
You'd better hurry or you'll be late
for your morning practice!
Okey-dokey!
Morning practice again?
Talk about early.
No, you're just late!
You might be stupid, but I admit
waking up this early is impressive.
Very impressive.
Oh, shut up!
I'm off!
Shee ya.
I'm off!
Ugh, Kotarou... Why are you here?
Going to morning practice, obviously!
Why else would I be leaving this early?
Great.
My wonderful morning has just been ruined.
That's my line.
Saying "ugh" the moment
you see someone is so rude!
Enomoto
Could at least start with "morning" or—
No time to chat!
Enomoto
Hey, get back here!
At least pretend to listen when someone's talking!
See ya later!
You really think you can outrun
the star of the soccer team?!
And I run hurdles!
Underestimate me at your own peril!
Pass it!
Here!
Kotarou!
Cover!
Nice shot!
Sure enjoying his youth.
Good job putting in effort this early!
It's because morning practice is the
only time first-years can touch the ball.
Oh, shut up!
Ready...
One! Two! Three! Four!
Despite our disastrous first meeting...
What's our next class again?
Music.
Good morning, Setoguchi.
H-Hi.
Since then, he's been greeting me every time, but...
Koyuki.
Morning!
Morning!
Sakata, Urata!
Oh, morning.
Morning.
Is someone there?
N-Not really.
Isn't that... Ayase Koyuki or something?
So you know him, Kotarou?
Natsuki's friend who shares her hobbies?
I don't know much, though.
Oh, he stumbled.
What a weirdo!
Enomoto!
Does Setoguchi like that Ayase person?
What? No way!
He's basically a girl!
Really?
Who cares!
Koyuki...
Setoguchi—
Ayase!
Doing this every day must take a lot of dedication!
Um...
I don't think we've met...
Takamizawa Arisa, first year!
Takamizawa?
That's right!
Nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too!
Takamizawa?
Ah, Setoguchi—
Koyuki!
What?
Setogu—
Koyuki!
What?
Ah, Seto—
Yuki!
Need me to help you with the flowers?
No, actually I—
Great! Happy to help!
Right this way!
Wha—
What's her deal?
She's acting all cozy with
Koyuki all of a sudden!
Oh, hey Hina.
About the next match...
I was put on the team actually, so uh...
I was wondering if you'd—
Man, she ticks me off so much!
Hey, that hurt!
The hell are you doing?!
Hey!
Hina!
Hina...
Sheesh.
Wait...
Why am I so on edge?
Setoguchi.
It's not like I'm interested in him or anything...
Wait, am I interested?
No, I'm not!
There's no way someone that
useless could be my first love!
My type is tall, manly, and dependable!
Like my brother!
But...
Every time our eyes meet,
he smiles at me so sweetly...
It's unfair to smile like that.
Ah, Setoguchi.
Are you heading to practice?
Why?
Just because our eyes met...
If they meet again...
If they meet just a few more times...
No! No, I can't!
I don't want to admit it!
Setoguchi!
Is something the matter?
Are you all right?
See...
Even though I don't want to admit it,
even though he's not my type at all,
I get so happy when we meet.
I...
This feeling is...
Koyuki...
Graduating is so sad.
I want to stay with everyone.
Right, we ended up going to different schools...
But we'll stay friends forever, won't we?
Yeah!
We'll meet up again for sure, right?
Right!
Koyuki...
Setoguchi.
Which high school are you applying to?
Sakuragaoka High.
Sakuragaoka...
S-Setoguchi?
Setoguchi?
Um...
Don't cry, Hina!
I'll take a picture!
Okay?
Come on, smile!
Hey, Kotarou!
Whatcha doing?
Mochita... Look at that.
You're crying way too much!
Why's Hina crying?
No idea.
Isn't she just sad her friends are graduating?
Can't say I understand.
If anything, I'm happy all the
older students are leaving.
When you put it like that,
I'm not sure what to think.
But yeah, the way girls think is a mystery.
They're always changing their minds,
you never know when
you're gonna step on a landmine,
and they're just so annoying to deal with in general.
Don't tell me you get bossed around by both
your older and younger sisters, Mochita.
H-How did you figure that out?
Kotarou?
What's so special about that guy?
I just don't get girls!
There he is!
Hey!
I won't get to see Koyuki anymore...
I don't want that!
I'm going to apply to Sakuragaoka High!
Huh?
So can you please tutor me, Big Bro?
Sure, but why Sakuragaoka?
I-Isn't it obvious? I wanna go to
the same high school as you!
Now imagine a world with no feelings at all

No one likes anyone
No one knows how to try
We'd give up without a reason why
Natsuki!
There's something I don't get.
Can you explain it to me?
Huh? What makes you think I know?
Wait, isn't that math...
Are you proud of yourself?
How did you even get into
Sakuragaoka High like that?
Now imagine a world with no feelings at all
Dunno, just did!
Why don't you ask Yuu to teach you?
No one loves anyone
Hina is aiming for Sakuragaoka too, right?
No one follows their fate
So it never could've led me to you
Y-Yeah.
Who would we live for?
Ah, I see now!
Did you actually choose Sakuragaoka
because Hina is applying there?
What would our purpose be?
"How embarrassing, I know what that's like"
Hell no, dumbass! You're so dumb!
That's my reason to be at your side
Wha—You called me dumb twice!
When a love meets a love
It's 'cause of how good Sakuragaoka
High's soccer team is! Obviously!
Locking eyes is a miracle
If you want it, you just have to ask
I see, I see.
Figure it out and find what's true
That's impressive!
Do your best!
I'm sure I'll do better than you at least!
What a rude little brother.
But our world seems upset. Is it something we said?
Far too often, it seems
"Love" and "like" alike
Get left at the side of the road
For that reason alone, I don't know what to do
I feel powerless
I take it out on you
Even though it's just a fact of life
When it's you meeting me
The encounter's a miracle
I chased you at max speed
Stumbling the entire way
If I had a chance to have a single wish granted
For anything I want
I would give everyone apart from you and me a blissful life
And then say to you:
"You don't need a miracle
I can bring you happiness
All by myself"
Letting my feelings out, speaking softly so you can't hear
"You're my love. You're my love. You're my love," I whispered so
Look! There you are!
There's your name!
Can you see it?
We did it!
We did it! We did it!
All right!

Let's see, my seat is...
T-Takamizawa...
Looks like we're in the same class!
Let's have a good year, Setoguchi.
Yeah, let's.
Say, have you met Koyuki yet?
Are you still in love with him?
If I answer, it'll only encourage her.
I should ignore her.
I'm impressed that you came all the way
to this high school just for him.
Not really. And that wasn't the reason anyway.
But you haven't seen him since his
middle school graduation, have you?
It's been two years.
Maybe he's a totally different person now.
You sure he still remembers you?
There's no way he'd forget!
This is Yuu's sister, Hina!
Welcome to this school.
Who made you the boss?
I'm Setoguchi Hina.
Thank you for looking after my brother.
Hina! Not you, too...
What's the problem?
Actually, me and Hina are basically sisters!
Yeah!
I've never considered you my sister, though.
Teehee.
Hina, huh?
What a polite girl you are!
Nice to meet you, Hina.
Are you used to the school yet?
Yes! It's already been a week, after all.
I didn't know you had a sister, Setoguchi.
Can't say I expected that.
Really?
Yeah.
Though come to think of it,
you do have this dependable aura.
Hina, Natsuki, Kotarou...
I'm absolutely surrounded by children to babysit.
Why am I on the list?
Kotarou?
Natsuki's brother.
Don't ignore me!
Ah, right!
Nacchan's brother also enrolled here, didn't he?
Sounds like it's going to get
really lively around here!
Akarin is as angelic as ever...
Mochita, we can see you.
I wonder which class Koyuki is in?
Soccer
Tennis
Ah, Kotarou!
Haruki!
Good job making it into this school.
Though if Midori can get in, anybody can.
Surprisingly easy, right?
Whatcha say?!
Haruki, you ain't ever gonna
beat me in PE or Health!
There's no entrance exams for those!
Ah, Serizawa!
Oh, hey Narumi!
Get a load of this!
What is it?
Midori here was just bragging
that no one can beat him in Health!
You idiot!
Not Health!
It's PE! It's PE that I'm good at!
You can't just say that Sex Ed
is someone's best subject!
Hey man, I never said that.
I-I see...
Well, see you guys later.
No way, it's Narumi Sena!
I'm not dreaming, am I?
You're the real deal!
Um, could you stop screaming
and calm down, please?
Ah, I'm so sorry!
You've been my role model since forever!
I want to be as amazing as you!
I've been checking out all the CMs
you appear in, and I read your magazines too!
Um, thank you...
You were also a model for some
new hairstyles recently, weren't you?
Your hair looked so cute!
Oh! Could that be...
This hairpin? Yes, I was wearing it for a few pictures.
That's so nice! It's so cute!
See ya!
So you really are watching me closely.
O-Of course!
I really admire you!
You're such an amazing person,
even girls love you.
Meanwhile, I'm the total opposite...
Oh, I don't think I caught your name.
Class 1-1, Takamizawa Arisa!
Nice to meet you, Arisa!
It's weird to see Takamizawa
chatting with another girl.
Hey, Kotarou!
Hey.
If you're looking for Setoguchi, she's thataway.
I-I'm not!
See ya.
I eat HoneyWorld's pudding every day!
It's so good!
Wanna go to karaoke today?
Sure!
You sure he still remembers you?
What if he really doesn't remember me?
Setoguchi!
It's been a while.
So you came to this high school.
I did.
I suppose we'll be seeing plenty
of each other again, then.
Yeah!
The cherry tress in full bloom lost all
their petals in virtually the blink of an eye.
My first semester passed with little progress
other than just greeting Koyuki.
But in the second...
I'll definitely talk to him more today!
Who is that?
He's so cool!
Koyuki has... changed.
Why?
I don't even need to ask.
I'm sure it was because he wants
the person he likes to like him back.
That's how it is for everyone.
So why does it sometimes go wrong?
I'm gonna be late!
Yukki!
Where should I plant this flower?
This belongs right here.
Yukki! I'll help too!
Thank you.
What are those yellow flowers?
They're in the same family
as the ones over there, you see...
What the heck?!
No one ever cared about him until now!
And now he's surrounded by girls?!
I was first to fall in l—
Actually...
I guess it doesn't really matter.
Setoguchi!
What's wrong, Yukki?
Was that your friend?
I don't know anymore!
How can I face Koyuki when
he's trying so hard for the person he likes?
But... I want...
I want to talk with him!
Koyuki...
Hina!
Big Bro?!
There was a movie you wanted
to watch, wasn't there?
How about we do something together for a change?
Come on, get ready.
It's weird to see you inviting me to something.
Is it?
I mean, lately you haven't even been
playing games with me anymore!
I know it's easy for you to forget, but...
I have entrance exams to worry about.
I know.
Thanks!
Hina! You're heavy!
Ew, you like your brother?
Kotarou!
Hi, Kotarou.
So what?!
You're in love with your sister too!
Of course I'm not, you idiot!
In denial, are we?
'Cause it ain't true!
I do not love my sister!
Sister-lover!
Brother-lover!
Sister-lover!
Brother-lover!
Sister-lover!
Brother-lover!
You two are such good friends.
No we're not!
Aren't you going somewhere?
You should go.
I don't need your permission!
Let's go, Big Bro.
Kotarou.
Thanks.
Something wrong?
Let's go.
Huh? I thought you were going somewhere?
Not anymore.
Why not?

I guess it's fine as long as she's enjoying herself.
A panda or a polar bear?
Oh, I dunno...
It's so hard to choose.
Man, Setoguchi's like... got pretty big boobs, huh?
What?!
Hey, keep it down.
What are you staring at, Shibaken?!
Actually, haven't you and Setoguchi known
each other since you were kids, Kotarou?
Y-Yeah.
Seriously? So you've touched them before!
Can you give it a rest, you dumbass?!
You're a healthy teen, aren't you? It's normal!
There's nothing normal about
what you consider normal!
Tell him, Koudai!
I'd rather not get involved in this.
Well? What made you fall for Setoguchi?
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Bam. Proof.
You can't keep your eyes off her, man.
Class 1-3
Class 1-4
I-It was j-just a coincidence!
Don't you think girls like that
are kinda a pain in the ass?
Like, she's too serious, y'know.
If anything I think you're too carefree, Shibaken.
Y'think?
'Sup, Rika!
'Bout the date we got planned...
Wait, for real?
Kotarou.
That's perfect!
Don't pay attention to anything Shibaken says.
Just do what you're comfortable
with and give it your best.
You're both assuming
I'm actually in... love... with Hina.
I haven't said a—
Oh, were we wrong?
Which one will you choose?
You see...
That's so like you!
Do my best, huh?
Is it okay to visit her without a reason?
I'll be going home!
Welcome back!
Oh, Natsuki. Were you visiting again?
Yeah.
Was she around?
Who?
You know who I'm talking about!
No, I don't! That's why I'm asking!
The girl who's the same age as me!
Ah, you're talking about Hina!
D-Did she say anything about me?
What?
Enomoto
Why would we be talking about you?
Enomoto
I'm just asking!
Enomoto
Enomoto
I get it, don't worry.

Ugly bitch!
You did not just call your big sister that!
Ugly bitch, ugly bitch, ugly bitch, idiot!
H-Hey! You're the ugly idiot here!
Ugly!
Damn. I don't have a chance.
But...
Even if I know, even if I understand
There's no way I could just turn my back on you like that
I love her...
Even now I'm still... in love
Kota!
Kota!
Not a guy to count on, nothing to remark on, and he's such a coward, too
Kota!
I just don't get what it is you see in him
I want her to laugh.
I saw you acting oh so headstrong, like the gap just wasn't there
Even if I'm not the one she's in love with.
I still couldn't bear to see you two meet
Then I realized, whenever I saw you with him
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure she doesn't cry.
You two would lock eyes, and you would always have a smiling face
See you!
I couldn't get past just how kind he was to you
Bye!
In my softest voice, I declare my love for you
It's Haruki and Miou.
Could another step have really been enough
I'm kinda jealous.
For my voice to make its way to you?
I will always be standing right there by your side
Because I know, I understand it all
Feeling hungry, Kotarou?
What?
Hey girls, let's have hamburgers together.
I'd prefer to get home as soon
as possible and study for our tests.
When it comes to eating,
the more the merrier, right?
Can't concentrate on an empty stomach, y'know?
Let's go.
What's wrong with you?
Relax, I'll pay.
All righty then, shall we introduce ourselves?
Pleasure to meet you, Mademoiselle
Oh, Misato?
I hail from the West
Yeah, I'm fine now.
I have come all this way just for you
What? Now?
That I may see your face
This may all be quite sudden for you
Obviously I was thinking about you.
But there's no need to be alarmed
Every prince seeks a princess, of course
It's "Misato only" anytime, anywhere.
Could you be the one for me?
I never think about other girls, seriously.
No, really. Always.
I only ever dream about you, seriously.
No, I'm serious!
What's wrong with these people?
What about you?
Is something the matter, Mademoiselle?
No, I haven't.
Your face is rather drawn
This sort of look doesn't suit you; chin up
Won't you lend me your ear?
You're under no obligation, of course, but
Why don't you come with me?
You could just leave your whole life here behind
And follow me to the East
Those red lips upon your face
Look to be so very lonely
I can cast a gentle spell
To ease your heart
Come on now, put on your most wonderful dress
So I can take your hand and ask for a dance with the most dear, sweet princess
What's wrong?
Everyone wants to make you theirs
You can drive us all to madness for you
Oh, nothing.
It's always been a dream of mine to stop by
somewhere with friends on the way home.
So I'll steal true love's kiss
Close your eyes, I've a present for you
I see...
Now look up, to the sky
All the shining stars
I'll bring them down just for you
The best thing they have here is this apple pie!
The whole world wants to make you theirs
We would all do anything to be with you
And your name is Julietta
Here, have half!
It's really sweet.
Well, since you're offering...
You needn't leave me, Mademoiselle
Stay with me by my side
Sorry, girls, that took a while.
You've such a wonderful smile right now
All right, in order to get to know each other better,
I'd hate to see it fade
And if you should happen to shed a tear
let's do an "ask me anything"!
I'm sure it will be one of joy
We can spend life hand in hand
Smiling until the end
How would you want someone to ask you out?
You first, Kotarou.
H-How the hell would I know?!
I've never thought about these things before!
What about you, Hina?
As a girl, surely you've thought about it.
Like, you want him to say this, or do this with him...
I really don't know.
With a figure like that you're bound
to be a hit with the boys, right?
Wait, lemme guess. There's someone you like.
Aha, knew it. Who's the lucky guy?
Someone we know?
Come on, don't be shy. We're all friends here.
We're even in the same class. Come on?
You're a total jerk!
What? What did I do?
Can't you see you're making her uncomfortable?
Takamizawa...
Don't be like that.
No need to get all scary.
You're cute, Arisa.
A smile suits you better, yeah?
Don't play dumb.
No idea what you mean.
No one's having fun and yet
you're laughing like an idiot.
But we are having fun!
Better to laugh instead of just being all serious.
I'm sure doing that...
isn't fun at all!
Okay, that's enough!
Our food's getting cold, so let's just eat.
Y-You're right.
Let's eat!
Hey, Kotarou!
Ketchup!
What are you even doing?
Yeah! What are you even doing?
Dangerous stuff, that ketchup, eh?
I came to the same high school,
and yet nothing's changed...
Oh? Hina?
Miou.
You seem a bit down, Hina.
I'm not really...
Are you not with Haruki today?
Hm? Nah.
I see.
What do you usually talk with Haruki about?
Why are you suddenly so curious?
Aw come on, tell me!
Just... stuff.
Normal stuff.
What's that supposed to mean?
Normal stuff is just stuff that's normal.
Things that happened at school, friends...
Sometimes the movies that Haruki likes.
It really is always just the most unimportant things.
What's wrong?
Did something happen
between you and your friends?
You had a falling out and it's hard
to talk to them now, or something?
Well, not exactly, but...
Actually...
It's like we're not even at that stage yet.
When I wonder what they're thinking about,
Yoshida Public Library
or what they think of me,
all of a sudden I'm lost for words.
If only I could just let it all out!
I know what you mean.
I want them to know how I feel
because I want to be friends with them,
but if I tell them, it might end up
making us more distant instead.
Is this about love?
Huh?!
So there's someone you like, huh?
M-Miou!
It's fine. I won't tell Setoguchi.
You know, I have a friend who's full of regrets.
She's been lying to herself,
and she's still unable to voice her feelings.
She knows that she's in love,
but she lacks the courage.
Isn't that silly?
Maybe she's also scared of becoming distant,
and that's why she can't say anything.
Just like me.
Yeah.
But it's not like we have forever.
If we graduate without saying anything,
our loved ones might go somewhere far away.
And before you know it, that distance you mention
might become far more literal than you expect.
Graduation...
I wonder if Koyuki will also go
far away once he graduates.
How many more times...
How many more times will I still get
to talk with him face-to-face?
To battle!
How the heck do I even write a love letter?
Ayase Koyuki,
I don't really get a chance to talk to you at school, so...

I'll write it all down.
Every last one of my feelings.
Say, all these feelings inside of you
Aren't you gonna need to bury them away?
Acting as if they're feeling down
Acting as if they're withering
The thorny flowers all droop their faces to the ground
I want my secrets to stay with me
But I still want to bloom so free
You introduced me to this pain, and so I want to give my thanks
Please give me the courage to confess my love
This love which I can never quite express to you
It always seems as if the words escape me
I'm not just gonna ask for you to hold me
I like to think that I'm not quite that weak
But deep inside I think it might be what I want
All of those flowers that we planted together
They tell us the next season is about to begin

And when our time together is almost at an end
We should plant some more
Please let all the love I feel reach you
Please let it draw me close to you and bind us
Dear Koyuki,
I bet you're surprised by this sudden letter, right?
I can totally see your face right now!
We first met in middle school, remember?
I don't know about you, but I can recall it very clearly.
You tripped and spilled rubbish all over the floor
I had just cleaned!
I'm really sorry I ended up chasing and yelling at you,
not knowing you were a third-year...
Since then, every time our eyes met, you'd start talking to me.
That smile you gave me should be reserved only for the girl
you like...
Yet it made me really, really happy.
I looked forward to seeing you at school so much,
I would look around for you every day.
And the reason I was crying at your graduation ceremony...
Part of it was obviously that I wouldn't see my big bro
(Setoguchi Yuu - that's my brother) or Nacchan at school
anymore, but when I thought about how you were graduating
as well, the tears just started flowing...
I've kept the picture we took that day
in my room this whole time.
When I entered high school, I saw that you had cut your hair,
become more handsome, become more popular, and in just one
year already a talking point of the whole school!
I have to admit, I was a little bit jaelous.
But I knew that even though I've had these feelings
for a while, I had to put them into words, because they
wouldn't ever reach you otherwise, which is why I'm writing
this letter.
I love you, Koyuki.
You're so irresponsible, yet so kind and strong.
Please let me stay in love with you.
Hina
Please let me feel all the love inside me
I'm not even sad, so this doesn't make sense
Why is it that I feel like I'm on the verge of tears?
I found the strength to say it on that day alone
And now I know I won't achieve the same today
I'm glad that you're the one I fell for
I'm grateful that you were the one I first loved
I'm grateful that you were the one I first confessed to
When spring comes 'round, why don't we make the flowers bloom some more?
Yes, all the flowers that I know you so adore
Did you wait?
No.
Okay!
Pass here!
Enomoto!
Come!
What's wrong with you, Takamizawa?!
Setoguchi was acting weird!
Kotarou!
What's wrong?!
I'm sorry! I'm stealing him for an urgent matter!
Hey, I never agreed!
If you don't go right now...
I...
I owe a lot to both you and Setoguchi.

That's why...
I'm sorry.
I... don't really know how to say this...
Yeah, me too.
I never seem to be able to find the right words.
No matter how hard I try, I end up running in circles.
But you know...
If you give up, it's all over!
Takamizawa.
Thanks!
Good luck, Enomoto!
Thanks!
Congratulations, my former love.
He hasn't gone home yet, has he?
He should be done with his club by now...
He's late.
Koyuk—
Setoguchi.
Did something happen?
What are you doing here?
This is the worst timing ever.
Um...
I have to say it.
"I've been waiting for you."
I have to say it!
Um...
What about you?
I got heartbroken.
Heartbroken...
Though I guess it doesn't really concern you...
I like you.
I like you, Koyuki!
You don't have to try and cheer me up.
Thank you.
That's not... what I meant.
You should go home before it gets dark.
See you.
Wait!
You are...
You!
You made Hina cr—
Can't you even tell when a girl's being serious?!
Are you in love with Setoguchi?
Wh—
Be sure not to have any regrets.
Wait.
What's wrong with him?
Let's go home.
Don't you want to give it to him?
It's fine.
No it's not.
Didn't you put your heart and soul into it?
It's not like it'd change anything.
Man, that really pisses me off.
Why are you upset now?
'Cause I just am.
At him, and at myself for not
being able to do anything...
It really pisses me off.
You're such a weirdo.
By the way, do you think
you'll get on the soccer team?
'Course.
Hundred percent!
It'd be nice if you could do it
through sheer willpower.
It's important!
I can do my best because I'm so confident.
Even if you know it might not go well?
That won't stop me.
When you're serious about something,
you gotta go all out.
No matter what happens.
Yeah.
We have a match for regular team members soon.
Come and watch.
Maybe if I have nothing better on...
You little...
If I feel like it!
So, when is it?
You're the one who made me who I am
I never expected to turn out this way
Now I know I need you in my life
It just has to be you, please stay with me
"Hey, just curious, which class are you in?"
Class 2-1
Class 2-2
Class 2-3
Class 2-4
Acting super nonchalant
"Are we in the same one?
Not that I care either way"
"So you were hoping to be in my class?"
Giving you a teasing prod
"Look at that, guess we are!
Now we have an example to set"
"Oh, by the way,
I got on the team, why don't you watch me play?"
"Well, I did say
I would come, so I'll see you there"
There you were
I heard you shout out
"You'd better win it all!"
You're the one who made me who I am
I never expected to turn out this way
Now I know I need you in my life
It just has to be you, please stay with me
Used to hate how forward you could be
But now I feel like something might've changed
"Look at him now, shining like a hero"
Then when our eyes met, I turned all red
It felt like my heart skipped a beat

Normally, I'd never ask
"Aren't you taking a break?
Look at you, all bored and alone"
"Would you quit acting like we're together?"

But the rumors and the teasing followed us
"Hate this kind of thing
Being laughed at really hurts"
So I thought
I'd answer them by
Just reaching for your hand
When you're sad and when you want to cry
I promise I'll make you happy again
Now I know I want to see you smile 'cause
That's the look that suits you best
"Don't tell me what I already know!"
I couldn't admit how I really felt
Honestly, you made me really glad
So I wish I'd been more honest with you
"Sorry for exploding like that..."
Friends were making fun of me
"Hey man, don't you give her up"
Oh, so nice of them
"Sorry, I'm not the type to give up that easily"
"Say, tonight..."
"Yeah, what's up?"
"Can we meet?"
"Sure, why not"
"Listen though"
"What is it?"
"Gotta ask"
"Go ahead"
"Do you have someone who you maybe like?"
You saw through me and then simply said
Without any chance for me to confess
"Sorry, but there's already someone
Who I like, I've always liked him so much"
Everything's changed
Things are awkward now and you're avoiding me
"Why does it hurt?"
I can't soothe my aching heart
But I ran
I chased you and tried
To shout out how I feel
You should know my feelings won't change
You love someone else, but nevertheless
Now I know that I'm in love with you
And nothing's gonna change how I feel
Used to hate how forward you could be
But now I feel like something might've changed
"Look at him now, he really is my true hero"
Then our eyes met, I turned all red
It felt like my heart skipped a beat
Could I really be... in love?
So, as luck would have it,
I have four movie tickets here!
It seems both Yuu and I bought a pair.
But it would be a shame to let them go to waste.
What should we do now?
Do whatever the hell you want.
Got something in mind?
Let's go on a double date!
I'm so excited!
When's the last time we saw a movie together?
You think those two'll work out as a couple?
For sure! They've been in love
with each other since forever.
They're a good match.
Are you okay with your brother
being snatched away?
It's okay if it's Nacchan.
I want him to find happiness anyway.
Huh...
What about you, huh? Are you devastated
your sister's being snatched away?
What? Why would I be?!
I can see right through you.
You're totally in love with Nacchan!
'Course not, you idiot!
Yeah, yeah, no need to get all embarrassed!
We've known each other for so long I can tell!
Hell no! The one I like is—
...you.
I know.
Oh, I forgot to mention!
Congrats on making the starting team!
Hey, what's taking you so long?
The movie's about to start.
Is something wrong, Kotarou?
You're all red!
Like a monkey!
Who are you calling a monkey?!
Let's go, Big Bro!
Hey! Hina!
He's mine!
We're on a date today!
Hey! Don't leave me behind!
Chop chop, Kotarou!
Movie's not gonna wait!
Let's just leave him behind!
