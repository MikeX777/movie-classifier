After I got out,
 he was incharge of the whole factory.
So, Venky is a hotshot now!
Is it so?
Gali must not be happy about this.
Have you spoken to Patil?
I don't know...
He writes to me once in a while.
He is working in some Gandhi ashram.
Manu, this is your room.
My cab owner owns this building.
You can stay here for a few days.
The bathroom is on the terrace.
The key is kept there.
Ok.
Sorry. Itâ€™s a little messy.
This is good.
Have you thought about getting a job?
I have enlisted
 for the jail programme.
Good. Keep this money.
 Youâ€™ll need it.
Charge your phone.
 It runs out of battery quickly.
And like I said earlier,
It's tough to adjust to reality
 just after getting out.
Donâ€™t worry about it.
Think of the world as a bigger jail.
That thing...
Itâ€™s in the bag. Take it.
You need lots of space
 when you begin a new life.
So donâ€™t forget to let go of the past.
Okay then, bye.
Call me if you need anything.
The day you get out of jail,
 Iâ€™ve planned a huge celebration.
Iâ€™ll decorate the whole house.
Vinodha proposed lighting up
 the streets for your welcome.
I said, youâ€™ll run back to
 jail out of embarrassment.
I know you like my motherâ€™s
 fish curry...
Iâ€™ve learnt to make it.
And Iâ€™ll make tons of sweet sajjige!
After coming out of jail,
 I know itâ€™ll take some time to get settled.
So, you will get special treatment
 only for few days.
But after that, if you stay lazy,
 I wonâ€™t spare you.
I want you to work hard and
 take good care of me...
Like a queen.
The file says you worked hard in jail.
Jail quota workers have to
 follow very strict rules here.
Do your job well.
Youâ€™ll face no problems.
When this programme started,
 Patil had requested for one thing -
To give incomplete jobs
 to people who are out of prison.
For now start work at the fabric section.
"I'll await you forever"
"Longing for you"
"In your path I linger"
Idiot!
"Somewhere beyond the seven seas"
Go and get some sleep!
Iâ€™ve filled fuel.
"You fill my mind"
"You define my smile"
"Every moment I got"
"Your soulful tune"
"Becomes my thought"
"You are my happiness"
I keep thinking of our trip to Madikeri.
The room we stayed in.
The gentle sound of the rain.
The way you hugged me close and slept.
Your breath.
Our laughter.
The way you looked at me.
 I remember it all even today.
I can never forget it
Idiot...
Will you promise me one thing?
Once you get out...
Will you hold me tight and sleep the same way?
Prakasha...
I donâ€™t feel right ...
Ask them to cancel.
Aye, donâ€™t feel right it seems.
 So many years have passed
Donâ€™t you eat when you are hungry?
This is also the same way, ok?
If a married guy like me goes, then its not right.
You donâ€™t have anyone right Manu?
Donâ€™t overthink this.
Understood?
Theyâ€™ll sell you stories, to get more money.
Be careful. Dont overpay.
A white Qualis is here.
Ahh yes.. Thatâ€™s the one.
Hope you know the rates and rules.
Select the girl.
Show him.
The one with the headphones...
Wait over there. She will come to you.
The usual.
Do you know how to sing?
I can sing and make you sing also.
Come.
"The broken pieces have come together."
"It casts your image"
"How do I trust myself anymore?"
"The mind, fickle"
"The eyes, restless"
"How do I trust myself anymore?"
"Oh veiled mirage"
"I've come to you"
Thought this was your first time...
 Not bad.
"Are you my mirage?"
"Is it true?"
Hey, what happened?
So who is it?
Who?
Your eyes were shut the whole time.
Hence, I asked.
Who is she?
An old flame?
Or a next door hottie?
It could also be because
 you donâ€™t have a pretty face.
People come here to do â€˜itâ€™
Not to make love.
So who is this pretty princess?
A dream from a past life.
Ah! A poet!
So what happened to that dream?
I woke up from it!
Whatâ€™s your name?
Manu
And whatâ€™s your real name?
Why? Surabhi isnâ€™t good enough?
Okay
How did this happen?
Is it hard on your eyes?
Yes, a little! But I can adjust.
Do one thing.
Next time,
 even you close your eyes.
I like you.
Can you sing a song?
Which one?
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other day!
There was a loud sound and it woke me up.
I tried hard to revisit the dream, but couldnâ€™t
You know what that dream is?
I had taken you to the
 beach in our village.
Not a single soul in sight!
Just you and me on the beach!
We were walking by the sea
And the waves were washing off our footprints.
I was holding your hand tight.
You know how happy we were?
I can still hear the waves, when I close my eyes.
Can you hear it too?
Hello?
Hello?
Who is it?
Where are you off to with that bag?
I wanted to go to the sea.
Good idea. It will be a good change for you.
When are you leaving?
I wanted to see Priya before going.
Can we trace her location
 using her number?
Man...
Have you lost your mind?
Why do you want Priya now?
I just want to see her before leaving.
Ah!
And what exactly do you plan to do?
I don't know.
Manu, listen to me.
Sheâ€™s will be busy with her own family.
Youâ€™ll make it difficult for her...
 Do you understand?
No, I just want to see her onceâ€¦
That story ended long ago.
 Drop it now!
Restart your life and move on.
The other night...
You went to â€˜thatâ€™ place...
Find some girl there and settle down.
Ok?
Your customer is here...
Hello loverboy!
Was my singing that good?
You will get better with practice.
Practice?
Thereâ€™s a lodge nearby...
For a two hour booking,
 You get one hour free.
Come, letâ€™s go and practice.
No.
Letâ€™s watch a film instead?
A film?
Darling! I kind of like you.
Thatâ€™s why I am not losing it.
I am in this profession for survival
-Not to roam around like a girlfriend.
 -Iâ€™ll pay you..
In full.
Idiot, watch the film!
Do you like the sea?
That heat, humidity, and the stench of fishâ€¦
 I canâ€™t bear it.
Why? Are you going?
At what time?
Can't you send Reema?
Okay fine, Iâ€™ll come.
I have another customer.
Nobody chooses to be in
 this profession.
I know.
-Actually, my motherâ€¦
 -Oye...
I didnâ€™t ask.
What would. you have liked to do instead?
I wanted to study well and become a doctor.
Can you do me a favour?
What?
I will give you a number...
Can you find out the location?
Whose?
Your pretty princess?
What do you plan to do?
I want to kidnap her.
I havenâ€™t planned the details yet.
Please?*
Iâ€™ll think about it.
This is my stop.
Catch you later.
Hello, am I speaking to Priya?
Madam, this is a call from the
 Covid Vaccination Centre.
We need your details madam.
"The pain, up close and intense"
"The resolution, just a pretence."
"Feel breathless, unable to call out to you"
"Life's rudderless, all alone without you."
"This wound will always fester"
"I've survived through this spectre."
"Listen to me, my breath"
"My ever so wavering breath."
"Look at me, my breath"
"I've borne this suffering, my breath."
Manu, I know you really well...
You better not rush me to make babies.
If you do, then it's your loss.
Because all my love will
 go to our child and not you.
And one more thing...
 Iâ€™ll be the deciding the kidâ€™s name.
No school today?
No ... because of Covid
What are you doing here then?
Can I have my ball back?
Whatâ€™s your name?
Puneeth.
Can I also play with you?
What happened to your face?
I fell off the bike.
Were you speeding?
Yes.
My mother scolds my father if he speeds.
Can I also play with you?
"Does the silent lute have strings of words?"
What are you doing at a shop like this, Putti?
"On the wall of darkness I've scrawled my pain,
 Can you read it once?"
"Just once?"
"Despite calling out aloud"
"Can a finished story have a new beginning?"
"Despite the long wait..."
"My desire for you will never end"
"Will never end."
"Listen to me, my breath"
"My ever so wavering breath."
"Look at me, my breath"
"I've borne this suffering my breath."
Manu, before you bought your bike
Remember how we used to walk and talk so much?
When I think about it now...
I wonder what we talked about so much.
After dinner...
Before we sleep, we have to go for a walk, okay?
Where is your husband Putti?
How does it matter to
 you where her husband is!
Something isnâ€™t right.
To see her and her kid...
Poor thing...
Are you kidding me?
Poor thing??? Is it your child?
I should admit you to a mental hospital.
Itâ€™s been 10 years!
Give me one more.
She is living her own life.
She doesn't even know if youâ€™re dead or alive.
You wanted to see her
 one last time, isnâ€™t it?
And you did.
And thatâ€™s enough.
How does it concern
 you where her husband is?
Please donâ€™t even think about her again.
Manu, do you understand?
One quarter and a glass.
Rs. 110
Hello?
-Give me water...
 -Just a moment.
Getting stuff for the house is not my job.
If I have to do everything,
 then I don't want this marriage.
I will drop you back to jail.
Where were you all these days?
I thought you eloped with your
 pretty princess!
Did you meet her?
I can't just meet her!
Is she married?
Is she at least happy?
So itâ€™s that kind of story, huh?
What kind?
(Sings a tragic love song)
Oh come on!
Itâ€™s rare for love stories to ever work out.
Most of them end with an ocean of tears!
If you don't learn from one heartbreak.
You shouldn't value love so much.
What's your height?
Why?
Why?!
When you can't reach the grapes
 they will seem sour.
How dare you!
What do you know about me to say that huh?
There is no guarantee sheâ€™d have
 been happy if she was with you.
Even I donâ€™t know.
Iâ€™ve seen many people
 whoâ€™ve messed up their lives.
Why donâ€™t you get married?
Donâ€™t waste your time on
 useless things like feelings and love.
Hey!
Why are you walking around with a
 mangalsutra like itâ€™s candy!
Where do you want to get married?
In a mental hospital!
Mad fellow!
If you were giving me one,
 instead of a fake...
Had you given me real gold...
I could have pawned it for money.
The money is in the purse.
It looks good on you.
Ah! The smell of fish is inviting!
I'm so hungry.
-Hey you! Come here.
 -Sir
Come here!
What the hell is this?
What happened Sir?
Have you served me fish
 thatâ€™s been rotting for six months?
Prakashâ€¦
And your hotel is called Karavali Fresh!
Who is the owner?
Leave it...
Letâ€™s go elsewhere.
You go call him.
What are you staring at? Go call him.
Let it go.
Hold on. You go call him.
Call him!
Let it go.
You go and get him.
Call him up.
Prakasha...
-Tell him to come now!
 -Letâ€™s not cause a scene.
This is Deepakâ€™s hotel.
Who the hell is he?
Priyaâ€™s husband.
Sit down.
You lured me here with the
 promise of a good fish meal.
Have you no shame?
Despite my telling you not to,
 you go and see her.
Heâ€™s not taking good care of her.
Look at the condition of this hotel!
Sheâ€™s not happy.
You ass, sheâ€™s not some fish meal!
Iâ€™m warning you Manu. This is not right.
Iâ€™m tired of warning you.
And if you go back to see her
 husband, son, dog and catâ€¦.
I will stop talking to you.
Okay come, letâ€™s go before he comes.
No.
He only comes here after 5 pm.
One minute...
What?
I forgot the key.
He should be more careful with your house keys.
Very irresponsible.
It could be 5 years or 10.
 Our life together will be waiting for you....
Our small little home...
And let me describe it for you...
Remember the house we paid and advance for?
Itâ€™s very similar to that one.
A big window in the hall.
And the house is filled with light.
I don't mind if its a small house.
 but we should keep it clean.
What is this Putti?
Is this your dream house?
The jail was much more nice than this.
Since youâ€™ll be the one cooking...
Set up the kitchen however you like.
I don't care.
As long as you feed me tasty food on time!
When you enter our bedroom...
It should feel like we're next to the sea...
All the walls painted blue...
You've come very far from the sea.
I want a separate wardrobe.
 Donâ€™t you dare come near it!
Do you know why?
When I showed you all the
 cinema tickets that I had collected...
You mocked me so much.
You called it â€˜trashâ€™, remember?
Not only cinema tickets...
Iâ€™ve collected all our memories in a box.
And when I miss you a lot,
 I open that box and go back in time.
Once you get out...
Just like that box,
 our house will be filled with memories.
So be ready to live life with all our â€˜trashâ€™.
Idiot...
Why did you do this Manu?!
Do I still have a small place
 amidst all your trash Putti?
After marriage, you will be doing the dishes right?
So start practicing now.
Wash it properly, it should shine.
Wait till we get married!
I thought of giving this to you
 but now I wonâ€™t.
You said Iâ€™ll get one in the evening!
Donâ€™t be so stubborn Puneeth.
Chocolate, please Amma?
Donâ€™t do this everyday!
Iâ€™ll come in only if you give me my chocolate.
Puneeth!
Take this, but this is the last one.
At least, you can teach a child!
Hey?
Hey! Stop!
Stop!
Who do you think you are?
Manu Anna?
It's been five months since I got out.
Manu Anna...
Anna...
I remember how you used to get me chocolates.
I hate sweets now.
Good that I didn't get any this time.
Priya?
My sister is doing fine.
My brother-in-law is also doing well.
They have a 7 year old son
They are happy.
Brother-in-law is a good man.
You will not find a single bad bone in him.
Where are you?
Iâ€™ve bought the alcohol.
What do you mean you canâ€™t come?!
Why didnâ€™t you tell me earlier?
Go to hell!
Hey?
Sir?
Get me some water...
One minute Sir... Iâ€™ll fill it up.
Thatâ€™s how it is here...
You have to get it yourself.
What next? Theyâ€™ll expect us to cook too.
I thought they wouldâ€™ve
 lived in a nicer house.
They did, earlier.
But...
Then what happened?
Tell me what happened, please?
Look Vinodha...
I am not looking to cause any trouble.
What happened? Tell me...
The usual scene with businesses
The ups and downs.
Brother-in-lawâ€™s hotel business
 was doing really well.
He had also opened two more branches...
...But this horrible Covid came...
Now Iâ€™m just running only
 the first hotel I owned.
The hotel is there, but
 there isnâ€™t any business.
What about you, Sir?
It looks like you repair people.
These scars are from the mistakes I made...
 when I was young and dumb.
Heâ€™s seen a lot of hardship.
Heâ€™s a positive man...
Extremely hard working.
Hey! Give me another large.
Coming sir.
Whatâ€™s the point of working hard in life?
Correct sir.
Nothing makes sense.
This is the only truth.
How is Priya?
Sheâ€™s fine...
Your...
I mean...
In the early days of marriage...
...She took her time.
Then everything became all right.
After the child was born, they are very happy
Does she still sing?
Sing?
What I mean is...
...she seemed to have lost her voice.
That was the last time.
I havenâ€™t seen her sing since then.
She hasnâ€™t sung even for her son.
Her job, home, son, brother-in-law...
She, herself, has forgotten that she used to sing.
Are you married, sir?
If these women start to quarrel...
... itâ€™s like those shows on TV.
Those soap operas...
They go on non stop...
At least, you can mute the TV.
I get why you want to see my sister...
But donâ€™t come there anymore.
Okay
Do you need change?
No
This is my friend, Prakasha.
This is Vinodha
Hi...
Priyaâ€™s brother.
It was good to see you.
Iâ€™ll make a move
I have some work. I forgot.
 Iâ€™ll see you later.
And donâ€™t introduce me as your friend.
Patil sir..
Did you understand all that I told you, sir?
These are the secrets of marriage, remember!
Iâ€™ll see you sir. Bye. Good night.
Here, take this.
Sister, where is the emergency ward?
Go straight and take a right.
Letâ€™s go?
Why?
You were stubborn about seeing her.
See her now.
Go watch her cry....
I donâ€™t know how to make you understand.
Your story is over.
 You will never be with her again!
Itâ€™s been 3874 days since she got married.
Memories of her haunt me day and night.
So I don't need you to remind
 me that our story is over!
-Then why do you...
 -Then why do I what?
I wanted to go live by the sea.
I went to see her one last time before I left.
I had hoped that she was happy with her family.
But her life is anything but that.
Before... when she was in a good mood or
 if she felt a bit of joy...
... she would unknowingly sing.
Now she has just stopped singing!
And you expect me to keep
 quiet knowing this?
You donâ€™t understand anything!
Thereâ€™s no problem.
He needs to be kept under observation.
Donâ€™t worry, you can take him today itself.
Thank you doctor.
Okay.
Beating up her husband wonâ€™t make her sing.
You were supposed to be a big singer Putti.
Canâ€™t you sing without me?
â€œThe cadence of the cool breezeâ€
â€œThe romance of the whisperâ€
â€œI'm a peacock dancing on the cloudsâ€
â€œAren't you the beat to my steps?â€
â€œThe sweet voice in my mind all alongâ€
â€œAren't you the melody to my song?â€
â€œMy love! You are the sea to my riverâ€
â€œMy love! I'll enshrine my life in yoursâ€
â€œI'll be a thousand words to your silent gazeâ€
â€œI'll be the gushing joy in the gleam of your eyes.â€
â€œYou are the wings to my soaring zealâ€
â€œYou're the sweet essence of all that I feelâ€
I used to sing for my happiness before...
I donâ€™t know when that changed...
Now I feel like singing for you.
Sir, what can I get you?
A coffee and tea.
Thatâ€™s all?
Just a minute.
Less sugar in the tea.
Ok sir.
Youâ€™ve lost weight.
Are you not eating well?
All well with you?
Yes.
You?
Iâ€™m awesome.
Here you go sir.
Wife?
Kids?
Just one wife!
idiot!
And her name?
Surabhi.
What about you?
How many kids?
One son.
One son, Puneeth.
My husbandâ€™s name is Deepak.
I hope youâ€™re happy.
Yes.
Very happy!
What about you?
Very happy!
Do you still sing?
Yesâ€¦
Iâ€™m so happy to see you!
Me too.
Iâ€™ll leave now.
My son will be waiting.
Manu...
Letâ€™s not meet ever again. Okay?
...Now I sing for you
I used to sing for my happiness
I donâ€™t know when it changed.
I used to sing for my happiness
Donâ€™t know when it changed.
Puneeth! Are you ready?
Wow! Sajjige!
Something special today?
Yeah!
So what is the occasion?
 Is it your birthday?
I don't know, my birthday
 is on October 6.
And amma has promised
 to buy me a cycle.
Will you take me on your cycle?
If you sit on my cycle, it will break.
So will you eat it all alone?
 Wonâ€™t you share with me?
No.
Here, have some.
 My mother makes it well.
Enough! Give it back.
Surabhi!
You forgot to take money.
Iâ€™ll call you.
It is used by a woman.
 She shouldnâ€™t have any problem starting it.
Give this to Priya.
Anna, I told you the other day itself ...
... to stay away from my sister.
I know.
Donâ€™t tell her it's from me.
You know...
...how fond of music she was..
Take it.
I promise to keep out of her way.
Sir always keeps his promises.
Please reduce the volume.
Give me that box.
Whatâ€™s this?
A gift.
Gift and you?
Someone must have
 left it behind in your auto.
You are very arrogant.
Everyone is listening to music,
 why arenâ€™t you Putti?
How are you feeling now?
Better sir.
Had you not come on timeâ€¦ thank you.
Thank you sir.
Who hit you?
I have no clue. Some b*****d for sure!
If I catch hold of him...
Anyway, forget it.
Go on, order. Itâ€™s on me today.
Even the other day, you paid the bill.
I feel like eating fish fry.
Not here sir. Itâ€™s awful.
Iâ€™ll take you to another hotel.
The taste of fish fry there is ...
... sir...
Give me a moment, sir.
What happened?
Why the long face?
Amma said she wonâ€™t buy
 me the cycle this year too.
Then what did she gift
 you on your birthday?
I got a good thrashing.
Why?
Because I asked for a cycle.
Did she fall short of money?
Yes, I think my father took it all.
My parents were having a major fight.
So shall I gift you a cycle?
No. I want to buy it with my money.
Okay, come here.
Cheer up.
Sit.
Take this.
What is this?
You can use this to go on all these rides.
No thanks.
Why?
Amma knows all my friends.
But she doesnâ€™t know you. If I
 come with you, sheâ€™ll shout at me.
Not with me. You go
 with your appa and amma.
Thereâ€™s a roller coaster
 and a giant wheel too!
Someone is doing charity during Covid.
Itâ€™s been long since we went out too. Letâ€™s go.
What are we doing here?
The tickets to the graveyard
 were sold out. So here we are.
Loafer.
2 tickets? Okay
Letâ€™s go fast?
Iâ€™ll come back in a minute.
Come, letâ€™s sit here.
Dashing cars was fun no?
Everyoneâ€™s so happy!
Makes you wonder what both of us
 are doing in a happy place like this...
Nothing of that sort.
 Iâ€™m always happy.
I don't ever feel sad
Is that so?
I donâ€™t feel pain.
Loafer.
Didnâ€™t you just say you donâ€™t feel pain?
So why would you do something like that!
A horse! I want to ride on it!
Donâ€™t run! Puneeth!
When I was young, somebody close
 to me broke my heart into pieces...
And I didnâ€™t bother to piece it back together.
Iâ€™ve collected all those pieces
 and have given it away to many people
But I havenâ€™t given away a piece that
 is large enough for anyone to hurt me.
So which piece have you given me?
Here....take.
Oof! Itâ€™s so heavy!
Oh no...
Itâ€™s okay, leave it.
One second...
One more...
Hello?
Sir, this is Deepak.
I had a missed call from you. Whatâ€™s up?
Whose number is this?
My phone is switched off. Iâ€™m
 calling from a friendâ€™s phone.
I thought of catching up with you.
Sir, Iâ€™m out out with family.
 Iâ€™ll meet you next week.
Okay.
Whose number is this?
Iâ€™m calling from a friendâ€™s phone.
Hello?
Hello. Lotus Massage Parlour.
 How can I help you?
Hello?
Hello Sir?
Surabhi?
Yes?
I need your help.
Come here.
I think this should fit you.
 If not, we can exchange it. Try it.
It's a small tear. Such a waste of money.
Now there's a big tear and worth the money.
Looks awesome on you.
If I stand at the circle theyâ€™ll
 mistake me for a traffic signal.
This is what suits you.
Itâ€™s nice.
So what favour do you want?
Not a favour. I need a job to be done.
If itâ€™s about that pretty princess â€¦
I am about to do some business with a guy...
He keeps going to a massage parlour.
Can you check what heâ€™s upto?
Hello, what happened?
Heâ€™s not that type.
Are you sure? Did you check properly?
What do you mean verify?
Should I have stripped in front him?
And asked if he wants to fondle me?
Tell me?
Thatâ€™s not what I meantâ€¦
Didnâ€™t I tell you heâ€™s not that type!
What are you staring at?
Is it because I said Iâ€™d strip?
Come, Iâ€™ll do that.
Just 1000 bucks! Iâ€™ll give you a discount, too!
Hey Surabhi.
Get a grip over your mood.
Got it?
Customers are complaining.
 Go get another job if you cant stop.
Who are you?
Where is Deepak?
He is not at home, come later.
Open the door!
Open it!
Go away. I told you he is not here.
Please donâ€™t come inside.
If he doesnâ€™t pay up by next month,
 we wonâ€™t let him go.
This is the last warning.
Three fish meals
Rs 250/-
Do you want soda, sir?
 Itâ€™s in the cooler.
Iâ€™m good.
Itâ€™s dirty around here. Iâ€™m short staffed.
Itâ€™s okay. Sit down.
The promised fish fry is here.
What sir?
Are you wondering why
 I have ordered fish from another hotel?
You read my mind.
Please eat.
Itâ€™s my friendâ€™s hotel.
 We started the business together.
You should go there during lunch hour.
Itâ€™s tough to get a table!
Before Covid...
...my hotel was like that too.
People would come searching for fish meals here.
After Covid, his business got back to normal.
You know what I miss the most sir?
The sound...
When a hotel is thriving,
 there is a certain sound.
The banter in the kitchen...
The cooker whistling...
Customersâ€™ chatter...
But now, everything is silent.
Even if I donâ€™t want to, I see his hotel everyday
I donâ€™t feel jealous of him, sir.
Heâ€™s a nice guy.
But...
... I crave the life he has.
His wife and child are so happy!
I am unable to provide that happiness to my family.
I dont why I was picked for this misfortune.
I used to believe that we have the
 capacity to write our own destiny.
But no, sir.
When you see your failure every passing minute...
... how can one find the strength to win?
Close this hotel and open another one.
Itâ€™s easier said than done sir.
I have to repay a loan of Rs 75 lakhs.
Our life has deteriorated completely from before...
I feel sad for my wife.
I've put her through a lot.
Sometimes, I feel like just ending my life.
It's just back luck sir.
Luck is for those who look for short cuts.
Not for the ones who work hard.
All will be well. Just wait and watch.
Come, letâ€™s have our drink.
Sorry sir.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Sorry!
Iâ€™ll get another glass.
To repay her debt...
Iâ€™ll have to work another 80 years
Nothing has changed.
Iâ€™m exactly where I was
 when we started out.
The debtors will not let go of her husband.
She will not let go of him
 and you will not let go of her.
And I will never give up on you.
Manu?
Why donâ€™t we commit theft,
 repay his loans
... and go back to jail?
Even Iâ€™m tired of
 driving this cab.
The first time you went to jail
 was for money, wasnâ€™t it?
But you ended up getting stabbed in the back.
Now letâ€™s get the money
 and go back to jail.
Good morning sir.
Good morning madam.
Madam?
Sir!.. Sir?
Who are you?
Madam?
Itâ€™s me Manu!
Sir, I used to work here before.
You need an appointment to go in.
Madam, it's me Manu.
Madam, two minutes...?
Madam!
Madam!
Madam! Listen to me...
Come with us sir.
Madam!
I hear you, but thereâ€™s a
 procedure we follow.
Just because you worked here
 before, you canâ€™t just barge in.
Yes sir, heâ€™s here in the lobby.
His name is Manu, sir.
Manu?
I donâ€™t know anyone by that name
Send him out.
Take him away.
Come sir.
One minute sir...
... Please let me speak to him sir.
Sir?
Sir?
Take him away quickly!
Sir?
Oh gosh!
Preethu...
Come here...
Itâ€™s very expensive one.
 Donâ€™t bother us again.
Thatâ€™s their compensation for
 the ten years I sacrificed!
B*****ds
We'll do something
 about this, don't worry.
Iâ€™ve spoken to the owner.
Heâ€™s promised to give us a good price.
 Donâ€™t worry.
Manu, come with me.
What happened?
You come with me, Iâ€™ll tell you
Manu!
Manu, listen to me...
How are you Manu?
When did you get out?
Letâ€™s go...
Letâ€™s go!
Wait man! Itâ€™s been so
 many years since I met him!
You look like a jamun now!
Shut up!
You know what Sunila?
I completely forgot to take revenge on this guy.
But thatâ€™s how the real world is!
What brings you here?
Ah! To ask for a loan perhaps?
Iâ€™ll give you a for a lower interest .
Come!
How much do you want, Manu?
Don't you want it? Just ask, donâ€™t be shy!
Manu!
Will I say no to you, Manu?
Manu, letâ€™s go. Iâ€™ll figure it out.
Hello.
The job is done.
Where should I come?
Wah! What a great arrangement!
If someone finds out, theyâ€™ll
 beat you black and blue...
And Iâ€™ll be part of that package deal.
All good? You counted 8 lakhs?
You obviously cannot go give the money to them.
So who is coming from Dubai for â€˜thisâ€™ deal?
Guru!!
No way!
Absolutely not!
I donâ€™t want to go back to jail!
I've had enough of you.
I made a mistake not whacking you the first time.
Have you no shame?
Vinodha...
Have you forgotten the ruckus those
 from the other day?
You're well aware of the loans and the interest.
Iâ€™ll stay behind the scenes.
 Prakasha will be the frontman.
Yeah. Yeah. Prakasha will be there.
You think itâ€™s easy to start a new hotel?
Youâ€™ve seen whatâ€™s happened before.
Letâ€™s not let a bad experience
 come in the way of business.
Donâ€™t talk about our
 family matters outside!
This is not a family matter.
Itâ€™s about business.
You are not even listening
 to what I have to say.
Iâ€™m listening uncle.
Youâ€™re a clever boy!
How do you know they are ok people?
I know they are....
Else I wouldnâ€™t have
 brought this up.
My friend Manoj, his brother.
He is a good man.
So we will be working under
 him because heâ€™s funding us.
Not at all.
It wonâ€™t be like that. Heâ€™s from Dubai.
Very good people
He will only invest. You
 will be running the show.
He will take a share in the profits
You speak to him about the details.
Please just meet him once.
If youâ€™re uncomfortable
 after that, weâ€™ll drop it.
Appa!
Amma says Okay.
When will they come?
We have to go and meet him.
To Dubai?
No, Mangaluru.
To Mangaluru?
Manu?
Manu? Please listen to me.
Try and understand.
 This is really difficult.
We still have time. Letâ€™s go back.
You were ready to commit robbery
 for my sake the other day.
This is nothing compared to that.
Get ready.
 Theyâ€™ll be here any moment.
Iâ€™ll be upstairs.
I said that as a joke.
 How can you take it seriously!
Yes...
Yes...
Sir?
Yes...
My brother-in-law.
This is Prakash.
Deepak.
Prakash.
Please sit.
Hmmm ... 2 years
Okay
Okay
Okay. Iâ€™m fine with all your terms.
This is the advance.
Your hotel should run well.
It will, sir.
Letâ€™s sign the agreement.
Okay sir.
I will pay the balance once you start work.
Okay sir.
In 2 months.
Letâ€™s hope for good things.
â€œOh Earthâ€
â€œThe shelter you've givenâ€
â€œUnveil the screen of memoryâ€
â€œHas the distant sea called the shoreâ€
â€œHave the waves shown the way to soarâ€
â€œHow did the mind clear up, can you tell?â€
â€œAs the Ganga flowed down heaven's stairwellâ€
â€œHow did I wait to bid you farewell?â€
Sorry. I hurt you a lot.
Not a â€˜lotâ€™
As much as a mosquito bite?
No. More than that.
If I can give you pleasure,
 I can also give you pain
Wait a minute, Sunila.
What is it?
I got his number. Iâ€™ve sent it to you.
Okay go!
Shall I go and give him a scare.
Get lost!
Letâ€™s go.
Helloâ€¦?
(singing a romantic song)
Manu...
Seeing you after so many years...
... has set my heart aflutter!
You and I are like that TV show...
Just like Tom and Jerry.
Hello?
Hello?
I didnâ€™t even say anything
I guess you must have
 forgotten your hearing aid.
Do you want me to be louder?
Can you hear me? Hello?
Hello?
Increase the volume
Do we take him now?
Not today.
Sir!
What was the purpose of your visit?
Iâ€¦
What?
Do one thing.
The next time you meet Manu...
... do a striptease and dance for him.
How do you even sit in this at home guys?
 Itâ€™s so uncomfortable.
Whatâ€™s your story now?
Give me another week.
Itâ€™s okay, take two weeks.
Take off the mask.
How old are you?
Nineteen.
Sheâ€™s quite the looker no?
Manu...
Do you have a lighter?
Soma Anna and I shall go to her house
 to show her some love.
Wait and watch.
Anna, he had called to say
 he found Manu's girl's house.
He wanted to show you her house.
Iâ€™ve told him everything.
Hereâ€™s Rs. 50,000
Okay.
Namaste sir.
Youâ€™ll have to vacate the house.
Yes, he is right here.
Okay, alright thanks.
Sir, let's go there by tomorrow morning at 10.30
Sir, I wonâ€™t come, but my friend will be there.
No Problem.
Pack properly, okay?
â€œLive like you should, forsaking a thousand worries and moreâ€
â€œJust the way the dark cloud lightens after a downpourâ€
Sir, this is unlike any of the
 houses youâ€™ve seen earlier.
Come in.
Itâ€™s exactly like what you said you wanted.
Let me show you.
This is the bedroom...
Really good ventilation...
â€œSweeping aside the stars adorning its wombâ€
See sir, thatâ€™s the kitchen.
Very good quality woodwork.
See, thereâ€™s a chimney too.
You will face no problems here.
Here take...
Use both your hands.
What are you doing?
Homework
You havenâ€™t filled this.
â€œJust the way as it disappears- the poor night of gloomâ€
Keep at it.
â€œLet my life be, my merciful Lord.â€
â€œLet my life be, my merciful Lord.â€
â€œStanding oneself in the hot burning sunâ€
â€œBestowing yet cool shade to everyoneâ€
â€œStanding oneself in the hot burning sunâ€
â€œBestowing yet cool shade to everyoneâ€
This house is the one!!
I will give the advance right away.
And...
One of the rooms need to be repainted.
Okay sir done.
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€
â€œJust the way the beech tree has always doneâ€
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€
â€œLive like you should, forsaking a thousand worries and moreâ€
â€œJust the way the dark cloud lightens after a downpour.â€
Hello?
Iâ€˜ve arranged a funeral lunch in memory of Kali.
Would be nice if you could make it.
Bring your girl, too.
Kaliâ€™s last wish was to meet her.
Who was that?
Wrong number
Hey, the bus is leaving, come fast!
Come live with me.
No.
Surabhi...
Surabhi!
Anna, Manuâ€™s here.
Namaste Officer.
Give Inspector Sir a leg piece.
Eat well boys!
Whatâ€™s up Manu. Youâ€™ve come alone?
If you had got your girl, Kaliâ€™s soul
 would have rested in peace.
Iâ€™ll organised one mourning ceremony.
Iâ€™ll bring her to the next one.
Serve me kebab.
How can I say no to you!
Iâ€™ll pack some for her too.
Hey, pack some kebabs.
Some kebabs for you.
Where is Soma?
I barely hung up the phone
 and youâ€™re here!
She didnâ€™t even let me party.
She's got me drunk.
Not here Soma.
Letâ€™s go out and talk.
Ah! I can hear now.
For this mole face?
Kali
Like I said Manu...
...Tom  Jerry.
Weâ€™re like lovers.
Who is Tom? Who is Jerry?
 You decide that.
Mole face...
You must know Apsara theatre.
That's mine
Iâ€™ll treat you to the night show.
Thatâ€™s to cover both your expenses.
Bye!
Where the hell is my pant woman?
Love you Manu.
Soma and I...
-Back in prison...
 -I didn't ask
Come in.
This is the house.
Our house.
The kitchenâ€™s this side.
Itâ€™s nice.
Itâ€™s a little empty.
A little?
Itâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ll fill it up.
Everything will be fine
How much longer Vinodha?
If he canâ€™t, ask him to let me know.
Iâ€™ll speak to him right now.
  Iâ€™ll call you back
Okay.
All okay?
Some money has to be arranged, sir.
Take the call, sir.
Not now.
Both of us share the same problem!
They have started work on the hotel
 The advance has been used up.
Akka is also really tensed...
Iâ€™ve run out of funds...
What do you want?
You like chocolate?
Deeksha! Come here!
Your name is Deeksha?
Ask your grandma to come sit here.
This has my bank details.
Give this to your grandma....
I will be waiting for the bank's notification.
By the way, Iâ€™ve added interest for the ten years.
Okay.
Donâ€™t bother us again.
And...
There was one other thing.
Ensure that madam and the
 familyâ€™s name is not revealed.
Rest will be paid after the job.
Iâ€™ll handle the rest.
The orders were from above...
 I cant do anything.
You're get paid on time...
 So why all this?
-Hey Sunila, come here
 -Anna
Call and tell the lawyer to come
 to the station quickly.
Okay anna.
Some big shot is behind this.
Everybody is tight-lipped.
Everyoneâ€™s has been bribed.
But...
Who have you provoked?
You start arranging for the bail.
 Donâ€™t worry about the money.
Okay, Iâ€™ll try to do that.
Hello?
We have arrested him and reopened his old cases.
Iâ€™ll arrange for the
 pending amount. Okay.
Hello madam...
Is the job done?
Yes madam itâ€™s done.
Iâ€™m at the old processing unit as instructed.
Itâ€™s a huge space.
It is a very good property.
What am I supposed to do here?
Hello?
Madam?
Hello?
Prabhu anna...
Madam wonâ€™t receive your phone call.
Iâ€™ve kept water for washing and drinking.
Iâ€™ll be back in two days with food.
Okay bye.
Hey!!!!
Hey Manu!
Hey Manu!
Manu!
Manu!
Iâ€™ve got the intimation from the
 bank. I wonâ€™t bother you again.
Manu!
Iâ€™ve transferred another two lakhs to Deepak.
Wait! Stop car!
Why? What happened!
Iâ€™ll be back
Take this.
Hey!!!!
Hey Manu!
Tell me how much you
 want! Iâ€™ll get it done!
Open the Door!
Hey!
Iâ€™ll send you in for 10 more years
You still havenâ€™t learnt your lesson.
You are one to talk.
Open the door...
Why all this sir?
You look good sir.
Good luck.
Your song has just released and its a superhit
Oye. Whatâ€™s on your mind?
â€œHas the wind songâ€
â€œblown along?â€
â€œThe journey unfinishedâ€
â€œThe destination obscured.â€
â€œTime is always specialâ€
â€œIt's like a far sailing vesselâ€
Hey... use this.
Use this to make one.
Give it here
My number is 16
You love singing right?
Letâ€™s get a clock for every room.
Loafer
Which one do you like?
I like this one.
Is it hanging properly?
Does it look cheap?
Itâ€™s working, thatâ€™s enough.
Where are you sir?
Iâ€™m out of town on work.
Why sir? Didnâ€™t I tell youâ€¦
Iâ€™m with you in spirit.
Once Iâ€™m back,
 my first meal will be at your hotel.
Please donâ€™t miss it.
â€œThe undisturbed small lightâ€
â€œThe passing time, yesterday, tomorrowâ€
â€œAnd today in you.â€
â€œTime is always specialâ€
â€œIt's like a far sailing vesselâ€
â€œWhy doesn't it wait or settleâ€
Did the function go smoothly?
Very nicely.
Priya?
She was very happy!
Do you want coffee or tea?
No
Manu... You are living in the same
 darkness, youâ€™ve kept Prabhu in.
Let him go...
Why donâ€™t you settle down?
Prabhu anna. The hotel has opened. Take this.
What happened Prabhu anna?
My grandson loves sweets.
Please Manu.
I canâ€™t bear it anymore.
Please let me go.
Iâ€™m going mad here! I canâ€™tâ€¦
I can't anymore. I don't
 know if it's day or night.
You'll wont know.
The stench, the dirtâ€¦
 all of lifeâ€™s memories haunt you.
Only that dark room knows....
How much youâ€™ve loved and...
how many people youâ€™ve cheated.
Iâ€™m beginning to
 understand my mistakes.
How much longer Manu?
She hasnâ€™t started singing yet...
[Announcement by Blind singing group]
You sing really well.
Whatâ€™s your name?
Shriya
Shriya.
These grapes are sweet!
Loafer!
What is this?
Hello,
One moment...
Yes Deepak.
Ok, coming.
Iâ€™ve to step out...
What happened?
You had said weâ€™ll have dinner together.
 And youâ€™re off now.
Now youâ€™re off now.
You go ahead.
You go ahead, Iâ€™ll eat outside
Iâ€™ll be late.
I didnâ€™t know who else to call sir...
Deepak sir...
Look at him sir...
This lying b*******d!!
He lied that he was from Dubai.
But in reality, heâ€™s a cab driver.
I caught him red handed at Sarakki signal
He cleared my loan.
Heâ€™s the one who funded the
 opening of this new hotel sir!
Iâ€™m not able to figure out his scheme.
He remains silent when I ask any questions.
What shall I do sir?
I know a place.
Letâ€™s take him there.
Okay sir.
Sirâ€¦?
What is this place?
Come
Come... careful
What kind of a place is this sir?
Looks abandoned.
Come, we can sit here.
Manu, thereâ€™s no water.
 The stench is unbearable!
Who is that sir?
One min, Iâ€™ll send some water.
Please send soon.
Itâ€™s okay sir.
Weâ€™ll settle this on our own.
Sir, the person inside is Prabhu.
Where do I start about this manâ€™s madness...
Deepak...
Deepak!
Deepak!
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other night!
I woke up because of a loud noise.
I tried so hard but I
 couldnâ€™t revisit that dream.
You know what that dream was?
The sea close to home
 that Iâ€™ve told you about.
Iâ€™ve taken you there.
Thereâ€™s not a soul in sight for miles...
Your wife must sing, sir.
Thatâ€™s the only cure to
 this fellowâ€™s madness.
Priya doesnâ€™tâ€¦
Your wife doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m alive.
And I donâ€™t want her to find out.
I know how much you
 love her and your family.
But youâ€™ve never seen the
 joy on her face when she sings.
Thereâ€™s still time.
Give me this!
Take this sir.
Take it
First, ask him to delete that audio.
Correct sir. Iâ€™ll get it deleted
Hey! Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!
Give it now.
Saving the cassette was my mistake.
Prakasha...
Look here sir. Itâ€™s deleted.
Okay now?
Please take this sir.
Please make her sing sir.
I beg you! For my sake, make her sing!
What the hell kind of a fix is this....
Putti?
Youâ€™re still awake?
Idiot...
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other night!
Putti...
Who the hell is Putti?!!
Who the f**k is she?!!
Who is she?
Didnâ€™t you find anyone
 else to satisfy your desire?!!
Answer me!
Answer me!
Why didnâ€™t you find a
 railway track instead!
Tell me you a*****e!!!
You want to mess with me?
You want to listen to her sing right?
Listen to it, go ahead!
Youâ€™ll find nothing...
Iâ€™ve burnt them all to ashes!
Today Iâ€™ve burnt this! Tomorrow Iâ€™ll burn everything!
That b****h, Iâ€™ll burn her too!
You will never be able to fill her place.
You can put the fall for this
Could you show the back?
Is there another colour?
Yes Madam, there are other colours
Nothing is nice at this store!
I know how to screw you B**h
Iâ€™m hungry Manu.
Yesterday also you were late.
Iâ€™m starving.
Wait Prabhu anna.
How many more days should I suffer?
Sunila...
...the biryani was nice, wasnâ€™t it?
It was super anna!
I feel like eating something sweet now.
Shall I get you some?
Go fetch Manuâ€™s girl instead.
Okay.
You want to hurt me As**%*e?
Iâ€™ll show you...
Iâ€™ll know how to screw you over...
Youâ€™ll see what Iâ€™ll do to that B*#*h.
You watch....
Oye mole face!
Comeâ€¦ let me console you.
Come baby!
Sunila!
This table is making some funny sounds.
(local slang for sex worker)
Take her away. I canâ€™t bear her whining.
Your mother used to tell me
 that you sing really well...
Why donâ€™t you give it a try?
Nothing will happen, come
What will you do if she sings today, Manu?
I plan to go and settle by the sea.
If I open the tap, the fish must
 fall right into the bucket!
And what about me?
What sweet does you grandson like?
Surabhi?
Listen to me please...
Priya is an old chapter
I havenâ€™t met her either
Tell me where you are...Iâ€™ll come...
...Who is Priya, Manu?
Another babe?
Wonâ€™t you introduce me to her?
Get her Manu, letâ€™s party together
Manu...
Prakasha...
Take this Madam, 1st floor
Take Amma, sing well
There are a lot of people
 .youâ€™ll have to stand in the queue
Ohh is it?!
Where is Surabhi?
Aye Manu!
Where is she?
Where is Surabhi?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Iâ€™ll tell!
Iâ€™ll tell you!
It felt good when you choked me Manu
Boys! Get everyone!
Sunila!
Sunila!
Manu...?
Manu...
That's it boys, lock him up!
Aye, Sunila! Come fast...
Manu...
Manu...
Manu... Manu... Manu...
Sunila!
Sunila!
Hey Sunila!
Boys, get here now!
Bheema! Come fast!
Call everyone!
Come quickly!
Aye! Donâ€™t spare him
Cut him up!
Go! Go! Go!
Surabhi!
Su.. Surabhi...
Give me the bag...
All the best!
All the best amma!
I am Priya Deepak.
Contestant #60.
Song is from the
 film Bisilu Kudure...
â€˜Kadalanu Kaana Horatiroâ€™
Sing please!
Surabhi!
Manu...
Letâ€™s talk it out Manu...
Listen to me
Hey mole-face!
We make a good pair.
You are dumb and I'm deaf.
Surabhi...
Priya!
Priya!
Listen to me...
Itâ€™s time Prakasha...
If anything were to happen...
You know what to do with the money...
Manu!
Manu!
I won't let anything happen to you.
I didnâ€™t realize that I had given a
 small peice of my heart to you
Nothing will happen to you.
 I will go fetch the Doctor.
You didn't tell me your real name...
A â€˜Doctorâ€™ before your name will look nice...
Nothing will happen.
 I will go get help!
Putti, donâ€™t stop singing...
â€œThe cloud seems shy on its way to meet the seaâ€
â€œThe evening ray colouring the sky asks, shall I join theeâ€
â€œThere's a boat is sailing far yonderâ€
â€œDisappearing in its isolation into a blurâ€
â€œIs this a dream somebody drewâ€
â€œShall I name it after you?â€
â€œA name I've forgotten though...â€
I tried so hard but I
 couldnâ€™t revisit that dream.
You know what that dream was?
The sea close to homeâ€¦
Iâ€™ve taken you there...
Thereâ€™s not a soul in sight for miles...
Just you, me and the sea.
We were walking right next to the sea...
The waves were wiping away our footprints...
I was holding your hand tightly.
We were so happy, you know?
Even now, if I close my eyes, I can
 hear the sound of the waves
Do you also hear it?
â€œWaves after waves...â€
â€œYet no sign of the shore.â€
â€œIn the tune you eschewedâ€
â€œUnknown I shall remainâ€
â€œAn unrecallable remembranceâ€
â€œThe cloud seems shy on its way to meet the seaâ€
I wonâ€™t stop singing...
Idiot...
Donâ€™t feel bad that Iâ€™m leaving.
I think the sea was my destiny...
I have no regrets anymore...
Iâ€™m not going alone...
Iâ€™m taking small pieces of you along with me...
Two fish fries...
My story is now a part of the sea.
The last chapter of that story...
...Is yours to fill.
Come letâ€™s go.
