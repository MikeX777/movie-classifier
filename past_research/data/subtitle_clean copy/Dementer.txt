Well, er... I've kindajust done
odds and ends to get by, er...
You know, waitress, cleaning.
I just really would like a job
doing something
where I could feel
like I was doing something good.
This is our training room.
We don't get to use it that often, but
it's great to have when we get to use it.
We help support individuals
with disabilities in the community
to live in their homes
and have lives just like you and I.
And here's our kitchen
where the dsp stores serve food
and prepares their lunches.
The hours are kinda crazy.
You come in
and work two days on.
Then you come back
and work two nights on
- and you have to stay awake all night.
- Ok.
I... I don't sleep much anyway
so that'll be fine.
This is the area they come in
if they want to do puzzles or whatnot.
- And this is Patricia.
- Hi.
Patricia, can you say hi
to my friend, Katie?
How are you?
Hi, Barbra.

They love working on puzzles.
Pretty.
We usually hang them up
but we got a couple
that rip them off the walls.
If they get tired
they can rest in there or whatever.

Is what their medications they get,
what the doctor prescribes,
all health information.
We use this room
for physical therapy.
If they're sick and wanna take a nap,
they'll just come in here and lay down.
You make sure you keep
your medications locked at all times.
And you lock the door
when you go out.
You'll get used to it,
it ain't no big deal.
That's a lot.
