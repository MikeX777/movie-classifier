(SWITCH CLICKS)
ED: It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.
NURSE 1: What's an inhuman spirit?
ED: It's something that's
never walked the earth in human form.
It's something demonic.
NURSE 2: So, the doll
was never possessed?
LORRAINE: No, it was used as a conduit.
It was moved around
to give the impression of possession.
Demonic spirits don't possess things.
They possess people.
It wanted to get inside of you.
And given this unusual feature,
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.
- Cared for?
- ED: Mmm-hmm.
It should be destroyed.
(ED SIGHS)
That would only make things worse.
We think it best the doll come with us.
We'll keep it somewhere safe.
That sounds like a great idea.
She's all yours.

How much longer, do you think?
Eh, about an hour.
Why don't you put your head back?
Get some rest.
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.
(CHUCKLING) If I do that,
we might end up in California.
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.
- Nothing wrong with that.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
I'll pick up Judy on the way.
Ah, that actually sounds so nice, Ed.
We should plan on it.
ED: Uh-oh.
What's this?
(TURNS OFF MUSIC)
You folks need to turn around.
Pretty bad accident up ahead.
Uh, anything we can do?
You a doctor or something?
Or something.
He just meant if you need
an extra set of hands.
Yeah.
We got it covered. Thanks.
Nice doll.
That's what you think.
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.
- Twenty-six. Got it.
- Thank you, Officer.
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)
OFFICER: A guy and his doll.

(POP ROCK PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)
I think we missed our turn.
We didn't miss it.

Bridgewater? Old Ridge Road.
Where did you get Bridgewater from?
You know what?
I think we missed our turn.

Well, be careful.
There we go.

The curse of the Lord is in the house
of the wicked.
But he blesseth

Surely, he scorneth the scorners,

The wise shall inherit the glory,

We need another barrier of protection.

I agree.
The blessing will only do so much.
That chapel glass we got from

Well, and take your time, we'll be fine.

Well, it's just a couple more hours

MR PALMERI: Mrs. Faley,
it's right over here. Let me show you.
How could you not tell me
what the Warrens did for a living?
Shouldn't you be in math class?
DANIELA: Mary Ellen!
I babysat the Smiths for over two years
and never told you what they did.
Oh, what do they do?
They're podiatrists.
- So not the same.
- (CHUCKLES)
Well, obviously, I'm coming over later.
We do have that social studies project
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...
We don't have any project.
Okay, but how would they know?
She's psychic.
Then, they're heroes.
I think they're concerned parents
who wouldn't want negative influences
around their child.
What negative influence?
'Cause I sometimes stay out past curfew?
Among other things.
So, what's it like inside the house?
Is it all creepy music and cobwebs?
No. No, it's boring suburbia.
The inside of your locker is scarier.
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?
Judy's birthday is coming up,
so we're gonna celebrate early.
You really are the best babysitter,
you know that?
Compliments will get you nowhere.
What about threats?
Did you happen to notice
who's working checkout?
- BOB: Have a good one.
- WOMAN: Will do.
- Thank you so much.
- BOB: See you soon.
You wouldn't.
You know what they call him, right?
What?
(DANIELA SIGHS)
Bob's-Got-Balls.
How you doing?
Hi, Daniela.
(INHALES)
(EXHALES)
(CHUCKLES) Uh...
Hi, Mary Ellen.
(STAMMERS) Is this everything?
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?
- BOB: Uh...
- Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting
for them tonight.
Yeah.
Yeah, I live right across the street.
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?
Like a ghost, maybe?
Bob...
Mrs. Faley went ahead and dropped
a can of tomato sauce in aisle five
and it looks like a crime scene,
so get the mop.
- Ladies. Did you find everything okay?
- Yes, sir.
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?
- (CHUCKLES) No.
- No.
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.
I'll do it right after.
So, what'd you see?
At the Warrens'?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.
- (CASH REGISTER DINGS)
Your total is $3.50, so...
Oh.
But you knew what the Warrens did?
There were rumors, I guess, but...
Rumors. Interesting.
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?
Wait, really?
(STAMMERS) What is it about?
Uh, it's about a girl who has a...
(WHISPERS) Fine. You can come. Stop.
- BOB: Oh. Sorry.
- MARY ELLEN: Sorry.
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.
- (CASH REGISTER DINGS)
- Um... So, what...
Bye, Bob. Thanks.
Bye.
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...
Here.
She likes you.
(CHUCKLES)
There's been an accident.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
(STUDENTS CHATTERING)
Don't touch her.
You'll get obsessed.
- It's "possessed."
- ANTHONY: That's what I said.
Anyways, if you know so much,
why don't you tell us
if you can catch cooties from a ghost?
You can't.
Well, then how'd you get 'em?
- (KIDS LAUGH)
- MARY ELLEN: Anthony Rios!
Don't make me get your sister.
Please don't.
Then go. All of you. Come on.
BOY: Come on. Let's go!
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.
You can't either?
My parents said I'm not really prepared
to process death yet.
It's a birthday party.
GIRL: I'm sorry.
MARY ELLEN: Hey, how long
has that been happening?
JUDY: Since everyone heard
about the article this week.
Please don't tell my parents.
I won't. I won't as long as you do.
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.
They're worried about everything
whether they need to be or not.
Are you sure the bullying is
the only thing that's bothering you?
That isn't bothering me.
MARY ELLEN: You know what I mean.
And remember our deal. No secrets.
JUDY: I know.
I don't have any.
What did you get at the store?
A surprise.
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

I was knocking on the door
for, like, 10 minutes.
(SIGHS) How did you even get in?
Back door. Is this a spirit bell?
- (BELL JINGLES)
- What's a spirit bell?
It tells you if you're in the presence
of any spirits.
- So, it is one.
- JUDY: No.
It's just a bell. My mom collects them.
- (TURNS OFF MUSIC)
- Oh.
Who are you?
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.
Oh, good!
I love cake.
So, Judy.
Don't your parents keep
any creepy stuff around?
JUDY: No.
They keep it all locked away in a room.
Well, can we at least go in and look?
MARY ELLEN: No!
It's not really good for anyone
to go in there.
How come?
Just isn't.
Wait.
Here.
Birthday present.
What is it?
DANIELA: Look inside.
Mmm? (CHUCKLES)
(POP ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
MARY ELLEN: How did you
even afford those?
DANIELA: They're my old ones.
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm
the first time I put them on.

- You're kidding.
- (RATTLING)
- She looks way more coordinated.
(SIGHS) They're gonna ruin the floors.
Can we go around the block, then?
- I don't think...
- DANIELA: Good idea.
You guys go. I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.
Fine. But don't snoop. Don't touch.
Don't do anything. Please?
Stay in the kitchen. Promise me.
I promise.

She'll never know.
How'd it go with the skates?
She loved them
until she fell on the way back
and skinned her knee.
Better than breaking her arm.
Where is she anyway?
She's out feeding the chickens.
They have chickens?
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)
DANIELA: Hey. How's your knee?
Oh. (GROANS)
Looks like your jeans
will at least need some stitches.
It's okay.
Accidents happen.
So, are you scared yet?
Scared? What? No.
Who says they're scared?
Kids in my class.
Anthony Rios started it.
I hate him.
Wait. Tony Rios started it?
Do you know him?
Yeah, he's my brother.
Anthony Rios is your brother?
Yeah, I know. Don't hold it against me.
I don't like him either.
You know, he still wets the bed.
You didn't hear it from me.
Or maybe you did, I don't care.
Still, just...
go a little easy on him.
It's been a tough year.
You lost somebody, didn't you?
My dad. Uh...
Did Mary Ellen tell you?
No.
I just knew.
- Um, for delivery.

There's no Annabelle here.
Yes, she is.
She's right behind you.

People are just...
They're really weird about death.
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.
It scares them.
They treat it like it's some disease
they don't wanna get
even though everyone already has it.
But here's the thing.
I used to think it was fatal and whammo.
It's, like, out.
Like turning off a TV.
Then I learned about your parents
and their whole exploration
into the afterlife and stuff...
and they gave me hope.
That maybe life goes on somehow.
Maybe...
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.
"Darling dad"?
It was a thing.
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...
Stupid. (CHUCKLES)
He's still out there, you know.
You think so?
My parents would say he is, too.
MARY ELLEN: Where are you going?
Be right back.
(VOICE BREAKING) Dad?
Daniela?

What's going on?
What happened?
Nothing.
Judy...
I just got scared.
Scared of what?
Sometimes...
I see things.
Like how my mom sees things.
You mean like ghosts?
Where do you see them?
Everywhere I go.
Judy...
Ghosts used to be people.
And not every person you meet is bad...
so maybe not all ghosts are bad, either.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Daniela.
- You have to see this.
- MARY ELLEN: What?
It's this case the Warrens investigated
about this girl
who was terrorized by something
called the Ferryman.
Here's a picture of the girl he killed.
Look familiar?
I mean, you two could be sisters.
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.
Look at all this stuff.
(GASPS)
How cool.
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.
MARY ELLEN: The Black Shuck?
DANIELA: It was a case
the Warrens investigated
about a hellhound
that possessed a man in England.
He terrorized the shit out of this town.
What's with the coins over their eyes?
What?
DANIELA: Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead
to pay the Ferryman, so he could take
their souls to the underworld.
It was his toll.
Okay, we should go.
It's okay.
I sometimes like to snoop, too.
DANIELA: Do you know
what this does, Judy?
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.
- What's that?
- Um...
It's a case
my parents investigated recently.
The wedding dress.
It haunts people.
And it makes them violent.
Where is the dress now?
Down the hall in the artifact room.
I mean, that's where all this stuff is.
Right, Judy?
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...
Yeah.
My dad says that everything in there
is either haunted, cursed...
or used in some ritualistic practice.
What about the doll that's in there?
Because I read this interview
with your dad...
No.
Don't talk about her.
Why not?
She's in a case for a reason.
Okay, we should go.
- I wonder what's on this.
- MARY ELLEN: No, Daniela! Wait!
(WHIRRING)
I command you, unclean spirit,
along with all your minions,
I command you
to obey me to the letter!
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.
Do something
that's actually appropriate.
DANIELA: Come on, don't you
at least wanna hear about the samurai?
What about this one?
I don't remember that one.
DANIELA: How do you play?
Let's find out.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay. Okay, so you draw a card,
and whatever picture it has on it
is the object you try to find
by feeling around inside the box.
If the object you pull out matches
the picture, then you get a point.
You go first.
Okay.
(OBJECTS RATTLING)
(DOORBELL RINGING)
You gonna get that?
Yeah.
Sorry, you guys keep playing.
Oh, got a point.

Yeah. Yeah.

Anyways, that's why I'm here.
Oh.
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.
I just, uh...
I mean, I would, but...
(CHUCKLES) well...
I just knew you were gonna be here...
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.
Bob's-Got-Balls!

Are you two, like...
I... I wish. (CHUCKLES)
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?
- Woo her?
- PIZZA GUY: Yeah.
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.
You mean girls like Mary Ellen.
What did I say?
Guys.
(GUFFAWING)
So, how do I woo her?
PIZZA GUY:
There's only one way to woo.
It's obvious.
Rock and roll.

Thanks, and that means
you can keep this.
(CHUCKLES) Minus one slice.
I enjoyed that in the car.
(SNAPS FINGERS) See you later, Balls.
I would invite you in,
but like I said...
No, yeah, it's cool.
I thought I'd just stop by
and say hi, I guess, so...
I'm glad you did.
Me, too.
Hey, Bob, um...
how come they call you that?
Um...
Well, you know how I'm the equipments
manager for the basketball team?
- Yeah.
- That's why.
There's not really, like,
a story or anything behind it.
Just like, "Hey, I need balls."
I'm, like, "I got it. Balls. Got 'em."

He had silver coins for his eyes.
She said his light shows you
the way to the land of the dead.
I just wanna find my sister.
ED (ON SPEAKERS):
And when did she first see him?
GIRL: Not long before he took her.
She said she'd wake up,
and he'd be in her room...
watching her sleep.
The night she went missing,
we both woke up to a noise.
It sounded like a coin
falling on the floor.
She told me to wait in her room.
So I did.
She never came back.
I went to look for her
and ended up in a long hallway.
Filled with coffins.
(TEARFULLY) Last night...
I woke up to a noise.
Another coin being dropped.
(SOBBING SOFTLY) It was like he was...
