We can see the drones.
They look like birds.
The drones are circling this area
24 hours a day.
Two or three at the time. There are always
two. Most days three or four.
When the kids, or I, hear the drones,
we get scared.
We can neither work,
play or go to school.
When the weather is cloudy,
they don't show up.
The organization ‘FOUNDATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS’
brought an action against the CIA use of drones in 2010.

from our village is the cemetery.

My brother is buried
in this cemetery.
Some people from the village were
digging a new grave next to his.
I was upset by the thought,
of what could have happened.
Was someone in my family dead?
I didn't know who it was.

When the attack happened
I was working out in the fields.
Everyone shouted and screamed.
My mother were outside, sorting
vegetables, when she was hit.
The children were struck
when the second missile hit.
A fragment of the missile
got stuck in my leg.
I was brought to the hospital.
It was not before coming
home from the hospital -
- that I was told
that my grandmother had been killed.
It was a horrible day.
It felt apocalyptic.
I often contemplate, why they
would kill us innocent people.
Everything is different now. We can't go to school
and we can't play outdoors anymore.

I try to travel to the areas where
drone attacks happen to take photos.
I want to gather evidence
and show the world what is happening here.
There are always people who
search in panic for their lost family.

A lot of people have
become mentally ill -
- because of attacks on town meetings,
shops and schools.
There is no place, where
a drone attack has not happened.
The drone attack of august 2010
was horrendous.
On the ground, scattered,
were children.
Their parents ... They were
still lying there the morning after.
I will never forget that sight.
Three children survived.
The pressure waves from the drone strike
threw them out to the side.
The worst thing about the attack was
that the kids recognized their brothers.
They said: "That's my brother,
and that's my brother."
Here, the kids couldn't recognize -
- their mother and father -
- because these stumps is all -
- what was left of their parents.
They couldn't understand
that their parents were killed.
They started to cry and shouted:
"I want my mum and dad!"
Every night when I fall asleep
I can hear the children scream
