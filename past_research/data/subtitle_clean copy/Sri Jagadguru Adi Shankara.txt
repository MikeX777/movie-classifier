About 2000 years ago,
well known as land of Dharma and Karma,
as holy land,
our country India was famous,
when it turned into a battlefield
of castes and religions,
when ignorance took over
the common sense,
when people killed people
without any sense or reason,
when the foundations
of theism is shaken,
when the places of holy
sacrifices are shut down,
in the state of Kerala,
in a village known as Kaladi,
Aadi Shankara was born,
he took to Sanyasa as little boy,
wrote hundreds of holy scripts,
he walked from Kanyakumari
to Kashmir 4 times,
he unified 72 religions into one
and become Jagadguru, a world teacher!
Aadi Shankara lived in this
world for just 32 years only.
Had he not born, who would've
shown direction to Hindu religion?
Would the Dharma of Ashram
survived in this world?
Would unity in diversity
be possible in India?
Many such doubts would rise
in our hearts.
Principles of Lord Shiva
is our principles,
that is humanity,
he preached this to the world,
he became a dot on forehead
of Hindu religion,
that messiah.
Arise, awake and stop not until
you reach the destination,
with this clarion call awakening
the conscience of Indian nation,
Swami Vivekananda, a guide to the youth,
was inspired by Aadi Shankara!
The path shown by Jagadguru
is for everyone.
Let's understand his teachings.
Let's follow it.
He's the first Guru of Hindi religion,
that's why he's Jagadguru!
Who am I?
Who you are?
Who is God?
Who is human?
Which Guru? Who is disciple?
Who is the giver?
Who is the bearer?
Who knows this?
Who gets us to know?
What is start? What is the oldest?
What is spirit? What is not?
What is knowledge? What is false?
What is illusion? What is mystery?
What is Dharma? What is the aim?
What is peace? What is happiness?
Why these sorrows?
Why this destruction?
When will this end?
What is birth? What is death?
What is good deed? What is sin?
What is time? What is Karma?
What is bond? What is delusion?
What is truth? What is perennial?
Where is change? Where is the path?
Who will lead us to that path?
Where is he? When will he arrive?
Why are the planets losing path?
A great man is about to be born.
Planets are falling into places
to make him a great man.
It never happened before.
A man like him was also
not born earlier.
Why are you falling at child's feet?
It'll reduce his lifespan.
What are you looking, Shankara?
I see a Sadhu there, father.
Shankara, I brought you here
at midnight, aren't you afraid?
If I was afraid,
why would I come with you, Swami?
God gave you just 8 years only.
Do you know that?
Now that you've told me, I know it.
What do you know?
You're 4 years old now.
4 years from now...
- I'll leave this body, right Swami?
Are you not afraid of death also?
Death is inevitable after birth.
Birth is inevitable after death.
What is inevitable,
why should we cry about it?
Great! You're here to teach the world,
how can you he scared of anything?
Did you bring this far
to tell me this, Swami?
No, to impart you the divine
knowledge of Srichakram.
If you do it with devotion,
Goddess of Wealth will come on your order,
and will not leave even if you say,
Everyone says my son would
become an ascetic.
If one offers prayers everyday to
Goddess Lakshmi what would he become?
A wealthy man!
What would my son become then?
He would become a wealthy
man of knowledge.
Looks like you've found a new game.
Game is old but I'm trying to
play it in another new way.
They say our shadow is death.
Generally death plays with us.
What if we play with death?
Goddess will come down!
Jambasura's head will break!
Break, one more word about our
religion, I'll break your heads.
To hell with you!
With centuries of history
for our pious religion,
what the hell is your religion?
Is there anything worth
in your religion?
Don't say like that, I'll hang you
to death with my sacred thread.
What the hell did you say?
Beat them. . . kill them!
I-low dare you talk about our religion!
I'll kill and bury you here!
I'll show you who am I!
Your religion worthless!
Stop...stop!
Don't stop!
Beat yourselves to death!
Population problem would ease
and country would prosper.
Stop...don't fight!
What happened, hubby?
What happened;
Shankara! Why so many differences
though generations are changing?
Clashes in the name
of communities.
Unleashing death in
the name of religions.
In human. . . uncivilized!
What happened;
Hubby!
Why are you crying;
Like birth, death too is
a celebration.
Pray to Lord Krishna.
Lord Krishna, I seek refuge in you...
Lord Krishna, bless me...
Lord Krishna...
Lord Krishna, I sing in your praise...
Lord Krishna, you chant is meditation...
Lord Krishna, you're knowledge...
Lord Krishna, you're the saviour...
Lord Krishna, you're the giver...
Lord Krishna, you're the bearer...
Lord Krishna, you're the creator...
Lord Krishna, you're the
one to merge with...
With centuries of history
for our pious religion,
what the hell is your religion?
Is there anything worth
in your religion?
What are you pondering over, Guru?
Every one of us must end up
as ashes one day.
I reduced my father to ashes
with my hands.
I'm thinking about how to
reduce ignorance to ashes.
Why don't you chant it?
Yesterday you used acute accent,
today you used it differently,
which is right?
Yesterday's or today's?
Hey boy! It's my damn thing!
Why don't you accept whatever it is?
I'll tell him.
You joined the class recently and
started correcting teacher himself,
you will become a great Vedic scholar.
I want to become a Sanyasi.
So be it!
Give me alms, mother!
Give me alms, mother!
God in my home is starving
for lo days now,
I offered this berry to God.
I can't offer anything else.
My son Shankara! I wish you get
married as a little boy.
Mother, I wish to become
a Sanyasi as a little boy.
Guru! Don't go further deep,
there are crocodiles.
Shankara will complete 8 years today.
Death is inevitable!
God gave him just 8 years only.
Mother. . . mother. . .
- Son!
Crocodile has caught me, mother.
- Mother!
Please don't enter the water, mother.
To increase his lifespan?
- Can increase another 8 years, but...
What am I to do now?
Someone must sacrifice 8 years
of their life to him.
Who would do it?
- I...I'll sacrifice my life.
Mother. . . mother...
Tell him, you can become a Sanyasi!
It seems crocodiles will not hurt Sanyasis.
Mother, crocodile will leave
if you allow me to become Sanyasi.
Permit me, mother!
Permit him to become Sanyasi, mother.
- As you wish son.
I permit you to become a sanyasi, son!
What' s this pk'; with mother, son'.?
Neither I played with you
nor lied to you, mother.
The crocodile of bondage held me.
I accepted to become sanyasi
on your order.
Crocodile left me.
Son Shankara!
Promise your mother and go.
I must see you before I die, son!
You must conduct my funeral rites.
Put your hand on my head,
promise me and then proceed.
As you wish, mother!
You're getting so sentimental about
that child and his acts, my foot.
He'll roam around like
a squirrel for few days,
he'll start feeling hungry,
he'll come back home.
That's the word of Vedic scholar!
Didn't get me?
My word is like Veda!
I've one small wish in my life, hubby.
I wish to see you beg like sanyasi
in loin with a begging bowl.
Hail Lord Shankara!
Hail Lord Shiva!
What's your illusion!
Wow! What a great artwork
this nature is!
My heart is swept away by
its beauty, pomp and splendour...
Like kiss of festivities...
Like a lamp of wonders...
Like a soaring mat of delight...
Like some divine magic...
Flowing waters of
wonderful waterfalls. . .
It's dancing to the
rhythm of ﬂames...
Like a desire of beautiful earth
joining the vast sky at horizon...
The nature is thrilled and taking
breathe amidst the bamboos...
As wind whistles like
a mischievous youth...
Like a union of all
living forms into one...
Becoming one power and one breathe...
like the holy monosyllable...
Why are you going that side?
What will happen if I go that side?
There's danger ahead.
Oh! Danger?
Then, I'll go that side only.
Looks like, he'll change the country.
Lord Shankara!
You don't look like an ordinary sage,
are you a sage king?
You're doing the act of
controlling fire, right?
Guru, I too want to learn this.
Come, I'll teach you!
Come, I'll show my prowess.
How is the valley?
- Wonderful!
If anyone falls,
he may never come back!
May be but if one has hope of
coming back, may try jumping into it.
Then, think so,
jump and come back.
If you come back, I'll teach you
all the knowledge I have.
If one gets educated,
anyone can come up in life.
I like you, Shankara!
If 10 dedicated people like you
take on this society,
ignorance, duplicity, fanaticism
will vanish from this country.
Come, I'll impart knowledge to you.
Shankara has transferred his life
to another form.
His life in fish now.
8 years you gave him ends today!
Anyone can give another 8 years but...
I'll sacrifice another 8 years
from my life to Shankara.
What are those fishes telling?
Birth and death are same,
when will humans learn this?
Catch the bastards who are
torturing common people,
make them bend and
stand in a line,
rip out their skins, that's all!
Never show mercy on those
sons of bitches!
Yes, I'm her son!
She's my mother!
But still I'll not conduct her funeral.
To conduct her funeral,
I need a bag of money.
Then, more money for rites
and obsequies.
For feast, I need more money.
Money, more money,
I can't spend anything.
Corpse!
Bloody son!
I yearned so much for a son!
Will you refuse to cremate me
for giving birth to you?
Hey you...
I raised you with great
difficulty, son!
Are you finding it diﬂicult
to cremate me, son?
Mother!
When you wetted on me, I felt like
I took a holy bath in river Ganges.
Are you thinking about money
to conduct my funeral, son?
Tell me before I hit you
with slippers,
mother, please forgive me,
I'll conduct your funeral, tell!
Tell!
- Mother!
Tell son! Tell!
Tell!
- Mother!
I'll conduct your funeral, mother.
Do you think only toughness can
bring sense to humans?
These mountains, valleys,
forests, birds, animals,
currents, streams,
star, livers and rivulets,
all remain unpolluted as they were
when they came into existence,
only rnan...just only man,
he's building webs of castes,
clans, religions around him,
he's going crazy with selfishness,
I, my wife, my children,
my grandchildren,
and their future generations,
he amassing wealth to
last many generations,
money...money...money...
He's steeping down to any
low level for money!
Money took birth and humanity died.
To change this world of sin,
I gave up throne, kingdom,
queen and children.
Roamed all around the country
like a mad man,
I learnt mantras and tantras,
but I understood this power will not help
to win over evil or change the world.
Think, Shankara!
Think what to do to change
this world!
Think over it!
This is mother in Telugu, Mother in Hindi,
mother in Tamil,
mother in Malayalam,
mother in Kannada,
Mother...
- In Sanskrit!
Mother, our Shankara is
a scholar of eight languages.
May you be blessed with great teacher!
Who are you, son?
Form of eternal happiness,
hail Lord Shiva!
Have you come to me as an answer
to my prayers, Shankara?
I'm here to be blessed
as your disciple.
You're guru of all gurus!
In fact you've blessed me.
When I see you I feel like holy
Mt.Kailash is wrapped in saffron
You'll be well known as Paramahamsa,
a great philosopher!
Karma yoga is contemplation of duty.
Vignana yoga is knowledge of
scientific contemplation,
Pragathi yoga is progress of
contemplation of self confidence,
Karuna yoga is contemplation
of non-violence,
Buddhi yoga is
contemplation of speech,
Dhyana yoga is
contemplation of breathe!
I'm seen is so many mirrors,
though I'm seen in so many mirrors,
I'm not that many, right?
I'm only one!
They're all my images!
Supreme soul is one,
all others are his images!
This is the philosophy
of oneness Advaita!
A meeting of all religions
is going to take place in Kashi,
you must attend the meet,
and take the first step towards your
victory lap of changing the society!
May victory be yours!
Our caste is superior!
Our religion is the only religion!
No, ours is the religion of people.
Our religion is the religion of world!
Our religion is the religion
of intelligentsia!
Do you say ours is
a religion of fools?
You fool!
- How dare you say like that!
Stop it! What's this ignorance?
What's this darkness?
How long will you fight in the
name of castes and religions?
You're just a boy!
How dare you argue in a religious
meet before scholars like me?
Who are you?
I'm God!
Are you God?
You're really crazy!
I'll bring him down!
If you're God, then you must
know everything, right?
Tell me, whether the insect under
my slipper will live or die!
Tell me!
It'll die!
It didn't die, did it?
Not at me, look there!
Now the frog will also die!
Can anyone tell what would
happen to the snake now?
I'll tell you! An eagle will
swoop down and take the snake!
Do you know what will happen next?
What else? Snake will die.
No, “won't die, W“ h“
around Shiv a' s neck.
Which Shiva?
- This Shiva!
If it doesn't happen as you say,
you're finished!
O snake, come!
If you've guts, dare fall on my neck!
Fall!
What's this?
Don't move, snake has fallen
around Shiva's neck.
Ask it to let go off me.
Tell it to leave me.
Say I'm Shiva, it'll leave.
I'm Shiva!
I'm Shiva!
Forgive me, my friends!
This is just magic to open your eyes.
Illusion is nothing but seeing
what really isn't there!
To get you out of such illusions,
I'm here to teach you the
philosophy of Oneness Advaita,
May you live a long life!
Greetings to Guru!
What have you studied?
Four Vedas, lo Upanishads, 80 Puranas!
Whatever I may have studied
I'm nothing but an anthill.
You know about yourself very well.
Indeed you're an anthill!
Look, how his face changed!
I repeated what he said!
He couldn't digest it.
If he can digest it,
that is philosophy of Advaita.
Move. . . move. . .
Saint is coming. . . move...
Go away!
Move. . . move. . . move away please!
Your disciples are asking me
to move away!
Don't you feel they're making a
mistake by asking me to move away?
It seems you're spreading
message that all are one!
One small question!
You're carrying a stick,
they're bowing in honour,
are they both same, sir?
Bad smell!
Another little dirty question.
You close your nose when you do penance
or for the bad smell of drinks,
is the gesture of closing
nose same for both?
Hey Swami! Lord Shiva is protector
of the worlds,
I'm caretaker of
burial ground in Kashi,
I say your Lord Shiva
and I are one and same!
What do you m'?
Hey low caste man!
Into these holy streets which are used
by scholars, sages and saints like me,
how dare you argue with me
after getting drunk!
Go away!
Just now I had sweet drink,
I'll tell you bitter truth!
I'm caretaker of burial ground,
people who told me to go away,
they've to come to me
in the last!
Will you go away or not?
Even the snake from Lord Shiva
didn't hiss at me,
how come you're hissing with anger?
Okay, I'll go away as you say!
I'll go further away!
I-low far I may go!
You're on the same earth
on which I'm!
Doesn't it defile you?
I'm under the sky,
you too are under the same sky,
doesn't it defile you?
The wind that touches this
low caste touches you too!
Is it okay to you?
You're taking bath in the same
river Ganges where I too take bath,
Is it not sin?
You say nothing is sin!
Forget all that!
Just tell me this,
you're asking to move away
this body of bones and skin,
or ever burning soul
which is inside this body?
Sage Vedavyasa!
How fortunate I'm!
This fortune belongs
to entire mankind.
I'm saying this swearing on
these holy scripts,
the world needn't fear for anything,
hut. . .
- Bu?
Lord Kasivishwanath along with
his consort Goddess Annapurneshwari.
Viveka Choodamani!
Sasthana Thrium!
Mother!
These holy texts reached the lap
of holy Ganges and to Lord Shiva.
Lord studied the texts many times.
He kept it on his head and
danced happily in trance.
Mother!
Have it!
My child!
This country is known as land
of Dharma and Karma, right?
Is it right to call it
like that simply?
Those words must come true, right?
Look there!
Karma protects and punishes!
Karma will devour you!
Even God can't save you from Karma.
That's it! You saw it, right?
There's nothing in your hand,
you can't do anything,
it's impossible for you,
with repeated sermons few people are
making humans insensitive and lazy!
Everything is in your hands!
If you decide you can do anything.
It seems you must take
this message to people.
My lord told me.
Good people are those fight
for good causes for people,
I'm telling you this,
Young men like you must clench your fists,
you must rebel,
bend such people and
bring them to our path,
First, give the taste of Advaita
philosophy to Mandana Mishra of Prayag.
Blow the bugle of victory march!
What's your Karma to go on
repeat the word karma!
Give me alms, please!
He)' ignorant!
How dare you enter my home
without my pennission!
Who are you?
The obsequies you're offering
to your ancestors,
I'm the form of all their souls!
I'm a soul of souls!
- Not my foot!
Go away as you came!
If not I'll have to throw you out!
This mendicant came as guest on
your father's death anniversary.
It's your duty to wash the
legs of guest and offer him food.
I'm not here for food!
To beg you for a debate.
Debate with me?
On my w a'; to here, your Gum
Kumara Neelabhat sad the same thing,
he lost the debate and
merged with Lord Shiva.
Whether you want to debate or
salute me, I'm leaving it on you.
I accept for the debate and
without a doubt say I'll be the winner.
You're twirling moustache
which you don't have,
you're imagining a victory
that will not be yours,
for me everything appears as one!
For this debate, I'm appointing my wife
Ubhaya Bharathi Devi as the judge.
I appreciate your gesture
of honouring women!
They say when husband is standing,
a wife mustn't sit.
I think my mother is sitting
to make you stand anyway!
He'll stand tall,
to say this I'm also standing.
Wow,
Such debates have rules
and regulations!
It's my duty to announce
rules as the judge.
While debating, never look up!
This is too much!
Don't use dirty words!
Don't make such hand gestures!
Don't say like that!
Don't laugh like that!
Don't stamp foot on ground.
How much ever the argument may be tough,
always debate with a smile.
I think both of you know this.
I know all this,
I did so that you'll know it.
Got it'.?
If my husband loses the debate,
if my husband loses,
he'll accept ascetic's life.
If Shankara loses.
He must give up ascetic's life,
marry and become a family man.
This is the challenge.
Hey young bachelor! You stand
to gain even if you lose,
you'll get a lovely wife!
These ﬂower garlands are magical,
the garland will wither
on the neck of the loser.
Victory to Mandana Mishra!
Isn't it like accepting defeat
and garlanding me?
Isn't it like taking
back steps in fear?
How can a greenhorn know
the power of a veteran!
Wow,
People call me a scholar
but you say I'm a greenhorn.
Scholar or greenhorn, all are one!
That's the philosophy of Advaita.
Always telling all are one,
what's this silly philosophy of oneness?
Scholars, at least you tell him.
Cry-laugh, anger-peace, fear-courage,
man-woman, nectar-poison!
How can it all become one?
Because everything was born from you!
Don't bite teeth in debate.
Don't sigh!
Don't stare!
Can you please explain how can
all can become one, young bachelor?
I'll not but make you accept it.
Observe it keenly.
This is Krishna,
this is Tungahhadra,
this is Ganga,
this is Yamuna,
this is Godavari,
this is Cauvery,
I filled this with water from all
the livers right before you,
now, separate the water of
different rivers in different vessels.
Are you playing fun with me?
How is it possible?
Fate!
With a smile!
Are you playing fun with me?
Fate!
How is it possible?
Impossible! Water from all the livers
have mixed to become one, right?
Likewise everything is one!
You're putting my mother
to great difficulty.
I mustn't bite my teeth and
make gesture like this!
Show you spread hand to everyone here.
Why is one very small and
big in different sizes?
Like your argument.
Hello, when your five fingers
are not equal,
how can everything be one?
Are you dazed?
Our proven philosophy of Karma
will not accept,
your illogical, meaningless
philosophy of oneness.
Got it'.?
But you will accept.
What did you offer to your
dead father yesterday?
'Pindam', food for dead!
What were you called as when you
were inside mother's womb?
'Pindam' (fetus)
What you offered for
dead father is 'Pindam'
what is inside mother's womb
is also 'Pindam',
that's okay, what were you called
as at your birth?
Don't you know that also?
With a smile!
Don't you know this also?
Infant!
When you grew up?
Boy!
Then, youth, old man!
When you die, you're known
as corpse, right?
This is unnecessary!
What's this unnecessary comment?
I'll make you accept necessary
and unnecessary are one!
Tell me what are you to your father?
- I'm his son!
What are you to your wife?
- Her husband!
If you've children?
What's this?
- Please answer me, sir.
I'll be father!
When your son gets married,
you get a daughter-in-law, right?
What are you to her?
- Father-in-law!
If she gives birth to a son?
Grandfather!
Isn't it surprising?
You were fetus, boy, son, husband,
father-in-law, grandfather,
and a corpse too!
When an ordinary fetus can
become so many,
creating this entire universe,
providing and protecting it,
that supreme power,
supreme God,
supreme soul,
why can't he be one?
Will you please tell me?
I got it.
I've realised everything is oneness!
Shankara, I...
- Please stop!
You haven't lost yet.
Only half of your garland
has withered.
I'm his better half?
He'll lose only after you
win over me too.
Do you agree to debate with me?
Mother you can start your debate.
You're a strict bachelor,
please listen to me carefully.
How many types of hugs are there?
How would the kiss of a maiden be?
How many types of romances are there?
What are they?
What is the motive of
union of man and woman?
Are these questions a mother
would ask her son, mother?
In debate, in gambling, in war,
as you say all are one!
There's no question of philosophy,
bonds, relationships.
Great!
I can answer your questions,
but I need little time to answer
it with experience.
As you wish!
Please get to know the answers
and come back.
You can go now.
King!
King, don't go on hunting
expedition today!
Planets are not favourable.
Is it?
But I don't believe in planets
and astrology.
Whether you believe or not,
please agree as royal priest says, Lord.
Don't go to hunt.
I'll go to hunt.
Even if you go, please don't go
to Nainisharanya forest.
I'll go to Nainisharanya forest only.
- Please try to understand, Lord.
You don't know what's in that forest.
- I know!
There are umpteen varieties of
trees and plants!
There are wild beasts!
I'll certainly go to that forest only.
I'll definitely hunt there.
I'll come back Victoriously.
We're going to Nainisharanya forest.
- Forest?
Yes, to Nainisharanya forest only.
A bachelor Sanyasi trying to learn
about love and sex...
No, it is not love and sex but
a holy union of creating new life.
I want to know and
I'll get to know.
Who are you?
You should be experiencing the pleasures
of a king with his concubines.
Why did you take to ascetic life
at this age?
X Pa“) You'.!
May you be blessed with long life!
No, I'll bless you!
May you experience all
the pleasures!
How can one get drunk and
come to hunt?
Don't know what would happen now?
Tiger! You're a tiger
and I'm a lion!
I'm a royal lion!
King! It's dangerous!
That's fun to me!
Whether it is beast or maiden,
I'll tame them with my hands.
Tiger!
Guru, the king we just met has
been killed by a tiger.
I got an answer to the question.
I'll enter the body of dead king.
I'll experience the holy union of
man and woman to create new life.
Guru! Why this extreme decision?
This will lead to many more doubts
and complications.
Think over it again.
This is not the time to think.
I'll leave my body now.
Keep my body safely in the cave.
Protect my body by applying herbs.
I'll come back after 45 days!
I know it is an illusion...
I know life is a puppet show...
I know it is a story...
I know every story will reach
its logical end...
Know this will end...
know this is bound to happen...
I know death is inevitable...
I know this body will disintegrate
in this mud...
Though you know everything,
why do you get yourself trapped into it?
Illusion!
Hail His Royal Highness King!
My dear citizens! I'm not your king
as you think,
I'm one amongst you,
to tell you the truth, you all are me,
you are me!
This kingdom belongs to people,
it is for people, by people!
People are the real kings!
Government isn't a system
to rule over people.
People are the rulers!
We're servants of people!
This is our king's real face!
King..O King!
People are facing severe poverty,
please advise us.
Tell them to drink and sleep like me.
I hate people.
Tell them, I don't want to see those
creeping and crying faces.
My sweet darling!
King, you must perform your
duties as king, right?
I'll perform my duties as king
for my queens only.
Hail Lord Shiva!
I can see visible change in king.
It's true I've changed but
it's not so visible.
I feel like I'm here as a student
to learn few lessons from you.
Observe it.
What do you want to learn?
How many types of hugs are there?
How would the kiss of maiden be?
What is the motive of
union of man and woman?
Will you teach me the science of union
to unravel the secret of procreation?
Hail Cupid!
Hail beautiful thoughts!
Hail the victorious world famous archer...
hail the majestic man!
Science of love is holy and pure...
First lesson is rule of embrace...
Embrace. . .
- Embrace...
Sensual delightful pleasure...
Union of bodies...
Delight to every part of body...
An invitation to pleasure
that follows...
A prologue to sensual love making...
Sensual touch!
Sensual arousal!
Caressing!
Stimulating!
Mother!
You're sick!
Why don't you avoid going
to river, mother?
If I don't there,
would the river come to me, son?
Mother! River Poorna!
What's this? River has come
to our door step!
I can't believe this!
If Rama kept his father's promise,
our Shankara keeps the promise
to his mother,
this is our Shankara's grace!
I'm sure this is done my son.
May God bless you, son!
You bombarded a young bachelor sanyasi with
questions on love, sex and romance.
He'll never come back here.
You're underestimating Shankaracharya.
I feel Shankara is Lord Shiva!
Stop it!
Stop your chant of hymns!
There's no God!
Why are you building temples for him?
Why are you offering prayers?
I feel like laughing at you.
Hey King, if you can prove
there is God,
I'll quit being atheist and start
praying God and fall at your feet.
If not you must fall at my feet!
What's this?
What are you doing?
What's this?
What happened;
It's burning me.
It won't burn you at all!
It's burning me and
you say it won't burn me.
Are you making fun of me?
You say it's burning without
anything spicy.
Moreover you say is it fun?
Why don't you please show me
that burning sensation?
How can I show it you?
One who gets burnt experiences himself.
It is not possible to show others.
Hail Lord Shiva!
When you can't show your
burning sensation!
He's manifestation of
everything on this world.
He's courage, spirit, consciousness,
conscience and supreme truth!
How can I show Him to you?
You can see a mirage
but it is not there.
Air is not seen but it is there!
You can see sky but it is not there.
Stars are there in day time also
but you can't see them.
You can't see smell
but can sense it.
What is seen under lens isn't
visible to normal eyes,
that doesn't mean it is not there.
Likewise God too can
only be experienced,
if you know this,
God whom you say isn't there
will accept he's there,
and God is nobody else
but yourself!
You'll realise it.
Hail beauty!
Hail lovely maiden!
Hail country beauty!
King! People. . . our people are
in dire straits.
They're throwing me into
dire straits.
King, we're organising special
prayers for the welfare of people.
It would be very good if you
attend along with your family, King.
Is it?
You carry on prayers there,
I'll carry on with my prayers here.
Everything is fine hut what brought
a dramatic change in our king?
King going out at nights!
Is it?
I got it!
He has entered this king's body!
I'll put the dice and
move my pawn.
I'll take over the holy
Kashmir Sarvagna Peetam.
I know Veda...
I know the lamp of Vedic philosophy...
I know science...
I know who is permanent
and who is not here...
I know this is a bag of water...
I know this is a bag of air...
I know this bubble would
burst one day...
I know what is up above would
vanish into thin air...
Though you know everything, why do you
get yourself dirtied in the slush?
Illusion!
It's proved that some other man has
entered the body of our king.
King!
For the welfare of our people,
I'm taking a hard decision.
Kingdom is prospering,
people are seeing golden rule of Rama,
if this king has to be
like this openly,
if this rule has to carry on
like this only,
tell me what should we do?
The man who entered King's body
would've left his body,
the body would be somewhere.
We must find the body.
We must cremate it.
Then, our king will remain
as our king for life.
I too want that to happen.
Minister, cremate anybody
you find in this kingdom.
Father...father...father...
He took two wives like me.
But still he died.
He was wearing so many jewels,
his wives took away everything.
At least conduct his funeral rites.
He made more jewels for his
second wife, right?
Let her conduct it.
Why should I do it? He made a gold
coin chain for you, right?
You conduct it.
He gave the house in
Jangala street, right?
You cremate him.
You took the fan-Inland
in Lingalapuram, right?
You cremate him.
- You cremate him.
Stop it!
We're here to cremate the body.
Pick the body!
How long will you exercise?
Finish it quickly.
This is the last exercise.
Corpse exercise.
He says corpse and exercise.
Pick the corpse!
He's not a corpse,
he's exercising.
That's a corpse exercise.
Exercise for a corpse,
my dear mad aunty!
Your husband is dead.
Hubby! Are you dead?
God! Is my husband really...
how nice it would be if he's dead!
How nice it is!
They say corpse exercise would
make you ﬂy in air.
I'm really feeling like
ﬂying in air.
Hey, he's still alive!
I'm dead!
It seems he's dead, pick him up.
What's this body?
This is not a body, he's our Guru.
- Guru?
Why is lying like that?
Not lying but doing exercise.
Oh that! I got it.
This is corpse exercise, right?
Do you know about those exercises too?
Hey, better we know we know everything.
Come on, let's go.
They think we're ignorant
about exercises.
They'll find Shankara's body
and cremate it.
I'll become the head of Sarvagna Peetam.
He's finished!
Yes, I think you're finished.
Look there, soldiers are
coming empty handed.
What happened soldiers?
Where's the corpse?
That's not a corpse but a man
doing corpse exercise.
You brought us unnecessarily
to forest.
Ignorant! Those scholars
cheated you easily.
That's a body without life,
a lamp without oil!
Earth is gone...
It is devastated...
It's gone...everyone knows...
O mind, there's something
which is still unknown...
Though many said they know...
It's not yet decided whether
it's there or not...
It seems we must close both eyes
and open the third eye...
Sky, earth, mountain, valley...
it seems everything must appear as one...
It seems we must know the players
and the director are one...
One you realise this truth...
The illusion will vanish!
Mother, my education is over.
Please bless me.
Please tell me one thing.
Who are you in my hush and' s body'.?
King will remain with you
as half of your body.
Hereafter rule the kingdom yourselves.
Hail Lord Shiva!
Mother!
Hereafter Mandana Mishra will
achieve fame as Sureshwarulu.
We're blessed.
Let's awaken the nation that has
fallen into despair!
Blow the conch of revolution
to start our victory march!

Hail Lord Venakteshwara of seven hills!
I installed Srichakram in
Lord Venkateshwards temple,
the box here will receive donation
in gold, silver and money in plenty.
Your brightness shows you've
the blessings of Goddess of wealth.
Why don't you pray to mother?
She'll rain you with gold.
You can happily go around in
chariots and palanquins.
Why do you want to trouble yourself?
Ascetics don't need comforts and pomp.
God bless you long...
I'm blessed my son...I'm blessed.
You never left me alone.
I see only you in everyone I meet.
Son, I heard you did so much
for this world,
will you do just one thing
for your mother?
Tell me, mother.
When I'm still alive,
I want to see the plays of
Lord Krishna and die happily, son.
As you wish, mother.
Lord Krishna of Dwaraka...
With the witness of millions souls
who took refuge in you...
You're omnipotent, omnipresent
and in breathe...
You're the protector of
five basic elements...
Show your plays as song and dance
that moves and shakes the world...
Show it to mother...
Plays are many not just one or two...
What am I to show?
I'll tell you hut you must show it
right now here to mother, okay?
Would people like you take
a no easily?
I'm always at your command!
When mother asked on hearing
you ate mud as you eat butter...
You got caught to your mother
and for her love and devotion...
You opened your mouth to show
the 14 worlds to your mother...
Show that to mother...
You stole saris of young Gopikas and
told them to pray lifting their hands...
You honoured friendship hut eating
puffed rice and blessing with riches...
With 16000 Gopikas
and 8 young wives...
You romanced and loved
but remained a bachelor...
It seems as a symbol of this,
you sported peacock feather on crown...
To mesmerize this world,
it seems you play ﬂute...
You showed your gigantic form
as Parthasarathy...
You imparted philosophy
in your every ploy...
Show it to mother...
Bless her with eternal bliss...
Let me see mother!
You blessed mother with liberation,
give liberation body of mother.
Shankara is a sanyasi, how can he
conduct funeral rites of his mother?
If he does it, this place will turn
into a cremation ground.
They don't know that you
don't know anything.
You keep quiet.
This is an issue of men.
Keep quiet! Are you a man?
If not what else,
he learnt lo languages as a kid,
to save people from ﬂoods,
he impounded river Narmada in a jug.
He made river Poorna to ﬂow
near house for his mother.
Don't think such a great scholar
wouldn't know this small thing?
If you go against scripts,
the place will turn into a desert.
Yes, though Shankaracharya is Guru to
the world, he's a defiled man for us.
Nobody must go to carry
the body or even to see it.
This is my order.
God, I beg for fire.
My mother has died.
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms.
My mother is dead.
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms, mother!
Are you giving him fire?
Come inside!
Son'
Mother, my mother is dead.
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms, mother!
You're a sanyasi,
mother of a sanyasi!
Is she mother or anything else...
Get lost, man!
Acharya! Alms please!
Order me what do you want?
I want you to sacrifice your life.
You want yourself, so be it.
Withdraw your charm!
Sir, you please carry on.
I took this extreme step in the desire
to head Sarvagna Peetam of Kashmir.
You're the world Guru who
deserves to head that Peetam.
Go to Kashmir by next
full moon day of Karthik month,
you must head that seat.
Hail Lord Shiva!
My dear people of this congregation!
This is the holy seat of
Kashmir Sarvagna Sharada Peetam.
The man who wins over the scholars
present here with his arguments,
he can sit on that throne.
You can carry on with your debate.
What? What?
Debates?
Look at him once!
You know who he is, right?
Aadi Shankaracharya!
Walking from Kanyakumari
to Kashmir 4 times,
Otaking on and shredding elders,
scholars of all religions, castes,
and established the philosophy of
oneness of Advaita throughout the country,
he's the lion of spiritual philosophy.
That throne belongs to him!
Indeed!
Aadi Shankara is that worthy scholar,
I didn't say that but great Vedic
scholar Bhaskara said so,
great philosopher Neelakanta said so,
great scholar of Dharma
Prabhakar said so,
great debater Mandana Mishra,
another great scholar
Abhinavamuktha said so,
scholars of every sect in India fell
at his feet and sought his refuge,
is there anyone better choice than
him in this august assembly?
There's no one!
Knowing well there's no one,
if by mistake if anyone
wants to stand up,
I'm asking them to think over
it again for a moment,
I know Shankara from the
day he was born,
in fact I know him before
he was born,
he did great penance from childhood to drive
away ignorance and meanness from society,
'Aparanochabhuti, 'Atmabodha',
'Anandalahari, ' Brahmasutrabhashyam',
'Panchikarana Prakfiya',
'Upadesa Sahasri', 'Brahmageetha',
with more than 200 such books,
he gave to the world a new philosophy
of oneness known as Advaita.
This great philosopher.
People who know this know there's
no better choice than Shankara,
I know they too know this.
You got it, right?
Shankara was born with a reason and
he's the only one qualified to sit on it.
No!
Shankara who accepted the holy
pious life of a sanyasi twice,
I've seen him conduct his mother's
funeral as an ordinary man,
he broke the rules of
pious life of sanyasi,
he's not qualified to sit
on that throne.
Hey Kapalika!
No use in shouting aimlessly!
A sanyasi means giving up
worldly comforts and pleasures.
Not humanity!
You accuse of seeing Shankara
conducting his mother's funeral, right?
First let's decide what a sanyasi
should do and what not!
Can a sanyasi bow to his father or not?
- No!
Ever since I became a sanyasi,
my father bows to me.
A sanyasi must never bow to anyone
not only to his parents.
Skandapuranam, Kasikandam part,
Visweshwara Smruthi 11 chapter, 50th hymn,
It means a sanyasi must bow
to his mother as a rule!
That's the meaning of the hymn.
You understood it, right?
One can snap the umbilical cord
between mother and child,
not even ascetic life can snap
the bond of mother and child...
This is not philosophy but edict!
Well said!
In just 32 years of age,
never before anyone did this,
you've achieved great things,
you showed to the world that age
of saints isn't a criterion,
as youth, you raised the ﬂag high,
you're the wisest scholar!
Though he controls Goddess of wealth,
he never asked her a penny for his own,
this selﬂess, humble Yogi is only
one qualified to sit on that throne.
I know this! I wanted everyone
to know this,
to see Shankara sitting on
the prestigious Peetam,
I played this drama.
I'm announcing Shankaracharya
as Jagadguru!
Hail Jagadguru Aadi Shankaracharya!
Stop!
Mother! Goddess Sharada!
I bow to your hand that gives
knowledge to this world.
To touch this seat, one must have
a clean soul as well as clean body.
Though a sanyasi, you entered the
body of another man,
you studied romance and love,
how will you justify his?
This incident which may astonish
the future generations,
I want your answer.
What's the meaning of your silence?
There is, mother! It has meaning
and substance too.
Eons ago Matsyendra entered
the body of a king,
and saved a kingdom,
scholars said it was according to dharma
and to save the kingdom he did so.
Lord Krishna, who loved 16008
Gopikas and wives,
we still accept him as strict bachelor,
I too entered another man's
body on the same lines,
to show to the world
how the rulers must behave,
adhering to the strict rules
of Katopanishad,
with the usage of Vajroliya system,
for the welfare of this world
and it's people,
the drama I played will never
break my vow of celibacy!
If my words are lies,
it they're false,
even it there's slightest
of sin in it,
in the witness of
sacred monosyllable,
may my head break into 1000 pieces!
Do you want to sacrifice few more
years of your life to Shankara?
No, my life will end today and
Shankara's life will end tomorrow.
I'm a great man!
I'm the only great man!
Everyone think so!
Why;
Because that is true!
Who thinks like that?
Inner soul!
Who is greater than inner soul?
This is absolute truth!
A truth that only sages and
saints of India know!
With my 32 years of life I too
realised an absolute truth,
life is nothing a fight with ignorance,
inequality, inhumane behaviour.
There's nothing to lose
in dying while fighting.
Except the shackles of ignorance!
No use is fighting,
fight with tooth and nail!
Never underestimate the
power of youth!
They're centres of power!
Flow of consciousness!
Love is the supreme knowledge
which only they know it.
Love is the only language
which entire world understands.
Love! Love as you love yourselves!
Love every living creature
of this world!
This is the dharma of Hindu!
This is orthodox Hindu custom!
This is tradition!
Love is the only mantra that can bring
together people, nations, and planets!
Know the man next to you is God!
There won't be any jealousy then!
There won't he anything
to steal and hoard!
No more boundaries!
No more wars!
No more bloodshed!
No more religions!
Peace. . . only peace will exist!
Only peace will be there!
I'm leaving the four seats of
knowledge in your hands.
Protect it!
Nectar! Drink it!
Death will never come near you!
Are you asking me to drink nectar for this
body which will get reduced to ashes?
Or for the ever burning soul?
Hail Lord Shiva!
Lord Shiva is omnipresent
and omnipotent!
