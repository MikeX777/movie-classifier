Go, go, go wash up l am coming.

You are getting annoyed sir.
No, what's there to get annoyed.

Why this cheap haggling?
Now please let me go, this is enough.
My son has come only for a day,
so please. Goodbye.
Please leave.
Since how long has
this been going on?
Since 4 years.
And all this while you
never got the time to tell me.
What are you thinking now?
What will you tell him?

And if your father doesn't agree?
Then l will have to listen to him.
Seriously.
Sia, Sia, look at me.

And l can fight not just my
father but the entire world, for you.

your father's money!
Don't forget that!
The food is served.

Why didn't you wake me up?
He didn't even tell me.
When l woke up in the
morning he was gone..

Why will l lie?
Because you only have pampered him!

conspiracy, don't l understand!

How are you my son?
Why have you kidnapped me?
Kidnap? Who told you
that l got you kidnapped?

..your father wouldn't
have allowed otherwise..
He acts like a lord,
now he will know.
Look, if you have any
enmity with my father..
..then settle it with him,
why are you dragging me in-between?
My l.A.S. results

No son, l don't have any
enmity with your father..
..Mr. Madhukar.
But he should realise that
other people have self respect too.
Now he will know.
Anyway.. now you take rest.
But let me go, why are
you holding me captive.
Why? Didn't you tell him till now?
Where is it?
This Lalatua will

Look boy, on the
13th is your marriage.
What nonsense is this?
Oh.. English !

be licking Mr. Jagdish's ass!
Son, the girl is beautiful, cultured,
she cooks well, respects her elders..
..what more do you want, tell me?
This is crazy!
Where are you going,

Shall l say something?
Why, want to buy something or what?
The way you are getting
Janki married, is that right?

Ask your father.
Singh sir, we enjoyed a lot.
great food, great drinks,
and what a dance.
My youth is of no use
without you, my darling.
l have never seen such a dance.
We had paid 11,000 rupees.
That's fine, but how
much did you splurge on her.
Lawyer sir splurged 50,000 on her.
Come, come Mr. Sharma.
We all were remembering you...
...so l thought that
l should call you.
Sit down please.
Jagarnath! Get the fish.
Just a minute.
l didn't understand
one thing Singh sir...
When you have so much money?
why did you kidnap the boy?
But Singh sir saved all of his money.
What is money and wealth?
lt is transient.
lt comes, it goes.
For me, the biggest thing is honour.
Sometimes, for your honour...
...you have to put your life on risk.
Great Mahender sir, great.
For your honour.
You risked your daughter's life.
No one's life is at risk,
both are living together...
everything will be fine

When are you
introducing us to brother-in-law?
l want to meet him too.
Can we meet him today?
No dear.
Please sit down.
lt will take sometime to meet him.
Dear, the thing is that...
...the priest has
restricted anyone to meet son-in-law
...for the next 15 days.
Because the auspicious
occasion has not come.
You know that son-in-law is
still living in the outhouse.
He has not even been

when you come.

But will surely meet him.

Don't say please to me.
Look, l have a girlfriend in Delhi.
You do understand girlfriend,
don't you?
l mean, for the past 4 years
we have been staying together.
And... she is pregnant.
And l don't even know
what condition she is in...
And even she doesn't know
what l have gotten into.
Why should l ruin
your life purposely.
Look, you are a nice girl,

...that's why l am telling you.
Oh God!
How is it?
- Good, sir.
Buy 5 kilos of it.
Come, come inspector sir.

He has approached the DG Police.

The matter has become serious now.

The police are
looking for son-in-law.
So now?
- So what?
He was asking if
everything is settled with them.
How long will it take?
How would l know?
l cannot ask Janki about this?
Ask her.
Why can't you ask her,
you are her mother?
So what if l am her mother,
how can l ask her that?
Don't give me a lecture.
Explain to her, that
she is married now...
...they are husband and wife.
Then why is it taking so long.
Look, the marriage has to be
consummated... as soon as possible.
Understood.
Tell me what is it?
Won't you tell me?
Dear.
lt is not something to
think about so much.
...will you say something?
Have you gone mad?
What is wrong with this?
Let them go out? So
that he can run away!
Will your men do nothing?
Send them along.
Look... don't you want...
...your sister's life to get settled?
Everything becomes fine between them.
Tell me.
Okay.
What is the name of your girlfriend?
Sia.
- Really.

What's wrong?
Dear.
Just a minute, listen.
Listen to me.

Look here, look at me.
Don't say that,
Look, everything

Don't say no to her, or else

He is feeling shy.
Don't you like girls?
What kind of a man are you?
You have been living with a girl
in the room for so many days...
...don't you feel
like doing anything.
l don't think he is capable!
Sir, all this useless talk.
Ask him for what we have called him.
He is intelligent himself,
he lives in Delhi.
You are not doing your duty,
the duty of a husband.
Tell us if you have any problem.
lt can be treated then...
Did you understand?
Tonight if you don't do

You think l am impotent!

for this day for so long.
Why are you nervous now?
Who knows what
son-in-law will like to eat?
Mother, we have
prepared so many things...
...he will surely like something.
You go and change, l
will get all done here.
Okay.
You fool! He ran away!
Who is it?
Mr. Mahender, so late in the night?
Son-in-law ran away.
- How?
Think of something and catch him...
...if not, then file a case
against him, but bring him back!
Mr. Mahender, it is not so
easy as you think it is...
...his father knows
the police general.
So you can't do anything.
Look l have always supported you...
...l supported you in this also.
But Mr. Mahender,
don't feel offensive but...
lt has been so many days...
...your daughter
should have done something.
Look, l will try.
Who knows how far he
must have gone in the night.
Ramlakhan, take the jeep out.
And you actually expect me to
believe this bizarre story of yours.
Sia, you still doubt me!
You can't imagine... - Can you
imagine what has happened...
...with me here?
Mom is a heart patient, you know!
Anyways, what
difference does it make to you!
You are already married
And l am about to get married.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Why are you doing this to me Sia?
Rags please, please
don't say anything more.
my parents have gone through hell...
...l don't think l will be able to
forgive myself for doing this to them.
But the least l can do is...
not hurt them anymore.
And l don't think my dad
will be happy to see you here.
Tell me one thing, has the
marriage been consummated?
Then there is no problem.
We have already lodged a case
of 498A and dowry prohibition.
Now we will file a case for
restitution of conjugal rights.
Then we will see how
your son-in-law escapes.
Greetings Mr. Mahender.
l heard that your
son-in-law ran away.
lt was very sad to hear that.
And what were those bouncers doing?
What will you do now, have
you thought of anything?
lf you need my help...
Just get these two
medicines that's all.
Greetings Mr. Mahender.
Congratulations! You are going to be
a grandfather. Distribute sweets now.
Okay, l will leave.
- Fine.
There is so much
tension in this house...
...and you are drinking.
There is no tension.
l have thought of everything.
Janki will go to her
in-law's house tomorrow.
Do you know what you
are talking about?
Speak softly.
Look, you know that...
The doctor has said, Janki
needs at least 3 months...
Just do what l tell you to do...
Go, and send Janki here.
Go!
Where are all of them?
Where are my specs... Bechen?
Who knows where he kept it?
Hello...
Hello...
- Hello.
Hello...
- Hello
Who is it, Veer!
Where are you son?
How are you?
We were searching for you...
l had a feeling it will be
that scoundrel's work only.
Where is mother?
She has gone to Deoghar
yesterday to pray for you...
...and look, you called today.
Veer listen to me carefully son.
Leave the hostel today,
and shift with Sandeep.
You had been selected in
the mains, do you know.
That's it, stay with
Sandeep and prepare harder...
...next year you
have to become an l.A.S!
And tomorrow when
your mother comes...
l'll call you up.
Take care, bless you.
Are you feeling okay?
What do you think, all
this happening is fine?
What difference will it make
if Janki goes after a few days?
ln this condition? who knows
what kind of people they are...
...how the place will be.
Why don't you say something?
What's up? What's taking so long?
Mr. Jagdish is in a hurry,
quickly send the tea.
Let it be, Mr. Sahi, l have
to go to the cold storage...
...some other time.
No, no, no sir sit, it
will come right now.
Send some tea.
Did you find out anything?
- No. - Don't worry.
One minute! One minute!
Congratulations Mr.
Sahi, sweeten your mouth.
What's the occasion?
You are about to become a
grandfather, and me too.
Did you hear Mr. Jagdish?
Have you all come here drunk?
My son is not even married,
then how can l become a grandpa?
Ram, Ram, Ram, such
inauspicious words.
The entire village knows...
...that my daughter is
married to your son.
Dear, touch his feet.
Hey, stop it, stop it! There's no
need for this drama. l don't know her.
l have not opened a
charity-home for you.
Move on, move on.
What you are doing is wrong,
brother-in-law.
l am doing the wrong thing?
...and what you have done
being the uncle... was right?
Don't push me brother-in-law,
what had to happen...
...has happened. Take a
look at the wedding photo.
l have seen many such fake photos.
Look Mr. Sahi, l have been
talking to you with respect...
And you are?
- l am crossing the limit? Eh?
My son has been kidnapped.
l have lodged an FlR with the police.
Mr. Jagdish is the witness.
The police are on their way.
All of you get out of here, or
else you will be behind bars!
Mr. Sahi, it is against
the pride of our village!
l don't do such buffoonery like you.
You people are into this racket.
Hey shut your mouth! Shut up!
Brother-in-law, what had
to happen has happened.
This is your blood.
How would l know whose blood it is?
How would l know where
all she has been to?
Who all she has slept with?
Mr. Sahi!!
Don't shout!
l will file a case against you.
- Go and file it!
l will not let the
judgement pass. ls this a joke!
Don't brag about yourself.
l will brag about myself.
You know the entire
village is the witness.
l will see you! Bloody uncouth,
barbarian, rascal!
Now...
Seems like, maybe l
made some mistake.
Maybe?
l was telling you
from the beginning...
...that all this is wrong.
Quiet! just be quiet!
l will get Janki married again,
with someone else.
Far away.
Have you gone mad?
She is pregnant.
How long does it
take to abort the child?
Great, you have said a
very wonderful thing today.
lf you have the courage, go
and tell your daughter too.
Because l can't even think
of such a disgusting thing.
Dear, dear.
Sit, sit.
Sometimes a man
thinks of something...
...and something else happens.
No one can go against
the will of the Lord.
We will go to Patna in a day or two.
We will meet a good doctor.
Everything will be fine.
This boy was not right.
doesn't matter.
l will look for another boy.
This time nothing will go wrong.
Come, we will have
breakfast together. Come on.

not thought about it.
What is the problem here?
- YOU!
What are you doing?
Quiet! Tell her
that she has gone mad!
What are you doing?
You keep quiet! Tell her!
Whatever l am doing,
it is for her good...
...she doesn't understand!

done everything for my good!
But you have done enough
good for me!
Now no more.
- Janki, you...
The life that's budding in me...
...l will not tolerate
anyone who thinks ill of him!
Dear, you... in this condition...
alone.
Nothing will happen to me mother.
You won't go anywhere?

Without my permission, you
cannot step out of this house!
