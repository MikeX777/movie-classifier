You have been Iike

Thank you
Excuse me
Reporters want to take her picture

Ok, Do it
I'm so sorry
Mr. Ken You, too
Stay here forjust in case
Just in case?
After 1 7 movies together
this is the Iast one with Mr Mihara
I reaIIy feeI sad
It's been great to working with him
How about you
Mr. Mihara?
We've been working together
for a Iong time
I feeI sad, too
There was another movie Iining
for you two?
Yes, but because of me,
It's not gonna happen
I'm sorry
Are George and Mary gonna be
the next hero and heroine?
Mary couId be too young
for Mr. Mihara's counterpart
-Mr Mihara?
-Yes?
Mary as your counterpart
Oh, yes, yes
She is
I've been toId you gave up
the main roIe for George, though
There wiII be an
officiaI announcement Iater
-What is it?
-I have no idea I'II go check right away
The bus headed for the Iocation
is ready to Ieave
Hey, Ken
What's up?
News Flash
Director: Saito Tacehichi
Shoot the lead
TeII me what you know
They wiII kiII me if I do
Because of you...
It's to predictabIe
A lone wolf
Going against the gang
The sea calls the man
The man who believes in hope
Director: Yoshikawa takumi
The sea hawk
What's up?
Aren't you in the middIe
of shooting?
Modify the script for
''Wondering Dog''
and more cIose-ups
of Tetsu in ''Sea Hawk'', right?
-OK we'II keep it that way
-Good Job
What's going on?
CaIm down
Let's have a taIk
about next movie
I Iost my part in
''The Fang of Snowy Mountain''?
I was going to teII you that...
I can certainIy work
with a young actress
But, Mihara
You couId get me
another actress
if Mary is too young for me
There are pIenty out there
It's aII about how the audience thinks to them,
you are Keiko's counterpart Isn't he?
That's why the next movie is
so important to me!
But
Don't teII me you don't know
our recent box office record
-Are you bIaming me?
-I mean, the whoIe movie industry is going down
You saw ImperiaI Wedding
and Iast year's OIympics on TV
TV is rapidIy growing up
We must find a way
to get through this
-That
-That's why
We need new faces
We must be proactive
If not, we can't survive
It's inevitabIe
Way more serious than you think
I guess I have no choice
I quit, contract is about to be
expired anyway
But that's
I'm getting many proposaIs
And some independent
projects, too
I don't need to stay on
a sinking ship
CaIm down
The situation is the same
everywhere
You shouId think it over
Don't you think, Ms Shino?
If you are Ieaving, fine
I'm not kissing some
Big shot's ass anymore
But, If you are staying
we got pIans for you
I have a pIane
ReaIIy, what kind of pIans?
We'II make George Iook good
starting from next movie
There's even a murder scene at the end
We aIso have a pIan for sequeIs
How?
You said he gets murdered
He wiII come to Iife again, every time
He couId be a twin brother or a Iook-a-Iike, a robot
Oh! HeII no!
I'm not taking that kind of crap!
You know
Know what?
Keiko is retiring
Decision is from the main office
PIease understand
Or, maybe you can make her
change her mind?
Then the main office
wiII reconsider
You are here because
of Keiko anyway
Congratulations
Keiko be happy
The end of Love
Yes, more to the right
more, more
Yes, yes OK
OK Here we go
Ready?
Good, good
ReIax, reIax yourseIf
Ready?
Here we go
OK
FabuIous
We're ready to roII
Thank you
-Thank you so much
-Thank you
I'm sorry about your next movie
It's not your fauIt
-There wiII be
-I'm not coming to your fareweII party
I thought so
You don't have to quit
because you got married
There is no guarantee
for good parts in the future
AIso, I don't want to go into TV
That is so practicaI
An acting career is
a career of criticism and
I am tired of criticism
Don't push yourseIf too hard, too
-Keiko! Come here!
-I'II be right over, I gotta go
Good-bye
I am sure
I'II do fine even without you

Congratulations Keiko
The end of Love
Opened on October 12th, 1965
The Big Star Keiko's
finaI masterpiece
The End of Love
I didn't see it...
Hundreds of movies came out
every year those days
Most of them were hardIy
known to the pubIic,
but they were aII good
It's not easy to watch oId movies
in a theater
or on video these days
That's true
I used to work here as
a recording engineer
It was exciting back then
The studio was fuII of peopIe
Iights were on nights and days
I worked Iike crazy everyday
But I reaIIy miss then
Oh, my
-Mihara, is it reaIIy you?
-Yes
There was a huge Iayoff
when I was 40
They toId me to be a freeIancer
In other word, I got fired
There was a sharp faII
in production
Right, I was forced to take
an ordinary job
It wasn't easy
FiIm was aII I knew
I swore not to come back
but eventuaIIy I came back
Swore not to come back
What do you think it is?
I've aIways wanted to
come back... Why?
- What is it?
- Nothing
Oh, the waiting room
during the oId days
-Did you use it, too?
-Yes
It's a warehouse now
The fIoor is aII rotten and ruined
Is that so
What can you do? They are TV
peopIe, and that's their attitude...
Oh, and the director
he got his hair impIanted
It's aIright
I quit
Quit what?
- Work
- Why?
Because it's useIess
Come on, you were just
unIucky this time
What an asshoIe
He succeeded in TV
He doesn't know
shit about movies
Just kissing the
TV producer's ass
But stiII he is a director
even with impIanted hair
Supporting a director to
compIete a movie
no matter what
That's ourjob
-Some job you have there
-Listen
I know work is hard
the paycheck isn't stabIe
and you are busy as heII
But you are doing great
Let's taIk about it tonight
I can stay over your house
What the heII are you
taIking about?
- Why you
- Get out!
- What the
- Get out
Someone there?
Sorry, sorry
What are you doing there?
I didn't mean to
I was remembering oId days
and my feet Ied me here
I used to date here
behind peopIe's eyes
It was nothing Iike that
Besides, you shouId be
in the waiting room
Sit down here, pIease
Here we go
SmiIe, pIease
Make it a soft smiIe
- Make me Iaugh
- Excuse me?
It's been awhiIe
I mean I wasn't the good at smiIing
naturaIIy back then, either
The guard showed me
your oId photo
You were a chiId actor
There was a studio
near my house
I was accidentaIIy picked up
You got picked up?
CooI!
It wasn't that great
One day, a director asked me
You, aren't you hungry?'
Come to think of it now
any kid who couId eat vigorousIy
was fine to him
I was perfect because
my famiIy was so poor
I wore a costume, a wig
and make-up
After one Iine
aII I had to do was eat
During the shoot I had a bowI of rice
Whenever mother roIe actress
made a mistake
I got a whoIe new bowI of rice
It was heaven
As Iong as that woman had
kept making mistakes
I'd eat as much as I couId
I thought I reaIIy stuffed myseIf
Then I thought, an acting
career was good
Movies were good
There are onIy a few reaI actors
The rest works just for food
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?
About quitting yourjob?
You heard it
I'm sorry
Are you serious?
Yes, I am
ReaIIy
I Iove movies
That's why I'm here, but
But?
Um...
You once quit acting
didn't you?
It was for because of my ego
Everyone Ieft me
EventuaIIy I Iost everything
It's been 35 years
Since the Iast time
I was here and in a movie
I reaIIy want to be in a movie
one more time
Even in a movie Iike this?
Like this?
You know, cheap and cheesy
That's what the audience decides
Right now, I pIay an oId man
That's it
Did you get it?
A smiIing face
Yes, thank you very much
