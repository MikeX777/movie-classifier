[PANTING]
We need to sweat them more.
We need to sweat.
Without sweat,
everything's nothing.
This fight, if you sweat,
the fight's gonna be
much easier for you.
Now, you don't work
hard enough.
It's all about pain.
How to receive pain
and give it out.
That's our gym.
That's all we do.
That's all we do.
Just always make sure
that you come to the gym,
always is pain.
You got pain, you give back.
That's always it.
That's the story usually.
Ole G's raised me,
that package blow.
Living life.
Living life in sin,
seein' wasn't in the...
[MAN] Alonzo.
Yo.
I have been waitin'
on this day.
I ain't gotta have 'em
that tight.
It ain't like
I ain't goin' home.
Alonzo.
Son, could I hold your hand?
Father, I pray right now
for Alonzo
as he leaves this place, God.
Lord, bless him and his family.
God, we ask, God,
that you'd restore everything
that the enemy
has stolen from him.
Bring it back, my lord!
And we'll give you praise,
in Jesus' name, amen.
Amen.
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.
You're a changed man, Alonzo.
I believe God's gonna
tremendously use you.
Thank you.
Yes.
A'ight, ole G.
All right, now.
What's up, man?
I'm gonna remember everything
you taught me.
Keep your head up in here, man.
I'm gonna miss you, brother.
Gonna miss you, too, man.
I'm gonna write you, though,
shoot you a couple kites.
Lonzo!
Let's roll, man.
I'm good, man.
I'm good, man.
You know Donte
ain't gonna like this.
Is what it is, man.
I'm good on Donte.
Why haven't you left yet?
You get a job yet?
Hey!
What?
What.
Look, God first,
school second,
because you are not losing
that scholarship,
and then dancing third.
And you don't have to worry
about a job.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Excuse me?
Anyway, I appreciate you, sis.
All right.
I'll talk with you later, okay?
All right.
Okay.
Oh, I'll be at church
later tonight,
if you're looking for me.
Yo, Alonzo, Mike,
another one
of our tenants here.
What's going on, man?
What's up, Mike?
Well, this is your place.
Not the best.
A lot better than the joint.
The other tenant left
a few things here.
You don't wanna keep 'em,
throw 'em out.
Okay.
Uh, need to tell you this.
We're here for ya,
but we do have rules.
No drugs, no drinkin',
no yellin', no fighting,
and I know
you just out the joint,
but absolutely no women.
I can respect that.
All right. All right.
Now, if you forget it,
here's the rules,
right here on the door.
We only have one shower,
but there's a boxing gym
down the alley.
Got a lotta showers.
The owner'll let you use it.
Welcome.
All right. Thanks.
Make yourself comfortable.
Appreciate it.
 [HUMMING]
You can do this.
You can do this, Mia.
[LAUGHS]
 [HUMMING]
I gotta pee.
We'll just have to stop
somewhere.
I don't understand
why her mom is so strict.
If I was 20 and I couldn't have
my own friends
in my house, I would...
just let it go.
Go cr... what do you mean let...
like that's weird.
It is weird.
We'll just have to stop somewhere.
It... but... I mean should we
talk to her about this?
Ready?
Can I run in and use your bathroom?
No, let's just go to Harold's.
I want a bite to eat anyway.
Okay?
[LAUGHING]
[TIANNA]
Hey, look at this dude.
[NICOLE]
He was something.
[TIANNA]
I don't know why.
Where's our boy?
Hi, this is your dad.
Call me back.
I tried to call you,
but nobody's picking up phone.
Please you call me back.
Very, very important.
Hey, look at them shorties
right here.
Hey, yo, shorties!
You with the light eyes.
What's your name?
I ain't seen you
around here before.
[GIGGLING]
Hey!
Hey!
You hear me talkin' to you?
What's so funny?
I didn't get the joke.
Why don't you fill me in?
Mia! Let's go!
I got your attention now, huh?
Bye, Mia.
Yo, Bobby, I like her.
[BALLET INSTRUCTOR] Press the
shoulders down and make sure you...
Hands up, right, right, right.
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
The muscles,
use them for balancing.
Okay.
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[MIA] Wow.
[NICOLE] I know. It's kinda
drab in the daytime.
You would never think
it was like a hot club.
Ooh, you ready for this, Mia?
Uh, sure.
[MAN] What's wrong with you?
You-you really wanna fight?
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, we're here to sign up.
To train?
No, to sing.
Oh! I got you.
You mean tonight at the underground.
Yes.
Sweetheart,
you ain't got to sign up.
Just show up, bring your music,
and work it out
with the deejay.
That's it?
That's it.
It's fast,
especially tryin' make it
to the stage,
what, after that kid
made it big here.
Just get up there quick,
cue your music, and let it rip!
All right?
Don't be shy about it.
Oh, you ain't got to worry
about us.
We ain't shy.
[CHUCKLES]
All right, well, look,
I gotta get back to work,
so good luck, all right?
All right, thanks so much, man.
Come on.
[NICOLE] Yeah, thanks.
Take care.
All right.
Damn.
All right!
Hey, ma.
Can I come in?
You know, that boy of yours
has learned to walk and talk
since he last seen you.
Smart, too.
Alonzo, I asked you not to
hang out with those thugs,
and you didn't listen!
Ma, it's different now.
Look, don't patronize me!
Your father died out there
for that same street garbage.
He was nothing.
And you?
You wanna do this to me
all over again.
And to these children.
I'm not him!
And I ain't nothing.
You know that.
Well, then show me, Alonzo!
Because this,
this is not my son.
Eat your food.
[MAN]  they done something, they...
what?
Nice store, sir.
Go away in the back.
I'll take care of them. Go in the back.
They up to no good.
Can I help you, young man?
Can I help you?
[WOMAN] Harlan!
How much did you pay for that?
He asked you a question.
You got a problem hearing,
old man?
To acquire our services
for 30% of your business
a month.
Now wouldn't you say
that was fair?
You can't come
into this store...
it's okay, baby. It's okay.
Don't come in here and do this to us!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
We need all of it.
We need all of it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep a wrap on her, old man.
I made you an offer.
Need you to think about it.
Quentin, right?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm noelle.
What's up, Noelle. How are you doing?
I'm good.
Uh, listen,
I've seen you in town,
and I think you're
an amazing dancer.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So what I'm gonna do
is give you Mr. Welch's card.
The choreographer?
Yeah.
I've already told him
about you and everything.
So give him a call
and see what happens.
All right.
Word. Thanks.
No problem.
Bye.
[BALLET INSTRUCTOR]
Keep doing what you're doing.
Word.
 [DANCE]
[MAN]
That's what I'm talkin' about!
 I'm-a get right to it
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[MAN]
I need one minute, one minute,
one minute of y'all time, man.
I just gotta say that everything
that I'm doin' right now,
it all started with a dream,
a vision, a belief.
I lost my father
at eight months.
I lost my mom at twelve.
Was diagnosed
with diabetes at fourteen.
I grew up with several different
strikes all against me,
everybody was like, "yo,
he's gonna be out of there."
But I had a dream.
And through the grace of God,
the first time the world ever
heard me rap,
I won a grammy award.
The second time
they ever heard me rap
I-I won another grammy award.
So I just wanna tell you all
that the only limitations
that you'll ever have in life
are those that you
place upon yourself.
All right, real quick,
real quick,
before we get
to the next performance,
we gonna take a minute
to thank God
for the founder
of the underground.
Joliette's very own,
my man, Paalo.
[CHEERING]
And, yo, and have some respect
for this man's business,
man, because he's keeping
you focused
and off the streets,
so when you see him,
thank him, show him some love,
let him know we appreciate him.
A'ight?
A'ight, let's keep
this thing goin'!
 keep on dreaming
 I keep on believing
 I believe my dreams
will come true 
 I believe they
will come true 
 just keep on believing
 I keep on dreaming
what are you doin'?
Jumping on the bed.
Mmm. What did I tell you?
Don't jump on the bed.
That was a pretty song.
What did I tell you
about singin'?
We don't sing.
What...
Did I tell you...
About singin'?
We don't sing in this house.
Yeah.
No, don't hurt me, it hurts.
When you don't listen,
there are consequences.
Move!
What?
What are you lookin' at?
[NICOLE]
Where have you been?
I can't.
You can't what?
I can't do this.
Nah, I'm not saying anything.
A'ight, we got
some gorgeous ladies
comin' to the stage right now.
 As I look back
over my life 
 I know that you been
the only one that's... 
 been, been, been
consistent 
 you always been
by my side 
 through the good times,
the... 
 [MUFFLED]
It's me again.
Just find some way
to call me back.
Okay? Bye.
[SNIFFLING]
I'll take care of you.
Don't go.
Don't go, I'll take care of you.
[ECHOING]
Don't go nowhere.
Don't go to your mommy.
Stay with me, okay?
Sit down here, sit right here.
Sit down. Your daddy.
Sit right here with me.
 [MAN RAPPING]
 Keep on dancin'
 keep, keep on dancin'
 keep on dancin'
 [CONTINUING]
[MAN]
Hey, faggot!
I'm talkin' to you,
you black faggot!
[LAUGHING]
What's the matter, boy?
You scared, huh?
Mom and daddy ain't here
no more, now is they?
Hmm, what's the matter, baby?
It's all right, come on.
Calm down, boy, calm down.
It's a'ight.
It's okay.
What's the matter?
You knows you's

Hey!

[MUFFLED]

Okay, Michael.

Yes, sir.
High school.

or seventeen?
Seventeen years old, sir.

Um, nope.
That's good.
You have a good one.
You, too.
Hey, oh.
Uh, here you go.

Hold on a second.
You seem like a very
hard-worker.
Why don't you take that?
Thank you very much, sir.
You're welcome.
What?
You didn't even show any signs
that you heard anything
that I said.
Come on, what are you talk...

I heard everything you said.
I was just tryin' to deal
with the kid, all right?
I mean show some signs
that you care.
Please, please, don't...
don't do this, all right?
Just leave me alone, will ya?
Hey.
Hello.
Mia.
If you're not gonna park
your car in the garage,
would you at least get it
off the front drive?
It's tacky.
Okay.
And Mia?
Never mind.
I have a performance
at church coming up.
My first solo.
That's good.
Um, Jackson can't come
because he has to work.
Can you come?
Yeah, I'll be there.
Cool.
And I invited Jackson
to have lunch with us.
I really want you guys
to get along, I do.
Uh, just, try, at least.
What happened to your eye?
[MAN] You guys are running
around with some thugs.
Hey, babe, how are you doin'?
Hey. You, you got to duck, dawg.
Bob and weave. Foo-foo.
I gotta go.
I'll see you later.
Don't forget to duck, dawg.
Funny man.
Come on.
Just tryin' to help you, babe.
[ELISE]
Q, wait a second.
Q!
What is goin' on with you?
What's happening?
What's goin' on?
What's with this?
Dude, what's, come on.
Just take care of yourself
out there, okay?
Please? All right?
And learn how to fight.
Come on.
[CHUCKLES] You're so silly.
I'm out.
[MAN]
Weave and duck!
Hey, hold that door for me.
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
[SIGHS]
[CHUCKLES]
What's up, Lashawna?
Daddy!
Hey, baby, how you doing?
Good.
You know your daddy
missed you, right?
Yes.
Hey, what's up, AJ?
What's up, man?
Go back inside.
Go see your brother.
Look, I ain't got
no money for you.
Lashawna,
I don't want your money.
I don't have a place to stay
for you, either.
I got that covered, lashawna.
Really?
[WHISPERING]
It's good.
Who is he?
Listen, if you wanna see
your kids,
I'll take 'em
by your mother's house.
Okay?
I gotta go.
The money's in there.
All right?
Y'all know what to do with it.
So what we doin'?
What's up?
Yo, get out of here.
What you doin' here, huh?
The money's all we got.
Then why are you handin' me
that right now?
Huh?!
Look, man, it's bumper
to bumper on that corner.
It's like a mall.
So what are we doin' here,
anyway, man?
There's something I need to
see with my own eyes, man.
Let's roll.
Hey, where we goin'?
Boo, not you, man.
You talk too much.
Serious?
Very serious.
Hey, Donte?
Hey, Paalo.
Paalo!
Ya?
There's somebody
in the office looking for you.
Who is it?
Some lady.
What she want?
I think she want
to talk to you.
Okay. Mike?
Yeah?
Punchin' bag, straight punches.
Let me go see what.
All right.
 Invading my sanity
 political trumpets
 so I wrapped
the clouds around my mind 
So you believe in Jesus, now?
You think helpin' these kids
is gonna change who you are?
Do you remember
the time I was fightin'?
Everything was good.
It's my knee.
My knee went out from me.
I couldn't know what to do
no more.
[SCOFFS]
Yeah, all right.
That's all I know how to do.
I just know how to box.
When my knee gave out on me...
and let me tell you somethin',
Paalo.
Forgive me.
Let me talk to her.
Do not call my daughter
anymore.
My daughter does not want
to know you.
She does not need to know you.
As a matter of fact,
lose her number.
Please forgive me.
Let me talk to her.
It's been thirteen years.
Do you think I'm gonna change
my mind?
And I'm sorry and I can always
say I'm sorry about it.
We all, we have to learn
how to f-f-f to forgive.
I remember who you are,
and just because
you have a poster
with Jesus' name on it,
does not mean
that I have to forgive you.
Man, you call me you got me
waitin' out here?
Now open this door, man.
What you got?
I got $75.
$75?
Man, look, dawg. If it ain't a
hundred dollars, don't call me!
I got a TV.
Man, I don't want to hear that!
I don't want no TV!
If it ain't a hundred dollars
don't call me.
Man, you always doin' this.
Coming short.
Please.
Man, I don't want to hear that.
Don't come short on my money
no more, man.
Don't waste my time.
You washed up boxer.
[PAALO]
Do it outside, man.
What? What, man?
Thank you.
Yo, you was right, B.
This place is poppin'.
Told you.
All them kids going in and out.
It's clean.
Nobody even knows about it.
We can make
a lot of money here.
Hmm.
That's what's up.
I can make a lot of money
right here.
Yeah, I'm tryin' to come up
for real.
Yo-ho, Zo!
What's up, man.
Hey-hey,
let me call you back.
What's happenin' with you?
Nothin', man, how you been?
Man, just happy to be out, man.
For real.
Messes up man, I know while you
was down you did some writin'.
No time to do nothin' but
just write
and hit them weights, man.
That's it.
Just wanted to stop through,
see how you was doin' man.
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm good, man.
Fo' sure, fo' sure.
Hey, before you go,
let's go drop somethin'.
[SIGHS]
Man, it's been so long, man.
Man, ain't gonna take
but a minute.
Come on.
A'ight. Bet.
Nah, I'm good.
Yo, check out this track I got.
Bet.
 [STOPS]
What'd you think of that one?
It's cool.
You got somethin' else?
Yeah, I got some heat for you.
I need something that bang,
man!
I got ya.
I got ya.
That's it, right there.
All right, go on and drop it.
 I came from the dungeon
 it was smelly
in the lion's den 
 packaged up and shipped
 the product
of my environment 
 environment produced me
 mom's high, pop's gone
 that's the story usually
 there's no difference
from you and me 
 so "o" gs raised me
 showed me how
to package blow 
 livin' life in sin, seein'
wasn't in the natty though 
 yo, a young boy taking
wrong steps 
 couldn't hear
the lord's call 
 like I was tone deaf
 in love with the hood
 and since the hood
mirrored me apart from it 
 who would the person
in the mirror be? 
 there was no fear in me
 but scared
to embrace change 
 until
the lord's glory came 
 and rocked me
like freight train 
 that's when grace came
 what a great exchange
 took me
from the broken blocks 
 placed me
on a straight Lane 
 saved me from myself
 and the grave
I was digging me 
 he laid in it for me
 raised in it,
came to livin' in it 
 I ain't always been
who I am 
 knock it to my past
 see the sin in the man
 but he saves
from destruction 
 living in the grave
 and my ways
were disgustin' 
 I pray that you trust him
 yeah
man, that's different.
It's 'cause I'm different, man.
Man, see you still got
that heat, man.
Hey, right on.
Appreciate the love, man.
No problem.
No problem.
You know, you got it lookin'
good around here, man.
Well, you know,
Donte got us right.
Donte?
Yeah, you know I'm rollin'
with Donte's crew now.
Man, look out for that dude,
man.
Man, what'cha mean?
Just watch out for Donte, man.
You gonna come back?
[ANTHONY SIMS] I wish
someone would have told me
about the first time
my heart would be broken,
when I pray litany
my words float
through a broken sky,
angels rain down
to take my golden petitions,
but the word is so heavy.
Seraphim wings break,
like language, and I's tired.
We's scared.
We have learned to function
in dysfunction
and so many of us won't stop
until our hair is charred gray.
The only real way
to heal our broken center
is to speak out hearts
bleed out to you listener,
on pages and open mics,
hear our broken words,
back-alley embraces,
cell phone conversations,
and those fragile moments
amongst friends
when it's okay to cry.
And you listener,
yes, you listener,
lift our burdens
and break them.
So the next time you hear
the secret thoughts
that pour from our eyes,
I want you to listen.
Um, Paalo is my man.
He just-asked me to come here,
um, and it ma-his name
makes sense,
Paalo, because
he ain't pay me nothin'.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Um, growin' up,
just so you know,
I was-I was poor.
We weren't even poor,
we was po'.
We couldn't, couldn't afford
the other letters, man.
My parents, like, they
would try to buy us stuff,
but they couldn't buy us
everything we needed,
like, we had the game
operation,
right, but we ain't had
no batteries, you know?
Then, then my cousin came over
and he figured out a way how to
plug it into the wall, right?
It's a whole 'nother game, you know?
It's a whole other game.
We called it operation
roulette is what we called it
because it was, like we was
poor, we was just...
I was actually being sponsored
by a family from Haiti,
so we was just like,
we was really,
we was really bad.
Hey, so what I'm excited about being
able to come here and talk to you about
is, listen, uh, I'm blessed,
I get to do comedy,
you've seen me on all of
the shows
and all of the cool stuff,
but, uh, my talent
isn't any greater
than anybody's
talent that's in here.
Like, everyone here
has an equal talent.
Even if you're not on stage,
even if you're a plumber,
you have...
you have a equal gift to me.
It's just a matter of about lookin'
for an opportunity to give it away,
and then that's when
you really will feel fulfilled.
It's not just about you,
it's about, "what can I give?"
And the more obstacles
that are in the way,
the stronger you're gonna be
when you finally reach
the goal.
So you just gotta press on
toward the mark
and get it done.
[MAN]
That's right.
So, I'm gonna go.
Thanks for listenin'.
[WOMAN]
All right.
[ALONZO]
Tommy, what up with you, man?
Can't sleep.
Figured I'd go in here to write you.
I got a chance
to see my kids today
and it's amazin' how we
take things for granted
until they taken away from you.
My son is actin' like he don't
even really want to talk to me.
Even lashawna got
some dude she stayin' with.
And I ain't gonna lie, man.
It-it ain't, it ain't as easy
as I thought it was gonna be.
But, man, it felt so good
to see my little girl
and it's funny, man,
I live right down the alley
from this dude named Paalo.
I used to serve him back
in the day.
He was a dope fiend.
Now, man, he-he own a spot
called the underground.
He be helpin' kids
and it's just amazin' how
time, man, can change people.
Man, gotta go see
this parole officer
and he already been on me
about gettin' a job
and you know
how difficult it is
to get a job
with what I got on my record?
You block your dreams
when you allow your fear
to grow bigger than your faith.
[PHONE RINGING]
Why are they coming
through the back door?
Come on in.
Where?
In here, silly.
Come on.
Okay, that's a first.
Your mom must be gone, right?
Whatever.
I'm not a child.
I'm not gonna sneak my friends
into the house.
Well, then, why have we
never been invited in?
Oh, it's really nice.
I know you gotta have
a place for me up in here.
Come on.
Can we get a tour?
[CLEARS THROAT]
Hey!
[LAUGHS]
Oh. Hey.
I'm sorry to-to surprise
you like that.
Julian Welch.
Every dancer knows who you are.
I know who you are.
Quentin, right?
Right.
Right.
So you, uh,
you left me a message
about, um,
internships, applications?
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.
I mean, I just figured
you would be able
to help me out with something.
Yeah, I know your work.
You're gifted, gifted.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
I-I-I see that.
But, um, the world
is full of gifted dancers.
Yeah.
Now, um, applications,
I don't know, that seems
a very traditional route.
I mean, these days
anyone can get one online.
And non-traditional?
Invitations.
It's rare
for a dancer to get one,
but, uh, it happens.
You've got to perform,
but you've got to really stand
out for the work to find you.
Hmm?
Invitations, Quentin.
Invitations.
I have a friend
who runs a dance company.
He has a school in the suburbs.
About 40% of his staff
is in the company.
I could put in a good word
for you.
Of course,
you'd have to do the rest.
Thank you, Mr. Welch.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
So what are you going to do
about it?
Get a job.
Well, this is when people like
you
usually fall back
into old habits.
It ain't easy.
But you going to have to
get a job and hold onto it
in order to go to level two,
so let's get to it.
I'll see you back here
in two weeks.
All right.
Good luck.
Check it.
Leonard, go home.
So is it true
that a man finds religion
once he hits rock bottom?
Business is looking good.
Almost as good as those belts
hanging on my wall,
but you don't seem
to miss 'em much.
You haven't dropped by
to say hi in awhile.
What you doin' here?
I owe you.
You supported my business.
And what kind of a man
would I be
if I didn't support yours?
I know people.
People know people.
It's the way of survival.
Now I can get the dough
rolling in.
You can be sittin'
on retirement
as I run the show.
I'm not sellin' it.
Just give me the opportunity.
These kids mean a lot to me,
and I'm not sellin' it.
[CHUCKLES]
I'm flattered
that you thought I was askin'.
Just s-s-leep on it, okay?
Sleep.
Oh, and by the way,
how's your daughter doin'?
Hey!
Now, pride breeds quarrels,
but wisdom is found
in those who take advice.
Store you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
And we need to get some more...
It's cold out there, baby.
Yes, it is.
Cold out there.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?
You dropped your wallet.
Oh-oh, wha-well, thank you!
No problem.
Oh, man.
Thank you.
Lemme give you somethin'
for this.
Nah, no, no.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.
I'm-do you need some help
around here?
Well, I'm just opening up
the store,
but I tell you what,
come back tomorrow.
We'll see what we can do.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you. Thank you, bro.
Thank you so much.
All right.
All right.
Looky, honey,
he brought my wallet back.
[WOMAN]
You're doin' great,
and on top of that,
you're comin' up on a year
that you've kept friends.
They probably think I'm crazy.
I invited them in the house.
Okay, that's good.
And-and what happened?
Paalo's got
some industry people coming.
I don't know when,
but that's what I heard.
They were walkin' around.
[NICOLE] What, I mean, Mia,
we could be signed artists.
Tianna?
And they opened
the garage door.
[GASPS]
That's just the garage.
He can't hurt you anymore.
It's hard.
Nothin' else matters.
You're already making
your own decisions.
You're leavin' the house
by yourself every day.
You're makin' friends.
Well, maybe the friends,
maybe, maybe the singing,
maybe none of that's...
none of that stuff matters.
You're so used
to the isolation.
Isolation helps clear the mind.
It frees you.
But be not afraid.
The darkness,
it'll help you to
overcome your fears.
Don't take yourself
back to that place.
Listen to me!
How do you feel?
It's time for you to start
making your own decisions.
I'm not gonna turn
the light off this time.
You are.
Even though you don't see me,
know that I'm here with you.
Now, when I close this door,
I want you to do
exactly what I said.
Do you understand?
Yes.
How do you feel
about your mother?
I feel trapped.
Abandoned.
She did...
she didn't protect me.
She doesn't care.
She does these spiteful things.
She goes in my room
and she arran...
rearranges everything
and, you know, she stopped
paying for my tuition
when I started seeing you.
She doesn't care.
[SIGHS]
Well, that's our time, sweetie.
The goal is to find
your identity
and mending the relationship
with your mother
is just as important
as all the other tasks
that I've given you.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
You didn't know what
you was doin', man.
You were scared out your mind.
Well, at least I knew to take
the safety off, first.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Go get the door.
Yes, boss.
Ma, what-what's goin' on?
When lashawna drop
the kids off?
About four o'clock
this afternoon.
I wish y'all
would'a let me know.
I could'a got here earlier.
And what difference
would that goin' make?
Ma, I could'a spent
some time with the kids.
And did what?
Like took 'em somewhere, momma.
Okay, well they in there.
You can do that now.
Can I get some money?
Don't worry about it, momma.
What's this?
Mike said it was
that information
about that cop
you was lookin' after.
So what's that all about,
anyway?
Mind your business.
Mia.
Sit down.
Over here.
Closer.
[WOMAN ON TV] Have you ever
had a dream or aspiration
that didn't come out
the way you thought
it would come out?
When I was younger,
I prayed about this young man.
Ooh, I wanted that man.
Ladies, you know
that man I'm talkin' about.
[TV AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Now, I wanted that man,
couldn't understand
why God never put us together.
Wasn't 'til years later
I turned on the TV one night
and saw him on "cops."
That's when I realized
if God answered all my prayers,
I'd be in deep trouble, right?
Do you believe in God?
Because I don't know what's best for
me most of the time but he does.
Because I've always had
some bad taste
my worst relationship
was physically abusive.
A lot of people say,
"what are you talkin'
about that on stage, Kathy?"
And I say, "'cause, see,
it needs to be discussed."
Because, see, a lot of people don't
think black women get abused.
Oh, we do, mm-hmm.
It's just that very few men
have lived to tell about it.
 Yeah, I raise my hands
to the sky 
 [CONTINUES SINGING]
I just really appreciate you
for this.
Man, you just don't know.
Yeah, I got an idea.
You know, Mr. Harlan,
just growin' up
without a father,
bein' in some
of the situations I was in.
You think the reason why
you went to jail or somethin'
'cause you didn't have
a father?
I think that's a big part
of it, Mr. Harlan.
My son had a father.
He had everything he needed.
Bachelor's degree,
came outta college,
didn't have to pay nothin',
didn't have no debt.
He's sittin' there in jail
for life.
Yeah, and he had a good daddy.
And a good momma.
Ain't that right, babe?
That's right.
It don't matter whether
you got a father or not
if you ain't got no damn sense.
Got all them stuff in there,
any-anything else in the back,
back there?
Yeah, she said
in order to re-enroll,
I had to pay this ridiculous
amount of money.
Yeah, I know.
Okay. All right.
Bye.
Hey, I think I've seen you
somewhere before, right?
At the underground?
Yeah, that too,
but I think I've seen you
dancing at the bridge, right?
Quentin.
Quentin.
You're pretty amazing, Quentin.
Thanks.
So you like it?
The underground?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,
it's, uh, it's nice.
It was actually my first time.
It's addictive.
You'll be back.
[SIGHS]
How do you do it?
Do what?
The way you dance,
the way you move.
It's so free.
It's all I got.
Figured I'd come on this court
and teach you some things.
What you gonna teach me?
Man, you know how long
I been balling?
Man, let's go.
Let's see what you got out here.
I already have somebody
that been teachin' me,
while you were gone.
Look, AJ, man,
I know I ain't been able to be...
what's up, coach?
[COACH] What's up, AJ?
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm Shi.
What's up?
Aj's mentor and coach.
What's up?
I'm Alonzo.
I'm aj's father.
Oh, okay, cool.
Well, we about to go over
some drills.
You welcome to stand on the side
and watch us.
A'ight.
Let's go, man.
Let's go.
Drive.
Drive.
Good shot.
Go.
Pop!
Pop and drive.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hi.
Is Quentin home?
No.
What's your name?
Donte.
You grew up with my brother,
didn't you?
Yeah, but we lost touch,
though.
Look, if you see him,
just tell him I got some
information for him.
Okay, well, you wanna come in
and wait for him?
He should be home in a second.
Just come in.
Come on.
[CLEARS THROAT]
All right, AJ,
see you in a couple days.
Bye-bye.
Let's go with some one-on-one.
Bet you I take you to the hole.
I ain't got no game out here.
Check up.
You ain't got no game out here.
Check up.
Yeah.
It's all good, man.
Good job.
You doin' all right?
[PANTING]
You sure?
Watch how I cross you over.
Got him!
Told you,
you ain't got no game.
Now check up.
Man, you ain't been around
to know what kinda game I got!
AJ, look, I-I messed up.
You know how often I wish I could
get that time back with you?
Ain't nothin' I can do
to get that time back.
AJ, I'm sorry!
I love you, AJ.
I love you.
Okay.
You been okay?
Yeah.
And your family?
It's been a long time.
Quentin?
It's me, babe.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie, how you doin'?
This is Donte.
Hey...
Jackson.
[DONTE] Yo, look I'll catch
him some other time.
We need to talk.
Okay?
You have no idea what's goin'
on in your brother's life.
I know!
I know what Donte does.
But I also know
my brother and I
know that he's not involved
in any of that.
Look, he-he came over
to talk to Quentin.
That was it!
He did not come over here
to hurt anyone!
What does he want to talk
to Quentin about?
You know, it doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter.
He came to talk to him.
He did not come here
to hurt anyone.
Come on, give me
more credit than that.
You know what, honey, from now
on, leave your badge at work.
Elise?
Leave your badge at work.
Elise, you have not seen
what I've seen, baby.
You haven't seen the things
that they're doing out there!
Jackson! Whatever you think
about Quentin is wrong, okay?
It's wrong!
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.
There he is!
Right on time.
Guys, this is the young man I've
been telling you so much about.
Quentin, meet Eric Gordon.
[GORDON] Eric Gordon.
Hi, Eric.
Pleasure to meet with you.
Meet Ruth Mcmillan.
Hi, we're so glad you're here.
Hi.
And maryanne tomlin.
Maryanne.
How nice to meet you.
Just some of the faculty.
This is the school.
Welcome.
I'm gonna show Quentin
around a bit,
so I'll catch up
with you guys later.
If that's okay?
[GORDON] Perfect, great, thanks.
And, you, sir,
come with me, sir.
Let me show you the place.
Hi, Mr. Welch.
Hey, Brandy.
How are you?
I'm good.
This is Quentin.
Quentin, this is Brandy.
Brandy, how you doin'?
I'm good.
They're great, huh?
They good.
You could make them amazing.
And teaching them would help me
get into the dance company?
No.
But it'll get you noticed.
And being noticed
will help you a lot more
than dancing at that gym.
Lemme see what you got.
Is he serious?
I think so.
Lemme show you what I got.
Good stuff, kid.
Good stuff.
 [MAN RAPPING]
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Good class?
Yeah, we got it in.
Oh, well, good.
You know, Mr. Welch can't stop
boastin' about you, right?
First it was your dance.
Now it's your work
with the kids.
So, he's really impressed.
Well, I'm mad grateful.
Thank you for introducing us.
Oh, no problem.
You got any plans for tonight?
Yeah, I'm gonna check out the underground.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Okay.

Oh, hmm, nah.

Go ahead and get my money.
Go ahead, get my money!
[LASHAWNA] Please, let's go,

Alo, seriously?
You cannot keep showin' up

I just wanna see the kids.
Well, we gotta go, so.
Well, let me watch them.

Scotty Pippen.
Magic Johnson.
James worthy.
So you a magic Johnson fan?
Who would you rather have

'Cause he is the tallest,

I don't snore.
Trust me, you snore.
I don't snore.
When'd you take this?
Mmm, oh, that was last summer.
That was her birthday party.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just like her mother.
Please.
I looked a mess that day.
You were pregnant with her
in this picture, right?
Yeah, I was.
Im'a get ready to go.
Okay.
That's a good idea.
Let you get some rest. All right?
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.
See you later.
Mia?
I'm glad you came back.
So im'a see you next week?
Sure.
Good.

So, how's it going this week,

[ALONZO]
It is what it is, man.
Just goin'.
Oh, it's better than that.
You the captain of the ship.
Where the ship goin'?
If I was the captain
of the ship

Now you the architect
of your life, man.
You gotta have a vision,

30 days from now?
90 days from now?
You tell me.
Now, how you gonna plan
for somethin'
when the things
that's coming at you,
you didn't plan for them
in the first place?
Well, you got a job.
Well, a job don't fix
all your problems.
I definitely see that.
Well, I know unless you keep
that job and stay on the path,
you know where
you're gonna be back at.
I ain't goin' back to jail,
that's for sure.
Well, three out of four people
that sit in that chair
end up back in jail.
We done?
[SIGHS]
Don't let your challenges cause
you to do something stupid, son.
See you back here in two weeks.

Everything okay?
Just takin' care of some stuff.
Okay, but are we ready

Actually, uh, I'm not singin'
tonight with you guys.
I just came to support.
You gotta be kidding me.
You're the one who asked us
to be in this group.
This was your idea.
And you haven't performed
with us once.
What's wrong with you, scared?
Come on, girl.
Listen, just pretend that there's
nobody else around, okay?
Just-we're just at her house,
we're rehearsing and everything
will be fine. Come on. Do it.
Okay?
So you gonna do it?
Come on.
Come on.
[MAN] We have some ladies
comin' to the stage
that want to sing
some a cappella.
Let's see what they can do.
Show some love!
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
Thank you.
We have a song called "I'll wait."
 So I'll wait to hang

 so I'll wait...
 On you
 oh, until your voice
 is the only sound
 that can be heard
Mia!

[SIGHS]
[MIA'S FATHER]
What...
Did I tell you about singin'?
You broke it!
Cheat the...
Man, I don't got nothin'.
Oh, here we go.
The X-Men,
a team of mutants
who used their super powers
to sell a lot of comic books
and movie tickets.
Okay, you guys.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, we gotta go.
Mom, why we goin'?
What? Why we got to go, momma?
Where are your coats?
Why do we have to go? Man.
Let's get your coats.
Hold up, lashawna,

Come on, let's get your coats.
Why we gotta go?
Lashawna, where you goin'?
But I just got back from
seein' my parole officer.
So?
I could watch the kids. Please.
Lashawna, I could watch the kids
while you run your errands.
Listen to me!
Listen, I got evicted, okay?
Mason is gone!
Do you understand that?
Hold up, where you goin'?
I'm going to my sister's house.
The one that live a hour away?
How am I see you and the kids,
lashawna?
That's the only sister I got.
What do you want me to do?
Lashawna, please, I...

I didn't think so.
Lashawna, I just wanna spend
some time with you and the kids.
I know. Let's go.
Let's go.
Why you...

Damn!
[ON ANSWERING MACHINE]
Hey, Mia, it's Tianna.
It's okay.
Everyone gets stage fright.
All right, well,

I been waitin' for you, Mia.
Sit down.
You're gonna call your mom,

Okay, okay.
No. Please stop.
Don't.
Hello, mom?
Mom, it's me, Mia.
I'm in the city.
Mom, can you come get me,
please?
I need you.
Hello?
Come with me.
Come on, sit down.
You can stay here.
I just can't.
I can't go home.
And I can't sleep.
Uh. Sorry I'm late.
This, uh, this looks...
this looks... this looks
absolutely delicious.
I lost my job.
Yeah.
But everything
is going to be okay.
All right?
Okay? Eat.
Eat.
What is this?
This isn't...
is this...
it's chicken?
It's a funny thing,
there was a, uh... [CLEARS THROAT]
Today at work I saw a rabbit.
[LAUGHING]
It was a...
it was a white rabbit.
It was, uh...
and there were two
other people that they, uh...
it was hopping...
it's, uh.
Mia?
Look at me.
Baby, I love you.
You understand?
And baby, I am...
I am so proud of you.
All right?
Okay, get your plate.
Wait a minute, wait, wait,
hold on.
What are you doin'?
No. Put that down.
Put it down.
Me and your mother we'll,
we'll handle that.
Run me a shower.
Now.
Are you gonna eat that?
Just run the shower.
It's fine.
No, it's fine.
All right, thank you.
Mia, go help your mother.
There was a rabbit.
He was always staring off
into space.
He was there but it was almost
like he wasn't really there.
I was alone.
Mia, go get your father.
There's something wrong
with the shower.
My parents died here.
A semi-truck smashed
right into the car.
[WHISPERING]
Boom.
It happened right over there.
How can you come here?
I'm always runnin'.
It seems like the safest place.
What are you running from?
After they died,
I remember elise
and I going to his house.
[SNIFFLES]
We're staying
with Uncle Reggie now.
I remember one night he came
into my room and,
at that time
I didn't think nothin' of it.
He put his hand on my head.
I thought he was tryin'
to comfort me.
We gotta get you clean, boy.
I had this caller today.
Seventeen year old boy,
a little sissy boy,
kinda looked like you.
And it made me think
what would I do
if I came home
and that sissy boy
was in my house?
You that sissy boy, ain't you?
[LAUGHING]
That's why I got you
in handcuffs.
Do you understand me?
[LAUGHING]
What I'm gonna do?
You know I'm the police,
don't you?
Ain't nobody do nothin' to me.
You will get nowhere in life
without some pain,
so you have to experience
some pain
in order to succeed in life.
And you are about to experience
some pain, boy.
Elise and I never told anybody
what happened in that house.
Yeah, im'a be over there
as soon as I leave here.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
A'ight, I'll see ya.
What's wrong with you?
Kind of mopey today, huh?
Man, it's hard,
Mr. Harlan, you know?
What's hard?
I mean I really appreciate
everything you did done for me.
I mean, but, you know, you payin'
me what you can, $40 a day,
and I'm used to bein'
in the streets, you know,
I grew up out in the streets with
gangsters gettin' real money.
Okay.
And, you know,
it's hard just gettin'
somethin' where I could barely
even get by.
So what are you sayin'?
You don't want this job?
I ain't sayin' that.
Well, what are you sayin'?
I'm just sayin' it's difficult.
I don't got what you got.
I don't own no store.
You don't got what I got?
I just hired you.
I'm standing up here
tryin' to sell something.
What you got that I got?
What you talkin' about?
Let's get down with it.
I'm just sayin' Mr. Harlan,
when you used to makin' money the
way I'm used to makin' money,
you get put in situations
where I can't even provide
for my family, my kids.
I understand that,
but you know what you doin'?
You comin' here soundin' like
you blamin' me for your life.
Now, I gave you a job.
I understand
you got outta jail.
I understand about your family,
but don't blame me for life.
I gave you a job.
Now that's simple as that.
I'm not gonna sit up here
and feel like I'm sufferin'
because you can't make it.
I can't make it either.
[SIGHS]
We both in the same situations.
A'ight, Mr. Harlan.
Mm-hmm.
Talk to you later.
 I'm broken and insane
 please just take control
 don't know what to say
 don't know where to go
 broken in my soul
this guy, you stay on him.
Today is the day
that you fight back.
You don't have no place to run.
[CHUCKLES]
So what can I do for you,
old friend?
Uh, hold on, let me guess.
You need somethin' from me.
Need somethin'?
How about you owe me for the time
I spent in the joint for you?
Let's not act like you came
here for no apology.
You came here for some money.
Look, man, lemme just move
a couple things...
[CHUCKLES]
Make some quick money
and I'm out.
Look, man,
you got a second chance.
Look, do me a favor
and get outta my face!
 [MAN SINGING REGGAE]
Hey, Quentin, need a ride?
No, I'm good, Mr. Welch.
Nonsense. Hop in.
[MAN] And what a
fight we got up here
in the middleweight
championship,
Osumanu and Upshaw
are about to do battle.
It's gonna be a good one.
For you.
All your hard work
and dedication.
You really mean a lot
to those kids.
This is perfect timing.
My brother-in-law, he's been
getting on me about getting a job.
And in this corner middleweight
international IBO champion
Osumanu machine gun Adama
with trainer and former
champion Paalo Awinongya.
[SIGHS]
[GRUNTS]
So, so, Quentin.
What are your plans, hmm?
Hmm?
I never planned out my life.
[CHUCKLES]
If I had, it wouldn't be...
well, it wouldn't be like this.
[CHUCKLES]
[BELL RINGS]
Come on, Osu.
[MAN] Left. Quick left
hook there from Adama.
Let's go, Adama!
You get into the company,
don't stop there. All right?
Climb higher.
Don't settle.
All right?
Yeah, I settled.
Yeah, yeah.
I got comfortable.
Married.
Now she's about to have a baby.
Mr. Welch,
wow, that's pretty...
don't-don't,
don't say anything.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[SIGHS]
I just... I just want you
to know that great things,
great things can happen for you
if you just... if you just
open yourself up to them.
Hmm?
I'm saying
don't ever stop going
after what you really want,
no matter what you have to do
to achieve it.
Some body blows there
from Upshaw!
And that'll wrap up
the first round.
Hey, hey!
Success is hard-earned, hmm?
[CHUCKLES]
How often we have to do things
we don't wanna do.
But we do them anyway.
Sometimes, sometimes
we end up likin' them.
Hmm? Like working
with the children?
Hey.
Working with the children?
You like it, don't you?
Don't you?
Relax.
[WHISPERING]
Relax.
This fight
has really heated up.
Here comes Upshaw
with the assault.
[MAN]
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
And down goes Upshaw.
What a vicious blow from Adama.
Upshaw is down
and he will not get up.
He's fought hard,
he's trained hard,
and now he's the champion
and all Adama's friends
now enter the ring
to celebrate his victory.
And look at the joy on trainer
Paalo's Awinongya's face.
The first boxer he's ever trained
is back on top of the sport.
Thank you!
Hey, babe?
Yeah?
How your rehearsals coming?
Oh, they're going good.
Yeah?
I wish you could come
to the church and see us.
I wish I could come, too, baby.
I want to come
but I gotta work, you know,
but I'll see
if I can get some...
there's your money.
I got a job!
What's wrong with him?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Wait! Wait, Jackson, wait.
[JACKSON]
Let go of me!
Let me go! No, let me go!
No! Don't!
I don't want your drug money.
Get out of my room.
No, no, you get
out of my house.
Man, get out of my room!
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Get outta my room!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, me?
Me? No, no, okay.
Hey, bro, you can stay.
No problem.
I'm gonna get out
of y'all's house.
I'm out.
I'm out!
I'm outta here!
Quentin, what happened?
What happened?
What happened, honey?
Quentin, talk to me.
Don't, don't go,
what are you doing?
Talk to me!
Talk to me.
I gotta go.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Don't!
Quentin, please!
God.
Look right here.
This is where they took it out
of, right out of this drawer.
They knew where to come
to get the money.
Rob it right in here
in my drawer.
They vandalized
the whole store.
Look what they did
to our store.
Mr. Harlan, what happened?
Where you been?
You did this!
Oh-oh, come on, now, he did
nothing-he didn't do it, edna.
What else is missing,
Mr. Harlan?
Well, officer, everything.
Ask my wife
and she'll show you.
Show the man what's missing.
Officer, she'll show
you what's missing.
They just vandalized
the whole store.
I'll tell you they took
crates of things.
Can I talk to you,
Mr. Harlan?
Alonzo, would you just please,
help us pick up the stuff.
Man, come right here in my face and
showed me he was gonna rob me.
And my store...
Mr. Harlan,
can I talk to you, please?
Mr. Harlan is this the kid you
were talking about the other day?
Yes, yes, this is him.
Mr. Harlan,
I really need to talk to you.
Well, well, look, can I-can I
talk to you?
Alonzo!
Go ahead, go, come on,
come that's okay.
Pick up some of that stuff.
Listen, I hear you do
good work here.
See, Mr. Harlan needs
all the manpower he can get.
Look, you-you go ahead
with the heavy stuff
and I'll work with the broom.
About the money...
unless you wanna use the broom.
All right, Mr. Harlan,
we're gonna get started
on that report, okay?
Yeah.
Excuse me, where's Mr. Q?
I've got no idea.
[CHILDREN] No idea. I haven't seen him.
All right.
Mr. Welch!
Yes?
Oh my, oh my God, are you okay?
Yes. Just sore.
From my car accident.
Can I help you?
Oh, um, yeah,
I was looking for Quentin.
Have you seen him?
No. No. Okay?
Okay.
[MAN] We'd like to get into
the next one right now!
[WOMAN]
Hey, yo, back up, back up.
[MAN]
Back up! Back up.
Hey, let him through, y'all,
let him through.
[ECHOING]
[ECHOING] Let's go, Q.
Relax.
And I wanna do something for ya
to show you how much I
appreciate you being
such a nice, young man
and everything
here is your fault.
I didn't ask for you.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Don't move.
Don't move.
Stay right there.
Get against the wall
right there.
Get against the wall!
What's your name, son?
Quentin Anderson.
What do you know
about Julian Welch?
Mr. Welch?
Man, he attacked me first, man.
What are you doin', man?
Calm down.
Why y'all comin' after me?
Hey, squad, I got the battery
suspect here.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.
Hey, get up off me, man!
Why you comin' after me?
I didn't do nothin' wrong, man?
Keep your tone down, all right?
Man, why do I gotta calm down?
Man, I'm the victim!
Everything okay, fellas?
You need to relax, man.
Did I hear a positive ID?
Reggie? Reggie?
Is this the troublemaker?
You did this.
You did this!
You raped me.
I was just a boy!
A boy!
Why'd you do it?
Why?
That's the one who raped me!
Now let me go!
Let me go!
Did you do it?
What?
Rape him?
I don't even know that kid.
I mean, I was his Uncle,
but I haven't seen him
in years.
He was even troubled back then.
Huh.
What's up, fellas?
Hey, Jackson,
how's it goin' man?
What we got he we got.
Q?
Oh, God.
Hey, hey Q.
Q.
[CRYING]
Come on, man.
[PHONE RINGING]
You're on in two minutes.
Okay.
Hey.
You caught me just in time.
You callin' to wish me luck?
No. No, listen, listen, listen.
Um, got some bad news.
It's about... it's about Q.
He didn't make it, babe.
Jackson, what did you say?
What?
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
[APPLAUSE]
I was supposed to protect him.
But I didn't know.
It's okay, baby.
I didn't know.
It's okay, it's okay.
After our parents died,
and we went to live
with my Uncle,
I was supposed to protect him.
Okay, okay.
Hey, it's not your fault, baby.
Talk to me.
He's my baby brother.
I know. I know, baby.
I know.
Hmm?
It's cool.
[BOBBY]
You sure?
There's somethin'
I need you to do for me.
Baby we had all kinds of women
with like nothing, you know,
you right up your alley, dawg,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, high times, baby.
Hey, yo, Jack straight up.
On his tab.
Hmm, who are you?
You gotta know who I am.
Ah.
[CHUCKLING]
Well, you're all alike, boy.
Look, I don't mess
with you or your boys,
so you can just go on
and go somewhere else.
My boys.
Yeah.
My boys.
Your boys.
Look, tell me somethin'.
How many boys does it take
to make a party fun?
It takes two.
[WHISPERING]
Just two.
[SIGHS]
 [WOMAN SINGING]
Bye.
Bye.
You look so beautiful.
You look like your momma.
I'm sorry it took me 13 years.
I should'a called more.
I should'a try...
I should'a been there for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
If it's okay
for me to give you a hug?
No.
Wait!
I got this for you.
[VERONICA]
Mia. Where you going?
Where you goin'?
I'm leaving.
Mom, I...
I just really need
to leave here.
Well, then, go.
Mia?
Well, I heard what he said
that night.
How much he loved you.
You know what he said to me?
Go run him a shower.
Everything
was always about you.
And now you wanna leave me.
[WEEPS]
I gotta go.
Now, that was easy.
That's all it took.
Just one question
to get you here.
Well, your nephew not here.
But you knew that
'cause you were there.
I wanna go home.
This is your home, boy.
Now turn around.
Come here.
I want you to grab his hand.
You grab his hands.
It's either him or you.
Now, how many boys does it take
to make a party fun?
Two.
Do you know what I wish?
I wish, I wish he was here.
So you could see both
of our faces one last time.
[CHUCKLING]
You boys,
you boys act like you
were victimized.
I didn't hurt you.
I didn't do anything to you.
I gave you what you wanted.
Love.
You wanna turn that around
on me now?
Okay, see, I have a career.
You... you have nothing.
You are nothing.
And I'm not gonna let
Quentin...
I didn't let Quentin...
and I'm not gonna let you,
or anybody else,
take that away from me.
Now, put your hands up.
Turn around, boy,
and put your hands up!
[CHUCKLES]
Remember that?
Boy, mmm.
You gonna come up in here
without a gun, boy? Huh?
[CHUCKLES]
Man, I ain't no boy no more.
You...
you are pathetic.
[GUN FIRES]
Now what the hell did you... give me
a reason to blow your brains out.
I dare you!
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Shut!
Get your hands
behind your back right now.
You all right?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Think about runnin'?
No, man, we had a deal.
I do what I say im'a do.
Come on.
Yo, man, this is it.
Just came to pay
my last respect.
I'm officially done, man.
So you out, huh?
[SCOFFS]
Is that right?
I'm out.
A'ight.
Do you.
All right.
All right, jermaine.
[JERMAINE LAUGHS]
So you say he was talkin'
to some cops, huh?
Yeah, man, he had him come
by the office.
He made us leave.
Then he had some packages
come from the cops.
Hmm.
I think he's shady.
I think he a snitch.
Hmm, well you know what
to do then, right?
Gladly.
[SIGHS]
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, have you seen Paalo?
Yeah, he stepped out
for a second.
Well, can you make sure
he gets this?
Yeah.
You just put it right there.
Okay.
Tommy what up, mag?
You know that man money I took?
Man, I tried to give him
his money back,
and he wouldn't take it.
My p.O. Asked me,
do I have any dreams
for the future.
If you would'a asked me that
before I went in the joint,
my dream was simply
to get money,
but now I realize a dream
is not just some pivotal moment
you accomplish ten years
from now,
but it's about today
and what you do every day
until you get there.
Hey, Mia, you on.
 The sound of heaven
fills the road 
 and we sing it
'cause we love you 
 yes, we love you
 sound of heaven
fills the room 
 and we sing it
because we love you 
 yes, we...
 [HUMMING]
 Emotional blackmail
 that's your specialty
 it doesn't work for me
 a double-faced joker
 with an evil side,
like a Jekyll-Hyde 
 you won me over
but you couldn't deliver 
 you're just a taker,
disguised as a giver 
 you can't hold me hostage
 or tie me up in chains
 not gonna make you stay
 you had my heart,
but lost it 
 you tried controlling me,
nobody's holding me 
 only sin in your eyes
 from your lips
full of lies 
 you can't hold me hostage
 time for me to move on
 goodbye, baby, I'm gone
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
 I'm gone
 don't talk about ransom
 because you gotta know
 that you can't buy my love
 it's time
for some truth now 
 and some consequence
at your expense 
 you bend my will,
but you never could break me 
 I'm not a prisoner
here for your taking 
 you can't hold me hostage
 can't tie me up in chains,
not gonna make you stay 
 you had my heart,
but lost it 
 you tried controlling me,
nobody's holding me 
 only sin in your eyes
 from your lips only lies
 you can't hold me hostage
 time for me to move on
 goodbye, baby, I'm gone
 gone, gone, gone
 if you're gonna do
the crime 
 then you gotta do the time
 gone, gone, gone, gone
 ahhh!
 Oooh!
 Oh!
 You can't hold me hostage
 can't tie me up in chains
 not gonna make you stay
 you had my heart,
but lost it 
 you tried controlling me
 nobody's owning me
 only sin in your eyes
 from your lips only lies
 you can't hold me hostage
 time for me to move on
 goodbye, baby, I'm gone
 I'm gone
 [HUMMING]
 [STOPS]
 Who do you think you are
 to take what wasn't yours?
 The innocence
I once adored 
 was stripped away
behind closed doors 
 the enemy's inside my head
 but who would ever
listen to me 
 and all the secrets
that you made me keep 
 rain's on the window pane,
darkness surrounding me 
 footsteps outside my door
 right now I'm sound asleep
 the door opens slowly
 and I can hear it slightly
 but I don't move or even look
to see who it might be 
 someone's next to me
 their weight is on my bed
 my covers pulling back
 a hand is on my leg
 I want to sneak and peek but I
just can't seem to let myself 
 is my father
checking me 
 I'm nine and I often
wet myself 
 I have no options fear got
me too gripped to even move 
 supposed to protect but abusing
me, now, I'm so confused 
 so many emotions
 ...and I lay there
motionless 
 hoping this night
is soon to be over with 
 holding back cries
my mind is racing 
 those eyes
I could not awaken 
 I'd rather die than be
in this situation 
 as he leaves I knew this
secret I buried and hide 
 but hiding this secret, I
just seem to be buried alive 
 who do you think you are
 to take what wasn't yours?
 The innocence
I once adored 
 was stripped away
behind closed doors 
 the enemy's inside my head
 but who would ever
listen to me 
 and all the secrets
that you made me keep 
 and it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 I'm old and on my own now
 I'm grown now
 but these secrets
won't leave me alone now 
 I felt my innocence
melt away 
 was living promiscuous,
freely giving myself away 
 why would I protect you?
 Truth I would hide
and cover 
 would anyone believe me?
 How could I tell
my mother? 
 confusion turned to sadness
 sadness led
to me stressin' 
 stressin' led to the anger
 anger led to depression
 and I was arrested
by the truth 
 that would truly free me
 the gospel gripped my heart
 showed me how
the father'd see me 
 biblical counsel and brothers
and sisters in my midst 
 helped me through it, though
it happened, I'd never forget 
 but I do have a hope
 that I could truly know
 in heaven every memory
will be whiter than snow 
 so ...Trouble to forgive you,
I fight 'cause I must 
 I must forgive you 'cause
I know he's forgiven me 
 who do you think you are
 to take what wasn't yours?
 The innocence
I once adored 
 was stripped away
behind closed doors 
 the enemy's inside my head
 but who would ever
listen to me 
 and all the secrets
that you made me keep 
 and it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 it's tearing me apart
 [HUMS]
 Where do I go from here?
 [HUMS]
 How do I face my fears?
