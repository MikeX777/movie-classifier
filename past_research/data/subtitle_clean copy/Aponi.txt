( THEME MUSIC PIANO)
Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick.
Everybody's fighting for some cause
Some belief system.
The kids on occupy wall street.
The religious Jews fighting against
against the draft in Israel.
The Muslims against the
Christians.
It all keeps us separate,
distant from ourselves.
We're all wearing
masks, and don't even realize it.
It's a natural defense
of our subconscious.
What a sad veil we all wear...
Will we ever wake up?
Take off the mask's and
realize who we really are?
Is it possible one day decades from now,
that we could share a common belief?
A purpose…
for the greater
good of the people in this city.
In this world?
What a difference that would make.
Maybe one day?
(THEME MUSIC)
- I'm Sorry miss, I didn't
mean that, are you ok?
- Yeah I'm fine sorry
it's my fault, bad habit…
I was rushing not paying
attention, but you know…
It's not a good
idea to read and walk.
I probably just
saved your life Miss!
Yes maybe you did,
maybe you saved my life.
- Well maybe I did?
- Yeah well Maybe you did?
You sound like
a Cop or something?
I'm actually a Detective.
- Really? Your joking?
- No
Well you know if you bump
into a Woman and she's in a bad mood
she might have you sued
for sexual harassment.
Now your sounding like a Lawyer?
Your joking your a
Lawyer that's too funny!
- Whats your name?
- I'm Aponi.
What a beautiful name.
I'm Jack, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you Jack,
- So Where you going to on this lovely day?
Actually headed that way
I'm going to the Actor's Studio.
- Taking classes
- That's incredible I'm going there too!
- Oh -Listen I'm going to grab a quick
coffee and I'll meet you there.
- Alright
- can I get you something coffee, tea?
- Ah... coffee?
- Regular? -Sure!
Well I want to go don't want to be late!
It's my first class.
alright..
- Sorry what was your name again?
- Jack...
- Jack... ok alright bye bye.
- Bye
(THEME MUSIC)
Ok... now for the
entire class
we're gonna work
on an intimate moment.
Every year my Aunt, my Uncle
would take us to a book store...
One day we were out swimming
and the riptide was really strong...
…um and, for the first
time I felt like I saw my
Dad who was my hero the
bravest man in the world…
I saw him get really scared.
It was a fantastic Lemonade
stand we had every summer.
We would set this up and we made
the absolute worst lemonade!
It was mostly water a little bit of
lemon and a lot of Sugar!
(CLASSMATES LAUGHING)
Great Job! We could all get some strong
visuals from the story that she told.
We could all see the
Lemonade stand and taste
it from her description,
excellent job!
Ok, who would like to be next?
Jack?
Can you go back and recall some
of your earliest memories as a child?
Im not sure I follow? I mean what
do you mean like high school,
girlfriends football? I don't
know what you mean really?
Try to tap into your emotions,
try and remember what
moved you or even inspired
you or even hurt you?
I had an ok childhood I
guess like any other kid.
We had ups and downs
and some struggles too.
What do you mean by struggles?
You were only a child?
We were pretty poor, Greg and me
we didn't give it much thought.
I mean, we had each other,
and our dog, Penny.
Our German Shepherd she was so
beautiful she went everywhere with us.
(MUSIC, CRICKETS, SOUNDS
OF NATURE)
I remember one walking back one
afternoon and Mom picked us up…
Which was unusual
she never picked us up.
Get in the car boys!
I said get in the car!
She said she wanted to go for
a ride in the Country.
We drove for about an hour
and a half.
She pulled over,
I thought we broke down.
Jack I'm just gonna take her out
ok Penny's go to do her business.
Ok boy's just ah, wait in the car,
and mommy and penny will be right back, ok.
- Penny! Penny! Penny!
- It's not a big deal Jack! Calm down!
She gave us some bullshit story
that Penny would be ok and find a new Home.
(DOG CRYING AND PANTING)
I knew that was a lie. (MOTHER
SHOOS DOG AWAY) -Go! Go!
I said get in the car!
You forgot Penny?
Ma you forgot Penny!
Please go back and get her!
Penny is going to be just fine!
(ENGINE STARTS)
Penny! Penny! Penny!
(CAR ENGINE FADING AWAY)
I ran away the next day
looking for that dog.
(THEME MUSIC)
But I never found her.
Years later my brother became ah,
rebellious.
Quit school
he started doing drugs.
That dog was
unconditional love for us.
That's all we had, something our
mother couldn't give us.
Jack, I don't know what to say?
One someone opens up such
a personal side of their life,
you can only thank them.
As actors we have to be able to tap
into these emotions from our own life.
And intertwine them with
the character that we
might be playing, we must
be this transparent.
- Nice work Jack.
- (CLASSROOM APPLAUSES)
Are you Ok?
Yeah I'm alright.
Gosh it was such an awful story
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
- Thanks
- You'll be alright.
(TAXI HORN AND STREET SOUNDS)
You know that intimate scene
took a lot out of me in class.
The teacher wants us
to tap into our emotion,
…so we can better understand everything.
I think you right about that,
I really love this class,
and I always want to be
an actor what about you?
I've always wanted
to be a Lawyer.
I went to Law school studied criminal
defense and..
But to say, I do like this class it's
giving me confidence in the court room.
- Trials and things, I love what I do it's
different from day to day a real challenge!
That's great I wish I could
say that about my career.
Why?
Well I just followed in
my Uncle's footsteps. You know being a cop.
Why don't you give me one?
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Alright… I'll have
a dry Martini shaken not stirred.
- Wow that was great! it's James Bond!
- Yes!
- Sean Connery He's the best one!
- He's totally the Best! Absolutely!
You know your quick! Let
me give you one more.
Ok!
Im an excellent driver, I'm
definitely an excellent driver.
Ah…Tim Allen?
No I'm just kidding! Just Kidding!
Alright I know this Ah, um, don't tell me!
Don't tell me -I got to have pancakes…
- Oh! -Pancakes… Dustin Hoffman!
- Yes! Um, Um…Rain Man! -Yes!
Good Job! Awesome!
Do you mind if I
ask you something?
You can ask me
anything you want.
Um, Gosh, I don't know how to say
this? Alright I'll just ask you.
Have you ever had to use your weapon?
Like, discharge it?
Yeah, I pulled my weapon out a
couple of times but,
About two months ago...
- Ended up shooting this young black kid.
- Why?
He was driving this old beat up car
it was 2am he was swerving.
It was a bad neighborhood, with drugs!
I went to the window asked for his license
and registration.
- And he wouldn't
role down the window.
So I asked him again…
License, registration?
He didn't do it.
He reaches underneath his legs,
with the glare, what it looked like…
- You thought it was a gun?
- I thought it was a gun, so I fired.
Did he live? -Oh yeah nothing
happen to him thank God!
He was in the hospital for a
couple of weeks.
Doctor's said he was lucky.
I felt terrible…
So ah, why did you want to become a lawyer?
Well I think your case is a
a perfect example.
There was a kid on the block his
name was Freddy and…
He was a great kid, he was a dork
he wasn't one of the cool kids.
He was chasing after the girls
and none of them wanted him.
But he was harmless. They always say that.
“he's harmless he would never hurt anyone.”
He wouldn't he was
a really good kid.
This woman she got assaulted a
couple of blocks from where we were.
Freddy matched the description…
…So the cops just hauled him off.
He had no attorney, he had no
money
he ended up coping a plea
even though he didn't
do it even after hours
of interrogation…
Which is another thing, I know
you have to do that..
But imagine your a sixteen year old,
Freddy was younger than that he was 13.
Imagine being 13 and a bunch of dudes
just grab you and say, ”you did this”
they stared him right in the face,
and he coped to it and went down
No-one was his voice no-one
was there for him!
Well you can be that voice.
Sometimes.
We can make
difference you and me.
- We can try.
- Yeah we can try.
(MUSIC, STREETS SOUNDS)
We have to do our lines we have to
practice our scenes.
- Yes where can we rehearse?
Well I live with
my Grandma she's real sweet.
She wouldn't mind a guest over.
Sound ok?
- Yeah that sounds great!
- Take my cell.
Ok put your number in right there.
- I wont call to late.
- No Grandma wouldn't like that!
- Ok I'll see you later.
- Alright bye.
- Bye
(LEAVES RUSTLING, WIND BLOWING)
(MUSIC RISES)
- Roll down your window!
- Roll down the window…
Put your hands up! Role it down!
License Registration!
License registration-
What are you doing!
(GUNSHOTS, DISPATCHER) “We got a sixteen
year old suspect 10-10 in progress”
Yeah I'm gonna call it a night.
Going down to
the bar to see Deluca.
Of course he's there again.
(DISPATCHER) Ok Car 1134.

(JAZZ MUSIC)
You gotta follow protocol no matter what!
Do your job and police the fucking area!
Do you understand?
I don't like what you did this morning,
we could have been written up!
A drug dealing Punk gets
shot by another dealer!
What evidence is there?
The guy that shot him is probably dead
right?
Let me do the job and collect the evidence,
We're not partners anymore get it!
I do things by the book!
You sound like a fucking rookie!
Your the big shot detective
do you work over there!
Mike stop with the
big shot shit alright!
You could have made detective too!
I'm here to have a drink

(CAR HORN, STREET SOUNDS)
(CLASSICAL BACKGROUND MUSIC )
How you doing today ladies?

You didn't see it, well your

You be quiet.
Get out of the car.
- Why you getting out of the car?
- Why are you asking me out of the car?
- This is freaking unbelievable!

Did you call that girl back? from the
other night? The one you met for drinks?
No I didn't there was no connection
at all.
You just can't get over the divorce
can you?
I'm over that chapter.
You know woman they don't need men
these days.
Look at the pot calling the kettle black

Well you know what that's all their
good for anyway!
Try making a connection, a
real connection Mike.
Jacqueline I'm gonna
email you my notes for
tonight and I'd like
them typed for tomorrow.
Sure I'll do it first thing in the morning.
Great Thanks! I've got that
Deluca Deposition tomorrow.
The judge did not grant a continuance.
That's good means my client has a shot.
She was able to record some of the assault
on her phone, so add to the fact that…
She did not consent to the search…
there was no probable cause.
Hopefully in light of all this evidence,
His attorney will make him cop to a plea.
He thinks he can hide behind
the color of law.
He can't!
So what's up bro!
Nothing, but you
have some high opinions!
(GRUNTING)You've been seen all over town
with that shine broad!
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that!
Yeah, well I'm gonna pretend your not
going out with a bitch!
You should hear yourself Mike,
you sound like a racist punk!
I'm disappointed in you!
I'm just trying to save you time
in the future and you know that Im right!
And that hurt!
Good is was supposed to!
- I'll see you next week!
- Whatever!
(STREET SOUNDS CAR HONKING)

(GUITAR MUSIC CONTINUES)
(ACOUSTIC GUITAR, TRAIN NOISE)
(SUBWAY CAR NOISE)
GRANDMA:
Tell me how old is Jack?
Well he's 44 a little older than me
but, you know just like you and Grandpa.
I know but times were different then.
Ok but it's just the same it's only
15 years not much of a difference.
Im always gonna worry about you…
I don't want to see you get hurt.
I'm a big girl and, Jack's not gonna
hurt me.
I know that he loves me and
I love him.
I love you to sweetheart.
I just want you to be happy
But I'm always gonna worry about you.
I know, I know but…
Jack's different he's caring.
You should see him he goes ever weekend
and volunteers at this youth center
The way he connects with these kids
he's dedicated.
Well no that sounds special but
you still need to be careful..
Cops do not have a good reputation
with woman.
Jack's not like that he's not
like those other cops.
When I'm with him
it's like being on cloud nine.
You know like the sun is always shining.
You sound like me when
I use to speak about your Grandfather.
I miss him so much not a day goes by I
don't think about him, what we shared..
When he past away a big part of me died
too, we have a love that will never end.
I pray you will find someone that will take
care of you like that.
Now if the universe has brought you two
together cherish every moment.
Alright…
How much money does the man make?
Grandma! That's got nothing
to do with anything.
- Yes it does -Oh my God…
don't give me that face…
- Come on -Alright I have to go
But… I will say I think Jack's the one.

new relationship that's intense.
Do you have his correct information?
Do you know someone who does?
I do actually.
You do?
- Yeah I have all his information -Ok
- Haven't brought myself to do anything?
Why?
Its been so long I'm so much older now

Speaking of…we actually should get started!
Because we don't want to run late.

Yeah but why don't we try to
do it off book? To see how we do?
- Ok -Ok -Alright (LAUGHTER)
So how you gonna play Blanch?
She's such a strong character,
she is quite vulnerable.
Can you play vulnerable?
Yes, but stop it, be serious
I wanna do well in this class..
I'm sorry I couldn't resist..
Well I think she's a gutsy woman.
But really it's more nuance than that.
She's still a little
bit helpless.
She's has to be more, more like her.
That's my mom.
- That's your mom?
- Yeah
- I can see the resemblance.
Yeah, she's probably the strongest woman
that ever lived.
I'm sorry what was I saying..
- Blanch
- Blanch that's right
Blanch needs to be that way.
Wanna know why?
Because Stanley is not a push over..
No Stanley is the king of the castle.
Until Blanch shows up.
- Like a wrecking ball.
But I think they're
attracted to one another.
- Oh you think.. -Yes
I do -are you sure?
- (OTHER ROOM) are you

She's really special woman.
She's a very special woman Jack.
And I'm very protective of her.
I mean I never made a connection before

I wanna ask her to marry me.
You've been married

What Aponi and I have, doesn't

You sure this is what you want?
I can't picture myself without her.
How does Aponi feel about this?
Have you spoken to her about this at all?
Yeah we have and we both want

To have your blessing would

We're getting serious I think I'm going

You gotta be kidding me?
You wanna marry this chick?

What happen to you, your not the same guy

Your upset because I

Oh black people, thanks

Imagine someone you love, Imagine they
get beating up real bad…

I'm sorry about that,
but I get it they were
black, this hatred has
festered inside of you.
Remember that kid I shot, that black kid?
Well his Mom came to the hospital and she
forgave me, she understood…
but these are people man,
you understand people?
Just like you and me Im in love with Aponi!
Why is that so hard to understand?
8 million people in this city and you
have to pick that girl?
The universe picked us ok!
Leave me alone, You, your girlfriend
and your righteous bullshit!
- I'm gonna wish you luck! -Yeah,
alright… -I've had enough!
(CITY TRAFFIC)
Grandma are you still asleep?
Grandma? I made you some coffee…
I can make tea if you want?
Grandma, I probably gonna be late tonight.
One of the attorney's called
in sick I'm gonna have to
do a couple of more hours
at the office if that's ok?
I can pick something up for us later,
what about Chinese?
(SOFT MUSIC)
Ok time to get up, time for breakfast…
I got some coffee I know you
like that, what about some tea?
I can make you tea if you want?
(SOFT MUSIC) Or…I can make you
an omelette, you like that…
Grandma? Its Hot.
Grandma?
(SOFT MUSIC)
I wont disturb you.
I can make you those eggs? Do you remember?
Do you remember when I was little
You would teach me how to cook, the first
thing you taught me was how to me eggs…
First you should crack them
you should always use a fork,
cause if you use the side of the
pan the shell might get in.
Get a little bit of milk, then add the
basil in…
(WEEPING)
But only in the end so it infuses.
Do you remember?
Maybe you want a bagel, remember we use
to go down to that bagel shop?
The one on twelfth, with Sal,
you remember that?
He always… had that
stupid grin on his face…
(SNIFFLES)
You don't have to get up Grandma…
She was such a Joy and inspiration
in all of our lives.
And I remember once it must have been
early spring?
And we were walking to school and walking
through the park, that gnats were out
It was slightly humid, and something
just flew by me really quickly
and I asked Grammy what's that, she's says…
She says… it's a Rhopalocera
and I said, what's a Rhopalocera?
She said it means Butterfly…
She said it was her favorite
because it reminded her of me.
Because in Native American my name
means Butterfly.
She told me you can learn
a lot from a butterfly,
you can watch them
they're so graceful…
their beauty and ever changing ways
you should try to be like them.
As I got older I finally
realized what she meant.
I mean first butterflies
don't live that long.
Really it's the fact that in order to be
happy in life you've got to be graceful,
you got to always adapt cause you don't
what life is gonna give you.
She's very wise my Grammy
She'll always be in my heart.
Ok, why don't we sit down
and eat, let's rejoice,
celebrate her life that's
the way she would want it.
- So how long were they married?
- I guess
about forty five years
- forty five years…wow…
- You can see the love - Yeah he was
devoted to her, and she to him as well
- You look so much like her -You think so?
- Yeah I do look
- She ah, went to walk the dog
in the snow, -two dogs -She loved that dog.
The thing about Grammy is she's kind
of a Grammy to everyone around her.
Yeah
- Remember the time we went to the Theatre?
- Yeah
She was worried I was really
cold, she gave me her blanket
Actually you know what she loved
doing, she loved ah showing
pictures to everybody, It
didn't matter who you were
Show you pictures and pictures,
she had all the albums
Oh… you know what there's a good one good I
had it blown up.
Actually there's one on the
desk in the other room.
Would you mind getting it for me?
I'd like to show every one.
It's just right there when you walk in,
Oh she had them everywhere remember the old
albums the one's when you stick them on.
Aponi… it's the room
right on the right here?
- Yeah ah right there on the right?
- Ok

 I'm the one…
 Who will always believe
 Wear my heart on my sleeve for you
 I'm the one who's learn how to wait.
 For the time when you say you want me too

 I'll do anything you want me to do
 I'm your sure thing I'll do anything
 And it don't bother me
 If it don't mean anything to you.
