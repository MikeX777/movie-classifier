       - [Voiceover] Eh!
     That's a gun asshole.
      What the fuck are
      you doing here, huh?
 This can't be no coincidence.
         Who sent you?
         Who sent you?
    Nobody in this town
    crosses Lorenzo, no one.
       You're a dead man!
           (gunshot)
           (gunshot)
           (grunting)
    (tense orchestral music)
             - Hey!
              Hey!
              Hey!
           You, you!
         Motherfucker!
       (tires squealing)
    (tense orchestral music)
       (engine rumbling)
    (ominous ambient music)
      (cell phone ringing)
            - Hello?
         - [Thief] Roy?
      - Jimmy, what's up?
       - Things went bad
       man, really bad.
         - Hey hold on.
      What happened, now
      do you have the car?
      - Yea I got the car,
      but what the fuck
      did you get me into?
    - Hey, now take it easy.
  Now, tell me what happened.
 - I did exactly what you said!
 I was there within the window.
 And then some guys show's up,
  puts a gun in my face, and
  you guaranteed me that time!
      - But you got away?
 - Yea I got away but I had
 to stab the dude in the neck!
   I boost cars, I don't stab
   motherfuckers in the neck!
      - Okay, now listen.
        We can fix this.
    But, you got to bring
    the car to the location.
      I'll meet you there.
        - Who's Lorenzo?
    (ominous ambient music)
  - How do you know that name?
          - Who is he?
    Roy, you fucked me man!
   - Now Jimmy, you knew this
   was going to be risky.
         Now trust me.
     You don't want to fuck
     with these people.
       If you bring us
       the car right now,
        I can fix this.
          - Fuck you!
           Who's us?
      You fucked me man,
      you knew those guys
    were going to be there.
         You set me up!
   - Think about this Jimmy.
      This is going to be
      the most important
       move of your life.
  It's bad enough you have one
  gangster out to kill you.
             Jimmy.
             Jimmy!
         (phone beeps)
    (dramatic ambient music)
    (ominous ambient music)
             (bang)
   (upbeat synthesizer music)
         (engine roars)
       (heavy breathing)
  - Detroit's a single mother
    living in a trailer park
    with a baby on her hip.
      And L.A.'s a porn
      star with fake tits,
       deep pockets, and
       a coke problem.
    Everybody comes out
    here to find something.
  Or run away from something.
        I'm doing both.
      Figured it was my
      environment that was
      making me who I was.
When you fuck around like this,
      doesn't matter what
      city you live in.
        Sooner of later,
things are bound to get bloody.
        Rule number one.
    Stay away from cars less
    than five years old.
       I usually go for
       Toyotas or Hondas.
The Japs know how to make cars.
       Rule number two,
       stay away from any
  high-end luxury sports cars,
      Mercedes, BMW, Audi.
        Sure, the payout
        might be higher,
    but then so is the risk.
       Rule number three.
     Mental focus, it's
     all about the breath.
 (steady deliberate breathing)
    Keeping your head
    clear, and being present
is of paramount importance when
     a boost is going down.
    I started this when I
    was young and desperate
      and bored, but I
      had a talent for it.
    On my best days, I would
    say it's a calling.
   Not like the other
   fuckos who joyride around
         and abuse it.
     And yes, if you aren't
     a moron, being a thief
      ain't so dangerous.
    But this is my practice,
    this is my discipline.
     Rule number four,
     perception is reality.
   You'd be amazing with
   what you can get away with
if you look like you're working.
       But I am working.
    Rule number five, you
    pick the day in advance,
        but not the car.
    Picking the car is
    like deciding if you're
      going to go talk to
      a girl at the bar.
It's a frequency you tune into.
You can call it a gut instinct,
 for me, it's been like a
 wave at the back of my spine.
      And I don't know if
      it's the excitement
       of the unknown,
       or the adrenaline,
     but it's never wrong.
    I guess deep down, it's
    the part I like best.
     I've stolen 336 cars
     in the last 10 years,
and this whooptie maked it 337.
   Rule six, you never
   trust anyone in the game.
             Ever.
      And one last thing,
    always know your price.
    My name is Jimmy Greco.
     And this is the story
     of the day I died.
        (dramatic bass)
      (gentle piano music)
       (knocking on door)
         Good morning.
        - Good morning.
          - Surprise.
      - [Girl] Do all guys
      from the East Coast
     put it down like you?
- [Jimmy] I'm from Detroit baby.
           (laughter)
       - That's basically
       the East Coast.
     - [Jimmy] Not really.
 - Well it's closer to New
 York than it is to California.
            - True.
           (laughter)
      But the answer's no.
           - No what?
   - [Jimmy] No, not all guys
   from the East are like me.
    Want to know the reason
    it feels so good?
             - Why?
      - 'Cause I love you.
        - Careful Jimmy.
     - You're the one that
     needs to be careful.
I'm fine expressing my emotions.
     I know what it means.
       - Is that a fact?
    - I could die tomorrow,
    and then what?
      Think any of this
      is going to matter?
        We're dust baby.
  - We're not just dust Jimmy.
      We're human beings.
      - But it's our human
      minds that assign
     meaning to our lives.
  I fucking love you, so what?
       What are you going
       to do about it?
        - How romantic.
  I'll think about that while
  I make your breakfast.
- Brew the coffee strong please.
    (ominous ambient music)
   - I know how you like it.
        (distorted bass)
       - [Voiceover] Shit
       is fucking good!
- [Voiceover] Yea, it's not bad.
     - [Voiceover] Not bad?
 It's way better then anything
 else out there right now.
       - [Voiceover] So?
    Doesn't make it amazing
    just 'cause it's better
       than all the other
       shit out there.
    - Babe, this negativity
    is really off putting.
     I mean yea, we finally
     get some good shit,
     and you're over there.
 I totally forgot this fucking
 monkey was sitting here.
         What's up man?
    Hmm, you got the money?
     Maybe I'll just bleed
     you out instead.
      - It's okay Gevorg.
       Baby, nobody's
       getting cut today.
   Too messy, I'm in no mood.
            - Fine.
      Why the fuck are you
      still sitting here?
    (ominous ambient music)
         - [Roy] Hola!
    - Yo, what the fuck man?
         - Como estas?
     - [Boy] Yo, I told you
     not to come out here
   without calling me first.
           (laughter)
     - Hey you think I
     give a shit about your
       chavalos and your
       powder pushing?
  - Do all you fucking beaners
  got maize in your ears?
    Or is it just you, huh?
       - Let me tell you
       something, loco.
      You keep pushing me,
      you're not going to
      like what happens.
    - Fuck you going to do?
  - How about, I call some of
  my cartel boys down here,
   to rape your little slut,
     gouge your eyes out,
     watch you peck around
 like a fucking blind chicken.
        (pecking noises)
Hey, come on, lighten up, loco!
     Shit, I called you, I
     left a message, read?
   You never got back to me.
 So I came down here in person,
    to discuss some
    time-sensitive business.
- Fucking blow got me all jumpy.
           (laughter)
   What the fuck do you want?
         Make it quick.
    - How would you like to
    expand your business?
- Well you know I would love to,
   but Lorenzo runs the show.
    I'm already at
    capacity, in accordance
      with our agreement.
            (snorts)
   - [Roy] What if Lorenzo's
   not around anymore?
      - What if, what if?
            What if?
     - Some shit's getting
     ready to go down.
        - I'm listening.
       - The question is,
       how much would you
       be willing to pay
       to get in on it?
             - Huh.
     Since you seem to be
     the man with the plan,
       why don't you save
       us both the time
    and let me know how much
    it's going to cost me?
        - I'm not sure.
      I'm going to have to
      talk to my best guy.
      And then double it.
- Yea, why do we need the best?
      - Word is, Lorenzo's
      dying, amigo.
       He needs a kidney.
  - Yea, how do you know this?
    - Because birdies
    talk, and birdies sing.
           (laughter)
       And then Big Tommy
       pays me a visit.
    (ominous ambient music)
        Yea, well well.
     - Don't start with
     me bro, I'd prefer to
     make this as painless
     as possible, alright?
 - Good to see you old friend.
      - We're not friends
      anymore, are we Roy?
       - Well, since your
       little accident.
  - I'm here to talk business.
         - Okay, well,
    how about a little drink
    for old time's sake?
             - No.
       I need you to move
       something for me.
     - You know what they
     say about forgiveness?
      To forgive is to
      set a prisoner free.
      Then you find you
      that prisoner's you.
     - It's time sensitive.
    And extremely valuable,
    and that's why
         I came to you.
    - He wants me to courier
    a package from Mexico.
    Tells me that there's a
    kidney inside that box.
  - Yea, makes sense I guess.
Nobody's seen Lorenzo in months.
       - Big Tommy was
       very, very serious
     about the time frame.
 - Won't they know it was you?
       - They'll suspect.
    With all the
    connections I got, I got
      diplomatic immunity.
     - And what if they
     come after you anyway?
 - You let me worry about that.
    Lorenzo's got way too
    many enemies down south.
 - And little birdie's do talk.
     - [Jimmy] When you're
     alone, it's hard
       to be present with
       your thoughts.
      And that's our
      innate fear of death
    manifesting around the
    things we can't control.
           - No, man.
 It's 'cause I've got regrets.
- But you can't change the past.
   - Yea, but at least if
   I'm going to get clipped,
      I know it's going to
      fucking happen fast.
  What I'm most terrified of,
      is the thought of a
      slow painful death,
      not actually dying.
  Especially after what I saw
  my dad go through, you know?
      - God rest his soul.
             - Yep.
      Cheers to that, man.
    (dramatic ambient music)
       What's up with
       the lotus ink bro?
  - Take the boy out the hood.
    - Is that a gang tattoo?
  - No man, we just got pride
  from where we're from.
     Those guys had my
     back and I had theirs.
    We weren't a gang in the
    traditional sense, but
    we protected each other.
   - So why'd you leave, man?
          - Honestly?
           Too cold.
           (laughter)
           - Uh huh.
So is that really why you left?
          The weather?
   - Me and my boys got in a
   fight outside The Derby.
     One of them got shot.
   Did you know Rick McKeeum?
          - Nah, man.
   - After that, things
   just kind of slowed down.
       Felt like I was
       waiting around for
    something bad to happen.
  Figured if I came out here,
give me a chance to start fresh.
- How's it working out for you?
        - It's working.
       'Cause I'm sitting
       here, with Clyde,
       drinking beers
       and getting a tan.
    (dramatic ambient music)
What about you, why'd you leave?
       - Do you remember
       Mike, my cousin?
  - [Jimmy] I never knew him,
  I remember he got killed.
      - Yea, well after...
   My father died, and Mike,
   I kind of realized I was
   going down the wrong path.
   - [Jimmy] I'm sorry, I
   know you guys were close.
   - I wasn't ever really
   that close to my dad, man.
         Not like you.
    (dramatic ambient music)
 - I was talking about Michael.
        - Right, right.
    (dramatic ambient music)
       (engine rumbling)
            - Jimmy!
          - Mr. Slick!
    - Come on to the office.
 - Nah man, I got to get going.
       I just got to go.
     - I got some tequila,
     and I want to
  talk to you anyway, come on.
  (Tejano music over intercom)
       - There's an extra
       1,000 bucks here.
    - I thought you
    deserved a little bonus.
      - [Jimmy] No thanks.
    - Jimmy, don't be rude.
- I don't mean to be rude, but I
    like our arrangement
    just fine the way it is.
     And I know what it
     means if I take that.
 - What are you talking about?
   - It means I work for you.
   - And what do you do now?
   - Now I work with you,
   there's a big difference.
         - How's that?
           - Simple.
       I bring you cars
       for $2,500 a pop.
 And you know as well as I do,
   I can go anywhere in town
   and get that same price.
  What makes us special, is
  that we're both consistent.
           (laughter)
       - Is that a fact?
    - [Jimmy] Damn straight.
          - You know?
      This tequila's
      made from a cactus.
Meant to be sipped, and enjoyed.
      To power and money.
           (laughter)
 You know, but sometimes Jimmy,
you got to just say, "fuck it."
    (ominous ambient music)
    - What's this about Roy?
 - I got a special job for you.
   - I don't do special jobs.
   - Not even for big money?
     - How much we talking?
          - 20 grand.
     - I just told you I
     don't do special jobs.
           - 50 then.
    - You're just going to
    throw numbers at me now?
      - Yea, I'm serious.
       - Well then again,
       respectfully Roy,
 I'm going to have to decline.
        - Well how about
        a respectable...
           100 grand?
- [Jimmy] Thanks for the drink.
    (ominous ambient music)
          - 200 grand.
    (ominous ambient music)
Ah, now I've got your attention.
       - Are you serious?
  - I don't fuck around Jimmy.
    (ominous ambient music)
 - What kind of job we talking?
     - Just another boost.
      You got five minutes
      to steal a car,
     containing some
     really valuable cargo.
       It's going down
       in broad daylight.
       All you got to do,
       bring me the car.
    Don't ask any questions,
    and that's it.
          - That's it?
       - Yep, that's it.
    (ominous ambient music)
          - Two fifty.
    - I got to make a call.
          - What for?
    - Now I know your price.
         (static hiss)
    (ominous ambient music)
       - Tommy, you mind?
    (ominous ambient music)
       You know who I am?
     - You must be Lorenzo.
 But you don't look sick to me.
   - That's because I'm not.
   At least not in the body.
       Maybe in the mind.
  - I thought this was all
  about you needing a kidney.
    - What's your name kid?
            - Jimmy.
    - What do you do Jimmy?
       What's your thing?
        - I boost cars.
     - And how did you wind
     up working for Austin?
   - I don't work for nobody.
    - And yet, here we are.
    (ominous ambient music)
     It's amazing isn't it?
      How crystal clear
      a situation becomes
     when you're looking at
     it from the outside?
       - It's a matter
       of point of view.
           - Exactly.
         We're animals.
 That's part of our conundrum.
      Greed serves us
      very well in nature,
    but in the human world,
    we have our intellect
     to tell us otherwise.
  - If you were me, you would
  have done the same thing.
         - Hard to say.
  (ominous heart beat effect)
    (ominous ambient music)
       You know I have to
       kill you, right?
    (ominous ambient music)
- You don't have to do anything.
  - I didn't get to be in this
  position by being merciful.
            - Mercy?
       Is that what we're
       talking about?
 - If you were in my position,
    you'd do the same thing.
         - Hard to say.
     - How old are you kid?
             - 26.
            - Jesus.
       When I was 26, I
       lived in Chelsea.
     - Why'd you come here?
      - Because I knew
      that I would have to
       burn some people
       if I wanted to get
     where I wanted to go.
    Or, move somewhere else,
    and take what was mine.
      I chose the latter.
  - Makes sense, but why L.A.?
    It's the weather, right?
     I'm from Detroit, you
     ever been to Midwest?
       It's fucking cold.
  - First I went to New York.
 But the Guineas run that town.
          Also, cold.
      After a few years,
      I came out to L.A.,
       and I knew right
       away, I'd hit it.
       - How'd you know?
      - Back then, my
      main thing was blow,
     and this bitch ran all
     the coke from Mexico.
 Ruthless cunt named Graciela.
  Bat shit crazy, that broad.
       And good looking
       too, huge titties.
    But if she even thought
    you'd crossed her,
   she'd have you burned
   alive, cut out your eyes,
    and chop off your dick.
      That's the funny
      thing about people,
    you can deify them, but
    that the end of the day,
      their flesh is just
      as soft and fragile
       as a baby girl's.
 - Something tells me things
 didn't end well for Graciela.
- She fell victim to her vanity.
       And then I put a
       gun under her chin
 and blew her fucking head off.
      Men get a bad wrap,
      but it never ceases
     to surprise me, how
     stupid a woman becomes
   when she sees a big dick.
      Just like that, pow,
      no more Graciela,
      and I'm running the
      coke from Mexico.
      You think the
      wetbacks give a fuck
    who's running the shit?
   They don't, trust me, as
   long as you're consistent.
   (tense synthesizer music)
     You ever been in love?
            - What?
    - You ever been in love?
         - Sure I have.
      - Tell me about it.
   (tense synthesizer music)
 - First time was Sarah Madson.
      She was a couple of
      years older than me.
    She lived up the street.
  When I was 16, we hooked up.
   Spent the summer together.
Used to pick her up in my truck,
    and we'd sleep under
    that stars at this lake
       near my home town.
      - Was she beautiful?
             - Yea.
        - So that's it?
          Just Sarah?
     - And my girl Sherry.
           - Sherry?
    - Yea, my girl Shereen.
      - Tell me about her.
       - She's different.
         She's special.
   (tense synthesizer music)
     I can't figure it out.
  She never asks me for much.
 She maintains this, distance.
       I tell her I love
       her all the time
   'cause honestly I do, but.
    (dramatic ambient music)
          - But what?
   - I don't know, nothing
   man, it's hard to explain.
    What do you care anyway?
      - All my life, I've
      spent avoiding love.
   I've had a few meaningful
   relationships, but
    when it comes to women,
      friends, family, in
      our line of work,
   it's best to keep it lean.
      Loved ones become...
       Like blind spots.
   I have a daughter, Jimmy.
            Sierra.
          She's seven.
    Never loved her
    mother, but, the moment
 I laid eyes on my little girl,
       my world flipped.
      Except for Tommy,
      I kept her a secret
  from my entire organization.
The only reason I'm telling you,
     is that she's the one
     who's dying, not me.
      And I need your help
      to save her life.
      - This whole thing's
      about a little girl?
       A little girl, and
       a blood disease.
      It's ironic really.
  All the energy I expended
  trying to keep her a secret,
    and now, apparently,
    it's the very same thing
      that's brought us
      to this unfortunate
     and somewhat
     impossible situation.
    (ominous ambient music)
  - Why should I believe you?
     - You said it
     yourself, look at me.
   I'm as healthy as a horse.
     Now I'm going to
     level with you Jimmy.
     Because we're running
     fucking short on time,
       and we could chat
       here all night.
 Even if the kidney is intact,
    she still has only a
    70% chance of it taking.
      I'm not going to
      sit here and make up
  some elaborate lie about how
       if you help me, I
       will let you go.
     You fucked me, Jimmy.
 And I know you didn't mean it,
     but you did it anyway.
       And now you have
       to pay the price.
  So, this is going to go down
    one of either two ways.
       One, you're going
       to tell me where
       the kidney is, and
       when I have it,
      Tommy here, is going
      to put a bullet
      through your heart.
       Or, you don't tell
       me where it is,
      and I have one of my
      less civilized guys
       go to work on you.
   (tense synthesizer music)
       - What if I set
       everything right?
 - Jimmy, I have my reputation.
        - So that's it?
          - That's it.
   (tense synthesizer music)
    (ominous ambient music)
   - Although I myself am not
   a violent man, Lorenzo,
 I understand people like you.
 So before I agree to anything,
       here are my terms.
       I need two things.
              One,
          I want 150K.
      For my girl Shereen.
Put her brother through college,
 take care of her for a while.
            And two,
      you got to let me go
      for a couple hours.
   I'll bring you back the
   kidney, that's a promise.
     But I need some time.
       - You know I can't
       do that Jimmy.
      - Just hear me out.
   Like I said, I understand
   people like you.
   I know that you'll find
   the thing that I love most
      and destroy it if I
      try to skip town or
      do anything stupid.
       And I don't value
       my life that much,
         I never have.
    But just so we're clear,
    I'm not asking you.
        I'm telling you.
     I need a little time.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
  - Jimmy, what the fuck man?
- I need your help, I'm in deep.
         - This is bad.
      This is really bad.
           - I know.
  I got caught up in this
  shit and it's all fucked up.
          - What shit?
     Buy, sell organs on
     the black market shit?
 - No, it's not my thing, it's.
   - Then what is your thing?
        - I boost cars!
   - I always knew you were
   into some shady shit man,
      but this is serious.
           - I know!
      - That kidney
      belongs to somebody
    and they're going to die
    if they don't get it.
           - I know.
     - Then what the fuck?
    - I was hired to steal
    this car for big money.
       I didn't know it
       was in the trunk,
    I knew it was valuable,
    I figured it was drugs.
             - And?
     - And during the boost
     some guy shows up
    and puts a gun in my
    face and I stab him man,
     I stab him in the neck
     with a screwdriver.
   - Wait, wait, wait, wait,
       you stabbed a guy?
     - It was self defense!
    (dramatic string music)
 - Look, Jimmy, that's murder.
     - What are you doing?
        - I'm a cop man.
 I know that we got a history,
   but I got to take you in.
         - Take me in?
      I called you 'cause
      I need you help!
 - Put your hands on your head.
  - Are you serious right now?
   Friendship, loyalty, does
   that mean anything to you?
   We're practically family!
        - I know Jimmy.
      But I'm not one of
      your lotus brothers
    and I certainly won't be
    an accessory to murder.
       Now put your hands
       behind your head!
             - No.
           (gunshot)
  (dramatic orchestral music)
            Come on.
   You made me do it man, I'm
   not going to shoot you.
      I called you 'cause
      I need your help
   and no one in this fucking
   town's got my back.
  These guys want to kill me,
  bad guys want to kill me.
   So you can either help me
   survive the next 24 hours,
       and be part of the
       solution, or not,
  and then you're just
  another part of the problem.
     - Jimmy I'm a cop man.
  This could cost me my badge.
       This is my career.
- Then forget I ever called you.
 - [Clyde] Jimmy I'm sorry man.
       - Fuck you Clyde.
     (somber string music)
        (engine rumbles)
         - Jimmy wait!
(suspenseful synthesizer music)
            - Boys!
- [Tommy] Shut the fuck up Roy.
             (thud)
        (distorted bass)
              Roy?
              Roy?
              Roy?
          - The fuck?
      - Roy listen to me.
   One of my guys got
   stabbed in the neck today,
      with a screwdriver,
      during your pickup.
    - You mean your pickup!
          (Roy yells)
     - Listen, our personal
     stuff aside Roy,
    I trusted you again
    and you have fucked me.
   So you got about 30
   seconds to start talking,
   or I am going to make
   your life miserable, huh?
    - I don't know anything!
           - Sledge.
             (thud)
           (coughing)
     You like to talk Roy,
     everybody in town
     knows that you like to
     talk, so talk to me.
              Huh?
     - Hey, I don't know
     what you're talking--
      - Goddammit I don't
      get people like you!
       You know what, you
       just keep digging
    deeper and deeper right?
      You just won't look,
         grab his hand.
             (thud)
  You know what infuriates me?
 Is that think you're so smart,
      but you're not Roy,
      and on top of that,
  you're a horrible liar, so
  all that ends up happening,
    is you waste important
    people's valuable time,
with all of your bullshit, huh?
     - [Roy] Wait, wait,
     wait, what's he doing?
      - [Tommy] Every
      time you lie to me,
      I'm going to rip out
      one of your fucking
       fingernails, okay?
       So start talking!
      - Okay I'll tell you
      everything I know!
       Wait, wait, wait!
  Okay, I'll tell you, I'll
  tell you everything I know.
     Okay, word is, this
     coked up kid, Austin.
He found out about the package.
      He must have thought
      that it was like,
    a load of blow, because
    that's his deal.
 Hey, hey, he lives in Vernon.
  - I know who Austin is Roy.
     But what that doesn't
     account for is how
 Austin knew about the package,
      unless you told him!
      - I swear to God, I
      didn't say a thing!
    He deals to the
    Armenians, and he knows
 all the real border borthers!
      They must have
      fond out something!
     I didn't say a thing.
    (ominous ambient music)
            I swear.
  - That is a great story Roy.
     That is a great story.
           You know?
 I guess a half truth is better
 than no truth at all, so.
    I'm going to pay you for
    that info, thank you.
   But you still owe me one.
          (screaming)
     I'm going to call you.
 Get your money for you, okay?
    (ominous ambient music)
         - God damnit!
- Listen, I'm going to need you
to start from the beginning.
         I'm all ears.
    But if you want my help,
I need to know everything, okay?
 - I don't know where to begin.
   - What about the guy that
   put a gun up to your head
      in the parking lot?
      Did he say anything?
       - He asked me who
       I was working for.
     He mentioned Lorenzo.
      - He said "Lorenzo?"
            Oh shit.
     He must be talking
     about Lorenzo Champs.
         - Who's that?
  - He's a big time gangster.
    Runs a lot of operations
    in and out of L.A.
      He's our west
      coast kingpin, man.
 You know, we've been trying to
 nail him down for years, but.
          - But what?
       - He's good Jimmy.
        He's real good.
     All of his businesses
     are legit now.
      Except for the coke.
       - So what's he
       want a kidney for?
        - Who knows man?
      People pay a lot of
      money for the shit.
     - I just keep thinking
     about that guy
    in the parking lot man.
    I didn't have a choice,
    you got to believe me.
      - Oh I believe you.
   Now I need you to tell me
       exactly what it is
    that you want me to do.
       (seagulls calling)
    (ominous droning music)
      - You must be Jimmy.
     Come on in, have seat.
    (ominous droning music)
      You don't need that
      pistol, cowboy.
  - I'll be the judge of that.
   - We're on the same side.
      So where's this box?
   I want to see this thing.
        - It ain't far.
       Where's my money?
  - You'll get your money when
  you deliver the package.
     So if there's someone
     you need to call,
   now would be a good time.
      - No, we'll wait
      'till Roy gets here,
     then I make that call,
     and I decide how this
   is going to work together.
         - Okie dokie.
    I'm Crystal by the way.
       Your services are
       much appreciated.
 Roy spoke very highly of you.
         - That a fact?
       - So you thirsty?
   Care for a tasty beverage?
        Or maybe a bump?
     - No thanks, I had a
     pretty rough morning.
   - Yea, I heard about that.
             Sorry.
     Could you please stop
     pointing that at me?
     I'm a girl, it's rude.
        (lighter clicks)
        - [Jimmy] So how
        do you know Roy?
      Everyone knows Roy.
      - Wasn't he supposed
      to be here by now?
  - Dude, relax, you're tense.
  You're kind of cute though.
        Where you from?
           - Detroit.
     - Yea, I can see that.
   You kind of got that whole
 trashy urban guy thing going.
     - Yea, where you from?
          - The Hills.
      Oh, do you want one?
        (dramatic bass)
      Mellow the fuck out!
       You just made a
       shit ton of money,
     and as soon as you
     deliver your package,
all's going to end well for you.
     How about that drink?
      - I don't like this,
      you're stalling!
          - Excuse me?
  - Where's my fucking money?
    - I don't like your
    tone Jimmy from Detroit.
      - Well I almost
      got killed earlier,
     so don't really give
     a shit what you think.
 Now where's my fucking money?
       - Alright, you
       left me no choice.
 - [Jimmy] What are you doing?
      - Helping you relax.
  (sensual synthesizer music)
           (laughter)
      You really are new
      at this, aren't you?
     Now take one more
     step, and I'll shoot.
             Baby!
     You can come out now!
  (sensual synthesizer music)
          (whistling)
        (knife clicking)
      (tense string music)
       - [Lorenzo] What?
           - Nothing.
- Have a soft spot for the kid?
       - Yea, I guess so.
     (gentle string music)
  - What was I supposed to do?
          Let him go?
      - No, I don't know.
     It just, this doesn't
     feel right, you know?
    - [Lorenzo] It happens.
     - Yea, but not like
     this, and when the kid
  did the right thing Lorenzo.
      - Maybe in the end,
      he got mixed up with
      the wrong people.
  Roy, that weirdo coke head.
           - Austin.
   - Nobody with half a brain
   would work for that guy.
    - Yea, I don't think he
    was working with Austin.
     I mean, Roy maybe, but
     he didn't know Austin
     from a hole in the
     wall, I mean that guy
    was cutting his face up
    when we went in there.
         (static hiss)
   (ominous bass percussion)
    - [Tommy] Jesus Christ.
          - It's you.
  - [Tommy] What the fuck is
  the matter with you Austin?
     - Are you really going
     to lecture me old man?
   - Look, what's up with
   the sense of entitlement?
              Huh?
       I mean, didn't we
       talk about this?
One day I'm going to be too old
     and too tired to deal
     with this bullshit?
     And then it was going
     to be Austin's time.
      Right, but you
      couldn't wait, huh?
       You just insist on
       disrespecting me
 over and over and over again.
      - Disrespecting you?
      I'm just trying to
      expand my business.
    If you were in my shoes,
    you would be doing
     the exact same thing.
         - Fair enough.
However, if I want someone dead,
     I get them dead, and
     I make damn well sure
   they know it was me, that
   wanted them that way.
    You idiots, you get
    involved in shit without
any concept of cause and effect.
         - Wow, you...
    Do realize we're talking
    about drug trafficking?
   Transporting human organs
   on the black market
          and murder?
 This isn't Sicily circa 1940.
  We're not in The Godfather.
  Some stupid gangster movie.
  Okay, I saw an opportunity.
       It's that simple.
 And when Lorenzo's body is
 drained and cold in the Earth,
    no one is going to gove
    a shit how it happened.
    (ominous ambient music)
     - [Tommy] I guess you
     didn't see all the
       guys in nice suits
       with huge guns.
             Okay.
I'm going to explain it to you.
      There's a gulf here,
      there's a divide.
  A great divide, if you will.
     On the one side you
     got classy gentlemen,
     that get nice
     things, cars, houses.
       Beautiful women,
       big bank accounts.
         Fillet Mignon.
    Manicured lawns, and we
    get to have those things
        because well, we
        live by a creed.
  A sense of civility, right?
     And then on the other
     side, there's you.
     You're a fuck up, man.
      You're a psychopath.
    You make bad decisions,
    both personally,
     and businesswise, that
     affect other people.
     You have no reverence
     for the game
    and you played it wrong.
   You're lost in the woods
   without a compass Austin,
      and do you know
      where that gets you?
       - Lorenzo doesn't
       have the kidney.
    Okay, and time's
    running out, right, huh?
      Jimmy here is
      working with a cop.
      And he's the one who
      has the package, so.
        - Is that right?
        - That's right.
            Ask him.
  - [Tommy] Is that true kid?
       - You really going
       to shoot me Tommy?
      Wouldn't Lorenzo
      rather whack the guy
       who sold him out?
  That would make sense to me.
    (ominous ambient music)
    - Austin, you are a
    tragic character in this
    play of fools, brother.
         - How's that?
 - Because you played it wrong.
         - Killing me,
   would be bad for business.
    I move too much product.
         - That's true.
      However, that's why
      these guys are here.
    (ominous ambient music)
            Sledge.
    (ominous ambient music)
           - No, no!
              No!
   You don't have to do this!
           Tommy, no!
             Baby!
              No!
           (screams)
    (ominous ambient music)
   - You were just too eager.
    (ominous ambient music)
            (crack)
        (Austin gagging)
    Will you untie the kid?
Let's get the fuck out of here.
    (ominous ambient music)
     - So, no more Austin.
     - Yea, good riddance.
   Wish I'd taken care of the
   whacko a long time ago.
 - These things play out Tommy,
   that's just the way it is.
       - No, I know, but
       I don't like it.
      I mean Roy's the one
      that made this mess.
  - He wanted the guy whacked,
   just think of this as part
   of the payment process.
   - But even if that's true,
     what, we're just happy
     to have the Armenians
      do Roy's dirty work?
     - Doesn't matter now.
      - Alright, so let me
      get this straight.
Even thought you and I both know
       that it was Roy
       that sold us out,
      you're not thinking
      what I'm thinking?
          - No Tommy.
  You know we can't touch him.
      This'll blow the lid
      off the whole thing.
Got a lot of things on my mind,
     the last thing I need
     is some bigger problem
      south of the border.
           - Come on.
       - This isn't open
       for discussion!
           - Alright.
        How's she doing?
          - We'll see.

     (somber string music)
           (banging)
     (somber string music)
            - Jimmy.
     What the fuck happened
     to your face man?
         - Where is it?
 - [Clyde] It's in the kitchen.
    - if I'm not back later,
    you need to give this to
    my girl Shereen, okay?
      Here's her address.
       Promise me you'll
       give it to her!
            - Jesus.
         - Promise me!
       - Jesus, I promise
       man, I promise!

       (engine rumbling)
    (ominous ambient music)
          (gun cocks)
           (gunshot)
      - Take care of this.
    (ominous ambient music)
      (gentle piano music)
        (puppies crying)
- [Jimmy] What would you do with
   a few hundred grand, baby?
            - What?
      - [Jimmy] What
      would you do with a
      few hundred grand,
      if you go it today?
          Or tomorrow?
      (gentle piano music)
        - I don't know.
Put it down on a house, I guess.
      I have no idea, why?
   - [Jimmy] Just wondering.
       - I would put some
       money away for
   Mickey's college, I
   would definitely do that.
        (bacon sizzling)
 - [Jimmy] I would start a lot.
  - What, like a parking lot?
       - [Jimmy] No, like
       a used car lot.
   I would buy and sell cars.
 Maybe I'd take you on a trip.
  I hear Pontiac, Michigan's
  beautiful this time of year.
      - [Shereen] Let's go
      to the East Coast.
          - Let's go.
      (gentle piano music)
 Mm, this bacon's so good baby.
         - You like it?
     - I'm in love with it.
     Almost as much as you.
  - You don't need money when
   bacon makes you so happy.
         - Damn right.
       I was going down
       to Alvera Street,
       and I saw it and
       I thought of you.
          You like it?
          - I love it.
      (gentle piano music)
        - [Jimmy] What?
           - Nothing.
   - Then what's the problem?
     - It makes me feel
     uncomfortable when you
     look at me like that.
     - You're going to have
     to explain that to me.
      (gentle piano music)
            (sighs)
      - I love you Jimmy.
             I do.
            I just.
          - Just what?
   - Let me tell you a story.
   When I was a little girl,
       I went to visit my
       family in Mexico.
      And that summer
      they had this goat.
          On the farm.
      I loved little Billy
      more than anything.
       He was black and
       white, and used to
     follow me everywhere.
       I was only five
       years old, and I'd
  never been on a farm before.
     So I didn't understand
     that they would
     raise a goat once a
     year, to be harvested
    in the Fall, for the
    festival to make berria.
     One day, I was
     called to the corral,
as everyone else in the family.
     We gather around, and,
  we watched as my
  grandfather slaughtered him.
      Being so young, I
      had no idea this was
     going to happen, so...
            I was...
Desperate and I started to cry.
       As my grandfather
       cut his throat.
     When he heard my
     cries, the poor billy
     became distressed
     and started to panic,
   and struggle for his life.
  - He was being slaughtered.
             - No.
        That wasn't it.
      Everyone else,
      including the goat,
      up to that point,
      were extremely calm.
       It was actually
       me who scared him.
My Tia grabbed my hand and said,
         "Let him go."
 "Your fears are scaring him."
"His life was not meant for you,
  "he doesn't belong to you."
    "His life was meant for
    a different purpose."
       "He gives his body
       and blood to us,
       "and we thank him
       by honoring him
      "for his sacrifice."
     (gentle string music)
    At first I was confused.
     But then I understood.
     (gentle string music)
   And my empathy evaporated,
 and I realized she was right.
       It was me who was
       keeping him here.
     - So what did you do?
    (ominous ambient music)
           (sobbing)
        - I let him go.
            (sighs)
    (dramatic ambient music)
           Thank you.
    (dramatic ambient music)
           (humming)
      - Hey man, I got to
      ask you something.
             - Hm?
      - You consider Pizza
      Hut a pizzeria?
        - I don't know.
  - I'm asking you a question.
           Yes or no?
    - No, I don't think
    Pizza Hut is a pizzeria.
             - No?
   They serve fucking pizza.
            - Okay.
      You know, I went
      there the other day
     and got in an argument
     with the waitress.
    I asked for two slices.
        She says, "No."
    - I don't think they
    do slices at Pizza Hut.
    - That's not the point.
     The point is, I
     asked for two slices,
    she goes, "What do we
    look like, a pizzeria?"
     Now tell me that
     wouldn't piss you off.
     - Got to work on your
     anger management.
    - Yea, anger management.
           - Breathe.
   - Take it in, let it out.
      Pop her in the face.
           (chuckles)
   What's the plan here, man?
     - Keri's going to pull
     up, drop the car off,
     he's going to be
     under the wheel well,
    package is in the back.
    - Under the wheel well,
    or on the wheel well?
      - [Tommy] It's
      under the wheel well
       in like a, little
       hide-a-key thing.
   - The fuck's a hide-a-key?
  - Know what a hide-a-key is?
    Little fucking black
    box, got magnets on it?
Slidey door, key goes in there,
    your stick it under the
    car, in case you leave.
          - (mumbles).
    - A fucking hide-a-key.
        - I'll find it.
    - Got those hide-a-keys
    that got those
    little fake rocks, you
    never seen those shits?
   - Dude, I'm from Brooklyn,
   we got no fake rocks.
       (tires squealing)
      I'll find it though.
- [Gangster] Can't see anything.
    - Just give it a minute.

            No, no!
           (gunshot)
          No, no, no!
          Oh fuck, no!
    (dramatic ambient music)
              Hey!
           You, you!

     (tense keyboard music)
       (cell phone rings)
       (cell phone rings)
       (cell phone rings)
            - Hello?
         - Who is this?
         - Who's this?
     - This is the guy
     that knows that you're
    speaking on a dead man's
    cell phone, that's who.
     Some stunt you pulled
     back there kid.
      - What do you want?
           Big Tommy?
       - Alright, listen.
     Before you and I get
     off on the wrong foot,
       I'm going to give
       you an opportunity
       to set this right.
Under normal circumstances, that
   wouldn't exist for someone
   in your predicament.
       Right, but this
       shit is personal.
     Keep in mind that the
     man that I work for,
       he's not going to
       stop until you are
  cut into little tiny pieces.
      - You think I don't
      know that already?
     - Well then what's it
     going to take for you
   to bring me back the car?
    - Don't you mean kidney?
   That's not going to happen
   until I have my money.
 - How much did they offer you?
          - 250 grand.
        - I'll match it.
            - Go on.
- I want to know who hired you.
     - I'm not saying
     anything until I have
      my insurance policy.
    - Well, you're going to
    need more than that kid.
    (ominous ambient music)
      - What do you mean?
    - It's going to take
    more than a simple trade
   to set this straight, you
   killed one of our guys.
            Alright?
      That being said,
      there's going to be
    a price on your head,
    people are going to die.
    If you want to get this
    straight, you and I,
      we're going to have
      to work together
     so that means that we
     will have to establish
          some trust.
            Alright?
 I want to know who hired you.
    (ominous ambient music)
      - I'll call you back
      in a half an hour.
      In the mean time,
      you can talk to Roy.
    (dramatic ambient music)
       (heavy breathing)
    (dramatic ambient music)
  - Now I need you to tell me
    exactly what it is
    that you want me to do.
    (dramatic ambient music)
         - Nothing yet.
    I just need the package.
       Some place safe
       for my protection.
   Just go home and hang
   tight, and I'll call you.
     - Okay, but I thought
     you wanted my help
        with these guys.
       - The only thing
       I need now is for
      the package to be
      some place safe with
      someone I can trust.
 Can you do that for me Clyde?
    (dramatic ambient music)
             - Yea.
      Yea, I can do that.
       - Then I need to
       make a phone call.
          (screaming)
     - I'm gonna call you,
 get your money for you, okay?
              Bye.
       That motherfucker.
        - [Sledge] Yea.
       What are you going
       to to about it?
  - I'm a lead the kid there,
     and let him handle it.
        That's the plan.
      (cell phone buzzes)
          Here he is.
You want your money, don't you?
         - [Jimmy] Yea.
     - Then you're going to
     have to go in there,
       and you're going
       to have to get it.
      Alright, that's the
      deal we're making.
Look, we'll be right behind you.
      Okay, as soon as the
      Armenians get here,
    we're going to swoop in.
    (ominous ambient music)
   (dramatic swelling effect)
           (gunshot)
       - [Crystal] Baby?
     You can come out now.
           (yelling)
      - [Austin] You'll
      only make it worse!
           (yelling)
           (yelling)
           (yelling)
           (yelling)
           (yelling)
        Is it the pain?
     Or the horror of being
     maimed that's worse?
      - You're a monster!
        - I'm an artist.
            (crying)
    (dramatic ambient music)
  You know why I'm an artist?
      It's because the
      lines you can draw.
     The layers of a person
       you can peel away.
         Like an onion.
   If it's (mumbles) enough,
         you see steam
      rising off of them.
         All that heat.
         All that life.
           Literally.
          Evaporating.
           (sobbing)
       I feel its fever.
           (sobbing)
       - [Jimmy] Help me!
         Help, help me!
 - You can scream all you want,
      nobody can hear you!
    (ominous ambient music)
           (sobbing)
             Ready?
              Huh?
            - Wait!
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!
     - [Austin] Baby, baby!
   This is my favorite part.
           (laughter)
            - Baby?
    (ominous ambient music)
    - Gevorg, what the fuck?
    (ominous ambient music)
    (dramatic ambient music)
      - What the fuck,
      where were you guys?
   - We had to wait for the
   cavalry to show up Jimmy.
       - So what's next,
       what are we doing?
     - You're going to take
     the money to Roy's.
    Look, I promised him
    the money for the info.
       Then we ripped his
       fingernail out.
Then I guess you could say that
     I needed an
     insurance policy too.
    (ominous ambient music)
           Thank you.
        I appreciate it.
   I'll call you later okay?
            Thanks.
    (dramatic ambient music)
  You alright with this, huh?
    (dramatic ambient music)
     - So basically I have
     to convince this guy
       that I'm going to
       give up my life,
    and give him the kidney?
         - [Tommy] Yea.
           Basically.
  - What if he doesn't buy it?
  - Look Jimmy, just play it
  like we talked about, okay?
   Assure him, reassure him.
         Convince him.
      - He's just going to
      give me 150 grand?
 - Yea, if you can convince him
 that you're willing to die.
     I think he will, yes.
    (dramatic ambient music)
     You can do this Jimmy.
    (dramatic ambient music)
      - And I don't value
      my life that much,
         I never have.
    But just so we're clear,
      I'm not asking you,
        I'm telling you.
     I need a little time.
    (ominous ambient music)
   - He needs a little money,
 and you're going to drive him.
- And we'll just meet back here?
       - [Lorenzo] Yea.
            - Okay.
We're going to let him keep it?
      - What do you think?
    (tense orchestral music)
      - I don't know, he
      seems alright to me.
And if he brings us the package.
       - Shame it had to
       go down like this.
             - Yea.
    (tense orchestral music)
    Could have been any of
    us back in the day, huh?
        - But it wasn't.
    (tense orchestral music)
  - Alright, well I should go.
         - If the kid,
     so much as hints that
     he's going to book,
            do him.
            - Okay.
      - You got two hours.
     I'll go get the money.
    (tense orchestral music)
      (crickets chirping)
  - So you talked to your guy,
      he knows what to do?
- I told him exactly what to do.
- But I mean, you're confident?
   I mean you trust him that
   he can do this, right?
      - He said he would.
       - Alright, but,
       you know, this has
    got to look real Jimmy.
       If this is going
       to work, you know,
     for both of us, okay?
     - Don't worry, this
     guy's a perfectionist.
     (tense ambient music)
        - He better be.
     (tense ambient music)
     (pounding on the door)
 - [Jimmy] Here's her address.
       Promise me you'll
       give it to her.
           - Jesus.
         - Promise me!
       - Jesus, I promise
       man, I promise!
    (dramatic ambient music)
   - I don't have much time.
     - Yo Jimmy, wait man!
     I got something I got
     to say before you go.
     After my mother died,
   my father and I were never
   really the same, you know?
     And I know that he saw
     you as more of a son
      than he ever saw me.
       And that was hard.
   I never got to say
   goodbye to my father, man.
    And I know you did right
    by him when he was sick.
    And I never got a chance
    to thank you for that.
  So in case for some reason,
  I don't ever see you again,
        I love you man.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
      You sure you're
      going to be alright?
           You sure?
        - Yea, I'm sure.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
           (sobbing)
           (gunshot)
    (ominous ambient music)
 - [Lorenzo] Take care of this.
    (ominous ambient music)
           (panting)
  (dramatic orchestral music)
    - [Tommy] It's alright.
          You alright?
  (dramatic orchestral music)
     You did good, come on.
            Come on!
  (dramatic orchestral music)
     Come on, walk it off.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
              Woo.
        (Jimmy coughing)
            Alright.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
        (Tommy humming)
  (dramatic orchestral music)
     (dramatic piano music)
             Ready?
     (dramatic piano music)
             (bang)
              Hey.
          You alright?
         You did good.
        - So that's it?
       - Unless she dies
       Jimmy, and then
  I'm going to come find you.
          - She won't.
             - Yea.
        But if she does.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
        Oh my goodness.
           (chuckles)
   You know Jimmy, you and I
       actually made a
       pretty good team.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
   - Can I ask you something?
        - [Tommy] Sure.
        - Why'd you want
        to work with me?
          - I didn't.
 Jimmy, I did this for Sierra.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
    - Lorenzo's little girl?
  (dramatic orchestral music)
    - Yea, Lorenzo's her
    father,you know, but...
     She's my little girl.
            - I see.
  - He wasn't lying, you know?
He would have killed you Jimmy,
   he would have killed you.
    He wouldn't have
    thought twice about it.
           You know?
   But then we would have
   lost the package and I...
  (dramatic orchestral music)
          I just, I...
     I couldn't have that.
    And I'm sure he gave
    you a great performance
   when he was
   interrogating you, but...
       Truth is, he is a
       horrible father.
       - So you love her?
  (dramatic orchestral music)
  - Can't have kids of my own.
        And it's not her
        fault, you know?
    It's not her fault that
    her father's a gangster,
    and mom was a whore.
   And she can say, you know?
      It's not her fault.
      I don't know Jimmy.
     There's no playbook
     for this type of shit.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
I didn't like letting you walk,
   after what you did to Lou.
      Like I said,
      there's no playbook.
      All I know is that,
  in this line of work, you...
    You make the guy that's
    got the thing you want,
     you make him an ally.
         Not an enemy.
    That's how I played it.
  (dramatic orchestral music)
 - Well I hope you know that I
     never would have taken
     this job if I had
known what the package was for.
     - Doesn't matter now.
    (dramatic ambient music)
             Here.
    (dramatic ambient music)
     - Time to cash in
     that insurance policy?
             - Yea.
       I want you to call
       me when it's done.
             Okay?
    (dramatic ambient music)
           Hey Jimmy.
      You asked me, but...
        Why'd you do it?
    (dramatic ambient music)
  - It was the ultimate boost.
    (dramatic ambient music)
      - You disappear kid.
    (dramatic ambient music)
       (door chimes ring)
      - Back the fuck up!
          Take a seat!
       - Jimmy, Jimmy,
       take it easy man!
        - Take it easy?
  - Please, have a seat Jimmy.
- I'm not sitting anymore today.
     I don't want to talk,
     I just want my money.
          Pick it up!
          Open it up!
            Shut it!
           - Please.
      Now, come on, Jimmy.
      - [Jimmy] Fuck you.
         - Do you mind?
         - Do it slow!
    - You know I lied Jimmy.
           - No shit!
      - About the tequila.
       It's really cheap.
 - All tastes like shit to me.
- Okay, one last request, amigo.
  How did we end up this way?
     - I guess I got lucky.
   - I don't believe in luck.
  - You could use some by now.
      - Hey you don't
      have to do this man,
      you got your money.
      - And you almost got
      me killed, twice!
   - Hey, it wasn't personal!
         - How's that?
           - Lorenzo.
   Killed my cousin Graciela.
      This was my first
      chance to get even.
       - Why me, why the
       bullshit story?
- I wanted to get rid of Austin.
      I figured Lorenzo's
      guys would kill him.
     And I was hoping you'd
     get away, and you did!
   - You're a terrible liar.
   But it doesn't matter now.
I'm not killing you for Lorenzo.
  He already thinks I'm dead.
   - So Tommy gets his wish.
  At the hands of a dead man.
    - These things play out.
 - That's why I like you Jimmy.
     'Cause you're smarter
     than the average bear.
      But let me give you
      a word of advice.
        For the future.
      You wear your heart
      on you sleeve.
    And that makes you weak.
        - So my life was
        worth 500 grand?
     And now I'm buying it
     back for a lot more.
   - You would have done the
   same thing in my position.
         - Hard to say.
         - Salut Jimmy.
          - Salut Roy.
           (gunshot)
           (humming)
      (cell phone buzzing)
            - Hello?
          - It's done.
     - No, sorry, you got
     the wrong number, bud.
