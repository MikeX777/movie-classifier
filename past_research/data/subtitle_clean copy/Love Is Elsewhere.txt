Everyone would have emotional problems
when they are growing up
Come talk to us,
it just costs you a hundred
for a drink.
That includes a real
good chat,
go for it.
And that's the style of
''SOHO with love''.
l have my own car,
apartment and l am beautiful too...
men should chase
after me though.
l just want to find someone...
to have a spectacular
romance with me.
l sell insurance to my clients
for a life time guarantee.
And l do want to find someone...
who would fall in love with me
for a life time too.
There is something in your teeth.
Really?
l can't get hard.
ln fact l'm not impotent,
l just can't make love
to my wife.
But l do have sexual desire
to other women.
Why does my boyfriend
bring me to see Keroro
movie every time?
And he always takes me to
Mcdonald or Kentucky for meal.
He won't go out with me unless
there comes the comic exhibition
Would you guys be
a bit mature?
Well, guys used to get
matured late.
l urge him to propose to me for
one hundred times before marrying him
because l want to have enough time
for us to think about it seriously.
And l do hope our relationship
will get better.
But, is it getting
even worse now?
He already proposed
to me for 96 times.
Whenever he buys me anything that
would be something that he likes
and he doesn't care
what l really want.
What do you want actually?
l am kind of falling
for a girl, but...
l don't know how to get
approach to her.
Have you ever gone
out with someone?
Of course l do.
And you are too coward.
She's rich, educated
and older than me...
You can still tell her that you
like her, if you don't...
she never know what
you are thinking about.
lf you do, maybe..
you will have the chance, huh?
Yeah.
That's right.
But l don't even know her.
Love is not rational,
you can't ask why
Otherwise that's not love.
Breaking up is like getting
a scar on the skin.
lt hurts at the beginning,
it'll be covered by the make-up.
As you look carefully,
it leaves a scar there.
l know they said l'm insane.
But someone says, only the insane
knows what love is.
One should indulge in love,
crazy about love
Otherwise that's not love.
Love Hurray
Feel much better now.
lt's getting hard to
find someone like you have the
patience to listen to my story
lt really worths it.
Thank you.
Save the money and
go to Beijing soon.
l know that, bye.
ls someone looking for you
two unlicensed psychiatrists?
What's up, doctor trainee?
What would you like to
talk about today?
l'd like to talk about the fact.
l think there should be
impact to life, failure...
no matter it's about
my career or love,
l will fix that up immediately,
no delay.
You two just listen to
stories of others,

l don't want to waste
our time.

What's happening?
Operation fails.
You are so early,

the greatness of love,
the inscription of love.
They just never taste
the frustration of love.
What are you doing?
You srewed up

lt's not my fault...the guy
bumped into me...
Sing... stop keep on

You should be devoted

Same.

Because Sung and l are saving money for

Not enough still?

That is fine, it would be
terrible if you do.
You are jealous.
Just take me as l am jealous.
What's up to you now?
What? l am fine.
Stop that.
l got nothing to do with this,
he held my hand so suddenly.
lt's okay.
You have come.
l've told you that l will.
Have a seat.
Why did you leave

Watch out, ...
You are maniac.
To go for rescue
Rescue? Rescue?

l went back to bring
everything here
to see whether it is gonna help.
Secondly, my name is Sing.

You can just call me Yu.
Yu.
But why were you being
outside my gallery so late?

You really scared me, honey.
When l got your SMS,
l returned your call
But your cell phone is off and
l couldn't get through
the gallery line.
So l came back at once.
Yes, l did that purposely.
lf not,
you would only come back after
the share market is closed.
And l would probably be
crippled at that time.
l will take care of you forever
even if you are crippled.
Sing!
You are out for delivery
so early?
Yeah, the customer... doesn't
want the soup.
Maybe you can have it.
lt'd be useless even
if l bring it back.
Will your uncle get
mad on you?
What kind of soup is this?
Chicken feet with dog backbone
(Chinese Medicine).
Dog feet?
Chicken feet with dog backbone
(Chinese Medicine).

But you key in your number

You are so wicked.
Wicked? l forgot to give it

Not giving him the number
is not wicked.
But you peep on other's
information on the net,
that's rascal.
As l clicked on it and
that's the first page,
l am not doing it on purpose.
That's not an excuse.
Peeping on other's privacy
is a criminal offense.
lt would be great for you
two being in jail together.
Come and talk with me.
l treat you to meal.
Punk, here comes the soup.
Dog feet soup.
Dog feet soup? New stuff.
Come on in.
Come in.

You just don't care about me.
Sorry.
lf there is anything,

Okay.
Mis Ng, you'd better not move around
as your leg is still hurt.
You guys are all the same.

Thank you.
Miss Ng, why do you
want to be a painter?
l am not a painter.

How about you? You are
so gentle to be a delivery boy.
ln fact my uncle
owns that restaurant.
He told me to help him
for l am not good at my study.
He is trying to train me
to behave well.
My parents had divorced
since l was small.
lt's my uncle who has been
taking care of me.
Do you have your own dream?
Do you really want to do the
delivery work for the rest of your life?

He knows a bit mandarin.
That'd be alright.

Mandarin Hotel.
A foreigner who speaks mandarin.
How's that?

Tonight? l have to work.
Yesterday, you said you will

Please call me Derek.
Derek.

Do you want to eat or not?
Be quick, meet you at the escalator
on Hollywood Road then.
Okay, bye.
Why? Why are you crying?
Just a bit late, you don't
have to cry though.
Are you pregnant or
being dump?
Of course not pregnant!
My boyfriend broke up
with me..
Broke up? That is good,
you can have new one now.
How can you be so mean?
l really love him.
How long have you
been together?
We have been together
for over a year.
Though he is fat and ugly,
he is a nice person.
So l try to be with him then.
l can't imagine that
he would be so cruel to me.
Did he hang out
with other girls?
l've told you that
he is fat and ugly.
lt would be his luck to have me
as his girlfriend.
No other girls will be
interested in him.
Stop crying.
Let's go, l am going to
tell you a story.
Come on, let's buy something
to drink.
Let's go
Have a walk and have a good drink,
everything would be fine.
Trust me.
l have a friend,
he's been with his girlfriend
for a year and a half.
His girlfriend is expecting
to marry him.
But my friend was fed up
with their relationship.
And he finally broke up
with her,
do you know why?
Why?
He told me that
in ancient time,
if you don't bury
the body well,
the corpse will be rotten
and became harmful to others.
For love,
if you don't end
a rotten relationship,
you are going to hurt
your lover.
Love will turn into sympathy.
and it is just a waste
of time.
Sympathy is like the
rotten body,
it's gonna be harmful.
Where did your friend
hear this story?
l told him that.
You are very special.
Are you going to
recede this time?
You always do that?
Do you often bring
girls here?
What do you expect then?
You don't let me
take you home.
Feeling tired and
want to have a rest.
You did make a good choice.
l do, this place is nice.
Come on,
just bury your love then.
l won't.
lt's going to rot.
That's you.
Hey, doc, how is it?
How are you doing?
Did your eyes get swollen?
lt's alright.
Trainees should be busy though,
how can you make
your call so often?
Tomorrow is my day-off.
lt's just...
l want to treat you to dinner,
are you available tomorrow?
Are you going or not?
Whatever.
l will just count
you in then.
Tomorrow night at seven,
l will call you.
Who will call so late
at the night?
That's the Prime
Credit Brothers.
See you at seven.
Sorry, honey.
Last night,
the US market collapsed,
l don't have time
to take your call.
Are you alright?
lt's lucky that Sing
was here,
l have been looking
for you all night.
lt's that bastard again.
Haven't l done anything
for you?
You keep seeing him
so often.
Why is he keep hanging
around you?
As both of you got drunk,
did he try to screw you?
Would you mind your words?
You just care about
the market,
do you really care
about me?
Don't l?
l just want to tell you that
the kids now are quite mature.
Nonsense! l don't want to
talk about it.
l don't think l have time
to see you this week.
You check out the new
apartment on your own.
And don't hang around
with that kid.
Because you are my girlfriend
and l am your boyfriend.
Punk, somebody wrote on
our walls.
ls boss going to
blame on us?
Shouldn't be.
That's nice, never mind.
You guys are here.
l drank a lot last night,
can l have a coffee?
l got it...
Ching.
l have something to
tell you.
lt's the 99th time,
but l think...
l got it,
come on in.
Sung.
Sing.
lt's hot.
No one wants the
soup again?
Yeah, it's for you.
That's hot.
Miss Ng of the studio
doesn't want it..
What is it?
Ginseng with kudzu vine.
lt's good, it relieves
your hang over.
Ginseng with kudzu vine?
Alright, l will have it,
how much?
No need, enjoy it.
Thanks... honey,
here is the soup.
Ginseng with kudzu vine.
lt is good to your brian
and recovers my energy.
But it's hot, be careful.
You... drank a lot?
Sorry.
l don't know you will
bring me soup...
Maybe you order
a drink instead.
Okay.
Thanks for last night.
That's okay.
Are you free tonight?
What? l am free.
l would like to
have dinner with you.
Great.
Sir.
l help you with
the soup, okay?
Okay.
You always peep on us
outside the studio?
Well, l...
l like you.
Kid, do you know what
you are talking about?
Have you ever hate
your parents?
Why should l?
They separated without caring
about your feeling.
Don't you hate them?
l don't.
At least they separated
when l was small.
Otherwise,
l will be so upset.
l do think that once
people get married,
they shouldn't have
a divorce.
lf they do, why should
they get married?
You have seen my fiance.
What do you think
about him?
Your finace... is smart,
handsome and nice.
What? You want to
break up with him?
After last night incident,
l don't think
l need him anymore.
l need someone who really
loves me and cares about me.
And he will do
anything for me.
Yes.
He will care about me,
when l am angry with him
Bnd everything will be
back to usual soon
l do wonder that
if the stock market and
l are both in danger,
will he help me
out first?
Of course, he can't do anything
about the stock market.
Have you got
a make-up mirror?
What for?
Take it out.
Open it.
Put it on the table,
face to yourself.
Now you close your eyes,
imagine there is a devil
on your left
and an angel
on your right.
Which side will be
your fiance on?
After that, take the mirror,
you will have the answer.
Thanks, you are great.
l used to do this
whenever l am in trouble.
Hope you don't
find it stupid.
You have got the answer,
mabe l...
bring you to a place
to cheer up.
Where?
You will know
as you get there.
Mr. Yeung,
this way please.
Thanks...
Thank you for coming
to my show tonight.
Before you leave,
l give you guys a riddle.
You guys will get a nice pose
when taking photo,
that's a famous female.
Lovely queen.
No...
Sailormoon.
Sailormoon.
lt's not Sailormoon.
How about at the back?
Do you know the answer?
Wait.
Just stay here,
l will be back soon.
l have seen
a beautiful girl.
Hey! lt's you!
You come for the show?
But we are over.
Over?
lt's over.
lt's over.
l do charge you though.
You come to see me,
do you know who l am?
Handsome guy?
Handsome...
Dare you say that.
You still have to pay
even you say that.
lt's obvious that
she's not coming for me.
Well, here comes
our next performer.
Our in-house singer.
Sing!
You are really nice.
Thanks...
Can we take a picture?
Maybe next time,
my friends are...
l have another
show on 24th here.
Okay? See you then.
Bye.
Bye.
You sang well.
And you do have
lots of fans.
l already said you
want to be a star.
Let's go.
l have a show on X'mas
Eve at 3am,
are you coming?
X'mas Eve? Okay.
Have you ever been
to my uncle's restaurant?
No, maybe next time.
Maybe l take you home.
Okay.
Will your boyfriend be there?
l don't think so,
we had a fight this morning.
Excuse me, Mr. Yeung,
we are about to close.
Check please.
l have a great time tonight,
thanks for accompanying me.
Thanks for taking me home.
Kelly, why are you
leaving so early?
Well, l have to meet
my friends in other place.
l have a fatal disease,
only you can help me.
l will wait for you
at the disco until you come.
Look at this,
it's interesting.
Yeah, maybe we should
draw something on it.
Do you have a pen?
Who is it?
l will call the police.
Let's go.
Come on,
t's been scrawled already.
Bro, don't touch my wall.
Your patient is recovered,
go out and have a walk.
Let's go...
Please, get going.
No way, it's getting worse.
ls it blackmail
by the triad?
Do you owe someone money?
Let's report
this to the police.
Go ahead. He said he would
call the police just now.
You'd better leave.
lt's just number,
not foul language.
But it does look like something
as you look at it carefully.
l have to go, you guys
look great tonight.
Bro, you look great...
You guys too...
Why are you here?
l told you
l always peep at you.
Don't you need to work?
Sorry, honey.
l know what l said that
day was too much.
l know l have been
neglecting you.
So l haven taken
a two-month leave.
And we can enjoy
the holiday.
Okay?
Did you put it on
for me?
lsn't it pretty?
Don't you know how to care
about other's feeling?
l do.
l am trying hard to
be a good boyfriend.
l have been working hard
for our future.
This is the...
Sorry, you can't give me
the thing that l want.
Just tell me what
you want then?
You tell me and
l will do my best.
This is the 100th
time proposal...
You promised me that you will
marry me, l do love you.
Ho.
That's not the point,
something is missing
between us.
Don't you understand?
Sorry. We are over.
Maybe we need some time
to calm down.
l am going to
work now.
l know l haven't been with
you for quite a while.
Would you please
give me a chance?
Please, okay?
As l came just now,
there was a soup and
a bunch of flower.
And l took them in.
Look, it's great.
Stupid! You still
said it's great?
We don't have much
saving this month.
Self-tour in Europe,
thirty thousand will do.
Did you hear what
l said?
l said we don't save much
at all for this month
and you are still
planning for a trip.
ln fact, since we can't save much,
let's have a trip then.
What the hell! We have planned
for a two-year saving.
This is the third year,
and the fourth year is coming.
You are not going to
graduate until thirty.
Business is bad and
that's not my fault.
Ask Hung
to help you out then.
We promised not to talk
about him again.
Okay, l am going to
call Hung now.
Hung.
l would like to go to Beijing,
please buy me a ticket.
Okay, when are you
planning to go?
24th, it's a good day.
Alright, l will fax you
the itinerary tomorrow.
Thanks, bye.
You go back alone.
Did you call him?
Did you do as
l told you?
l did, everything is done.
l've been role-playing that
l almost forgot who l am.
He is not that bad though.
Don't be soft-hearted,
he did the same
to me before.
He is bad,
he's a swindler.
He won't change.
Never.
Trust me,
he won't change.
Do you really like him?
No way!
Just help me to date
him out.
l want to fix him up
on X'mas Eve,
got it?
Yanka, l would like to
ask you a favor.
Joe, are you coming later?
l am having a headache.
Can you bring me
some pills?
And buy me some milk please.
Okay, thanks.
How are you doing?
Thank you.
Milk.
Your pills.
No need...
l don't have change.
That's okay.
Where is Kelly?
Over there.
Thank you.
My cousin has a wedding
party on 24th.
Are you coming?
Okay.
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.
l do, why not.
l will even take
a day off for that.
lt would be nice to get
to know your friends.
There is nothing special
about my friends.
lf you are busy, you really
don't have to go.
That's oaky,
l will go for sure.
Why don't you go inside
to eat?
l am not used to go to
place like this.
But you do order delivery
so often?
The food is really
good though.
You have to compromise
to something that you like.
Just take a seat to
enjoy your food.
Don't you need
to perform tonight?
l would rather stay
with you
l don't want to
be like Ho,
he cares nothing about you
but only about his work.
Can you stop comparing
with Ho?
What would you like,
Ho become more attentive or
l become more mature?
Do you understand
what l am saying?
We haven't talked
much since that night.
Maybe we are going too fast.
We don't know each other
that well?
l will work hard and l will
give you everything,
l will love you dearly...
l will find another job...
lf you like,
l will go back to study...
You are still young.
You are going to experience
different things
and people.
Since that night,
l know you are the one.
You are my destiny,
l won't like others.
You are going to have
different girlfriends.
Maybe you don't even remember
who l am whey you get older.
How would l...
l have been watching and
loving you for so long.
You just peeped at me.
That's not love.
What do you know, kid?
Sung, you are off already?
Yeah.
l just want to have
a chat though.
lf you don't mind,
we can chat here.
ls Ching here?
She left already,
you want to chat with her?
Sing.
l think l can't
help you today.
l just had a quarrel
with Ching.
But you can come back
in two days,
l am gonna help you.
Why are looking at
my stuff?
l am checking the name
and date for you.
l leave my luggage here.
l will come back
to take it.
Please don't touch that.
Should l give him
the painting?
l am afraid he will think that
l am teasing on him.
For not saving enough money
for studying in Beijing.
What's up to you guys?
l don't know
whether he has ever thought
about our future.
We are saving hard
for the tuition fee
and he just spent
it casually.
Here is your delivery.
Seventy five dollars.
Just call me get the bowl back
as you finish the soup.
Ching.
ln the past three years,
l have been so happy.
l am sorry
for my fooling around
and l forgot
about my promise.
l think l really have
to graduate after thirty.
But l do hope you can
fulfill your dream soon.
Here is the money
we have been saving up..
lt should be enough
for you.
Although you didn't say you
want to break up with me.
As l saw Hung holding
your hands,
and he bought the ticket
for you,
l know l am not good enough
for you,
he knows how to love you.
And the numbers is the song
that you like most.
l am going to sing
it to you again,
you can listen to
it when you get bored.
Study hard, my dear.
l don't have the chance to wait
for the blossom of our love.
l have been waiting
for your rescue.
Hoping that the fireworks
would last forever.
Making you feel insecure,
adoration will be fading away.
How long would
the appearance last?
Starting to surmise as suspicion arise,
it will soon be replaced.
You do care about
my seldom applause.
You sing really well.
Santa Claus is going
off duty.
Let's go for the
X'mas carol.
Do you think she
will come, boss?
Definitely,
have you ever heard...
if you believe,
everything is impossible.
l think she is in Beijing now.
You even know Santa
Claus is in Beijing?
l mean Ching.
Ching? Beijing?
Aren't you two going together?
l... don't have enough money.
What are you doing
here then?
Waiting for Ching.
You said she is Beijing?
l wrote some shorthand
code on the wall.
l told her to go to the place
where we first met on X'mas Eve.
lf she sees that,
she will come.
You guys have a quarrel!
How do you know she can
read your code?
We've learnt that when
we were small.
When you were small?
Should everyone know what
you are thinking about?
You are just doing the things
that you like,
did you care about others?
Codes, signs?
You ask for it.
What is it?
Maybe l shouldn't go in, huh?
Why? We are at the door.
lt's not going to
be fun though,
l just want to be with you
on X'mas Eve.
Never mind, just leave the gift
then we go, okay?
Come on.
ls it here?
l am telling you,
your X'mas wish...
is going to be fulfilled,
you are gonna lose it.
Sad?
Couple, got it?
Can you take it?
lt's tough.
You hate long hair?
l can cut it.
l found a beautiful
gal here.
A beautiful girl must have a lot of
things to do on X'mas eve.
l don't.
Do you recognize me?
But Sing is not here yet.
Are you going to sit here
and wait?
Yes.
Give her a big hand then.
Thanks, merry X'mas.
Joe.
Why are you so late?
You look great tonight.
Thanks.
Kathy and Rachel,
you know them.
Haven't seen you for long.
Who is your cousin?
Joe, l have something
to tell you.
What?
Listen, our passion is gone.
And our love will soon
transform to sympathy.
lt'll be getting worse.
Now you know what
l felt that day.
You deserve this.
l almost forgot,
l have a X'mas gift for you.
A doctor trainee sells illegal drugs in the disco.
Ching.
Why are you crying alone
on X'mas eve?
Have you seen my honey?
Honey? Me?
Sung, he has left.
He did not.
He told me that he left
already in his recording.
He did.
No, Santa Claus won't lie.
You are really rush.
Where is he?
He told you to study,
he really cares about you.
Why should you find him?
Studying is good.
Uncle, you don't understand.
Studying alone is meaningless.
Please tell me
where is he?
Studying alone is meaningless.?
How romantic!
Come on, where is he?
lt's all on the wall,
look it up yourself.
Why did you hiy me?
What did he write?
Have you learnt that before?
That's shorthand code.
The romantic place,
the first X'mas Eve, we...
Kelly...
Kelly...
l am sorry, l don't know
it'll turn out like this.
All of them said you are bad,
so l helped them.
l do know that
you know Maggie.
Prime Credit Brothers
told me that.
We have been together
for year and a half,
how couldn't l recognize
her voice?
Why did you come then?
l did cheat you,
but l know nothing
about the magazine.
l don't care.
Every couple would keep
their own secrets, right?
As long as the love
is true will do.
No one knows about the future.
But you are the one that
l have been thinking of.
l will go back
to Canada tomorrow.
Sorry.
So many things
happened lately,
it's not going to settle
that in one day.
Don't you need to perform?
l don't have the mood
to sing though...
l don't want to go.
Sing, who do think you are?
Even a superstar should be
responsible to his fans.
Come on.
Have you ever thought
of your loved one?
No matter what,
you can share your feeling
with her?
Didn't you leave already?
No way!
lt's for you.
Why are you holding a broom...
To hit Hung
So easy to get angry?
Let me give you a kiss.
Sorry, honey.
Sorry, honey.
Who would dare to
let you choose now.
Or l am just pretending for
l am too nervous.
Be brave and
date you for lunch.
Although l am not
smart enough,
l dare to make my move
at once.
l will buy you flowers and
l will do my best.
l am sorry for what
happened last time.
lt's for you.
This wedding is real.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yes, did the medical board
check you up?
lt's over now,
l did nothing at all.
l became so popular
in the hospital now.
That's great, girls
will approach to you.
l should say sorry to you.
l will handle well
with my love,
it won't be that messy again.
Well, Kelly will be
my bridemaid.
You better handle that well.
Come earlier on that day, bye.
Bye.
How is it, gal?
You have been coming here
everyday in this month.
Just looking at the soup menu
without order anything.
What kind of soup
do you like?
l stop peeping at you.
You don't have soup lately,
you look bad.
Just drink it up.
What soup is this?
Soup with Lotus seeds and Lilies.
Just drink it up.
What is it?
ls there thief or cockroach?
The phone!
You just answer it.
Maybe it's calling from Hung.
He is your friend.
He must be looking for
you then.
You answer it.
l have something
to tell you
Please hold on.
You can talk now.
l want you to
come to Beijing.
For what?
We have enough money
for studying in Beijing.
Okay, it's just business.
Don't get too excited,
l told my father...
about the counselling cafe
you run in HK,
unfortunately...
He likes this idea.
He would like to have one
in the hotel.
He said it would work,
what do you think?
We have to think about it.
Still need to think?
We made it.
We can use our saving to go
for a Europe tour.
Then we have to learn Mandarin
before going to Beijing.
Okay.
She lied to me.
l like her as l first saw
her in the disco.
She lied to me though.
lt seems that you first
lied to my cousin.
l am serious
in every romance.
And it just doesn't
work out at last.
She lied to me though.
in fact, love can't be...
Counted.
No need to count, and...
Let me.
You go ahead!
Tell me when did you
start liking me?
You didn't like me on the first
night we met at the disco.
l did see you are flirting
with another girl.
That's not me for sure.
l am going to
tell you that...
it's not important that
who cheats in love.
lt is not important for
when did it start.
Do you love him?
When should l call you?
No one knows
about the future.
But you are the one
l have been thinking of.
Do you love him?
That's perfect
No such word in madarin?
Wrong again!
l like someone but
l am afraid that...
How many relationships
have you ever had?
l don't remember.
Why don't you have
the courage to love?
l am older than him and
he thinks that l am more
educated and richer than him.
Don't you know him?
Of course l do
Actually you know me too.
He is now 21 and
l am 27.
Both we are young,
there'd be fine.
But after twenty years,
he is only 41 and l am already 47.
Another thirty years, you are
77 and he also will reach 7 1 .
l think you guys
shouldn't worry too much
about your future.
Otherwise
you will keep worrying about
your future endlessly.
lt would be wise to enjoy
the moment you are
with him now.
Although l don't understand,
we are going to keep
our love forever.
Cheers.
