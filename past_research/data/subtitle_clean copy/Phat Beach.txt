- no, dad, i--
you know,
i remember my first job back in college-- milking cows.
not very glamorous,
but taught me to respect the dollar.
i thought this summer i'd just take a poetry class.
no, you're gonna have plenty of time
for poetry back in school next fall.
- this summer it's work. physical, manual work.
- but, dad--
nothing like physical work,
especially for a boy in your shape.
get you moving a little bit.
but, dad, only 10 people
got accepted to this class.
benjamin, writin' didn't buy this car.
hard work did.
every time i sit behind the wheel,
i feel like i can conquer the world.
i want you to know
that feeling, son.
- yeah?
- yeah.
so i could drive
the car now?
get that "conquering the world" feeling going.
i can even drive it to work,
'cause my bike is broke.
you ain't gonna conquer nothin' in my car.
take your sister's bike.
- but, dad, that's a girl's bike!
- who'll know?
- jesus, durrel! turn that shit down!

what did he
give you?
"love to be in love,
to dream,
"to understand your dreams
and shout from the rooftops
that you have found
the one you love."
- (laughing)
- wow.
i think that's
really eloquent.
well, if that means
stupid, i agree.
you guys are coldhearted.
he's a really nice guy.
- not like his friend durrel.
- both: durrel?
benny says he's scamming
all the time.
yeah, i'm leavin' for the army tomorrow.

i've been looking
for you all day.
- oh, really?

so, um, i thought
i wasn't your type.
oh, come on.
that was just talk.
i didn't think you'd give up so easily.
so, um, what are you
doing tonight?
- whatever you are, baby.
- (giggles)
well, then,
what do you say
we go for a nice,
long ride along the coast?
i'd do anything for just a nice,
relaxing ride.

quiver all over
just thinking
about it.
benny! benny, man.
i've been lookin' all over for you!

- i'm just thinkin', man.
i needs to borrow
the car tonight.
- what?
- i need to borrow the car. it's life or death!
- no.
- don't make me beg, man.
get out of my face, durrel.
i'll get on my knees and beg
like a little baby dog.
durrel, read my lips.
you're not touching my dad's car!
but it's this girl, man.
- i think i really like her.
- yeah, you like her, huh?
like her enough to bounce
her on your dick?
no, man, i'm talkin' serious.
and i can get her if i--
- lie to her and tell her you got a nice car?
- no, it's not like that.
- she don't care if i drive a bicycle.
- is that right?
well, you'd better get yourself a schwinn,
'cause i can't help you.
remember love, man?
you told me you were in love today.
i'd do anything to help you get that girl.
so help me.
you know how you don't like me abusing women.
this'll stop me.
i got a problem, man.
help me, benny. save me.
you don't like this girl.
i think this could be the only
girl i'm ever with again, ever.
- you're lying.
- i'm serious!
- who is she then?
- met her at the beach.
this shit is amazing.
we both come down here
and fall in love
in the same day.
what happened
with your girl?
i just gave her this poem
that i wrote for her.
ah! aggressive.
what'd she say?
i don't know.
i ran away.
- you ran away?
- isn't it amazing?
she's gonna be sitting there
wondering for the rest of her life
what her life
could've been like
with this mysterious poet
she met on the beach, man.
don't take much
to please you, does it?
(sighs)
all right, durrel.
one of us might
as well get the girl.
but don't be fuckin'
in it!
- here.
- i owe you big-time.
yeah, you do. we're leaving first thing in the morning,
come hell or high water.
hey. here.

- relax, my man.
i'm not looking for him.
i'm lookin' for that girl that he's with.
i don't know about her,
but durrel's pretty much into her.
hopefully not before
i'm into her,
if you know what
i'm sayin'.
- no.
- me and your boy put a bet down.
who could, you know,
wax that ass first.
a bet?
durrel doesn't even have anything to bet.

against my $300.
his box?

mr. peppy's day wouldn't have been so long and hard
if mr. peppy
hadn't forgot the map.
let's just go to sleep,
wake up in the morning and
forget this trip ever happened.
oh, but, baby,
it hasn't been that bad.
it's been real bad.
benny: how could you be so stupid
to park in a handicapped zone?
- don't yell at me.
- well, why did you park there then?
man, i didn't know handicapped people go dancing.
you think it's all a joke.
well, now you know they go dancing!
- benny: and--
- durrel: and?
benny: and we ain't got no money for food
and i'm hungry and we ain't
got no money to get the car.
jesus christ!
