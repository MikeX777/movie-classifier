Noon wants to go some place,
Noon will make me go too
Noon, do you still remember

I think Noon cross the line
If you feel that way,

It may be better that way
You think the string will tear down
Afraid

We don't have to scare anything forever

The outcome is the same... eating fish.
It's all you can think. That's it.
Nowadays people think more
about the outcome than how to.

Is it leaning just like the
Leaning Tower of Pizza?
Yes
You're good too.
I know.
Have you been there?
No
One day I will go there
What to go for?
Just for a make believe picture
that you 're carrying the tower?
Like this?
Go left.. a bit more.. Like this?
Just to see why it doesn't fall.
Right.. a bit more
Up, up, ok

Umm... ok
You should go finish your school.
Admit your mistake and start again.
it's a waste.
I am not wrong. Why admit?
What's not wrong?
fraud teacher's signature?
wrong for sure
I understand that is a harsh punishment.
But wrong is wrong.
one day people will know
that I am not wrong.
It will take time to proof yourself.
Like Galileo
He said Earth is not
the center of the universe
They put him in jail. And now
Every one knows Galileo is right.
But you... are wrong.
Make a mistake.. accept it
That's common rule
common rule...
What is his common rule?
Let's go to Pizza in April.
Why April?
for Song-graan festival?
I want to celebrate your
birthday with Galileo.

So we start from 200
Here we have 50
150, you're sold out 150,
4 euro each
It's 600 euro
You gave me 580
so the different is 20 euro
I have to take it from your money
Please just one mistake
It'll never happen again.
I'm sorry. These are the rule.
It's not that beautiful.
I didn't buy for you.
What you're gonna do?
If the com stop working.
Use the phone
Would you like a Gondola trip?
Yes but it is so expensive.
I have a way.
We go buy the same kind of box.
Then use our boxes to sell
That is cheating.
We won't do that many.
May be 10 a day
Fabricio won't get poor.
This is the last time that
we will spend time together
You cheated at the subway
station before
It is not the same.
That... We don't know who we
cheat but here... it's Fabricio.
You really can do it?
Nothing happen in the past.
Don't think too much.
It's not about getting away,
It's about right or wrong.
Then... I'll do it.
Tomorrow you switch to sell
the ice cream.
That would be weird.
What do you want? You don't want to do it.
And you won't let me do it.
ok? Just one last time.
Only this time
You have to promise
not to cheat again.
I promise.
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
