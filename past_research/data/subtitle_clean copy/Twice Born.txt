- Hello '?
- Ma-may I speak with Gemma '?
- This is Gemma.
- Gemma '? Gemma, is that really you '?
- Gojko '?
- Yes, Gemma. It's me.
- My Gojko '?
- Your Gojko.
Who called so early this morning '?
Gojko.
From Sarajevo.
He's been trying to reach me
for months, through the Embassy.
They're organizing a show,
to commemorate the Siege.
He asked me to go.
Some of Diego's photos will be in it.
I have to go to the office,
I have a ton of work to do.
I can't just leave like this.
I don't know...
Of course you know.
Pietro will never come with me.
But it's a chance for him too.
Here.
Gojko!
- He's still alive.
- He's always been alive.
Mom.
Let's go, Mom.
Pietro I
- Beautiful woman !
- Old woman. - Fuck off !
- You are a rocker.
- I'm a joker.
You liked it '?
- Very much.
- Is there any ice cream '?
- Yeah there is a corner.
How do you say "ice cream"
in Bosnia '? - "Sladoled".
- Chokolada, vanila... - If I just
say ice cream will they understand me'?
Ok. Can I have some money,
please '?
- Wait. Here.
Thank you !
- He's a good kid.
- He's like his father.
Call me, Gemma, any time.
I sleep sitting up...
because if I'm lying down I can feel
my heart in my eyes.
It was easier to run through the
grenades that to walking on ruins.
Gemma '7?
I'm Gojko, your guide.
So, you're doing some research on...
Oh, on Andric.
Yes, for my thesis.
- So, do you have a good place to
stay '? - Yes, a guesthouse. I'm fine.
Don't worry because you could sleep
under a bridge on the Miljacka,
nobody would bother you.
There's not a drunk or thief to be
found these days, you know.
Communist cleanup.
This is the first time we are baring
our ass to the world.
Please.
Olympic Games are about to start
and we have no snow, so,
I'm a little bit worrying.
- Look, I'm here to study Andric s
work. - Ah...
I need someone who can take me to
places related to his life in Bosnia.
Maybe you're not the right person.
I have a car I
- What are you doing '?
- No, no, no. Don't worry.
It's German. The Germans do their
assembly work here, they trust us.
And you want to know why'?
Because we are so precise.
Okay, so maybe we are not so precise
but we sure are cheap.
I pay you very well.
You must be a real whore.
- What '?
- You must be a real whore.
Stop. Stop the car I
What the fuck are you trying to teach
me '? What are you, Italian professor?
Poetry is the art
that listens to human life.
She's crazy I
Poetry... Poetry is God when he feels
nostalgia for men.
It's difficult to translate poetry.
'Alum mo. I
a fist-full of earth falling,
as the gravedigger swears, spits."
Please Gemma, get in.
It's not my car, a friend lent it
to me. I give him half my pay.
Please, please get in,
enough of this.
You bring good luck.
Beautiful Italian woman I
What was the poem about'?
A gravedigger.
He has to bury a poet,
and he curses and smokes
on his grave.
- And spits.
- Yes... yes and spits
I understood something.
It's pronounced just like
it's written,
and the words agree
with others close to them.
For example, if there is a feminine
noun, everything else becomes feminine.
We are very gallant, you know '?
You got married '?
- Yeah.
- Tell me, what is she like '?
I was lucky.
What about the house in Monte
Trebevic'? Is it still there '?
It's covered with mines but...
if you want we can go up there
together and get blown up.
Guys, guys !
Your attention, please.
Let me introduce my Italian friend.
Gemma, this is Zoran, a great mime.
Also known as Kafka.
His father, our local philosopher,
also known as Kant.
This is Bojan, our amazing
saxophone player.
Come on here. Let me introduce to
my Italian friend,
this is Diego, photographer,
American friend. Diego.
â€œUnequal
This is Mladio, a great sculptor
and he's the craziest of us.
The great actress Ana
A woman everybody wants
and many have had.
I spent the whole day lying in the
snow with skiers jumping over me,
ice chips flying in my eyes.
I'm probably going to go blind. It's
not a great idea for a photographer
But I don't understand why you didn't
wear sunglasses.
Dammit!
No, that's like making love
with your clothes on.
Nothing can come between you
and the lens.
Here.
God that laugh.
- Are you seeing someone '?
- I have been someone for many years.
- What about you '?
- Me '?
I'm free I
I'm free !
Drop everything and run away with me.
Mmhm, where to '?
Brasil. Photograph children
who work in these mines in Camaru.
I was going to leave tomorrow.
I was so happy,
but now I'm so sad.
I'm also leaving tomorrow.
- Excuse me, Mirna Mari '?
- Room 13.
"Mama" '?
"Mama..."
May I take her '?
Be careful with her head.
Allow me to introduce myself,
young lady.
I'm your brother, Gojko.
And I'll also be your father,
in the memory of our recently
departed dad.
What is it '?
My mother wants to thank you
for giving me work.
Very good.
She asked if you'd like to hold
the baby.
Oh, she is so sweet.
So small.
Do you want children'?
Now"?
It's all I want.
Come on, Come on,
Welcome to my house.
Principessa italiana can sleep here.
You, photographer
you will sleep in my room.
Don't worry, sheets are clean enough,
and I'll sleep on the couch.
- Tell me.
- Our poet has fallen asleep.
- Okay, good night.
- No, I'm in love with you.
- You are crazy. - I, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.
- Okay. How old are you '?
- Twenty-three.
OWN-Obi
Nice poem, Gojko, congratulations.
Alana.
No!Go!
Oh God I
And now you're mine.
Till!!!"-
There's a trattoria nearby,
I used to bring you mother there.
They make such a carbonara...
Let's run away.
I'm happy, Dad I I'm convinced.
And the other one, the American '?
The night caller '?
- There's no one else.
- Then... no carbonara.
' Mum.
- You're crazy, crazy. - I told you
I'd be in Rome in no time.
You cannot stay here. This is my
father's house. I just got divorced.
Yes I
That's okay. I can take care of myself
I already got a place to stay anyway.
- Armando '?
- Diego ! How was your trip, Diego '?
Oh, it was great !
I took your advice.
- I followed a road, the...
- Aurelia ! - Aureelia, yeah.
I got a present for you.
It's from my childhood,
from when I was a baby.
Hey, look, I haven't changed a bit,
it still fits.
My ass is the same size.
You happy to see me '?
Yes '? Maybe '?
Maybe just a little bit '?
- Oh.
- Diego ! Some coffee.
- Diego. You are a photographer '?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm a photographer.
Eh, you work in weddings,
advertising '?
- Puddles mostly.
- Puddles. Yeah.
- Interesting, eh '?
May I have the honor of taking your
daughter off to dinner tonight'?
Of course, Diego.
WWII
WWII
But do you think I really want
to live here'?
No, it belongs to a friend,
a guy I met in Brazil.
This way.
All for you my love.
Come on.
What perfume are you wearing '?
Juniper shower gel.
Sit.
Sorry, I forgot
my dress shirts at home.
- These are cemetery candles. - It's
all they had at the supermarket.
- When did you take these photos '?
- Did you forget '?
Have you thought about what
to do for a living '?
There's lots of little old ladies that
need a nice portrait for tombstone.
- That won't take us very far.
- No, but we're already here.
Everyday will be a party with me baby.
I promise.
How can you always be so happy '?
I can't stand being sad.
I love you Gemma.
- The night at Gojkds house '?
- Yeah.
I got pregnant.
Jesus Christ, Gemma.
And you didn't even tell me'?
I lost it immediately.
It never even had a heartbeat.
It was lifeless,
like a blind eye.
My grandmother was blind.
She was a schoolteacher.
One day she was riding her bike
and she fell in the river.
My grandfather fished her out.
He was younger than her, and they spent
the rest of their lives together.
The weirdest love stories
are always the best.
This, right here,
this is the spot you know.
This is where everything comes from,
where everything's born.
It's our destiny, you know.
The river of life
The river of life.
You want to know the truth '?
He looks like you
He walks like you
and he's moody like you.
- Did I ever tell you how much I was
in love with you'? - You never did.
But you two were so in love.
You were so in love with him.
Pietro, be careful I
Is this Diego's '?
It's nice !
It looks like a cool CD cover.
- No, I don't think it's your dad's.
- Dad '?
What a drag with this story I
The first photo of your son.
Sorry you could not take it yourself.
Pietro I
- I love him already.
- Diego, we have no money.
No,no,no!
Today I got paid.
You can't ride a motor scooter anymore.
And you... You have to listen
to Mozar, Beethoven, Bach !
Pink Floyd. No I
Pink Floyd. No I
You're a mother now, a temple
and I'm a monk
who kneels before you.
Come on, son, faster.
Time for a new life.
You need to take care
of your body now.
No more alcohol, no more cigarettes
and no more pot.
Enough!
- Italian Fascist !
- Shut up !
A spineless American,
that's what you are I
- There, smoke, smoke ! - How did you
manage to win all those wars '?
Shit I
it was a blighted ovum,
the body expels them naturally.
You were lucky.
The hemorrhage saved you from a D&C.
What did he say '?
He said I was lucky.
Just means it wasn't Pietro, sweetie.
The children who are meant to come,
will come. Gemma, they'll come.
Look ! Oh, get some fresh air in here.
Look, this is our bedroom.
Really sweet, look.
Oh, and a dark room, a perfect dark
room or maybe even a nursery.
Got a music room or maybe
even a dance hall.
God, so much space, so spacious,
the windows.
Look over here too.
Slip and slide.
Behind you is the kitchen.
It's our new life, Gemma
My love.
I'll be right here honey I'm not going
anywhere 0k '? Think about me !
Think about us 0k '?
I love you Gemma, I love you.
You're my sparkling Gemma
little flower bud !
WWII
- I'll make it this time!
- Good morning, Gemma.
Don't worry, Gemma,
relax
and think about something
beautiful, think about the sea.
I'm so sorry I'm late there was
so much fucking traffic.
Beautiful.
Sally.
I'm afraid that your eggs are
incompatible with life.
Your sterility factor is rated at 97%.
We consider that total sterility.
What about the 3% '?
Miracles I
Miracles do happen.
This is Italy after all.
You can live also without children,
Gemma.
Adoption is a lengthy process,
a real ordeal for the mind and soul.
The last test of your shortcomings.
As your psychologist
my responsibility
is to discourage you.
Having a child has become
an obsession.
I see pregnant women everywhere,
They are like an army walking
towards me.
Do you really want me to be honest '?
I'm not here to prove to you
that I am a good person.
I'm here because I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of losing the man I love.
I want to give him a child
to tie him to me
with this padlock of flesh.
What does truth taste like'?
Awful.
Better.
When my father beat my mother
I'd go hide in the closet.
I'd just keep telling myself
"Think about something beautiful".
I'd piss in my pants.
But I wouldn't come off until
I heard my mother washing her face
and going into the kitchen
and start frying eggs.
And then I'd come off and smile
as if to say,
"it's 0k ma'. I didn't hear a thing,
all I saw was a beautiful thing".
When my father died,
when they lifted up the container
there wasn't really anything
it was just a puddle of shrimp
marmalade and my father floating in it.
That was when I took
my first photograph.
And then I started using heroine.
Heroine was a beautiful thing, it was
a thing that took away all the pain.
All of a sudden soccer fields
seemed like the MaracanÃ£ stadium
and my ugly mug didn't seem so bad.
And then I met Gemma.
The only, truly beautiful thing
in my life.
I want a child with his eyes,
with his neck.
Do you think there is a child like
that somewhere'?
The police has given a negative
evaluation.
Your criminal record Diego,
the drugs and all the rest,
there was nothing I could do.
Your request has been refused.
I'm sorry.
I'm just...
I'm so sorry.
It couldn't have happened to a more
deserving couple.
Hey, how are you'? Are you 0k '?
What do you need '?
A case of Brunello di Montalcino.
- Gojko, senti, how are you,
how is Sebina'?
Ah, Sebina is fine, she's always
jumping all over the place.
Listen put her on a plane,
send her to us.
No, no, relax, there is no war here.
No one will ever touch Sarajevo.
Did you like the photos '?
Were you there '?
Were you always with him '?
Not always.
- And where was I '?
- You weren't born yet.
- Weren't you scared '?
- Of what '?
You were pregnant. Weren't you scared
of being pregnant in a war '?
My shoes are wet !
I've caught a cold.
Legs up I Shake them fast.
Make the lights flicker.
Let's change position, the other way.
Fast, fast I
One day you'll find somebody
with good ovaries,
someone young and healthy
and you'll have a child with her.
What the fuck are you talking about'?
I'll bring you little presents,
I'll play the aunt.
Shoes with lights...
And I'll forgive you
because I care for you too much.
Well, I don't "care" for you too much,
I love you.
We have to learn to live
without children.
- It's easy for you to say.
- No. It's not.
Diego you can have a child whenever
you want, with whoever you want.
Fine I'll get spade, like a cat.
I don't know what the fuck to do
with my balls anymore anyway.
I mean I'm sick of earning money
for nothing.
I'm of no use to you any more,
I don't know how to make you happy.
Are you fucking the stylist?
Maybe we should split up.
- Bye kids !
- Bye !
So it's true that,
life speaks through light.
You know who we'll take these to '?
So guys.
This is the radio station.
I do a night poetry show.
I fuck like a mule these days.
- Hey. Kafka! (off) What's up!
- Diego, I have something for you !
Hello Ana.
It's our communal house.
Come on, what did you cook
for my friends, mama'?
My mom is the great cook!
It's plenty of electricity, you know.
You're wonderful I
Beautiful, Sebina.
This way we will always be able
to find you,
even in the dark.
She is not studying at all, she is all
the time training at the gym.
She wants to become
next Nadia Comaneci.
Son of a bitch I Do I always have
to listen to him '? Turn it off!
How can every anyone be afraid
of an ass like him '?
It's the assholes you have
to be afraid of.
He changed the menus in the
restaurants the street names!
For them it's enough to fart and they
think their ass in supporting them.
Yeah, the propaganda people, first
come propaganda and then history.
No, it's one thing to... convince
a peasant that his Turkish neighbor
wants to cut his throat,
but there aren't any Turks here
or Cetnics, or Ustascia.
Yeah that's what I'm talking about,
because here we are all Sarajevans !
- Poets, artists, lawyers.
- Wars start in the villages.
- Wars start in the soccer stadiums,
while you guys haul yourselves up
in artist's colonies and write poetry.
- But you're not scared '?
- We are together.
That's what matters.
Ah, ja.
What is the smell like '?
Milk.
Or the forest.
They are both biologists, he is
professor, she was his assistant.
They rent off a room and he's a jew,
she's a muslim
but don't worry you'll be comfortable.
Welcome. Please take off your shoes.
Good morning.
Do you have international newspapers '?
Newspaper '? Yes !
Thank you. "Le Monde".
How are you, Professor '?
And when are you two going
to have a baby
Come on, the yankee can't '?
If you need a little help, c'mon,
here I am.
I'm sterile, Gojko.
Sterile.
Beautiful woman...
We are a luckless generation.
I wanted a child with these feet.
I wanted to see him walking in front
of us.
I lost.
- Why don't you come too '?
- Do you like her '? - No.
I like Italian girls!
- Let's go, Pietro.
- Come on. - Go, go.
Leave her alone, we will have fun,
the three of us. Let's go.
Be careful on the slides I
Be careful I
MW!
You be careful too.
- Who's that girl '? - Kurt Kobain.
- Kurt Kobain '?
And who the heck is that '?
- Do you like Nirvana'? I listen
to them in the dark every night.
They blow me away.
- Where exactly do they blow you to '?
- Somewhere you'll never go.
- Idiot !
- Fuck you!
Nirvana is just a bunch of fucking
nihilist millionaires.
- Screw you !
- Shut up !
So what are your intentions, Aska?
To play music.
One of the guys in Nirvana is Croatian.
If he made it, so can I.
I want to go to London.
That's why I need the money.
Gojko told me
you are looking for a roda, a stork.
I want to be paid in deutsche marks.
- Will you do it only for money '?
- What do you want me to say '?
That I'm doing it for love '?
- Are you muslim '?
- Sometimes I read the Koran.
And what does the Koran say '? You can
rent your body to another woman '?
The Koran says to help other people
I'm happy to help a woman
who's defective.
We all have to give something back.
If you think about it, even the Virgin
Mary lent her womb to God the Father.
Aska doesn't exactly strike
my as the Virgin Mary.
Every once in a while God points
his finger at someone and says
"You, come with me."
You can't say no to God.
He plants himself inside of us,
opens our soul.
Kurt Kobain does drugs
so he can deal with God.
How can I be sure you,
you won't decide to keep the baby '?
Easy. Families make me sick.
Downhill"
My test results.
No, I don't have AIDS.
Hi.
My boyfriend and I can't have
intercourse,
I have these bad muscle spasms so,
it's basically impossible, you know.
- Muscle spasms.
- Artificial insemination.
Yeah, that. Whatever you call it.
We have to do some tests first
in order to monitor your ovulation
and then your partner
will have to...
Doctor...
I'm sorry...
We have to go.
Everybody is running away !
What's up '? Where are you going '?
Where the fuck are you going '?
Cowards, traitors, motherfuckers I
Your mother is a bitch I
Get out, son of a bitch I
What's happening, guys '?
Where is everybody going '?
Fuck you, assholes !
Go, run away !
Motherfuckers, get out of town !
- How about a hot chocolate at my
place '?
LISP-
Thank you, grandmother.
If you want we can do it naturally,
you know '?
I don't have problems with sex.
You can watch if you want.
Like in a laboratory
Zic, zic, zic, zik...
Like rabbits I
Hey what's so fucking funny you two'?
What the fuck.
No!
I don't think so.
She's not going to come.
Good morning.
I don't know if you remember,
I was here with my husband,
before the war,
he was a photographer.
A lot of photographers came here I
May I take a look around '?
Of course. Please.
Who are you '? Their maid of honor '?
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
It's a zoo off there
with the demonstrations and all.
Let's hope I still have
a few eggs left.
Are you staying '?
No.
Bye.
So are they fucking those two '?
"And the life laughs at us
like a toothless old whore
while we fuck her
with our eyes closed,
dreaming of the ass of lilly."
Do I stink '?
No.
You smell good.
Let's go make love
once before we die.
