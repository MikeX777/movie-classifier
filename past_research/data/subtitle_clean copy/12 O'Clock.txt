- Where are you going?
- None of your business.
All this while everything
you did was my business.
Now it's not?
Anyway, tell me why you are going.
What is wrong?
Ask your heart before asking me.
l only know that after
your uncle's demise...
We gave you every possible luxury.
- And fulfilled all your wishes.
- Oh yes, you did!
l wanted to study.
You made me give up college.
Made me beg for every penny.
Meet this one, don't meet that..
This is good and that is bad.
Taunted me all the time!
ls this what you call
the luxury you gave me?
That's not my fault.
l followed your sister's orders.
Sure. You are a wax doll.
You can be moulded anyway.
- You do everything sister says.
- You're crossing limits.
Create a new problem everyday!
- l'll have to complain to her.
- She too is dead for me!
She hasn't written to me once since
she went to Bombay 7 months ago.
l don't want to see your faces!
lt's you? Come in.
lt's late night. These bags..?
- Had another row?
- Yes.
l've left that house.
Now l'll never go back.
You don't have to. l always
told you to come and stay here.
You'll be away from him
and my time will pass.
- But you..
- l'd have come long ago.
But l was waiting to find a job.
- Job...?
- Yes, uncle. l've got a job.
l begin work tomorrow.
Great! You're my true niece.
Who stands on her own.
Gentlemen, you have honoured me
by electing me Managing Director.
l thank you for the same.
l hope you will help me in
culminating this job at the earliest.
We can offer you very little help.
And we have no knowledge
about the hotel industry.
Don't you worry.
l assure you our hotels will soon
be the talk of the entire nation.
We mustn't delay
depositing the money.
lt's best to begin
work at the earliest.
My investment is nominal.
Take it anytime you wish.
Mr. Rai is the one who has to
arrange for the maximum capital.
Don't worry. lt will be
arranged within the month.
All right, we'll take leave.
We'll meet later.
That's terrific. Mind blowing.
You haven't seen the
earlier dancer here.
She'd make you forget everything.
- These days where is she?
- She's on a break.
Permit us to leave. lt's late.
- So early?
- You're independent.
Your wife is out of town. But
we have to face the home government.
- Okay.
- Good night.
Take a seat.
- Yes?
- Regarding my case...
- The next date is December.
- Thank you.
- The fees..
- Don't worry about money.
Find some loophole to
defeat Tolaram Damdimal.
Don't worry. Arrange for
the money and all will be done.
The money will reach court tomorrow.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Don't forget.
- No.
- He must be defeated.
- Yes, it will be done.
Your name?
Understood. Divorce case.
- Your husband's name?
- Pardon?
You've written it down.
Shy? Give that to me.
You're the new Secretary?
Follow me.
This is your seat.
- Have you worked before this?
- No.
l'll make you perfect in 2 days.
First arrange these letters
case wise in these files.
This is...murder.
File 302.
This case is of rioting.
Number 147.
This is cheating.
One man needed everywhere!
Does it hurt you to
address me by my full name?
Do consider our old
friendship and my position.
Why did you call me?
This is Court Session
and that is flat F 2.
A 40 year old bald man lives here.
Do l have to tweak
his son's hair?
Let me complete.
This man is blackmailing
the Parsi who just left.
l want you to go there and find
out where he goes, what he does.
- Get that? - Yes.
- Take this.
- Shall l go tomorrow?
- Don't be daft. Hurry.
And send the secretary in.
You're being called.
A problem everyday!
Follow this one or that.
Follow this lame or that blind.
Go there in the night
and come here in the day.
what a pain! Now he wants
me to follow a bald man!
l'm fed up of this job.
Put me on duty elsewhere.
You're very impatient. Why don't
you think there's no place better...
...than this to find out
about the gang of smugglers.
You can see the flat clearly
and Ajay is your childhood friend.
So you have every liberty.
What liberty? l haven't
seen a movie for 3 months!
This lawyer is comparable
to Scotland Yard.
He's got the problems of the world!
And l'm the one who faces the music!
Have you no shame
pulling down my sari?
l didn't pull it down.
lt was drawn to me.
She fell into my arms
the moment she saw me.
- Whose is it?
- Mine.
Yours? Will you punish it?
Not right to be generous to others.
Forgive me.
l scolded you by mistake.
- Do you always make such mistakes?
- Pardon?
Sometimes.
You scolded me now. When will
you make the mistake of being nice?
- Pardon...
- Answer me.
What are you doing here?
l was being scolded and
she was making mistakes.
My dear, he's a gentleman.
Don't make a mistake with him.
This is Bani, my niece and
he is Ajay, an advocate.
A famous lawyer of the city.
- Glad to meet you.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Let's play some chess.
- Sure.
- Come along.
l'm glad we met.
The evening will pass.
Bani can't play chess!
lt requires brains.
Otherwise she's very bright.
She's private secretary to a lawyer.
ls that so?
My sympathies to the lawyer.
Here you are.
So that's your game.
Want to win the game?
No question. l've lost
in the very first move.
This is a very dangerous game.
One move decides the entire game.
Yes. Save yourself.
You are being checked.
l see that.
Make your move.
Here you are.
Your good name?
My name is...
- What is your case?
- What can l say?
My landlord gave me
notice to leave the house.
- He can't sleep.
- Why?
- His heart gets a jolt.
- You give it?
l only dance.
- You dance?
- Yes.
l'll give you a demonstration.
- That's quite enough.
- Did you like it?
l'm feeling great.
But my landlord doesn't like it.
- l'll talk to him. You may leave.
- Really?
- Should l leave?
- Yes, go.
- Good day sir.
- Goodbye.
What about your case?
ls this the time to come?
ls this the time to come to
office? lt's 2 minutes past 10.30.
The court doesn't believe in sorry.
lf you are late, the work won't
be done and he'll be hanged!
And who will save him
if he is hanged?
You or your apology?
Forget the apology.
We have lots of work.
Have you bought all your papers?
Given it up.
l can see everything.
l thought you can only
see girls through this.
- Can't see men.
- What do you mean?
The secretary is very nice.
The first day she captured
the office, the next,the heart.
Don't bore me.
My getting bored is fine but
it shouldn't reach a stage...
..that you get bored of clients.
Here's your mail and
this is your personal letter.
lt's inside.
Enclosed is your fees; Rs. 200.
lt's not right to come to your office.
Hence be kind enough to meet me
in Hotel Majestic this evening.
l'll be wearing a white sari.
Did you write this letter to me?
l am Mrs. Kapoor. And you..?
l'm Ajay Kumar and this is
Bani Choudhary, my Secretary.
- Would you like something?
- No thanks.
- You wrote..
- l troubled you because...
For the past three years,
my husband's property...
You have some anger.
That day you didn't let me speak.
Has the temper cooled down?
Trunk call from Delhi.
Stay here, l'll get back.
Don't go away.
- How are you?
- Very well but dying to meet you.
l want to come back. lt's
so hot here that l can't live.
l was thinking of leaving
by the morning train.
l have to come to Delhi for
business in a day or two.
Can't you stay there
for a couple of days?
We could return together.
The journey will be fun.
l'll stay back if you say so.
But l hope l won't
be waiting in vain.
And make some excuse like always.
Such impatience!
No, darling l will come.
Then l'll wait for you.
Don't worry. l've heard the case.
- l'll start investigation tomorrow
- Thank you. Good bye.
What are you doing here?
l'm always here.
Where are you?
Right here but have no spare time.
l see that.
- Did you make this?
- Yes. Like it?
Keep it.
My studio is two feet
away from your office.
Come over sometime.
He's a good man.
- He's quite a fool.
- Sure.
Since when do you know him?
He's your friend...
how will l know?
But he has made a nice case.
- l'm not talking about you.
- Who else?
That man who kept
talking to you for hours.
Him...he...
- That was Ram Mohan.
- Know him for long?
Yes, from childhood.
Very handsome man.
Of course. He's a businessman.
Why didn't you answer him?
- l'm not talking to him.
- Why?
That's between us.
Why should you ask?
Why are you quiet?
Why should you ask?
l came to wish you good night.
You've come!
What's the matter? Come in.
This is my friend, Khanna.
He was on the same flight.
- This is my wife, Maya.
- Hello. Please come in.
Excuse me. l must keep
my bags in my room.
- Are you staying in this hotel?
- Yes. Room 302.
Why don't you have lunch with us?
What do you say, darling?
- How is Bani?
- She's fine.
She's very bad. She hasn't
answered a single letter of mine.
You know how careless she is.
She must have forgotten.
Let me see her. Then l'll show her.
When do we leave?
l have some work here.
Then l'll book the seats.
- What work do you have here?
- l need money for business.
You won't give me a
penny from your inheritance.
And l have to beg from others.
You're saying strange things. Dad's
money is meant for something specific.
Then how can l give it?
All right have it your way.
Anyway l've made arrangements.
lt's 10 o'clock.
That man must be waiting for me.
l must leave.
l'll be back by lunch.
- Grab a bite.
- lt's an important appointment.
l'll be back by lunch.
Listen, book our tickets.
- How are you?
- Ayah, go out.
Maya is going to Bombay.
You must accompany her.
Here's your ticket.
Your seats are in
the same compartment.
Take care to keep
the child with Maya.
She loves kids because
she can't have them.
- But...
- No buts, darling.
The moment the train reaches Dadar,
leave the child and disembark.
And... be careful.
l don't know why l'm scared.
For no reason, a life...
This is life. One must
use one's head not heart.
After some days, your
son will own millions.
And you...you will be mine.
You invited me and came late.
Forgive me for the delay.
Please.
- Booked the seats?
- No darling.
l have to go to Calcutta.
The man l had to meet
has gone to Calcutta.
Why must you go there?
l have important work. l must
meet him or my work will suffer.
Must l rot here?
l'll book your ticket.
Why don't you return alone?
By the time your train reaches
Bombay, l'll be there by air.
Why don't you put her
on the train tomorrow?
- l can do that.
- l think that's a good arrangement.
- What do you say?
- As you wish.
Don't pull a long face now.
l'll be in Bombay with you.
What are you checking?
Taking a look at what
you've hidden in this purse.
You won't find anything
that belongs to your office.
lf l find something
from my house...?
What do you have in
your house worth stealing?
Half of it is broken
the rest covered in dust.
You are right. There's nothing
in my house. lt is desolate.
And l live in it, lost...
How did you fall sick?
- Thanks to you.
- How come?
- Walking with you.
- Then don't.
- Going to ask for permission?
- Who are they to give permission?
- Then why are you going?
- l have some work.
- What?
- Tell you later.
This is a map of platform 5.
According to you, Maya's
compartment is the third.
l'll bring her there
under some pretext.
We will stand here.
There is a bench just here.
You stand on this bench.
lt will be easy for you.
But keep one thing in mind.
The moment the train halts and
your job is done, you must jump off.
A taxi will be waiting for
you. lt's number is 5500
- 5500. Get it?
- Yes.
Here's your money.
Take this. You mustn't miss.
Khanna never misses.
Madam is coming with
the child tonight.
Take the car and bring her.
Since nobody is home, in the
meantime, l'll arrange everything.
But sir, Bani has come home.
- What?
- She's sitting inside.
Are you well?
Hmmm. l'm glad you've
gotten over the anger.
Where's your luggage?
l've come for the money uncle
willed to me, not to stay here.
You're so smart.
Found your own groom.
- Tell me about him.
- lt's none of your concern!
l only want to know the name of the
young man who captured this lioness.
l haven't come to crack jokes.
l want my money.
Whose joking? You know only
your sister can give the money.
She's coming by the
midnight train. Meet her.
- Where are you going?
- To the station to meet her.
l too am going there.
Twenty five minutes to go.
What movie is playing here?
Good gracious! He's dead!
What a terrible accident!
The law is not with you.
Tell us truthfully,
who your partner is.
l have no partner.
l don't know anybody!
- How much did you pay him?
- l didn't pay anyone! l've nobody.
How many times must l say,
l didn't kill my sister?
Why don't you call Mr. Ajay?
Constable, take her away.
Don't bore me! ls this
some time to wake me up?
Do you know Miss Bani Choudhary?
Yes. She's my secretary.
She's been arrested for murder.
- Whose murder?
- Her sister's.
l didn't kill anyone.
l'd gone to the station
with my brother-in-law.
l don't know how the
pistol landed in my purse.
lt went off.
l didn't commit the murder.
l didn't kill!
l'll look after everything.
But tell me the truth.
- What? Don't you believe me?
- My believing won't help.
Till you are proven innocent.
Now tell me where you got the pistol.
l don't know!
Where did you go after leaving me?
Straight to brother-in-law's house
Then on to get my sister.
Sister? You never
told me she was coming.
l didn't know. Her husband told me.
- Whom else did you meet?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Don't worry. l'll free you.
But l still can't believe
Bani is capable of murder.
Only because she's
your friend's beloved?
No. l know her quite well.
- She's a simple girl.
- That's a personal opinion.
But if she's really committed
a murder, do you know your duty?
Yes, l do.
The bullet found in Mrs. Rai
Mohan's body was NOT fired from this.
- Drive slowly.
- Why?
Something will happen.
This guy had the
same disease as you.
l mean he wanted to go home in
a hurry but went to God's abode.
lf he wanted to die with Rs. 5500,
he could've willed it to me.
The cash that went to a government
bank would have come to em.
Right. The man resembles me.
- You resemble a monkey.
- Grapes?
- Monkey!
- l thought grape.
Monkey.
But yet my wife and l loved Bani.
l don't understand.
Why did Bani do this crazy thing?
Who was it who fired
the second bullet?
Second bullet?
What are you saying?
Yes, your wife was shot twice.
Only one shot was fired
from Bani's pistol.
- But who could that be?
- That's what we want to know.
But if there was another person...
Somebody at the station
would have seen him.
No.
Do you only suspect Bani?
As long as Bani lived with us
l never saw her meet anyone...
But after leaving us,
obviously l don't know.
You'd mentioned earlier that
Bani was quite quarrelsome.
Did your wife and
Bani ever have a fight?
Small arguments take place
in every family.
But no major fights.
As far as l know.
Did Bani ever come
here after she left?
Just once.
That too the night
she shot her sister.
Why had she come?
She knows best.
But she told me
she'd come for money.
..which her uncle willed to her.
Will...May l see it?
Sure. l'll get it.
Here you are.
This is the will which
hides the secret of the murder.
lt clearly says...
My only daughter Maya is
the sole heir to my property.
And her children after her demise.
But if Maya dies childless...
My niece Bani inherits everything.
Now l shall prove that Bani
murdered Maya for the property.
When she shot at Maya,
she had no clue...
The true heir to the
property had been born!
How many bullets hit Maya?
Two. One in the chest and
the other grazed her ear.
How many shots were
fired at the time of murder?
Only two.
Did you see both being fired?
No. l only heard the first.
When l turned around, l saw
the accused firing the second.
lsn't it possible that
she fired the first shot too?
When l confiscated her pistol,
l found only one shot had been fired.
Another person fired the
second shot from another gun.
- Right?
- Yes.
How long after the first
shot was the second fired?
Barely a second.
ln fact even less.
Was the hand of the accused
raised when the shot was fired?
Yes.
- Are you the ballistic expert?
- Yes.
The bullet found in the
body of the deceased, Maya..
...was not fired from the pistol
in the hands of the accused?
- Right?
- Yes.
What pistol was in the hands of
the accused at the time of murder?
From what gun was the bullet found
in the body of the deceased fired?
Do you easily find such
pistols in this country?
No. The license is generally
not given to the common man.
Two killers fired at Maya
from 2 different pistols.
Both the pistols were of the
same kind and were fired together.
And at the same victim.
Doesn't this prove that
it was a joint conspiracy?
You may leave.
Now l will prove who is the
real beneficiary of this murder.
The accused, Bani
or the other killer.
And l begin with such
a strange witness...
Who probably knew about the murder..
...even before the real
murderer thought about it.
l think this bald man
will nail Bani.
Refer to me as Muthu Swamy.
- Are you an astrologer?
- My entire family was.
Meaning you predict the
destiny of all generations.
What does that mean?
What is this new bill?
l wish to know if
you predict the future?
After being paid Rs. 501 .
After accepting Rs. 501 , you'd
written something about Maya's future
Something? lt's so important.
l'll personally read it out.
28 March. ln a month, Maya will
suffer a tragic train or road mishap.
But she will escape. lt's definite.
- What else is written?
- lt also says...
For a year from that date
she will be at grave risk...
..to life at the hands of a dear one.
lf she escapes, she will
die after bearing 5 kids.
Today if she were safe,
couldn't she have 5 kids?
lt says so here.
Did Prof. Swamy's first
prediction come true?
Yes. A month later we barely
escaped in a car accident.
According to the second prediction
Maya would lose her life to a near one
Did she have any other family
members apart from Bani?
No. We didn't doubt poor Bani.
But we were worried that she
shouldn't innocently do something.
So l sent my wife out of
the city for the period.
Then why did you get her
back before the year was up?
The period would have
ended at midnight.
And her train was
to arrive at midnight.
l didn't imagine anything
would happen in a few seconds.
You had a child when your
wife was away in Delhi.
Did Bani know about this?
We'd decided not to tell anyone
till the period got over.
At the time of murder, the accused
Bani didn't know Maya had a child.
She only knew that in the
absence of a child, after Maya...
She would inherit the property.
Does the defense want
to interrogate the witness?
Did you love your wife?
- Yes.
- How much?
A lot.
lf you loved her so much,
why didn't you hate her sister?
What do you want to say?
l want to say that
you are lying to the court.
You are a con man.
lf Bani killed your wife,
why do you pretend to love her?
My love is not artificial.
l am sorry for her innocence.
There are some people in this world..
...who present their right cheek
when slapped on the left cheek.
l'll give you such a slap
that both jaws will ache!
How many days before your
wife's death was the child born?
About a month.
lf Bani had known you had
a child would she have killed?
- Maybe not.
- Then why did you keep this from her?
l kept nothing from her.
Bani herself stopped meeting me.
l never had the opportunity
to tell her anything.
Bani herself came to you
a few hours before the murder.
Yes and Maya was to come
with the child in a few hours.
Would Bani have enjoyed hearing
the news or seeing the child?
What do you think?
- Have you ever had a pistol?
- No.
- Since when is Bani with you?
- From her childhood.
When she was with you, how many
hours a day would she be home?
- About 1 7-18 hours.
- The rest of the time?
- ln school.
- Did the school teach gun shooting?
According to you, when the
station was crowded with people..
She shot between them.
She shot at the woman who
was inside the stopping train.
- Right?
- Yes.
A woman who shoots
under these circumstances..
She's either a great
marksman or crazy.
Do you think Bani is mad?
No. Only a good marksman.
Where did she learn to shoot
if not at your house or school?
The question is not in order.
l don't think so. Only a good
marksman can commit this crime.
- None other.
- That will be proved.
The question is only about where
the accused learnt to shoot.
For many months she has worked
as secretary to the defense.
Whatever... l request the court
to give us time to gather evidence.
You are given 15 days.
The question is why was she
killed at a crowded station?
She wasn't allowed to reach home.
Possibly the murderer didn't want
Mrs. Rai to meet or talk to anyone.
Meaning Mrs. Rai knew some secret..
...that might risk the killer.
Absolutely!
That is why she was killed at
the station before getting home.
Then why wasn't she killed in Delhi?
Suppose this murder
took place in Delhi..
Our secretary wouldn't be caught.
And we would be spared.
So the murder happened
in Bombay to frame Bani.
But what is it that
caused her to be killed?
Mrs. Rai and the killer know it.
Mrs. Rai can't talk
because she is dead.
And the killer doesn't want to die.
l think something happened
in Delhi that caused the murder.
The child was born in Delhi.
- Child..
- Yes, Mrs. Rai's.
For the first time,
you said something clever.
l'm always brilliant but
you understood it only now.
Beyond your brains.
Payment..?
Good client.
How are you?
Please come in.
How far has the case progressed?
The case is getting
confusing by the day.
But Ajay said there's
no cause to worry.
Everything is fine but
we can't find the killer.
But what has the killer
got to do with my case?
Your case..?
That's on the 8th.
Where is your ayah?
So that is your killer.
Not the killer but a
step towards the killer.
l want to ask her some questions.
lt would be kind of you to call her.
Ask her not to tell anyone.
This man is a good friend of mine.
Whatever he says, don't tell anyone.
Who is the girl who came
with you to the milk center?
She's Marina, my childhood friend.
Childhood friend...?
Who else has played with her?
Don't you recall?
Try and remember...
Or my Rosie will be in trouble.
Where have l gone?
l've come for my Marina.
- To meet Marina?
- Yes. - But that's me.
You are Marina!
When did you grow up?
ls this your child?
No, it's my master's.
He just left in the car.
And the woman with him is his sister?
Sweetheart not sister.
But who are you to ask?
You don't recognise John D'Silva?
How you've grown!
- Yes.
- Where's the mole on your nose?
Yesterday l rubbed my nose
thrice and today l found you.
Rub your nose a little more.
- Ajay here.
- Found anything?
Not a thing. Everything
is as Rai testified.
l even went to the delivery home.
l'm now at the hotel she lived in.
But there's nothing suspicious here.
- Did you find anything?
- Just a letter.
Addressed to Mrs. Rai
redirected from Grand Hotel.
Read out the address.
Room 301 .
Was a woman called Mrs. Rai
staying here a few days ago?
Yes, she lived here for 7 months
and left on the 27th of March.
- Did she have a child?
- Child? No.
Can you tell me what kind
of people came to meet her?
l think she lived alone.
Were you on duty in 301 last month?
- Yes sir.
- Who came to meet Mrs. Rai?
Nobody. Oh 2 days before she left
the hotel, 2 men came to see her.
One left that very day and the
other man was in the room across.
They ate together and
finally left together.
What was his name?
- Can you describe him?
- Can't forget his face.
A swarthy face with bushy
eye brows and piercing eyes.
Thin lips, a moustache and
a wound on his left eye.
You are called to the office.
Bani, come here.
l feel l will suffocate
within these walls.
- You never came to see me.
- l'm running around day and night.
Don't lose heart.
Everything will be fine.
Today l've come to see you.
Soon l'll come to take you away.
- When?
- Very soon.
Was your sister pregnant
before she left for Delhi?
She never mentioned it.
Do you have a relative called Khanna?
- No.
- Your sister or her husband's friend?
- l don't think.
- Try to recall.
He has a deep wound
mark on his left eye.
Wound scar? l never
saw any such man.
- At the station?
- Not even there.
How is that related to the case?
See you.
Come in. How did you come by today?
What else is news?
Can a man's picture be
made without seeing him?
l mean just by asking his features.
Sure. l've made one.
- You..?
- Yes. Would you like to see it?
- Yes. Where is it?
- Come with me.
The girl is my friend's beloved.
l made this by asking her features.
- What does your friend say?
- He feels it resembles the girl.
- Why are you asking?
- l want to get one made.
- Whose?
- Mr. Khanna.
- Who is he?
- He stayed in Grand hotel.
There's a bearer called
Ahmed over there.
He remembers Khanna well.
Here is the address.
Go to Delhi today itself.
- Who is that lady?
- Meenadevi.
She's our famous dancer.
Famous dancer and l have no clue.
Come over in the evening.
There's a grand program.
- ls that so?
- Yes, she's dancing after 7 months.
- She made others dance then?
- No, she was on leave.
Ajay isn't here.
You're back? You're funny.
Why did you put down the phone?
My head is still stewing!
l myself am upset.
There were 2 Mrs. Rais in Delhi.
Two? There's another one
wanting to become Mrs. Rai.
- Stop fooling.
- l'm not fooling.
l've seen her myself.
She goes to his house everyday.
Who is she?
- Who is she?
- Mr. Rai's hotel dancer.
- Since when is she here?
- 6-7 days.
- Where was she before this?
- On leave for 6-7 months.
- But why do you want to
kidnap the child? - Simple.
There were 2 Mrs. Rais in Delhi.
Only one can be the real mother.
lf she's alive, we'll know
the moment the child vanishes.
Because a mother is a mother.
But where will you keep the infant?
- That's my responsibility.
- Fine but be careful.
Don't you worry.
- Why have you come so late?
- To arrest you.
Show me your hand.
- Am l a thief?
- A great one.
- What have l stolen?
- My heart.
Why would l steal it?
You must have lost it.
Give your statement in court
but l will arrest you.
- How?
- Tell you...Like...this.
- What is this?
- A handcuff that arrests 2 hearts.
You're so naughty.
l thought the baby was crying.
- l must leave.
- So early?
l have to arrange for the wedding.
- ln the night?
- Never delay a good deed.
- When will we meet?
- Tomorrow at the same time.
Have you seen the baby?
- lsn't' he in the room?
- No. He's nowhere.
l'm calling from the house.
Please call the master.
- Call from the house.
- House..?
Sir, l'm Marina.
Yes?
Why are you stuttering?
What's the matter?
- The baby is lost.
- What??
- The baby is lost.
- Where the hell were you?
Liked the dance?
Why are you silent?
- Come with me.
- Where?
l'll tell you on the way.
Please come in, sir.
That day you ran away.
Today l won't let you escape.
l didn't come here to go.
Really? Sit down.
- Hope you're not hurt.
- No.
- Has your father agreed?
- To what?
Our marriage.
That day you ran away
without giving me an answer.
Today l won't let you go.
Do l lack anything?
No. Not at all.
Sharp eyes, curly hair.
Juicy lips, fair skin.
A flexible body.
The delicacy of roses.
The intoxication of wine.
One who drinks will never
ever gain consciousness.
and the best part is
you dance so well...
That the god of dance
would be embarrassed.
As pretty as your name.
l'd love to marry you.
But l can't because l'm married.
- You're married?
- Yes.
- Why are you crying?
- She's no more.
- Who?
- Wife.
- Then...
- No, darling.
l can't ruin the life
of an innocent girl.
You are unmarried
and l have a child.
Doesn't matter.
You are great.
My dear son, you are fortunate.
You found yourself a mother
and a wife for your father.
Keep him carefully.
l have just one child.
Okay, see you.
You may go. The child is
with me. So you will return.
- Sure.
- Say bye to Papa.
- How did the child vanish?
- Don't know.
What do you mean?
Where were you?
l'd just come down.
You wretch! Why did you
leave the child and go?
l came to get milk for the baby.
- Did anyone come home?
- No sir.
Has a ghost taken him? How did he
vanish with both of you around?
- l don't know.
- Shut up!
Honestly tell me
who had come here.
- l'll give you what you want.
- l didn't see anyone come in.
Now hear this. lf anyone finds out
the baby is missing, l'll kill you.
- Whom are you calling?
- The police.
Be wise.
You maybe the child's mom but
for the world l'm the father.
And the mother was Maya.
Doesn't matter.
Let me call the police!
Don't be silly. We'll both be
hanged if the cops find the truth.
You want your way.
But if my baby is harmed..!
l care more for him than you.
l did all this only for him.
Then what's wrong now?
Why don't you inform the police?
Try to understand me.
l don't want to hear anything
l'm shocked why you don't understand?
lf we are complain to the cops,
the kidnappers will realise...
And his life could be at risk.
Then..will my baby never be found?
- My baby!!
- Be brave.
Be careful. Somebody
surely doubts us.
Don't let anyone know
your child is lost.
Or that you are upset.
- Seen these?
- Yes sir.
Then tell me how was Khanna's
nose, eyes, chin and lips.
The eyes were like this.
And this was the chin.
These were the lips.
The nose was either this or that.
- What do you think?
- lt's Mr. Khanna all right.
But you didn't make his moustache.
- How was it?
- Hero cut.
Like this?
A deep wound scar here.
Recognise it? lt's
your child's voice.
My baby!
Do you mean Mr. Rai's child?
You know that better.
l want to talk to his father.
lf it's not you, put the phone down.
Who are you?
l am the child's mother.
When you've owned this, tell us
the rest and take the baby back.
But who are you?
Where do l come?
Listen, if you act smart...
Your child will suffer.
Give the line to Miss Meena.
- When?
- No idea. She'd received a call.
What are you doing here?
l was going to the hotel.
Jump in. l'm going there.
This chap put one up on us.
Would you like me to try my way?
Here's your Khanna. l made him
exactly as the hotel boy described.
Now it's up to you.
l've surely seen this man somewhere.
- Where?
- Wait. Let me think.
Where have l seen him?
At the hotel?
ln the train? Or bus?
ln the court?
ln Rai's hotel?
No....
Movie hall?
Yes, in the picture.
This is the man who died along with
motorbike on the night of the murder.
The police is still
searching for his antecedents.
There is only one person
wit you in joys and sorrows.
And that is me.
l dread to think of our future
if this is how you'll behave.
Why don't you tell me?
What is the matter?
- What is wrong with you?
- l don't understand anything!
What do l do? Where do l go?
l hate you, myself, everything!
- Go away from here!
- Are you mad?
No.
Today l am not mad.
l was mad, the day l got taken
in by your promise to marry me.
And became a dancer in this hotel!
l was mad the day l handed
my precious child over to you!
Why are you talking like this?
Somebody has misled you.
Somebody told you something.
- Tell me who it was.
- Nobody misled me!
Forgive me. l am as
worried as you are.
Don't you know they
telephoned me too?
They will return the child
if we tell them the truth.
- Why don't you tell them?
- How can l?
We will be hanged and
Bani will inherit everything.
Our child will die of starvation!
- ls this what you want?
- Why don't you tell the cops?
lnform them.
Don't take their name.
Don't' you know they will kill
baby before the cops get there?
Then you won't find
the baby or its' body!
lf you still insist, we'll call them.
Your madness will kill the baby.
Take this. Here!
Remember if the baby is harmed...
You'll be responsible.
Trust me. l'm doing my best.
Your child will be found.
Give me some time.
l say think it over again,
This concerns the gutter.
There's no time to think.
Say what you want to.
Take this. Keep an eye.
Hello constable.
- Got a match?
- Yes. Here.
That's a good lighter.
Where did you steal it?
Not stolen, found.
Belongs to the gutter.
- Not finished work?
- The supervisor hasn't come.
l'm waiting for him.
lf l hadn't closed it,
we'd both be locked up.
lt was a cop. Got rid
of him with difficulty.
- l'm making a move.
- Wait for sometime.
- l'm coming.
- Okay.
- ls your master in?
- No.
- Do you know when he'll return?
- No idea.
- How is the baby?
- Baby?
- The one your master brought..
- He didn't get any baby.
What's your name?
Listen...
lf there is a baby here,
these 1000 bucks can be yours.
- There's no child here.
- You're lying!
Help! Help!
Get up!
Go in and check.
Very good! Am l the only
fool to bell the cat?
- You go in. - How?
- By the door.
- Somebody might see me.
- Am l invisible?
- lsn't Marina your friend?
- That's true.
Go in through her.
lt's safe till the compound.
l won't go in the building.
- Then l'll go.
- Go ahead.
But what do l answer Bani
if something happens to you?
Let me go.
- l'll go.
- So you will go?
Who else? lf l don't return
assume l was of use to you.
- l'm going to take Rai's statement
- What statement?
- Confession to the crime.
- How?
l have a trick. Be ready.
We'll nab Mrs. Rai's killer tonight.
Tempers are rising.
Are you mad at your sweetheart?
l'm nobody's darling!
You are crying. What's wrong?
As if you care.
What would you know about
what happened in these days!
What happened?
My master's baby is lost.
No big deal. l'll call
the police station right now.
No, sir has prohibited
us from telling anyone.
- ls that so?
- l'll lose my job.
John's sweetheart worried
about an ayah's job. Silly.
Tell me who is in the house now?
- Nobody.
- Nobody? Come along.
- When will the master come?
- He's always late.
Then let's go.
- Till when are you on duty?
- Till night.
lf Meena gets a call or
goes out, inform me.
l'll be inside.
lf the piano is removed,
it will look like my servant's room.
- Servant's room? - Yes, my
house in Goa is 1000 times better.
- Where is the switch board?
- What for?
For the switch board machine.
- What's that for?
- You.
For your voice. To record it.
The recording is for the
company which is for the job.
The job is for you.
And you...
- Really?
- Yes. Where is it?
Gently...
My master is back! Hide!
Meena, it's you?
You may go.
Just a minute, darling.
No darling. Not yet.
But l'm trying my best
to find the child.
- Why do you worry?
- l know everything.
l want my child or
l'll call the police!
Are you out of your mind?
Our hands are tainted with blood.
We will be hanged.
You worry about yourself.
Let the police handle my child.
Why are you saying this?
Why don't you understand?
Look, you have delivered the
baby as Mrs. Rai in Delhi.
You travelled with my wife
from there to Bombay.
You left your child
in the compartment.
l did this because you asked me to.
All right. But nobody other than
you and me were witness to this.
l sent Khanna along with my wife.
Now if you go to the police,
you too will be in trouble.
For my child's sake,
l'm ready to be hanged!
- l'll go to the police.
- That won't be right.
But if you insist,
l'll complain to the police.
Rest assured.
l'll rest only after
you have got your child.
He's put the phone down.
You may leave.
John's life is in this.
Some other time.
What a man! l'd have
suffered a heart failure!
- Job done?
- Our job is done.
But somebody else will be ruined.
- What happened?
- He kept the phone down
And got a pistol. l thought
Motilal's is on the hit list.
But thank goodness he didn't see me.
- Then..?
- He drove off in the car.
l'm still sweating. Let's go.
Ajay here. Rai is going to kill you!
Save yourself somehow.
l'm informing the police.
- ls this a joke?
- Hurry, inspector.
Rai has gone to the
hotel to kill Meena.
- Who is he?
- Step here.
He's the man who got Khanna to
kill his wife at Bombay Central.
And then killed him.
But who are you?
Throw away the pistol
or you'll be shot.
lf you step forward, l'll kill her!
You've followed death, not me.
Our hands are tainted with blood.
We will be hanged.
Why don't you understand?
You delivered a child in a
Delhi maternity home as Mrs. Rai.
You travelled with my wife
from Delhi to Bombay.
You left your child
in the compartment.
l did that because you asked me to.
No one was witness to that
other than you and me.
l sent Khanna to where my wife is.
lf you still wish,
you may go to the police.
But remember we won't be safe.
All this proves that the
accused, Bani is innocent.
Bani is hereby released with honour.
Excuse me.
This proves that the
accused Bani is a killer.
And so skillful that she ruined
Ajay in just one glance.
Therefore by the lndian
Penal Code, section 302..
Bani is sentenced to life
imprisonment in Ajay's cell.
The court is adjourned
for the honeymoon season.
