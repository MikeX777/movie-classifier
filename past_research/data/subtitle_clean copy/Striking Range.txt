The employees are not gonna get nervous
and call the Federals, are they?
What do you expect
when you make them bait?
Don't worry,
I've shut down all the outbound calls.
He may have a future as a cyber-athlete.
You know, some people make a living
playing those computer games.
Sitting at a computer console playing
first-person shooter games 24 hours a day
does not make you an athlete,
it makes you a college applicant reject.
Go on, move! Move! Move! Move!
God, I always wondered what it'd be like
sitting in a Trojan horse
all day and all night.
They just couldn't stay away
from the fabled pot of gold.
Move! Move!
God. it looks like they got Sharon.
I told her to leave. If she wants
to be bait, I say let her be bait.
You got our full payment up front, right?
- What's she doing here anyway?
- She likes Vash.
She's whacked.
You know, the other day, her eyes
were rolling in the back of her head.
She was complaining of a headache.
You know, so I asked her,
you know, if I could get her something,
you know, like a glass of water.
She sends me to the damn pharmacy.
Cost me over a hundred bucks.
Hasn't paid me back yet.
That is nothing. I went to the pharmacy
to get Denise's nebulizer. $160.
- I Tave in position?
- Yeah.
You know, I’m telling you
your son is one of the best
computer game players I’ve ever seen.
Last summer, he spent 10 hours a day,
every day, playing that damn game.
If you had kids,
you'd change your tune, trust me.
All right, I can see them all now.
Mabe baby, let's open this Trojan horse.
All right, Tave, we're moving.
Rule number one, people?
- We do not take a bullet...
- For a client.
Amen.
Combination!
You know what I’d like to see?
They've got steering wheels
for the driving games, right?
Like, joysticks that vibrate
and all kinds of stuff
for the flight sim games.
What they need is a gun or a rifle
for these first-person shooter games.
I’m sure they have them.
Yeah, you'd have to aim, reload.
Have sensors so you can duck and stuff.
And then maybe a foot pedal
to control your movements
and where you face, instead of a mouse.
Any women play
these first-person shooter games?
Not you too, huh?
I’d say less than 5%.
So it's just a bunch of pale-skinned guys,
sitting around, whose only meaningful
relationships are with their DSL?
Right? is that what it is?
- Yeah, those losers.
- All right. This hallway is clear.
Thank God.
- There's nothing here.
- She's right. There's nothing here!
All right, all right.
We'll start beating her hand.
I don't have the combination!
You don't have to have it! No.
You don't know what you're up against.
it doesn't matter.
They're gonna kill us anyway, Sharon.
Sharon. Sharon Careington,
here in the flesh.
Your daddy is gonna get real pissed off.
One guard, four hostages.
So much for surprise.
You know, Mabe, his son, Robert, is good.
He's real good.
See, that's exactly why I can't wait
for you to get married and have kids.
People running around cyberspace,
killing each other with guns, is not real.
At least if he makes a mistake online,
he lives another day.
Hey, hey, come on now, I shushed her.
- She didn't shut up.
- What? I should shoot her?
Move it! Sit down! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Sit down! Don't look up!
Oh, my God, they're gonna kill us all.
Look at this.
Look at this. They're lining us up.
They're gonna kill us all one at a time.
Somebody say something,
do something to these people.
Oh, my God, my wife.
I have a wife and a little girl at home.
I just ordered a sports car.
Haven't even driven it yet.
I love my car.
You guys are getting sloppy.
All right, Tave,
you and Mabe take care of these people.
We'll clean up the last little bit.
Please don't kill me yet.
I just bought a new HDTV.
My wife hasn't finished her boob job.
Please don't shoot me.
The other day, Robert was
the last member of his team, right?
- Yeah.
- His instincts were great, man.
He was up against four pretty good players,
he took each one of them out,
the last one with a wall shot.
He won the game.
Precisely my point. It's a game.
It's not just a game, man.
You can make a living in the CPL.
- All right, freeze! Freeze!
- Move that! Move it! Move in there!
Move back! Move back! Move back!
- Don't listen to him! Shoot!
- What did I say?
- What did I tell you?
- You bastard. My father will have you killed.
You shut up, bitch!
Drop your gun right now!
- Drop it right now!
- Robert spent so much time...
- Drop the gun right now!
- ... on that game.
I’m just starting to get
a little bit jealous.
Just think of all the hand-eye coordination
he's getting
- from the hours spent on the mouse.
- Right.
Drop your gun right now!
I’m telling you guys!
Drop your gun right now!
- You're a dead man! Don't listen to him.
- You shut up!
You got those SS109's?
All I have are these soft 7.62's.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Put your gun down right now!
- Or I’ll shoot her right now!
- We haven't been paid yet.
Shoot the bastard! Now! I order you!
She is ordering us.
- Drop your gun right now!
- Shoot!
Mabe, come on in, bring your med kit.
You tell him what...
Don't, don't let him tell you what to do.
Oh, the MVP Award?
How can you call him a little girl
when you're the one who screamed?
- You know what? I didn't just...
- You're the one who screamed.
You won't let it go. And you.
You know how much coffee I had
to drink to talk that fast?
I will tell you one other thing.
The next time I send you inside
you are going in as a deaf mute.
- Robert De Niro you ain't.
- Okay, deaf mute.
Welcome to Billings Laboratories.
How may I direct your call?
I'm sorry. Mr. Billings
isn't taking any calls.
Would you like to speak
with his assistant, Monica?
Emily, I want you in on the test.
But no one else. And it'll be Lab C.
- Why not the main lab?
- Magnetic shielding issues.
I don't give a damn about shielding.
I just don't want
the mongrels watching this.
That's how rumors get started.
Power levels are ready.
Distance to target would be
thirty-six inches.
- Everything's set.
- What did you tell them?
That you wanted to
run some tests yourselves.
And no, they don't think it's ready yet.
- But you did finish the...
- Yes, Dad. It's ready.
Yeah. Well, we'll see.
Initiating pre-sequence.
- Power to 80.
- 80.
Initiating primary trigger.
Now.
The hole's diameter is two inches.
Depth is 4.5 inches.
4.5 inches?
It's three inches more than...
- We did it!
- We?
- it doesn't seem very warm.
- It's not supposed to be.
it doesn't split. it separates the quarks,
destabilizing the atom.
But a destabilized atom...
The quarks come together,
held by gluon to create stable atoms
and thus stable molecules.
You see, what my father found was that
by neutralizing the gluon he could
create a concentrated particle beam.
Where the hole is now, it didn't explode?
it separated, Emily.
it separated at the most basic level.
The atoms ceased to bond.
So it worked?
- Three inches deeper than I expected.
- And we should be able to increase that.
- Well, the client will be thrilled.
- No, they won't be.
And, as head of my security team,
I’ll need you at the meeting.
Brice, I’m sure that he knows
that he couldn't have done this without you.
There are some shielding problems
with the power supply.
You wanted this portable. We're gonna need
to redesign some elements.
We're 40% over budget in development
and now you want us to go back,
back to the drawing board?
You'd be more unhappy if you took
possession of something that doesn't work.
Yes, but we expect results.
We'll eat some of the overages ourselves.
We'll talk again in a month.
Dr. Billings, I think you need to understand
that these people that I represent
are very serious people.
Look, I went to work for you guys
to give you my absolute best.
That's what I’m gonna do.
Yes, you are. I’ll be in touch.
Brice. Take the prototype and hide it.
Clean the computer as well.
You try and help some people...
Emily didn't inform me
you were coming down, sir.
Let's see.
Is Emily my boss? Or am I Emily's boss?
Of course, sir.
You're out of water again.
I brought you your candy bar.
It's one of one of your favorites. I’ll...
I’ll just leave it here for you.
Now I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to watch this crate for me.
It's very important.
Can I count on you, Shawn?
- Trouble?
- It's gone. The crazy bastard.
Hey. It's gone.
And the computer's been wiped clean.
I don't know. If you don't put together
something tonight, we're screwed.
- What did you find?
- Nothing. Just Brice's entry.
And I talked to the guard.
He complained about Brice.
I wouldn't worry about that. Take a look.
- I don't see anything.
- You see that?
There's a record of something there.
- I do see it. Somebody changed something.
- Somebody on the inside.
Well, I will find him.
I’ll get my team right on it.
In the meantime,
you'll bring in some outside help.
- Sir, my security department...
- Is compromised.
Put them somewhere else.
You had a break-in at the Fort Worth plant.
You get your people on that today.
- Sir...
- I don't want them here.
I’ve been watching you, Emily.
There is only four people
who know that this thing works.
Well, I haven't said anything.
I know. Keep it that way.
Now, I’m gonna need
some serious protection,
more than your staff can handle.
Get me that guy we gave the Malaysian
operation to several years ago.
He was good.
What was his name?
Bash, Basher, something.
- Vasher. With a "V."
- Yeah, yeah, that's him.
What do we tell him?
That a stalker took a dump in my bed,
left life-threatening notes.
Hell, you can tell him I’m being chased
by werewolves, I don't care.
Okay.
- I’ll tell him to pack the wooden stakes.
- Silver bullets.
- Sir?
- Yeah, it's silver bullets with werewolves.
Right.
Am I the only one that knows this shit?
Yeah. He asked for you.
No, not by me.
I wouldn't say that.
- Well, let me think about it.
- Well, don't take too long.
You start tonight.
- Can you wire the first half today?
- I'm sure accounting can do that.
Fine, I'll tell them.
We move fast,
we drop everybody who gets in the way.
Except Billings, of course.
- What about...
- That's not gonna be a problem.
Questions?
He's bringing in
some private contractors as well.
Yeah, that's why we've got to move quick.
The good news is
they're having trouble paying some bills.
Looks like I’m gonna need
my Fed suit again.
The Careington job is done. Over.
It's time to move on.
I’ll file it under Mosul,
Houston and Santa Clarita.
Hey, Santa Clarita was not my fault.
Honey, could you go see if your mom
needs your help in the kitchen?
Hey, shortcake.
Vash, it's bad. Real bad.
I was hoping Careington
would pay the balance.
- They still might.
- You don't have a family.
You know, you're the best tactical guy
I’ve ever seen.
I mean, in that realm, you are the man,
but nobody, nobody's great at everything.
Nobody does everything A plus.
- Let me handle the business.
- No, that's my job.
- So, let me help.
- No.
Emily called.
- Emily Johansson? I thought...
- Yeah.
Yeah, she called anyway.
She has a job for us.
- Wants us to do bodyguard work.
- That's not our style.
That's what I told her, "No thanks. "
She works over at Billings.
Billings Lab, right?
- Yep.
- That billionaire guy?
- Yep.
- Does it pay a lot?
What's the point?
We don't do bodyguard work.
it pays a lot.
Hey, Robert! Robert!
Wait, wait. Hold, hold, hold.
You guys aren't going out now are you?
We talked about this already.
- You said it was okay.
- No we didn't.
You, me and Denise were supposed
to all go out together.
Look, I’ll be back home later tonight.
You said it was okay already.
Thanks. Let's go, guys.
Body guarding isn't one of your three rules.
- Don't take a bullet...
- For a client.
- Always...
- Plan.
And don't go against the U.S. government.
You're right.
Body guarding isn't one of the three.
Well.
The time for planning isn't great,
but the other two seem to fit.
I’ve already sent Tave ahead.
Building maintenance.
So we start tonight. They pay up front?
Vash, dinero, dollars and cents.
Come on, brother, I need it.
Two weeks. That's not gonna cut it.
Are you in or not?
Dig it.
All right, I’ve got to collect a few things.
I’ll swing back by here in one hour.
Have Mabe meet us here then.
- Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.
- Bye, Mr. Hatem!
- Bye, Amanda.
What's up with Mom?
Go enjoy your friends, sweetie.
Agent Kilmer, FBI.
I've got an offer you're gonna want to hear.
Eugene. Here's yours, John.
- And you must be Mabe.
- Yeah. Hi.
Hi. Well, let me get you guys situated.
Billings works until 9:00 most evenings
and then heads home.
Most of the employees leave at 5:00 to 5:30.
Monday's a holiday.
Should be a real quiet night.
We have a central room
for security operations.
Some parts of the facility
are under pretty tight lock and key.
Now, I will always cover Billings
when he's moving.
When he's not, I lead the first shift
and you guys cover the other two.
- You were once Secret Service, right?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Does he stay in his office while he's here?
Yes, usually.
And when he's not, I will let you know.
One will be in advance
and the other behind.
Now, this is the security operations.
I always have somebody here.
They've been instructed
on what they can provide you with.
I’ll need the building schematics as well
as a floor plan of the Billings' house
and the routes getting to and from.
Absolutely. Judd can help you.
Eugene?
So, what kind of threat are we looking at?
Nothing much.
Billings is just spooked out
by some threatening letters.
You don't feel the need
for extra protection?
Well, that answers the question
about the last time.
Okay. I guess I deserve that.
I’m not good at that confrontation stuff.
Bullshit, Vash!
You confront just fine when it suits you.
I deserve to know why.
I don't suppose it would help to say
that I made a huge mistake,
that I was selfish?
No, no. it doesn't help.
Not a bit.
Can we start over?
What, wipe the slate clean? A fresh start?
Make believe it didn't happen?
Any of those happy clichés? Hell, no.
You can pretend that the injury
isn't there, but I still have the scars.
All right. That's fair.
I don't know how, but apparently
we're gonna have to work together now.
You do look great, Em.
Mr. Vasher? Ted Billings.
- Don't know if you remember me.
- Of course I do, sir.
This is my son, Brice.
He's got an I.Q. higher than me
and still stupid. Got that from his mother.
Well, let's sit down.
I know this is probably just a milk run
for somebody like yourself.
The truth is
I think someone's coming after me.
What do you base that on, sir, the threats?
No. Somebody's got it out for me.
I’m sure it's just some kind of harmless
nut, but they can be the worst kind.
Probably one of the union leeches
that lost his job.
"Each according to his abilities,
each according to his needs. "
You know who said that?
- Abraham Lincoln?
- No. Lenin.
I thought he wrote,
"Imagine all the people... "
Not that one, dumb shit.
The first leader of the Soviet communists.
Yes, sir. Do you have any specific
union leech in mind? You have a name?
What does it matter?
They're all part of the same damn mafia.
Just keep me safe for the next few weeks.
Can you do that?
That's affirmative, sir.
Mr. Billings, about this wire...
Mr. Vasher, I don't do the accounting.
That's why
I have an accounting department.
If you have a question for them,
pick up the phone and call them.
Anything else?
- No, sir.
- Real good.
I’ll be here till 10:00.
Then I’m going home.
- Why are you playing with him?
- Why do you say that?
You have a political science degree, Vash.
Abraham Lincoln.
If somebody's really
after him, he's done for.
Yeah? And I thought you were the best.
I am, as long as I have all the information.
I’ll call down to accounting for you.
By the way, it's Karl Marx,
not Vladimir Lenin.
- Where'd you put it?
- Haskell.
What the hell's Haskell?
The old warehouse?
There's no security there.
Dad, sometimes the best hiding place
is just right out in the open.
Hell, no!
What were you thinking? You go get it.
No, never mind.
I’ll get it tonight
after the conference call with Malaysia.
Take it to the house.
You pick me up in the garage at 9:00 p. m.
Hey! You taking your medication?
I will put you back.
Ought to be the poster child
for birth control.
Brice.
Milk run, huh?
So, has... Hi.
Has anyone talked to you about the...
- About what?
- It's really more of an office legend.
Legend?
Oh, a couple of mysterious deaths,
unexplained.
But... Gotta run.
You know, for such a high level of access,
there sure are a lot of closed doors.
Well, that's the thing about this place.
Left hand doesn't know
what the right arm is doing.
Hand.
Right hand, left hand.
Never mind.
Mabe, after you get this set up,
you can head on home.
You've got first shift tomorrow.
Meet at Billings at 6:00 a. m.
and relieve Hatem and myself.
I don't know
what the hell I’m doing with Tave yet.
Copy that. All right, here's your PDA.
It's got all the files on it
from the Billings house.
At least the latest that's on file
with the Planning and Zoning Commission.
All right, great. I’ll leave this here.
I’ll call Tave and have him come pick it up.
All right.
Listen, Judd. it is Judd, right?
What's this about an "office legend"?
Billings' son Brice
mentioned something about it.
He thinks something's wandering around
killing people.
Good.
Shawn, did you
take the motorcycle out again?
- How are you?
- Fine.
it clears out pretty early around here,
doesn't it?
Yes ma'am.
After 5:30, there's not many people left.
I’ll be back bright and early,
that's for sure.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thanks.
Yeah, sorry, no I.D., no appointment.
I’m just here to kidnap and torture Billings
to get some information.
I took care of the stairwell cameras.
- The doors are locked from the inside.
- Got it.
Remember, when I give you the signal,
kill the power.
He's in the power room. Let's go.
Some of these floors
have very little security.
We don't need it on every floor.
I’ll be walking the halls.
Enjoy your trip.
He's on a conference call right now
that should be finishing up at any time.
He also said something about
running an errand on the way home.
- Where?
- He hasn't mentioned it to me yet.
You know, in the meantime,
I can cover Billings.
So if you guys want to take a break,
feel free.
- A break?
- Yeah.
There's an employee lounge one floor down
and on the other side of the building.
- It's really nice.
- A break.
Yeah, yeah. A break, Vash.
She said we could take a break.
- I’m not hungry.
- Vash, go take a break.
You really dig this corporate stuff, huh?
They say if you can win the rat race,
you get to call your own shots.
I’ve heard that winning the rat race
makes you number one rat.
- Break time.
- Yeah, I think I’m gonna take a break.
Break time. Break time.
That was harsh, Vash.
She was just trying to be nice.
You know...
Okay, kill the lights.
Killing the computers,
exterior and elevators.
Killing the main now.
Bob?
- Great.
- What the hell was that?
Tave, check power.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Shots fired.
What the hell was that?
What's going on out there? I lost the call!
Get that call back right now
and turn on the lights!
Turn on the damn lights!
Is anyone out there?
Get the phone and the lights back on.
Sounds like he's okay.
Vash, we've got to get him out of here.
Emily, you'd better make damn sure
it's safe up here.
Let me check this out.
John.
Okay, regroup in the garage.
Looks like the power's been turned off.
Computers and elevators
are still on-line though. Stand by.
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
Yeah, but why didn't they snatch Billings?
Maybe they didn't want to tangle with us?
How do you like me now, bitch?
Power's gonna be out for a while.
Tave, call Mabe and get her moving.
Truck, full kit. I don't like this stairwell.
Well, the elevators might still be on.
What about the stairwell
on the other side of the building?
Sir!
I'm not coming out until I know it's safe.
I’m telling you, Emily,
this is no pissed-off union worker.
We've got one body in the stairwell,
clean as a whistle.
Sir, we need to get you out of here.
All right, let's move.
I’m in the parking garage. Move in.
Elevators are still on.
That's nice, but I still want to use
the other stairwell.
I don't wanna get stuck in a box.
Sir, come on.
That other stairwell
will be around this way to the left.
You remember that time
you wore that little black dress
- when we went to that restaurant on top of...
- Vash, please.
it was the last time
we were on a dark floor together.
We really had something, Em.
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
You know, you get to the point in your life
when you can look back
and see the biggest mistake you ever made.
Hey, make war, not love.
You almost got shot, son.
- Get him out of here!
- Mr. Billings.
Our garage is closed right now.
I got three, maybe four targets
with automatics.
Damn it.
- Copy that.
- Look, we've got to get him out of here.
- Negative. Parking garage is O.B.
- What does that mean?
The parking garage is hot, sir.
We cannot go down there right now.
No, no, no. This is crazy.
We'll take the other stairwell.
Look, we don't know what we're up against.
We might walk into something
we're not equipped to handle.
Well, too late for that. Stairwell C.
Tave. Sitrep, stairwell C.
Negative. Leads to the same parking garage.
Sir. Sir!
You know,
maybe we should all just stick together?
Sure, why not?
Miss, stay in there
and keep the door shut, please.
Oh, good. You're gonna make me do this.
You okay?
Sun Tzu says to pitch the battle
on the field of your choice.
All right, get the men,
regroup down the road.
Mr. Billings?
Sir?
Emily?
Well, whoever that was is gone now.
Situation?
Tave did a firefight,
then a lower stairwell.
Billings bolted at the fourth floor offices,
Emily pursued and I’m trying to locate them.
Parking garage is clear.
Easy. What's going on? Who are you?
That's exactly what I want to know.
Brice Billings. My father told me
to pull the limo around at 9:00.
I’m already late, so...
Call them all in. Billings will probably go
to where he's keeping it.
We'll take care of business there.
Yeah, we'll hear from the inside.
Look, if you catch up to him,
you hold him till I get there, you got it?
Right.
- Hey, how's it going? You good?
- Yeah, yeah, I’m good. How about you?
- I’ve been better.
- Yeah, you got it.
- Rally point. Hold this position.
- Yeah, you got it.
- Lose something?
- He ran away.
That's what we should be doing.
Not me, Vash. This is my job.
I’ve got to find him.
Em, what's so important
that people are willing to die here tonight?
- Oh, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.
Here, go take off your
jacket and your shirt.
What's going on?
Next-generation weapons.
For the Department of Defense?
Let's just say Billings fulfills a niche market.
He got in early and he knows what he wants.
What market?
When Black Ops needs technology,
they can't just pop down to
Electronics-R-Us for what they need.
Wait a second.
These are government Black Ops people?
No, no.
There might be other groups that want to
get their hands on some of this technology.
Other groups?
Your shirt.
So, you have a boyfriend now?
Sorry.
I never figured
you'd stick out this corporate thing.
Yeah? Why's that?
- You were the most idealistic person I knew.
- Young and stupid, you mean?
I learned from you,
if you don't have your own agenda,
you get sucked into somebody else's.
Some people's agendas can be good.
Yeah? Well, now who's the idealist?
That's a very funny thought coming from
Mr. "I’ll Do Whatever I Want. "
Well, maybe I’ve changed.
Or, at the very least,
in the process of changing.
When you left me
you left something behind.
That didn't survive.
I’m sorry.
Yeah, hey, John,
we are down one "Over the Hill"
40th birthday party balloon.
Copy that. Down one balloon.
We need to find Billings.
That shouldn't be too hard.
Where would I hide
if I were a narcissistic son of a bitch?
Vash.
I would look
for the darkest corner of the room
and try to find the darkest place there.
Mr. Billings, the place is secure.
We can leave now.
How can you be so sure?
Hey. Mabe's moving.
Coordinate with our route to his house.
Which route we taking?
Just follow us.
You'll be told when you need to know.
"Need to know" was about an hour ago.
Em?
Leave the cell phone at home
next time, man.
You need to level with me.
What's really going on?
Nothing. Billings is getting a bit antsy.
I don't want him to just go off again.
Look, I don't think
we're dealing with just one thing here.
And one is professional.
Is there any chance that
this group is part of the U.S. government?
No.
Fair warning, if it is, we're out of here.
Fine. Look, we'll take him to his house.
It's a fort.
What's going on?
Well, it seems a pretty well-armed group
is a little pissed at your dad.
Oh, and there's that ninja wanna-be
that attacked us upstairs.
Someone attacked you?
Cut the crap. What do you know?
It's my brother.
- Your brother?
- Yes, my brother.
He has a disease. Porphyria.
Makes him insane,
madness of King George, all that stuff.
My father
keeps him locked up.
Your brother. Well, you better lock him up
tighter before he gets himself killed.
Or kills someone.
What's up?
So, she's telling you that this has
nothing to do with Uncle Sam, right?
That's what she's saying.
I figure we should walk away on this one.
Come on, man, don't play.
You got any proof?
No.
- It's just a feeling.
- I hear you.
- Who was that?
- Kilmer and his thugs.
No, I mean that maniac
that attacked us up there.
How the hell would I know?
Yeah, Mabe, when we get to Billings' house,
I need you to run me a blood sample.
Also, I need a report
on a disease called porphyria.
All right, thanks.
What's up with you, man?
I’ve never seen you this nervous.
We should walk, Vash.
Those same headlights have been with us
for a few miles. They're gaining.
Yeah, they probably were waiting for us
right outside of Billings.
- Yeah.
- We've got company.
Can you handle it?
Yeah, but it'd be nice to know
where we're going.
Not over the phone.
Just tell him to keep following.
Can you just keep following?
Probably not.
You're not heading to his house are you?
- Just do your best.
- No, bullshit!
Billings starts leveling with me,
or all bets are off. We're gonna walk.
We don't...
You listen up.
This is a terrorist group that wants
a very serious piece of technology I have.
I will not risk national security
over an unsecured line.
Just follow us and keep the bastards off me.
John, don't scratch my car.
- Want me to take care of them?
- Yeah. What are you waiting for?
No, no, no! Don't! Don't!
They might be government!
Fine. Stand down.
Left! Left!
Go, man.
Are you throwing this fight, John?
Are you throwing this fight?
Up here. Up here.
- I think they went this way.
- No, they did not, Vash.
Hey, who's driving here, me or you?
You better hope they went this way.
Tave! Tave, give me the phone!
Give me the phone back!
She's not answering.
John, you'd better tell me
why you sandbagged us.
What're you doing? Lose them!
You took money, John. You sold us out.
Vash, he came to my house.
What was I supposed to do?
- Why?
- it wasn't gonna hurt us.
No! No! Not good enough!
You're gonna tell me why!
Maggie said she's leaving me.
She's taking my kids away from me, Vash.
- What?
- My wife!
She's walking out on me
and she's taking my children away from me!
I had to do something, Vash!
Nobody else is.
How? How could you do this?
How could you do this, John?
Look, it's not just the Careington job.
The Rodgers case. The Monterey job.
- You son of a...
- Vash, enough!
- Come on! Let it go!
- You're a piece of shit, John!
- Do you hear me? You're a piece of shit!
- Come on!
Get off me, Tave!
Vash, you know, for you,
this whole thing we do
is a noble, noble, grand cause, Vash.
But the rest of us, we have to pay bills!
I have bills to pay.
You don't cover my ass.
You don't.
You'd leave me hanging out there.
Come on.
I’m telling you, Tave. I’m telling you, man.
You know when we met each other
in Desert Storm, we hated each other.
Veteran sergeant
and a green lieutenant, right?
So we solved it the old-fashioned way.
We took our discussion out behind
this house that was there before Abraham.
And it took everything that I had,
but I finally made that asshole
see it my way!
You know, in the olden days,
you strike an officer, it meant death.
But instead, that bastard saved my life
three different times.
And now this, man...
I don't know what to...
Come on.
Mabe baby, get me an analysis on these.
Sure.
Locator's a little weak. We need to
move fast before we lose the signal.
- Well, the blood will prove it.
- Prove what?
She's not talking to you. Just drive.
Porphyria.
The blood doesn't produce enough heme.
it causes all sorts of problems,
including mental instability.
Mental instability?
What do you mean, like, insanity?
Yeah.
Yup, it looks like your friend
from the Billings building has it.
Sir, wouldn't we be safer at your house?
That's where we'll go
after we pick up the device.
It's got a lot of normal elements.
But there's some...
There's some traces of chlordane
in it as well.
- Chlordane? What's that?
- It's a pesticide.
Hold on.
Looks like it's a pesticide. Was
discontinued by the U.S. government in 1976.
Could a porphyria patient
possibly use that as a treatment?
No, I wouldn't think so.
I should think it'd make it worse.
So, a factory, an old warehouse
that manufactured it, that's the site.
- That's where he could be staying.
- It's possible, yeah.
Tave, where's the locator taking us?
Towards the southeast part of town.
Bingo. The industrial section.
I think this porphyria guy
hasn't given up on Billings.
- I don't like this.
- We'll get the device and get out of here.
Give me a hand.
Brice, grab the other side.
No, Shawn, I can do this myself.
- Who are you talking to?
- My brother.
- You don't have a brother.
- Yes, I do!
- Brice, get this off of me.
- Shut up!
Don't do it!
- Okay. It's just a cell phone.
- Don't do it!
- It's just a cell phone. Okay.
- Put it down! Put it down!
Put it down!
Put it down!
- Brice!
- Shut up!
- Come here. Come here.
- Okay.
You see, Shawn?
I told you I could have her.
Yeah, I'm on Highway 26
moving toward the industrial section.
Move in.
I gotta take this.
Yeah?
The battery's already dying on this locator.
The best I can do is this area here.
It's maybe within a block or two.
Okay, cross-reference that section
for any of Billings' holdings.
You know, I’m not getting this.
Billings has another son who wants
to get even for something?
What does that have to do
with Kilmer and his thugs?
Maybe nothing.
- Mabe, you got that file on Billings?
- Yeah. It's right here.
it says here Billings only has one son.
All right, I’ve got it.
It's 1400 South Haskell.
It's an old warehouse and factory.
They used to make pesticides
with chlordane.
I've been noticing
the looks you've been giving me
We'd make such a great team.
You know what, Brice?
You're right. I have been looking at you.
You don't need the gun.
Oh, that's good.
All right, here's the latest copies
of the floor plan on file with the city.
That's probably 20 years old.
They're gonna be pissed
you're not working for them anymore.
They're gonna take back
more than their money.
Maggie's packing the kids up right now.
She won't even tell me where she's going.
You know, man, I’m no marriage counselor,
but it seems to me this relationship needs
more than just a quick infusion of cash.
You're right. You're no marriage counselor.
Is it too late, bro?
I don't know.
Hey.
I’m not giving you any reason
to take other money ever again.
We're almost there.
Yeah, copy.
There's only one child.
I don't know what Brice's been feeding you,
but he has no brother.
You want to stay here with Mabe
and the truck?
Hell, no.
All right, then.
Let's do this.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
Brice!
Vash.
I’m sorry, Dad. Let me give you a hand.
Shut up!
Get off!
- Oh! My leg!
- "Oh, my leg. " Shut up!
Comfy? Good.
Come on.
You don't know how to do this!
What is my I.Q.?
- What is my I.Q.?
- 182!
One hundred and eighty-two!
Do you really think
you could have succeeded without me?
I’m gonna wait here for Kilmer.
You guys secure the perimeter.
Nothing leaves that building.
You know what I learned, Dad?
I learned that porphyria
is treatable. Yeah.
You can't cure it. No, no, no, no.
But you can at least treat it!
Oh, but you knew that, didn't you?
- Please, Brice, no.
- You knew that
and you still locked him away
in the basement.
- Son, you have no brother.
- Look at him!
God, Dad.
All those years,
locked away in a basement.
You think that some food
and some freaking board games is enough?
I gave you everything you needed.
You were a difficult child to raise!
Your son, Dad! Your son!
You treated him
like an animal.
- Is there anyone else in there with him?
- I don't know.
- Does he have any other weapons?
- it all happened too quick, Vash.
Tave, threats unknown.
Find out what you can.
Copy that.
Mabe, you've got company. Lock it down.
Truck is going out.
Vash, I see five on the street.
Our friends are back.
Mabe, we've got two down at the truck.
The other two are trying to flank.
John, Mabe might have
more than she can handle.
- Tave, anything inside?
- Stand by.
Just Billings.
- I don't have a shot. I don't have a shot!
- Bye, bitch.
I count four down, plus a second SUV.
Might have two more.
You're lucky it didn't go through. Easy.
- Easy.
- it feels like it did.
Easy.
Yeah, Mabe took one.
She got hit in the vest.
Get her back to the truck.
Just give me a minute. I’ll be fine.
Oh, Christ, it stings like a bitch.
When was your first job with us?
Remember?
You remember your first job? Where was it?
Oh, God. Cardiff, Wales.
You were there. You know.
You didn't like me being there.
You didn't like the idea
of having an Irish girl on your team.
Yeah. Can you blame me?
All right, easy, easy.
I mean, you Irish and all.
You never lose your temper.
Just a little tough to get you riled up.
- I know.
- All right.
- All right.
- Go back to the truck.
- Lock yourself in.
- I want to stay here.
Don't come out.
Fine.
Brice!
Stop, please!
I had no help. No choice.
- Where is he?
- Where is who?
- You got a son nobody one knows about?
- No, just Brice.
He had a disease. I didn't know what to do.
He'd have been laughed at
if I’d have let him out.
That basement kept him safe.
I did it for him, not to him.
I even gave him personal tutors.
He's smart!
I did good.
"Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock
"The clock struck one"
"The mouse ran down"
That doesn't rhyme.
- Come on. We're getting out of here.
- No! We need to take this.
- Screw this device. We're leaving.
- No!
Drop your weapon.
Emily, what are you waiting for? Shoot him!
You know, I don't care what you're wearing,
that has got to hurt.
You know, Vash,
I never did get to answer your question
about a boyfriend.
- Let's go see if this thing works.
- Sounds good.
Yeah, you're in pain. Come on.
- it works three to four feet.
- That's about right.
No, I got this. I got it.
Yeah, that's fair
after you shot me three times.
She shot you twice, he shot you once.
I haven't shot you yet.
I was a political science major, asshole.
Not a math major.
Sit down.
I’ve got an FN 5.7 there.
That's armor-piercing.
You'd be dead
if I would've capped your ass.
You're gonna wish I was.
You should have let your partner
take my money.
Then we would have been done
with all of this.
Is it too late to change my mind?
Yeah, I think it is.
Well, all right, then.
Never saw your agenda.
That's fascinating,
because you were the one that taught me
in the personal agenda department, Vash.
Emily, I was wrong.
Vash. Did you ever think
that the only way to be truly free
is to die?
Brice, my son. I’m so sorry.
No, no.
Emily.
You got him.
Armor-piercing.
Tave! We've got a man down! Damn it, Vash.
You broke rule number one.
I didn't take bullet for a client.
John!
I don't know who's the bigger monster.
That freak
or the one that created him.
Why'd you do that?
I’m okay. I’ll be okay.
John. Your family.
You got to take care of your family.
Robert's got to turn pro.
Yeah, let him play, I know.
I know. He's just a kid.
You're right, I’m wrong.
And Mr. Billings, about that wire transfer.
Tave! Mabe! Get in here!
We've got a man down!
Hey, don't you go anywhere. Don't you go.
Don't you go. Don't you go.
Don't you go anywhere.
Get down.
We got five.
- Don't get so cocky, you hack.
- Just trying to earn a paycheck.
Hey, you got paid on the last job,
didn't you?
Copy that.
