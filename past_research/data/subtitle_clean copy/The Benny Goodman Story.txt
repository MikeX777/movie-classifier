Velma, I have a jumper for you.
Here's our new clarinetist Benny Goodman.
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.
VoiciJane.
- Hello, Benny.
He has What?
- Nothing, really. It's just that -...
Well, I did not know -
- You do not know what?
This is nothing.
It's just that I never had as a rider
boy shorts.
Well now it will not be necessary.
Say, it was great.
- Did you like it?
You definitely your own style, guys.
We play in the New Orleans style.
We are no different.
No partitions, no arrangements,
anything, huh?
Half these guys do not read.
- The solo, you improvise?
That's it. It swings,
and we play like we feel.
Playing as one feels.
The song you are playing, it has a name?
What, of course.'Dixieland One-Step'.
You've heard this kind of music?
A lot of guys up the river from New Orleans.
There, everyone plays like that.
Joe Oliver, Louis Armstrong,
Fletcher Henderson.
They are in Chicago?
- No, Henderson is in New York.
But Joe Louis and Chicago are here.
Say, I could play with you?
Dora,
what are you doing up so late?
What I always do? I work.
But you should go to bed.
The new baby arrives.
He?? needs clothes.
Clothes for babies do not grow on trees.
Jerome made me a deal.
Where did you get this money?
Benny.
- Benny?
Yes, he won the silver
playing with the orchestra.
He knows that you do not work,
so he gave me.
The new baby must have new clothes.
I'm worried about her, Dad.
You're worried about?
Oh, Benny is a good boy.
Yes, but I want it meet nice girls...
...asking with them as
Harry and Freddie, he dances with them.
But no, there is that play all the time.
It is not paid when we dance with the girls.
Where is Benny?
- It just came out.
What is Dora?
I hear playing up there all alone.
I'd better go talk to him.
What was he, Benny?
When something goes wrong, you go
always play like that.
What is it? Tell it to me.
I work Dad,
and a trip to California.
In California?
Ben Pollack launch an orchestra there...
...a band playing the kind of music
I want to play.
Gil Rodin wrote it.
He?? wants me to go. As Gil.
It has the best musicians.
And what kind of music you'll play, Benny?
Mozart, perhaps?
Bach?
- No, Dad. Of dance music.
But not the same old standard
arrangements.
Freestyle, where you can improvise,
where you can express.
And the high school, Benny?
You still have two years.
You do not learn music high school, Dad.
And that's what I want to do music.
But you learn other things, Benny.
These things are also important.
Not for me.
There is one important thing.
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
I was ready to go.
They paid the travel and everything.
But -.
But what?
I need a tuxedo.
So that's it.
A tuxedo, eh?
Benny, you'll have one.
- But, Dad -.
I talked to Mr. Strauss today.
I have work next week.
As soon as I start working -
- But smoking is very expensive.
No matter what it costs.
- You have so many other things -.
Regardless, Benny.
All these years...
...you wanted a lot like the other boys-...
...roller skates, baseball glove.
I could never pay you.
This time, for once,
I will pay you what you want.
Once I have my work,
get your tuxedo.
We could not shorten the sleeves?
Of course, we could shorten sleeves now.
But Benny, next year when you
will need them to be longer...
...there will be a fold here
that you can never remove.
'Ben Pollack and his Californians'
Well, what has happened?
Sorry, Ben. Je went to train.
It was five hours late.
And where Goodman?
- I'm Goodman.
You?
Okay guys, 'Waiting for Katie.'
One, two -.
What is the idea?
It is open to the Neopolitan tomorrow night.
Yes, I know.
You're not too smart,
just to get to Chicago?
Mom wrote me. They
a party for me. You know, just the family.
And you always wear an outfit
evening for family celebrations?
Dad gave me this tuxedo.
I just want to show him I grown up in it.
What there was, Harry?
This is Dad, Benny.
It was an accident.
Coming here.
He crossed the street.
You mean right now?
- There is just one hour.
By the time he arrives at the hospital -.
Does Mom know?
He was so excited that you're coming.
I, too, Mom.
Oh, and he did not see how
you grew, you are already a man.
'Coffee Neopolitan.'
You sure this is the right place?
- Sure.
But they were gangsters.
- Nonsense.
I appelleJohn Hammond. Ben Pollack
left a reservation for me.
John is a gambling den.
This is a speakeasy.
John, I'd like you Benny Goodman.
Bonjour. Je wanted to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my sister Alice.
- Enchanted.
Sit.
Ben, I had a long distance call
Willard Alexander.
He has work for an orchestra
heats. Club 50.
How'd you like to play in New York.?
- A gala in New York?
This is the chance we expected -
to play again our style.
But the stuff that warm
do not seem to happen.
We did a lot of flops from California.
This is why we stick to the standard
arrangements.
But Ben.
- Well, this may be our chance.
Exactly. Call it immediately.
Go ahead, before he changes his mind.
- Well, okay.
Excuse us, please.
We saw these men when we arrived.
They really seem to gangsters.
These are gangsters.
Can not find scary to play here?
Do not get us.
They pay us very well.
Why?
'S Girlfriend PetitJake loves our music.
This is the owner of the box.
Your brother is an agent?
An Agent? You mean like
paris to take to the racetrack?
No, this is a bookmaker.
Is an agent galas for orchestras.
This is how he earns his money.
John tries to help orchestras.
But it always seems to cost him money.
You live in Chicago?
New York. Je am here for the opera
at Ravinia, I'm at my aunt.
Like music that heater?
- Oh no, not at all.
So what are you doing here?
I just came
empêcherJohn of getting into trouble.
It works. You have the date.
You go to New York.
Seriously?
- It's late. We should go.
Good evening.
Good luck, guys. See you tomorrow.
- Yes, later, John.
Hammond has found us a date
at Club 50 in New York.
But we have a problem.
How are we going from here?
Just tell him you are going.
This is a free country.
If PetitJake is upset,
we never get out alive from here.
It would not do that.
- What makes you think that?
Maybe if we played badly -
- They would not hear the difference.
You could talk to his girlfriend,
what it's called?
You know what happened to the last guy
auquelJake saw address.
Can only go talk to Jake
and appeal to his better feelings.
Yes, but who will do it?
- Not you, Ben?
It seems not.
He?? can not stand him myself.
You really saw Jake?
- Yes, once. That was enough.
I will. This is too much luck to pass.
You mean now?
- At worst, it can only kill me.
Pass this door. Good luck, kid.
Thank you.
If I'm not back after
the next pass, tell my mother.
Where you think you going, son?
- I wanted voirJake.
Oh, really? And who are you?
- One of the guys in the band.
The boss is very busy. He did not
the time to talk to the musicians.
Oh, well maybe you should leave decide.
There is a guy in the orchestra here,
he says he wants to see the boss.
What's your name?
- Benny Goodman.
Okay.
This is the musician, boss.
- What do you want?
Ben Pollack wanted me to tell you.
Why he did not come himself?
He was afraid.
- Why he chose to send you?
He did not choose.
I volunteered.
You know me not, I thought you do not
liquideriez me too quickly.
I hope I'm right.
Well, what is your problem, son?
We were offered a job in New York.
This is a great opportunity for us,
and we want to go.
What is it?
Do not likeable here?
Oh yes, of course.
I enjoy it well.
They have nothing in New York that has
not here. You make a big mistake.
Hey, you look familiar to me.
Benny Goodman.
I also heard that name.
No, you have me confused
with someone else.
I play clarinette. Je'm it since I was a kid.
You lived in Francisco Avenue?
Oh yes, indeed.
This is what I thought.
You played hockey without skates.
You are Jake Primo.
You turn me stones.
I've come a long way since, is not it?
Yes. Oh yes, a very long way.
So you want to go play for the
crafty Broadway, huh?
The sides, boss?
Sammy, take care guys orchestra.
So?
- How he took?
I do not know. He just said,
'Take care guys.'
What is it?
- A farewell party.
Good luck and best wishes from the boss.
Yes, sir.
- New York, here we are.
'Club Trombone Teddy Wilson at the Piano.'
Good evening.
Hi, Benny.
Hi. Excuse me.
Sit.
- Thank you, John. Hi, Gene.
This is my sister Alice.
- Bonsoir. Je am Benny Goodman.
Teddy is wonderful, is not it?
- Oh, great.
Like the music that heater?
Oh no, not at all.
- So what are you doing here?
I just came empêcherJohn
getting into trouble.
Say, we're not -.
No, I do not think so.
Hi, Benny. You work?
- Some dates, Ted.
You can not live on.
- You should have stayed with Pollack.
It is finished here in New York,
but he is doing very well on tour.
Ajouer the same old
standard arrangements.
I learned that
Kel Murray had really offered you money.
I refused, Gene.
- Denied? Why?
For the same reason I left Ben Pollack.
I want an orchestra playing music
heater, really taking off.
Where he play? There is no place
except Harlem for such an orchestra.
Yes, as Fletcher Henderson always says...
'orchestras that heat is
cold meat in this city.'
I do not know.
It's never been tried.
Ever tried?
And Pollack and others?
Not like I think.
I have some ideas.
I do not know if they are crazy -
- What kind of ideas?
These are musical ideas.
I can not put words on it.
But when we play together in a box as
here and we improvise...
...people enter,
they sit and they listen.
The reason they listen,
is the way we play.
Oh sure, they love it.
They are just not enough.
But if we played so they can also
dance instead of just listen -...
You could have something.
- You'll assemble your own band?
Looks like I should.
Be practical, Benny.
You do not win a penny.
What can you expect?
Some recordings? A ball in college?
Dance dance or not, nobody wants
of this kind of music.
I though.
- I know, but it's hopeless.
This is a foolish dream.
Do not be like that.
I can not help myself. A later.
Oh, pleased to have
made your acquaintance.
This is one of the greatest clarinetists,
and most stubborn.
John, all the musicians that heat
are not Paganini.
In fact, Benny is one.
Oh, come on.
One day I'll prove it.
Well, I must say...
Benny has his own strange integrity.
I admire him for that.
'Telephone Message - Call 21 Hours 30
Chicago - Operator 183.'
Hello. Harry? Something wrong?
No, it's about Mom.
What is it, Mom?
- This is his state of mind, Benny.
It depresses more..
There is no one at home
now, and I just Irving.
She does not know what to do
of his time. It worries me.
We thought maybe
she should go live with Ida.
No, Ida must deal his own family.
Maybe she needs
change. Take her to New York.
And money, Benny?
I'll send you.
An apartment can be found.
You always work.
I play the bass. Maybe you could find me
something.
Do not worry. Mom takes
and your bass. As soon as you can.
Okay. Cheers, Benny.
Okay.
Enter.
Hi, John.
- Hi, Benny.
You remember Willard Alexander.
- Yes. How are you?
I talked to Willard your idea.
- What an idea?
In a new orchestra. It seems very excitant.
J 'd like to hear more.
Another time.
For the moment, it's just an idea.
This is the new band?
- This is some arrangements.
I spoke with Deane Kincaide
and George Baseman...
...we came together,
and we worked on some ideas.
You do not want to talk about?
- Another time.
For now, I guess I have find work.
A job that pays well.
With Kel Murray.
Why? What has happened?
A lot. My family,
lots of complications...
...the price of train,
and apartments, and -.
So far,
orchestra will have to wait.
When you're ready, tell me.
- Thank you, Willard.
You work on it, Benny?
The Mozart concerto, yes.
Professor Schoepp would be proud.
I wondered if you'd do me a favor, Benny?
My family organizes
musical evenings at home.
Just classic stuff, of course.
They are one in two weeks.
A small group of strings.
They play 'Concerto for Clarinet'
and I want a clarinetist.
Why do you want me to do?
- I have my reasons.
I need some repetition.
- Oh, this is not official.
Look, if you do, I invite
your friends to support you morally.
I guess I need it.
Alice will be there?
Well, yes. Why?
- No raison. Je just wondering.
It can not be here.
This is a mansion.
This is right here, Mom.
Come. It is late.
I am Mr. Goodman.
- Second door on the right, sir.
Thank you.
This is something.
People live here?
This is a home?
- Sure. What do you think?
I think it is a museum.
Come on, Mom.
This poor woman.
What a poor woman?
Who every day must be dust in this place.
Come.
Benny, there you are.
- Good evening. Sorry to be late.
Father, here Benny Goodman.
- Delighted, Mr. Hammond.
Enchanted. Glad you're here.
- Thank you.
Here are my mother and my brother Harry.
Glad to make your acquaintance.
Here is my cousin Mrs. Vanderbilt.
Enchanted.
- Likewise.
You play my favorite concerto.
- It's mine too.
We will find you a good place, Ms.
Goodman. There?
Thank you.
It's almost ready.
I am to you in a minute.
Okay, John.
Stretch-steep, Ben.
- Plays well, Benny.
I'll see you later.
Well, good night.
- Good evening.
Do you like classical music?
- Yes, very much.
Well, I had no idea.
- I'll even play.
Really?
You're the Goodman?
- Yeah.
This was the idea DeJohn?
Yes, he asked me.
Where is he? I want to talk to him.
I'm sorry.
John, this is outrageous.
I could not be more upset.
Outrageous? What?
To request Benny Goodman playing.
Do you realize what you're doing?
I know exactly what I'm doing.
With family, you snub those musicians
because they play in nightclubs.
This is a good way to show you.
- You said that it was for that?
He knows that the other musicians
are professionals Philharmonic?
He played with professionals.
John, really.
It is high time that you stop being such a
snob for music.
You're shocked that a musician that heats
come here to play Mozart.
Not tout. Je am shocked that you
a friend exposed to such humiliation.
Do not worry, Alice.
It will not be humiliated.
Oh yes, it is.
I wish I could stop it.
Well, you can not.
In fact, I'll get it started.
Looks like they are preparing.
- In two minutes, guys.
They are all Philharmonic.
But Mr. Goodman -
I have no idea where it comes from.
It is Chicago.
This was a pupil of Professor Schoepp.
Oh? Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is water.
It will be terrible for him,
Père. Je know.
Oh, I hope not.
With his mother here -.
His mother? Where?
Right there in second place.
Ms. Goodman? I am Alice Hammond.
Really delighted to know you.
It does not look very nervous,
is not it?
No, he is not.
I was just saying to Harry,
if only his father was there...
...when Benny plays good music.
Bravo, Benny.
- Thank you, John.
You're going to eat something.
- And how.
Bravo, Benny.
- Really good, buddy.
Mr. Goodman, I've never heard
rondo played better.
Yes, it is bad with the licorice stick.
Benny, I think you swinguais tonight.
You really think so? I thought
he played brilliantly.
Thank you.
I guess we should learn a little
gibberish to these classics.
Mr. Goodman.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Certainly.
I owe you an apology.
Apology? Why?
When you told me you were going to play
, I was pretty upset.
In fact, I told John that I thought of him
you have requested.
Really? Why?
To be honest, I thought
would be very embarrassing for us...
...and humiliating for you.
This is why you went sit with Mom?
Yes.
Well, it was really considerate of you.
You fascinate me.
Someone who plays both you...
...can devote to this strange and unpopular
popular music.
I do not understand.
- You do not understand this music.
You are absolutely right.
- Have you ever tried?
Sure. She's just strong.
- Like many symphonies.
But it has nothing simple nor
melodic as chamber music.
It can be I want to show you one
day if you wanted to listen..
Although sûr. Je'm not such a snob,
despite what ditJohn.
John said that your idea of?? a musician,
is a guy who plays at Carnegie Hall.
This is true.
You are the exception.
You are quite eloquent,
is not it?
Huh? Nobody ever told me that.
Oh, the music, not the words.
- Oh, I see what you mean.
You completely mistaken.
You so quiet and tranquil air...
...and then all the emotion that pours.
I do not remember have been moved.
It was not me. It was Mozart.
This is Benny Goodman.
Who you thought it was?
- Benny Goodman.
This is an orchestral clarinetist
dance. The friend DeJohn.
I do not believe it.
Benny with such a band.
This is what he does, you said that
played in dance bands.
You do not understand.
- Certainly not.
Hi, Alice.
- Hello, Benny.
Roger Gillespe, Benny Goodman.
- Enchanted.
Will you sit down?
- No, merci. Je not have time.
You disappoint me.
- I disappoint you? Why?
This is the kind of music
you do not like, is not it?
Certainly.
Well, I was hoping you
you would hold to your convictions.
My beliefs have not changed.
I am afraid you have it hurts.
I'm sure.
Like I said -.
I'm sorry.
Your friend is late.
You're finally ready, Mr. Goodman?
I do not usually have to wait musicians.
No one is indispensable,
you know?
I warn you,
it does not happen again.
It will not happen again.
What it goes.
Yes, indeed.
I'm terribly uncomfortable.
- Why?
There was work.
Now he has his convictions.
I am afraid of being to blame.
'NBC Selects New Band
Issue for New Dance.'
'NBC is interested in a program
Dance 3:00 Saturday night.'
'Cugat and Kel Murray are already
selected for 3 new format orchestras.'
'The Network seeks a third orchestra.'
Excuse me. Would you mind
go to page 24?
This is very important.
Well, it sounds good.
Look, we could play together
all the time, play as you want.
This is why I made you come.
- What do you mean?
Install our own orchestra.
- It's hopeless, Benny.
I know we're unlikely,
but you can get a hearing.
NBC looking for a swing band, and
Willard told them about me.
He convinced them that I could mount a
very different orchestra.
They will listen to us.
If you like, there will be a hearing.
You mean, it would just
audition for a hearing?
Benny, do not be like that.
- How you gonna do?
Here's how.
Deane Kincaide and George Baseman...
...gave me some special arrangements.
They knew what I wanted,
and they gave me.
They gave us plenty of room for
improvise and find our own riffs.
So guys, what you say?
It looks pretty good.
I am with you, Benny.
- Me too.
Okay, let's get to work.
I have only one suggestion to, Benny.
If you have to become a conductor,
you should change the name.
Why?
Who will remember a name
like 'Benny Goodman'?
'Let's Dance.'
This was 'Valse Brillante',
played by Kel Murray and his orchestra.
Good music of the old tradition.
And now a brand new
orchestra, with a brand new style.
Thanks Kel Murray, and welcome
Benny Goodman and his orchestra.
Where that, boss?
Anywhere, Ed I just want to listen.
And so ends our program tonight.
We hope you find us
at the same time next Saturday.
I heard your music tonight
radio and I came to congratulate you.
Thank you.
- I'm Fletcher Henderson.
Mr. Henderson, I can not tell
you what it means for me.
We listen to your records since we
were kids. Your band is the best.
It plays for 15 years.
We had good times and bad,
but never bored.
I began to think that nobody ever pierce.
Then I heard you tonight.
I think you have a chance.
Really?
You really have the feeling...
...as Oliver, Dodds, and Louis...
...all the guys from New Orleans.
But you something different again.
This is why I think you could drill.
And I want to help you.
- Are you serious?
If you need arrangements,
I need money.
Wonderful.
Heaven is really a great opportunity.
And now, a new arrangement
Fletcher Henderson.
'Typing Stand at the Savoy'.
' Eastern Time.'
' Central Time.'
' Time of the Rocky Mountains.'
' Pikes Peak Chalet.'
' Pacific Time.'
' Southern California'

Well, how was it?
Formidable Benny. Formidable.
What was he, Willard?
Well, we finished in three weeks.
They do not include us.
Really?
- Why?
The plant closes.
They do not make cookies,
then they do not want to sell.
Well then, it's over. I knew.
Just when it worked well.
- More Goodman Orchestra.
Not necessarily.
We still have a good chance.
How? What do we do next?
Well, these emissions caused some
interest, especially in the west.
I investigated a bit.
Could perhaps organize a tour.
Starting when?
- Two months, maybe.
This is good. It just started.
Repeat still does not hurt.
Of course, it is. There are
How are we going to eat?
People always tell me how drink musicians.
But you guys, you do eating.
You will be happy again we have.
- Not at all.
This is like the good old days.
Full children to feed.
You will feed him as well?
- No, not always.
And they do not help like you.
Some were babies.
Thank you. You will be
happy to return to work?
At work? Benny us repeat
four to five hours a day.
You are very demanding, Benny?
If you want to be good, you have to work.
I would say that about him.
It is the most demanding of himself.
Nice to see you.
- How are you?
Good evening.
- Nice to see you.
Thank you.
You know everybody, right?
Yes. Hi, Teddy.
Come on, guys.
I have your favorite pudding.
Wonderful.
- Good evening.
Good evening. What are you doing here?
I asked John to come.
- Really?
Oui. Je wanted to see what was happening
one of your musical evenings.
Also, I wanted to see you.
Do you want to sit?
You know we go?
Yes, I know.
Are you looking for how long?
Well, we did some evenings
that will lead us to Denver.
Here we play Elitch's Gardens
for four weeks.
Then in August, we're going to
Palomar Los Angeles.
It will make four or five months.
Five months?
I will miss you, Benny.
Are you serious?
Yes, I am.
I was hoping you would call me.
I wanted. But -
- But what?
Well, you do not go with jazz musicians -.
No, I do not go either
with doctors or lawyers.
I go out with people - people I like.
I never know how to take.
Really?
Well, it was really hard to understand
, is not it?
I do not know. In a way, we -.
Yet, one can not help
to be attracted to one another.
Why?
This is perhaps because is so different.
Could not be more different.
- I do not know how.
Music, family, personality.
It's funny, is not it?
No. No, it's not funny.
This is strange and confusing, and -.
I wish I could tell you how much I-.
Do me a favor. Want
just sit there and listen?
Eb, Ted. Okay, Gene?
It is, is not it Mom?
- Good? Who is right?
Oh yes, she is a girl high.
No frills, no nonsense, just like everyone.
But Harry, I have a terrible
feeling in the pit of stomach.
What is he, Mom?
- This is Alice.
I fear she falls in love Benny.
But Mom, I thought you liked it.
The Queen Of England
could please me, if I met...
...provided but she
did not marry my Benny.
Benny, it was wonderful.
I loved.
It was beautiful. It was like - like Mozart
spontaneous.
It was not Mozart. That was me.
'Ohio House - The Best
Dancing Dinners Columbus.'
What is this?
Something new that present in the tour.
The Benny Goodman Trio.
What is this story?
Listen, I pay for the whole orchestra,
and I intend to have it.
You have the whole
orchestra Mr. McHenshey,
it is something more.
Nothing more. Eleven types
sitting there not making a sound.
'Benny Goodman and his Orchestra.'
This is the Goodman Orchestra?
- That's it.
Formidable I'm Joe Goldcrown,
director. Proud to have you here.
I heard you on the show
Dansons You were great..
Thank you.
- Let me tell you.
You play the best waltzes
I have ever heard.
It will be a great night again.
I have a feeling.
'Elitch's Garden
Benny Goodman and his Orchestra.'
'First it Soir.'
What do you call this piece?
It has a name?
'Meeting at South Camp.'
You do not play tangos, guys?
No, Mr. Clark.
And comic numbers?
You do not have funny hats?
No, we did not.
- There was a guy at the casino.
He melons gold, musical saws
, really good stuff.
And he carries all cases.
You do not want a band,
but a circus with three tracks.
'Dancing Palomar.'
'Tonight Only
B. Goodman and his Orchestra.'
This is the worst markets.
The orchestra can play an evening.
One night, it's better than nothing.
This is worse. If you are
not good enough to play-.
Mr. Goodman, you signed a contract,
and I'll stick to it.
It has a nice crowd on Saturday night,
whatever the orchestra.
I can not have Dennis until Monday
night, and I need an orchestra.
Suppose we refuse?
We're stuck, Benny.
It takes us to his thank you.
Do not make me a bully.
I can not decide which band attracts
the world or not. This is the public.
Likes you or not.
- You decided not.
Who you trying to fool?
I talked to Clark in Denver.
It not let us play our securities.
- That's what he told me.
This is not a fool, and I do not either.
I'm not going to let them play.
At what time do we start?
- Doors open at 8:00.
Hi, Alice.
- Hello, Willard.
This is our last night, guys.
It was gathered to play our music
. But nobody wants.
We will play tonight
whether they like it or not.
We will do all our headlines.
It begins with 'Skipping a Time.'
Why do they stay up there?
What is happening?
I've never seen it on a dance floor.
But they are just standing.
They do not dance.
What happens?
The kids are crazy about this band.
You've hit the jackpot, boss.
Well, gosh.
I can not do it overnight.
I have writer's cramp.
Thank you.
- A last, Mr. Goodman.
Okay.
I guess they close. I'm sorry.
Heaven, we waited all this time.
- I have all your records.
I'll meet you outside.
- Come on, kids. It's getting late.
Out in a minute.
- Come on, kids. Here we go.
I tried to see you after the first pass-.
I know. It does not matter.
You must be exhausted.
- Yes. Instead.
Hey, what a night.
It could not be more wonderful.
How do you explain that?
What has happened?
I guess kids have heard the broadcast
Dansons.
It happened three hours earlier here.
Many also said they had our records.
They were expecting us,
but we do not know.
But what are you doing here in L.A.?
I learned what happened during your tour.
Willard said he was afraid that
the orchestra disintegrates.
I grew that this evening would be
another humiliation.
I knew how you would feel.
I just wanted to be there.
It was wonderful of you, Alice.
You brought us luck.
- Benny Goodman, you're an idiot.
How can you say such a thing?
You've worked years to form an orchestra.
You repeated, struggled, you almost
died of hunger to make it work.
When it finally happens, you call it
luck. Nothing is more absurd.
I guess that's true in a sense -
- You won a standing ovation tonight.
I never heard him play well -
energy and rhythm.
The kids could not help but be excited.
You've never played
'Skipping a Time' like that.
It was two times better than the disc.
The disk? You heard the album?
Do not be idiot. Je have them all.
Really?
- I listen all the time.
You mean you love them.
I am a fan of Benny Goodman.
Well, you have changed, Alice.
- Certainly.
This is great,
but I do not understand.
You, Alice Hammond, a fan of swing.
What has happened?
This is pretty obvious, is not it?
I'm in love with you, Benny.
I guess you know my feelings, Alice.
I do not have the vaguest idea.
You're serious?
I assumed you knew -
I do not see how you could -...
...you trying to say
that you love me, Benny?
Well, I could not be more surprised.
I thought you knew why I said nothing.
It took all my money
to keep the orchestra, and my family -.
Please Benny,
do not try to explain.
I did not say I wanted to marry you
or leak on a deserted island.
I just said that I love you.
I might as well get over it.
Maybe even both.
I guess it would be much simpler, is not it?
I do not bet.
- Me neither.
This is why I told you.
I could hide from my family...
And friends, but I knew I could never
you hide.
Alice, you're wonderful.
- It is you who are wonderful.
Incredibly,
desperately wonderful.
I'm afraid I will never forget you.
As long as I live.
I guess we're in the same boat.
Alice, I -...
...sais. Je I know, my poor Benny.
It means so many things...
...and not clarinet to say.

Good.
You know what a guy said on the island?
On a clear day you can see America.
I'm cold. A drink?
- What are you having?
Scotch and soda?
- Okay.
Let two.
- Say six.
Yes, sir.
Six scotch and soda, immediately.
You can eat something?
- Sure.

Okay.
- Do you have time?
We have a lot of time.
- So this is paradise.
This is a great life.

And now we play again for nothing.

- What you eat, friends?
What is it?
- Chili is the fastest. It cooks.
You are also the cook?
- This is me.
The chili is good,
and coffee, please.
Same for everyone?
Well, you're not Benny Goodman,
the guy who plays Palomar?
What do you do in San Pedro?
- We just play Avalon.
Catalina, eh?
The chili comes immediately.
This must be a pretty busy guy -
bartender, waiter, cook.
Speaking of busy guy, you'll be, Benny.
This is signed with the Congress Hotel,

Being committed every night
from here to Chicago.
And New York?
- They are also interested.
Wonderful.
No New York. When heated, it is

We stay on the road touring.
At least that way we eat.
Yes, sir. Ýt comes.
And the coffee later.
You really have a show here?
Course. The next starts in two minutes.
Ladies and gentlemen. Our orchestra

But instead,
I am very pleased...
...to present our featured artist...
...vibraphonist first class...
Lionel Hampton.
My first song is in honor
of our special guest...
And this small town famous
there Catalina...
...they just visited.
You really fell in love him, is not it?
You did not think wrong.
There you should see your face
when he plays.
And you know how long?
When you asked me back here with you...
I did not think you had fallen in love
climate of California.
Of all the incredible romances -
You and Benny Goodman.
I know.
I think we're going from here
with something new.
As the Quartet Benny Goodman?
You EXPLODED me, man.
'Benny Goodman comes home.'
'Chicago Pays Tribute
to the King of Swing.'
'Orchestra and Goodman Quartet

There is someone here
who wants to see you...
..., Benny.
Kid Ory.
Congratulations, Benny. You managed.
- Thank you.
You have the best orchestra
I have ever heard anywhere.
This is the best compliment
I have ever heard anywhere.
Thank you.
Fletcher, you want to hold this,
please? A later, Kid.
Hello, Benny.
- Hello, Alice.
I was hoping you would show you.
I had the intuition.
It's been two months.
I could not go.
I know. It seems rather two years.
I was hoping that you come to New York.
- A New York?
I can not pursue you across the
pays. Je running out of excuses.
What's your excuse this time?
- I visited my aunt.
She also lives in a museum?
No, his house is rather like a barn car.
And New York, Benny?
Too many unpleasant memories.
Thank you.
- I do not mean you, Alice.
I mean failures we encountered there.
This is our city of bad luck.
I do not want to close.
Suppose I stop following you. And then?
So I will come to New York, I guess.
'Goodman Orchestra Opens
Paramount New York.'
'Music is a Swing Boom'.
I'm sorry.
The traffic was terrible.
I began to think that you
are not going to come.
Benny, it's wonderful to see you.
I seldom happens to believe.
When did you come?
Last week.
Last week?
Why did not you call me?
I was terribly busy, Alice.
- Too busy for a phone call?
No, there were other things.
I should have called you, but -.
What there was, Benny?
This first in New York.
We tried three times here
and had three times failed.
When we left, our orchestra
could not complete the Trombone Club.
Now they have committed ourselves to
Paramount Theater.
I do not like the idea of?? playing
front of thousands of empty seats.
So that is why you wanted to see me.
Do you think the first
tomorrow will be a new humiliation.
Well - yes.
You had intended to come
to Paramount, Alice?
No, I would not come.
Well, I was hoping you'd be there for us as
luck.
I have a dinner.
We spend 10 hours in the morning.
10 am?
No wonder you're worried
about empty seats.
Okay Benny. J 'will be there.
I'll be the little black dot ranked 20th.
We get on well,
is not it, Alice?
When we're together,
I feel so relaxed and so comfortable.
Well, my God.
Coming from you Benny,
it is a real explosion.
You know something, Benny Goodman?
I've never been alone with you, even in
lounge.
This is still in nightclubs,
or parties, or such places.
I wonder how it would be, an evening
with you in front of the fireplace.
I guess I'll never know.
Alice, I've been thinking.
And -
- Really?
I want to tell you something.
You come backstage after
the first show tomorrow?
We take breakfast,
and we'll talk.
I'd love to, but...
...you could not try to say now?
There is a rehearsal in ten minutes.
I have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
The film is almost finished.
Everyone is there?
Okay, you go up.
- Thank you.
One, two, three, four.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Miss Alice.
Alice, what happened to you?
- Nothing, Father.
Where were you?
At Paramount Theater.
At Paramount Theater?
What happens there?
Oh, Father. You have no idea.
Certainly not.
Why go to a movie on a Thursday morning?
Because Benny asked me.
Benny Goodman. He began
there this morning...
...with his orchestra.
Father, you've never seen such a
crowd as excited of your life.
It could not be more electrifying.
They danced in the aisles -.
And that's what you did?
Well, not intentionally.
Benny Goodman.
Young man could be a good musician.
What a mess.
Oh, no. There were thousands of people.
They shouted and cheered.
Oh, no. I do not call it a mess.
There was such a crowd,
I could not approach him.
I have to send him a telegram.
Western Union, please.
This is so urgent?
Here 81098 Butterfield.
I want to send a telegram to Mr.
Benny Goodman...
...in care of Paramount Theater,
New York.
I'm bruised for attending this humiliation.
I could not approach me.
I am transported with admiration...
and exhausted.
Love, Alice.
Yes, thank you.
'Affectionately'?
Yes Father, affectionately.
'Transported admiration and exhausted.
Love, Alice.'
'Fondly,' already.
This is an expression.
- Jazz and swing, I do not know.
But love I know, Benny.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and Alice.
- Another time?
I had seven son,
but you're not like the others.
With them, I can talk. But I still say
I have in mind.
Mom, we go in five minutes.
It's been a long time I see
what happens between you and Alice.
This is not right, Benny.
This is like a knife in my heart.
You should not be feeling this way.
- How can I help myself?
I have to go now.
I guess that's better anyway not talk.

Benny, what happens there? I thought
you did that was leaving in months.
The studio called. They want us.
Other arrive Wednesday.
You're gone how long?
- Two or three months.
And we, Benny?
Alice, you know my feelings.
I thought about it.
What kind of life would be
for a girl like you?
I would travel all the time,
working every night.
These are excuses, not reasons.
Last call, flight 214.
All aboard, please
- I guess I have to go..
Goodbye Alice.
Thank you for coming.
Come. We will miss the plane.
Come. Let's go.
I will never understand this guy.
You're his brother, Harry.
Do not you understand?
I do not know.
Sometimes I think I understand.
About you, Alice.
This is just that -.
What Benny did not need
anyone or anything.
Aside from his music.
Everyone needs someone even Benny.
He discovered.
I just feel...
...there was something else.
What do you mean, Harry?
I mean Mom.
I like Ms. Goodman. He?? knows.
I think he likes me.
This is why I do not sleep at night.
You know?
Does Benny told you about?
With Benny, we're not talking
such things. You must know.
I know. That's why I came Mrs. Goodman.
I was hoping you could help me.
Benny wants to marry me.
He?? almost wonder -.
If you want to ask,
why does it not?
I thought you might perhaps tell me.
You're a good girl, Alice.
You make a good wife for a man.
But not for my Benny.
Why, Ms. Goodman?
Because we do not mix
caviar and bagels, that's why.
I always hoped that Benny box
he finds the right girl -.
How do you know he has not found?
I like Ms. Goodman.
What reason I might have...
...apart to make him happy?
Do you think I could not?
You're still young, Alice.
Benny too.
This is easy to speak of happiness.
It's not so easy to live.
You'll find out one day.
But then it will be too late.
I'm sorry you think that, Ms. Goodman.
And your family,
they do not think the same thing?
Strangely, no.
They admire Benny.
They know that I love him.
I think they would be very happy.
I do not understand.
But I understand now lot.
I had no idea you had these feelings.
I am very glad to know.
One more thing, Ms. Goodman.
Needless you inquiéter. Jamais
I ask Benny to marry me.
If it does, it will be because he wants.
Will need it to come from him.
Alice, do not expect something...
...that will never come perhaps.
I do not have the intention.
I do it for too long.
'Tray 22'.
I just saw Wynn Nathanson.
He?? had a great idea.
What would you give
a concert in Carnegie Hall?
Carnegie Hall?
I do not think so.
It works just fine.
It would be the pinnacle of your career.
Maybe. Definitely a big step.
Not just for us but for all music heats.
A sign of acceptance.
- Exactly.
You could have the best,
not only our own orchestra.
Make a real jazz concert.
It would meet all those who say that the
swing is only a flash in the pan.
I know someone who thinks
it is a great idea - Alice.
His idea of?? a musician has always been
a guy who plays at Carnegie Hall.
'Carnegie Hall
Benny Goodman and his Orchestra.'
'Tomorrow Night.'
It will be fine, guys.
The saxes, the letter F...
...a little less strong, okay?
Ira. Five-minute break.
Sounds great, Benny.
- Thank you.
You look tired.
You slept on the plane?
A little. You can get me two tickets?
There are no more tickets. It's been
three days that everything is sold.
It has even sitting on the stage.
- Complete?
What do I do?
This is for my mother.
I try a peddler.
- All the seats are taken.
And not by kids,
not at these prices.
A room full of lovers of classical music.
People who have never heard
our kind of music.
You're taking an awful risk.
You know it, Benny?
We should have taken more time.
We need more than a repetition.
I know, but everyone is busy.
Where Lionel and HarryJames?
Do not worry. They will be there.
I should never have start me there.
If you're so worried, you can cancel.
There is still time.
We'll go through.
All your reputation is at stake, Benny.
Do not take such a risk.
Do not be like that.
Tell Benny, must
program go to the printers.
Must finish the layout.
For example, what is going to open?
Let.
Perhaps the new air that comes to
. The trick Edgar Sampson.
It could be very good.
- How you gonna call?
Why not 'Do not be like that?'
This is what I heard in my life.
When I try something new,
someone says, 'Do not be like that.'
This is new concert.
It could be a good idea to open.
Where is Alice? I have not had a chance to
call.
I do not know.
I have not seen for ten days.
I thought she would be there.
She always wanted me to
play at Carnegie Hall.
Yes, hello?
Sorry to wake Mr. Hammond,
I wanted to talk to Alice.
Who is this?
Alice is not in town, Benny.
It is with my sister in Vermont.
Oh, I see.
Something wrong?
No, not exactly.
I was just hoping -.
You come to the concert tomorrow night?
Yes, John took me tickets.
Hammond, do you know
when Alice will return?
Not until two weeks, I'm sure.
She went there a few days.
She is aware of the concert?
Yes, Benny I'm sure she is.
Thank you.
Benny, tell me.
What is the problem?
Mom, it's too cold outside for you.
This is the concert?
This is what worries you?
The last time you played
like that, it was for your father.
What is it?
Will not you tell me?
This is Alice, is not it?
This is because it is a party.
Mom -
- You do not need to talk.
I understand.
I did not understand, but now I understand.
I want you to be happy.
It was not just you, Mom.
That was me.
I guess I was too busy.
I did not realize -.
This is a good girl, Benny...
...and she loves you.
Girls like Alice does not grow on trees.
Certainly not.
It's too late now, I suppose.
Can être. Je do not know.
I know that.
If you want it, it will ask.
She will never ask you.
Long distance?
Yes please,
I would talk to a lady named...
Miss Alice Hammond, in Vermont.
Oh, his number? Yes, I have.
His father gave it to me.
'Soloist HarryJames.'
The result seems to be a history.
It's called 'Twenty Years deJazz'.
'Soloists Martha Tilton and Ziggy Elman'
You smile.
And the angels sing.
Although this is a soft murmur...
...beginning.
We kiss.
And the angels sing .
Leaving their music.
Ding in my heart.
Carnegie Hall, please.
This is something called 'Sing, Sing, Sing.'
'Dancing Palomar.'
Fourth row?
- On the driveway.
Do not worry, Alice.
It will ask you.
He asks me now.
'End'.
