Me too! l wrote C...
C is my lucky letter for the year.
So you wrote C for all the answers?
Yeah! That's what l did! All Cs.
Are you serious?
Yes!
Very good, Sonia.
l'm convinced you will become
a top model. Ask me why?
Why?
You're empty in
the top floor of your head.
Shut up, Jugs!
At least l can wear a sexy
dress for tonight's party.
What about you?
You eat so much all day
that you don't fit into your
pants by the end of the day.
Elastic bands, baby. l'm fat,
but l'm still so happy
Look at you... skinny!
You're a sub-size zero...
and you're still unhappy.
lt's a miracle
Don't be mean, Jugs.
She's just careful
about what she eats.
What does she eat?
Eat something once in a while,
Sonia... seriously.
We have to turn off the
fans because of you...
what if you fly away?
l won't fly away...
you are such a huge
paperweight on this planet.
Hey, keep away from my weight.
Chill ya, why do you guys
keep fighting all the time?
Come on
So? Do we make out or what?
C'mon, we've been friends
for over ten years now...
this is cool.
And plus, it's fun.
Here, now eat some.
You wanna know what's really fun?
What?
The exams are over!
EEEEEYAAAHOOO
And tonight, we're gonna
see Freddie Kapoor Live...
ln front of our own eyes...
He's so cute!
l know.
Have you decided what
you're going to wear?
lt's your birthday tonight, right?
Wear your birthday suit...
Luv Nanda will like that a lot.
Enough! You've started
with your Luv Nanda again.
l'm telling you
Babe, he's bad news.
And l'm telling you,
he's my boyfriend.
He's the son of a smuggler.
Jugs, his dad's a businessman.
Veerappan was also a businessman.
Jugs, we had decided
that we wouldn't interfere.
Chuck it.
C'mon, ya.
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,
What the hell are you doing?
You're stalking me again? What is it?
WHAT lS lT?
Will you talk?
TELL ME.
Oh!
Get out.
What a freak dude?
Seriously man.
Stalker.
He's your neighbour, right?
Keep him in check
Else he'll get beaten again.
l guess he's comes here for just that.
l think you turn him on.
Ewwww! Gross.
Sonia, stop laughing.
You guys can't even
turn on a light bulb.
And the three of you together
can't even fit it in a socket.
Aww, you felt bad.
So sorry.
Hey Rhea, heard you're
doing the Mentos ad.
l hope they're using
you just for radio.
lf you appear on the TV,
it will crash, right?
And l've heard you're doing
an ad for some pest control.
Perfect choice.
Looking at you,
you know, rats,
mosquitoes and cockroaches
will commit suicide.
Whatever.
Hey Jugs, just let it be.
Did you see that? She's smart.
Even though she's
wearing a bracelet from 1942.
That's so old fashioned...
At least, she's not
like you... slutty.
And so says the fatty.
Jugs, let it be.
lt's our last day of Junior College.
Let's go.
See, always the losers.
Ta ta, losers!
Hey, do come to Gollu's party.
He needs someone to cook.
l'll show you the way to the kitchen.
And l'll show you the
way to your graves... *****
Come on.
Let it go...
Ladies, ladies, ladies...
don't finish all the
hot stepping here.
Save some for my party tonight.
Hey Gollu, we were walking
away from your party. Got it?
l love the way you tease me.
But remember, Freddie Kapoor
is playing at my party tonight.
And only short skirts and mini
dresses allowed in my party.
lf l don't see girls high,
then bye bye!
Hey, what's girls high?
Why do you need to know that?
Anyway, you're never
gonna get there. Forget it.
Wassup guys?
Hey Luv, how are you doing?
Great.
All set for the party tonight?
Dude, l'm like super-set.
You were getting your new car, right?
Where is it?
ln the parking lot... right outside.
Oh great, let's go for a ride.
No, no, no.
The first ride is for Rhea.
C'mon man, you and your Rhea.
Hey, you guys know
everything is for her.
What dude...
So l'll see you guys at 10pm?
Yeah man
Alright dude.
So you guys are coming home, right?
Let's get ready there
and head to the party.
What ready? l'm coming like this.
You have a make-up kit, right?
Or l'll get my mom's kit.
Hiiiiieeee.
Hi girls.
Yoohoo.
This is our last chance to escape.
Let's run.
Don't be mean, Jugs.
She's Sonia's mom.
Sorry, Son.
Hey, don't be.
l already am.
Wassup girlfriends?
Congratulations.
Now you're no more girls.
You've become women.
Welcome to the club.
l'm so excited.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Hey, l've come here to boost my BlFFs.
BlFF?
Best Friends Forever.
Sonia, you're so not with it.
We'll have to do something about her.
Mom, it's B-F-F.
Where did you get the 'l' from?
l am your Best
Friend Forever, darling.
So, there's the 'l'
- Right? Right?
Let's go.
Hey, where?
We've met them after such a long time.
That too on your Graduation Day.
Jugs, you haven't tried that
General Motors Diet right?
l can make out.
Look at me.
ln just 15 days.
5 kilos.
All in the right places.
Hey, where's the party tonight?
Where are the cute boys tonight?
Mom?
Aunty, there are no cute boys.
We're going together.
Ouch!
And our curfew is from 11 o'clock.
This curfew stuff is such nonsense.
Mom, mom, mom, let's go.
Hey, where to? Take a chill pill.
Hey, enjoy yourself.
Have a blast.
Have a blast.
l wish l were there with you.
Bye.
Mom.
What mom, mom?
How many times have l told you,
call me Lux.
Now you too get your portfolio done.
These plain types like
Rhea are getting Mentos ads.
And you have my looks, so pretty.
Here comes your Satan Bhagat.
Hey, Rhea.
Hi, Luv.
Hey, Jugs.
C'mon baby, hop in.
Rhea...
your virginity is everything.
Please don't lose it.
Especially not in
the back seat of a car.
Okay 'mom', bye.
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,
l can see you.
You wait now.
F-U-N Fun Funaa.
Come on.
lf you can, Gun Guna.
Dude, l can't believe it.
We're gonna be
watching Freddie Kapoor Live.
l'm so excited.
Well l bet you're not as excited
as sitting in my cool new Jag.
Uh, no l'm not.
Jag? Freddie Kapoor?
You can't even compare the two.
You're mistaken, baby.
Do you know how many cars like
these are there in the world?
How many?
Just 33. That's it.
Baby, she loves you.
Do you know...
Sometimes it feels like you
love your car more than me.
Aww, come on baby.
You know that's not true.
You know l love you more.
Especially when the
car's in the garage.
What an ass.
C'mon babes, chill.
Babes, hey, look, l'm kidding,
l'm kidding.
Come here.
See l got this car because
it's your 18th birthday.
And l wanted it to be special.
But why did you have to do so much?
l mean, you didn't
have to get your car.
You and l watching Freddie
Kapoor would have been great.
Well, if that's enough,
l'll cancel our
reservation at the Thai Jungle.
You booked us in at the Thai Jungle?
But it's so expensive.
Baby, tonight, there's
nothing too expensive for you.
Oh, Luv
l love you baby.
l love you.
Whoa! Babes, not the hair.
Not the hair please.
Not the hair please... relax.
Are you a diva?
Well, what can l say?
Whoa babes, watch out...
Watch out
Stop stop stop
And we're home.
So, pick me up tonight.
l'll see you later, baby.
Bye.
Umm, babes, you remember?
Tonight? Our big celebration?
Dinner? After the party?
lt's just you and me.
Actually Luv,
l'm a little nervous about that.
Nervous?
Babes, why are you nervous?
Babes, you aren't
with some random guy.
You're with me.
Your Luv.
Trust me.
Tonight, when we're together,
you won't feel like this.
lt'll be the most
natural feeling in the world.
Remember, you said that
you wouldn't pressurise me?
l'm not pressurising you, baby.
lt's just that l've always
wanted this night to be special.
And now that you are in my life,
l just can't wait.
But you know what?
lf you don't want to
We don't have to.
C'mon now.
l'm ready.
Babes, there's no pressure.
Not at all?
No, no, no.
Seriously, l'm ready.
And l've never been so sure
about anything in my life.
Okay.
Don't be late, okay?
Pick me up at 9 o'clock, sharp.
l will, l will, l promise.
Don't be late.
Okay.
Hey! Hey!
And here's something l made for you.
Happy Anniversary, baby.
Anniversary?
Yeah! We've
completed 4 months, stupid.
Oh My God. Yes, yes, today.
l'm so sorry, l forgot.
lt's our 4-month anniversary, man.
l know, l know, l just remembered.
l'm so sorry.
C'mon c'mon, let's take
an anniversary picture now.
We're looking good.
Alright.
Bye.
Why am l singing to myself?
Why am l smiling to myself?
What's going to happen tonight?
Although l'm on top of the world
l'm also a little afraid about
What's going to happen tonight?
l've dreamed my whole life
About my first love
Now my dream is finally coming true
ln just a few precious moments
Tonight tonight
ls gonna be our night
And l'll be by your side
Tonight tonight
Everything will be just right
And l'll... be... by... your side
Should l dress up in something
That will make your heart skip a beat
What's going to happen tonight?
Or will you be impressed
lf l come just the way l am
What's going to happen tonight?
lts not like the day
we met for the first time
This time its very special
l'm sure you will not look away
From me for even if its for a moment
Tonight tonight
ls gonna be our night
And l'll be by your side
Tonight tonight
Everything will be just right
And l'll... be... by... your side
Waiting for tonight...
Waiting for tonight...
Rhea, hey Rhea.
Oh mom, wassup?
How was your exam?
Nothing out of the syllabus, right?
lt was okay mom, l'll pass.
Pass? You always get great marks.
And l'm sure you'll get
great marks this year too.
Of course, dad, l will.
Where are you headed
off with these bags?
Sandeep Uncle is in hospital.
He's got chest pains.
We'll have to go to Pune.
Okay, take care.
And be good. And bye.
You're leaving now?
- Yep.
That means you won't be
here on my birthday eve?
Oh, come on, Rhea.
lt's just a matter of one night.
We'll be back tomorrow morning.
Listen, you must take care of
your Granny and Minty, alright?
And no late night
movies for Minty, okay?
You make sure of that.
But, but, mom.
How can l stay home tonight?
Oh God, no, not tonight, please mom.
l told you, it's a big night for me.
lt's Freddie Kapoor's concert tonight.
Rhea, l'm so sorry.
But it's just a matter of one night.
Try and understand.
Caw! Caw! He's trying
to sit on my head again.
Son of a *****
Mom, please, language.
And stop focusing on
the crows, please.
Hey, it's not a crow,
it's your father-in-law.
Huh?
He didn't have the guts to
fight with me while he was alive.
Now, he's taking revenge after dying.
l'm coming!
Mom, you're leaving me
with this crazy granny?
l have a party tonight.
Why don't you do one thing?
lf you can't have a girls night out
Why don't you have a girls' night in?
Why don't you have a pajama party?
lt'll be really cool.
Mom, can't you stay back?
Mom, Rhea can bring her
friends home, why can't l?
Minty, it's Rhea's birthday, right?
But mom, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Minty, shall l check your homework?
Oh damn, who has kept
buckets here in the kitchen?
ls this any way to...
Mom, that's the bathroom.
The kitchen is on this side.
l am so sorry,
but l promise l'll make
this up to you tomorrow.
Alright? Okay.
Okay, chin up, l'll see you
in the morning tomorrow.
You girls, see you, bye.
Be good, alright?
And Minty, don't trouble
your sister Rhea.
Okay mom, bye.
Bye Luv, bye.
Hey, give me a smile.
l'm really sorry Luv,
but Mom and Dad have
screwed up tonight's plan.
Ugh! Why are you kissing
the computer?
Oh my God, Rhea.
lf dad comes to know,
he'll have a heart attack.
That you are going
around with this smuggler,
Mukesh Nanda's son?
He's not a gangster,
he's a politician.
And anyway Minty,
we're just friends, okay?
A guy and a girl can never
be just friends, sis.
Fine Minty, what do you want?
Your Diesel jeans.
Those? Those are my favourite.
And they won't even fit you.
Sis, this is a future investment.
Your generation will
never understand it.
No way, Minty.
No problem,
can you tell me dad's number?
Here, take this.
Do you know you're no less
than a gangster!
Sis, how about that top?
Shut up, and get outta here.
Hey, missing me already?
Luv, something's gone wrong.
What happened?
My parents had to rush to Pune.
And l will have to stay at home
to babysit Granny and Minty.
l can't make it tonight.
C'mon babes, you can come for a while.
l'll pick you up and drop
you home on time, l promise.
l'm sorry, not tonight.
Babes, what do you mean not tonight?
l've made all the
arrangements for tonight.
Dinner, party, Freddie Kapoor.
Babes, l mean you and me,
what about all that?
Tomorrow, l'm all yours,
l just can't come tonight.
l'm really sorry.
Don't be sorry, baby.
Anyway, l don't wanna go to the party.
So, now that you're not going,
l'll chill at home.
Luv, l'll feel worse if you don't go.
Please.
Fine, l'll go. But l'm telling you
l'll go, sit in a corner and
just keep remembering you.
Anyway, we're gonna be
together tomorrow, right?
So cheer up.
l love you.
Bye.
Guys, l must be the only one
sitting at home on my 18th birthday.
So don't sit at home.
Who asked you to?
Tell me something.
l have a plan.
Let's party at home till late.
And when your Granny crashes,
we'll go out and party.
Yuppie, Freddie Kapoor.
There's one problem.
My Granny doesn't sleep.
What?
She's an insomniac... can't sleep.
At night too?
l have an idea.
To party at home,
we'll need to get some
rum and tequila, right?
So we'll have some,
give Granny some, have some,
give her some.
And then,
Granny will be knocked out.
And we'll get out.
Brilliant idea... Yes! Yes!
No, no, not a brilliant idea.
Are you guys crazy or something?
Have you gone mad?
There can't be any rum
or tequila in this house.
l'll be dead.
l'm not gonna touch a single bottle.
Jugs, take this too.
Wow, nice choice, Rhea.
What do you want?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Do we look like we're
less than 21 years old?
You don't even seem
like you're 18 years old.
(Laughs) 17.
Actually, this is not for us.
This is for our Granny.
Sonia, look you've got a double chin.
You've become fat.
Go get yourself a chewing gum
Double chin?
- And do some mouth exercises.
lt's for our Granny.
Really?
Yes.
So, please ask her to come
and fetch it herself.
But she's very sick
and this is her medicine.
She's not just sick,
she's on her death-bed.
And this is her last wish.
We must fulfill her
last wishes, right?
Not everybody's last
wishes are fulfilled, right?
Next!
C'mon.
What do we do now?
Karthik... Karthikeyan Ramachandran.
What's your problem?
You keep stalking us.
What do you want?
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,
come, come, come, come, fast.
- What happened?
Shhh.
Look here.
Fast
lf it were me,
l'd have gone after Rhea too
l'm telling you, man,
Natasha is way hotter.
Really? l wasn't aware of that.
Obviously, Natasha is way hotter.
But Rhea has higher points, right?
Luv has wasted four
months chasing her.
Poor fellow.
l know.
Anyway, he'll get 500 points
with Natasha.
Oh yeah.
Anyway, where is Luv?
With Plan B, Natasha!
At Carter Road.
Actually, l'm not too far behind.
Tonight, with Maya and Tara,
l'm gonna...
Gonna do what?
Get them to make me their brother.
Get them to make me their brother.
But why do you wanna do that, dude?
Gollu.
l told him to go to the party.
He can't go alone, right?
l mean, it's nothing really.
Natasha is just a friend.
Rhea, get real, wake up and
smell the coffee, woman.
Natasha was Plan B.
Don't you understand?
Let's go to Carter's.
Do these fellows have to
come in between right now?
ldiots!
Move it, guys.
Guys, it cannot be.
Luv loves me a lot.
He really...
Oh my God Rhea, that is...
Look, didn't l tell you?
Jugs, you are right.
l won't tolerate this.
l'm gonna go there
and ask him right now.
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea,
hold on, just calm down.
Don't you have any self-respect?
Do you want to create a big scene
in a public place like this?
What scene? l'm gonna
create a climax scene now.
And not the way he wants it.
You come with me.
Guys, guys
- Juggy.
Karthikeyan, you here again?
Rhea is not the only one.
Stay out of it.
Natasha is also not the only one.
What are you saying, Karthikeyan?
This is a very big game.
l'll explain everything.
But you'll have to come with me.
Hi.
Enter Password?
Hey, it's me, Karthik.
Enter Password?
Kiss me baby kiss me
Kiss me baby one more time
Come in.
Guys, my older brother.
Daman
G-l-R-L-S!!!
Hey, the...
BBC.
This is the BBC.
Billionaires Boys' Club.
A super exclusive network
that connects some of
lndia's richest kids.
But what happens on this site?
On this site,
these guys upload
pictures and videos of girls.
You know, er... umm...
those, er... types of...
Stop that, we get it!
No, but these are dares.
Dude, these are all dares.
See, l'll show you.
For cleavage shots,
bra shots of girls, kissing shots
Making out
And if it's with a teacher,
you get extra points.
Points?
Yeah, it's a competition.
See?
Forget Facebook and online games.
This is the new rage.
Of all the rich boys.
The game starts at the
beginning of each year.
And the one who collects the maximum
points becomes the BBC King.
Top dog.
And your friend Luv Nanda is
the highest ranker of the year.
With 9,150 points.
Correct, and of course, he will be.
Look at this, he's making out
with that really hot teacher.
Oh my God.
This is Ms. Naaz.
Yes, yes, yeah, Ms. Naaz.
And the competition is
very close this year.
Look, Goldie Gulati from
Chandigarh HR College.
He's just behind Luv.
Only 100 points away.
Yeah, very close fight.
He could beat Luv and win.
l don't think so.
lt all depends on tonight.
Tonight?
Aren't you and Luv
supposed to be doing it tonight?
See.
Luv has posted here.
He's gonna be winning
all his points tonight.
Yeah, but how will they prove that
they have done something with girls?
Hidden cameras.
See this?
This is a live feed
from Gollu's house.
These guys shoot
everything and upload it.
Look, in fact, something
is being uploaded right now.
God, they're disgusting
lf all this is about points...
What will get the maximum points?
A thousand points.
The big score is for the cutest,
simplest, prettiest and purest girl.
lf all this was a secret,
how did you come to know?
My brother is a freak.
No, l mean, my bro
is a computer freak.
When were you planning to tell me?
When CDs were selling on the streets?
ldiot!
Moron.
This is why...
This is why l wasn't telling you.
Whenever l come to
tell you, you shout at me.
Actually he's right.
That's exactly why he didn't tell us.
lt's because of your anger.
You are responsible.
lt's your fault.
This is not my fault.
This is all your fault, Sonia.
You used to tell her.
Go out with Luv.
Sit in his car.
Who used to say that?
So, you should have stopped her.
You always interfere.
No, no, it's not our thing,
let's not interfere.
lt's her life.
How am l supposed to know that
Luv would turn out like this?
l'm a much better judge of character.
Hear me out sometime.
She ran away.
Chuck it, Rhea.
And anyway, don't waste
your tears on that duffer.
l will get his tears out.
l will make Luv the dude,
completely nude.
Jugs, let it be.
What do you mean, let it be?
You might be cool with it
But l'm not.
Nobody messes around with
my best friend and gets away with it.
For once, l agree with Jugs.
We must do something.
Thank you.
What will you do?
Don't you guys get it?
l loved him.
l thought he was the one for me.
l'm here and he's there with Natasha.
lt's all over.
Everything is finished.
Maybe, there was
something wrong with me.
l know it.
Excuse me, that's my best
friend you're talking about.
l'll break your teeth
if you say anything about her!
Babe, don't you get it,
you are perfect.
She's right, babes.
Girls, girls.
lt has been uploaded.
What?
See it for yourself.
l don't wanna watch. l'm going home.
One thousand points!
Luv
- l love you baby - l love you too
Watch me
- Luv Nanda
Win my 1000 points tonight, yeah!
Luv Nanda
you've broken my heart.
And now, this sweet, simple,...
...girl will break you!
l swear on my psycho Granny
That l am going to have your ****!!
You are not going to
forget my 18th birthday
For as long as you live.
lt's time to put an end to Luv.
Alright girls, listen up.
Luv Nanda is a loser.
Hell, yeah.
And like every womanizer,
there are some things in his life
that make him look like a winner.
Luv Nanda has four Cs.
That makes his life rise
from sea level to this.
And we are going to
take him down, one by one.
And get him to sink.
C number 1?
Car.
Luv's biggest love.
He can bleed, but he can't stand
the sight of a scratch on his car.
C number 2?
Cash.
lt's his dad's money...
His dad's smuggled money.
C number 3?
Charm.
Luv thinks his smooth
talking impresses the girls.
Well, not any more.
Today, we're gonna hurt
him in such places that
girls will never come
near him ever again.
And the final C? His cronies.
l will
- No, we will - Make sure that
all his followers
unfollow him tonight.
And then, all alone
and carless, cashless,
charmless and cronies-less,
Luv Nanda will become Lovely Nanda.
Hey
- Wait a minute.
This was just a plan.
How are we gonna
execute Luv Nanda... er
l mean, how will we execute the plan?
Follow me.
l have had enough
Tell me, tell me
Whatever happened was too much
This love that has happened
Has gone up in smoke

Hey, do you think
we've gone overboard?
No way.
This is just the trailer.
The movie's only just getting started!
See, l told you guys, we did too much.
What if Luv Nanda
doesn't turn up here?
lt would have been too much
if we had run him over with the car.
He'll come.
He needs his 500 points.
Because Luv Nanda
doesn't like to lose.
Umm, Natasha, thanks for
getting your dad's car.
Your phone has rung
five times already.
l think you have a habit of
picking up everything late.
Don't you?
l was just gonna pick it up.
Hey, Dad.
- A 50 lakh rupee car.
You've trashed it?
Have you gone mad?
- But Dad...
Who do you think is
gonna pay for it? Your Dad?
No, you're gonna pay me.
Tomorrow onwards
you're gonna travel by an
auto-rickshaw to college. - But...
Take the bus to college.
- But...
From tomorrow onwards,
you are gonna walk everywhere you go.
- But Dad?
Do you get it?
You. Will. Walk.
l love you too Dad, l love you too.
Your Dad sounded really angry.
All okay?
Of course baby, my Dad loves me a lot.
He wants to buy me another car.
Babes, it's already 10:20 pm.
Duck! Duck!
Jugs, it's not duck, it's...
Okay guys, move on.
What do you want now, Minty?
For the next three years,
all your new outfits are mine.
What? Why?
Because l have to give
Granny a sponge bath now. - Why?
Because Granny has to
get ready for your party.
Mom was saying that
Granny hasn't had a
bath in the last 20 years.
Oh my God!
What happened?
Granny has taken off all her clothes.
Granny, you said sponge bath.
What are you doing inside the tub?
Hey, l've been waiting
here for the last 10 minutes.
Don't look at me like that.
Come give me a scrub.
Sis?
- Okay Minty, what do you want now?
First, you get back.
Then we'll negotiate.
But for starters, all your pocket
money for the rest of the year...
Just one month's
pocket money. That's it.
Hello, you're not street shopping.
No bargaining!
Fine Minty, deal!
You brat! Bye!
Granny, how many years has it been...
...since you had your last bath?
Thank you.
Baby, l'm so sorry l was late.
Let's forget this
confusion about the car.
Let's try and enjoy ourselves.
Please.
Good. See?
l got this just for you.
Baked it myself.
So you can cook?
No, l don't know how to cook.
But for you baby,
everything just comes from here.
Ahh... Yes.
Luv?
L-U-V?
Oh, no, no, babes.
Tonight is very special for us.
Let's forget
everything and start afresh.
What do you say?
Hi.
Reservations?
Can we just sit at the bar, please?
Sorry darling, no reservations,
no entry.
Just want to sit at the bar.
That's it.
Look at yourselves.
The way you're dressed,
Forget the bar.
You won't even be allowed
to stand outside the gate.
So... excuse me.
Susanne Ramani and group?
No, Malini Tiwari Group.

But she shouldn't come to know.

Please take this cold water.
Everything will be chilled.
That feels good... that feels good.
Drink for the gentleman.
Oh my God!
She's eating the cupcake.

Gollu?
Dude, you should work out more often.
Look, you're out of shape.
This isn't called being out of shape,
This is called being round shaped.
But... Let it go.
You won't get it.
By the way, why were we following Luv?
l was only running after the girls
who are gonna come to my party.
Anyway, Natasha has found her car.
The girls will come. C'mon.
Timmy?
Wait, wait.
Natasha?

Nice body, Timmy looking ripped.
So what?
Can't two dudes just be friends?
Look at this.
Look at his Facebook page.
Luv is gay?
No, man. This can't be.
Luv doesn't like ladies?
He likes Lady boys?
No, man.
What about the BBC?
Miss Naaz? Rhea?
lt's a cover-up, bro.
Obviously, he can't
tell the world he's gay.
Look at this. Look at his tattoo.
Will you be my gay buddy?
Oh God!
Man, Luv is gay.
But, why is he
sending you these messages?
What do you mean?
l should have known.
When he included the dumbest
guy in college in his group.
Hey, listen, l'm not dumb.
And if it's such a problem,
l quit the group.
K-W-l-T Quit.
Hey, buddy, Timmy,
l was just joking, man.
You know me, man.
l was not serious.
C'mon, don't be like a
drama queen.
Don't take so much footage.
- No, no, l'm dumb, right?
That's why people make fun of me.
Timmy, l was kidding.
There must be
something you are good at.
You're so talented.
There must be
something you are good at.

Hey, excellent.
Dude, this is excellent.
You're so talented.

Anyway, what are we doing here?
lt's my house, my party
and we're in the gutter.
The girls are waiting for us, dude.
C'mon, let's go.
l don't think l'll come.
Why?
l might just beat him up.
Hey, don't be crazy.
Don't touch him by mistake.
They get turned on by all this.
Dude, let's go.
The girls are waiting for us.
Let's party.
Yay! Now we have crossed
out 'C' for Cronies too!
Rhea, my hair is all messy.
My dear Paris Hilton,
Can life get any worse than this?
So you were saying, it
can't get any worse.
Look at this, it has gotten worse.
l shouldn't have joined
you guys in this plan.
lf you can't think with
your own head blame your Mom.
You've got your brains
from her. Don't blame us.
Hey, don't drag my Mom into this.
No matter what she's like,
at least she's not crass like you.
Oh my God, Barbie
just found her voice.
Now, she's never gonna shut up.
She's gonna go, Hey girlfriends
Hey girlfriends like her Mum.
You are just jealous,
Because l'm thin and you're not.
l may be jealous,
l may be fat, l may be crass,
but l'm also a very
good fighter, dammit.
Guys, guys, just stop it, man.
What are you doing?
Hit her, slap her.
Let her go.
You think l'm gonna just
sit here and listen to you?
Stop it, guys.
Mom's calling.
Shit!
Hello? Hello?
You *bitches*, it's that
girl's mother calling.
Shut up now.
When will this Mom
of your's stop abusing
in front of the children?
That's Mum.
By the way, why did you call?
lt's 12 o'clock, sweetie.
Happy Birthday.
Thanks, Mom.
So how's your girls'
night in coming along?
What gifts did the girls get you?
Gifts?
No, mom, l didn't get any gifts.
Jugs and Sonia just promised
they wouldn't fight tonight,
That's their gift.
Those two girls are so predictable.
Baby, l'm so sorry we aren't
there with you at this moment.
But tell you what,
you'll get your gift tomorrow.
Alright?
- And it's a real big one.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling.

For the three of you.
But a police station
for crying out loud?
Have you lost it?
Just shut up and get back home.
Give me the keys.
Where is the car? Give me the keys.
Which part of Where is the car?
Give me the keys
do you not understand, Sonia?
Oh thank God, thank God, thank God.
Some of these clothes
cost more than the car, man.
Now tell me.
What happened?
l'll tell you.
Good you tell me.
So it's a boy story.
l know love is hard, baby.
l know it.
lt's not like a Hindi film.
And l'm so glad you
didn't lock yourself up
in a room and cry like a loser.
You gave the guy right back.
So what if your heart broke,
At least you knew it
was beating right?
But Aunty, she was not alone.
We helped her a lot.
l know, we girlfriends are so cool.
Girl power.
lf my college girlfriends were with me
l would have definitely
burnt Sonia's Dad's yacht.
Mom, you have already done that.
LUV?
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't take the call.
Don't answer.
No, no, no, no, no, no

Rhea, don't answer.
Luv?
Happy Birthday, baby.
Thanks.

Babes, l love you.
And you have no idea
what's happened to me tonight.
l really wish l could

By the way Luv, my
parents are back home.
l can meet you now if you want.
Are you serious?
Babes, that's such good news.
So when do you want to meet?
Where do you want to meet?
Do you want me to come pick you up?
Let's meet at Gollu's party.
Perfect, perfect.
Perfect!
What the hell were you saying?
- Hello?
l can't believe that
after everything he has done.
He still wants to meet me.
He has the balls to call me, man.
He's so desperate for
his 1,000 bloody points.
What if it's a trap?
He has no idea we did anything.
He doesn't know about anything we did.
Looks like what
we did wasn't good enough.
We must finish what we started.
And finish it well.
Why did you tell him that
you could make it to the party?
Jugs, because there's one more
C left in my list - Which one?
Luv Nanda himself and
that damn BBC club of his.
But how will you do this?
Okay.
We'll have to go to
Gollu's party first.
There l'll meet Luv and pretend
like everything is normal.
l'll take him to the camera room.
Right then, you get Karthikeyan
so that he can put that live
footage on the college website.
When all this is done, just
come back and knock on the door.
But, what will you do?
Oh Jugs, you don't wanna know.
Yoohoo.
Hey, when is me being
a designer Mom gonna
help the three of you?
l'll style you in such a way that
he'll regret letting go of
such a hot thing like you.
You get it?
Girl power.
Girl power.
Huh!
Girls are so stupid.
lf a guy had done all this,
he would have never
left his bracelet with me.
Stupid.
Rhea, you messed with the wrong guy.
Rhea is just a Plain Jane.
Never thought she'd get so psycho!
l mean, l just don't get it.
Why would she do this to you?
She's jealous, babes.
l dumped her and picked you over her.
But don't worry about it.
We'll celebrate her 18th birthday now.
Freddie Kapoor's playing tonight.
What do you expect is gonna happen?
The end of Luv.
Karthikeyan
What are you doing here?
Granny's run away from home.
You have to help me find her.
Please come. Please.
- l have to be at the party.
l need to help Rhea.
Okay, l'll tell
everyone that you like Jugs.
Can you spot her?
No.
What? Are you crazy?
But Natasha had promised.
Brother,
How could you even think like this?
You just called me brother?
Let's get outta here...
You called me the B-word?
Maya, Tara, Maya, Tara.
Look it's Luv Nanda...
Hey, look, Luv is here.
- Hey, show me your tattoo.
Hi, Luv.
Hey, Happy Birthday, baby.
l'm so thrilled that
you made it tonight.
l missed you.
l missed you too.
ls everything okay?
What happened?
Well
l had a rough night.
And, actually, you know what?
l need to talk to you.
Okay
but isn't it a little noisy in here?
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
Why not?
C'mon.
Let's go upstairs.
Quick, call Karthikeyan.
Right now.
Quick.
Hello?
- Where are you?
Rhea's Granny has run away from home.
What?
No, no, we found her now.
C'mon Granny, no.
Do you have your laptop on you or not?
Of course, l always
have my laptop with me.
Then get here to Gollu's party.
l can't come.
Minty and Granny are with me.
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,
l don't care about anything.
Rhea has entered the room.
And we have to broadcast her
live footage on these LCDS here.
NOW,
Moron.
l'm so sorry for being late, baby.
But now
l wanna celebrate my birthday
just like it's supposed to be.
You're so hot,
And sexy.
Today, l'm gonna do stuff to you
That you'll never look
at any other girl every again.
What?
l mean, you're just mine, right?
Why would you look at anyone else?
Tonight is going to be the
best night of your life.
Lie back.
Hey moron, stop hogging the road!
How about l tie you up?
And kiss you all over?
Ssh...
No
l'm gonna do the tying.
What did you think?
You'd do all that you did
and l wouldn't find out?
Rhea, people die to be with me.
And this,
This is how you repay me?
Ouch, my nail.
Gollu, catch it on the website.
No live audience please.
Jugs, we need to help her. Right now.
She's in trouble
- Sonia
Breathe,
Okay?
Now run.
My mom was always right.
Every girl wants to trap you.
Because l have everything.
The looks,
The money,
The charm,
The sex appeal,
But don't worry, Rhea,
l'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh no,
l've got more class than that.
What l'm gonna do with you
ls gonna be much much MUCH worse.
Screw you
Aww, my pleasure, baby.
What did you think Rhea?
That l won't win.
lf you do all this,
Rhea, you are the
grand prize of this game.
A sweet virgin,
And when it gets
uploaded on our website,
And l'm gonna get 1,000 points,
And l'm gonna be this years'
Billionaire Boys' Club King.
Karthikeyan
l'm Luv Nanda,
And l never lose.
Luv, you always were and you
always will be a pathetic loser.
You know Rhea, Natasha was my Plan B.
But you almost messed that up too.
Plan B?
l'm nobody's Plan B, you loser.
l'm always Plan A.
Luv is so insensitive?
But Natasha, you will
always be my Plan A.
Don't you touch me, Luv.
l touched you,
l touched you, l touched you.
What are you gonna do?
She needs our help. Let's go.
To start with, l'm gonna get
my 1,000 points.
And then, l'm gonna
do what you did to me.
Your hair...
your clothes won't remain on you.
And your reputation?
Your life, as you know
it is going to be over.
Gollu, l told you later.
We know what's exactly
happening in there, Luv.
Open the door.
Rhea are you ok?
Jugs, we need to call the police.
Right now. Let's go.
Has anyone ever done
this to you, Luv Nanda?
Rhea, Rhea, my eyes.
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.
What do you think?
You're gonna break my heart again?
That l'm gonna be scared?
That l'll go home right away?
Oh my eyes...
You know you are not
that important to me.
Do you know what's my biggest revenge?
That l'll forget you forever
after what happens tonight.
You bloody creep.
But you will remember me forever.
And you will realize
the consequences of
playing with a girl's trust
and her heart.
Just because we don't have them
doesn't mean we don't
know how to kick them.
Billionaires Boys' Club,
you are officially shut down.
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.
Where's Luv?
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.
Can you tell us what happened inside?
He's the real hero.
Speak to him.
Yes, yes, please tell
us what happened inside.
Rhea Dialdas, you were always
uncool and you will always be.
But what you did up
there was quite cool.
Just don't ever mess
with my car or me.
Then even God won't
be able to help you.
Take care girls, have fun.

Always plays the party pooper.
This is fine, but
