(door creaks open)
I've got to go home.
Man: No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
I'm going.
Man: Why?
'Cause I don't want
to be here right now.
Man: Why not?
I love this place.
Come here.
No.
I'm going home.
I want to wake up in my own bed.
Come here for a second.
No.
I'm going home,
really, I am.
Take this off.
- No.
- Yes.
You're stronger than me.
Let me go.
I'm going home.
Suit yourself.
What?
You're not here with me.
You're thinking
about something.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Okay.
It's all right.
- Man: Why do you hold me so tight?
- (woman laughs)
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.
So I can stop saying,
"Don't be sorry."
What time is it?
It's late.
Come here.
Do you ever think about me?
Never.
Good.
Poet:
To begin at the beginning.
Hush.
The babies are sleeping.
The farmers, the fishers,
the tradesmen, and pensioners...
...the undertaker,
and the fancy woman,
drunkard, dressmaker,
preacher, policeman,
the web-foot cockle women
and their tidy wives.
Young girls lie bedded soft,
but glide in their dreams,
with rings and trousseau,
bridesmaided by glow-worms
down the aisles
of the organ-playing wood.
The boys are dreaming wicked...
and the cats nap
in the slant corners
or lope sly,
streaking and needling,
on the one cloud of the roofs.
You can hear the dew falling,
and a hushed town, breathing.
Only your eyes are unclosed.
And you alone can hear
the invisible starfall.
The darkest-before-dawn
minutely dewgrazed stir
of the black, dab-filled sea.
...the Arethusa, the Curlew,
and the Skylark,
Zanzibar, Rhiannon,
the Rover, the Cormorant,
the Star of Wales...
tilt and ride.
Listen...
...the dew falling,
...starfall... sleep of birds,
...milk wood.
This hallway's closed
for the next half hour.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
We'll be out of here
in a half hour.
But I need to get to my apartment
and it's down there.
- Right.
- Hey.
I need to use
that bathroom.
Use the third floor, please.
The bathroom's right there.
And I paid for that.
And I'm telling you
to use the third floor.
Okay.
Don't make
a federal case about it.
Poet: Listen. Look...
dumbly, royally
winding through the
Coronation of cherry trees;
going through
the graveyard of Bethesda
with winds gloved and folded,
and dew doffed;
tumbling by the Sailors Arms.
New York,
New York, New York!!
Neeeew Yoork!
Fucking city! Yes!
Whoa!
(laughing)
How long have we been up?
Uhh... oh Christ,
You gotta figure
we've been on the road
since uh... yesterday,
and it's already today, so...
Poet: Time passes.
Listen...
Time passes.
Come closer now.
Only you can hear the houses
sleeping in the streets
in the slow deep salt
and silent black,
bandaged night.
Only you can see it,
in the blinded bedrooms,
the combs and petticoats
over the chairs,
the jugs and basins,
the glasses of teeth.
Thou Shalt Not on the wall.
Endurance.
Man: Responsibility
is a necessity for happiness.
Poet: and the yellowing
dickybird-watching
pictures of the dead.
Poet: cat's purr in the kitchen.
It smells like shit.
Is it an overdose
or a suicide?
An overdose is suicide.
I'm a man, Greta.
One of the last goddamn men.
Unfortunately,
there's only three of us left.
Unfortunately,
we're all drunks.
And that ain't nothing new.
Nothing new.
You're born in this world
and they shove it down your throat.
Poet:
Only you can hear and see,
behind the eyes
of the sleepers,
the movements and countries
and colors
and rainbows and...
First, I want to go
to 42nd Street.
Then, I want to go
to Harlem.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, there we are.
I feel fucking sick.
Poet: and flight and fall
and despairs and big seas...
Driver: Do you know
where we're going?
- I think so.
- All right.
I gave everyone 100%.
Whatever they take away
is their business.
(knocking on door)
- Who is it?
- Man: Thank God! Listen.
I lost my key to the bathroom.
Can I use your key?
- Please...
- I'm sleeping.
- I'm sorry...
- I don't have the key.
(knocks again)
Please!
Hello? Hello?!
Hi.
No. Go away.
(knocks again)
Leave me alone.
Another man: Audrey?
Val?
Val?
- Goddamn slob.
- Talk about beautiful.
I'll tell you about beautiful.
This place used to be beautiful.
Everybody lived here.
Everybody who was anybody.
It's fucking disgusting.
There's vomit everywhere.
Audrey:
I missed you.
I didn't think
you were coming back.
Where have you been?
Are you gonna stay?
Cop #1:
Look at this...
songs.
There's tons of them.
Psst.
Pills for epilepsy.
Nyquil bottles, empty...
all empty.
Cop #2: This guy must have had
some sore throat.
You don't believe me,
but I'm telling you,
40 years ago this place
was beautiful.
It still is from the outside.
Some frog from New Orleans
built it for artist types.
Supposed to be a hotel
for artists.
Cop #1: Artists...
shit.
Hotel for drug addicts.
(woman yelling)
(woman still yelling)
(woman screaming)
There was a fire here last week
and nobody told me.
I go to the store
to get a pack of cigarettes,
and there are all these people
in the lobby.
I asked them why and they said
because there was a fire.
And no one told me!
I'm staying this time.

My stove is still leaking.

Why don't you fix my stove...
and then you'll get
your painting?

Yes.
I don't feel

Yes.
Okay.
You try painting and then...
you give me advice, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you hang on one second?
Man: 10 years ago
I was living in San Diego
off and on.
Spent a lot of time
in Carmel and Big Sur.
I ran naked and fasted.
I found the lightness
of existence.
I freed myself from
all of society's burdens.
I let the spirits
pass through me.
I let the spirits talk to me,
all that shit.
I was into candles, and incense
and the death of JFK,
and Martin Luther King,
and Bobby and Malcolm X.
This is where I'm coming from.
It may or may not be important.
Val: For Christ's sake, man.
Look at you.
I got $2,000 out of it.
What happened to your dog?
Rock, you mean.
Died.
What happened was...
I was working for my uncle
in my uncle's shop.
- Uncle Vern.
- Shit.
You're not there,
and everyone hates me.
I'm doing a lot of drugs,
I'm under the gun.
I found out you were here,
and me and Rock
got on the train, and...
(stuttering)
fell on me.
Or I fell off of it.
I don't remember.
I came to The Chelsea
to help a friend.
A friend who was beyond help.
And I never left.
If it wasn't for this place,
I wouldn't live in New York.
For the first year
I rarely left my room.
I had spent years, man.
Years living with the vibe!
How's the wife doing?
Cute...
socialite, Brandy Alexander?
Does she wear lace for you?
Is it like a French movie?
It's okay.
I love her.
You're a weak man.
Yeah, well...
You should come back with me.
You're miserable.
- Where are you going?
- Going to Mexico.
Getting lost in Mexico,
under the gun.
But I am.
Guess what? You are too,
only you don't admit it,
you've weakened for lacy,
soft pleasures.
...And they found me.
I wasn't looking.
I wasn't asking.
It wasn't God,
it wasn't Buddha.
It was a conversation.
I had a fucking conversation...
with Dylan Thomas.
Well...
I think about leaving
all the time.
I love her,
you don't understand that.
You're right.
I'm probably the devil.
You came here to hear this.
You've heard his sounds,
you've felt his feelings,
this is sacred.
We've all got
to come together...
and realize...
that ghosts
are our most valuable resource.
We need them as much
as they need us.
They stay here at The Chelsea
because this is the only place
people listen to them.
Their blood is on the walls.
Hey, are you Bob?
Hey, are you Bob Dylan?
By any chance
can I kiss your boot?
Fuck off.
You're from Minnesota, aren't you?
You must be him.
Seriously, fuck off.
Bob! Bob! Bob!
Listen, you're not
gonna believe this.
I'm down in the lobby, right?
Yeah?
There's this guy
putting up a painting,
so I'm helping him
with the ladder.
He tells me he lives here
in a room just like this one,
but he's got it all
for free.
All he's gotta do is give
a painting to the manager.
This guy's...
bullshitting me about
how he's an artist,
and the manager understands,
and as long as he's creating,
he can live here.
- The guy was lying.
- That's what I thought,
but...
the manager was standing
fucking right there.
What did it look like?
- What?
- The painting, dumbshit.
That's the best part.
It's ugly as shit.
I could have done it, easy.
A whole bunch of colors
thrown all around.
I don't know.
I don't know...
This place fucking kills me.
(hissing)
Fuck.

this is sticky.
Do you have a sponge?
I do.
Here.

I hated school.
I never wanted to go.
I wanted to drop out, even.
Why didn't you?
A teacher...
he drove a motorcycle.
Who did?
The teacher,
not me.
Where's your garbage?
Um... here.
Just...

Sink.
I have this reoccurring dream.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm a in cold water flat
in the East Village...
and it's cold...
and bare-bones empty,
I mean nothing.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And that dream
reminds me of you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
It's kind of sad.
I'm all alone in the dream.
It's kind of sad.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I should go.

Sure.

- Come on in.
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.
If you pay me enough,
I'll answer your questions.
Not that kind.
Just simple questions.
- Like what?
- What does O.T.B. mean to you?
Off Track Betting.
Nice.

It doesn't take a genius.

There's an O.T.B. next door.

Hi, Audrey.
Hi.
You sure are looking...
(door slams)
Sure are looking pretty today.
You should be real happy.
You fucked up everything for me.
You fucked up things for me
a long time ago.
I'm not going with you,
even if she kicks me out.
She'll kick you out.
Eventually.
Sayonara.
Hey, lilac-lily-girl.
It's all safe.
$43.
What?
That's all we got.
So?
"So?"
We're starving here.
Yeah...
Maybe I should go.
Oh, I see.
- No, you don't.
- I think I do.
It's hard to see you
live like this.
Like what?
We're just living.
A lot of people
live like this.
- Starving?
- Yeah, and worse.
The real question is...
What?
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie.
Okay.
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?
No way.
Come here.
Audrey's voice:
Oh, may it come,
the time of love,
the time we'd be enamored of.
I've been patient too long,
my memory is dead,
all fears and all wrongs
to the heavens have fled,
while all my veins burst
with a sickly thirst.
Together: Oh, may it come,
the time of love...
Val's voice:
...the time we'd be enamored of.
Audrey's voice:
Oh, may it come,
the time of love,
the time we'd be enamored of.

You want an aspirin?
I'm gonna have one myself.
No, maybe later.
- I'll get it.
- No, no.
You know what I've been
thinking about lately?
No. What?
What have you
been thinking about?
About how my father used to put
gasoline behind his ear,
like perfume,
so when he held a girl close
at a dance,
she'd know he had a car.
Yeah?
That's what I was thinking about
as you were walking up the stairs.
Lately?
Here, sit down.
It's easier for me to stand,
but you shouldn't have to.
Uh-huh.
What?
Hello.
Nothing, nothing.
I'm on to you,
you know?
There's a word in German.
- Which one?
- One word.
It means...
a near paralyzing fear
of not being able
to connect.
In America we call it fear.
One word.
You know what I'm talking about.
Instead of talking about
that bottle of whiskey...
Yes, yes.
I'm not drinking it.
My glass is just for water.
You got the whole bottle for me,
myself, alone?
Yeah. I figured it was either that,
or a philosophy lesson.
I don't want a lesson.
I'm in no shape for it.
No lessons.
All right.
Well?
Are you gonna stand?
Are you gonna sit?
Want me to stand?
No.
I'll sit down with you.
Here's to those fields
that I won time.
Oh, no.
To cowardice.
No.
To "no."
No.
This is a good way
to get sober.
We'll disagree
on what to drink to.
Here's to everyone...
thinking that they know
everything,
when they don't know
anything at all.
What are you talking about...
really?
Jealousy and what
a horrible trait it is.
But you don't possess it?
No, I have my own set
of qualities
that aren't so admirable.
Let's drink to those.
Maybe.
- What are they?
- You know them.
- I don't.
- You do!
The big one is impatience.
- That doesn't bother me.
- It's a horrible fault.
Huge fault.
You want to drink
to your impatience?
Yes, and...
to cowardice.
All right.
All right.
I got off easy.
I have a lot worse qualities.
No, you don't,
cowardice is the worst,
especially in a man.
Wow.
I did something bad
the other day.
You didn't take a drink.
I told you I'm not drinking.
So what's the bad thing
you did?
It's nothing.
All right,
you'll tell me about it later,
and I'll make sure to tell you
everything is all right.
And you'll feel much better.
- I feel better already.
- Yeah.
You know what
would be better even?
- What?
- Better than a drink?
What?
If you rubbed my back.
Okay.
Oh God,
why am I here?
I don't want to be here.
We could help each other.
I want to believe that,
but I don't.
You told me a long time ago
that I didn't have any faith.
You were right.
I finally realized
what you meant by that.
I didn't mean that.
It's true.
You can look at me in the eyes
and tell me you don't have faith?
If I could look at you
in the eyes?
Yes.
I...
Yes.
It just seems...
so impossible.
- What seems impossible?
- You!
Do I make you feel safe?
I feel...
I feel safe,
but I'm not.
Why not?
Because when I look at you,
I can't get out.
I get lost.
- Completely?
- You know.
You can have me completely.
- No. No.
- You know that, right?
You're wrong.
We could help each other.
I want to believe that...
but I don't.
It's the truth,
whether you believe it or not.
You're no good to yourself
and you hide it from me.
Why can't you understand that
when you hurt yourself
you might as well hurt me?
If you...
just turn it around,
I mean...
you'd have no patience for me
if I destroyed myself.
How would you feel?
Would you feel loved?
Would you feel like
you had me completely?
You do hurt yourself.
How?
By being with me.
You came to save me,
didn't you?
Of course I did.
At least I haven't had
a drink in years.
Yeah, sure.
At least
I don't need it tonight.
Well, I might.
Nah, you don't.
Yes.
Come here.
Poet:
Dusk and ceremonial dust.
and night's first darkening snow,
and sleep of birds
drift under and through
the live dusk of
this place of love.

Poet:
When I was a windy boy and a bit
and the black spit
of the chapel fold,
Sighed the old ramrod,
dying of women,
I tiptoed shy
through the gooseberry wood
The rude owl cried
like a tell-tale tit,
and I skipped blushing
as the big girls
rolled ninepins
down on the donkeys' common.
And on the seesaw Sunday nights,
I wooed whoever I would
with my wicked eye.
The whole of the moon
I could love and leave
all the green leaved
little weddings' wives
in the coal black bush
and let them grieve.
MC: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
(applause)
You're too kind.
You're too kind.
You're too beautiful
and you're too kind.
Not only are you beautiful
on the outside,
let's face it,
you are,
buy you're also beautiful
on the inside.
Let's hear it for the waitress.
Drop another glass.
Each one of you,
every one of you...
you got a mind.
You know what they say?
"A mind is a terrible thing
to waste."
Which leads me to mind reduction.
I'm the dream man,
the dream maker,
the vision keeper,
your memory.
All the world's nostalgia,
your dictionary,
your encyclopedia.
Welcome. Hey!
We've got a great show.
Sit back, relax...
and go to sleep if you want to.
Just kidding.
What I'm about to do
for you tonight,
and this is a warning
of sorts,
I'm gonna be with you.
It's sort of a spell
I cast on people.
I don't mean to do it,
but I do.
Let's say,
for example...
I'm your subconscious,
and you...
you're my jailer.
I do something wrong,
you hold the key.
I don't even know you,
but in the dark of the night
our eyes meet.
And then, my friend,
I'm through.
She...
There's always a "she"...
And she is known as...
"the one who got away."
Bring it down, boys.
About 4:00 a.m. the other night
I finished my vodka,
the bottle, that is.
In other words,
I'm referring to,
the bottle that I finished.
Liquor stores are closed,
so I'm contemplating a tatoo...
"The one who got away."
Then I remembered
what a religious guy I am,
and how our maker
didn't intend for tatoos,
with us being made
in His vision, and all that.
Hey, that's good enough for me.
So I'm without a tatoo.
I don't have a drink.
And I don't have her.
Time has a funny way...
of finding us
in the strangest places.
Terry?
Hey, Terr.
Hey, Terry.
- Listen.
- Jesus, Ross.
Where the fuck
have you been?
We have
some nice guests here.
You should be hospitable.
They're mine, okay?
Hey, this is...
my good friend Terry.
He came out here with me.
Terry, I'd like you
to meet...
Lorna Doone.
Um-huh.
- What's your name?
- Wall.
Yeah, Wall!
Wall and...
this is all of us.
It's very nice
to meet everybody.
Yeah.
They sure know how to breed them
out there with them cows.
Yeah.
Men are so ugly in New York.
I know.
Wall: Got any more of these?
Ross: You got an ID?
Terry: Just give it to him.
What the hell?
The man wants a beer.
I'm gonna go to sleep again.
Ross: I'm first.
Here.
I got something for you.
Get over here.
Ross:
Come over to the quiet part.
Come over to the quiet part.
Don't bother him.
He's quiet.
Hey.
Are you gonna sleep
with your clothes on?
Yes.
It's a game of rhythm.
It's called Thumper.
Don't you want to get
under the covers?
No.
Can I tuck you in?
Um...
No.
It's okay.
Tired boy, huh?
Hi.
Why do they call you Lorna Doone?
Ain't that a cookie?
You can call me
whatever you want.
Do you want me
to sleep with you?
Huh?
No.
Are you sure about that?
Hey.

that I'm in a real...
predicament.
And it's real deep too.
Because I'm not a kid anymore.
And I'm not broke anymore.
Why didn't you stop me?
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I don't want to open it.
I may never open it.
Greta, answer me honestly.
have you ever sat down
to have a drink
and it falls down you
like a waterfall of fire?
Like it splits you
down the middle,
like it burns a hole
in your brain
and drains the blood out of your heart
and onto the floor.
What do I like?
You want a list?
Okay, okay.
I like booze.
I like you.
I like...
little girls older than four
and younger than six.
Little girls like that,
they should open presents.
I'm a grown man
for Christ's sake.
I've uh...
come up with something.
And uh...
well,
I think...
I just need...
unconditional love.
Are you there?
Oh.
Well, what do you think?
About that.
I was in the elevator
on the way up here,
and there was a little girl
with her mother in there with her.
The little girl had
these huge brown eyes,
curls all over her head,
and she beamed at me
and then hugged my leg.
I just looked at her, you know,
and smiled, grinned really.
No teeth.
Teeth scare kids I think.

§ To catch your eye §

§ That you were tryin' to hide §
And it was so strange,
as I got out,
her mother said,
"She's gonna fall in love
with men who look like you
and not know why.
But I will."
And then the elevator door closed.
It was...
oddly...
beautiful.

Bud's voice:
And I've had a couple of drinks
so it's all dreamy, but...
I couldn't help wondering
about you as a little girl
in an elevator
with your mother.
I wonder...
I wonder if you ever
saw a man
like me.
I'm tired, baby.
Goodnight.
What do you know
about human frailty?
Enough, Buster!
- What's that?
- A wall.
A beer wall.
Girl: It's nice.
I know.
So what do you do?
Are you a gambler
like your friend?
No. He's not a gambler either.
I want to be a Pinkerton.
Is that what your dad does?
No. He's a professional.
Both: Professional what?
A professional, is all.
Why do you want to be a spy?
I want to be
a private detective.
Wall: I'm going to be
very mysterious.
And invincible.
And nobody
will know who I am.
I've got a code name
and I'm going to get cards.
They're going
to ask for "Wallman."
That's me,
'cause well,
I'll just melt into walls.
Like a human wall.
A human bug,
a human tape recorder,
a human tap on phones.
Everybody is going to love me.
I've got to learn
how to go days without sleeping.
Can't eat neither.
Wallman's got to be real skinny.
My business cards will say,
"For the Wallman...
I'll find you."
Jesus.
Audrey's voice:
I want to be a lost poem
in a stranger's coat pocket,
(shower running)
that conveys the importance of you.
To assure you of my desire,
to assure you of dreams.
I want all the possibilities
of you in writing.
I want to give you
your reflection,
Both:
I want your eyes on me,
I want to travel to the lightness
with you and stay there,
and I want
everything before you...
...everything before you
to follow us like a trail behind me.
I want never
to say goodbye to you,
even on the street corner
or the phone.
I want,
I want so much
I'm breathless.
I want to put my power
into a poem to burn a hole
in your pocket
so I can sew it.
Val: I want my words
to scream through you
Audrey: I want the poem
not to mean that much.
Both: And I want
to contradict myself by accident,
Audrey: and for you
to know what I mean.
I want you to be distant
and for me to feel you close,
I want endless days
when it's day and...
nighttime never to end
when it's night.
I want all the seasons
in one day.
I want the sun to set before us
and come up in front of us.
I want water up to our waists
and to be drenched by the rain,
up to our ankles
with holes in our shoes.
...with holes in our shoes.
Both: I want to think your thoughts
because they're mine.
I want only
what's urgent with you.
I want to get
in the way of the barriers
and I want you to be a tough guy
when you're supposed to,
like you do already.
...when you're supposed to.
And I want you to be tender,
like you do already.
And I want us
to have met for a reason
and I want that reason
to be important.
And I want it
to be bigger than us,
I want it to take over us.
I want to forget.
I want to remember us.
And when you say
you love me
I don't want to think
you really mean New York City,
and all the fun
we have in it.
And I want your smile always,
and your grimaces too.
I want your scar on my lips,
and I want your disappointments
in my heart.
I want your strength
in my soul
and I want
your soul in my eyes,
I want to believe
everything you say,
and I do.
And I want you
to tell me what's best
when I don't know.
And when you're lost
I want to find you.
And when you're weary
I want to give you steeples
and cathedral thoughts
and coliseum dreams.
I want to drag you from the darkness
and kneel with you
exhausted with the blinding light
blaring on us,
And...
Ross: So...
I met Terry's brother first
at treatment.
And then I went
to a halfway house
and I ended up
in a storefront downtown.
So Terry comes in,
I don't even know
how Terry knew I was there,
I didn't even know Terry.
But everybody knew Terry Olsen,
Girl: Hmm...
- Really?
- He, uh...
(girl chuckles)
So...
- Terry came in to my place,
- Uh-huh?
and he says,
"Hey..."
No. He said,
"Get your shit... get your shit together.
Why are you... why are you
wasting your life away?"
And you know what?
(water dripping)
He was right.
Hmm...

(guitar music plays)
§ They were strolling
in the gloaming §
- § Where the roses were in bloom §
- (knocking on door)
- § A soldier and his sweetheart §
- Bud: Grace!
§ Brave and true... §
Oh, man!
Wait a second!
Uh...
Hey, it's late.
Grace:
What's the matter?!
(door closes)
Bud: I'm very, very,
very, very, very...
very, very,
very, very drunk.
May I come in?
Grace: What's this?
I stole it for you.
Grace: You stole it?
Uh-huh.
It's not as
old-fashioned as flowers.
- (groaning)
- Can I come in?
Actually I was just about
to go to bed, so...
Just for a second.
Can I get you something?
- May I use the...
- Sure.
(door closes)
Bud: Grace?
Yes?
You must promise me something.
- Okay.
- Don't be scared of me.
I'm not a scary drunk.
I'm not even a mean drunk.
(toilet flushing)
Actually, they say it's a sickness,
so it's...
not even my fault.
- Just friends.
- Sure.
What?
"Just friends," that song.
Chet Baker.
Yeah?
I heard you play that song.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I came over because
I have no friends
and I need a friend and...
you like that song...
you told me.
Maybe you should just go home
and get some sleep, though.
I'm sure you'll feel much better
in the morning.
Do you have any aspirin?
Aspirin? Uhm...
I don't think I do.
I hate going to bed drunk.
I get scared I won't wake up.
Maybe you should go
and get some coffee then.
Coffee is a fallacy.
It makes you sober because
that's what you've been told,
it's psychological.
The only way to get sober
is to sweat it out,
stay up.
Well, uh...
I'd love to sweat it out
with you, but...
I really, really
got to get some sleep.
Sing to me.
Sing to you?
I'm...
I'm just not a singer.
What's it going to take, Grace?
What do you mean?
I mean...
who do you want me to be?
Oh, I think you're fine, Bud.
You're just a little drunk.
(Bud chuckles)
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever been drunk?
Me?
Of course.
Have you ever been drunk?
Honey, you just asked me that.
I mean,
have you ever been in love?
It's none of your business.
Of course I have.
Well,
let me tell you something.
I know exactly
what I'm saying,
and I know exactly
what I'm doing.
And I've seen
people come and go.
And I just want...
I want...
I don't know
what to say to you, Bud.
Don't say anything.
(telephone rings)
Oh my God!
(ringing)
Uhm...
(ringing)
- Hello?
- Man: Grace, are you there?
I'm calling you from the plane,
are you there?
I can't hear you!
Can you hear me?
- Hello?!
- Grace: Yes, I can hear you.
Man: Great! If we get cut off
I'll call you right back.
All right?
So just sit by the phone.
- All right? Okay?
- Grace: Okay.
Man: Jesus, Grace! I called
to talk to you. Say something!
You talk.
Listen to this. They want me
to do The Tonight Show, right?
I told them, I get tired
going back to fucking New York,
and if you want me to do this
then you find a goddamn way!
- Grace? Can you fucking hear me?
- Grace: Yeah.
Man: Did you hear
what I've just said?
Grace: Yeah.
Man:
What do you think?!
I think it's great.
Man: Yeah, all right.
You talk for a while, okay?
And speak up
for Christ sakes!
- Hello?!
- Grace: Well,
you probably think
you're going to hate this but...
Man: All right, yeah, what?
I went walking through
the Farmer's Market today
and uh...
and I heard this saxophone,
out of nowhere, like an angel.
It was "Willow Weep For Me,"
by Ben Webster,
it was extraordinary, and...
Sam?
Sam?
(dial tone)
(phone rings)
Hello?
Collect call from who?
Oh yes.
Val?
Val, are you there?
Are you okay?
He punched you?
Are you okay?
When are you coming back?
I miss you too.
Oh, I just remembered...
Oh, I'm sweating,
I had this awful dream...
that these Vietnam soldiers...
Yeah, they're Vietnamese,
they broke into my room...
Yeah,
through the french windows...
Yeah, they had machine guns...
It sounds silly but it wasn't
silly in my dream, it was scary.
I'm lonely and scared?
How do you know?
Val?
Val?
(phone rings)
- Sam?
- Yeah, it's Sam.
Of course it's me.
Who else is it going to be?
So what happened?
- What happened?
- Sam: Yeah, the Ben Webster story?
I was reading the liner notes,
and you know they used
to call him "The Frog"?
And sometimes "The Brute."
Sam: Uh-huh?
Yeah.
Sam: So?
So...
It's so beautiful, Sam.
His sound.
Sam:
Are you asleep?! Or what?
I mean,
what are you talking about?!
I told you you'd hate it.
Oh for Christ's sakes,
I don't hate it.
Listen, I have been thinking
about you the whole time,
missing you.
I miss you too.
Sam: Do you remember
that DP on the movie,
the one that I told you about?
Right. I told him that you
were a writer and he went on,
telling me this story
about a student
who becomes obsessed with a poet,
a philosopher guy, right?
And he reads everything the poet
writes and taught himself French
so he could read the original poems
in their original form,
and he quits college and spends
all his money just to go to France
and find this poet.
And he gets there, and not only
does he meet the guy,
but he gets himself invited
to the old guy's house.
And, I mean, it is beautiful!
The sun is shining
through the windows,
he couldn't have dreamt
for a more perfect situation.
They sat down to lunch, he asked him
some questions he had prepared...
And the poet starts to answer,
and the student realizes
that he's forgotten
his tape recorder,
and since he's
self-educated from a book,
he doesn't understand a word
the guy says.
But the poet talks on and on
all afternoon enthusiastically,
with this great
knowing light in his eyes,
and the student just sits
opposite this guy,
not understanding
a word he says.
Too humble
or shy or whatever,
to assert himself,
and then he nodded his head,
thanked the poet and got back
on the plane, penniless.
But he did learn.
- Yeah.
- Sam: He learned...
that there are no answers.
I'm not a writer.
Sam: What?!
What?! What are you talking about?
Sounds wonderful.
Sam: Bullshit,
I didn't tell it any good,
you should've heard Jean Paul.
Listen, Grace,
I'm landing in 45 minutes,
- You want to pick me up?
- It's 5:00 in the morning.
Yeah, I know. Come on.
Grace: I don't...
What? You don't want to?
No, I mean...
- Sam: What?!
- I don't have $30 on me.
Sam: Oh bullshit!
That's an excuse!
It's not an excuse...
Sam: This is not about me.
You use money
and the lack of it
as an excuse.
Okay? I need you.
I feel like fucking shit!
My movie is horrible,
nobody likes it,
I'm exhausted, I feel sick,
I want to see you
- And you won't fucking do it!
- Oh my God, Sam.
Sam: What?!
I want to be there
but I just can't.
Sam: No, but you won't!
All right?
All right, fuck it, all right?
Fuck it! Fuck you!
(dial tone)
(hangs up)
(Grace sighs)
there's three of us.
That's my brother's.
Brian's.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, he's got a gun.
So, is this your brother's place?
No.
It's nice.
Yeah.
And then there's Michael.
Michael is a Jesuit.
A what?
A priest.
He lives in Italy.
He was a green beret
in Vietnam.
He got the purple heart.
He's God.
I wish I could meet him.
Yeah.
He lives in Italy.
At the Vatican.
Girl: The what?
Where the Pope is.
Oh.
And then there's Tom.
Tom's the youngest.
I did that to Tom.
I beat the shit
out of that kid.
When he was this big.
Why?
We all did.
So...
when he was caught...
Girl: Caught?
Someone told me once,
one of the detectives,
that some people
are born bad.
Terry:
What do you think?
I don't know.
Terry:
He's just about your age.
He wasn't born bad.
And he was beautiful.
When he smiled...
he just broke my heart.
He hardly ever did it.
It's the fucking streets.
You have to go to school tomorrow,
don't you?
Yeah.
High school?
Yeah.
Wow!
What?
You can put your clothes on.
I'm gonna take you home.
(telephone rings)
Sam: I don't understand why
you won't meet me at the airport.
Things are just starting
to go good with us,
and I think
you're fucking it up, okay?
- Grace, you're just...
- I'm just what, Sam?
Sam: You... you just don't care
about anything.
All right?
Not me, not yourself, not us.
You just don't care.
Hello?
I do care.
Sam: Well, listen, you know...
Goodnight, Sam.
Sam: Hold on a second.
I'll be getting in around...
(hangs up)
Wall: Hi.
Hello.
I'm Wall.
Grace: Hello, Wall.
Can you sleep over?
Hmm...
no, I don't think
I can sleep over, but...
I can come over sometime.
Sure.
I can take you over to
my friend Diane's house 'cause...
she has an aquarium and...
after that I was thinking
you could come over to my house
and read some Langston Hughes.
Some what?
Wall: Langston Hughes.
Where'd you get Langston Hughes?
My dad.
Oh. Is your dad a poet?
No. I don't know.
It's hard to say
who's really a poet.
You know?
Wall: I've got to go now.
The sun's coming up.
(door opens loudly)
(door bangs open)

Bud's voice: his grandfather
discovered gold...
..."Daddo?" Billy puts his hat back
to see his father.
He's here just to consider him
more of an institution...
...he's always still, like that.
I took a chance. I said, "I told her
that I had an unresolved pain,
that no one had
ever loved me enough."
I looked at her and said,
"I'll get better."
She said, "I hope so, honey."
It'd be hard not to love a girl
who says that all the time.
Then she tells me
about the sea,
she tells me that in the deep sea,
in the black sea,
there's a shaft of light
or moonbeam.
And the people who see that light
swim for miles.
...in the deep sea, in the black sea.
...they can't touch the rapture.
It's like a rainbow.
It seems like it's in your reach,
but it ain't.
My grandfather discovered gold
in this country.
He blazed a trail
that's still there today...
I ain't trying to have my heritage.
I'm part of something.
Can't you see!
He didn't care
about much else...
I know I'm not the only one left
still thinking about it.
Why is that a man can stand
in a corn field or in a river...?
So I took the hair
from her face.
Why does that same man
look at the one he loves...
...still live in the deep sea,
in the black sea.
"Where'd she go?" Daddo, asked.
No one ever
loved you enough, son.
...this was his land.
He was never in a hurry to get off it.

- Hey.

Are you okay?
Well,
I... I tried calling and...
you know, you're never there
or it's busy...
- Grace: Yeah.
- I was worried,
and I just came by
to check up on you.
Grace: Yeah, um...
I'm... I'm...
I've been working is all.
But... I'm fine.
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- You seem kind of sad tonight.
- Nah.
You just want
someone to talk to?
I was...
I was just walking by here,
and I thought of you.
I think about you sometimes when I...
when I walk by, you know?
Yeah.
How are you doing?
I've been working.
Well, I hope that
sometime you call me.
You know, you need something...
I know, Frank. I know.
I... I... I'll go.
I'll go.
I'm sorry for waking you.
I just wanted to see you're okay.
- Grace, I...
- I'm okay.
You know,
I thought that maybe sometime
we could have a cup of coffee...
and just talk.
Yeah. Maybe sometime.
And talk about life.
I don't know.
Yeah. Okay.
Uh...
Anyway, Grace, I...
Well...
okay, goodnight.
Grace: Goodnight.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Frank: Goodnight.

Bud's voice: No one

(tapping typewriter)
I'm sorry for that.
I give everyone
a 100% off the bat.
It doesn't matter
who it is either.
I'll give it all.
Whatever they take away
is their business,
makes no difference to me.
Poet: Can you hear the lovesick

Audrey: Why do you

I don't know.
Can I shave you?
Of course you can.
...I was just looking
at this picture...
Well, you know...
You know
how I feel about you.
Oh, really?
I didn't... I didn't know...
if you'd want
to talk to me.
Man: I don't use
a tape recorder.
I'll just take notes
if that's okay?
Woman: Sure, whatever. Yeah.
Man: So, tell me about him.
Just what comes to mind...
What's the insufferable
hunger of the damned?
Where did you find that?
In your pants pocket.
It's a title.
To what?
To anything I ever write.
He used to say that
success was incidental.
Because time moved too fast.
I guess I just called to...
I wanted to tell you that...
I had a real nice time
in Minneapolis with you.
And um...
you know, I was wondering if you
were coming out here because...
I really... I'd like to...
take you to dinner or out...
For Christmas?
Well, it's April...
(coin drops from payphone)
Hold on.
Why the "Insufferable
Hunger of the Damned"?
I don't know, it's...
it's the last thing
people want to see.
I was going to call it
"Eat Shit," but I...
I figured people
want to see that,
and you can be sure
no one wants to know about
the insufferable
hunger of the damned.
(tapping razor)
No, I think I'm going to be here
for a while.
That's just...
it...
It's just that
this ain't right.
I... I can't stand it.
I'm working all night,
I'm sleeping all day, and...
You know, this is boring.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, in July, I was thinking,
I was going to go up to Duluth,
have you ever been there?
Yeah.
Just, you know, going fishing and...
live right.
No, I've got
some family up there.
Is it about us?
Yeah.
It's... everybody.
That's the point.
Well, I'd been around the block
a few times before I met him.
So... I knew,
for fact, mind you,
not a rumor,
that he had read the same poem,
in the same way
to another woman,
in the same week
that he had read it to me.
I didn't mind his duplicity.
There's something beautiful about
a man who loves too much...
you know, that kind of playboy
I've always understood.
But he doesn't love anyone.
He loves art, he loves...
he loves sex.
(tapping)
I'd say...
that he never loved me.
He had no respect for me, really.
He thought he did.
But...
when you love someone
and they don't even know
they don't respect you,
you've got a real problem
on your hands.
Tell me the dream
one more time.
We, uh...
we were walking
in Central Park,
and it was snowing,
and the snow was untouched
except for the footprints
behind us,
and we were wearing overcoats,
the expensive kind and...
we were older and...
we were happy.
All I ever think about
is my music.
I go to bed thinking about it,
I wake up thinking about it...
I guess that's why
I don't have anyone, you know.
There's no room.
I just... I don't...
I just feel like I'm...
going nowhere fast.
Audrey: I wish we were
in that dream right now.
So do I.
I'll buy you
a fishing license.
I'll bet you no one
has ever offered you that before.
(coin dropping)
Yeah.
Well...
if you ever
do come out here,
or if ever I get home,
I would like to take you out.
The core of him was...
and probably still is,
cold.
It said,
"Baby,
if it's me or you,
it's got to be me."
And...
I may have a million faults
and I've made
thousands of mistakes,
but I've never
been able to look
into the eyes of the one I love
with cold eyes.
And...
he could do that.
He did do that.
Take this and...
don't resist.
I can't.
Look,
if you love me
you'll take it
and you'll take care
of yourself.
I'll be back.
Bud: Get the hell out!
Bud, it's me.
It's you?
There's your goddamn book!
- Where?
- You're standing on it.
This, uh?
Yeah, that.
I'll make some coffee.
Oh, that's real subtle.
Why don't you throw me in
a cold shower while you're at it?
It's not a bad idea.
Jesus Christ!
You come in here,
you come in here
like you're my old lady
and give me that look
like I have to clean up my room.
You wanted a book?
Well, you got a book.
At least you put
page numbers on it.
"At least you put
page numbers on it."
I'm not a baby!
I don't need
to be patronized like this!
No! I will not!
I refuse for you
to speak to me like that!
I guess you never get over
a man like that.
It's very painful
to fall in love with someone
in the confines of four walls
where you share everything.
To be silent
while they work for...
days sometimes.
To be...
taken into it,
into them,
their body, spirit.
To be...
worshiped and...
magnified, immortalized.
And then to see that
to them,
to Bud,
it's work.
I brought you something, I've...
you left your St. Christopher
in my office.
Oh, yeah,
the clasp was broken.
I had it fixed.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks
a whole hell of a lot.
And I gave
a part of my life to him,
and I did it willingly.
And...
I'd like to say,
and I...
I never have before, that...
I was...
very much in love with
a great, great man.
Who despite everything,
didn't know
Iove.
- Man: I'm glad to see you.
- Val: Yeah.
Man #2: Come on, guys.
(screeching)
Poet: Now I am a man
no more.
No more.
And the black reward
for a roaring life,
Sighed the old ramrod,
dying of bitches!
Tidy and cool
in my dove cooed room
I lie down thin and hear
the good bells jaw...
For, oh, my soul
found a Sunday wife
in the coal black night
and she bore angels!
Harpies around me
out of her womb.
Chastity prays for me,
piety sings
Innocence sweetens
my last black breath,
Modesty covers
my thighs with her wings.
And all of the deadly virtues
plague...
my death.
(police radio buzzing faintly)
(knocking on door)
(knocking)
(knocking)
Poet: clocks with no hands!
Forever drumming out time
without ever knowing
what time it is!
Bud: Christ,
I think I'm...
I think I'm hungry.
I...
I think I'm...
just a little...
tired.
That's all right.
Let me get you
something to eat and then...
we'll put
those pages together.
No, no, no.
- Didn't anyone ever tell you?
- Tell me what?
That all the king's horses
and all the king's men
couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty
back together again.
Woman's voice:
I sat there with you,
you hung on me
with the weight of a bear,
heavy after some coffee...
Val: who has
the last word from paradise.
She came back alive enough to feed
the black tongue of a giraffe.
Audrey: The memory's landscape
is enormous.
Woman: where men and women
really do hate each other.
I knew that.
You are another Hamlet.
Ross: For as
the sailor's proverb goes,
a sea refuses no river.
Grace: Is there nothing quite
like the face of a losing man?
A soldier, a boxer,
a lover, a boy.
They know.
That greatness falls...
Frank: Only an American
would bring a canary
down with him
in the mines.
Only an American
would make a sport
where you could
steal home and win.
Audrey: just wanting
to leave the scene.
Beautifully leave you.
In the dust,
in the jungle,
luminous in your shadow.
