The Great Wall has
stood for centuries
as one of mankind's
most enduring wonders.
It spans over 5500 miles
and took more than
1700 years to build.
It protected from many dangers.
Some are known. Some are legend.
This is one of the legends.
THE GREAT WALL
Najid, cut the horses loose.
We have to turn back.
We have been riding
for six months.
And we've lost 20 men.
But we survived.
Yes. By chance.
Any one of us could have
met that same fate.
We were the strongest.
Remember why you're here.
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.
At least here, we
have a common goal.
Oh, yes.
This black powder.
It turns air into fire.
And kills a dozen men at one time.
It is the weapon of our dreams.
And what if it's just a myth?
Men have sent word that it's real.
And those men are dead.
And we are next.
We have no maps,
no medicine
and no food.
No one is going back.
We take inventory of
what we have left
and finish what we started.
There's not much here.
The moon is strong.
When the horses are
fresh, we move.
- To where?
- North.
If they keep after us, we'll
kill them in the mountains.
The magnet.
Too heavy.
Useless. I'll have it.
It's all yours.
Amigo, only you would carry a
stupid magnet through the desert.
I can use it to make a compass.
Rizzetti won't make it.
The wound is festering.
We'll be dragging a corpse.
I heard that.
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.
I've been left for dead twice.
It was bad luck. For who?
The people who left me.
Maybe Rizzetti's right.
Where are they?
Hill tribes?
It's no man.
Then what is it?
Whatever it is, it's hunting.
What was that? I don't know.
I took its hand.
- We need to move.
- Agreed.
I'll take the hand with us.
What the hell for?
So someone can tell me
what I just killed.
Persistent bastards, aren't they?
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.
What a long shitting
way to go to die.
Mother of God.
I have no need to
go down fighting.
Agreed.
I say we take our chances with
the gents in front of us.
I haven't surrendered in a while?
It'll come back to you.
Follow my lead, we'll be fine.
Of course, my friend.
Where you go, I follow.
You're doing such a
great job already.
All Commanders to the Great Hall.
All Commanders report
to the General.
Make way. Make way.
All Commanders to the
Great Hall. Make way.
Commander Lin is
needed immediately.
Calling Commander Lin.
Commander Lin is
needed immediately.
They know what it is.
And they don't look
happy to see it.
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.
Our weapons are on that table.
Have you lost your mind?
I can take out the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.
I must confess, this is
not my favourite plan.
Where was this found?
You speak English.
Fantastic.
Where was this found?
It wasn't found.
It was taken.
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.
Where?
Two days ride.
North, in the mountains.
He says two days ride
north, in the mountains.
- They claim to have killed it.
- Two days?
Earlier than we expected.
Strategist Wang.
- I'm listening, General.
- The two of them killed it?
Two of you, you did this?
Well...
I killed it.
Alone?
He claims to have killed it alone.
- By himself?
- Impossible.
Tell me how.
A swing of the sword.
The hand, it came away clean.
The beast fell back into a chasm.
Why are you here?
We came to trade.
We were ambushed.
Guards.
You are soldiers.
Commander Lin. Wait.
General. They claim to be
traders who were ambushed.
- These barbarians are liars.
- Perhaps not.
They brought the claw
here. The wound is fresh.
There is green blood on his
sword. Those prove his story.
To protect our secret,
we must kill them.
Eliminate the
possibility of trouble.
I agree.
We should kill them.
General, until we find the truth,
I advise we keep them alive.
Alert.
General, signals from the smoke
towers. We are under attack.
Take them to stockade.
- All stations on full alert.
- All stations on full alert.
Are you killing us, sister?
Two lost travellers?
What's happening here, amigo?
Is this bitch going to kill us?
I think she'd like that.
If it is death, my dear,
we need time to pray.
I'm trying here.
Sister, I know a siege
when I see one.
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?
What the hell did
we kill out there?
Tao Tei.
You killed a Tao Tei scout.
You killed it alone.
You're correct.
We are under siege.
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.
Attack? Tao Tei.
What the hell is a Tao Tei?
Many things about your
story have importance.
You are not to die today.
Hurry.
- I'm sorry, sir. I
cannot find the key.
Forget it. Bring them to the
Wall. Keep an eye on them.
- General. It's finally happening.
- Yes.
Sixty years preparing
for this moment.
Stop. Stop.
Go. Go.
Inside.
Stand still.
Get down. Get down.
The black are the foot soldiers.
And the red?
Those are the archers.
And the blue?
They're all women.
What the hell do they do?
Look at this army.
Have you ever seen
anything like this?
Incredible.
Catch it.
They look nervous.
It's a big wall to be so nervous.
Do you hear it?
- Long distance weapons.
- Yes.
Drums signal long
distance weapons.
Grab it.
Light it.
Aim for the eyes.
Aim for the eyes.
Crane Corps attack.
William, over there.
Why isn't he tied up?
There's our escape.
General, there is the
Queen. She commands them.
Attack the Queen.
- Close combat.
- Yes. Close combat.
Drums signal close combat.
We need to move.
We need to move or we die.
Go, go.
Go and fight.
Cut me loose.
Fight or run?
Run where?
Aim for the eyes.
William.
Hey. Bitch.
William.
I need a shot.
What god made those things?
None that we know.
Think they'll hang us now?
I could use the rest.
You fought well today.
You've earned General
Shao's praise.
Will they come back?
Yes.
All we can do is prepare.
Take them to the barracks.
They need rest.
Yes.
Thank you for saving my life.
Commandeer Lin. You grew
up in the Nameless Order.
I've taught you many things...
And you have been learning,
but they have been learning also.
Strategist Wang warned
they are evolving.
No one listened.
The enemies we're facing today
are more intelligent
than sixty years ago.
Watch the foreigners closely.
They can never leave.
We must protect the
secrets of the Wall.
Yes, sir.
Who are you?
Easy.
I'm Ballard.
William.
This is Tovar.
What are you doing here?
We came looking for black powder.
I bet you did.
I came with mercenaries
for the same thing.
Twenty-five years ago.
And did you find it?
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.
We weren't being diplomatic.
We were trying to stay alive.
- You smell like animals.
- Thank you.
Clean up
and they'll feed you.
He knows where the powder is.
Then why is he still here?
He needs help getting out?
Right.
We play our part,
take the powder and go home.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which part?
Well, all of it. But
mostly the monsters.
There's a lot of them.
We really do smell.
General Shao welcomes
you as honoured guests
of the Nameless Order and thanks
you for your skill and courage.
We are honoured to be honoured.
Is that the best you've got?
General.
I couldn't help wondering,
why would such an accomplished
archer, use such a primitive bow.
Commander Chen thinks your bow
is not worthy of your skill.
Tell him there's no
better weapon here.
He claims his weapon
is second to none.
Let him show us.
Give him some space.
They wish to see you shoot.
In here?
Unless he is afraid.
It's a large audience.
What was that?
He thinks you have fear.
Too many people.
Get one of the cups.
- Now?
- Get one of the cups.
I want to eat.
You remember how to do this?
Last time didn't go so
good. We were drunk.
How high?
Ten yards. Six hands to the right.
Turn around.
No, I'll do it this way.
On my count. Amigo...
One.
Two.
Three.
Pull.
Good luck with that.
I want food.
Who taught you English?
Sir Ballard.
English and Latin.
Heard he's been here for 25 years.
You won't let him leave.
He must stay here.
What about us?
Pace yourself.
The meals are regular here.
I hope not to stay that long.
I like your thinking,
but I suggest you keep
your plans private.
You aren't the first Westerners
to come here looking
for black powder.
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.
How long have you been here?
Always.
I was not five years
old when I came here.
I have no other family.
We're the same.
I was given to an army
before I can remember.
As a soldier?
Worse. As a gleaner.
Packs of children, we'd
clean the battlefields.
After, when the fighting's over.
I became a page, a
pikeman's boy...
For your country?
No. I fought for food.
You fight to eat.
You live long enough,
you fight for money.
How many flags do you fight for?
I don't know.
I fought for Harold
against the Danes.
I saved a Duke's life. I
fought for him until he died.
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.
Fought for the Franks
against Boulogne.
I fought for the Pope.
Many flags.
We are not the same.
Meet me on the Wall. I have
something to show you.
He should be careful with her.
She's very powerful here.
Then it is a fair contest.
Come.
You wish to try?
Men are too heavy. Do you
think we can pull him up?
She says men have so
much to teach us.
I don't think that's
what she said.
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid.
You said that this morning.
And yet,
here I am. Yes.
Here you are.
Will you jump? Or not?
These men know what they're doing?
Wrong question.
Whether or not the
cable is attached,
that is the question.
And the answer?
Trust.
Xin ren.
Xin ren.
Xin ren means trust.
To have faith.
Here, in this army,
we fight for more
than food or money.
We give our lives
to something more.
Xin ren is our flag.
Trust in each other.
In all ways, at all times.
Well, that's all well and
good, but I'm not jumping.
I'm alive today because
I trust no one.
A man must learn to trust
before he can be trusted.
Then you were right.
We're not the same.
Stay vigilant. The
next attack is coming.
My God.
A taste, a glimpse.
A few pilfered grains
from Strategist
Wang's supply of black powder.
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.
People speak of a weapon.
There are many weapons here.
Why have we not seen them?
There are many things
you have not seen.
And many things you should
pray will not be needed
before the siege is through.
The Tao Tei will return.
When the drums call to battle,
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.
That is our moment.
We want to be riding away
as the battle rages.
And the armoury
doors? You have keys?
I have black powder.
Enough for several doors.
He brings us in. We get us out.
Strategist Wang
requests your presence.
As you fought, where
was this stone?
In my bag.
Its unseen force is powerful.
I believe this strange
stone could help us.
We try everything.
Where are the Tao Tei now?
The mountains, regrouping.
Where do they come from?
About 20 centuries ago,
there was an emperor
whose greed brought
deep suffering to all of China.
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,
turning it green and
releasing the Tao Tei.
From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years
to scourge the north of China.
They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.
They eat anything, alive or dead,
and take food to their queen.
She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.
The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 Li away.
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,
no corner of the
world would be safe.
You can't hunt them?
Men try.
They disappear.
We never find their bones.
Troops unaccounted for
at the West Tower.
Why did they leave the bodies?
Dismount.
Formation.
Advance.
Stop.
Commander Lin.
General...
They led us into a trap.
We underestimated
their intelligence.
The Nameless Order...
is yours to command.
General...
Commanders, this
is my final order.
From this day forward,
Commander Lin will lead you.
The soldiers of Nameless
Order will stand firm.
The Wall must not fall. We
will defeat the Tao Tei.
- Rest in peace.
- Rest in peace.
This is envoy Shen
from the palace.
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.
This is 900-year-old
battle report.
A 900-year-old battle report.
At the Hansha gates,
three beasts mounted the Wall.
They killed many men
as they went forward.
Then, by the grace
of the ancient gods,
the beasts stopped...
and sat peacefully as
we slaughtered them.
There was a magnet on
site just like this one.
At the Hansha Gate, was a
magnet just like this one.
I believe that magnet was the
reason that two of you Westerners
killed the Tao Tei so easily.
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.
Without instruction,
they fall still.
How to prove it?
How can we be sure?
Why not try it?
Capture a Tao Tei.
See if it works.
He wants to try. He
wants to catch one.
How?
No net is strong enough.
Hunt them. Like a whale.
You know what that is.
A water beast.
Hundred times the
size of a Tao Tei.
A spear that grabs. Hook
the bone. Pull them up.
Use a spear, hook them.
So we can catch them.
I've seen it done in Spain.
He claims to have seen
it done it Spain.
What the hell are you doing?
We need to be free
when the attack comes.
How many chances do you
think we will get?
Be injured. Be
missing. Be a coward.
Get out of this.
We did enough.
The mixture must be strong to
put the creatures to sleep.
- Spread it on evenly.
- Yes, Commander.
Snap out of it.
Useless idiot. Report
to the kitchen
- where you belong.
- Yes, Commander.
Go.
He'll be here.
- When?
- When it's over?
We start and he will find us.
Start?
We're jumping off a cliff here.
I have everything.
Powder, tools, maps.
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.
Once we start,
there's no going back.
- Death Squad ready.
- Yes. Death Squad go.
Blades ready.
Blades forward.
- Attack.
- Go.
Left. Right.
- I'll find him.
- Forget him.
He'd rather die trying to
impress the new general than
grab the key to every counting
room and brothel in the world.
Good God, man. The time is now.
I can't go without him.
More the spoils for us.
We need his bow.
Harpoons.
Harpoons, now.
Fire.
- There.
- Move.
It's the last one.
Pull.
No, no, no. Stop.
Hold.
There's too much tension.
Chain will break.
That way. That way.
Let him run.
Stop. Stop.
We need longer for the
sleeping potion to work.
That way. That way.
We need to isolate it.
Separate it from the others.
- Ring of fire.
- Yes. Ring of fire.
The chain won't hold much longer.
We're losing it.
William, wait.
- Screaming arrows.
- Yes. Screaming arrows.
These arrows will scream
as the Tao Tei run.
Aim for the sound.
Aim inside the circle.
Blanket the whole area.
Fire.
Pull.
I'm only saving you so
I can kill you myself.
Grab an axe, we're fighting blind.
Not yet. I know what to do.
The fire's not holding them back.
Die well, brother.
What the hell are you doing?
She's listening.
- Prepare black powder weapons.
- Prepare black powder weapons.
Prepare to light the fuses.
Yes. Prepare to light the fuses.
Did it work?
Yes. The beast was captured.
My friend...
He was unharmed.
Why did you go over the Wall?
Xin ren.
Did I say it right?
Thank you.
Black powder.
It is a terrible weapon.
It would be better if
you had never seen it
I know very little of
the outside world.
But it seems to me,
the greed of men is not that
different from the Tao Tei.
Is that true?
The strong take what they want.
Forget what you have seen.
Excellent. Send it to the
capital immediately.
No.
We need to study it here.
If Tao Tei is captured alive,
it must be sent to the Emperor.
This is an Imperial Order.
You're much braver
than they think.
You wounded?
I was looking for you.
To say thank you.
You feel good, huh?
Maybe you sing a little song?
I will join you.
We can sing together how you
saved the grateful chinos.
You saw what happened out there
and that's what you say?
I see black powder.
I see a man forget his friends.
The black powder's
not going anywhere.
What goes nowhere is you.
You'll never get what
you want from this.
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?
A man of virtue?
Maybe you can fool them,
but I know what you are.
You know what you are.
A thief,
a liar,
and a killer.
And you can never undo the
things you have done,
and you will never be anything.
Good to see you again, amigo.
Tao Tei movement.
All troops to the Wall.
- Nothing?
- No.
How do you know he
won't betray us?
I don't.
They'll kill him. They'll
kill him no matter what.
The time they spend killing him
is time they are not chasing us.
Careful with that.
There's powder here.
Tovan
General, it goes all
the way through.
Tao Tei have breached the Wall.
They're smarter than we thought.
Summon my commanders immediately.
Yes, General.
Have a look. See if it's gone out.
Is it safe?
Of course it is.
Shake it off, man. To work.
I thought you said it was safe?
We're in, aren't we?
You're here.
We've come to our senses?
Ballard has planned well.
Getting out is easy.
There's a gate. 20 miles west.
We dodge the hill tribes.
We can make it.
They need us here.
They need more than us.
These people are doomed.
Don't be a fool.
I've been a fool.
I'm done with it.
Brother, please.
We've been fighting for nothing.
For greed.
Amigo, after all the blood,
and cold, and pain,
with this black powder
in our saddle bags,
we win.
You come with me.
I can't do that now.
Stay and fight.
William...
Think he's dead?
It'd take a lot more than that.
All of the attacks have been a
diversion, while they
dug this tunnel.
They have breached the
Wall. Once they reach the
capital, nothing in the
world can stop them.
At a full gallop, it's
2 days to the capital.
There is no way we can catch them.
The wind is strong now.
It blows from the north all day
tomorrow. We have to
use the balloons.
If it works, how
long to Bianliang?
Six hours if the wind holds.
If we make it alive.
General, none of the
tests have worked.
Get ready.
Come on.
Hyah.
THE CAPITAL BIANLIANG
- How did you capture it?
- Your Excellency.
It's the magnet. It keeps the
beast under the control.
This is the most
important discovery
in the history of the Tao Tei.
We will investigate immediately.
Bring him here.
I tried to stop them...
You dare to speak to me?
I didn't do this.
And you came here to trade.
And you knew nothing
of black powder.
What a fool you must think I am.
If I was with them,
why would I be here?
I tried to stop them. I tried...
Liar.
You lie.
Some part of you knows
that's not true.
If I were not the General,
I would kill you myself.
General.
- General.
- Speak up.
I was there when it happened.
I saw him try to stop them.
Are you sure?
If you're lying,
I'll have your head.
I swear on my vow to
the Nameless Order.
Lock him up. Send the
cavalry. Go after
- the two that got away.
- Yes, General.
Which way, left or right?
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.
Hyah.
No.
No. Bastard.
- Keep it steady.
- Yes, General.
- Watch the powder.
- Yes, General.
What happened?
What happened?
We have failed.
The Tao Tei are in the Kingdom.
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.
This was the General's
final order.
Where is she?
To do what?
To fight?
Is there a chance?
There's only one.
Kill the Queen.
Kill the Queen, or we all die.
Leave.
Tell the world what you have seen,
and tell them what is coming.
I'll need my bow.
If I'm to join you,
I'll need my bow.
Strategist Wang. Please
take me with you.
He wishes to join us.
Distance is the key.
The magnet is only
effective when close to the beast.
Therefore, the effect weakens
as it gets further away.
You see I have it under
complete control.
Write down nine feet.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No, don't throw that
thing near fire.
- Steer to the rear of the palace.
- Yes. To the rear of the palace.
Above you.
- Light a grenade.
- Yes, sir.
Behind you.
I set you free.
And here I am.
There's the Queen.
They will not attack while
the Queen is feeding.
We have a chance.
Hold on.
State your purpose.
General Lin Mae of the Nameless
Order. At your service.
What took you so long?
The Tao Tei have overrun the city.
Thousands of soldiers
and innocents are dead.
You're too late.
Your Majesty, where is
the captured Tao Tei?
- In the dungeon.
- We need to kill the Queen.
Once she is dead, the Tao
Tei cannot function.
Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.
There is an underground
canal here.
Has it been breached?
The Tao Tei should
all be above ground.
And the one we captured?
We load it up.
We feed it.
And it will return to its Queen.
Good.
You'll have one hell of a
scar, but you'll live.
He says you will live.
We'll come back for him.
They've broken through.
Patience, William.
And it will go to the
Queen when it's done?
It should.
It will.
Let it in.
I can get a shot from above.
Go. I'll hold them back.
Wait. Not yet.
Hit.
Go higher.
I'll get a better shot.
General.
It's up to you now.
We have one black
powder weapon left.
Give me the spear.
I've trained for
this my whole life.
Trust.
I'll get you the shot.
I've got you.
So, how's life without me?
A little slow.
You're a hero after all.
Well, it looks that way.
You seem pleased with yourself.
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?
A bag of gold?
A victory parade along
the top of the Wall?
All the black powder I can carry.
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?
Well, would you blame me?
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.
And the time before that,
I saved your life.
True.
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.
I could take the black powder,
or I could take you.
Please tell me you
chose the powder?
I don't even know you any more.
The horses are
saddled and waiting.
Best we ride before nightfall.
I'll be inside.
Don't leave without me.
I came to say goodbye.
I understand congratulations
are in order.
General of the
northwest territory.
That's quite an honour.
Seems you've made your choice.
Him?
Believe me, I'm already
thinking about
trading him back for the powder.
I heard that.
Perhaps we were both wrong.
We are more similar
than I thought.
Thank you, General.
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?
Of course I do.
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.
