Make way
Make way
How are you?
I am good
A drunken driving case
I gave first aid
One moment
Here's the patient's bag
What did the nurse say?
How is the guy?
Everything in the bag is safe
We are buddies
Give me the money
You always suspect me
I have mended my ways
Don't embarrass me in public
Here it is
It's getting late
Go on, check me, check me
That's my money
I will bite you
It's my money
Whose money?
My money
This is your money eh?
Listen to me, buddy
We saved his life
What if someone had gone
to the accident spot...
...would we have known that?
Taking a small amount from his bag
is not wrong at all
A outsider knows about me
You are my only friend
why don't you understand?
Just give me 100 bucks for a drink
You don't know how to live
Take all these reports
The lab is to your left
I have victim's wallet,
gold chain and ring
I've informed his family
Give this to them
Bye
Okay, Sathya
Don't feel bad
Come on
Sathya, have you started?
Yes
I will be there in half an hour
How's your ballon-faced Dad?
Don't you have any
respect for my dad?
Fathers-in-law should
respect sons-in-law
He has great attitude
He was smoking cigarette yesterday
Ask him to respect me a bit
Okay sir, you come with the same attitude
and maintain your attitude
Don't worry, when he sees me
He will be flabbergasted
Okay enough
Come quickly
Bye
Did you inform your mother?
First, let me see if her
dad likes me
Then I will inform my mom
You could have respected him
when he was alive
What do you want?
I need some money for dinner
You are earning more than me
What do you do with your salary?
My phone bills are too high
If you keep paying your girlfriends'
phone bills, this is what will happen
That's not true
I don't have cash
From today onwards I will change
Believe me
You have been saying this for years
Go and get drunk
Take this
You will flourish
Thank you
All the best
You are so kind
Convey my regards to
your girl friend
You owe my 6000 rupees, till now
Stop
- Where are you going?
- Sathya has come
First our Dad should talk to him
Till then, hold your horses
Come in
Please be seated
Dad will come now
What would you like to have?
He likes coffee
Yes, I will have coffee
Okay
Hello, sir
Hello!
Take your seat
Lord Muruga!
Ok, tell me
My daughter has told me
a lot about you
How long have you known each other?
Five years
What do you do?
I am working as an EMT
I am a paramedic in an ambulance
What is your caste?
Dont worry
I was pulling your leg
I like you
Move away
I will make the coffee
He looks handsome today, eh?
He is handsome
You can be proud to do such a noble
job of saving lives
But how much do you earn?
How will you manage after marriage?
After marriage your expenses will increase
kids, schooling etc, etc
I have a suggestion
I have various business
Petty shop, Xerox, Stationary and Bakery
You can take care of one business
Hey what are you doing?
He is my husband,
so it's okay if I taste it
I will go and give it to him
No, I will do it
Don't worry about the business
I will take care of everything,
you take care of the cash counter
I want both of you to be happy
Give him coffee
Take it
As a father I'm very happy
Please have the coffee
I need a day's time to decide
Who can say no to this offer?
Take your time
Dad, ask him to have lunch and go
Have lunch and go
It's okay
Next time, I will have it
I know, you don't like to have food
till you finalize the wedding
Not like that
I will come on some other day
Bye
Who do you think you are?
You think you are a Collector?
What's there to decide?
They should be worried about this marriage
You are destined to toil with
medicine and blood
'You had dinner, dear?'
Hello?
'This is your future wife speaking'
Go on
'What are you doing?
Have you had dinner?'
You sound so formal
My sister told me that
I should address my
husband with respect
'Sir, how are you?'
'How do you do, sir?'
What do you want to tell me?
I never thought my father would say 'yes'
to our marriage so easily
But why did you ask for more time?
That's some attitude you have
Wait till I get my hands on you
I have a headache
Shall we talk later?
You didn't feel like
calling me back, eh?
Keep thinking think properly
It's been 5 years now
Maybe you're bored with me
Just tell me it's over between us
Good-bye

Kailasam
Kailasam
Agasthiarpatti
It's urgent
We're going to Agasthiarpatti
Why?
It's really urgent
Patient's had a heart attack
I have to meet my girlfriend
I can't come
'Have you decided about us?'
Can you tell us the way to
Agasthiarpatti?
Where exactly do you want to go?
North Street
Is Kailasam having chest pains?
Yes
The ambulance can't get through
The road's really bad
You have to walk
Its near the temple,
the second house facing south
Okay
How far is it from here?
Not far, it's nearby
Okay
Any place to eat along the way?
What's going on?
I can't walk
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
We're supposed to be equals
Why can't you carry it?
Tell them the vehicle has a flat tyre
Get another vehicle
Or send another driver to carry this
Does this seem nearby to you?
Kailasam, Kailasam
Go and pick up the patient yourself
I'm not coming
Where is Kailasam's house?
This is his house
What do you want?
We got a call saying
he's having chest pains
We came to take him to hospital
He lives alone
Go inside
Kailasam, sir
We're from the emergency service
I say he's dead
Let's take this and scram?
Shut up
Kailasam, sir
Where are you?
Can you hear me?
He seems to be a big shot!
Sir, are you all right?
Where's your blood pressure monitor?
Where is the blood pressure monitor?
Sorry, sir
What's your name?
Sir?
Name?
Sathya
Your name?
Arumugam
Ambulance pilot
You're just the driver?
Why are you wearing a doctor's coat?
Put the BP sleeve on properly
Sorry, sir
How long have you been in this job?
7 years
How many people have you killed?
My records are in a bag in the other room
Bring it to me
What's my BP?
160 by 90
Give him the records
Bring my Red shirt from that room
I'm not your servant
I'm a patient
Please help me
Sir, have you ever had
a heart attack before?
Yes, 27 times
Sir, can you please be quick?
I'm the patient, not you, right?
Sir, we're already late
I told you to bring one shirt
You keep asking for stuff
Put it all back
Go on
Come on, sir, let's go
You're taking me on the stretcher,
aren't you?
It's a long way to the vehicle
It would be better if you walked
If I were dead, what would you do?
But you're not dead
What did you say?
You look fine
That's all
I can't walk
You expect a heart attack
patient to walk?
Okay, sir
Put it down
Put it down
Lie down
Lie down
Go on
I can't lie down
If I lie down,
I'll start wheezing
Now what?

"We float on it"

I heard you saw a movie yesterday
'Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya'
It had my favourite actress in it
So you liked the movie?
Heroine is awesome
When you return
We can see it together
See you
Take care
Enough Stop
Come on, let's go
How long will it take to get
to the hospital?
We'll try to go as fast as possible
Are you all right?
Are you short of breath?
If you feel uncomfortable, tell me
Sir, please don't touch that
It's not a toy
Don't put your foot there
That's for patients
I'm a patient too
'My father treated you with respect'
'I don't know what else to do?'
Kavya, have you eaten?
I'm not Hungry
If I met with an accident,
what would you do?
What could I do?
I would take you to the hospital
You wouldn't cry?
What's your problem?
Leave it
Just answer this
What if my Dad forced me to
marry another person?
If you invite me,
I will come to your marriage
If not, I won't come
Who do you think you are?
Don't shout
Do you want to ditch me?
No one can separate us
I won't leave you
Truly?
Are you pulling my leg?
Eat it
Come on everyone, out here
Stop, stop
Don't just stand there
Bring the patient
Have you lost your minds?
Why did you stop our ambulance?
There's a sick man here
Take him with you
If it's serious,
call another ambulance
Don't stop this vehicle
Why can't you take him?
It's your job
We have another patient with us
That's not my problem
But you have to take this patient
The patient in the ambulance is seriously ill
Please try to understand
Listen to me, we can't take
2 patients at a time in the ambulance
You can't leave here
without taking him
Why can't you understand?
If you don't take him,
we won't let you leave this place
Ok, go and check the patient condition
This is my area
I make the decisions here
Any relative of the patient here?
He's my son-in-law
I'll follow behind you
Go on
Make way
Give way to the ambulance
Everybody get back to your business
How is he?
Hey, I'm talking to you
He's a piss tank,
a drunk like you
His pulse is normal
He hasn't consumed poison
He's as drunk as a skunk,
not to worry
We'll drop him nearby
(curses under breath)
Nothing to worry
We're going to the hospital
Calm down
Relax
I'm gonna die
I wanna die
I want to die
I want to die
Be relaxed
I'm gonna kill myself
I keep on saying I wanna die
Aren't you guys even gonna
bother to ask why?
Are you humans or monsters?
Doctor
Why do you want to die?
You're the first real human
I've ever met
You're not a human
You're a God
Love failure, sir
I was madly in love for seven years
Whenever she called me, I was there
Any time of day or night
I was like an ATM
ATMs get stuck sometimes, but not me
I ignored my parents and
their well-being
Just one look from her was
enough for me
I'd lay the whole world at her feet
Don't you have any other job?
What other job should I have?
This is my only job
A girlfriend should be guarded
twenty-four seven
Maintaining a love affair
is hard work
Make one mistake,
someone else will snatch her away
A guy came between us
An old curmudgeon,
exactly like you
I don't know where her
father came from
But he had long list of conditions
I had to have a good job,
fancy car and big house
Love doesn't come with conditions
It comes from the bottom of your heart
Her father ruined everything
Fathers shouldn't be spared
They'll never change
There should be a law
There should be a law that says
girls in love should not have fathers
Who would allow their daughter
to marry a nutcase like you?
Sir, please be quiet
Doctor, I'll solve this problem
Do I look like a madman to you?
Yes, you're a crazy useless bum
You're calling me a bum? Eh?
Okay, I'm a bum
Ask your daughter
why she fell in love with this bum?
My daughter's not as clever as you
But you're clever, aren't you?
After the wedding,
You'll be so busy
Producing four or five snot-nosed brats
How do you plan to feed them?
You're trying to trick me with logic
You should've taught your daughter
My dearest darling sweetest daughter
You must only love a guy who has
a good job, status and money
You should've taught her well
Or arranged a rich guy to marry
If you'd done that
I wouldn't be in trouble now
No one tells their parents when
they fall in love
Should people ask permission?
Lovers do everything on the sly
If I'd known this earlier,
I'd never have allowed it
You call me a madman?
Yes, you are
Okay, I am mad
I'm a crazy bum
Just watch what this madman
is going to do
I could kill myself by
jumping out of here
Go on, jump
Who's stopping you?
Let go of me
I gonna die myself
He's alive
Help me lift him
Hey, old man
You thought I wouldn't jump, eh?
Why can't you keep quiet?
I'm not gonna die
when you tell me to die
Check his leg for a fracture
But I am gonna kill myself now
Even if you beg at my feet,
I'm still gonna die
Hey oldie, I took the decision
I want to die
I'll die in front of your eyes
I'm gonna hang myself
Hold him
Let go of me
Go and get the first aid kit
I'm gonna die
Go and bring it
I'm gonna die
Find me a girl or let me die
Now he wants me to find
a girl for him
I'll run you over with the ambulance
and kill you myself
Where are we now?
The tour bus is stopping here
for ten minutes
Are you making fun of me?
You're roaming around with
a heart patient
Sure, they'll throw money at us
with a circus freak show like you
My son is a journalist
When he finds out how you're
treating me, you're finished
That drunk was a small fry
So we took him to a small hospital
But you're a big shot
So we're taking you
to a big hospital
Till then, please excuse us
Damn his looks!
What's wrong, Arumugam?
Are you angry?
What?
What's your problem?
You're crossing the limit
No, you're crossing the limit
Please go and sit inside, sir
He is a old man
Is this any way to talk to a patient?
Where are you, Sathya?
I'm at a dispensary in Pudhur
Why did you take the heart
patient to a dispensary?
Some villagers stopped the ambulance
and forced us to take another patient
Is this a public bus line?
We didn't do anything
The villagers forced us
It was a suicide attempt
Why didn't you inform the office?
Idiot
If anything happens to the heart patient?
Who has to answer for it?
The patient is fine, sir
Don't play doctor
Do as I tell you
Take the heart patient to
the hospital immediately
Learn to obey orders
Sorry, Sir
What happened?
The supervisor is mad at me
Ever since the old guy came on board,
things have been going south
I'll take the shortcut which
should save some time
What?
A flat tyre?
Yes, sir
Where are you now?
Kalyanapuram
What are you doing there?
Are you trying to cost me my job?
No, sir
To save time we took
a short cut but
Idiot, there's an accident
on the highway
Other ambulances have
been sent there
Don't know what to do
How's the patient now?
His ECG is normal, is BPs 160/90
He's okay
There's no problem for
the time being
Get the patient to
the hospital quickly
Okay, sir
From now on, keep me
informed on everything
Sure, sir
Sir, do you mind going
over to that side?
Why?
Am I in your way?
Do your job
Stand back and let me work
If I move away,
you'll fix that in no time, eh?
Why are you always on my case?
Who's always on your case?
You make all the fuss
If you don't know the job,
just say so
Who doesn't know the job?
You couldn't even tend a buffalo
How did you get this job?
Sir, please calm down
Is this any way to talk to a patient?
Is he a patient?
I know what a patient looks like?
Shut up and do your job
Are you the doctor?
Sir, calm down
Ask him to keep quiet
Sir, please
You finish the job
The spanner keeps slipping
I can't work with that
It's your job to check it all before
hand, isn't it?
I can't predict flat tyres
Call the office
Have them send another ambulance
There was an accident on the highway
All the ambulances are there
We can't do anything
I don't know what to do
How will we get there?
I'll go to the main road and
look for a garage
Come back quickly
Sir, please wait inside
the ambulance
Please, sir
'If you don't want to marry me,
why did you come and talk to my father?'
'My family has been good to you'
'Why are you dragging your heels?'
Sathya, is there a problem?
You've been fiddling with your phone
since this morning
This is a personal problem
I'll deal with it
Don't worry
Can I help you in some way?
Let me help
Mind your own business, sir
You mind your business by taking me
to the hospital first
Just stay calm till the driver
comes back, okay?
'If you get a message from my family,
that I'm serious'
'Don't worry, continue with your duty'
'You ditched me
Don't worry about me anymore'
(cell phone switched off)
Sir, what's happening?
Sir, are you alright?
Brother
Have you seen a tall man?
No
I am not your brother
I am Arumugham
Why are you crying?
Nothing
Just tell me
Nothing
What is the problem?
My boy friend told me to wait here
but till now he has not come
I am scared
Give me his phone number
I'll call him
I tried it's switched off
Don't know what to do
How does he look like?
He looks like you
Come on, I'll drop you off and go
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
Come, I'll drop you at your home
No need
Mind your own business
It's a sin to leave such a beautiful
girl in this lonely place
My conscience will ask me
Are you or are you not a man?
Check the vehicle
Ok, sir
Sir, there is an old man's
dead body inside
Open it
Hey
What happened?
What happened?
What happened, Aaru?
Who did this to you?
What happened?
Four thugs attacked me,
Stole my wallet and cell phone
Four guys?
Aren't you hurt?
No
Are you alright?
I am alright
Come on, let's go
I haven't repaired the vehicle yet
How can we go?
Come on, we'll find a way
The patient's condition is serious
Wear your slippers
Come
You go
Hurry up
Sir, the inspector is talking to you
Where have you been?
What is the problem?
We have a flat tyre
We went to the main road
to look for a garage
Is there a problem?
Couldn't you tell me
the vehicle had a flat tyre?
Why should I tell you?
Do I work for you?
He's the driver
Ask him
Just ignore him, sir
Do you have a spanner in your vehicle?
You drive an ambulance
Why don't you have the tools with you?
Give him the spanner
Sir, somebody stole my
wallet and cell phone
How many people?
A girl
A girl?
What were you doing when
she robbed you?
She was crying I was trying to help
But she tricked me
You work for emergency services
How can you be so stupid?
If you sees girls
nothing to remember
File a complaint at the police station
Let's see
Ok, sir
Tools
We have a thief with stomach pain
You need to have a look at him
What have you eaten?
No, I haven't eaten anything
I had a few drinks last night
For the time being,
a painkiller will do
It may be normal stomach pain
Better take him to a nearby hospital
Sir, if you are going to the hospital,
can you please take him too?
It'll take at least half an hour
to repair the vehicle
Kailasam sir, can you go along
with him to the hospital?
You want me to ride in
the police vehicle?
How dare you say that?
No one in my family has ever been
in a police vehicle
I called the ambulance,
not the police
What if this guy kills me on the way?
What is he blabbering about?
My son is a journalist
You know that?
So what?
Mind your tongue
What are you going to do?
Please calm dome
Hey, who does this guy think
he's talking to?
I don't need your help
You can go no w
Sorry, sir
Let's go
Old fart's lost his marbles
Sir, I'll bring the tools to
the police station
Don't bring that old man
Start the vehicle
Watch your step
How are you?
Fine
I didn't recognize you
I am Shreeja's mother
You saved my daughter
when she met with an accident
Yes, now I remember
How is your daughter?
She's fine
What are you here for?
I'm not well
I came for a check-up
Shall we get moving?
Bye
One moment
Please give me some candies
Why?
Come on
Give them to me
Tell your daughter these are from me
Sure
What's the problem here?
He vomited once, during the trip
I gave him Emicet and Pan
His ECG, normal sinus rhythm
BP is 160/90
I think it's fine for his age
Okay, fine
It's not fine
Why?
Who's the doctor here?
I am
Then you do the diagnosis
Okay
I've checked your medical records
They're fine
Did you come alone?
Yes
Why is there no one with you?
My son is really busy
Too busy to accompany his father?
He's a Journalist
Can you please raise your hand?
Can you please raise your right hand?
Higher, raise it higher
Up, up, higher
Raise it higher
Okay, lower it
You're okay
Nothing to worry about
You are fine
Be brave
I suggest you have a CT scan
We're not equipped for that here
You have to go to the city hospital
You have to go to the city hospital
Be brave
I'm not deaf, Doctor
What happened?
Accident on the highway
Let me have a look at him
Any other casualties in the accident?
The others are fine
Give him first aid
Take him carefully
Please wait here
I'll be back
Sathya, come
I've met this man before
and seen his files
He has chronic kidney
disease and diabetic
He's not taking
the medicines properly
He should be admitted to hospital
Inform his family as
soon as possible
His condition is serious
Take care of him
Hey, buddy!
What's with your girlfriend?
She has a real attitude problem
Why?
What happened?
You go and ask her
Where did you see her?
I saw her in the pharmacy
I'll be right back
So she avoided you
completely, did she?
Yes, sir
Who is Kavya?
She's Sathya's girlfriend
What's your business with her?
Are you in love with her?
Watch what you're saying
She's like a sister to me
I know you're in love with her
I can negotiate with Sathya for you
Shall I?
Yes, I like her,
but she loves him
What's the problem between them?
Tell me what the problem is?
Why do you want to know?
Tell me
If I don't tell you,
will your brain explode?
I won't tell you
Please tell me
Just tell me
His father-in-law asked him to quit
this job and join the family business
He's really angry
He and his girlfriend had a fight over this
This is more than enough
I'll make sure
you get her
Two minutes
I need to talk to her
Kavya, come with me
I want to talk to you
Kavya, come
What's your problem?
I came with my sister for
her check-up
I have to leave now
Why did you switch off your phone?
I came with my sister
for her check-up
I have to leave now
Why are you sending me
all the stupid text messages?
- I have to take my sister
- Stop it
Go...go with your sister
If you've made a decision,
please inform my father
- What is it?
- Stay back
- What?
- Go...go
Are you my friend?
What?
Are you listening to me?
What is it?
Don't believe anything
that man says
Sathya
Come here
- Let's go
- Where?
Doctor said I needed a scan, right?
Our job was just to bring you here
Ask your son to come
We'll update him, and leave
Call him
My son has gone abroad
He can't come
You said your son is a Journalist?
Why? Can't a journalist go abroad?
Okay, then please call someone else
We'll hand you over and go
My supervisor is angry
because we're late
Would you leave your own
father like this?
I'll lose my job
Please call someone to come
You'll grow old too
You'll end up like me
I don't trust him
You sacrificed your love
for your friend
I brought this money
and I trust you
If something happens to me
my only hope is you
But you want to leave too
That's okay, leave it
I want to give you some money
How much do you want?
Give me as much as you like
I don't need Sathya
Come with me
and take the cash
Till then,
shall I keep the money?
How can I trust you?
Okay, then take what you want
Okay
How many times have I
told you not to take bribes?
You have no pay
at least Rs.100
Why do you destroy the good
that comes my way?
Idiot! He's trying to manipulate you
He'll do anything
He seems like a good man
Thief...thief
He is taking away the money
Thief...thief
Catch him
Don't worry, sir
We'll find the thief
Just sign here
When you cheat someone
God will cheat you in a bigger way
I lost some money
and a cheap cell phone
But you lost fifty thousand rupees
From now on,
try to reform
Come on,
I'll drop you at the hospital
Don't worry
I'll manage
No problem
I'll drop you off
and then go
Where are you taking him?
We'll drop him off at
the hospital and go
Haven't you suffered enough?
If the supervisor asks,
what will you say?
I'll handle it
Don't worry about that
- Let's go
- Sathya
It's very lonely in
the back and boring
Why don't you sit
in the driver's seat?
I'll sit on the other side
What fun, we're going
on a sightseeing trip
You go and start the vehicle
You come, sir
Switch on the radio
That's not possible
It's a long way to go
It's boring
Let's have some music
No music when a
patient is on board
The doctor said I'm fine
We're only going to do a scan, right?
How many times do
I have to tell you?
(Music playing in the radio)
Why don't you listen
just one FM station?
"My desires never end"
"I am a river that
yearns for the rain"
"I am like the restless
waves upon the shores"
"The roads I travel never end"
"My desires never end"
"My voice never stops"
"My roads never end"
"They keep going on and on"
"My desires never end"
"I am a river that
yearns for the rain"
"My voice never stops"
"I am like the restless
waves upon the shores"
"I saw a wingless bird in the sky"
"I saw a moonlit night
without a moon, when I slept"
"My destiny is the road I take"
"Who can tell me where it leads"
"My desires never end"
"My voice never stops"
"The roads I travel never end"
"They keep going on and on"
"What we call the end
is not the end"
"End is a new beginning"
"All that turns to rubble
is not destroyed, "
"What is destroyed
can be created again, "
"Forgotten memories
and quests in vain"
"I'll be a wave in an ocean
with no shores"
Stop...stop!
Sir, one minute
What happened to him?
Take a deep breath
Keep breathing
Keep breathing
Stay still
Is that better?
Fold your hand
I'll hold it for you
Let go
Let me hold it
Let me help you
Let's go
Sit in the wheelchair
Why? What's wrong with me?
I'm perfectly all right
Will you listen to a friend?
Go on
Don't believe anything he says
He's planning to trick us
We should drop him off
and make our getaway
What do you say?
Idiot
You do what you want
What shall I tell the supervisor?
I'll see him in the office
tomorrow morning
Dr Prasanna from the local hospital
referred this patient
Chronic kidney disease
The doctor requested a CT scan
The patient has been
travelling since morning
He's in critical condition
Who are you?
Emergency medical technician (EMT)
Don't you know you're supposed
to greet the doctor?
Sorry, Doctor
Where's the patient?
He's waiting outside
Go on Bring him in
Yes, Doctor
He vomited once
I gave him Emicet and Pan
He was wheezing, so I gave him
one ampule of Deriphyllin
His BP and ECG
You're just an EMT, aren't you?
How many times
do I have to tell you?
Your duty ends here
Go on, we'll look after him
I'll be waiting outside
Lift your hand
Show me your tongue
Close your mouth
What's the problem?
I'm talking to you
That's what he was
trying to tell you
He didn't tell you how to
do your job, did he?
He's been with me since yesterday
He was trying to explain
what first aid he gave me
You should've listened to him
You're treating humans,
not animals, correct?
Don't you know how to
behave with patients?
Sister
Take this specimen to observation
The doctor who treats humans
will be here tomorrow
He'll treat you
What did the doctor say?
The doctor wants him
in for observation
Why didn't she start the treatment?
If you irritate the doctor,
this is what happens
Who started it?
Me or the doctor?
Please go, sister
What did you do?
This is not a good hospital
We'll look for another place
Why?
The doctor has no bedside
manner whatsoever
And you showed the doctor
your best behaviour, eh?
Go on in
Please go in, sir
Go inside
Who's staying with the patient?
I informed his son.
He's on his way.
Okay.
Don't think too much.
Just relax.
What happened, sir?
What's wrong?
We're going home, Sathya.
No, don't go
Go to your bed
and take some rest
Doctor will come
in the morning.
You can't leave
just like that.
- Let's go, Sathya
- What is this?
Do I look like a fool to you?
I'm not a servant.
I'm not your puppet.
I can't dance to your tune.
What did I do wrong?
I gave you extra care
But you keep taking
advantage of me.
I was wondering why nobody
came looking for you.
You're a psycho.
No one's coming to see a psycho.
Call your son immediately.
I want your son
to come immediately.
Everything you say
is a pack of lies.
Do you really have a son?
Or is that a lie too?
What's my relationship with you?
Call your son now...now.
I don't care if he comes or not.
I don't give a damn.
I'm leaving.
Do as you please.
Sir, what's your problem?
Do you know
how bad your condition is?
I knew it four years ago.
I need to be
admitted immediately.
The doctors said I only had
six months to live.
So I need to be
admitted immediately.
They'll see me
through to the end.
What kind of treatment is that?
To keep me in a hospital till I die.
Anyway, I knew I didn't
have much time.
I decided to live the way
I want to live.
Shall we go?
Why did you take me
out of the hospital?
Don't play games.
You're the one who insisted.
What are you saying now?
It's okay.
Forget it.
Where are we going next?
Please call your son.
Your money has been stolen.
If you die on my watch,
I'll be in trouble.
I'm sorry, sir.
Please call your son.
What happened?
I told you to stay in the hospital.
Let's go back to the hospital.
No, I don't want to go back.
Listen to me
If you're so scared of the hospital,
then why do you call the ambulance?
If I tell you,
you'll tear a strip off me.
Stop acting.
My village is very remote.
I get really bored.
When I'm really bored,
I call an ambulance...
...go out for a spin
and return home, that's all.
Sir, wait.
You go for a ride in an ambulance
when you feel bored, eh?
Hey, stop.
Don't you have a conscience?
So, Sathya.
What about your family?
My Mom is alive.
Yesterday was the first
anniversary of my dad's death.
Since my dad's death, my mom's
been living with my grandmother.
That's it.
Then what else?
What else?
That's it.
What about your girlfriend?
Who told you about her?
The ambulance driver.
It would be nice to hear
your love story while we travel.
There's nothing to tell.
That's it.
An old man is asking you.
Why can't you tell about it?
Mind your own business.
Switch on the radio.
- Stop the vehicle.
- Why?
I'm going to dance.
Would you care to join me?
Are you crazy?
I'm going to dance.
Stop the vehicle.
You're not supposed
to exert yourself.
(Song from radio)
I warned you several times.
Are you okay?
I'm Okay.
Shall we go back
to the hospital?
Let's go
- Go...!
- Listen to me, sir.
Go I say
Just leave me alone, go.
Leave me.
Come.
Sir.
We've reached your son's house.
Sir.
Sir?
Sir.
Sir.
Why are you doing this?
Come
Go and tell him
his dad is downstairs.
First floor, his name Kathiresan,
will be on the door...go on.
Can you talk like Sasikumar?
Mind your own business.
I like his acting a lot
Do one of his famous dialogues.
I am trying
to be a normal guy.
Don't irritate me.
Just one dialogue.
Who are you?
Sir, my name is Sathya.
Are you Kailasam's son?
Yes, that's me.
Yesterday we got a call saying
your dad had a heart attack.
So we picked him up
We got admitted him in the hospital
but he is not ready to stay-
- Is he dead?
- Sir...?
I'm asking if he's dead.
No, sir.
He's downstairs waiting for you.
He said you would come
down to see him.
Let me know when he's dead.
Then I'll come.
What?
Are you...
I don't know what the problem is
between you and your dad.
I didn't appreciate my own dad
when he was alive.
I feel badly that
I didn't take care of him.
This is not advice.
Sorry, sir.
(Mimics the famous dialogues)
You are exactly
like the star actor
You are right.
Your son's not there.
Only your daughter-in-law was there.
- I informed her
- Shall we go to VK puram?
- Yes.
- Wait.
It's too far.
- You can't go in this vehicle.
- That's not a problem.
Come here,
I have to talk to you.
That's not where you live.
Why do you want to go there?
That's where your girlfriend lives?
I've already told you not to
interfere in my personal matters.
You went and met
my son just now.
Isn't that my personal matter?
I went to see your son
because you asked me to.
You need help
fixing your love life?
Sathya, what are you going to say?
Why do you ask?
Suppose her father kicks you out?
Or if the girl says
she doesn't know you?
Don't expect things to happen
the way you want them to happen
Procrastinating won't help
Follow your instincts
and speak from your heart
Do you understand?
You of all people
are advising me?
Where are you?
I am nearby, sir
When will you be
coming to office?
- I'll be there in half an hour, sir
- Come immediately
Okay
The supervisor urgently wants to
see me, I think I'll see him first
You're not marrying
the supervisor, are you?
Shall I come?
I can handle it
I didn't come to console
or pamper you
You know my job, my character,
and how much I love my job
In the past five years,
I've never taken a single dime from you
I can't work in your
dad's store as his cashier
If we can have a better life
than we have now...
...why can't we go for that?
What's wrong in that?
He's my dad, isn't he?
Why do you have such an ego?
It's not about my ego
I'm satisfied with what I have
If you can live within my income,
then I'll welcome you
Otherwise marry someone
your father chooses
Nothing wrong with that
Don't spoil your life
just because you loved me
Be happy
"Journeys continue"
"The roads grow ever longer"
"I'm a bird who forgot
the route I used to travel"
"I am the curve
in which two poles meet"
"When I travel through the desert,
the oasis makes me glad"
"Nothing lasts forever"
"This will also pass"
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I work here
What are you doing here?
Sathya went to see the supervisor
I'm waiting for him
Sathya?
He still hasn't dropped you off?
What's your problem?
Can I ask you something?
Are you wicked or good?
I've had the same nagging
doubt myself
If you feel that I'm a good man,
That means I'm pretending
If you feel that I'm a bad man,
Then I'm not faking
I am what I am
So you decide
You be whatever you want to be
Leave me alone
What happened?
I've been suspended for a month
Suspended for a month?
Why?
What's wrong?
Everything went well yesterday
Is the supervisor harassing you?
Why did he suspend you?
Because
He was roaming around with you
You want an award for that?
I can talk to your supervisor
If you interfere,
he'll be fired permanently
I am furious with you
Come, sir,
let's go
I'll drop you at
your home and-
Why can't his highness go alone?
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go
What next?
Shall we go for a movie?
No time for
practical jokes, come on
I'll drop you at your house
What did my son say?
Sir?
You went and met my son
What did my son say?
Your son wasn't there
I spoke to your daughter-in-law
My daughter-in-law
passed away two years ago
What did my son say?
That guy is no father to me
He's not even a human being
I'll come and see him
after he's dead, is that it?
That's exactly what I told my father
My father told his
father the same thing
My son's old age
will be different
He wanted this to end with him
He decided not to have kids
Your medical records
I'm leaving
If you need anything, call me
Take care of your health
- See you
- Okay, sir
Sir
Take care of your health
Bye
Why are you following me?
Just because
Sir, you know his nature
Please go in and talk to him
I went to your house
Your son wasn't there
Where is he?
He comes, fights and leaves
Your son started the fight? eh?
Yes
My son shouldn't teach me, how to pee
I am his dad
How's your girlfriend?
She told me to stay away from you
She invited me to choose
our wedding invitation designs
I've had another heart attack
I'm on the way to the hospital
I'm on duty
I'll come and see you
at home this evening
What next?
"I don't even know what I want"
"I don't even know what I need"
"I am just looking, looking"
"I don't get anything"
"Somebody tell me where to stand"
"Somebody tell me where to stand"
'Listen, he is going to give a message'
"Then what?"
"Go straight and take left and turn right"
"There will be a tall pillar"
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"
'Help, help'
'Then what?'
"Go straight and take left and turn right"
"There will be a tall pillar"
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"
'Then what?'
'Well done'
'Listen carefully'
'Life is a tale, told by an idiot'
'Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'
"Go straight and take left and turn right"
"There will be a tall pillar"
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"
'Then what?'
'Then what?'
'Then what?'
I am a mistakenly born mistaker
I always makes mistakes
I never make yes takes
I thought you are going
to convey a message
Message?
