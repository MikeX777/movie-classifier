Leave and I'll put every man that's
bullet to the sword bloodthirsty isn't
he take the end stand guard
over the silver

prisoner thinking
 this escape is a disgrace to Rome
I want those prisoners yeah but how can
 they'll come home to

we will draw from the village tomorrow
and a fortnight we'll come back and
force zealots so
 their work in that case when we
come back I'll let Claudia indulge his
appetite we'll clean out
this nest of vipers.
 outside did
 Jorian pick it up I saw it in his
head I heard him say we'll clean out
this nest of vipers
then there's only one do strike
before he does he'll wait until morning
 Romans don't like working in the
dark wait longer than that he has enough
men to his move now.
Centurions no fool he's in no hurry but
sooner or later you'll take revenge for
this nice board then why wait we
outnumber the Romans
what's the matter lost
 nerve you're supposed to be our
leader to have no stomach
for doing anything
a pack of sheep threatened by wolves
and you want a new shepherd yeah alright
 first I've said you'd do
nothing I've said wait not because my
nerve was gone and my stomach was weak
but because I had an idea now listen
this morning while most of you in the
fields Nathan brought word of a certain
man in the north the Galilean was
gathering people around him
 follow him and already
calling the the Jews I had made
up go and seek this man where
he may be the Messiah we've all been
praying for it seems to me this might
accomplish more than killing a few.
Romans believe that until we find
a leader for the nation none of us will
be safe
none of us will be free on my way I
meant to spread the word of to
the country as I passed that I might
offer this man the strength of a nation
 I'd planned it's for you
to approve or disapprove I stay or I go
as you decide this sword belonged to a
man of name who fought long ago in
the army great warrior judas
maccabees
take it and offer it to the man of.
Galilee my allegiance goes with the
sword yeah
and to him accepted
everything's quiet yes too quiet
I notice you didn't come forward to lay
 oh why not because I
think you're going on a fool's errand
maybe you're right
the man's on a fool's errand from the
time he's born someday some man may
find what we're all looking for peace
happiness you believe
in what's going to happen I believe in
making it happen now
yes tonight and as a
result you brought danger on every man
woman and child in this village on
tomorrow why do you speak of her I
because I yeah now I remember always
always camera and asked
 follow that to the well
and evening I've loved her always as I
love now sure dad
what is eye here is it true
that you I've chosen to
be your I said I loved
her you will put this thought from your
mind this love from your heart that I
can't do if you could read my heart
you'd see but you can't all your noise
your books of the law speak to me so
 I know you could have me
stone for speaking like this but for
once let there be truth between us Joel
how can I give up a love that's as great
 Israel you look at me did
you see only what you want me to be not
what I am I shall beat you I'm not a
scholar patriot and I sell it you
you are a seller father hi no static
this you belong to that.
Park yup violence violence is the only
 Rome but it must be a nation's
violence what else can save us your
scrolls are dust cave
our law is alive with the breath of
Moses and Abraham and all the prophets
men our law called
 be the chosen of the Lord and
the Lord Himself came first into the
minds is
our law if there is just an outlaw it is
the desk of which the world was made
father I know you speak from your heart
 heart speaks too and I I don't
 you say Go Go we're
on a journey I planned he's going to
seek the Messiah some wonder-worker
Nathan told him about you you mean the
carpenter yes
you you're going seek Him he may be
the savior of our people if you go from
my house you will no longer my son
all my life I've Abed you without
question
 you're no longer and go Oh
before I forget these I loved and
cherished you go before I curse you
yes
take it
don't you realize what an excellent
match I've made for you.
 2,000 goals I'd have
given him three then you should rejoice
 betrothal now isn't every girl as
a father with brains enough to marry her
 huh no all right you
can go now
hm well what is it what is it what is it
Rachel said she heard the prisoners have
escaped escaped yeah
 be more trouble with this why do
you bring bad news into my house
I'm with you anywhere you
were weren't you
you said we'd leave the village to eat
some alone
 in great danger I must
get can but it's more than
that it's greater than the life of any
one village or any one of us what are
you saying I'm going in search of a man
who may the king that we need to lead
us an open war against Rome why it must
come if we're ever going to be anything
but slaves why must there be war why
must men fight
I don't care anything about king
 be your wife and bear
 all like please
take me with you I can't take
but it must I may never have the
courage journeys successful
there may be a chance new life for all
 this man is the Messiah and
this hope of freedom for Israel
If any man will come after me let him
deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me
who is this man before
 knew me
that's time he
spoke me.
 by my name and
I'm seeking I heard
he was near here you found him
no he was
called King of the Jews
this is he but where the multitudes that
 he came here to escape the
multitude then it is true he has many
followers they increased even as the
flocks of a Good Shepherd but he has
more the look of a poor pilgrim than a
king his power and greater than that of
any king my friend what sort of power
you mean he's a magician as some people
say laughs
I must speak with him not now
the destroy
men's lives to save them
 David have mercy on me
What wilt thou I should do unto
thee Lord that I may receive my sight
believe ye that I am able to J.
Lord receive thy sight
who thy way
thy faith hath me be
I am a witness you pause
 will use it to draw our
people together that we may smite our
enemies there's need for haste all the
country to the south is overrun by the.
Romans like me
 ready to join your forces.
Master we offer you our Allegiance and
our swords all they they take up the
sword shall perish with the sword
put it away my friend one man
who has no use for it.
 ready to
 he'll never take up arms.
I don't agree with feel as you do
that our master must soon draw the sword
come along with us you and I together
 twenty rule to
Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover
my village lies on that in why not
 man
where he certainly has great authority
he son of lamech the
scribe
I am called Judas
For what is a man profited if he shall
 whole world and lose his own
soul or what shall a man give in
 for his soul I say unto thee
arise and take up thy bed and go thy way
blessed are the poor in spirit for
 kingdom of heaven blessed
 for they shall be
comforted blessed are the meek for they
shall inherit the earth blessed are they
which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness for they shall be filled
blessed are the for they shall
obtain mercy the pure in
heart for they shall see God
blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness sake for the
 heaven blessed are the
- peacemakers for they shall be called the
- children of God
I'm convinced he'll never take up arms
unless he's forced to the right you know
there were certain men before you joined
us who tried to seize him and force him
to be king yes
what happened he sensed their purpose
and escaped men had
succeeded the history of Israel might
have been changed but they did not
succeed

going on

force his hand we can do it how Joel
he'll reach our village or
tomorrow I can't go to him because he
knows me but one of us you Laban will
approach him saying that your father
lies sick of a fever
for what purpose he never refuses the
sick where you lead him
you'll lead him the rest of you
away here and when he comes we'll seize
him and then together
with Judas and other of his disciples
who feel as I do that he should use his
 will proclaiming King you're sure
he's worthy to be our King I'm sure I've
seen his great works everywhere people
greet him as a his disciples
would die for him all that's needed is
-  to become a man of action it's a
- bold idea that appeals to me I say it's.
Worth trying

king in go to the marriage Day

Our village is honored by the visit of a
carpenter I asked

thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart and with all thy soul and
 and with all thy
mind and thy neighbor as thyself thou
hast answered write this do thou shalt
live and who is my neighbor a certain
man went down Jerusalem to Jericho
and fell among thieves which stripped
him of his and wounded him and
departed leaving him half dead and by
chance down a certain priest
that way and when he saw him he passed
by on the other side and likewise a.
Levite when came and
 other
side but a certain Samaritan as he
journeyed came he
 he had compassion on him and
went to him and bound up his wounds
 wine and set him on
 and brought him to an inn
and took care of him and on tomorrow
 took out two pence
and the host and said unto
 thou
spendest more when I come again I will
repay which now of these three thinkest
