If you leave me behind, I will die
The old man will kill me
Is this some wild story?
You can check for yourself
How he has burnt me with his cigars!
True, he has burnt you
in 3 different spots
Not just 3
Looks like you'll go
on a show-off spree!
Let me go

Did you scold my sister?
Promise, Charu
I told you already, I didn't
Sir, last week a girl's neck was slit,
just to rob her silver anklet
And she was thrown

You say your child is decked up
with gold chain, ring and all that
Dad?
She will be safe, we'll find her
Sir, will you-
Drive us to K.K Nagar?
Sir! Another U turn, huh?
Sir, speed up please

Why did you come to Chennai, brother?
An agency called me
to work as a driver abroad
But it didn't happen
Driver?
Then you are my clan
Did the agency cheat you

All belong to me
Your good name?
Christina
Wow! Nice name

I like to be
Awesome
I like to be with my friends
To enjoy life I don't mind
spending even a fortune
You know what?
Today is my birthday
Oh! Happy birthday
- Mr...?
-Vikram Vishwanath
You can call me Vicky
Actually I came here
To celebrate my birthday
with my friends
But I think after I met you
I should celebrate only with you
If I set my heart, I can do
anything for you in this world
Are you trying to hook up with me?
Yeah, of course
I want to
Christina, you haven't said anything
No way can you impress me
Why not?
- But I need some time
- Okay
One challenge
Between us?
What about a night drive?
I am going to Chennai
You can come with me
I will give you a few hours
But you can't impress me
I am 100% sure
I am game
'Minister's seaside bungalow
East Coast Road, Chennai'
Sir, you know very well
how to handle such cases
Madam, I have my own style of
solving even the toughest problem
But it won't work here
Now it's the minister's call
How did the News leak about
the boy's body in the railway track?
Our Army flat corruption
Gold mine corruption
He was the reporter who
publicized all our scams, sir
He is a real pain, sir
Keep a prompt reply ready
Did we get our hands dirty
in a routine rip-off?
If all this is brought to light,
not just me
All of you will be counting bars with me!
We sent our party men
to burn their huts
We denied strongly the News that
the girl's father committed suicide
If our link is leaked to the public...
...we can't run a Party
Only eat gruel in jail!
Elections are round the corner
Cover it up somehow
Leave this to me
(song from 'Payanangal Mudivadhillai')
I like this song very much
That too, I love the singer SPB
What a voice, sir!
Will you switch off the radio?
Sorry, sir
- Tell me
- 'Did you get the money?'
He said he doesn't have
'Did you refer my name?'
I did, no use
He gave me a 2 hour trip
to drive a customer instead
I'll get paid
So I took it up
Who the hell certified you as a driver?
Don't you know you can't
talk over the phone and drive?
Idiot! The word 'sorry'
is an easy way out
She won't even eat without me
- She'll be starving
- If we go home she'll come I'm sure
- Don't run, Charu
- I won't go home without Madhu
Hello, sir
What are you doing there?
Uncle! My sister is missing
Did you lodge a complaint?
Nothing to worry
I will take care
You will deal with it yourself?
It is a case of a missing person
Wait, I must interrogate you
- What is your name?
- Dileepan, sir
- Where do you work?
- I am a dubbing artiste
- What is your name, dear?
- Charumathi
- Your sister's name?
- Madhuvanthi
How old is she?
About 4 months old, sir
Then her mother must have taken her
Where is your mother, dear?
Mother...
Sorry, sir, my wife died 2 years ago
You're confusing me, baby
Do you have any photo?
Charu, why?
No need, don't show
She is just a child
She loves-
I thought as much right then
This was a whacko case
She is after all a kid, poor thing!
But shouldn't you know better?
So many out there come back
from work dog tired
Complaining about a missing dog!
Jobless or what?
Mr Police!
What?
Did you see a girl
without a sari go this way?
Without her sari?
Yes, she left behind this sari
and scooted with all my stuff
- Who?
- My wife Parvatham
- How old will she be?
- Nineteen
Why marry when you have
1 foot in your grave...
...and wander like a spirit?
Go back home
Look how diplomatically
he covers up his inadequacy
Is he a cop or a crook?
Brother, did you see her?
Oh! Sorry
I'm not blind and she escaped
from right under my nose!
How can you help me?
Let me continue my hunt
- Sir?
- What?
Be careful when you go that side
There's a hole in the middle of the road
Look who's talking!
Take your father home in 1 piece, baby
As if I have never seen a ditch!
He's a fine one to advise me!
Awww! I fell into the hole
I think his whole body
fell into the hole!
What are you looking
in the mirror for?
- Nothing in particular
- Look at that
- Vettu, shall I ride the bike?
- No need
You look very weak and you'll ride
at snail's pace, let me ride
Even this bro is cycling slowly
You mean to say he's weak?
- Let's ask his girl!
- Stop, 1 minute
Bloody pipsqueaks!
He looks weak to you?
Lay a finger on him
You will know his strength then!
- Take out your knife
- I left it behind at home
Hey! Come here
Why argue with them?
Why do you want
to buy trouble?
Coward! Shame on you!
You forgot about our loot?
Don't you have any self-worth?
Hen-pecked fellow!
Stop, I say
Hey, come
You're a scaredy-cat for sure
Police!
Let's scoot
Hurry up
Let's go, quick
Go...go
Hello, Ram Singh
Hey, Chandrababu
Long time!
How about some tips for me?
Thank you
'Welcome Chennai'
'You're listening to 91.1 FM
with RJ Abhinaya'
'Our rainbow-hued wishes on this
festive day to all listeners out there'
'You may be keen on exposing
your talent in our program'
'You'll be sharing plenty of
thrilling and chilling experiences'
'So our 'Little Thrill, Chillers Still'
is your heart-racing show'
'Let us talk to our 1st caller'
Tell me, madam
Why did you send for me?
Sir, if a boy ditches a girl...
...how will the people
from her caste react?
I've tried my best
to solve this issue
But will they keep quiet
if a person from their caste dies?
This is the reason for the riot, sir
This uprising was created by you
for your political gain
Everything was pre-planned
Your intelligence
Money and power
You've used your clout and changed
even the boy's postmortem report
To support this...
...I have video evidence of the people
involved in this, shot in a Spy Cam
All this was to protect
your position as minister, right?
Excuse me
Personal call
'Welcome, Radio City
This is your RJ Abhinaya'
'Muthukumar, you've registered for
'Little Thrill, Chillers Still' program
- 'Are you ready?'
- Oh yes! Moment I registered
'You can win a gold coin,
gift hamper or mobile'
- 'All the best for the 1st prize'
- I'll be happy with 3rd prize
I want that mobile-
'Good luck to get the mobile
which is the 3rd prize'
'What is your thrilling story?'
'Horror, Romance or is it Action?'
Subramani's story
In our village lived
a chap called Subramani
He had a younger sister
...mother and a friend
who had returned from abroad
One day that friend came
to our village on a leopard
- 'Leopard'?
- Jaguar car!
'For a second my heart stopped beating!'
He has passed only 3rd grade
and if he can drive a Jaguar...
...Subramani who graduated after
the 3rd attempt decided on that day
- 'What...?'
- He would also go abroad and earn
- Come to the same village on a horse
- 'On a horse?'?
I meant a Ferrari!
- 'Then?'
- Then what?
He left for Chennai
that very same night
He didn't go empty-handed
Then?
Helped himself to his mother's jewelry,
sister's cash and left home
'Story is superb'
'But there isn't any twist in your story'
His iPad has all the incriminating videos
Did he give it to you?
'He isn't even accepting it'
He will surrender
Is it money or girl?
Ask him what he wants
- 'He will agree'
- What if he doesn't...?
As if I have to give you ideas?
Okay, I'll try
'We enjoyed the story of
Subramani and his lost wallet'
Who's the next caller in line?
Mr Saravanan
If this News leaks...
...many people will be affected
I mean college reputation
Minister's future
Give me your 2nd option
An entire village is burning in agony
because of this problem, madam
For the girl's father's suicide
and the boy's death
...only you are responsible
Unaware of this truth...
...those innocent folks
are resorting to violence
Listen
If you don't like the minister's offer
you suggest an option
Don't go to the Press or Media instead
If you decide to go...
...if a bullet from my gun is missing
...I'm not answerable to anyone
Sir, have you gone mad or what?
He's a journalist, right?
If you point a gun at him...?
Why do you aggravate the problem?
Look, I came here
because you called me
If you threaten me by showing
your political clout and authority...
...I'm not the type to get scared
This meeting will also
turn into an evidence!
The number of innocent lives
you've sacrificed for your political votes
...I'll certainly publicize to the world
You reap what you sow!
If you represent the Press,
can you get away threatening us?
Hey! Come here
Throw him into the sea
Let him be a prey
at least to the fishes
- He's escaping!
- Nab him
Get him
Go fast, hurry
Follow him
Start the car
Sir, what happened?
Go to GV road
They are following our car
First take me to a safe place
- What are you looking for?
- My mobile
You can use mine, sir
Tell me the number
97
69
9795
Stop...!
Watch it
Follow him
Get him
Hey, come on
We'll catch him
I'm starving
Will you get 'biriyani'
from that eatery?
Bro, 1 'biriyani'
Hey! Pack up all the stuff
Isn't it getting late?
- You there! Pack up
- Almost done
What crap!
You heard madam?
Keep aside a leg piece
What about my clients who pay,
if they want a leg piece?
Your rule, huh?
I'll accuse you of child labor
- And put you behind bars
- This is for you, sir
You should be scared!
Hey you! Brown shirt
- Madam...?
- Come here
Who is she?
Husband and wife
Whose husband are you?
Whose wife is she?
We are going home after work
Pick up your food
and go home soon
- Thanks, madam
- Hey...!
Haven't you kept it aside?
Turn off the lights
Move...move
Greetings, madam
'We have been trying to reach Mr Muthukumar
but not succeeded as yet'
Ganesa, wash the plates
Bro...?
Did you see a girl go this way?
Girl...?
What is the matter?
She wanted me to help her
She had my bag and cycle
Now she's missing
You had money in the bag?
You look like someone
who works hard for his living
Now you've lost everything
She's probably an airplane party
That's why she flew away like a bird!
Let's go home, Charu
Charu, if you cry,
I'll feel like crying too
- Please, Charu
- All lies
My puppy is missing
and you're lying to me
Don't talk to me
Go away from here
Hey, Charu...?
Who is it?
- I'm Doraemon, your favorite hero
- Where are you?
You were crying, right?
That's why you can't see me
If you stop crying, I'll give you
whatever you ask for
Anything...?
Sure, anything
- Our pup Madhu?
- She is in my house
I came to invite your dad
for a function at home
Your dad was very busy
So I brought the puppy with me
Puppy is the chief guest!
After the function gets over...
...I'll drop puppy home
safe and sound
Is that okay?
You go home with your dad
Charu...?
I feel sorry for your dad
Don't feel sorry
He's a cheater!
Doraemon...?
Doraemon?
- Where did Doraemon go?
- You're lying
Even I saw
What's the time now, Charu?
- '11:30'
- Oh my God!
Is it so late in the night?
Doraemon's bedtime
Let's both go home
Tomorrow Doraemon will drop
our puppy back home, okay?
- Go
- Where to?
Charu, don't go by yourself
Will your friends be okay
about you coming with me?
Big deal!
If you are loaded
friends will make a bee line
You know one thing?
Money is not just
an evil necessity
It can even show you Heaven
Oh! What a crazy guy!
My God, look at that!
That's some style, I say
What's wrong with you?
Are you mad?
Hey Vicky
What's up with you?
Let's first wait
Why are you turning?
My gawd!
Vicky!
'He has ruined my business'
Where did you come from,
bloody demon?
Stinky scoundrel!
Is this how you drive?
Does this road
belong to your father?
Mind your words
I'm Vikram Vishwanath
I own Vikram group of companies
My dad can actually buy this road
if he wants to, scumbags!
Damn you, rich bugger!
- I'll kill you
- Sorry...sorry
- Vicky, calm down
- Why are you apologizing?
Madam, ask him to pay
for all the damages
Find out how much
How much?
On the whole
loss is more than 10,000
How much for everything?
Arrogant fellow!
Who are they, sir?
Why are they after you?
Where should I drop you?
Sir...?
Sir...?
Sir...!
- RKS Travels
- Bro...?
There's a problem, bro
What is it?
The client in my car is dead!
- What are you saying?
- Yes, bro
'Did I give you a mortuary van?'
'You have a dead body?'
'Car isn't damaged, right?'
The car-
'You had better bring the car back
without anyone noticing it'
Hello...?
'Muthukumar, welcome to the 2nd round
of 'Little Thrill, Chillers Still' program'
'Are you there?
Hello...?'
Can you hear me?
'Hello...hello? '
'Loving brother'
'Obedient son'
'And 'Sincere' Subramani who will not
travel ticketless to his home town'
'His story has entered
the 2nd round in this contest'
'Congratulations, boss!'
'So your friend Subramani took up
a job as driver to pay his fare'
'Continue his story'
'Don't put up your price
Share your story with our listeners'
If the passenger with you
a while ago was suddenly killed...
- 'What...?'
- What state will you be in?
'It will be as thrilling
as our show title, boss'
Now he is also sailing in the same boat
Come on...come on
Catch him
Come on, get in
Speed up
Hello...?
It's over, I'm on
my way back from Pondy
I'll call you once I reach there
Rishi...?
My battery is really low
Can I call you later?
Yeah, I'm travelling alone
Hey! Why did you lie?
I never said it's the truth
Liquor fuels romance, you know
Shall we try?
1 strong beer
Vodka with orange juice for you?
No...no, 1 vodka
Don't want it mixed?
Why...?
We'll click a selfie?
- Come, let's dance
- No, I'm not interested
What...?
Stay away
Thank you for the beer
"Lord of desire, Kama's breath breezed
scorching the wind as it teased"
"Sensual urges of desire
burst in my veins afire"
"When my fingertips caress you tonight
in raptures of deep delight"
"Without dawn breaking the sky above
tonight should lengthen, my love"
Baby, what are you doing here?
Is your puppy missing?
How will it help by sticking
a poster on a poster?
- Tomorrow they'll stick a new film poster
- Don't take it off
Will you come with me?
- Where to?
- I'll find your dog for you
'Subramani's passenger was killed'
'Muthukumar who shocked us
by sharing this is on the line'
'Then what happened to Subramani?'
What can I say, madam?
He's now caught in a situation
he never even dreamt of!
He's travelling with
a dead passenger he doesn't know
You rock, boss
Not knowing where to go
or what to do...
- I'm in a dilemma, madam
- Really...?
- Then...?
- Can I ask you something?
Sure, go ahead
If a person is in Subramani's shoes...
...will you help him?
Sure...we will
What I was narrating all along
was not Subramani's story, madam
'Then...?'
It is my story
What are you saying?
Please believe me, madam
Trust me
- Are you kidding?
- No, madam
Mr Muthukumar...?
What was that sound?
Hey! Come here
Bring that bag also
Where is your husband?
- He's your husband, right?
- Yes, madam
Where is he?
He has gone to buy 'biriyani' for me
What's in that bag?
Only old clothes, madam
Nothing else
Has he gone to Ambur to buy you 'biriyani'?
Gone to buy 'Ambur biriyani'
- Ouch!
- Runaway thief!
Will you die if you don't
watch TV just for a day?
Hey! How dare you
hit your wife in front of me
Yes, madam
He drinks, brings his mistress over
and beats me black and blue, madam
You got a mistress?
All that is crocodile tears, madam
Instead of cooking my dinner
she watches those soppy soaps on TV
Get up first
Stop crying and speak up
Gawd! Madam
He removed my wedding chain
And gifted it to
that other woman!
Drag him into our jeep
Come to the station
and file a complaint
I'll put him behind bars
in a dowry case
Don't do something drastic, madam
Even though now and then
he treats me badly...
...he genuinely loves our children
I'm not that bad, madam
Why are you changing
your tune all of a sudden?
Where do you live?
In Choolaimedu
Near Muniswaran temple
I'll drop you home
You get into the jeep
Get in
Come on
Sir, shall I get the bag?
He will find it heavy to carry
Give her the bag
'Radio city 91.1'
'In our ''Little Thrill, Chillers Still'
program tonight'
'Our caller is sharing his story
It's exciting at the same time thrilling'
'kumar from Tirunelveli'
'Until a while ago, he was narrating
the story of Subramani'
'Now he has given a sudden twist
by stating it is his own story'
'Judging by the noise around him
I feel it must be true'
'Shall we ask him
his present status?'
Mr Muthukumar, are you safe?
Hope there is no problem
'Oh! Good...good
Very good'
'Mr Muthukumar, how long
will you be on the run?'
'If you don't know
who is hounding you...'
...why don't you go to
the nearest police station?
'I am sure they will
help you, Mr Muthukumar'
'Dial 100, simple'
'Hello?'
'Mr Muthukumar
Are you there?'
'Hello...hello'
- Girl, at least is this your area?
- This is it, madam
Then why don't you get down?
Is it a temple procession?
My head is spinning, madam
You bet it will!
I've shown you the city at night
in my jeep, right?
Where is your house?
Madam, if we go straight
we will reach 2nd street
2nd house on the left
after a ditch, madam
Now you've made my head spin, girl
Hey! Come here
I realize now why
you're having an affair
- Such a crafty girl!
- Yes, madam
You are a fine one to agree!
Start leading a decent life
- What is your name?
- Chandrababu, madam
- Your name?
- Saroja Devi, madam
Wrong combination
If I ever see you both
roaming around at night...
...I'll give you 'knock knees' and
make you count bars, understood?
Yes, madam
Let's go, man
Give it to me, bloody thief
Think you're the commissioner?
I am not Brutus like you!
Look who's talking!!
Why did you tell her
we are married?
Think I'll marry such an ugly chap?
As if you'll get handsome hero Ajith?
- You bet he will
- Give it to me
- The old man who shot you will hound you
- As if you saw him shoot me!
Of course I saw him
Take this
Lock it up in a vault!
Sticker for your forehead
Hey girl! Wait
Give it to your fiancee
Stop, I say
You claimed he tied you up
How did you get these stickers?
That old man stuck it
on your forehead, huh?
If he had tried those tricks
he would have seen my nasty side
You're so spunky
How did you get caught?
As if I did!
'Kaja Beedi' got me into this mess
Who is that?
'Supposedly he drafted the perfect plan!'
Praise be to 'Bodyguard Deity'!
'I started as usual
with an invocation to God'
I'm back to stealing
after a long gap
Be merciful, dear Lord
Look at that!
Thief of hearts, Krsna!
Your antics are indeed a pleasure
'It was then I noticed'
Oh my goodness!
Thank you, my most favorite deity!
Am I offering you sweets?
Shut that mouth of yours!
Why didn't you leave after
stealing that entire loot?
'My bad time!'
That sounds like a funeral conch
Seems like a bad omen
'It was then I saw
the 'beedi' packet'
What the hell is this?
Cigar or cocaine?
Perfect sketch
Good job!
Is it Hotel Durbar Bhavan?
I'm calling from
Colonel Sethupathi's house
Please deliver 2 'masala dosa'
2 'sambar vada' and 2 cups coffee
2+2+2
A thief is here as my guest
He is tired after all the stealing
I've decided to honor him
Send it fast
I don't like to hunt
human beings, Mr Thief
I have kept hunting souvenirs here
Heads of lion, tiger, deer and kangaroo
I don't want to add your head
to my collection, Mr Thief
In addition to smoking 'beedis'...
...do you also use
snuff powder, Mr Thief?
You are sneezing
when I used the snuff, huh?!
Mr Thief, please come out of hiding
You can keep all the stolen items
Please don't harm me
Fine, you mixed cocaine in the cigars
Even in snuff powder, huh?
Bloody blind son of a gun!
Parvatham! You came back
to your beloved, huh?
Parvatham, my darling
What are you looking at?
Your beloved decking himself up, huh?
You died very young
That's why you are still so youthful
But having gone through the ups and downs
of life, I look slightly older than you
- What the hell do you want, man?
- To me?
Lip to lip kiss?
- Will you?
- Fat hopes!
I'll punch you on your nose
I'm not even your wife
and you dare ask to be kissed?
You used to say I don't
fulfill the duties of a husband!
Now you've changed your tune
and say you aren't my wife
You know something?
Tonight is our wedding night
You're saying it as
casually as 'good night'!
(song from 'Oli Vilakku')
"We are a couple newly married"
Do I deserve to be punished so harsh
for stepping in here to steal?
Call the police!
Let me surrender
- What now?
- I might cast an evil eye on your beauty!
God help me!
He is torturing me
Don't bring the roof down
People may accuse
your husband of being a lunatic
This has been my dream
for 30 long years
Let me buy a love-drug
and come back virile
Take the police for a royal ride
Don't spin your yarn with me
Bloody fool!
Give me the bag
Why should I?
I risked my life to steal
Just because you untied me and
offered a lift, I'll part with it, huh?
Get lost!
Hey! Stop
Sassy smartass!
How long will it take for me
to bash you and grab the bag?
I like that!
Try it
I dare you
I'll scream my throat hoarse
claiming you raped me
You think you can get away
with violence!
Hey stop
Drown in this water
- Hey! Vicky
- Get rid of your hangover
How can you drink till you puke?
They are all staring at you
You got me drunk and now
trying to clear my hangover?
Where did I keep it?
Did you see my purse?
No
Pccht! How did I misplace it?
Bloody drunkard!
Sir, pay us
I got to go
- Getting late for us
- I'm getting delayed too
I lost my wallet and my mobile
Don't bluff!
I own Vikram group of companies
Vikram Exports, Vikram Mills
Vikram Transports, the whole works
Baby, your dog will come back
wagging its tail however far it has gone
Take you father home carefully
- Okay, uncle
- See you
Thanks, uncle
Of late you are disobeying me a lot
You must go to school tomorrow
Charu, let's go home first
Give me my mobile
Let me call Jayabalan grandpa
and check if our pup-
Dad, our Madhu
Cha...Charu, that isn't our Madhu
Stay where you are
Wait for me
Where are you?
Charu...Charu?
Hold my hand, Charu
Charu, where are you going?
'Don't go there, Charu'
Charu, listen to me
Hello! Move to the kerb
Standing in the middle of the road!
- Move aside
- Sorry, sir
Go away!
"Waves in the sea search daily
edge of the shore tirelessly"
"Tears well up in the alcove of my eyes
as hours melt, still wandering helpless"
"A pup who showered
mother's love totally"
"Heaven blessed on
earth an angel for me"
"Even after my mother died
my friend, philosopher and guide"
"My pure white present
My petite crescent"
"Losing you, my face lost its glow"
"I searched for you high and low"
"My floral halo"
"Waves in the sea search daily
edge of the shore tirelessly"
"Tears well up in the alcove of my eyes
as hours melt, still wandering helpless"
Baby, whom are you looking for
at this time of night, huh?
My puppy
I know where it is
I'll show you, come
Get lost!
I'll thrash you
Let him go
I will take you
Come, baby
Trust me
Sorry, sir
Did you see a little girl here?
What? I don't understand
Where is my daughter?
You saw her here?
Right here, huh?
Charu...Charu?
Charu!
'Tell me, where are they?
Cough up the truth'
- Where are they?
- Sir
What?
Come inside
Sit down
Which area?
Yes, Ravi?
What is the case?
Sir, snatching case
Roughed up a college girl
- Which area?
- Pudhupettai boys
What happened to the girl?
She is in hospital
Critical condition
Then what about the other chap?
That chap was a temporary driver
He was on duty just for 3 hours
His passenger was murdered
He drove straight here,
with the dead body
I told you I'll be there soon
Trust me, I will
'Where are you now?'
Police statio-
No, railway station
'Doctor is saying
all kinds of stuff'
'I am scared
Come soon'
Okay, shall I hang up?
Who was on the phone?
Er...sister, sir
- Who are your family members?
- Sister and mother
Father is no more, sir
Hey Rathnam!
Let's go to the crime spot
Come with us
and show the spot
I must go to my hometown, sir
You can't budge an inch
You've come with a dead body
First show us the spot
Come along
If we get caught separately,
the police will loot us!
We are safe only if we walk
up to your place together
But 1 condition, don't try to
rub my back or smell my hair
No flirting
- Okay?
- As if I you'll let me
Wait here for a minute
Shall I hold the bag?
I can hold it
You just wait here
Hey! Don't peep
That old man bathed her
and decked her up!
What will I see
that he hasn't seen?
Akka, how could you
slap me so hard?
Hey! I will pickle you to pieces
Give the phone to my fiance
'She sounds furious
You talk to her'
Yes, sweety pie?
Are you mad at me?
How could you be scared
of the watchman, my dear?
He said he was a policeman!
You'll sketch a plan, that's it, huh?
You didn't land up on time
I somehow cajoled the chap
and brought him
All 3 of you messed it up
I told you, 'Bash him'
Why didn't you?
Now I am unable to get rid of him
He is planning to snatch our catch
Sweetie pie, what is your plan?
Who is with you?
Vettu, Noolu, Thulukkanam uncle and me
Got the knives ready?
Thulukkanam uncle did so long ago
I'll cleverly lure him
to Ekkaduthangal
When I reach the bridge, I'll ring
the cycle bell thrice as a signal
Knock him on his head
Close his chapter in a second
Okay? He might be eavesdropping now
I'll be there in ½ an hour
What is it, Babu?
You seem to be lost in thought
Wondering how to take
you home in 1 piece
1 piece for sure!
Come along
Where is my puppy, uncle?
Somewhere here
- Where, uncle?
- Found a case?
Sit down
Good girl, right?
You should do what I say, okay?
Sit down, sit here
He will bring the puppy
After he brings the puppy
we will all go meet your father
- Eat now
- Where is my puppy?
- We'll bring it, eat now
- I don't want
You must be hungry, eat
We will go once you have a bite
Give my bag
That's my dad's phone
- I'm not doing anything
- My dad is calling me
Give it to me
Hey! Go and make the child eat
This isn't your phone, baby
Mine, okay?
Hello?
No chance
What are you saying?
I won't accept that rate
Good piece, man
Discuss and call me back
Okay, I'll bring her
This phone is bugging me
- Hello!
- Charu?
Who is Charu?
'Who is this?'
Is Charu there?
No Charu here
- Hang up
- Who are you?
What happened, son?
I spoke to your father, baby
He is waiting for us
Wear this dress first
Then I will take you to your father
I won't wear that dress
Where is my puppy?
Hello?
Will I earn all through my life?
Only you will
I will be there in an hour
Keep the cash ready
Catch her
Hey! Come out
Sir is calling you
What, man?
You lost your wallet and so took up
a driver's job for a few hours
You claim you never knew him
Yes, sir
- Cigarette?
- I gave up
You reformed after
watching Mukesh's story, huh?
Very good
Did he tell you why and
who he was meeting?
No, sir
Did he contact anyone
after he was shot?
No, sir
He didn't tell you anything either
I've been saying this
from the beginning, sir
Why have you brought me here, sir?
What do you take me for?
Let's go
Sir, that man is dead
Should show some respect
(gun salute)
Will this salute do?
If you want me to respect a corpse
then why did you kill him?
- You think I killed him?
- You did
You killed him
You have to agree, otherwise
you can't move from here
Daddy...?
Cha!!
Go this way
Hey stop!
I said, 'stop'
Stop
I'll kill-
Sir, he isn't accepting
Who is he to accept?
I'll deal with him
Madam, the journalist is dead
- That iPad?
- Not with him now
- We will find it
- The driver?
- He is here
- Not just the iPad
That driver is a witness
Ensure there isn't any evidence, sir
I'll take care
Take him and search for the iPad
Go along with him
- It's here, sir
- What?
- Where?
- Here, sir
Come back
Get him
Let him go
As if he can escape!
This entire city is under my control
He will definitely get caught
This is going to be a long night
We just have to 'Stay Awake'
'After the break in Radio City'
'I am your RJ Luv-Guru'
Our program 'Little Thrill Chillers Still'
has become extremely exciting
'Listening to Muthukumar's story
our RJ Abhinaya fainted'
'We are unable to get Muthukumar on line,
as his number his switched off'
'If someone tore the last
few pages in a murder mystery...'
'...imagine the anti-climax'
'Muthukumar has created such a stir
and vanished into thin air'
'You may have a story even more
thrilling than what Muthukumar shared'
Sir, may I come in?
Come in
Sir, you wanted me to
discontinue this program?
- Have a seat
- Why did you stop me, sir?
Come on, Abhi
Due to certain unavoidable
circumstances I had no choice
Sir, please
Madam, what do you know?
He murdered his client and has escaped
Don't you know it is an offense
to aid a criminal?
What is the evidence?
That is none of your business
Of course it's my business
And sir, you stay out of it
Abhi, wait
He isn't the killer
Fine, he is innocent
How do we prove this?
Sir, please
Abhi, this is a serious situation here
No other option than
dropping him from this program
(song from 'Ninaippadhai Mudippavan')
- Sorry
- Who is that?
Want a ride?
Er...yes
Please wait
My bones are all aching
I'll just take my medication!
Okay
Where do you want to go?
Er...uh...my daughter is missing
She's a kid
Will you come, I must look
for her in a couple of places?
- Let's go
- Thanks
Where is your house?
We've been walking nonstop
Hey! I am asking you
Can't you see I am searching?
Your house or somebody else?
Only my house!
Selling salt to the sea, huh?
Trying to trick me of all people!
You poor thing! Came running
as soon as you saw me, huh?
Shall I take you home?
My sweetie-pie
My precious pet!
My little treasure
Sparkling diamond!
Dog looks cute, right?
Even I would like to
take it home with me
But I already have
a litter of pups
Inauspicious month!
Why risk it?
Will you get me wrong
if I say something?
What?
After my Myna...
...you are the only one
who has stolen my heart
I will keep this bell
as a souvenir of our meeting
You take the pup home
Stop playing this bell-game with me
Even from 100 feet any fool
can guess this is a diamond ring
Your tricks won't work with me
Find someone else
Chandrababu aspires
for Saroja Devi it seems!
Shit!
What the hell!
What bad timing
- What happened?
- How the hell do I know?
Listen! I have to
get there on time
- I need to be there
- I'll do something
- Give me your phone
- For what?
You have to sleep here
otherwise, is it okay?
Give me your phone
Bugging me with questions
Please do something fast
Wait...wait
Relax
Whom are you calling?
What happened now?
Phone is dead
Okay, come on
Give me your charger
Shit!
Wait, I'll just come
Where are you going?
To see Mukesh Ambani
Want to come?
Hey idiot!
Your car will also breakdown, moron
Yellow board scoundrel!
- 'Hello'
- Yes, Kalai
- 'Where are you now, brother?'
- I am on the way
'Why are you out of breath?'
Nothing serious
My friend met with an accident
'Whaaat?!
Accident?'
For my friend, not me
- 'Come soon, anna'
- I'll see you soon
- Hello?
- 'Muthukumar, I am Abhinaya'
Madam, is that you?
Yes, where are you now?
In the police station?
It's a miracle I am alive, madam
You told me to go to the police station
They are hand in glove with the culprits
I am aware, Muthukumar
Don't worry
I want to see you
Where are you?
Please! Don't chase me
I am the only male member in my family
'What happened?'
'Listen carefully!
I'm not chasing you'
'But the police officers are'
They are trying to frame this on you
'They want to make you the accused
and pin the murder on you'
I haven't done anything, madam
'But how will you prove it?'
'Press and Media will
publicize your photo'
There isn't a way out for you
'They are looking for something'
...which is with you or in the car
'Either they get it or
it has to reach the right person'
'Till then they will chase you'
You are a witness
So they might even kill you
'This is the crux of the matter'
Now try to redeem yourself
It's your call!
"The mighty few slaughter
the innocent ones who are weaker"
"Do the mighty kings think royally
they can rule over us eternally?"
"No longer will waiting help our cause
Wake up now o' Thamizha, support us"
"Waiting will make our dreams dissolve
O' son of our soil, now rise to resolve"
"Take to the sword that slays
so cruel acts of tyrants end; fear allays"
"Take to the sword that kills
so cruel acts come to a standstill"
"You are like a tiger living in the cave
O' Thamizha, rich values you have"
"No longer will waiting help our cause
Wake up now o' Thamizha, support us"
"I am a tiger in a cow's clothing"
"Under a cow's skin,
I am a tiger hiding"
"Shoulders you lift
Let your face be lit"

"Don't hesitate hereafter"
Hey! Police
Run...quick
Stop!
"Heart as joyful as the flower's hue"
In a way all of us are blind
I can't see beyond 500 feet
You can't see
at close quarters
Distance is the only difference
My son said he would
buy me an auto rickshaw
Why do I need one?
I'm happy with this
given by our MGR!
I refused to give it up
or sell this either
By the way, where did you say
you lost your child?
Don't worry
You'll find your child
Hey! Vicky
Where are you taking me?
"Peep through a magnifying glass sleazily"
"Look what job this lass is up to busily
peep through a magnifying glass sleazily"
Excuse me
I want to charge my mobile
Only 1 plug point is available
A mobile is already being charged
Please go, sir
"My sister's son is happy-go-lucky
Had a fling with a married Ms Turkey"
"Poor soul! Her husband is so sickly"
"Look what job this lady is up to busily"
What the hell, Vicky?
- Hold on
- What is your plan?
- Vicky!
- I am okay
Bro, your phone was being charged?
You came to charge your phone?
- What's that noise?
- Great timing, I swear
Your husband is coming
Help! Thief!!
A thief has entered my house
Bloody witch!
Got me caught after having fun!
He is running away
Come soon
- Let's run
- He is escaping
How many Good Samaritans will chase me!
I am not a thief
I am Vikram Vishwanath
I own Vikram group of companies
Most important to clarify
at this juncture
Hello!
Where are you exactly?
Near Alandur Aasife Briyani shop
'Come soon, I am scared'
Hide in a safe place
I'll give you instructions
- Yes, Abhi
- Uncle, where are you?
We traced his mobile signal
to the church in CK road
Radio jockey's mobile signal
is approaching in the same road
Hey! You there
Old man
Did you see a girl
in a school uniform?
Bloody ass! Stop
Stop right there
Where is the child?
- Let go of me
- Where is the child?
- I will bash you
- Try hitting me
He has kidnapped our child
- Scumbag, where is she?
- Take your hands off
Hey, where is my girl?
- Which girl?
- Where is Charu?
Give back my mobile
My daughter will call me
Take this watch instead
It is more expensive
than the mobile
- Costly, huh?
- Yes
What are you doing?
Let me go
- Let go of me
- Where is my child?
Where is my daughter?
What did you do to her?
- Let go, you scum
- Give my phone back
Can't you hear me?
Let go of me
Beat him to a pulp
Where is my daughter?
What did you do?
Smash his head
Bash him
Hey old man!
Setting him up to hit me?!
Wait, I'll get my boys
Go away, jobless jerk
You will get killed in an accident
Come on, son, he will die
in a road accident for sure
Let's go
We tracked his mobile signal
to this building, sir
I can see someone
run inside the church, sir
Yov! Switch on the light
Search over there
Traffic constable, what a surprise!
You don't have any work here
I saw your car while patrolling
So I came to see you
Came to see me?
Now that you have
you can leave
- Go
- Okay, sir
Sir, we searched
every nook and cranny
He isn't hiding here, sir
Let's go
(mobile ringtone)
What is the password?
I don't know, sir
He must have told you
Come in, God's messenger!
Sir, I know this boy
I need to interrogate him
Sir, I'll myself bring him in
for interrogation tomorrow
Are you teaching ME
rules of crime enquiry?
I know about the crime
as well as your enquiry mode
Please send him with me, sir
Come with me
Sir, that iPad...?
Are you mad? You don't
know how vicious he can be
Take the next bus back home
Sir, I went to all this trouble
only for the iPad
Bro, you left your bag behind?
Don't you want it?
Catch it
Doesn't matter if you don't
tell me the password
We can figure it out
But we can't let you go scot-free
Pandiya
Sir, don't commit this sin
You'll have to face the consequences
Lad, you go
We don't believe in sin and salvation
Hey rowdy
Take your gun
He shot one of our men
with his illegal gun
We witnessed the crime
When we own a licensed gun
how will we retaliate?
No sir!
Go
Pandiyan, search over there
Sir!
Sir, get up
Sir, get up
iPad...iPad
Will you keep talking on the phone
or make me also a heroine?
Yak yak on the phone
and mess up dialogs!
- Brother
- What?
- Name of the film?
- 'Vallavanukae Vallavan'
Who is the hero?
TR, now don't disturb us
- TR...?
- Did I hear him right?!
Leader of the women clan!

Hello, Mr Vikram Vishwanath
You must insert a coin
if you want to talk
Don't act smart
Give me a coin
Excuse me
Boss, I'm Vikram Vishwa-
Actually I need to make a call
If you can spare me a coin-
Your money, boss
Tomorrow I'll send it back
through my driver
- Thanks, boss, we are friends now
- No mention
Don't repeat, boss
1st time I'm seeing a rich man
begging from a tramp
- Hey, Karthik
- Who is it?
Hello, Karthik?
'Whose number is this?'
Hello...hello, Karthik?
Suchi, just check
Some unknown number
'Hey! It's Vicky'
'Karthik, can you hear me?'
Karthik, Vicky here
Can you hear me?
Bad luck...!
What happened?
She dances with no inhibitions at all
You acted pricey
for 1 single autograph!
Now I'm busy
Kind of suits me
- Saroja...?
- Huh...?
Do you have any idea of all this
you are decking yourself with?
Once a week I'll go
to steal only cosmetics
Why am I not surprised!
By the way, Saroja
Why don't you act in films?
With all this loot
you can become a celebrity
Then if you join
a political party of your caste
...you can become a politician
Then if you go up north...
...you can steal millions
You can settle down in life
I'll be eating gruel in Tihar jail
Don't be silly, Saroja
You think Tihar jail
is for petty thieves?
It's a different world
Different life
When you come out
you'll be covered in garlands
They will burst fireworks
and celebrate your freedom
Why are you looking at me dazed?
Someone who grazes donkeys...
...is so brainy
Otherwise can't manage you, right?
I agree that's quite a brainwave
I'll be the heroine
Who will be the hero?
I am the hero
He is the villain
What, man?
Do you think I won't shoot?
Parvatham...?
Please ask him to be
frightened of me
Chandrababu
He's holding the gun right, just run
He pushed me down, fool!
He's a drug addict
He'll shoot haphazardly
- Quick
- Come fast
If I keep calling your name
it will be a give away
So I'll come quietly and grab you
by the scruff of your collar
Why are you getting on to the truck?
I have a good reason, I'll tell you
Climb up
Give me the bag
Give it to me
Saroja, come up
I won't spare you
You have an union to lure
married women with expertise
Poor Tamil Nadu!
Wretched fellow
Hey, fraud...!
You married me
knowing I am old!
You never let me touch you
saying you'll lose your beauty
Beauty enhances
only by touch and kiss
Don't scream
Don't shout
I won't hurt you, please
Please
My dad won't go
anywhere without me
He cannot see, he is blind
I want to go back to my dad
Don't cry
Your father will be safe
I'm here for you
Sit down
Stay here, okay?
Sit down
You stay right here
I'll go and find your dad
Till then don't go anywhere
Sit here, I'll be back
- Madam, this is Muthukumar here
- 'What happened?'
- Can you help me?
- 'Sure, tell me'
'What should I do?'
What's this road block?
4 broken barrels are standing
in mid-road with their lids open!
Where are you taking
my boss's fiancee?
What do you say, bro?
Will you always turn up late, my dear?
He's your fiance?!
She is my wife Parvatham
How can you be her fiance?
Weapons...!
I'll take out my gun,
father of all these weapons
Hey...!
B...C...!!
That gun has no bullets
Get your knives
Good Lord! You said the gun
had no bullets, you lied?
See how I hit the bull's eye!
He shot the tyre
ATTAAAACK!
Aren't you fighting
for that damn bag?
Take the bag
and send the girl
Hey, who's this new guy in the race?
He isn't her boyfriend
He is our villain
What do think of yourself?
I've been a silent spectator
Are you my husband?
You look 25% like a bear!
Who are you?
His stooge, huh?
Why are you laughing?
You are 75% of a gorilla
Am I your wife?
I'll pickle you to pieces
What's tickling you?
What's so funny?
You throw the bag,
does it make you a hero?
- If I hit you
- Go back
I told you to plan a robbery and
you'll set me up for marriage!
Scoot
Clear out
Here's the bag
- What wedding mania!
- She escaped
'I am your Radio City Love-Guru
talking to you on this festive day'
'A little while ago one of our listeners
had updated about a missing child'
'That child is in her school uniform'
'She is in a red and white
checked pinafore and blouse'
'That girl's father is visually impaired'
'She is safe now...'
'...at Muniswaran temple
near Burma colony'
Please increase the volume
Sir, quiet
Let me listen
What happened, bro?
'We've also informed the police booth
Radio City team is heading there'
'The girl's father is visually impaired
and she is in her school uniform'
'We're aware of only these details'
'Radio City is trying to get
that child safely to her father'
That's my daughter
He is talking about Charu
- Yes, let's go check
- Do you know that place?
- Shouldn't spare them
- Wait, bro
Okay, sir
Over...!
How did you go in?
Ask the chap who must have
taken a bribe to open the subway
Ravi, check who is inside
No one here, sir
You know who the police
are looking for now
Wait
You there! Stop
Deaf or what?
Didn't I tell you to stop?
- What is in that bag?
- Nothing, bro
Take out the money
I have no money on me
- Take it out
- Sshhh! The police might hear
(overlap of angry voices)
There's nothing
- Give us your money
- Don't yell please
- Police
- We know that
Take off your shirt
Obey his order
What's in your pant pocket?
- Nothing
- Give it
Give us the bag
Bro, jackpot
There's an iPad
Give me the bag
That iPad is not mine
Please, bro
He has a gun
Toy gun, right?
Run...run
Run, bro
Come
See if he has grabbed
anything from him
I'm so tired, Vicky
I can't drive anymore
I've never been covered
even by a speck of dust
But today thanks to you,
I'm roaming on the road
...with worn out shoes
I'm pushing the car
That's life, Mr Vikram Vishwanath
If you want your dreams to come true...
...you should sacrifice a lot!
Yes, it's all my fate!
What an experience!
That too, on my birthday
Wonder what else
is in store for me!
Hey Vicky!
Vicky?
Hey...?
What are you doing?
I thought you'll run away with the bag
How can I abandon you?
Only after I get you home safe, I'll go
- Wow!
- I have my protocol even if I'm a thief
What concern!
At least now will you tell me
the right address?
Intend asking for my hand, huh?
Why not?
Without my puppy
I won't come home
You can go if you want
If they had not announced
over the radio, imagine your plight!
I can't even think about it
On top of it, you are
being so damn stubborn
I won't let go of you
You have to be with me all the time
Dad, did you hear that?
Madhu's bell?
Untie me, dad
- Madhu, dad
- No, Charu
Dad, I know
Our Madhu
Will you untie this?
Wait, I'll come with you
No need to untie this
I'll come along
Let's go together...Charu!
Stop...!
Charu...?
What did you do to my puppy?
You killed my pup and
threw it in the canal?
Baby, you might even accuse us
of being a kidnapper and killer
- Whom are you talking to?
- We are not so ruthless
Hear me out, sir
That puppy's collar
has my wedding ring
That's the only souvenir
of my wife we have
I would really appreciate it
if you return it
Here, keep the ring
Sir, but we don't know
where the puppy is
You can keep it
Where is our puppy?
We didn't harm
your puppy, baby
Take your child home safely, sir
Sir, please tell us
where our puppy is
- Let go, sir
- We don't know, sir
Please tell us and then go
(overlap of angry voices)
- Where did you find this collar?
- We found it on the road
Daddy...!
DAD!
Stop the vehicle!
Why did you ask me
to stop the car?
If scumbags rush across
they are bound to get hurt
How dare you say
something like that?
Reverse the car
Dad, nothing happened to you, right?
Charu, you're fine, right?
Take him to the hospital
Here's your cane, dad
Go to the hospital
- Charu?
- Sorry, sir
Let's go
That same fatso police
Hey! Soppy Soap viewer
Not yet gone home?
Aiyo! Bleeding profusely
Must rush him to the hospital
Get in, fast
Bro, please get in
- Bleeding heavily
- Drive fast, start
Start the car, Vicky
Let's go to the hospital
- No one is telling me anything
- Go fast
'I said, no need'
'Why keep asking me
if you'll pick me up?'
'Why should I be scared?'
I can take an auto
- Who is this?
- I'll be home soon
Parvatham...?
- Parvatham
- Pick me up, dear
Even if you keep changing your face,
my love for you will never change
I'll immediately ensure we have kids
and my lineage flourishes
I swear this on my mother
Turn left
Go, I say
Don't be scared
Drive carefully
Hey! Rascal
You dare point a gun at me!
Do you know who I am?
Smash his face
Let go of me
Scoundrel...!
Drag him in
Are you a big-time rowdy?
Give me the bag
I'll shoot you
Listen to me, I didn't
do anything wrong
Yov! He's lying
- Shoot him
- If I shoot, your brain will scatter
Shoot, I say
Pull the trigger
Let go
Shoot...!
There are no bullets in that
Hear me out now
Please allow me to talk
Listen to me
Please
My mother means the world to me
Just because some stranger
pick-pocketed my wallet
...I'm on the run now
Brother
Don't worry, your mother
and sister will be fine
You thought of helping
a helpless child
I'm sure you are innocent
To ensure you reach
your hometown
...we'll do whatever help we can
- Madam, tell me
- Did you nab him?
Will you get him before dawn?
Madam, this involves
my prestige too
Minister is on the other line
Speak to him
What is the problem?
You want this News to leak
and for me to go behind bars!
What are you saying?
Sir, he's somewhere around this place
But so damn evasive
Someone is helping him
Shut up, useless son of a gun!
Don't make me cuss you
Listen
Before sunrise, I don't want
any eyewitness to be alive
Even if it is a mongrel
on the street shoot it down!
Do you get it?
Okay, sir
None of them will be alive
I'll take care
I am responsible for all these events
But it wasn't intentional, right?
Let's try one last time, Vicky
It's impossible!
Without the password no chance
Let's get out of here
All we can do is reset it
But if we reset,
data will get erased
- Sorry
- Brother...?
You said you know
that RJ's phone number?
Why don't you try talking to her?
- Hello...?
- Madam, this is Muthukumar
Tell me
'In a Govt sealed Theme park
on the Bangalore highway'
You wait there
- I'll come
- Make it quick, madam
If you take the iPad, madam
I can go back to my hometown
Madam...hello...?
Brother...?
Any problem?
What happened?
If you stay with me,
you'll be in danger
Police will get here soon
Please go away
We have a PhD in tackling them!
Not only with money, Vicky
You can impress people
with a helping nature also
I somehow want to help you but...
I don't know what to do
But I'm always with you, brother
Hello boss
You don't have to worry
We'll handle whoever comes
I'm Vikram Vishwanath
I own Vikram group
of companies, okay?
Sir, is this the time
to get introduced?
Given a chance you will
stick out your visiting card!
Sir, I hear a siren
Sir, police
Come on, rush
Never thought
they'll come so soon
Where's Charu?
(Islamic prayer)
Aiyaiyo! It is locked
Let's climb up
Climb one by one
Hurry up
- How many on the whole?
- About 6 or 7, sir
- Kill all of them
- Okay, sir
Shoot at sight!
I don't want them alive, GO!
What will we do sitting here?
Let's see if there
is any escape route
Sit tight here
- Let me come, brother
- Dad, don't go
Sit here
Let us find out
Are you okay?
- Daddy!!
- Charu, where were you?
Dad...go to your left
Right...right
Dad, that's aunty
Me, sir...don't shoot me
- Throw
- Catch it
Dad
Come this way
Watch your step
Climb up
Dad
Come
Daddy
Dad!
Is anyone hurt?
Give me your hand
There is a hole
Seems to be a way out
Is there a passage?
Go, sir
- I'll go, you follow
- Get in, man
Hurry up
They will spot you
Come down fast
You'll be in trouble
if you're with me
I told you we can
face it together
Don't argue
Please go
'Hey listen
Come with us'
'Are you mad?'
You had better surrender
You can't escape
You've killed a journalist
And a police officer
Fire!
This is for you
Yasodara
Buddha's wife
Your wallet and charger
Mr Vikram
Son of Vishwanath
I wanted you to forget
your pompous image
And see the real world
through different eyes
That's all
Sorry
Christina
Thanks for everything
I am not Christina
Cheater! Where did you gallivant?
Dileepa, I told you so, right?
Did you believe me?
What we love will always come back
to us, life is a full circle
Bring your daughter in
Okay
No loss is temporary
Come inside
Drink this
Muthukumar would have survived?
Let's hope he is alive
What else can we do?
This is your share
as per our deal
I don't want it
Keep it for yourself
What's up with you?
I can't reform
like the speed of lightning
Look at my next plan
Want to join?
50-50!
Instead of blabbering
about sin and salvation...
...take your share and
go back safe and sound
Hey! Madhu?
Where did you vanish?
I was so worried
you had left me
I searched for you everywhere
'All the details
are in the iPad'
'Many people will be affected
if this News leaks out'
'I mean college reputation'
'Minister's future'
'Give me your 2nd option'
'Based on the evidence in an iPad
submitted by Mr Dileepan from KK Nagar'
'...to the Commissioner'
'Police officer Nagendra Babu'
'Minister Ramamurthy'
'And Vijayalakshmi, registrar of college
have been arrested immediately'
'In this connection, Radio Jockey
Abhinaya who has 1st hand information'
'...is meeting the Press and Media now'
Muthukumar was an innocent soul
Just because he witnessed the murders
of a journalist and policeman...
'...he has been subjected
to all these atrocities'
The guilty even if they hold
high positions and have immense clout
...they should be punished without fail
Now truth has won
Sorry
We will use Muthukumar's body
as a trump card, call the people
Lead an intellectual movement
'A police officer on duty
has been shot dead'
'Sudden disappearance of a journalist
investigating a case of honor killing'
'Mr Muthukumar who drove Mr Saravanan
was murdered in a fake encounter'
'These deaths have created a stir amongst
the public and Human Rights activists'
Look here, I am letting you in
because my colleague insisted
Police case
Come out soon
Hello?
'Brother, have you reached?'
'Where are you now?'
'Mother is asking for you repeatedly'
'Hello! Why aren't you
saying anything?'
'Anna?'
'Are you there, brother?'
This is your brother speaking!
I will be there very soon
'As long as we don't help or
harm anyone, he is a stranger to us'
'If we do either of these 2 acts
he becomes a part of our life'
