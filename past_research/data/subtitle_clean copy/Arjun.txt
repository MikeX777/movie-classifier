I wiII cut to pieces
whoever obstructs my path.
I wiII fight even if I need to die.
I swear on this bIood-stained sword.
''May it so happen''
''May the oceans be crossed''
''May the sky be reached''
''May it so happen''
''One word, one arrow and one aim.''
''Everything shatters
at a singIe Iook.''
''Even a singIe person who
cannot be defeated is enough.''
''If there is a wiII, there
is a way to Mars, Iet's go.''
''Come, Iet's go.''
''May it so happen''
''Let's bring the stars.''
''The boundaries are ours. Let's go.''
''Get on the
wing-horse and ruIe the sky.''
''The future is
weIcoming you with open arms.''
''We wiII conquer everything.''
''WaIk with courage.''
''We wiII conquer everything.''
''The earthquakes are
possibIe even in the sky.''
''Everything is possibIe for you.''
''Come, Iet's go.''
''Bring the fIowing
Ganges to cunning Krishna.''
''Not onIy rivers, but aIso
bring the hearts together.''
''Life is about winning friends.''
''We wiII win everyone.''
''The youth means the most
wonderfuI thing on earth.''
''We wiII win everyone.''
''Fast and unity both
of possibIe for you.''
''Everything is possibIe for you.''
''And worship eIders.''
''Come, Iet's go.''
''One word, one arrow and one aim.''
''Everything shatters
at a singIe Iook.''
''Even a singIe person who
is undefeatabIe is enough.''
''If there is a wiII, there
is a way to Mars, Iet's go.''
''Come, Iet's go.''
When there is a wiII,
there is a way even to mars.
And when there is wiII, we
feeI Iike we can do anything.
WaIking on the moon
isn't the onIy great thing.
Fighting against
injustice is aIso a great thing.
Right now my
destination aIso a simiIar one.
KamaIa, keep the water
on the stove for my bath.
Yes, I am keeping it.
I woke up so earIy..
..but stiII I am getting Iate.
It's aIready 9 O' cIock.
Mother, have you fiIIed

KamaIa, is the Tiffin ready?
- Yes.
KamaIa, bring one more Dosa.
- Yes, I am coming.
Hey, move aside.
- You get aside.
Get aside.

Are you going to
Tank Bunk or to coIIege?
You need to write exams weII,

I am not Iike you, I have

I mean I have aIready
revised the whoIe portion.
Wait for a moment, and then
hang this mirror in your neck.
Get aside.
- That's what I am teIIing you.
Get aside.
- You get aside first.
What's there in your
face to see so Iong!
What isn't there in my face,
you teII me first?
The moustache.
- You are absoIuteIy right.
You demon !
- Mother.
You wiII faiI in aII the subjects.
It suits your face.
- You started it again?
Your head shouId be tonsured.
- Both of you didn't fight onIy..
..when you were my womb together.
But since you came..
..out I never saw you
without fighting even for a second.
Like parents Iike chiIdren.
- Father, Iook at him.
He doesn't know how to
respect eIders. - Who is eIder?
Just now mother confirmed it
that we both we born at once.
Yes, dear. We were
both simuItaneousIy..
..but who came out of
mother's womb first? It's me.
That means technicaIIy I am
eIder than you by ten minutes.
So you are my younger brother.
What's this, mother! You
couId have sent me out first.
Anyway, how can I expect
a Iady to support a boy!
That's why they say, Iadies first.
- Correct.
Father might have aIso said
the same thing whiIe deIivery.
Get Iost.
- And I Iet you go first.
Right. - But I am the taIIer
than you. So I am eIder than you.
Meenakshi, won't you worship
God. You are getting Iate.
God, with your grace I have writt
en aII the exams weII.
Now pIease have mercy on me and..
..Iet aII the question that I
have studied be there in paper.
Gob, pIease grand me

O God.
Father, come here.
- What?
''HaiI Lord Ganapati!''
Is Lord Ganapati drinking miIk?
Devotees, don't Ieave
everything up to me with..
..superstition and have some
faith in your wiII-power too.
It wiII be good for you.
- Demon. - God, save me.
What a wonder! What a wonder!
The room is fiIIed..
..Iike a one-day
internationaI cricket stadium.
What an attention ! What an
attention ! - It's not attention..
..sir, but its tension.
Give us the paper fast.
We too feIt the same way,
when we were giving..
..Iectures in the
empty cIasses. Sit down.
One wicket is down.
Hey, take her to paviIion.
Hey, do you know any answer.
- Do you know any answer?
Do you know any answer?
- Do you know any answer?
I know the answer.
ShaII I write the answer?

my face! Start writing.
You revised the whoIe portion,
didn't you? Now write.
Mind your own business!
My God! What a shock!
Now I knew how you got

I didn't bring the sIips, sir.
- Then did you bring the guide?
Thank you.
Are the answers
written on the board?
Sir, I have squint-eyes.
- I see. Then write it that way.
Haven't you read anything?
You're good at..
..teIIing stories though.
The time is about to end.
StiII there is a Iot of time.
Anyway, I wiII start it.
Give me you pen.
- What for?
PeopIe write exams with pens,

Sir.

So fast?
- Not three hours, but haIf an hour.
Very nice boy.

A sateIIite receiver

What shaII we do, boss? TeII us.
Your friends' answers sheets

What's that?
Security, come here.
So you were copying with
the heIp of high-tech.
How did you write?

Fine.

Meena, I want to taIk

These four years

Fast? What are you saying! I feeI
Iike it took decades.
From today we are

So I too want to taIk to you today.
But I am wondering what

..fIoors' baIcony. And our
engineers have reported..
..that you have aIso used
a cheap cement for that.
So, forget about the seventh fIoor..
..and first do something

Hey, do you know whom you

Hey, how dare you to
taIk Iike that with madam!
How dare you !

Let's come to settIement.
HeIIo, Mr. Commissioner,

After aII it is just a sign.
Ok, Mr. GopaI, Iet's make a deaI.

They suppIy tea to our office aIso.
Now I Iiked you,
madam. I know the saIary..
..that the government gives you,
isn't sufficient for you.
You too have sons how
study and daughters..
..who are about to
get married, don't you?
Take this, madam.
There are fifty
thousand rupees in this.
WeII, he is my son. As
you said, he is studying.
GeneraIIy he takes
care of aII these things.
You taIk to him and
come to a settIement, ok?
I have a Iot of work to
do in office. Goodbye, ok?
I heard that Paya of
this hoteI is very tasty.
Why don't you show the taste of it?
Brother Akbar, come here.
CIose the service for today.
There is fifty thousand in that.
Repair the damages after a whiIe.
Take it, brother.
Show him the taste of the Paya.
What?
How is the Paya?
It's fine.
With this, our prestige has
increased tenfoId in our office.
Everyone is greeting us from
the poem to the commissioner.
Because of our the
Ioads of work in office..
..we missed the Iive-action.
But do teII us the next time..
..you bash someone. We wiII watch.
- Oh !
Other parents scoId their kids
when they invoIve in a fight..
..but you are encouraging him.
Are you his reaIIy his parents?
Are you reaIIy our daughter?
There shouId be son Iike him..
..in every house, or eIse it'd
be difficuIt. - You are right.
So you want to make him a rowdy?
This chapter won't end here.
WiII that rowdy do nothing?
He wiII come with some more goons.
So what? He wiII aIso
take some men with him.
And if that is not sufficient,
we wiII aIso join him.
O God! You onIy can save them.
We don't Ieave
everything on God Iike you.
We do what we can. Father, if
we Iive with this B.C. girI..
..then we too wiII
become oId-fashioned Iike her.
So find a boy for her urgentIy
and send her out of this house.
And we shaII go forward
in this fast-generation.
Hey, even though you are youngest..
..you understand our
responsibiIities very weII.
Anyway, since her
finaI exams are over..
..we shaII find a suitabIe
boy and get her married.
You are right.
- Wow! She is feeIing shy.
''Our Meenakshi wiII become a bride.''
Stop.
- Why did you shout Iike that!
Are you about to give us a shock?
Get me married fast, so
that I couId get rid of him.
She too showed the green-signaI.
We shaII contact some
marriage-bureau fast.
It's not that good to depend
on these bureaus and things.
It better to find a suitabIe
among known to our famiIy.
It wouId have been so great,
if my sister was here..
..to Iook after aII these things.
- Is she dead?
What rubbish are you taIking!
- Or what eIse shouId I say!
Have you written your sister
even a singIe Ietter recentIy?
Have you at Ieast tried
to know her weII-being?
No, when I Iast heard about her..
..there was some
drought in her viIIage.
Even she didn't write about it.
KamaIa, when did we receive
the Iast Ietter from my sister?
See, if the new
address is written in it.
Check these.
I guess this is the Iast Ietter.
Mother, it seems that
you didn't even open this.
What? It isn't open? Give it to me.
This seems to be my
sister's handwriting.
It is in fact. You don't
even have the time in this..
..fast generation to read a
Ietter that came an year ago.
I am fine and hope you are
aIso fine aIong with your kids.
Since your
brother-in-Iaw passed away..
..my heath is deteriorating.
And there is a drought..
..in our viIIage. I
prayed aII the Gods for rain.
Even the cattIe's condition is
not weII due to the shortage..
..of food. Everyone is
Ieaving the viIIage.
I am aIso thinking of
going to another viIIage.
ActuaIIy I have some
shortage of money.
If possibIe pIease send
me two thousand rupees.
I am asking you money, since I
don't want to seII our Iand..
..which is the onIy thing
that our parents Ieft for us.
I wiII be waiting for you repIy.
Your sister, Parvati.
What's this, father! So
this is a fast generation..
..where one doesn't
even care of one's sister.
As Meenakshi said, it's
better if we go back to B.C. days.
HeIIo. Tomorrow you wiII
aIso become Iike that.
Today you may care for me..
..but after my marriage
you wiII aIso forget me.
You wiII aIways be thinking
about your wife, your kids..
..your property, your issues..
- Ok, now stop it.
Father, if we want to
get her married soon..
..then as you said your
sister can Iook for a good match..
..for her, so I wiII go and
bring her wherever she is.
ReaIIy? - Yes, I wiII bring
her here to send you out of here.
HaiI Goddess Meenakshi of Madhurai.
HaiI Goddess Kamakshi of Kanchi.
HaiI Goddess VishaIakshi of Kashi.
HeIIo, where is
Kavuri Parvatamma's house?
Her house is behind the
Rama tempIe in that Iane.
Brother.
I am not your brother,
aunty. I am your brother's son.
I can see my brother in you.
I hope you didn't forget us.
From now onwards you wiII
stay with your brother onIy.
Now get ready.
- Am I am the one who forgot you..
..or it's your father got forgot me?
Aunty, actuaIIy your
brother is aIso regretting this.
You may not know
about the government job.
He is aIso busy with since your
brother is a sincere officer..
..and your sister-in-Iaw is
aIso a government empIoyee.
Both are very busy peopIe.
And we are busy with our..
..studies and our entire home
is aIways busy. And I guess..
..there is no need to teII
you about our confusing city.
I came here to eradicate the
word 'busy', between sibIings.
You are my dear aunty, aren't you?
So forget
everything and come with me.
Aunty, why are you stiII
taking these oId medicines when..
..your brother wants to get
you treated in a big hospitaI.
You get ready fast. - You need
not to get bothered about me.
You peopIe Iive there in
you busy city happiIy.
What's this! Why am I taking to you?
How can't you taIk to me, aunty?
A girI is
affectionate towards her mother.
And a boy is
affectionate towards her aunty.
I don't a daughter for you.
- It wouId have been so great..
..if you had a daughter, I
wouId have married her and Iived..
..her aIong with you.
Trust me aunty,
there is a very narrow..
..Iine between you sibIings.
And since you are eIdest..
..in our famiIy, so your
brother wants you to find..
..a good match for Meenakshi.
How eIse can do aII these..
..things for us other than you !
- You are Iooking matches..
..for Meenakshi?
- Aunty, we haven't started it.
Your brother you to
see a good match for her.
Then, there is a suitabIe match fo
r her in BoorugapaIIi famiIy.
Which BoorugapaIIi famiIy?
- The boy is aIso weII-educated.
They Iive in IndravaIIi.
- Then shaII we go to Hyderabad?
Who eIse wiII Iook a match
for my brother's daughter..
..other than me?
- ShaII I bring the car?
Wait a moment, eat something first.
I wiII eat Iater,
aunty. You first get ready.
Aunty, you get on the car first.
I wiII bring the Iuggage.
It anything needs to be done here..
..then father wiII come
and do it. Ok? Let's go.
Goodbye.
- Happy journey.
Savitramma, I am going.
- Wish you a happy journey.
Mr. Raghavaiyya, goodbye.
- Take care of your heaIth.
AII of you must come
to marriage, ok? - Ok.
Get aside, aunty.
Aunty. Aunty.
What happened, Parvatamma?
Parvatamma.
O no, what couId this
mishap happen ! - What happened?
RamuIu. Veerayya.
Parvatamma passed away.
- O no.
AII these days she was waiting
for his brother. And when his..
..brother sent his
son to bring her,..
..she passed away.
It's so unfortunate.
No eIse is there among our
sibIings, other than me.
Even though aII of you are with me..
..but I stiII feeI Iike I
have become very IoneIy.
I've seen the same emotions
in your sister's eyes too.
The onIy difference is
that you are feeIing IoneIy..
..after her death and
she was feeIing IoneIy..
..even when aII of us were there.
It's very unfortunate
that no one were near her..
..when she passed away.
'I wish even our enemies
shouIdn't face such a day.'
'I feIt Iike father
did a big mistake.'
'Even if we are Iiving
in a mechanicaI Iife..'
'..it's a big sin to
ignore our sibIings.'
'The Iast day with my
aunt made me reaIize this.'
Don't be naughty.
Don't gaze everywhere.
And get on the train as soon
as it stops on the pIatform.
The train doesn't stop on
this pIatform for too Iong.
Don't get down to
fiII the water bottIe..
So fiII the water bottIe forehand.
Now get up, you useIess feIIow!
If there is a man in
the Iadies compartment..
..then go and compIaint to the TT.
This is not Iike our city.
This city is fuII of rouges.
I brought you here to
write an entrance exam..
..it is a good course. Even our
tickets are aIso to be bIamed.
We are in the first coach and
you are in the second coach.
Mr. Rao, they are not kids. AII
our girIs are together.
ReaIIy, useIess feIIow.
You shouIdn't behave
according to you wish.
You must do whatever I said, or
eIse I'II kiII you. Last time..
..too I toId you many things,
but you didn't Iisten to me.
If you don't Iisten to me again,
I'II definiteIy kiII you this time.
Why are you standing Iike that!
Did you get me or not?
And don't get down on every station.
And don't buy aII the junk food.
I wiII be waiting
for you on our station.
GirIs, there is no one to
stop us for three hours.
HeIIo, how much is this
appIe's cost? - Ten rupees.
What's the cost of this one?
- And this smaII one?
This is aIso of same cost?
- AII are of same price, girI.
Hey, girIs. It's ok. Come.
- Come on.
Hey, these fIowers are so nice!
- Yah, that's so beautifuI, no?
Give these roses.
- Yah ! They are reaIIy cute.
Buy something for yourseIf.
This one. Hey, how is this
one? It's nice, isn't it?
This is so nice.
Look, there's a boy on the
bike in green checks-shirt.
Don't Iook aII of a sudden.
- Ok. Ok.
Look at him casuaIIy.
How does he Iook? How does he Iook?
Wow! He Iooks Iike a prince.
He might Iook Iike that
right now, but after some time..
..he wiII become go mad.
You can't afford her, but
the nose-ring is reaIIy great.
You can't buy it since you
are not my eIder brother.
I think I shouId buy
something for you since I am eIder.
He might not know that we
are from a different city.
When we wiII come
Hyderabad next time..
He wiII grow his bread
and Iook Iike a Devdas.
Hey, Rupa, Iook there.
''Let's pIay hide and seek.''
''Hide and seek: TeII
me who the thief is.''
''Let's pIay hide and seek.''
''Hide and seek: TeII
me who the thief is.''
''O dear, you are making me mad.''
''You stay in my eyes aII the time.''
''O dear, I wish you rob me.''
''And take away aII my shyness.''
''Let's pIay hide and seek.''
''Hide and seek: TeII
me who the thief is.''
''Like the cIouds of fIowers.''
''Like the dropIets.''
''I shaII dance.''
''Your screams are enough.''
''Look at her eyes and just
Iook at her rosy cheeks.''
''Look at the sexy moIe
on her cheek, O boy.''
''Just Iook at his kiIIing Iooks.''
''I Iove it. I reaIIy Iove it.''
''Let's pIay hide and seek.''
''Hide and seek: TeII

''Let's pIay hide and seek.''
''Hide and seek: TeII

''O dear, you are making me mad.''
''You stay in my eyes aII the time.''
Where's the coach?
- There.
Bye. Fast, fast.
Hey, come. Come.
Loser.
Bye.
You are running weII.
Give a shot at OIympics.
This girI seems to have some stuff.
After aII she made you chase
her and then she disappeared.
Where wiII she run? I
wiII find her out some day.
I wiII teII her that day.
- Meena.
Meena, these are the
photos the marriage bureau sent.
There are many boys
who work in banks.
Their bio-data is aIso
there behind the photo.
Have a Iook at it!
Right. There are many
urban bank directors too.
But the thing is that they
Iook Iike wanted persons.
Hey, brother. You heIp
her in seIecting a boy.
God! He is definiteIy a
wanted person. Charminar Bank.
PrudentiaI bank.
He seems to be a very
decent guy. Krushi Bank.
Meena, he Iooks great,
but he works in CTI Bank.
We can't trust them.
What's the matter?
Why are you Iike that?
Don't you Iike them?
Or is there someone you Iike?
You are even
distributing your wedding cards?
He's Uday.
He sent a Ietter to you onIy?
PersonaI Ietter.
- You may even read that.
'I Iove you. I Iove you, Meenakshi.'
'This is what I wanted to
teII you after our finaI exams.'
'You might be wondering
what this Iove-Ietter is..'
'..aIong with the wedding card.'
'I couIdn't say it to my parents.
And if I don't say this to you..'
'..I may not be
abIe to get you ever.'
'That's why I am teIIing
it, I want to marry you.'
'I can't express
how much I Iove you.'
'If you too Iove me,
then come to me.'
'I wiII come there, if you wish.'
'First Iet's go
somewhere and get married.'
'Our parents won't understand us.'
'Even your brother who is Iike
your friend won't accept it.'
'Everyone knows about his anger.'
'That's why I had no other option..'
'..even though that I
this is not the right way.'
'If you want to some, then
there're reserved train tickets..'
'..aIong with this Ietter.
TeII me your answer..'
'..on the beIow mentioned number.'
'I wiII be waiting for
your repIy, Uday.' - Ticket.
What a shock, Uday!
- What shaII I do now?
ShaII I run away?
- I wiII kiII you.
Then teII me what I shaII do.
- How wiII I teII! You teII me.
Ok, then, Iisten. I too Iike Uday.
Instead of marrying
someone unknown so caIIed..
..white coIIared officers,
it's better to marry..
..a cIassmate whom I
know since four years.
As far as I know, not
onIy with me but he didn't..
..misbehave with any girI. And
a better quaIity than that..
..is that instead of teIIing
these rubbish Iove and buIIshit..
..he asked me to marry him
and more than anything eIse..
..I too Iike him a Iot.
- I see.
So you went this far?
- I haven't gone tiII now..
..but I feeI Iike going
to any extent for him.
Ok, Ieave this to me. I
wiII take care of this.
ReaIIy? Everyone
knows about your anger.
But you don't know
about your brother's heart.
Anyway, where does he Iive?
- Madhurai.
Swami.
- Yes, sir.
Have you brought the fIowers?
- Yes, sir.
The auspicious time is here.
We'II go to Mother's tempIe..
Ok, madam.
- Do it, fast. - Fast.
Narayana, Sir is coming down.
Offer this to Mother in
the name of our son Uday's..
..marriage. - We brought
these to offer to mother..
..on the occasion of
our son's marriage.
Sir, you offer something
or other thing to Mother..
..on every occasion. - That's
not our greatness, Mr. Priest.
Mother gave it to us and we
are giving it back to Mother.
Because of Mother's mercy
on you, you got a match..
..from Govindaraju's
famiIy for your son.
Is that the vermiIion which
was offered to Mother? - Yes.
PIease give to me.
- You were born to show peopIe..
..how a perfect
husband and wife shouId be.
Sir, Mr. GovindarajuIu is coming.
The father of the bride is coming.
WeIcome. WeIcome. WeIcome.
- Greetings.
Did you come to see how the
arrangements are going on?
No, I came to ask to
postpone the marriage.
Brother! Does your
daughter have any probIem?
That's not the thing, sister.
ActuaIIy new commissioner is..
Mr. RatnaveIu.
- Right.
He has fiIed an
encroachment case on me.
He wants to arrest me on the
marriage-day and troubIe me.
What are you saying!
ShaII I go and taIk to him?
He won't Iisten to anyone.
That's why I am trying to..
..soIve this matter by
taIking to the minister in DeIhi.
And if something goes
wrong during marriage..
..then it wiII be
embarrassing to aII of us. - You are..
I feeI Iike postponing this
marriage this the issue soIves.
Brother, you don't worry.
BaIa, you caII that commissioner.
Kuppaswami. - Sir. -
Bring that phone. - Ok, sir.
Both Andhra CM and TamiI
Nadu's CM are coming..
..to the marriage ceremony.
That's why I caIIed you..
..to taIk about the security.
The reception wouId be..
..heId over there. I
guess there wouId be around..
..thousand peopIe be
eating in every batch. - Ok.
And I heard that your native
pIace is Coimbatore, right?
I heard that you
are Naidus, are you?
Getting married to a son
is so difficuIt these days..
..and I heard that
you have two daughters.
And you are aIso a very honest man.
Then how wiII you give dowry?
There are many guys
who won't take dowry.
We don't find peopIe
Iike you these days.
And by the way, do you
have any ancestraI property?
My onIy property is the IPS
certificate that is earned.
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.
PIease sit down. I
am sorry I am Iate.
I too came just a few minutes ago.
PIease eat. ActuaIIy I
was taIking to my son's..
..future father-in-Iaw,
I mean, Mr. Govindaraju..
Excuse me, sir. If you
caIIed me to taIk about him..
..then I wiII have to go
without even eating the Iunch.
PIease don't be that angry.
You can arrest him Iater..
..but first have you Iunch.
ActuaIIy I was thinking that
if you can deIay the arresting..
..tiII the marriage is over.
He is a very reputed person.
Sir, he is a very
reputed person, but the money..
..he earned iIIegaIIy
speaks everything about the man.
I have many soIid
evidences against him.
Many other reputed persons
wiII aIso be unmasked soon.
Is there some curd?
- Here it is.
What are you doing! You
caIIed him for Iunch..
..but you are taIking about arrest.
I was just taIking to
brother about him daughters.
He was saying that he wouId
get his daughters married..
..without giving dowry. Each
person is a unique person.
Where shouId I wash my hands?
- Come.
You shaII wash your
hands there. Keep it here.
Hey, who's there? Mr.
Commissioner fainted..
..and feII down. CaII
the ambuIance. - Ok, madam.
Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?
I Iike your eyes.
Your eyes don't Iike
what my eyes don't Iike.
I Iike your hands.
These hands kiII the
persons whom I don't Iike.
It's a great fortune to
get an understanding wife.
And it is the greatest fortune
to get a wife who murders others.
You are so cute, my
beautifuI bIack girI!
What did you ask for?
- Nothing.
Nothing? You must have
prayed for your Iover.
There is nothing Iike that.
Hey, Hyderabad! Hyderabad!
Hey, did Meenakshi give a caII?
- No, she didn't.
Have you written the
number correctIy in the phone?
Yes, I wrote it correctIy.
What if she is coming on train?
Our men are at the station too.
Do you think that that girI..
..wiII come? - You are the
man, and you are afraid..
..of your parents, then
how can you expect a girI..
..to come her
against her parents' wish.
I have faith on her.
- There is no use in getting tensed.
I think we shouId give
a caII to her house.
No, we can't. If his brother
picks the phone then he wiII..
Hey, bridegroom, how many
years did we study together?
Four years.
- Four years! There four years..
..you we not onIy
Meenakshi's cIassmate..
..but you were aIso my cIassmate.
Even I was your friend, wasn't I?
How can your betray one
person to Iove another!
ShaII we go aside and taIk?
- How dare you to ask..
..Meenakshi to run away!
Son, there is a minister.
Come and meet him once.
Your uncIe sent a Benz Car for
you. It's your marriage-gift.
You must see that girI.
She is fiIIed with goId.
There isn't an empty
pIace even to touch her.
Is he friend? Send
him to the guest house.
Here you are getting marriage and..
..you asked my sister to run away?
We shaII go aside and taIk.
- I don't Iike taIking behind..
..one's back. If you have
courage then, say it braveIy.
What's your finaI decision?
- Who are you?
What are you saying?
- Greetings.
Greetings.
- I came from Hyderabad.
This is the Ietter your
son wrote to my sister.
You Ioving my
sister isn't a mistake..
..but asking her to
run away is a mistake.
Even if you give such a cheap
advice she wiII never do it.
That's how much my
sister respects us.
In the same way we too
respect her and her opinions.
We respect her opinion when
she said that she Ioves you..
..and if your parents
aIso respect your decision..
..then I don't have any probIem
in getting her married to you.
Boy, shaII we go aside and taIk?
I am sorry. I don't Iike
taIking behind someone's back.
I can understand your situation.
I came here before the
reputation of both the famiIies..
..wouId have shattered.
Or eIse you know
what your son was up to.
Uday, I am not forcing you
in any way. If you reaIIy..
..want to marry my sister,
then say it to your parents.
And if you too accept
your son's decision..
..then this marriage won't happen.
Before accepting your
son's decision you must..
..aIso know about our famiIy first.
Mother. Father.
- Come.
We are sorry that we are
introducing ourseIves..
..in such circumstances.
My name is Anand Rao.
I am working as a..
..section in-charge and
she is my wife, KamaIa..
She works in the same
office as a section officer.
We aIso buiIt a house recentIy.
We are pIanning to give
that house to our daughter.
Our son said that he
didn't want any share in that.
Or course, we can't even
compete with your cIerk..
..but Mother Goddess
has given us a Iot of..
..truthfuIness and honesty.
- We are saying it in..
..the tempIe of Mother.
Our daughter is goId.
We too Iove our chiId as
much as your Iove your chiId.
We too can't Ieave our
daughter that easiIy.
That's why I am teIIing you,
Iet's go aside and taIk.
PIease come. - Now whatever is
there taIk, taIk to our son.
You come.
- Be carefuI. He is a very wise kid.
Brother, you taIked in a great way.
I am eIder than you, so Iisten
to me, Iet's go aside and taIk.
Come, brother.
This is a match of
more than 1000 crores.
And we are one of the most
reputed famiIies in the country.
This is not a doII's marriage,
that we can do..
..since our kids want.
- You caIm down, dear.
Look, brother. Find a match of you
r status for your sister..
And don't worry about the money.
I wiII give you even if
you need crores of rupees.
There isn't any currency
this worId which can buy Iove.
And we don't crores of rupees
to Iive with Iove and honesty.
Look, brother.
- You keep quiet, BaIa.
You can see what kind of
a courageous kid he is.
You came from some TeIugu province..
..and want to get her
married here in TamiI Nadu?
If your sister wiII be near you,
it wiII be good for you onIy.
He won't Iisten to us Iike that.
- Mr. MLA is here.
WeIcome him and taIk to him.
- Brother! Listen to me.
You don't know about me. I
worship peopIe if I Iike them..
..or eIse I break peopIe's Iegs.
- I am taIking in this way..
..just because of the onIy
reason that my sister Iikes you.
Or eIse breaking someone into
pieces isn't new to me either.
Uday.
Just Ioving isn't enough,
but you shouId aIso have..
..the courage to convince eIders.
Even my sister won't Iike to
Iead her Iife with a coward.
The marriage is tomorrow morning.
Think about it and
take a decision by then.
It's not right on my part to
ask you to take a decision..
..without showing my
sister. Look there.
The girI who waIking down
the stairs is my sister.
She may not be very rich,
but she is as precious as goId.
Her name is aIso Mother

They say that our son gave
her a card on her birthday..
..and that's aII. When those
twins threatened our son..
..he married her so that our
reputation shouIdn't hamper.
Father, you gave me
everything that I asked you..
..since chiIdhood. I am
asking you something..
..for the Iast time. I want
Uday. If someone tied me..
..the auspicious thread,
then it shouId be Uday.
Even though we have so much weaIth,
it isn't equaI to Uday.
I stiII Iove him.
I need him. I wiII die if I
don't get Uday. - Aishwarya.
Such is my destiny. There
are many boys interested..
..in marrying her, but she
wants to marry your son..
..who is aIready married.
- Brother-in-Iaw, it's our fortune.
No, it's our son's fortune.
It is his fortune to get such
a Ioving wife. What do you say?
You don't worry. From now,
we wiII write his destiny.
We wiII get him out of
that demon's trap. Trust me.
Yes, I know that you can.
You are very good at..
..removing your obstacIes.
- But, it isn't that sir.
ActuaIIy her brother
is our biggest enemy.
He just came, said a few words..
..and got my son marry his sister.
He stabbed us so
easiIy without even a knife.
That's why I am teIIing you,
the sooner you take our..
..Aishwarya to your home,
the better for you.
When we counted our property
Iast time, it was 1001 crores.
I wiII my entire property on
my daughter's name yesterday.
I haven't seen her crying tiII now.
Brother-in-Iaw, you
don't worry at aII.
You go to America and take
care of your business there.
And before going as
we taIked earIier..
..you said that you wouId
give a share in that contract.
I wiII give you. But before
that Iet my daughter get..
..married to your son. If you
deIay it, anything may happen.
..even my daughter mind may change..
..and even mind wouId change.
What are saying! Legs,
Iegs. HoId his Iegs.
There is no use of him anymore.
He has aIready..
..wiIIed his property
in his daughter's name.
He can be a hurdIe to use anytime.
Aishwarya! Aishwarya! You
father had a heart attack.
Aishwarya! Aishwarya! You
father had a heart attack.
Hey, is anyone there? Come here.
You go and caII the doctor.
Brother. Brother. What
happened to you, brother!
Brother. Brother. O no.
What happened?
- He has a heart attack.
We are taking him to the hospitaI.
Come this way. Easy. Easy.
HoId him.
Come fast, dear. I wiII give
you a caII from there. - Ok.
Fast. Fast.
- You too came fast, daughter.
You keep going. I wiII come.
- Ok.
My dear.
If there is your heIp to me, I
can even conquer this worId.
There are very few
coupIes who understand..
..each other weII and
we are first among them.
You are right. If
Mandodari heIped Ravana Iike you..
..Ravana wouId have been the winner.
Not onIy that, if
LeeIavati was Iike you..
..then there'd have been no
stopping to Hiranayakashyapa.
O come on, BaIa.
- I am saying the truth.
You are a roIe modeI wife.
What happened, BaIa?
Why did you get scare..
..by a dead man !
- That's not the thing.
I thought he was aIive
when his hand feII on me.
No one has the right to Iive,
when we decide to kiII them.
Anyway, when are kiIIing Meenakshi?
We shouIdn't get so anxious.
She is the girI whom our son Ioved.
Let him enjoy her first.
Then we can kiII her
in a convincing way.
So that he wouIdn't have any doubt.
His brother is the one who
shouIdn't have any doubt.
If we kiII him first, then
we won't have any hurdIe.
We wiII get 1000 crores.
- Not 1000 crores, BaIa.
shaII go to our doctor..
..and get the death report
that he died due to heart attack.
Son, Uday. More than getting sepa
rated from our daughter..
..we are more worried
about your parents' attitude..
..who were against this marriage.
Meenakshi, it's not sufficient
to just get your beIoved one..
..but your true test
wiII be winning the peopIe..
..who were against this marriage.
- Hey, Narayana.
Spray water in the garden.
- Ok, sir.
So what was your name?
- Her name is Meenakshi.
Come upstairs.
Since we were going
to the tempIe daiIy..
..Mother Meenakshi had mercy
on us and sent this Meenakshi.
My dear!
- WeII-said, dear.
Since she didn't want any
other girI to enter this house..
..so Mother herseIf
came to this house..
..in the form of
this beautifuI girI.
What is this, brother-in-Iaw!
You shouId have stayed here..
..for some more days.
There are many sights..
..that your haven't
visited in this city.
Give it hear. Dear, come.
What can be a better
sight for us that this!
It's our fortune that
our daughter became..
..the daughter-in-Iaw of this house.
She must have done good
deeds is some previous birth..
Forgive me, sir, if I
had crossed the Iine.
O, come on. Look, he
is caIIing me sir.
He is your father-in-Iaw.
If I had a daughter..
..I wouId have got her married
to you. - But one condition.
What's that?
- I'd have married her..
..onIy if her was
aIso as sIim as you are.
You too have a very good
sense of humor. - WeII-said.
Hey, Narayana.
- Yes, sir.
You must go to the station
and get them on the train.
Did you get me?
- Yes, sir.
Goodbye, uncIe. Goodbye, aunty.
- Ok.
Ok, goodbye.
- Ok. HoId on. You wait.
You didn't eat
anything since morning.
At Ieast eat this banana.
What's the matter! Is
my son-in-Iaw crying?
I wiII break it for you. Take it.
Goodbye, uncIe.
- Ok.
Goodbye.
- Ok.
Give me a caII before Ieaving.
- Ok.
Daughter, shaII we go inside? Come.
- Hey, come.
Hey, make it sharper.
- Ok.
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.
Take one of the sharpest
knives and go to Hyderabad.
ShaII I gift it to someone?
- No, you fooI.
I want you to kiII someone.
- Ok, sir.
These knives Iike
the taste of the bIood.
And they are dying for bIood.
And whom shouId I kiII? A
minister or a commissioner?
A boy?
- You want me to kiII a boy?
If I send my photo with a knife,
he wiII get a heart attack.
Don't underestimate him.
He is a student. Be carefuI.
He departed to Hyderabad
just now. You too go now.
You don't worry, sir. I wiII
bring his head within three days.
Hey.
Sorry.
- Sorry?
I guess he don't
understand what sorry means.
Speak to him in your own Ianguage.
Then he wiII understand.
Poor guy. He didn't
Iisten to us at first.
Anyway, who is he, who
had a fight intentionaIIy?
Yes, it was intentionaI.
How can his men come here..
..aII of a sudden
aIong with their knives!
It seems that someone
did it intentionaIIy.
Are they Nayakar's men? They
didn't Iike our match too.
If this happened to us,
what wouId have happened..
..to Meenakshi?
- What shaII we do?
ShaII we go back to
Madhurai from next train?
We can't wait for that Iong.
I think we'd hire a car..
..go there right now. - I'II
give a caII to Meenakshi right now.
What rubbish are you taIking!
You sent such a person that..
Hey.
Is that he?
- So he is the one who did it?
It seems he didn't
Iearn this Iesson tiII now.
We doubted Nayakar unnecessariIy.
You are one who doubted him first.
Whoever might have
doubted him first..
..we shaII give a caII to
Meenakshi to cIear the doubt.
HeIIo. - HeIIo, Meena. -
You aIready reached there?
How are you? Are you fine?
What are you asking Iike that?
I am definiteIy fine.
How was your journey?
And aIso Uday got a seat..
..in CaIifornia.
- ReaIIy? Congrats.
You give a caII to your
brother-in-Iaw and congratuIate him.
I wiII taIk to her.
HeIIo, Meena. How are you?
I am fine. Are you fine?
- Yes, we are fine.
HoId on, your father
wants to taIk to you.
Dear, take care of your heaIth.
- Ok, father.
Ok, goodbye, father.
- Ok.
'When they accepted
Meenakshi as their daughter-in-Iaw..'

He is not an ordinary person,
sir. He is a very strong man.
Did I send you make this discovery?
What are your knives for?
Why do your worship them?
You said that he wouId
get a heart attack..
..when he sees your photo.
What happened now?
He isn't abIe to Iook
straight into our eyes now.
Turn this way. - I can't show
you my face tiII I kiII him.
From now onwards this
is not just revenge..
..this is my revenge too. I
swear on God, I wiII kiII him.
I wiII see.
You said that Iet him enjoy.
But now she is pregnant.
When wiII her time come?
- From now onwards..
..every moment is a
dangerous moment for her.
Our son trust us
compIeteIy that we treat..
..our daughter-in-Iaw as goddess.
We shouId kiII her now.
The way he stabbed
us with his words..
..now we have to kiII
his sister that way.
We must kiII those twins at once.
- Right.
Meenakshi.
- Mother-in-Iaw.
Father-in-Iaw went to bath.
There isn't water in the tank.
WiII you pIease go and
switch on the motor?
O no. It seems no one
fiIIed the tanker at morning.
AII the servants
went on a Ieave at once.
It's you?
Demon ! When did you come?
- Just now.
What a surprise! - I feIt
Iike coming here, so I came.
I toId you that we don't
need speciaI occasions..
..to meet our near ones.
Not onIy me, but I aIso..
..brought mother and
father. Go and see.
Father.
Mother.
- How are you, dear?
I am fine.
- How are you, dear?
I am fine, father. Come.
Is this true? I didn't see you.
When did you come, sister-in-Iaw?
Why didn't you give us
a caII before coming?
One can visit onIy a
daughter without informing.
There's a saying is
our province, sister.
We can see who came
to guests by Iooking..
..at the footwear.
- How's that?
If the footwear at the door,
then the guests are from..
..the son's side, and if the
footwear are near kitchen..
..then the guests are
from daughter-in-Iaw's side.
Then Iet's do one thing. Let's
fix a shoe-stand near kitchen.
What's the matter, uncIe?
What's that get-up about?
Has aunty..
- No, that's not the thing.
ActuaIIy I was about to
take a bath and I heard you.
Wait for a moment! I
wiII switch on the motor.
Come on ! Our guests are here.
O, no. I forgot to
switch on the motor.
You stop here. There is a
surprise for you. - What's that?
Come, Iet's go inside.
- Come inside, sister-in-Iaw.
See, what I brought for you.
- Thanks.
You go inside. I wiII switch
on the motor. - Stop here.
Where is our son-in-Iaw?
He isn't here?
He went outside. He
wiII be back in a moment.
Is our daughter troubIing you?
TroubIe! She is troubIing me a Iot!
Mother-in-Iaw, eat this.
Mother-in-Iaw, eat that.

Meenakshi, I am taIking to you.
Won't you show the

This is a festive season

Won't you show that
tempIe to your brother?
Yes, Meena. You

Ok, goodbye. Goodbye, father.
- Ok, take care of yourseIf.
Bye.
- Ok.
Goodbye, mother.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Ok. - Inform us when you get Visa.
Ok. Meena, don't

Yes, dear. Go and visit the tempIe.
By the way, where is that tempIe?
- I know where it is.
From there come to our estate.
You can aIso see that.
Give me the keys.
- Hey, Narayana, how is the car?
I got it checked Iast night.
- Goodbye, uncIe.
Ok.
BaIa, arrange for

..and aIso arrange the

OnIy when they wiII come to Iunch.
O, come on.
Dear, do you think those
twins wouId have died by now?
Yes, this is the
most dangerous time..
..according to the astroIogy.
They wiII definiteIy die.
That means Govinraju's
It's not 1000, but
it is 1001 crores.
My dear! You are very
good at mathematics.
You went on Safari, but you
returned on an Auto-rickshaw?
We just escaped on Safari.
- You escaped?
That means there was an accident?
Safari's brakes faiIed.
- What! Did something happen to you?
You are aIso a pregnant Iady.
- Where is driver Narayana?
What can he do about it, uncIe..
..when the brakes faiIed.
- Today it's a very good day.
Thank God, both of you escaped.
- Come, dear.
Our Goddess saved you.
Come, Iet's visit tempIe.
She is tensed
because of the accident.
How can she go to tempIe now!
Are you worrying, daughter?
ShaII we go to home first?
It's ok, mother-in-Iaw.
- Anyway, since we came here..
..we wiII see it. Is this the
pIace from the commissioner..
..has been pushed?
- Who? - We didn't get you.
There was a big
sensation in the newspaper..
..that someone pushed
the commissioner from here.
No one pushed him, nephew! He
had some iIIness. - IIIness?
Vertigo. - With which
they faint, that iIIness.
What's the need to taIk
about those things now?
Nephew, come. I wiII show
you the pIan of this buiIding.
It's great, uncIe. - It's great,
but there is a probIem.
There is a Iot of vacant space Ieft.
Our engineer is giving
us some ideas, but..
Hey, you are aIso an
engineering student..
Give me a pIan.
- What pIan can I give, uncIe?
You said it right.
Nephew can give a good idea.
You think about it and teII
me. Hey, are the meaIs ready?
Can you see that pIace? From
there to there is our Iand.
You uncIe wiIIed
that pIace in your name.
Brother.
Someone save me.
BaIa.
Dear.
O God!
O dear.
O dear, get down. Get down.
Are you ok?
- Am I stiII aIive?
Don't taIk Iike that.
Thank you, son. How
can I pay you for this!
If you wouIdn't have
saved her, I wouId have died.
O, pIease don't
speak Iike that, uncIe.
Anyway, how did you
faII in that, aunty?
Our time is going bad.
- Aunty, Are you fine?
Nothing happened to
her. I stopped her..
..when she said that we
shouId go to the tempIe.
That's why this happened.
Come, Iet's go to tempIe.
HeIIo, Mr. Narsarao.
- Who's that?
Is it true that you are
visiting anger management centre?
Who said that? Who is
that useIess feIIow?
I got it. He might have Iied to me.
ShaII we go into the tempIe, father?
UseIess feIIow!
- What's that! - Nothing.
Mr. Priest, offer this to
Mother so that I'd get a promotion.
If you need to appIy petition,
then go to Mother Jaya.
I know whom we shouId ask what.
You pronounce the chants weII.
You cIose your eyes.
'Mother, even if I don't pass
in my exams, I won't compIain..'
'..but get my father
transferred to Rajasthan.'
'..and if possibIe
transfer him to Pakistan.'
'Or eIse at Ieast make me deaf.'
What did you ask for?
The Iight went off.
I prayed for your promotion.
- I wiII think about my probIems.
You just think about
your own probIems.
Pray mother to pass in the exams..
..and to get a husband Iike
Lord Krishna. - Like Krishna?
No, I am Lord Rama. Pray
for a husband Iike Sri Rama.
CIose your eyes.
- Mother, don't give me a husband..
..Iike Rama or Krishna.
But send a husband Iike..
..Ravanasa for me. He wiII be
a perfect match for my father.
Don't keep your mouth Iike
that. The fIies may get in.
That day you gave me a
fIying kiss in Hyderabad.
Are you that attracted
towards me? Do you know peopIe..
..give fIying kisses? When the
person whom we want to kiss..
..isn't near us. I came near you
so that it wouId be convenient..
..for you. Kiss me. Kiss me.
What did you ask my daughter?
Muddupedatava(wiII you kiss me)?
- What!
Muddukedatava(WiII
you move forward)?
You come with me.
- Save me Mother.
Muddu(Kiss). Mundu(Go forward).
You come here. Worship these Gods.
What did you scream Iike that?
I feIt Iike something has bitten
me. - ReaIIy? I wiII sIice you.
Focus on God. CIose your eyes.
What happened to you, father?
- Something has bitten me too.
I guess Mother is
angry with us. Come.
Rupa.
Who's that? Who caIIed you?
- I don't know, father.
Then who's it? It seems
that it was a man's voice.
Come. Not that way, but this way.
Rupa.
Why is someone caIIing you onIy?
Is he that person?
- No.
Then whose voice was that.
How do you know him?
Since how many
days is this going on?
Did you come to
tempIe to worship God..
..or meet that person?
TeII me. TeII me the truth.
Why are you revoIving around us?
- Muddu(Kiss).
What!
- Mokku(A part of worship)
Then why are you revoIving
round us? - Mokku. Mokku.
Oh ! The hoIy ring.
Mother, forgive us.
Not once, but you must dip thrice.
Rupa.
PIease, I beg you. Leave me.
My father wiII kiII me.
PIease, pIease, pIease.
Rupa.
Where has she gone? Has she sunk?
Rupa.
Where has she gone? What's this!
You dipped there and
you came out here.
And where did that chain
came from in your neck?
How did the chain come here
that you Iost it in Hyderabad!
And where are your bangIes?
- Yes, where are they?
You come here first.
Give me that chain first.
Who knows what you
wiII Iose this time!
Now come out from where you dip.
Father, do I have to dip again?
No, it's enough, father.
Do what I say! It's a
rituaI to dip thrice.
Are you swimming inside for so Iong?
What's that! Your bangIes are back?
Are you trying to
fooI your own father?
How did you get
your chain over here..
..that you Iost in Hyderabad?
And how are you getting..
..bangIes which you Iost once?
What's going on inside?
What eIse have you Iost
inside, useIess feIIow?
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''
''Do anything, but
that thing is wrong.''
''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''
''Hey, beauty. It was a
Iot of fun beIow water.''
''I pIayed with your beauty.''
''Stop it, boy.''
''HonestIy, even I am enjoying it.''
''You can't hide that joy.''
''Don't get too anxious.''
''You can't hide that joy.''
''Don't get too anxious.''
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''
''Do anything, but

''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''
''When are we going
to Iove in BhimiIi?''
''When are we going
to start a famiIy?''
''Why do you get so
anxious when I am near you?''
''Even I can't resist you.''
''This girI's every
part is beautifuI.''
''I wish I couId hug her forever.''
''This boy's eyes are very naughty.''
''And this girI goes weak on knees.''
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''
''Do anything, but
that thing is wrong.''
''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''
''I am a girI as sharp as a knife.''
''You may ask it to
any boy of my city.''
''Whatever I may do I

''It isn't wrong if
accept my proposaI.''
''Come to me tomorrow,
another fIirt Krishna.''
''There shouId be fixed
time even for fIirting.''
''It the effect of
Iayers of the water.''
''PIease don't stop me.''
''Hey, girI, what shaII we do?''
''Go and order a coffee for me.''
''How dare you to order me!''
''Your pIans won't
succeed in front of me.''
''Hey, beauty. It was a
Iot of fun beIow water.''
''I pIayed with your beauty.''
''Stop it, boy.''
''HonestIy, even I am enjoying it.''
''You can't hide that joy.''
''Don't get too anxious.''
''You can't hide that joy.''
''Don't get too anxious.''
Did you finaIIy come out? Now
aII the dips are over. Come.
Father, may I dip three more times?
You need not to. Come out.
What's the matter!
You are offering dips?
It's for you onIy, for your weIfare.
Now stop it. How come
you became so reIigious..
..aII of a sudden?
TeII me what's the matter?
Leave me. Do you think I am kid?
- Yes, of course.
Now Iook at me, I am
about to be a mother soon.
You first teII me.
- Leave me, I wiII teII you.
Do you remember I toId you
about a girI in Hyderabad..
..who fIirted with me
and disappeared? - Yes.
And she surfaced here.
- Here? In this city?
Now see, I wiII take revenge.
Did you see what a coincidence!
We both are getting
souI-mates in Madurai.
Aishwarya, Uday is getting
prepared to go to America.
If you go there and take
care of your businesses..
..he wiII come and join
you Iater as we pIanned.
Then your wish wiII be
fuIfiIIed and your father's souI..
..wiII get peace.
- He is right, dear.
And by then Meenakshi and
his brother wiII be finished.
They can't escape this time.
And when both of you'II return,
everything wiII be in pIace.
If things don't get right,
then I wiII have to Iook for..
..some other person.
- Don't speak Iike that, dear.
He is yours. He beIongs to you.
You can do anything
with him. Am I right?
Yes, and take care
of those keys, dear.
Be carefuI.
Meenakshi.
- Mother-in-Iaw.
I need to grind this medicine.
Where's the stone?
The stone is in the store-room.
I wiII bring it.
Leave me. Leave me.
Madam.
What happened?
- Disaster happened, madam.
What happened?
- Mother-in-Iaw.
How is that 'sindoor' on your cheek?
The thing is that, mother-in-Iaw.
- Narayana.
Sir. Sir.
- What happened?
I wish I wouId have been
dead before speaking about this.
Sir..
- Mother-in-Iaw, the thing is that..
Sir. - What happened?
TeII me what happened?
Sir, your daughter-in-Iaw
said that she Iust for me and..
..that she wants to make
Iove with me and forced me to..
Mother-in-Iaw..
- Sir.
Sir, kiII me. Sir, kiII me.
You shouIdn't have marriage
this Iady. - Mother-in-Iaw..
Meenakshi, don't feeI tensed.
Say it sIowIy what happened.
Brother, he tried to..
- What's going on !
Wait a moment, mother-in-Iaw.
Did Meenakshi go to that..
..store-room herseIf or did
you ask someone asked her to go?
I sent her.
- What for?
I sent her for the stone
to grind the medicine.
That means she went onIy
when you asked her to go..
..but she didn't go there by
herseIf. How can she know..
..that the driver is
there in the storeroom!
Hey, you..
My sister Iust for you? Is
that what you want to say?
How did you face injured?
- The thing is that..
..when I say madam and
tried to run outside.
She threw a stone on me.
- If she threw a stone on you..
..then it shouId have hit on the
back side, but not on the face.
And why were you there
in that room? - ActuaIIy..
I went for the tooIkit of the car.
- TooIkit?
That shouId be in the car.
Why was it in the storeroom?
That tooIkit is missing. So
I went for the spare tooIkit.
Is it there?
Is the tooIkit there?
- No, it isn't there.
Let's go and check.
This is the hand which
saved father-in-Iaw..
..when he got the current shock.
This is the hand which saved
mother-in-Iaw from death..
..when she was faIIing in the Iift.
How dare you to misbehave
with their daughter-in-Iaw..
..even after being their servant!
TeII me. TeII me did you do this..
Sir. Sir.
You Ieave him, son.
RascaI, how dare you to do that!
Sir. Sir.
- How dare you to do that!
UncIe! Don't troubIe yourseIf.
I wiII take care of him.
I beg you, don't beat me.
I have done a mistake.
Madam, forgive me.
Sir, madam is a goddess.
I did this mistake since I
was attracted towards madam.
Madam, forgive me.
- Get Iost.
UncIe, throw him out
of the job right now..
..or eIse I wiII kiII him right now.
If I see you again, I
wiII kiII you first.
Forgive us.
Take her inside.
'AII the incidents that were
happening were suspicious.'
'Why wouId someone try to kiII me?'
'Not onIy on me, but
such kind of attempts..'
'..were aIso being
done on Meenakshi.'
'When I think about the
insuIt that have been done..'
'..to Meenakshi, my bIood
starts burning with anger.'
Meena. What is your
opinion on your in-Iaws?
Hey, God wiII punish
you if you doubt them.
And haven't you seen
how they Iook after me?
That's what I am
unabIe to understand.
When I see them, they
appear Iike Gods as you said.
But the incidents that are
happening are suspicious.
And aIso Uday is
going to America now.
I was wondering that
it's been a whiIe since..
..you haven't fought with someone.
Hey, pIease Iet me Iive with peace.
Both of them are treat me
Iike their own daughter.
In fact when I am with them,
I never miss you peopIe.
They are Gods.
This hasn't been done by our Gods..
..but it has been done
by your God. Look there.
Uday, the fIight from Bombay is at
WiII you give me a
caII before departing?
Ok, I wiII not get on the fIight
before taking your permission.
And keep this passport safeIy.
- Ok.
Uday, I am not happy
with you going at this time.
What do you mean by this time?
The incidents that are
happening consecutiveIy.
I don't want Meena
to Iive be here aIone.
It's not for too Iong,
just six months.
Anyway, she is coming to your
home to deIivery next month.
If you wish she wiII stay
there for coupIe of months more.
What do you say, Meena?
You are right. Meena
wiII come to our home..
..next month anyway. Can I
take here there tomorrow?
You can take her if she
doesn't have any probIem.
What are you saying! You
are asking him to take..
..daughter-in-Iaw tomorrow?
Let her stay here..
..for some more days. It's
not auspicious to send her..
..during the eight month. We
wiII send her in the beginning..
..of the ninth month
as per the tradition.
No, mother-in-Iaw. I wiII
take Meenakshi with me tomorrow.
Hey, they are eIders. They
know what is right and..
..what is wrong.
- You keep quiet. I am asking them.
I can understand you
sibIings' sentiment.
And mother is aIso right.
She wiII come there next month.
Swami, bring the Iuggage down.
- Ok, madam.
Uday, I toId you, either you go Ia
ter or I wiII take her with me.
What's this, son ! Why are you
taIking Iike that at this time!
That's what I am aIso saying.
What's this at this time!
What's this fooIishness!
How can be so scared..
..at some things which
happened accidentaIIy.
Even I can't understand it. I
feeI Iike something is going on.
Why are you taIking as if I am
Ieaving you sister intentionaIIy!
Aren't my mother
and father with her?
What eIse can
better safety than this?
I can't trust anyone right now.
What did you say! How
can you doubt my parents..
..who treat her as
their own daughter!
I am not doubting them, but
the circumstances are such..
What rubbish !
- Uday. Uday.
He is apprehensive
since she is her sister.
He is taIking as if
we are her enemies.
What rubbish are you taIking!
I am not your sister anymore.
You be within your Iimits.
You just wait. I am taIking to them.
Listen to me, Uday. AII the
incidents that have happened..
..are suspicious. How
can the car brakes faiIed..
How can
mother-in-Iaw faII in the Iift!
How can the motor go
wrong when switched on !
How can that driver
misbehave with the pregnant woman !
Do you have an answer
to anyone one these?
So you want to say that my
parents are behind aII these?
That's not the thing,
brother-in-Iaw!
Don't caII me brother-in-Iaw.
Get out of here.
How dare you to speak about
us Iike that in our own house!
First get out. Get out of our house.
Get out.
If I hurt you, then I am sorry.
I am teIIing you again, Meena
isn't safe here without you.
Won't you Iet me Iive with peace?
You get out of here first.
Get out. They are Gods.
If you doubt them, then
you wiII be insuIting me.
You don't know anything. You
keep quiet. - You shut up.
You get out of here.
- Meenakshi, I am taIking to him.
You get out.
- Meena! Listen to me.
Get out of here.
- Meena! Listen to me.
Listen to me, Meena.
- You go away.
Meena, Iisten to me. Meena.
Get Iost. Father-in-Iaw, he
doesn't know about you weII.
I am apoIogizing to you on
his behaIf. PIease forgive him.
He can't be forgiven.
If he comes here again..
..or you go there, both
of us wiII have to suffer.
Uday, Uday, don't speak Iike that.
He is behaving so
because of his anger.
Your wife wiII Iive
happiIy as many days God wants.
Take her inside. You go inside.
Hey, go you to work. Do your work.
You asked me kiss.
Is that sufficient..
..or do you want more?
We can't stop with a kiss.
So take me away with you?
- Where?
Let's run away.
- What's the need to run away?
Or eIse my father wiII
kiII me if teII him about you.
Are you so scared of your father?
- Very much.
But I don't Iike the
girIs who are get so afraid.
Hey, is the Tiffin box ready? I a
m getting Iate to office.
Here it is.
- Give it, fast.
Hey, have you bunked the schooI?
- I am going.
Father, your fiIes.
- Why don't you give them to me?
Everyone just gives direction.
- Father-in-Iaw, your gIasses.
Give it to me. O God.
I am getting Iate.
Father, don't go to office today.
I need to taIk to you.
Is that so urgent? Today is
Sunday. Let's taIk tomorrow.
It isn't possibIe. I need
to taIk to you right now.
Come.
TeII me what it is.
- You first take these BP tabIets.
I wiII teII you after that.
Now teII me.
- I Iove a person.
Water.
We met in Hyderabad. He
finished his engineering.
He is a very good-Iooking guy.
He is a straightforward guy.
I Iike him a Iot. I
want to marry him.
Geeta.
Geeta, come with me.
No one can stop my Iove.
Nothing eIse in this worId..
..has as much power
as the true Iove has.
Break the shackIes of this
crueI men and crueI society..
..and come to me. For you, for
you Iove, I am ready to take..
..anyone's Iife and even
to sacrifice my Iife, Geeta.
These eIders wiII
never understand our Iove.
Come, Geeta. Come.
Throw this dust in the dustbin.
What eIse can be
better than a son-in-Iaw..
..who has made my daughter
so courageous! Where is he?
KiII him.
How many times do I've to
teII you not to come to my home!
I was about to go to the graveyard..
..but IuckiIy I came to your home.
What happened? Didn't you
kiII him? Where is Mani?
Mani! He got beaten up. He
won't get weII for a coupIe..
..coupIe of months. We are not
sure if he wiII ever get weII.
Sir, he is not an ordinary
person. He is Iike a demon.
We were ten peopIe
and he was just one.
Look over there.
Look, there. How your
brother is defaming us!
Ours is a famiIy who cares for
reputation more than our Iives.
What's this! Have you gone mad?
Won't you Iet me Iive with peace?
I am doing aII this for your sake.
I won't go tiII you
come to our house.
Don't troubIe me Iike
this. This is my house.
I am very happy here.
PIease don't defame us..
..due to your assumptions.
- No, Meena.
There is no doubt. They are
trying to kiII both you and me.
Just now ten
rowdies came to kiII me.
AII these days I thought
that he is chasing me..
..since I have beaten him Hyderabad.
But he came to
Hyderabad from here to kiII me.
He tried to kiII me in
the pond a few days ago.
You don't stay here even for
a second. They wiII kiII you.
They wiII kiII you, Meena.
- Now stop it.
God wiII punish you.
- You see what truth is.
Look into your father-in-Iaw's
eyes. He is a bIack cobra.
Look at your mother-in-Iaw.
She isn't a Iady,
but she is an animaI.
The peopIe of Madhurai don't
know about their reaI seIf.
Boy, what happened to you !
What are you saying!
This is not you. It
seems that some eviI eye..
..has cast a speII on you. You
come inside. Let's taIk there.
Bring some water.
- Hey, bring some water.
Don't misunderstand your brother.
We'II offer prayers to Mother.
Everything wiII be aIright.
Hey, bring some water. - This may
be due to some eviI spirit.
You come inside, son-in-Iaw.
- Now stop it.
What's this!
- You come here, daughter-in-Iaw.
Stop this act.
You are the one who
took out the car brakes.
You are the one who
made the Iift faII.
You are the one who
organized that motor-mishap.
And you are behind
even that driver's act.
Hey, Naikar, it isn't
manIy to stab from behind.
If you have guts, then
remove your mask and fight me.
Hey, you get Iost from here. Fath
er-in-Iaw, forgive me.
I can't controI him anymore.
PIease caII the poIice..
..and ask them to drag
him away. Ask him to go.
You don't worry, Meenakshi.
Even the God can't remove from here.
I won't Iet anyone
harm you tiII I am aIive.
ShaII we caII the poIice?
- No.
Look, how he is shouting
about the murder we've done.
CaIIing poIice wouId
be harmfuI to us onIy.
Hey, Naikar.
Mother Meenakshi is
there is protect Madhuri.
And I am there to
protect my Meenakshi.
Look. Those twins
shouId die at once.
After Mother's worship
he shouId die outside..
..when she wiII die inside.
And bury him safeIy.
Now get Iost.
Rupa toId me about you
and now I saw you myseIf.
I am your friend in your sorrows.
I can understand how much
you wouId care for your wife..
..when you care so
much about your sister.
Son, I wish that before the
Mother's worship is over..
..aII your sister's
troubIes shouId vanish.
This is the first time my
father taIked so sIowIy.
Now even I got a Iot of courage.
TeII me what I shaII
do for your sister.
