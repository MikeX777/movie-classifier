WITHOUT APPARENT MOTIVE
Our story is the adventure of a man
looking for a hidden truth...
... and it would be no adventure if it did
not happen to a man fit for adventure.
Hello Mr Carella, good to
have you back home again.
Going to the precinct now?
Keep in touch.
Anytime you want me to come
up just whistle, alright?
Day 1
Please give me a voice
test Mr Sabirnou.
My name is Julien Sabirnou saying
i'm sick of this stupid show.
Once more for camera 5.
My name is Julien Sabirnou saying
i'm sick of this stupid show, ok?
- Good morning sunshine.
- Hello Julien.
You know we ought to use the tip of
your ear as the next mystery object.
Can you imagine
the questions?
Excuse me.
Sandra, if your mother
finds out about this.
No, you mustn't
begin preaching.
Will you at least show
up for lunch today?
That's what mother says
to you every morning.
My stepfather doesn't
seem to like you.
It's an old story.
Was it a woman?
I don't see where the banks
would give us trouble,
we can very easily get
a long term mortgage.
Just look at that property,
you won't find anything like it.
As I was saying, I know you
can make an arrangement,
you'll get a loan at the bank,
there won't be any problem.
Here look, I brought the
contract proposals along.
You can see that the
actual risk is...
Look out, help me, help me.
Slowly, slowly, watch his head.
Carefully.
- You heard nothing at all?
- No, he just grabbed his forehead.
- Then he fell against you?
- Yes, so I held onto him.
- They must've used a
silencer. - That's very good.
You said that he was
reaching for his bag.
Well he was looking
for something.
- Say anything? - He
mentioned some papers.
- What papers? - Here
they are Mr Carella.
Thanks Di Bozzo.
Hey, you two see anyone?
We also found this
inside of his bag.
- Well Doume?
- The cartridge.
22 long rifle, imagine how
many there are in France.
It's not going
to be very easy.
Shall I inform the family?
No, you'd better let me,
I already know them all.
I think you're missing some
details in the section up there.
- Mr Barroyer.
- Yes.
Check the original plan.
For you...
- She says it's personal.
- Thanks you very much madam.
Hello.
Morning, how are you?
Your husband?
Tell me.
Fine, i'll meet you
at the club then.
I'll be there, I
love you, goodbye.
Inspector Carella, has something
about that old business come up again?
No Mlle Forest, that's not
what's brought me here.
It's your stepfather...
i'm afraid he's been killed.
Shot by a sniper.
How horrible for my mother.
When did you see him
for the last time?
An hour or so ago, not more.
- Where did you see him?
- He drove by the square I...
I was with Julien Sabirnou, where
'The Mystery Object's televised.
- And did he stop to talk?
- Yes.
- What did he say?
- Nothing important.
Now look Mlle Forest, it could
be the last thing he ever said...
And that's important.
I don't think he liked my
being with Julien Sabirnou.
Sabirnou, the MC on the show?
Is that all?
- Put something on Sandra.
- No not now mother.
Go and change.
You said you'd
finished this case.
It concerns your
husband madam Forest.
You're going to need all your
courage my dear madam Forest but...
I want you to know my wife and I
are with you in this terrible ordeal.
Thank you, you're
very kind but...
I am not alone, I can't
talk to you right now.
Had your husband ever
been threatened?
Been threatened... why no.
He had no enemies.
You must pardon me for
asking madam Forest...
- Was your husband faithful?
- What do you mean by that?
You feel you knew
everything that concerned him?
My husband had a
character above reproach.
It's really awful.
No, i'm sorry,
I won't disturb her.
I'll tell her then, alright.
Not now please.
Thank you so much,
it's very kind.
- Was he an admirable man?
- Admired would be more like it.
Why's that?
Does my stepfather's life
interest you that much?
Mlle Forest, everyone's private
life makes up part of mine.
Get me the records on
the "Andriana Case".
Narcotics, you'll find it there.
The one involving the Forest girl.
I don't believe there'd be a
connection between the two of those.
You're not paid to think...
get me the records.
Why did he carry this around?
Well it helped him when they
study insects in the forest.
It also helps start
fires out there.
That's scraping the
bottom of the barrel...
today there are more
important things for us to do.
- Will I see you later? - As
soon as I get rid of my husband.
Look, blood.
What happened?
This was found in
his trunks rolled up.
That so?
Think it's normal?
Ah no madam, so sorry...
you see the mystery object
cannot be found in your apartment.
- Sorry.
- But thank you for trying.
- Your name sir if
you will. - Mr Remi.
Mr Remi, now Mr Remi?
Mr Sabirnou, can I beat
my wife with the object...
I mean the mystery object?
Beat your wife?
No sir, i'm so sorry.
Same type man, same type wound.
And i'll bet the lab
report will be the same.
It's some kind of nut of course.
So this murderer is after...
fellows 40 years old who
are married and have money.
Sounds promising.
We're going to have to
investigate their past lives.
- Political pasts?
- Political, sexual, financial.
- A stink that'll make in town.
- And all of France possibly.
- And I have a great date tonight.
- A little chastity won't hurt you.
- Got another?
- Sure.
Is that all?
Open the window.
No comment please.
Good morning commissioner.
- And so what have you?
- Same bullets, same crime.
- That's efficient. - We just
started the investigation sir.
You've nothing else?
Excuse me sir, the
file on Sandra Forest
- Thanks, get me Di Bozzo
at the Forest home. - Yes sir.
I'll take it on this line.
Yes commissioner, I
have two dead bodies.
Amusing.
Wait a minute.
Political, i'm telling
you it's political.
- Hello.
- Two interesting facts...
One, Forest and Barroyer
didn't know each other...
Two, madam Forest had
an appointment with...
her astrologer at
the time of the murder.
A certain Hans Kleinberg.
- Hans what?
- Kleinberg.
Do me a favour, check all
the leftist organisations.
Just like they're doing to me.
I see the basic technique:
Terrorise the middle classes,
spread hysteria and then...
Grab the government.
Maybe the CIA's behind all
this, or it might be NATO.
How can you overlook them?
Let's try to talk seriously
about this commissioner.
I'm asking if you'll be
serious now... Mr Carella.
Who introduced you
to this Kleinberg?
My husband.
Your husband was
interested in astrology?
No, he did have some
business with him though.
Did you know that
Forest belonged to...
an organisation of super-militants
during the war in Algeria?
And Barroyer...?
When he was 18 years old he was
known as a card carrying communist.
And 4 years later you know
what they threw him out for?
For beating up
the cell commander.
What does that prove?
In my youth I was a devout anarchist,
I couldn't stand the establishment.
Forest and Barroyer didn't
know each other maybe however...
between us both there was
something connecting them.
- It's confidential.
- What have you learned?
They secretly held bank
accounts in Switzerland.
Well if you want to swap secrets
here's a good one commissioner...
I would say about half the
middle class here in Nice...
maintain secret bank
accounts in Switzerland.
Well then i'll give you a
further tip Mr Carella.
As a personal favour,
I must insist on that...
I know who smuggles the funds, i'd
say his job's somewhat unorthodox...
let me say, he's able to
tell someone's fortune...
but simultaneously
he's able to bank it.
- Kleinberg the astrologer?
- Correct.
Try to relax.
The influence Saturn has, though
understand it's neither significant...
nor of much importance to your
astral plane, can hardly do...
You don't seem to
really... be in tune.
Let's forget about
Saturn shall we?
I'd be much more
interested if you'd tell me...
how you got money from Mr Forest
and Mr Barroyer into Switzerland.
It's a one man operation,
Switzerland is my country.
And let's face it, I
only did it to help.
If I hadn't agreed they would have
both asked somebody else inspector.
Excuse me.
Mr Di Bozzo my assistant, Mr Kleinberg
the well known Swiss astrologer.
Up here you're a
beautiful target.
- Sir.
- We'll be in touch.
And now a very charming
and lovely contestant.
Alright Mlle, do you have any
idea what the mystery object is?
Go on Mlle, speak up.
DOUBLE MURDER MYSTERY
Drop everything, we'll
concentrate on this exclusive.
- Get me a line to Paris.
- Right away.
- Think it's political this story?
- It could be an old score.
That's absurd, the mafia
doesn't exist here in France.
And Carella the detective,
is he well known?
He certainly is.
I know he's one of the best
marksmen they ever had in the force.
And another thing...
he's the one responsible for breaking up
that "Andriani" traffic and dope ring.
But didn't that
stepdaughter of Forest...
turn out to be mixed
up in the Adriani ring?
Mixed up, that's
one way to put it.
In fact, she was the one who
turned them in to detective Carella.
Oh wow.
Would a rifle with a
scope be listed here?
Sorry, there are only
pistol sales on file.
Great.
Thanks.
- Mr Carella.
- Yes.
Hurry over, there's a
prowler out in the garden.
- Where's your mother?
- In her room.
Lock all the doors,
i'll be right over.
- Come out or i'll shoot.
- Don't be an idiot.
And when I think of how much
my mother thought of him.
You don't know the things
that can be found when...
you dig into someone's
life like this.
- What's going on? - Nothing
mother, go back to bed.
Hello.
- Hello, who is it? - Hello
Jocelyne, how are you?
I can't believe it, Carella.
What happened,
changed your mind?
I wondered how
you'd been doing.
- Are you free tomorrow?
- Where?
- My place. - Alright, i'll be there.
- Will you buy me lunch?
- Sure, till tomorrow, bye.
Let me hang onto this.
Day 2
I hope you won't
be upset Sandra but...
for the time being I think
we'd better not be seen together.
I won't be upset.
My future son-in-law is definitely
Aquarius and my daughter is Taurus.
I found out my future son-in-law's
mother is Aries, imagine!
Only I have been unable to find out
exactly when his father was born.
Well, the only thing I can
possibly tell you now madam is...
to me, your astral signs are
confused, most complicated...
but you know I told
you that last month.
I believe you also said you'd
be helpful predicting the future.
Oh no no, never, i'm sorry.
Help!
Come on, help me.
It's impossible for us to put
men on every rooftop in the city.
We're getting reinforcements
from Cannes and Marseilles.
An investigative committee is
already on it's way to Geneva.
It's Paris sir.
Ah, the ministry, before long
they'll be here, you'll see.
Right.
Police headquarters
can I help you?
Family, friends, contacts, employees,
mistresses, buddies in the army...
We have to check out everyone who
knew Forest, Barroyer or Kleinberg.
- It's in their past i'm sure.
- We don't have enough men.
Like hell, in 24 hours we'll
have half the French force here.
Jocelyne i'm leaving for lunch now.
You'll lock everything up won't you?
See you later.
Bon appetit doctor.
Yes.
Right.
Better check it out.
It's nice you called
me, I was surprised.
I thought perhaps
everything had ended.
That i'd lost my appeal.
Physically speaking of course.
It's a difficult matter to
let go a lovely young lady...
with whom you've tried
to live for 2 years.
I'm flattered.
Did you know Tony Forest?
Dirty rat!
- That's what made you
call me up. - Yes.
Did you know him?
The fact is until I knew
you there were other men...
and among them I must
admit I knew Tony Forest.
And how do you explain your name
written in red in his notebook?
- And have you seen him
lately. - It's about a week.
Why?
You're pushing me.
Did Tony Forest say anything to you
that could be of interest to me?
Yes...
That he loved me.
And Barroyer, did you know him?
In case you're asking me, no,
I never had an affair with him.
What do you think? That I
cast a spell on the two of them?
But you did know them.
So I knew them, that
doesn't make it a crime.
Barroyer I knew
at the university.
Tony Forest went there also.
I was studying medicine.
Kleinberg, did he
study there too?
The fact is I came here
today for one reason...
I foolishly thought you'd changed
your mind since our vacation.
I wasn't expecting
the third degree.
- You mentioned Kleinberg?
- Yes, mean anything to you?
Jocelyne, was he also with
you at the university?
Let go Carella,
please leave me alone.
In 48 hours, i've had no clue to
give me a motive for these 3 murders.
Kleinberg.
Come on, we'd better
talk about it quietly.
Have a drink.
Whisky? Martini?
Mr Carella, could I possibly
do something for you?
Yes, call the police and tell
them to block off the area.
Right away.
- You knew this woman?
- For some time.
- She'd just left you?
- Yes.
- Did she know anything
we could use? - The proof!
Looks as though he missed
her first time around.
- You say you never heard
any shooting. - No.
He apparently readjusted his
sights while she was with you.
Meaning what
i'd like to know?
- Oh you're upset.
- Of course i'm upset.
If I should get the first shot
I guarantee I won't miss him.
May I know why you
asked her to come here?
- What are you doing?
- Have you noticed?
They were all killed in or
near the same neighbourhood.
- We'll leave you alone.
- No, that's alright.
You we're asking me a question.
I wanted to know your reason
for asking her to come here.
- She was listed in
Forest's diary. - His diary?
Yes, his diary in
which he wrote...
the names and phones of
all the girls he knew.
- He also grades them.
- And what grade did she get?
It's a damn good grade!
We've got to verify
all those addresses.
Investigate every woman there.
That might well be the first clue
we have to connect the victims.
We have to go back to Forest again,
we have to push his wife some more.
And talk with his
stepdaughter Sandra.
Come on, let's get to work.
Look, it's very serious,
it'd be hard for me to explain.
I'm next on the list.
How are you involved
in this business?
I'm deeply involved
in the whole story.
- They'd never make an attempt
on a person like you. - Sorry?
What does that mean?
When you know the truth you'll discover
the others happen to be just as bad.
And what's stopping you
from going to the police?
No Mlle, leave me alone,
i've signed enough.
Listen, it's possibly to warn the
police so i'm not compromised.
You'll have to help me. Are you
prepared to commit robbery?
What is it you want?
Day 3
And now the news
The whole nation is watching Nice
after the mad sniper's 4th murder.
It was learned this morning that
Mlle Jocelyne Rocca was...
shot down as she was walking out
of police inpsector Carella's home.
It appears she went there
of her own free well to...
volunteer information
concering the mysterious killer.
Could the police
have found a lead?
Let's hope so because since
yesterday the town of Nice is...
living in terror wondering who
the sniper will chose next.
- What about the Forest girl?
- Busy rehearsing.
She has a part in a
play they're giving at...
the university,
the director is Palombo.
He's the drama coach there.
Let's go.
That's the 2nd time in 24 hours
someone's mentioned that university.
The first person was
Jocelyne yesterday.
It's where she knew Tony Forest,
Barroyer and our astrologer Kleinberg.
And today Sandra Forest
is supposed to be there.
It's interesting huh?
- Where's Doume?
- He stayed back at the precinct.
Mr Carella... may I sak you why
you keep washing your hands?
Sure, you may ask me about it.
So you will leave and
I will remember you.
Remember you, why should
memory bring such sadness?
- No stop.
- It's hard for me.
Shall we begin again?
It's not so bad but...
- Sandra, what is it?
- I'm not sure.
You're so uptight,
it's as if... well...
- Shall we begin again? - Oh
yes, there's time to begin again.
We're here to rehearse.
- Who wrote this play?
- The old phoney directing it.
- Is it a melodrama?
- No, a crapodrama!
Ok everyone, from the beginning.
- How about the title? - Doesn't
much matter he changes it so often.
What do you mean?
Palombo decided this time
the title would be Sandra but...
when he first did it way back,
some 8 or 10 years ago...
he called the play Juliette.
Juliette.
Juliette.
Juliette my darling, isn't it
time you went to the police?
They'd be interested
in what you have to say.
- Did you ever know Tony Forest?
- Yes I knew Tony Forest.
But as for the rest, it'd be
difficult to remember because...
i've had so many ex-students been
involved in my cultural studies.
Good morning gentlemen.
Mr Palombo, will you
need me any more today?
No, you may go Mlle Forest.
What courage she has.
She must've been
really upset after...
what happened but she agreed
to come over and rehearse.
Mr Palombo, we've been looking for
any possible clue in this affair.
If you know anything at all
now's the time to speak up.
But why, why me? What could...
Did you ever know... did
you ever know Jocelyne Rocca?
- Did you know her?
- Yes I knew her.
- And Hans Kleinberg, Kleinberg?
- Kleinberg, yes I knew both of them.
I'm going to ask you to come down
to police headquarters with us.
You'll have to rehearse the play
without me for the time being.
- I have to get my jacket.
- Go ahead, please.
Take him in, don't wait for me.
- What if I took you in?
- For what?
For illegally entering a
municipal building, robbery.
Who asked you to come here
and ransack this room?
Now look here Mlle Forest...
Just remember it wouldn't be the
first time you gave us a heads up.
I promised I
wouldn't say anything.
Promised someone
on TV possibly?
Possibly.
- Do you know the time for
that TV show? - About noon.
- Doume. - Ah yes I know
that voice, it's Carella.
- Yes. - Carella, you'd better take a motorcycle...
with the traffic at noon you can't
make it in time going in a car.
Go by motorcycle to
La Place Rossanti...
where they do 'The Mystery
Object' TV show, understand?
Do everything you can to get
there and protect Sabirnou.
- Know who that is?
- Yes, he's the MC.
- That's it.
- Protect Sabirnou...
even if you're shot in his
place, he must be protected.
- That's your assignment,
understand? - Why?
- Because he's next on
the list. - What list?
Hurry you fool, no hold on,
you'd better tell Di Bozzo...
it's very important he blocks
off the area as fast as he can.
Go!
You're always turning
up aren't you?
- Do you have idea who the
murderer might be? - No.
We'll stop the show for now.
Remember 'The Mystery Object Show'
is temporarily cancelled.
And now to remind
you of the clues:
The mystery object is
quite small, round...
it's something you can
purchase in a store...
and it's always
sombre in colour, sir.
Mr Sabirnou, the mystery object,
is it the black barrel of a rifle...
with which our unknown
friend means to kill us all?
Come now, let's try to
stick to the game sir.
We are very sorry for
the temporary interruption.
Let's have your papers.
Excuse me, could I please
have your attention.
Your honour, commissioner, assistant
commisioner, colonel, sir, Mlle.
This is the programme of
a play performed at...
the university of Nice's
cultural centre 8 years ago.
The first four amateur actors:
Antoine Forest, Pierre Barroyer,
Hans Kleinberg and Jocelyne Rocca...
Have all been murdered in the
order of their stage appearance...
which is, as you can see, how
they're listed in the programme.
It is therefore obvious that the fifth
victim should've been Julien Sabirnou.
He is now in protective
custody in this building.
Francis Palombo, who
wrote Juliette...
a somewhat innocuous work, a melodrama,
I spent a few hours reading it...
Francis Palombo is also here
undergoing interrogation.
As to the two other
persons on the program...
H�l�ne Vall�e and Juliette Vaudreuil,
we've begun a search to locate them.
The point is why, after
8 years have past...
does professor Palmobo suddenly
decide to revive his play?
This is the point on which Mr
Palombo is now being questioned...
and it's not been
answered satisfactorily.
In any case, there clearly
exists between these 8 people...
some event or events which has caused
someone to take this course of murder.
The two women could be
somewhat difficult to find.
The chances are they're
both now married...
and no longer living
under their maiden names.
However, we've sent
out search notices.
Don't underestimate the Paris police,
they're quite efficient you know.
I've every confidence
in Carella, excuse me.
Look, we already have four
corpses on our hands...
we can't afford
any more mistakes.
Carella, you're not making this
personal on account of Mlle Rocca?
Where are you going?
I'm going to see the parents
of Juliette Vaudreuil...
Di Boozo found out where they are.
Use the lead "Inspector Carella states
the murderer won't kill any more."
Yes, end quote, make
that the headline.
- Inspector Carella?
- Madam.
Helene Dumont.
- Excuse me I have to hurry.
- Helenee Dumont nnamed Vallee.
Helene Vallee.
What made you come to see me
Madam Vallee er Madam Dumont?
Don't you think he means to kill
everyone who was in that play?
- You know who the
killer is? - No.
I'm sorry inspector.
What have you been doing
all this time Madam Dumont?
Staying in St Tropez.
- And you got frightened I suppose?
- It frightened me yes...
I told my husband someone
certainly seems to be...
trying to kill everyone
who was in Juliette.
And what did your
husband say about it?
He seemed to think
I must be a fool.
His opinion was i'd be bothering
the police and you'd refuse to listen.
You did well to come
here Madam Dumont.
- Will you come with me?
- Alright.
You drive.
Wouldn't it be safer to put her
under protection with the others?
Sit in front.
Would it really bother you to answer
one of my questions just once?
You did the play and when
the performance was over...
you all went to have a
drink at Mr Palmobo's home.
That's right, as I remember
we got a bit drunk.
- Was Juliette Vaudreuil there?
- Oh yes, all of the girls were there.
Do you know if Juliette got married
since then or what's become of her?
No idea.
- Everybody have fun at
the party? - I'd imagine.
We all stayed there
the whole night...
but Palombo was tired and went
to bed early in the evening.
And did anything in
particular happen that night?
- We made love.
- Who exactly is we?
Everyone.
But did it begin...
naturally Madam Dumont?
I mean didn't
anyone even flirt?
With one exception I believe we had
all been intimate, but not in a group.
- And so?
- And so...
And so there were two to begin
and two more and then six.
Did you see each
other after the party?
We kept acquaintances, that is
of course not including Juliette.
It hadn't been
pleasant for her...
so we thought she'd most
probably drop out because...
they forced her
to drink so much.
- Who's they?
- The guys.
- And the boys forced her.
- Forced or raped?
- Raped.
- You too?
Me? No, nobody raped me.
- And what were you doing?
- Nothing.
I watched it.
Helene Vallee made a confession
about your little orgy.
What stopped you
telling me about it?
It's something one
doesn't care to discuss.
I've tried to
forget what happened...
But it haunts me...
i'm sick about it.
You were ashamed so you
had to get rid of them.
You were afraid the whole world
would find out your secrets so...
the witnesses had
to be eliminated.
You're a fool.
I didn't murder anyone.
I'm not capable, I
couldn't pull the trigger.
We found a gun at your bedside and
you couldn't fire a gun you say.
- I'm just a collecter.
- It had shells in it.
You kept it on your
night table, why?
- Go on.
- For protection.
- You know who did it? - No, really.
It was only after Forest and Barroyer
were murdered that I began to think...
and then there was Kleinberg
and I knew what it meant.
You should've come here sooner
for you own protection.
I suppose so, but there
was a scandal, my career...
You preferred worrying about your career
and not about getting yourself murdered?
After 8 years you decide to
perform your play again...
you get Forest's stepdaughter
to play the lead... why?
It's a coincidence, accident.
And is this a coincidence? We
found this photo in your apartment.
Do you recognise her?
Oh yes, it's Juliette Vaudreuil.
And this is Sandra Forest, don't
you think there's a resemblence?
When I saw Sandra Forest in the
library I couldn't believe it.
I'd written the
play for Juliette.
I loved Juliette, in a platonic
way, but after that night...
I swore i'd never perform
that silly play again but...
seeing Sandra was
just too much for me.
Mr Palombo, 3 questions:
Do you think there's
a connection between...
these murders and the
reproduction of your play?
If not please explain why nothing of
this sort happened before this year.
Is Juliette Vaudreuil
capable of shooting a gun?
Don't ask me.
Once before this she put
herself under a long treatment.
I'm the one who told
her to go to the clinic.
Yes, we know.
Very upset, suffered a
somatic trauma I believe.
Yes, it was somatic
and psychological.
Juliette my darling, i'm awfully
sorry to have to insist but...
I do think it would be
best to go to the police.
Yes Juliette.
You're in grave danger darling and
i'm certain they'd be interested.
They'd expect me
to tell and I can't.
Well, you won't tell
them a single thing.
- But they'll protect you. - But I
don't go anywhere, there's no risk.
You go out seldom but...
there's still a chance the
murderer will seek you out.
They couldn't really hurt
me because you'd be there.
Perry?
You're right.
Yes of course.
I'd protect you.
Day 4
Reporters, photographers
and curious onlookers...
waited on for hours in vain in front
of Nice police headquarters last night.
No new clues or information
have been reported...
after a long night of interrogations
by inspector Carella and his men.
This morning, Nice waits
out this horror of blood...
continuing to ask
unanswered questions.
- That new stuff?
- No, just routine.
It's a homicide report
from the Saint-Jouin police.
The body of an old man.
He was a street cleaner found
on a jetty near the main harbour.
Ok, see if you can get
me more details on it.
At the moment, all
dead bodies interest me.
It's nothing but
a poor old man.
It appears he'd
been strangled.
The doctor set the time at
about 4 yesterday afternoon.
No trace of any sort
of long rifle, nothing.
The man couldn't have
anything to do with our case.
Your suspects are here now, are
you ready to interrogate them?
Good morning to you sir.
Oh pardon me Carella, I
meant to say good morning.
Why should anyone have
killed a poor old man?
What if he was a
witness to something?
There is a theory...
but you have 3 witnesses to
question and that's not just theory.
Palombo's the only one who interests
me, none of his arguments hold up.
Well begin with him then.
I thought you were able
to make anybody talk.
Nevertheless maybe we ought to have
something more on this new murder.
Would you please connect
me with inspector Carella.
Oh no we don't know
each other at all.
My name's Perry Rupert-Foote,
i'm a British subject...
and i'm also married
to Juliette Vaudreuil.
She needs protection i'm afraid.
Right, that's it.
Oh no she'd never leave,
can't you come?
It's the Hotel Regina, Parc Signere,
apartment 296, use the stairs.
Inspector, one last thing, one
should be very gentle with my wife.
She's very fragile.
My wife will be with
you in just a second.
- May I please wash
my hands? - Of course.
There.
- May I?
- Please do.
Sir...
You will look after her?
Count on me Mr Rupert-Foote, we
will look after her extremely well.
Stop here Doume.
May I ask how long it's been since
you made love to your husband madam?
Or maybe you two have
never made love at all.
But he worships you so
he wanted to avenge you.
He wanted to wash away the
insult, wash away the stain.
So he started to
get rid of them...
one after the other, with
or without your approval.
But you were aware of
something weren't you?
You must've suspected something.
Well am I on the right
track madam Rupert-Foote?
I asked you am I on the right
track madam Rupert-Foote?
You can't make me stay here.
- Here, this will save my going back.
- I was hoping you wouldn't leave it.
For you the case is a success,
for me it's been a disaster.
I couldn't return.
Carella, look at this, this is what
we found in the streets we scoured.
Juliette's husband was the one
who strangled him, you were right.
Well, doesn't that make you
feel like staying with us?
Goodbye sir.
