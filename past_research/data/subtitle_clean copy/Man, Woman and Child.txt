"Something there is in
the float of the sight of things
"That provokes it
out of the soul
"Now I re-examine
philosophies and religions
"They may prove well in
lecture-rooms
"yet not prove at all under the
spacious clouds and along the landscape
"and flowing currents."
I think Walt Whitman's trying to tell us
something here, like maybe we should hold our
class outdoors, or maybe we shouldn't
hold it at all.
Now before we get into
the elegy on Lincoln,
I thought it might be a good
idea for us to first review
a little bit of the activity that Mr.
Whitman was up to during the Civil War.
Yeah. Professor Beckwith, didn't
he try to buy his brother out
of serving in the army?
Yeah, and wasn't his older brother,
George, wounded during the war?
Yeah, George was wounded at Fredericksburg,
that's why he went to Washington…
I think that might be a little
bit of a cop-out then…
He's obviously an egomaniac. He wrote
his own reviews for crying out loud.
Wait a minute, calm down.
Just a minute.
Now, I find this really
fascinating,
that here we are,
fighting amongst ourselves,
and defending
one position and another
on the man's personal life!
And not a word, not one
phrase, not one reference,
to any individual work
that he did.
The important thing is what the man stood
for, and that's reflected in his work.
Daddy!
Hello, darling.
Climb up here and give
Daddy a kiss.
That a girl. Boy, you're
getting heavy.
You make your dentist
appointment today?
Yep.
Let's have a look.
Very good, then.
Guess what?
What? Jessica
kissed a boy today.
Uh-oh.
Really? All of them are? Everyone?
I just hate them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello, darling.
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you, Jess?
Hi, Dad, I'm fine.
What are you guys talking about?
Oh, Jessie was lamenting the quality
of the opposite sex at school.
Well, lack of it, actually. Oh, yeah?
That's not what I heard, red.
Oh, and by the way, I found this
bag of trash in the living room.
Where should I put it? Down the drain.
Like that one.
What's for supper?
We are having hamburger with blue
cheese from The New York Times.
Mom, it's a 60-minute gourmet…
Where's Paula? What are
you doing under there?
Daddy.
…two tablespoons,
you need to chop this…
Do you want a glass of wine?
I would love that.
Okay, I need… PAULA:
I'll have what I want.
How'd it go with Larry, honey?
Well, the university board is determined
to cut down my Humanities department.
What does that mean?
It means they wanna drop
nine of our people.
What? You're kidding.
Nine? Oh, for God's sake.
That's what I said.
What are you going to do?
Try and set up a meeting tomorrow night
with some of the other chairmen.
You know who could help you? Steve Nichols.
I already thought of that.
His wife is one of the trustees.
We'll need all the help
we can get.
I'm sorry. God.
Oh, no, it's not me,
it's our friends.
I know, but it's awful.
Come on, guys,
cut it out, will you, please?
It's not fair, Mom! Oh, shut up…
Now, listen, I've got some
good news for you, at least.
What's up?
We nailed Gavin Wilson's new
book for the university press!
Hey! Congratulations.
That's a real coup, isn't it?
Oh, God, was I relieved.
Good for you.
Butter, please.
Did Mom tell you about my plan?
What plan?
About Europe.
What about it?
I'd like to go.
I'm sure you would someday.
I mean this summer. You know,
one of Garber's teenage tours.
She's not a teenager yet.
Oh, Daddy, don't be punctilious.
I'm old enough to go.
You're only 12 and a half.
Shut up, birdbrain.
Come on, you guys.
What's your rush, Jessica? Why
can't you wait another year?
I refuse to spend another boring
summer with Grandma in her…
…Cape Cod.
Bourgeois Cape Cod?
Yeah. So what if there's
nuclear war?
I could die without ever
seeing the Louvre.
Why don't you write a letter to
the President and the politburo,
and maybe they'll make an extra effort
to keep things quiet for another year.
Daddy, you're not
taking me seriously.
Daddy's saying no.
No, he isn't.
He hasn't said yes.
He's saying maybe.
Meaning?
Meaning I'll discuss it
with your mother.
I forgot to tell you Louis Montcourage
called today from France.
Really, what did he want?
Should I call him back?
No, no, he's on his way
to the country,
but he says he will call you
tomorrow at 4:00.
I said at school.
Our time.
Remember, you promised no lectures
this summer. Huh? Didn't he?
Yeah, you promised.
You promised.
I know that. Maybe I'm up
for a Legion of Honor.
If she goes to Europe,
can I go to Asia?
You're not going to go to Asia,
'cause you pick your nose.
What's wrong with that,
you never pick your nose?
No! That's a disgusting thing.
I do not pick my nose.
You mean you don't
get caught at it.
I think the picking of one's nose is
a good and healthy thing, don't you?
Would you like some cake?
Here you go, kid, take a break.
Oh, thanks, honey.
I got us all set up at Doug's
for tomorrow night at 6:30.
Yeah? 6:30,
what about dinner?
Cathy's going to make a buffet.
Oh, that's nice, it'll
be like a little party.
Let's hope it's not a going-away party.
Nah, come on.
How does Wilson read? God, he
is a good writer, you know,
but some of this prose has got more
starch in it than our laundry.
Well, if all those guys
wrote like Adlai Stevenson,
you'd be unemployed right now.
True.
Okay, just a minute. Look, I've got one
more paragraph, I've got to get…
Oh, what is she…
…finished. Oh, boy.
You know, I missed you today.
Did you?
What a coincidence.
I'm gonna have to drop the Shakespeare
course next term, Professor Beckwith.
Yeah, Professor Curtis told me that,
that's why I wanted to see you.
What is there,
a scheduling problem?
No, I'm a physics major.
Yeah, I know, but you were
a physics major
when you registered
for the course, right?
Yeah. To tell you the truth,
I don't want to have to compete
with mostly English majors.
Compete for what?
Grades. I've got
to be realistic.
If I'm going to land a job
in nuclear research,
I've got to have
a straight-A average.
Is there no other reason?
Look, I've always enjoyed the
little Shakespeare I've read,
that's why I considered
taking the course,
but I just afford to risk
a below-A grade.
Yeah, I understand.
Now tell me, just how much
Shakespeare have you read?
A little.
I played Horatio
in Hamlet in high school.
Did you?
Yes.
Did you retain any of the lines?
Yeah. No.
"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
"the graves stood tenantless
"and the sheeted dead did squeak and
gibber in the Roman streets as stars with
"trains of fire and dews
of blood."
That's all I can remember.
That's marvelous.
It's embarrassing I can't
remember anymore.
Not at all. You know what
I'm going to do, Mr. Ryan?
I'm going to guarantee you
an A in this course right now
if you'll simply promise to attend
it, relax and enjoy. How'd that be?
Are you serious?
I'm very serious.
What about Professor Curtis?
I'm just going to tell him
to give you an A.
Well, what excuse
would you make?
That I will personally feel a hell of a lot
safer knowing there's a physicist out there
who's read some Shakespeare.
Excuse me. And I
think you'll be happier, too.
- Hello.
- Professor Beckwith?
Yes, speaking. WOMAN: You
have a call from Paris.
All right, I'll hang on.
Simply the thing I am
shall make me live.
Shakespeare. Congratulations, you've
just got an A on your first test.
Thanks.
If I knew I was going to perform
Shakespeare, I would have worn my tights.
I'll tell Professor Curtis
to expect you.
Thanks. Thank you.
Good luck!
Hello?
Yes, hello!
Is that you, Bob?
Louis! Ca va?
Fine.
Good, good.
How is Simone?
Simone is well, thank you.
Louis?
I'm here.
Oh! I thought
we got cut off.
No.
Bob, do you remember
Nicole Guerin?
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Gosh, we're late, you know.
We're running behind.
I got behind.
How'd it go today?
Hmm?
Where are the kids?
They're having dinner with Stephanie.
Nora's going to bring them home later on.
You gonna change? Hmm?
No.
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
No.
A problem at school?
No.
Well, will you tell me? You're
scaring me, for God's sake.
Okay, relax.
What's the matter?
Please sit down.
What?
Um…
Do you remember the first time
I went to France alone?
You know, that time I went to
lecture on Baudelaire and Poe.
Well sort of. That's a
very long time ago…
It was 10 years ago. You
were pregnant with Paula.
Yeah, right, I remember.
I had an affair.
In France, 10 years ago?
Why are you telling me now?
Is this some sort of
a joke or something?
No, it's not joke.
It's the truth.
Is this somebody I know?
No.
Well, who was it?
Her name was Nicole Guerin.
She was the doctor
that looked after me.
Um, well, how long did it last?
I don't remember.
Two or three days.
Well, which was it,
two or three days?
Does it matter?
Yeah, actually,
everything matters.
Why didn't you
tell me this before?
Because I didn't want
to hurt you.
You want to hurt me now?
Good God, no, Sheila.
I mean…
Are you gonna run away with this
woman, is that what you're telling me?
No, I haven't seen her
in 10 years.
She was killed in an
accident a few days ago.
That's why Louis was calling.
I don't get this.
What…
You must have a reason
for telling me this now.
Yes, I do.
Darling, she had a son.
Yeah?
My son.
I'm the boy's father, Sheila.
Oh, Jesus.
What makes you
think that it's your son?
Louis was her closest friend.
He's absolutely certain.
I know that you're angry and
you have every right to be,
but it doesn't change the fact.
Why didn't he tell you before?
Because she made him
promise not to.
She knew I was married
and had kids.
Listen, Sheila,
if it's any consolation
to you, I swear to God,
it's the only time
I've ever been unfaithful.
I haven't seen her in 10 years. I
never wrote her or called her.
Had no contact whatsoever.
What else did Louis tell you?
That the boy has no other family, and
that he and Simone would look after him.
Good, they'll make
great parents.
Let's get out of here,
I'm getting out of here.
I'm the boy's father! I don't
want to hear about it!
I hope you started without us.
Did you think we'd start without
our best and our brightest?
Go on in.
Sheila!
Hello! Hi!
Nice to see you!
Could you help me with this? Hello, Betty.
How you doing?
Hi, Betty. How are you?
Robinson? Hi.
Hi.
What do you got? I need a drink.
I'd like a vodka, straight.
Please.
I don't think you've met
the Dolans.
Listen, I really appreciate
your help on this.
You got a problem?
We'll stick together.
Glass of wine?
No.
What's she having?
Vodka straight.
I'll have the same, please.
Okay.
You know, I feel awful that we
haven't gotten together before this.
Oh, don't.
Maybe just not interested
in history.
Oh, no, no. I am.
Especially, uh, French.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, we have some distant
relatives in France.
Thanks.
Sheila!
Marsh! Marsh!
Congratulations!
Oh, thank you.
I hear you're editing
Gavin Wilson's new book.
Yes.
Hello, Bob!
This is our friend,
Marcia Whorl.
The Dolans.
Hi.
We played tennis two years ago.
Yeah.
Doubles, right? You lost.
Yeah.
The way I understand, what you're
looking for is a consensus, right?
Yeah, that's about it.
I'll tell you, if this were Cambridge
rather than here in Los Angeles,
we wouldn't be
having this problem.
Don't kid yourself, Richard, they
got the same problems at Cambridge.
They got the same problems in every
institute of higher learning
in this country, I promise you.
The way I see it,
we have two alternatives.
We're gonna have to capitulate
or we can threaten to resign.
I thought we were here to
save others' jobs, not to lose ours.
He's right. Then
I suggest we all leave.
Are you serious?
I'm very serious.
Because if we cave in now,
we're finished anyway.
They'll keep hacking away
at our departments
until this university won't have
a Humanities left in the end.
Gentlemen, couldn't we eat now and
save the Humanities after dinner?
Hear, hear!
What's his name?
Who?
Your son.
Jean-Claude.
I just wish I could
make this up to you.
I don't think you can.
Hey, come on, hon.
You're not gonna let this shatter
our whole relationship, are you?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
Christ, I wish
I hadn't told you.
Why did you tell me, Robert?
I don't know.
You do, God damn it, you do.
It's the child.
You didn't want it.
You certainly
didn't plan for it,
but now that you've got it, you
feel responsible, don't you?
I just feel I ought
to do something.
You're not his parent because
you screwed his mother.
I know that, Sheila.
I just think I should go over
there and see him. Talk to him.
And say what?
I don't know.
Let him know there's somebody else in the
world that cares about him, I guess.
I don't want you going. I don't
want you going back to France now.
I've gotta go, Sheila.
There's no other way.
Yes, there is.
You could bring him here.
What do you mean?
Let him spend
Easter vacation with us.
Do you know what you're saying?
It isn't generosity, Robert.
It's self-defense.
If I don't let you get this out
of your system sooner or later,
you'll blame me for something or
other having to do with your son.
I wouldn't do that, Sheila.
Oh, yes, you would.
You would.
Maybe you're right.
I'll bring him over, then.
It's an extraordinary offer. I
really appreciate it, Sheila.
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't talk about it anymore.
We're going to have to manufacture
something to tell the girls.
I don't like the idea
of lying to them.
Should have thought of that
10 years ago.
You look awful, Daddy.
Yeah, well, I just found out
a friend of mine died.
What friend?
Oh, you never met her.
How come?
If she's a friend…
Well, she lived in France.
I didn't know her either, honey.
Daddy meets a lot of
people when he lectures.
I'm sorry she died.
I am, too.
She had a son.
How old?
Roughly about Paula's age,
I guess.
And, now he's an orphan.
Your mother and I
were thinking that
it'd be a good idea for us to invite him
over here to spend Easter vacation with us.
What do you think?
Sure, it's fine with me.
Good idea.
What's his name?
Jean-Claude.
Jean-Claude Guerin.
Does he speak English?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Sounds like I'll be able to…
To prepare for the summer.
We haven't decided
on that yet, young lady.
Take your vitamins. Come on.
Is he cute, Daddy?
I don't know that either,
I've never seen him.
Hi, could you tell me what time Flight
891 gets in from Paris, please?
891 from Paris?
891 will arrive
on time at 4:15.
4:15?
Yes, sir.
So I'm an hour early.
Mmm-hmm.
And where will it come in?
You can meet the passengers
in the customs area upstairs.
Oh, okay. Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
What could be more appropriate?
Baudelaire knew France and the French
character better than most of our poets.
Your lecture was magnifique.
A day the Sorbonne
will never forget.
I wish you'd gone on
for another hour.
The faculty loved it.
Boy, I'll tell you, Louis, you are
one charming Gallic bullshitter.
No, I'm serious.
Watch out, Louis!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right, Bobby?
Oh, my God, you're hurt.
I must get you to a doctor.
Look up, please.
May I ask what you're doing now?
Just checking
your pupillary reflexes.
It's good of you to see
my colleague, Nicole.
No thanks are necessary.
It's my job.
Am I gonna live, doctor?
A rule about accident victims is
if they can ask silly questions,
then it's not too serious.
Thank God, I can take him home.
Simone will be delighted.
Louis, I think
Professor Beckwith
should stay a while so that
I can take some X-rays.
X-rays? Oh, my God.
He wouldn't be here if I hadn't
persuaded him to come and lecture.
Louis, one patient
at a time is enough.
Now, you go home
and I'll bring him when we
have finished, all right?
Maybe I should stay.
No, no, no.
Don't keep Simone waiting.
I'll be all right.
Look, Bobby, you don't have
to worry about a thing.
You couldn't be in better hands.
Nicole is the best doctor
in all of Normandy.
Don't forget, he has to be
in shape for my seminar
at the Sorbonne on Tuesday.
No problems.
If necessary, I will give
him a brain transplant.
Hey, it's your jacket.
Oh…
See you later, Bobby.
Poor guy is a nervous wreck.
He's a very special person.
Yes, he is.
Take this, please.
What are they?
Aspirin.
Oh, yes. Now I know
you're a real doctor.
Are my brains still intact?
I'm not a psychiatrist.
But I don't see
any signs of fracture.
As you say in America,
you just shook up.
Where did you learn
your English?
I did a year internship
at Boston General.
I almost stayed on.
What brought you back?
Honfleur.
Do you know it?
No.
All I've seen in France so far
is the inside of a lecture hall.
Then you'll go back
to Los Angeles without
experiencing the lovely village
where Baudelaire
wrote Le Voyage?
I'm afraid so.
I can't allow that.
Now I understand why so many
impressionists came here to paint.
Yes.
It took only one year
working in a Paris clinic
to convince me that
this is where I belong.
You seem very happy here.
Since I live
by my own definitions,
I can say
I'm a very happy woman.
What is that song?
It's called Plaisirs d'Amour.
It's a lovely old song.
Maybe as old as this village.
It's about the joy
and sorrow of love.
What is your favorite
poem by Baudelaire?
Les Fleurs du Mal.
What do you like most
about Baudelaire's work?
Love.
Mmm.
Ah, oui.
The hopeless romantic.
But he never surrendered to it.
He believed that
no human relations
are adequate to human desires.
You ever been married?
No.
I don't think marriage
is for everyone.
I enjoy being independent
too much.
That doesn't mean
necessarily being lonely.
What about your family?
I lost my family
when I was little.
Louis and Simone
practically raised me.
Now I can understand the
importance of your independence.
Now who's playing doctor?
Actually, you may be right.
I have a tendency to use my
studies and my patients as…
As a shield against
personal relationships?
Perhaps.
That could change.
I mean, someday you
might even want children.
Oh, but I've thought of it.
And I will.
If I find somebody I like
enough to make a child with.
Come on, come on, quick.
Oh!
God, the water looks inviting.
It does.
Why don't we go for a swim?
You mean now?
Yes.
Flight 891 from
Paris is now arriving at Gate 35.
Incoming passengers may be
met at the customs area.
Mr. Collins?
Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins?
Excuse me, pardon me.
Tommy, how are ya?
How was he?
He's a wonderful boy.
Was he? Good, thank
you very much.
Joanne Hall, please pick up
the white courtesy phone. Joanne Hall.
Professor Beckwith?
Professor Beckwith?
Professor Beckwith?
Here.
Here's your little passenger.
Bonjour, Jean-Claude,
je suis Bob Beckwith.
Au revoir.
He was a very good passenger.
Merci, Madame, merci beaucoup.
You are very welcome.
Au revoir, Madame.
Au revoir.
Do you prefer parler
francais ou anglais?
Whatever you like.
Well, I'm sure you speak English
better than I speak French,
so we'll speak English, okay?
All right.
I'm very sorry to hear
about your mother.
Thank you.
Is this all your luggage?
Yes.
Should we go?
So, welcome to America.
Thank you.
How are Louis and Simone?
Very well, Monsieur Beckwith.
Why don't you just call me Bob?
All right, Bob.
You take this.
You take Fuzzy Wuzzy.
I'm not taking the rat!
Fuzzy Wuzzy's not a rat,
he's a hamster!
Well, whatever he is, he's
sleeping by your side of the bed.
Why do I have to move,
and not Jessie?
Well, Mom, I don't
want her in my room.
Will you stop being so selfish?
It's for two weeks.
Come on, remember,
he's an orphan.
Is he gonna feel better in my
room than Jessie's?
It's easier to move you.
Yeah, because I have less things,
because Jessie gets everything…
Come on…
Jean-Claude.
Jean-Claude.
We're here.
Ladies, may I
present Jean-Claude Guerin.
Jean-Claude,
this is my wife, Sheila.
My daughters, Jessica and Paula.
Hi.
Hello.
Jean-Claude, we're very
happy to have you with us.
I'm happy to be here.
Good.
Jean-Claude, je suis Jessica.
What? I think he said
you're blue in the face.
Your French is excellent.
Really, vraiment?
Absolument.
How long did it take from Paris?
It was 10 hours.
Wow.
Oh, I have something.
Ah! Thank you!
Oh, look girls. See?
That's hand written.
It was given
to my mother by a patient.
That's very kind of you, Jean-Claude.
You must be very tired.
Yeah, he fell asleep in the car.
Come on, Jean-Claude.
I'll take you to your room.
Good night.
I'll do it. Huh?
Okay?
Goodnight
He's cute.
You think?
Why's his English so good? He
told me he had a private tutor.
Why, is he noble or something?
No. In fact, his mother
was a country doctor.
Wow.
What was his father?
I don't know, but I
know he wasn't noble.
Now, if you'll give me your
key, I'll unpack for you.
No, thank you,
I can do it myself.
Well, um…
All of these drawers
are empty here.
This is the bathroom. You'll have
to share that with the girls.
Thank you.
I can't sleep without Hippo.
Do you like him? Yes, I
have a whale like that.
I'll show you later.
That's neat.
Come, Jean-Claude is tired.
If you need anything else, we'll
be downstairs, all right?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Who's there?
Jean-Claude, what are you
doing down here?
Couldn't sleep, huh?
No.
May I join you?
That's fine.
Are you cold?
No.
You want a glass of milk
or something?
You're very homesick,
aren't you?
You come from a lovely
village, you know.
Do you know it?
Yes.
I was there once,
many years ago.
Is that where you met my mother?
Yes.
She was a very nice lady.
She was a very good doctor.
Yes, I know that.
Did you know my father?
Did you, Bob?
What did your mother
tell you about him?
That he was married
to someone else.
And?
They loved each other
and decided to have me.
But of course, he could
not stay in France.
Did, uh, your mother ever
tell you who he was?
No,
but I think perhaps
it was an Englishman.
Why do you think that?
Because if he was Italian,
I think she would have
made me learn Italian.
I think you're right.
Jean-Claude…
You just suffered
a very great loss,
and you have
a very, very deep pain.
But I want you to know
you're not alone.
You have Louis and Simone
in France,
and you have me, here.
I want you to know that
you can always count on me,
and I want us to be friends.
I think I'm sleepy now.
Magnifique, very good.
Pardon, I prefer coffee.
Really?
Oh, of course.
I should have asked.
I'll have some coffee, too.
Me, too.
No, you won't.
Why not?
Because I don't approve
of children having coffee.
But his mother was a doctor.
I know.
It's an honest
difference of opinion.
Why don't you just give
him some coffee, Sheila?
That's why I stood up,
Robert, to get him a cup.
I still don't know why
I can't have any coffee.
Because I said no.
And he can because
his mother said yes.
What would you like in it,
Jean-Claude?
It's all right,
I'll have the milk.
Okay,
okay, okay, okay.
You're gonna like our friend Bernie.
He's a lot of fun.
Bernie Edwards
is a crashing bore.
Come on, Jessica.
He's my oldest friend.
All he ever talks about is sports,
and how great his son Davey is.
So he's a sports man?
No, no, he's a lawyer, but most of
his clients are big-league athletes.
You know, like baseball,
basketball, football.
Football?
The American version
of breaking empty heads.
Anyway, he has this big barbeque
every year around Easter time.
That's where we're going.
One on one, Richard.
George, let me see your dunk.
Let me see your dunk.
Okay, let him shoot,
let him shoot.
All right, that's it, that's it.
Hey, Barbara.
Hey, Barbara.
Come on, Christians,
let's meet the gladiators.
Hey, hey, hey, Bernie!
Let's see that ball.
Hey, right here! Whoa.
Homer! Try and stop this.
Are you ready?
Get in there.
Whoo!
Give up? Homer, you might
make the team this year.
How are ya, Bernie?
Hey, Bob. How are ya?
Happy Easter.
Hey, same to you.
Hey, Uncle Bob!
Hey, Davey!
Oh, this is Jean-Claude Guerin.
Hey, the French kid you've
been talking about, right?
Yeah. Jean-Claude, this is
Bernie and his son, David.
Does he play any
touch football, Bob?
Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry Bernie,
but, you know, in some areas, the
French are culturally deprived.
Oh, yeah, I understand that.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
Hey, Homer, teach
Jean-Claude how to play.
Hey, Ned. See you
later, Jean-Claude.
Easy.
I'm telling you, there are some All-Americans
down there. Did you see Davey?
I mean, he was
playing with them, Bob.
Yeah, I saw him. Did you see
that 20-footer he made?
Uh-huh.
Huh?
So you've been giving the dean a little
trouble here this week, haven't you?
I'm doing my best.
Yeah, I know, Bob, but I
think you gotta understand,
see, this is recruiting week now.
We got some kids coming in here
that can pay your salary
for the next four years, okay?
I'm not worried about my salary,
I'm worried about what I teach.
Bob,
the university needs
a seven-foot center.
Well, with all this room,
Bernie, maybe you can grow one.
Hey, Nance.
Hi, can I steal her away?
Yeah, sure.
Champagne?
Yes, yes, I…
You know, you look terrific,
you lucky thing. Do I?
Yes, you do. Is it
overwork or the Scarsdale?
Honey, I keep telling ya, it's
in the genes. This I know.
Oh…
Sheila, do not leave without
signing that petition.
It's on Bernie's desk
in his study.
Okay, all right,
now what am I signing?
The seals again, they're being butchered
in Canada. It's easy to remember.
Easter time, it's the seals. Right,
right, Easter, the seals, okay.
Okay. I'm going to
say hello to Lorraine, honey.
See you later. Bye.
Have fun.
Lorraine!
Oh, hello, Sheila.
Oh, I got lipstick on you, sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
What are you two talking about?
Well, I've been
practicing my French.
This is an absolutely
charming child.
Isn't he?
I know, I know, but…
You know, actually, Lorraine,
I think Jean-Claude should
practice his English, don't you?
Jessie, so do you want to go to
the movies some day this week?
The name is Jessica and I
don't go out with juveniles.
I'm 14 months
older than you are.
Anyway, I'm just gonna be
a superstar athlete.
I couldn't care less.
What sport?
Soccer.
My dad says it's gonna be real big in the
'80s, and I can kick with both feet.
Not at the same time, I assume.
Very funny. So, uh, who's
that shrimp with you?
He's not a shrimp. His name is Jean-Claude.
Guest from France.
He comes from a very important family.
Big deal.
And I plan to return the visit
when I go to Europe this summer.
Are you really going?
What?
Look it up, stupid.
Dad. Daddy, are you all right?
Sorry, Mr. Beckwith.
Oh, Daddy.
Bob, are you okay?
Yeah, I twisted my knee. You'd
better bring in another guy, Bernie.
All right. Bob, ain't that
kid something, though, huh?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, love.
Why don't you get me some ice?
Okay.
Is he allowed to do that, Bob?
No.
Oh, Dad. Daddy's all
right, sweetheart.
Aren't you glad I'm a professor
and not a professional
football player?
Down six points, let's go.
How's your knee? ROBERT: Not bad.
In here, anyway.
Serves me right.
I'm not in shape.
Nobody's in shape for an insanely
competitive 15-year-old.
Do you think anybody
suspected today?
I don't know.
You know, people sense things.
I know I do.
I really couldn't care less.
Oh, you wouldn't have minded telling
everybody today, would you?
Why not? I'm not ashamed of it.
Hmm.
Tell me about her, Robert.
Come on, Sheila, she's dead
and gone, what's the point?
I wanna know.
I wanna hear about her.
I do, really, listen,
I can handle it. Trust me.
Just tell me about her.
I don't want
to hurt you, Sheila.
Oh, honey, you can't
hurt me. It's me.
It's Sheila. I'm a big girl.
Just tell me.
Why do you wanna know?
If I had an affair with someone and had a
child with them, wouldn't you wanna know?
Hmm?
Yeah, I guess I would.
Yeah, of course you would.
Come on, sweetheart, just feel
loose, get comfortable. Tell me.
Tell me about her. Trust me.
Well…
She was, uh… You know…
Very independent.
I would say uniquely independent.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
She lived by her own rules.
Yeah?
She had integrity. Great integrity.
Uh-huh. Integrity.
I was alone in France.
It was a beautiful summer.
Beaches were gorgeous.
I wanna hear about her,
not a damn travelogue.
Just tell me, will you,
please? Come on.
I mean, what was
she like physically?
She was very attractive, Sheila.
Yeah?
Exciting?
Yes, she was beautiful, Sheila.
And a good body?
Yes, she was beautiful, Sheila.
Yeah? It was inferred.
She was fantastic, she was the most
incredible, gorgeous, voluptuous creature
I've ever seen in my life.
God damn it!
Yeah, that's why I went to
France and divorced you
10 years ago,
so I could be with her!
Well, she was
uniquely independent.
Yes. She was uniquely
independent!
And don't forget about
her wonderful integrity.
Uniquely independent!
Great integrity!
Oh, shush. Be quiet. The
children, you'll wake them up.
"Trust me."
Shit.
He didn't tell me, Margo.
I mean what is that?
A marriage that has been
open and honest,
people who have been
as close as we are,
I really thought we had the best
marriage of anybody I knew.
You do.
Oh, yeah, we do, huh?
Look, I've been married
and divorced three times.
Nowadays, one affair in 10 years?
Why, that's absolute celibacy.
You know what I found out? I'm not a nowadays
person, Margo. I thought that I was.
You know what goes on out there?
I mean, I was a 22-year-old virgin
when I got married, for God's sake.
I was too, I think.
What do you mean, you think?
Well, all my sex has blurred.
I mean, I must have been a virgin at
some time. Why not when I got married?
I know I was a virgin for practically
a year before I got divorced,
that I know for sure!
Did I really think that we would go through
40 or 50 years of being completely
faithful to each other?
What's the matter with me?
I mean what a really modern woman would
say is this is none of my business…
I mean, it really has to…
Don't do this to yourself…
Or the marriage!
It was a funny time. You
were pregnant, he was away.
He was in France,
for heaven's sake.
I mean, the wine, the romance.
I know, the beaches, the moon, don't
give me a travelogue, please.
All he did was have an affair.
That's all that happened, right?
It's not all that happened, Margo,
he had a son with her. What?
Yes, he had a son. I couldn't even
bring myself to tell you before…
He's here with us. We brought
him here for Easter vacation.
Their child…
Yes, their child.
…is in your home?
Yes.
Oh, come on!
I mean, what are you,
a candidate for sainthood?
Look, I'm not a saint,
I'm scared.
You know, I'm afraid
of losing what I have.
If I didn't let him bring him here, it
would be a cloud over us forever, you know?
What do the girls think? I don't
know, they think he's cute.
They don't know who he is.
Is he?
I don't know.
Well, don't you look at him?
As little as possible.
When I do, all I see is her and
the son I could never give him.
I think I'd kill Bob
if I were you.
You know, I would like to kill
him sometimes, I really would.
The rest of the time I feel I need him more
than ever. I don't know. I don't know.
I think what you need now
is a drink.
I know I need one. Let's get out of here.
I would love a drink.
I have to meet
Gavin Wilson. I'm late.
You need some company?
Since when are you
interested in detente?
I never stop thinking about it.
Another time.
I envy you.
Why?
I wish I could love any man
as much as you love Bob.
See ya.
Oh, yeah.
Bob, I can't believe this, I mean you
and Sheila, like the perfect couple,
like those figures on a wedding cake.
What made you do it?
I wanted to talk to you about
what's happening now, Bernie,
not what happened 10 years ago.
Well, she must have been something for
you to… I mean, Sheila, my God.
I mean, were you
in love with her?
I don't know.
Maybe I was at the time.
Got a picture of her?
Oh, for Christ sake, Bernie, look at
the boy, she looked a lot like him.
Oh… I, I couldn't do it.
Something like that with Nancy.
God forbid, know what I mean?
She'd get me in court,
I'd get on the stand.
She'd talk about my income tax.
That tax shelter in Colorado.
God forbid.
Now, Bo Derek, if Bo Derek liked
me, then I'd maybe consider…
Hey, the knee's better, huh, Bob?
Yeah, a whole lot, Bernie!
Yeah, it's good.
It's good.
I very much like your suggestion of
changing the order of some of the chapters.
I think that's excellent.
Oh, good.
So, we've agreed that you'll rewrite the
material which you printed as conjecture
when you started the book three years ago,
now that it's an indisputable fact, huh?
Yeah, did you make any particular notes
on that? I did, here and here…
You really did do your
homework, didn't you?
Uh, and you'll rewrite the new introduction
taking the new facts into account, will you?
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I'll do an exchange with you.
Why don't you
have a look at that?
Well, you've started
this already!
Why did you make me go through my song
and dance? Because I like the music.
Are there any other problems you gonna
throw at me here? I have very little.
Just one general impression.
I think in the section on arms limitation,
you're a bit on shaky ground when you use
the word ideology.
You think it's a bit too Marxist
for the university press, do you?
Well, I don't know.
I don't mind. It's only a sub heading.
You got any ideas?
Well, I was thinking something
like "The Spirit of Salt One"
or "The Spirit
of Vladivostok."
Perhaps.
Okay. Fine.
All right.
Would you like a drink?
I have a long drive.
Uh, a soft drink? Really,
I'd better get going.
I am trying to delay your departure.
You do realize that, I hope.
Is that what you're doing?
Well in that case, I'll,
um, I'll have a Perrier.
Excellent.
By the way, I really like that stuff you
did on the Donnelly book, you know.
I read the original. I thought
you did some very sophisticated
and intelligent work in it.
Well, thank you, but he
did all the work on that.
Max Perkins said,
"An editor can only release energy,
he cannot be creative himself."
Is that what he said?
Here's to.
And when are you gonna start
releasing my energy?
Why don't we both do our
reading and meet tomorrow?
I'd like that.
May I buy a postcard for Louis and Simone?
Sure, pick one out.
Can I have
a Magic Mountain T-shirt?
Oh, Daddy, let's go to the rollercoaster!
Wait a minute.
Yes, the rollercoaster, please!
No, no, wait… Please! Please!
Rollercoaster! Rollercoaster!
That rollercoaster?
Yeah!
No way, you're talking to the wrong man.
What do you think?
Not me. All right. Is
this the one you want?
Yes.
Okay, how much is that?
25 cents.
You got a deal.
Hey, guys, come with me. I
got a better idea. Okay.
Here we go!
Woah!
Oh!
Let's start with a cap. Everybody in
America has a baseball cap, and so do you.
Uh, what is "La"? No, it's
not "La," that's L.A.
That stands for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the best team in baseball.
Here you go. And this is a baseball.
Hang onto that.
And this is a bat. Two bats.
There's one for you, it's a
Louisville Slugger. Best bat made.
Now, the object of the game is the pitcher
stands on the mound and he throws the ball
to the batter,
and the batter hits the ball.
Now, if the ball goes in
the outfield, the batter
run, run, runs to first base!
What is a base?
The base. The bag.
Uh, all right.
Tell you what.
You like the hat? That's all you need
to know about baseball. Come on.
Daddy, you're not
supposed to look!
I'm not looking. Am I looking?
Did anyone see me look?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hello! What are you guys up to?
Mommy!
Hello, Mrs. Beckwith!
Hi. Hi. Hello, Jean-Claude.
How did it go, huh? Real good,
we missed you. Welcome home.
Wash up, everybody! Oh, Mom, we were
just gonna show you and Dad something!
They were rehearsing a dance recital,
they were trying to teach Jean-Claude
the stank and the pogo. Oh, yes?
Well, what were they just doing?
Was that the stank or the pogo?
You're asking me?
Don't look, Mommy! I never
got beyond the bossa nova.
I won't look. I won't look.
Starving! Kids are getting along
great together, aren't they?
Looks that way, yeah.
Did you happen to see Margo
when you were down there?
Oh, yeah, she's great.
Doing well.
What kind of a guy
is Gavin Wilson?
Um… Charming.
You were always a sucker
for a British accent.
Oh, this stuff must have one
moment when it tastes right.
Well, yeah,
when you're desperate.
When are you going down to
work with him again? Tomorrow.
That soon? I have to take
advantage of his being here.
He's called away often to, um,
testify in lecture places, you know.
How would it be if I came down
to Newport to see you tomorrow?
With the children? No, alone.
I can get a sitter.
Pick you up after you finish work and
take you out to a gourmet dinner.
Maybe catch a show down at
the Old Globe in San Diego.
You're catching me at a time
when I'm very vulnerable
to the idea of
a good dinner, you know.
Robert.
Hmm?
About Newport tomorrow.
Yes?
No.
Just when I thought everything was
coming together for all of us,
she left this morning
without a word.
Well, Bob, you went to France, you had an
affair that resulted in a child and then
you bring the child home…
What do you expect?
I don't know, it was her
idea to bring him here.
No, I don't think so.
I think she was just testing you,
I think she wanted you to say no.
No, no, that's not true, Bernie.
She knew I'd go
to France to see him.
That's why she made the deal.
Ah, come on, if people honored their
deals, I'd be out of business, huh?
I wanna tell you something. You
know the best thing you can do is?
You can send that kid home
as soon as possible.
Today wouldn't be bad.
Oh, come on, Bernie.
Do you know what
that would do to that boy?
Hey, my friend, do you know what
this is gonna do to your marriage?
I mean, you're real close
to being a free agent, Bob.
Another thing. What if Sheila wanted to
get even. Have you thought about that?
No, I haven't.
Would you blame her?
I don't know.
You know something?
These things get real vicious.
And I can only
represent one of you.
That's real comforting, Bernie.
Hey, Frenchie. How come you're
always playing with the girls?
My name is Jean-Claude.
His name is Jean-Claude.
Well, excuse us!
I thought it was Jeanie. Yeah,
with the light brown hair.
He speaks French, and you don't.
You, you… You dope!
Come on, Jean-Claude.
Hey, Jessica. Why don't you take
Jeanie and get him a dress?
Hey, all right!
Come on.
Yay, all right!
Look at this.
He can really play!
Come on, Jean-Claude!
All right. Come on,
block that ball!
Wait a minute.
Is that Jean-Claude?
That can't be Davey.
He's baiting him. I didn't know he
could play soccer. Yeah, I see.
Look at that! Did you see that?
Over the head.
My God. Yeah. It wasn't
quite over his head.
Davey, you're not trying. It's
just not fair. Did you see that?
He's still at it. Bob, you'd better get
rid of that kid before it's too late,
you know that? What do
you mean "too late"?
Before you fall
in love with him.
I already have, Bernie.
Wasn't he incredible? Huh?
Magnifique. But of course.
Daddy, I want to get one.
I think I'll have one myself.
What will it be, gang?
May I have those chips? Yeah, sure, which
one do you want, this one? This one?
Doritos, here you go.
What do you say, gang?
Yep. What will you have, Jean-Claude?
I'll have a Coke.
One Coke. You want any chips?
No, thanks.
No, nothing else?
Okay, I'll be right with you.
Let's see, we got four drinks
and two chips.
Three bucks.
$3, there you go, sir.
You see that kid play soccer? What
a miracle, you really missed something.
How we doing, gang?
Oh, boy, how about
that kid, huh?
Jean-Claude, don't you feel good about
what you just did? I feel good.
Then why don't you smile?
I can feel good without smiling.
You can, huh?
I bet I can make you smile.
I don't believe you can.
I'll go you one better, pal.
I'll bet you
I can make you laugh.
I'll bet you a dollar I can make
you laugh before they count to 10.
10 francs.
10 francs? That's worth about a
dollar and a half, isn't it?
All right, Frenchie, you're
on, but you're gonna laugh.
Right, you guys count.
Okay. One!
No, no, no, not yet.
Wait a minute!
- I got it. Okay, now start counting.
- One!
Jean-Claude, this is my impersonation of
an Olympic swimming champion. Here we go.
Two!
Hello! And it's grandpa
in the lead, huh?
Oh, don't like
horse racing, huh?
Five! Oh, okay, fine. One of the
great jugglers of our time.
Here we go.
Six!
Ah, Dad! Oh, no. I'm gonna lose.
I'm desperate!
Seven! Oh, is he laughing?
Is he laughing?
Put it over his head, Daddy.
Nine!
He's laughing! I did it! I did it!
All right go, Daddy!
All right, Daddy!
Come on, gang.
Let's clean up this mess.
Yeah, I know, it's okay.
We bought everything, right?
There you go. Get all this cleaned up.
There we go.
Hey, you know what? I got a great
idea, listen to this, gang.
What do you say we head home now, and all
of us chip in and make a nice, special,
gourmet dinner for Mom as a big surprise?
All right!
Is it a deal? You hold this.
Can I help?
Only if you smile.
All right.
Good. All right, gang,
finish cleaning up here.
I peeled all the onions.
Good.
When are we gonna
start cooking this?
As soon as I finish
with the ingredients.
What's this called anyhow?
Grandma's chicken.
You're very easy to work with,
Gavi, not at all what I expected.
I'm not sure whether that's a compliment
or not. Formidable, really you are.
Well, I tell you this, this is definitely
going to be the hardest part of every day,
saying goodnight. To you.
Can I tempt you to dinner?
I… I don't think so.
Look…
You're a very attractive woman.
Am I?
You are.
You know, I actually needed
that today, Gavin, thank you.
Here you are, then. Sometimes to
break out is good therapy, no?
Are you making a pass at me?
I'm not sure.
Look, I really am…
I'm just not good
at this, you know.
I do not approach women well. I mean,
I don't. Seems I'm too direct.
Maybe that's why I
write non-fiction.
Look, I may be wrong, but it doesn't
seem as if you want to rush home.
One drink, then.
One brandy.
Just one brandy.
Brandy.
Hi.
Hello!
Wow, I didn't realize editing
was a 12 hour a day job.
No, it isn't. I finished
a couple of hours ago.
Really? Where have you been?
Hmm, wandering around.
Put these down. Oh, I love
that picture of you and Frank.
It's Ted.
Is it?
Oh, was he number two or three?
Oh, will you stop? Come on.
And what were you doing?
Thinking, mostly.
Uh-huh. And when you
weren't thinking?
Well, I had a bacon and tomato sandwich
and a chance to sleep with Gavin Wilson.
I thought so. I hope they
were both delicious.
I finished the sandwich.
Yeah? What about Gavin?
I only went as far as
a brandy at his house.
Well, why didn't you stay for a second one?
Oh, come on, I couldn't.
Weren't you, uh, flattered that a
man like Gavin Wilson wanted you?
I certainly was.
Well, then, what are
you doing here?
Bob went to bed with
somebody he barely knew.
I found out I couldn't.
Margo, could we have some wine?
What do you want?
Red or white?
Red. I'll make a quick call
and see how the kids are.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Robert, it's Sheila.
Sheila!
Where the hell are you?
I'm down at Margo's.
How are the kids doing?
They're fine, love. They made
a very special meal for you,
and we're all
sitting here waiting.
Is there any chance
you can come home?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I don't think I can.
You know, I'm down here
working very hard.
I've been, uh,
preoccupied with things.
Look, Robert, I know,
but I've been busy.
I'm sorry I didn't call,
you know. I'm not perfect.
Huh. I just did something I never
did before. I hung up on Robert.
Your role as the perfect wife is
hardly rewarding, is it? Perfect?
I certainly wasn't
prepared for all the surprises.
It's a long way from
Vassar, isn't it?
Hmm.
I want you guys
to clear the table.
Your favorite.
What is this, one of those new light
wines with very little alcohol?
No!
It's a regular bottle
of cheap Italian.
The kind that used to make us
feel so good in college.
Mmm-hmm. Has our metabolism
changed that much?
Well, I think we just felt pretty
good to begin with in those days.
A gentleman caller?
Hmm, I hope so.
It's Bob, what do you
want me to do?
Ah, let him in.
Hi, Bob. Margo. Sorry
to barge in so late.
Oh, it's no problem. What
are you doing here, Robert?
Who's with the children?
Don't worry about the kids.
Since when do you hang up on me?
Don't start this
in front of Margo.
It's already started.
I asked you a question!
Since when do you
hang up on me, Sheila?
Why don't I make us
all some coffee?
Good idea, Margo.
Why did you hang up on me?
I didn't have anything else
to say to you.
I got some things to say to you.
What do you have to say?
What the hell are you really
doing down here? I'm working!
What's the urgency?
I told you, Gavin is a…
Ah, to hell with him. He's not
Henry Kissinger, for Christ sake,
and you're not working
for Simon and Schuster!
He is a serious writer.
I'm a serious editor.
What are you serious
about, Robert?
I'm serious about
our marriage, God damn it!
That's why I came down here.
The hell you are. You know what
you're serious about? Your son.
All right, what if I am?
What is so wrong about that?
Your son.
To hell with our marriage!
The only thing you've been concerned
about since that boy came to the house
is that somebody would
find out he was my son.
Yeah, well that is right. That is right.
I admit it. I can't deal with it.
Obviously, you can't deal… So
what does that make me? I'm sorry.
I… I'm angry.
I have every right
to be angry. You lied to me.
You never did that to me before.
I'm jealous.
I'm jealous when I see you
look at him the way you do,
with pride in your eyes. You don't
look at the girls that way.
You don't look at me that way.
You don't care.
Oh, Jesus!
Where have you been?
You have never
said to me just once,
"Sheila, can you
handle this?"
You just never reached out
to me emotionally at all.
All right. But it was your idea to
bring him here in the first place.
All right. That was intellectual.
I did it in my head.
But my heart is here. And I
can't make the connection.
All right. It's true!
I had an image of you and an image of our
marriage. And both are shot to hell.
So where do we go from here?
In a funny way, maybe it's the best
thing that could have happened to us.
You know. I mean, everybody has always
treated us as a perfect, perfect couple.
And we find out, don't we?
We're just like
everybody else, aren't we?
We can start from scratch,
if there is any love left.
Well, I'm not everybody else's husband
and you're not everybody else's wife.
And whatever is wrong between us shouldn't
affect the child. He's an innocent bystander.
He is my son, and he's going
be my son all my life.
And I am going to be his father.
You want him to stay here
forever, don't you?
Confess it, Robert.
You know that's what you've been
driving at since he's been here.
It's true. I can't deny it.
That's what I want.
Yeah, I don't know if I can handle it.
You know. I can't.
Love, there are problems
between us, but look,
he is only going to be here for,
what, almost a week. Can't you…
Give a little bit.
Can't you…
I mean…
Listen, I need you, Robert. I need you.
I still love you, and…
I'm lost without you.
Oh, God, I love you, darling.
Can I talk to you for
a minute, Jessie? Hi.
So talk. Not here, outside.
In private.
Come on, Jessie, it's important.
Such an adolescent.
I heard my parents talking
last night…
This is the finest
medical school in California.
What would you think about going
to school here in America?
I'd have to think about it.
My mother wanted me
to go to school in France.
I'm sure she wouldn't have minded if she
knew you were going to be with friends.
Does that mean I would go to school
with Jessica and Paula? Sure.
I would like that.
You'll just have to
give that some thought.
You know, I thought Mr. Wilson
was going to be conceited,
but he wasn't.
Here, let me that for you.
We missed you. Good. I missed you.
Where is everybody anyway?
Mom. Mom! Yes, sweetheart,
we're in here.
What? What's the matter?
Is it true?
Is what true?
Is it true about Daddy
and Jean-Claude?
Did something happen?
What are you talking about?
Who told you?
It is.
I can see it in your face.
What's going on? David just
told me that Jean-Claude
is Daddy's son.
Let me explain it to you.
No! First admit it.
Tell her that Dad
is really his father.
Yes, it's true.
He's our Dad! He's ours.
Don't you understand,
you little idiot?
He had an affair with
Jean-Claude's mother.
What's an affair?
He went to bed with her
and made a baby.
Is Daddy going to leave us?
No, he's not going to leave us.
Look, will you let me
explain it, please?
You ruined our whole family.
It's going to be all right.
Let me explain.
Hey. Hello, everybody.
Guess what?
I took Jean-Claude on
a tour of the university,
and he's decided to enter medical
school tomorrow. Isn't that right?
What…
You. You little bastard!
Jessica!
He's our Daddy,
not yours. He's ours!
Paula.
What the hell is going on here?
Ask your friend Bernie. Why didn't
you put an ad in The Times?
Girls.
Jean-Claude, wait a minute.
Jean-Claude!
Jean-Claude!
Hey, Jean-Claude, wait up.
Hey!
Hey, you forgot something.
I forgot nothing.
Jean-Claude, listen to me. I'm
sorry about what Jessica did you.
Listen to me, will you?
Look, she's upset
with me, not you.
Jessica would never do anything to
harm you. You know that, don't you?
I want to go home tomorrow.
I don't want you to go home.
I should never have come here.
My mother wanted me to go to school at
La Roche, and that is where I'm going.
Is that what you really
want to do?
I belong in France, not here. You
belong here with me. I'm your father.
I… I don't believe you.
Well, it's true, God damn it.
It's true.
Louis knows all about it.
I didn't even know you existed
until a few days ago.
Your mother never
wanted me to know.
I'm sorry. I…
I should have told you
when you first got here.
But I was afraid.
I was trying to protect Sheila
and the girls and myself.
I'm really sorry, Jean-Claude.
I hope you can forgive me for causing
you so much misery and unhappiness.
But I'm happy, Bob.
What?
I'm happy you're my father.
Really?
My mother used to
talk about my father.
What did she tell you?
She said
that he was good,
and kind and funny.
And even when I first saw you,
I hoped that maybe
my father could be
someone like you.
Come on. Take me home,
will you?
My home is in France.
And that's where I feel
I must live now.
I understand.
Jean-Claude.
You okay?
I'm fine, Bob.
You want some dinner?
No, thank you.
I'm going to go upstairs now
and pack.
Okay.
A demain, Jean-Claude.
A demain, Bob.
Did you tell him?
I didn't have any choice.
How is he?
He went upstairs to pack.
He wants to go home tomorrow.
Where are the girls?
In their room.
Bob.
All right, let's have this out.
I want to discuss
things with you.
There's nothing to discuss.
Look, I know how you feel.
No, you don't.
Look, this has been a real big shock for
both of you. And I want to apologize.
I don't want your apology.
Me neither.
I'm apologizing for lying
about Jean-Claude.
And what about your
affair with his mother?
I don't have to apologize
about that to you, young lady.
That's between
your mother and me.
Don't you love us anymore?
Of course I love you, darling.
I love you very much.
Why did you bring him here?
Because I had to see him.
Why?
Because he's my son, Paula.
Look, I did something
about 10 years ago.
Something I shouldn't have done.
I am not very proud of it.
But I am very proud of him.
And up until a few minutes ago, before
you guys found out he was my son,
you thought he was hot stuff,
didn't you?
Come on, admit it. You did.
In your own words, Jessica,
you said he was magnifique.
And he is magnifique.
As long as we're being honest about it,
let's be honest about something else.
You guys have had it
pretty good growing up.
You've have both parents, your
own home and a lot of love.
And all he's had is a mother.
Now she's gone.
Put yourself in my shoes.
What would you do?
What would you do if you heard about
somebody out there all by themselves,
somebody who wasn't
even related to you?
Wouldn't you go out to them?
Sure you would.
I know you would.
Jean-Claude's
going home tomorrow.
I don't know if we'll
ever see him again.
And whether or not you guys decide
to talk to him is up to you,
but I think you owe him
an apology.
Both of you.
You think about it.
I love you both very, very much.
And I know that you love me.
I hope that's the way
you like it.
Thank you.
I'm sorry this has been
such a hard time for you.
No. It is I who should
apologize.
I think I have brought you
much sadness.
It was not my wish.
It's not your fault.
You must never think that.
When I came here,
I did not know.
I know.
We should have told you.
That Bob is my father?
Yes, Jean-Claude.
Bob is your father.
That is why you are
angry with him?
Yes.
So you must also have been
angry with me.
I suppose so, at first.
But then you came.
We got to know each other.
And I hope now
we can be friends.
Can we be friends, Jean-Claude?
Thank you very much
for the coffee, madame.
It was very good.
We have to go now, Jean-Claude.
Please say goodbye
to Jessica and Paula for me.
Goodbye, madame.
Many thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Jean-Claude.
What's going to happen now, Mommy?
I don't know, sweetie.
How can you even talk to Daddy
after what he's done? Jessica.
Do you know the most painful
part of growing up? No.
Discovering nobody is perfect.
Not even your parents.
I called Louis last night. He's going
to pick you up at the airport in Paris.
All right.
Bob, I bet you 10 francs that I can
make you laugh before you count to 10.
I bet you a dollar you can't.
No, no!
It's okay.
Can I see your ticket please?
This is an excursion fare. You
have to stay at least 10 days.
I know. I'm going to pay
the difference.
That's $225.
TWA announces the departure
of Flight 890, non-stop service to Paris,
now boarding at Gate 35. Passengers
please have your boarding passes ready.
You sure you've got enough in
here to read for the flight?
Yes.
Will those passengers
holding green boarding passes,
rows 49 through 65,
kindly board now?
Well, your seat number
is 24, but…
You can board last. We…
We have a few minutes.
Let's sit down over here.
Will those passengers
holding green boarding passes,
rows 48 through 30,
please board now?
So…
Maybe you'll visit us
again at Christmas time.
Or even this summer.
I mean, any time you want.
Thank you.
So, you'll come again
this summer?
Oh, thank God.
We thought we'd missed you.
Jessica and Paula wanted to
say goodbye, Jean-Claude.
I'm really sorry
about what I did.
So am I.
We want you to come
back and see us, Jean-Claude.
Yes, I would like that.
Bye, Jean-Claude.
Goodbye. Excuse me,
are you going on this flight?
Um, no. He is. Well, I will
take his ticket, then.
And you have to board
right away, okay?
Goodbye, Mrs. Beckwith.
Goodbye, Jean-Claude.
I'm sorry, sir. He has
to board right now.
Sir, he has to board the flight
now, or he will not make it.
Go on.
Au revoir, Papa.
Au revoir, mon fils.
Je t'aime.
I love you, too.
