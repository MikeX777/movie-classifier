The danger has passed.

- Yes!
You saw one on the boat?
More or less.
So?

Germans are more romantic
than Italians.
They do not make
dates so easily.
Si? down.

- Lello!
Sorry, I was joking.

Yes, it's a unique opportunity.
If you win the hundred thousand pounds,

Look, honey, I don't do if
for the money ..
...But just for the satisfaction
of competition.
Hundred thousand francs says you suck?
We can pay Gennaro, if we
fish with dynamite.
- But it's dangerous.
- No, it's simple.
Throw the bomb in the
shallow wafer ..
...and get pounds, or tons.

I don't, you idiot! The cigarette
will light the fuse.
Didn't you see

Wouldn't if be bad to scare her?
Cucu.
Oh dear, you've come

No.
- Will you drink a beer?
- Ah yes, yes, thank you.
I'm happy your right leg

All morning I chased if.
You show up with this stick

How's the cold?
Terrible, I have a fever.
- Indigestion?
- No.
It's from the rain on the
fer-race last night.
Here the athletes are soft.
A few little drops of rain

Do you understand? 60!
Idiot .

- One can also die ..
...And you make fun of if.
By the way, ..
...How long will you be mad?
What do I know.
What is your brother doing?
It's my idea.
I put him to work.

on Italian beaches ..
Items are lost every day ..

...Definitely a yes. In fact,
The answer is very short.
I want you to translate if.
("Sorry but I cannot
accept your date.
Either now or aver“).
Fine! She was not that great.
Well! Now don't pretend you
don't care.
Do you expect a woman to give
in immediately?
Keep frying.
I already fried, foo much,
and I'm fired of if.
She clearly said no.
Am I wrong?
Let me finish, often women
say no, when they really want to.
If I were you,
I'd fry Evelin again.
Then I write
another letter?
No, no more letters.
This time you have to try ..
...To talk to her in person.
- About what?
(SPEAKS IN GERMAN)
- Eh?
That's a verse of a ballad
popular in Berlin.
"On this day I'm in
love with you".
If' s beautiful!
Do one thing, write if on here.
Write how to pronounce if.
Who are you?
Quick, help ma.
- What do you want?

My life is in your hands.
But you are a prisoner.
I am a fugitive,
I escaped from hell.

We always fry to escape.
They beef me for years and
years.
- You cannot understand.
- Calm down.
Calm down. Nobody will follow you now.
I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid.
Hide me.
Hide me, fake me anywhere,
but do not fake me back there
Stay calm, stay cool.
This will help you.
- What is if?
- Whisky.
Good! I never drink.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go ashore.
No, stop! I know you want
to furn me over to the police.
- I'll pay you.
- Come on, I'm rich.
I do not need money.
Yes, but two million
would make you comfortable.
Oh, just stop if! Otherwise
I'll send you back.
Forgive ma!
I don't know who to trust.
They have always been
so bad to ma.
I have to hide you
in a safe place.

No, no. You are right.
Are there many people at' your home?
I don't know, brothers

Looking of the girl?
Idiot!
I'm an athlete, remember.
You don't scare ma.
I'll break your nose.
Yes, yes, eat your toast.
I'll eat when I like.
No, no.
You're just materialistic.
Don't you realize the beauty
of the nature that surrounds you.
- What do I care about nature.
- Oh, no!
Here is a dream scenario,
a wonderful view ..
.. On this enchanted bay.
All those hairy men
with glasses, like you, ..
...They are insensitive.
You don't think of anything but
gorging on pasta.
That's not true! I also like
nature.
Sea? You see Naples,
Vesuvius.
You know that Vesuvius
is belching? -
Don' 1' smoke more!
It's all full.
I checked everywhere.
I asked if they could
accommodate you.
Ah, behold, there is one free.
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.
Oh no!
Not this time!
Relax, it's not
important. I have another pair.
I'm sorry, I'm always
the same.
So, it's not only swimming
that interests you, ..
...But other sports foo.
- What would you suggest?
Wrestling, for example.
It's a sport of sorts.
Ah, for the twist?
It's all been a misunderstanding.
Then why did you trip that
guy?
Mg?
If was he who stumbled on
my foot and fell.
Really.
What's this?
What we think when someone acts
like that.
At your service.
I recommend our
excellent fish soup.
Fish? No, for heaven's sake,
I would like a casserole in the oven.
- Sames as him?
- Me foo.
Well.
One, two, three, four ..
...Five, six hundred, ..
...Six hundred and thirty.
And fifteen 'rip .
Five is enough.

- Who is if?
Your dream girl.
Hello.
I'm sick of my stomach.
But did you see? Necklaces,
bracelets, pendants, ..
...Rings.
If looks like a Tiffany window.
We need money .
Well, she's living in a fem'?
What do you know?
The Americans are eccentric.
"I. have on idea.
She's in love with you,
you're there, and she gives you ..
...A necklace.
- What about father?
Freed from the family yoke.
I'll give you an example ..
...From the films of Pasolini.
Take off your glasses
and you won't be able to see.
But she's an old woman,
built like jelly!
I'm very sorry but only a
portion of lasagna was left.
I could just cuss.
- Who should I give if to?
- Miss.
Thanks.
Enjoy your meal.
What are you doing this afternoon?
Oh, I found a hidden place

Sorry, but I go there alone.
Why don't you surrender?
You would reduce the penalty.
No, I never will.
It's not your business.
How do you know that song?
Eh?

And this is a song of
art, ..
..."A Grain of Sand."
No, than if was copied.

and years to see a beautiful woman ..
...Like you.
You know, I've waited seventeen
years.
But you rob banks ..

But I had no money, you understand?
You only understand about
wealth.
With this villa.
What do you know about poverty?
But I like you anyway.
What are you doing? Perhaps
we should go.
I prepared a delicious lunch.
No, I'm not hungry.
But how? For years you only

Exactly, my stomach Shrunk.
Yes, I got skinny.

Just when you think you're fired ..

Sleep? Don't even think about if.
But how? You spent three days

Now that she is almost falling ..
...At my feet,

Now I don't like her as much.
But you said that she was
hot and impetuous.
Yes, but I don't like that,
and then the German ..
...It's foo different, we
can't talk to each other.
The language is an obstacle.
Instead, a girl like you

Maybe we should hold hands.
- Hold my hand ..

- We can't kiss?
- No.
Didn't you understand?
I said that I love you.
And I'm felling you no.
And I don't care at all.
What are you doing? I fold you no.
Remember what you taught me?

When a woman says no

Here, every kiss
reminds me ..
that our debt
No, really, it's yours.
I ruined the vacation.
Loving all the women.
At' least you got some in your

The daughter of a great chief.
Ah, you're back.
Where's the seventy thousand?
This is if, and give us the change.
This is glass, cheap glass.
So?
We ask you to let us

Waif a minute.
Dear Mr. Gennaro,

...of the seventy thousand
Italian lire 
Absolutely not.
Wretch!
Thanks, Mother,
I'm such a man.
Oh , poor dear .
- Ah!
- Shut up, I feel like..
I'm lost.
- Hold on, please.
- I like you, I love you.
For years
1 have not seen a woman.
I do not even remember
what they are like.
Frankly, all I know
about women ..
...I learned from stories of
friends, the doodles I did ..
...On the walls of the cell.
Enough with the theory,
Teach me how to kiss.
Nanni, listen.
You must return to prison.
- No, never.
- You have 10.
No, if I go back to prison,
I'll be there when I'm old.
I'd better take advantage
of this opportunity.
- I ..
- I should stay out.
Nanni, listen, when you get out
of prison ..
...You will be thirty-seven.
- Eh.
You will have a new life,
and than I...
than I might love you.
Y u“?
- You love ma?
- Yes, but on one condition.
Now you pick up the phone,
call the Commissioner ..
. . And return.
So you will not
increase your punishment.
- Call.
- No, I can not.
But why?
Why do you want me to go back
to those people?
You do not know what life is
like in a cell ..
...And forced labor,
a cell and forced labor.
It's better to enjoy these days
of freedom on the run ..
...Like a beast,
before I go back, ..
...The penalty will increase,
but I really don't care.
You know why? Here alone,
I'll have something to remember.
The unforgettable hours
spent with you.
Yes, yes, dear.
Operator?
I want the Commissioner.
Hello, Commissioner?
Commissioner.
My name is Nanni Colizzi.
I escaped from Procida
and I want to surrender.
- I am a. .. (TELEPHONE) You

It's been fen years since
anyone escaped from Procida.
The heat must have gone
to his head.
- Molino, Nicola!
- Ah, that's ma.
Good morning.
Come in.
Excuse me, I was stripped,
but they brought me ..
...my clothes
and I have not had time ..
Si? down.
This is an injustice, you know?
Why am I treated like a thug?
Do you know that the quarter-
finals are ruined?
- What has been ruined?
- The quarter-finals, the race.
- I protest.
- You can protest ..
...Because you are known here,
are you not?
I don't know, but I am innocent.
- Innocent.
- Of course, what have I done wrong?
- Where were you earlier?
- Well, of lunch.
- And than?
- And than
Then, before the race,
I was on the beach. ..
On the beach, lucky you, that
you could go to the beach.
So, on the beach eh?
Then we read ..
. . Sassu's report.
("On the Beach,
happened to be ..
...At' Punta del Faro
I watched a person ..
...of young age ..
...Turned out to be Nicola
Molino ,..")
(".. Thai', in womens’' clothes,
walked to the beach.
After that the person ..
...removed the
womens’' clothing ..
.. Keeping on two pieces")
But Commissioner,
let me explain.
I understand now, OK?
Do not interrupt ma.
("After a few minutes she
took off one of the two pieces, ..
...the fop ..
...And soon after, ..
...Since if was a remote area ..
...also the bottom part")
Eh!
Yuck!
"Yuck," if does not say that
here.
("Signed, Agent
Sassu Daniele")
- Ah, you laugh?
- Have you read that correctly?
You don't think so!
Of course I read that correctly.
If says, Nicola Molino.
No, Nicole Molino
She's a woman.
Ni-co-le, a French female.
Well Perhaps, then, it's
not written too clear.
We must ask the drafter
of the report.
Call agent Sassu.
Sassu is not here today,
Commissioner.
He's gone to Naples but
will be back tomorrow.
Everyone else goes somewhere,
and I'm always here, here, here.
It's a joke, Michael.
Oh, it's soup.
Good.
You're not going to eat?
I don't want to eat with you!
Ah, well! You're the guilty
one, eh?
What should I say? You've
ruined the quarter-finals, ..
...You've ruined everything,
I've even been sent to jail.
You want to see me on the
guillotine? on the gallows?
I've denounced you.
Spy.
You're right! So learn to
sunbathe in your swimsuit.
What do you want?
Are you jealous, eh?
Of him?
You' re imagining.
Then you're a moralist.
Stop! You can call me
whatever you like ..
...as most French.
But what annoys me most ..
...He got to see more than ma.
Do you know what I would have given
to fake a peek, eh?
What?
A lot!
I mean, I have no reason 'to
think that you would.
What do I know about you?
Only that you care about
under-wafer fishing, ..
...That you don't like women.
Indeed, I have the impression that ..
...You get nervous.
I like women a lot.
Don't you think I'm cute?
You've never fried to kiss
me.
Have you never kissed
o woman?
I behave you have.
I held my breath for 30 seconds.
- Is that a record?
- Well, almost.
Well?
You, guys.
Oh!
Hey'
- Eh?
- Please.
That's not a good idea ..
...This is not the place
to make out.
- Excuse us, Commissioner.
- You're excused.
I spoke with agent Sassu, and
the misunderstanding was cleared up.
- So, can we go?
- It's all over?
You have to pay
a fine.
Oh , okay .
- You can go. - Goodbye,
Commissioner.
- Goodbye.
- Good day.
- If we hurry, we may have
time. - For what?
- To sunbathe before
sunset. - Okay, let's go.
A sunbath at sunset.
Bu?!
Commissioner.
An urgent call.
I knew if.
Where am Y?
In the middle of the ocean?
She tricked ma.
I'm stranded in the ocean.
Help.
Oh, damn if!
Which way should I go?
Oh, Mother, who? have I done
to deserve this?
621' out!
What I want, ma'am,
when I come here ..
...A guy like ma,
modestly, to have all of them ..
.. In my arms.
Did you have many adventures?
I'd rather not talk about if.
I understand, you're a gentleman.
Hove you booked a hotel
in Capri?
- The Quisisana.
- Me foo.
We must ensure that these
inconveniences stop.
Don' 1' you think?
Oh sure. What could be done?
- I don't know.
- Let's get married.
Just think, I would not even
have to change my surname.
Eh!
And you wouldn't have to
sleep on the fer-race.
I'm going to sneak a kiss.
Look, someone dropped o hot
"m the sea.
- Make a wish.
- Quick.
Tell ma?
Goodbye!
- Lucky them!
- Eh!
We'll see you next year!
Work! Work!
Spartacus!
