Our men are in there. We need backup.
ls this a crematorium or something?

50
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,118
Chief, l barely made it out of there.

51
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,283
Let's go, Ax.

52
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,763
Chief, chief... Dammit.

53
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,229

Okay...lt's okay.

72
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,058
It looks about 4 or 5 meters.

73
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,765
Want me to measure it?

74
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,158
It's a bit dangerous.
Better be careful.

75
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,227
You're the one in danger.

76
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,882
Go up!

77
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,267

You want everyone to die?
We're all gonna die, moron!

- Got him.

106
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,800
Sang-woo! Sang-woo!

107
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,719
Sang-woo! Sang-woo!

108
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,570

117
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,049
Someone, there's someone inside!
There's someone there!

118
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,380
There's someone in there!

119
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,686
Let's withdraw for now.

120
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,283
I'm telling you, there's someone there!

121
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,915
Dammit! Why aren't they

God dammit, respond!

125
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
They're out!

126
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,647
Oh, mom. Mom.

127
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,263
You live in Apt. 405, right?

128
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,734
Bro...

129
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,980
Chul-goo...he's gonna be fine.

130
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,290
Let's go.

131
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,725
Hey, Chul-goo. Bro, you're not
gonna die. Hang in there, okay?

132
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,537
Do something, will ya?

133
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,371
Come on! Move it, already!

134
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,279
Hey, get out of the way!

135
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,545
Hold on a little longer, Chul-goo!

136
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,643
- Another fire?
- Yes. He's already the fifteenth.

137
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,223
Respiratory distress.
We washed him with saline
and injected 50cc of medicine.

138
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,817
Are you crazy? If you don't know then
don't do it! You trying to kill him?

139
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,054
But the situation...

140
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,826
There are no more beds.
We're shorthanded so we
paged the off-duty residents.

141
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,870
Transport this patient to
Dong- A Hospital first.

142
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,631
Transport this patient to Dong-A
Hospital first. And the other patients.

143
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,969
What, you bastard? You moving
a dying man to another hospital?

144
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,337
Okay now?

145
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,246
Are you crazy? Get this person out.

146
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:19,257
Hey. If he dies, so do you.

147
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,703
Can l help?

148
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,240
- We need to move this patient
to a room first. - Okay.

149
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,209
Excuse me. Here. Yes.

150
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,317
Oh. It just went bang! Bang!

151
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,918
You said that before.
Tell me about the family in Apt. 405.

152
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,963
I'm telling you, it went bang! Bang!

153
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,965
I'm Seol In-jae,
the detective in charge.

154
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,968
Sir, a moment over there, please.

155
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,069
Hyun!

156
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,008
How far along are you?

157
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,380
- I'm still investigating.
- Hand it over.

158
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,814
- What have you done?
- I'll be done soon.

159
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,980
- It just went bang!
- One second.

160
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:35,499
Just hand in your report later.
I'll take a look. You're not
gonna put arson again, are you?

161
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,529
- This way.
- It was a bang! Bang!

162
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,766
Okay, tell me slowly,
from the beginning.

163
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,741
- So it was like...
- Yes, go on.

164
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,815
If it was up to me,
Chul-goo would have been first.

165
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:07,727
We lost In-soo. Chul-goo could
have gone that way, too.

166
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,162
He could've been burnt
to the crisp like paper.

167
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,838
Let's finish this quickly and go.

168
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:28,185
After becoming your partner, on
every job, l look for the exit first.

169
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,952
There's no one to help me anyway.
Because I'm alone.

170
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,831
l want to live.

171
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:51,999
Apt. 405. There was no one.

172
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,361
I'll request a change of partner.

173
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,101
Will that do?

174
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,891
ln-soo...

175
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,786
In-soo. Where are you?

176
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:18,887
In-soo. Answer me.
In-soo. Answer me, In-soo.

177
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:27,062
Sang-woo. Come out quick.
Let's have a cigarette.

178
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,976
In-soo, Sang-woo. It's out of control!
Hurry up! In-soo!

179
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,983
In-soo!

180
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:07,369
ln-soo... ln-soo...

181
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,109
How are you these days?

182
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:19,681
Oh, I'm good.
Work environment's good. Most of all,
I'm so happy to be around kids.

183
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,024
- So-eun, Jung-uk, Jang-sun...
- 'Family killed, convicted arsonist'

184
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,060
Oh, l hear Jangsun's going home soon.

185
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:33,495
- He's healthy now. You were big help.
- 'Age 15: killed 6 in fire'

186
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:41,239
When l first met you,
l was about Jang-sun's age.
l wanted to do the same.

187
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,645
'Regained speech ability' Like you,
l want to comfort the children.

188
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,947
The children seem to look forward
to reading time now.

189
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,648
- Really? - 'Presently
paroled-supervision: Dr. Jung'

190
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:58,156
l feel like I'm reborn.

191
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,097
It's all thanks to you.

192
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,161
Still, stop cleaning my room now.

193
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,798
l like doing it.

194
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:18,708
You know Sung-euns back?
Because of yesterdays fire.

195
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:22,617
Yes. She drew pictures
with me yesterday.

196
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,821
I'm a little worried about her, too.

197
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,255
Can you find my patient records,
from 15 years ago?

198
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,164
- Yes.
- Please bring it to my room.

199
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,100
- Yes.
- Are you kidding me?

200
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,867
Insurance only covers the basics.
Burns infect easily.

201
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:47,844
With infection, the patient can die.
The patient has to pay for that.

202
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,746
Ha! You're killing me!
You guys are out to drive us crazy!

203
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:59,916
Shit! Listen. A fire!
It's bad enough he got hurt
putting out a fire! Now pay up?

204
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:04,223
Wait, so the police and military
get it for free but we have to pay?

205
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,321
Nonsense!
Man, l could just blow a fuse!

206
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,357
Anyway, I've informed the family.
Please make a decision soon.

207
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,434
What? Excuse me. Wait.

208
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,574
Oh, hey.

209
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,132
When did you get here?

210
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,907
Gasoline?

211
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:04,388
Yeah. The path of the fire
was unnatural.

212
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,790
Even though the window was open, the
fire moved against the flow of air.

213
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,388
It looks like someone kept feeding the
fire, while constantly watching us.

214
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,701
Constantly? From in here?

215
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,094
Um...

216
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,190
I've already told the
police everything.

217
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,735
Sorry to keep bothering you.

218
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,966
It's just that a gas explosion
from your home started the fire.

219
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,742
- Did you use a gas heater, by any
chance? - No, nothing like that.

220
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:44,083
My husband comes home for lunch every
day. He had lunch on that day, too.

221
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:52,255
My mom and husband were home.
And l was at the supermarket.

222
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:59,301
It was about the time my child
came home so l went to
the kindergarten to pick her up.

223
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:07,269
But the school bus had already left.
So l thought my child was at home.

224
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,810
The gas must have leaked.
It was such an old building...

225
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,353
- By any chance...
- Please...

226
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,616
Please, don't come anymore.

227
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:24,223
l need to go to the hospital.
My daughter must be hungry.

228
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,195
l hope your husband gets well soon.

229
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,711
Let's go.

230
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,981
Sang-woo. It's so hard.

231
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,783
New member, Jung Jong-Gu.

232
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,796
On Dec. 15, 2000, appointed to
85th Station, reporting for duty!

233
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,292
It's an honor.

234
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,092
What's an honor?

235
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,796
First in early extinguishment.
First in rescue.

236
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,170
The 85th Station is a legend, isn't it?

237
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,709
Legend, whatever. Damn.

238
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,767
Hey, take your bag off.

239
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,843
Take your bag off quick.

240
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,211
Lower yourself.

241
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,526
- Yo, new recruit!
- Yes?

242
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,263
You think a legend just happens, huh?
Hold tight!

243
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,537
Ah! Help me! Ow. It hurts. Help me.

244
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,871
l went through that, too.

245
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,110
l was only in my underwear.
Be thankful, okay?

246
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,745
- Hey, do it right.
- Pull out a chair.

247
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,087
Help yourself. It's delicious.

248
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,696
Hey, you eat now, too.

249
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,493
Yes. Thank you!

250
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,733
Here's to a good meal!

251
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,442
Wow, this is really good.

252
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,383
He was the Chief's brother.
He and Sang-woo were partners.

253
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:39,514
They were a fantastic team.
Like you said, they were
a legend, a legend.

254
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,857
And it's not a spoken promise
but always leave a place for In-soo.

255
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,261
I'm sorry. l will never
sit there again.

256
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:52,962
That's not what l mean, buddy.
Uh, it's itchy again.

257
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,029
Damn, so much for
getting married. Follow me.

258
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:56,903
Yes.

259
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,200
Hmm, go in.

260
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,175
You go first, sir.

261
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,840
Go in, l said. Hurry up!

262
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,609
Have a good time.

263
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,813
What happened?

264
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:18,851
- Harder, chief.
- Think back when you were young.

265
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,397
- You were really hard on me. You
were, bro. - Don't make me laugh.

266
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,558
- Should we raise it?
- Raise it, come on.

267
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,498
Generate sound effects.

268
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,408
The Young-jun Pharmacy case, at least.

269
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,637
There are some records,
since you investigated, right?

270
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,839
Hey, where's Chief Kang's report?

271
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,715
l asked the chief to hold off.
We're still investigating.

272
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:47,418
What are you doing?
Our duty's to investigate off
of your report. Our duty!

273
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,018
But why are you here
asking for our reports? Huh?

274
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,663
These are pictures of your boyfriend.
Can you handle it?

275
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,737
- What about the depositions?
- There are none. Zero.

276
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,139
Detective Seol.

277
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:09,009
Listen carefully. l understand
how you feel but this fire
was just a gas explosion.

278
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,637
A gas explosion. An accidental fire.

279
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,146
You confuse things up like that time
and l won't take it. Got it?

280
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,578
It's not that there wasn't an arsonist,
but you couldn't catch one, right?

281
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,451
What?

282
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,257
Give me the depositions.

283
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:42,235
This is Chul-goo's equipment.
This is Chul-goo's.

284
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,412
Hyun-tae, l hear your suits trashed?

285
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,115
Yes.

286
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,352
Use this for now.

287
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,685
This is In-soo's.

288
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,368
And this is for you.

289
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:20,248
I've never regretted becoming a fire
fighter. He probably felt the same way.

290
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:30,952
Whoever saved 'Chu Chu' last week,
telephone for you in the lobby.

291
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,665
- Say it loudly, okay?
- Yeah, it's a puppy so we'll take it.

292
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,631
- Chu Chu.
- How can we find your mom?

293
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,834
- Okay. I'll put him on.
- Oh, it's Chu Chu's owner.

294
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,512
ls this Sung-jung?

295
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:55,712
ls Chu Chu fine?
Where's your mom?

296
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,485
You want me to find your mom?
Oh, l have to go. Sorry.

297
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,631
Geumjung 2 Dong Fire Station.
Jo Sang-woo speaking. Yes?

298
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:14,068
- l can't hear you very well.
- Let's go, bro.

299
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,869
Sang-woo, hurry up. Hurry.

300
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,279
Go.

301
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:43,856
- 27-2. This is 85-1. - This is 27-2.
Looking into present situation.

302
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:48,997
Damn, l thought today was quiet.
Why gas? That's the fucking worst.

303
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:54,705
- This is 85-1.
- 85-4 already on scene. Not a big one.

304
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,043
It being a gas station, look carefully
into a possible second explosion.

305
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:02,916
And good news for you. Kim Chul-goo
has regained consciousness.

306
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,319
- Thank you.
- Sure. Be well in the cold.

307
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,961
What was that phone call about?

308
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,736
l don't know. A wrong number, l think.
Something like 'don't interfere'.

309
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,365
- What?
- Sounded like a prank call.

310
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:30,437
- Ha, ha. Chul-goo's back!
- Man, Chul-goo made it. He made it.

311
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,064
Welcome chief. We closed the corner
because of the gas.

312
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,771
Yo, bro. l don't think
we need to unload.

313
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,474
- Sang-woo.
- Yes.

314
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:12,515
It's our district so be fully prepared
for a second explosion.

315
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,249
- Hyun-tae.
- Yes?

316
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,884
- Go and confirm if the valve
is locked first. - Sure.

317
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:22,092
Sang-woo, Ax, examine the gas tank
area and make sure of the origin point.

318
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:27,229
And just in case, go fully equipped.
Let's hurry up and go. It's cold.

319
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,204
Let's finish it quick,
and go to the hospital.

320
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,746
Excuse me. One second.

321
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,910
Do l have to pay again?
Why did you bring two fire trucks?

322
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,681
We don't take money.
Where's the origin of fire?

323
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,012
Over there. There.

324
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,418
- Move back.
- Clear the way, please.

325
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,463
It's dangerous.

326
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,667
- ls this the origin point?
- No. I'm just taking a picture.

327
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:08,969
l should report the owner. There are
illegal gas tanks in the back.

328
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,095
The temperature of the tanks is rising.

329
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,600
Park Han-moo!

330
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,005
What's up?

331
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:44,070
Re- examine the tank area.
Something's not right.

332
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,979
What? What's wrong with the tanks?

333
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,919
- Where does that pipe lead to?
- I've never seen that pipe before.

334
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,287
It's strange.

335
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,666
Get out!

336
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,767
Move!

337
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,506
God dammit.

338
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,046
Let's go!

339
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,016
Run!

340
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,143
Water!

341
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,738
Water!

342
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,681
Water! Water!

343
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,115
Who the hell are you?

344
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,969
Jae-hyuk! Jae-hyuk!

345
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,542
Take pictures. Take everything.
Pictures of everything.

346
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,427
Move.

347
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,045
Bang.

348
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,441
Move!

349
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,328
Go! Hurry up!

350
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,761
- Get me out of here!
- Grab it.

351
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,534
Uh, damn.

352
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,225
Let's go. Go, go!

353
00:51:54,578 --> 00:52:01,780
- Sang-woo! Ax! Jun-sung!
- Snap out of it!

354
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,952
Jun-sung! Jun-sung!

355
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:20,468
Gotta save them, save them!
Sang-woo!

356
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,649
Hey, Chul-goo! Get up now, buddy.

357
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,628
Even the baby in your wife's belly
would laugh at you.

358
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,041
- Jun-sung.
- What?

359
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,877
The gas station owner,
is he dead?

360
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:09,313
Didn't you see the body bag?
Once you're inside, you're nothing.

361
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:14,050
Still, for a fire that size,
not too bad. Not bad.

362
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,729
Detective Park, that's not the way
to do it. What is this?

363
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:30,769
Detective Park.

364
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,608
Okay.

365
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:37,079
Please search this number for me.
It's for Detective Seol.

366
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,547
- Really?
- Yes.

367
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,315
Remember the Phoenix Fire
Insurance case, last month?
I'll give you some info.

368
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,704
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's fine.

369
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:53,652
Young-jun...

370
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:40,864
Are you okay?

371
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,235
Yes, I'm fine.

372
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,742
Oh, it's warm here.

373
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,938
You must have been cold.
Shall l turn up the heat?

374
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:59,480
l left the temperature up before.
They must have rebelled
when l wasn't here.

375
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:05,495
Hee-soo. Why'd you do it, back then?

376
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,599
The children, 15 years ago.

377
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,698
Help! Help!

378
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,134
Why are you asking me?

379
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,474
Why are you so curious nowadays?

380
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:34,982
What more do you want
to know about me?

381
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,497
Are you asking
because you really don't know?

382
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,101
They hit me.

383
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:06,618
It must be a patient.
We'll talk later.

384
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,061
Detective Seol In-jae
