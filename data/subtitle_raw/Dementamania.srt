1
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,917
To
save the 130-year-old bank

2
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,958
from collapse, there is talk of cutting

3
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,958
200 jobs over the next week.

4
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,625
The European Central Bank has
made the decision to downgrade

5
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,417
its growth forecast next
month, as new data has shown

6
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,125
one in four Italians are now unemployed.

7
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,083
More on that another financial
news later in the show.

8
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,417
In local news, a man claiming to be

9
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,625
a Catholic priest arrested
in Gatwick Airport

10
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,833
after he was caught carrying cocaine.

11
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,042
Jesus.

12
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,417
How did you get in here?

13
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,333
Shit.

14
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,667
This week feels like it's lasted a month.

15
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,500
This month feels like a year.

16
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,208
Time tends to drag when every day

17
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,875
is as uneventful as the last.

18
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,167
I can't remember the last time

19
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,458
I was excited about something.

20
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,042
It's like there was this
void that just gets bigger

21
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,208
and bigger no matter what I fill it with.

22
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:08,083
Wake up, go to work, come
home, watch TV, go to bed.

23
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,375
There has to be more to life than this,

24
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,958
this painful, monotonous existence.

25
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,417
You have four new messages.

26
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,958
Hey Ed, it's Carrie.

27
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,917
Call me back when you get this.

28
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,042
Hey Ed, it's--

29
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,917
Hey Ed. 

30
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,042
Good evening
Mr. Arkham, it's Dr. Rathkin.

31
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,708
I was disappointed when you didn't

32
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,333
turn up for our session on Tuesday.

33
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,833
I'm calling because I
honestly felt as though

34
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,875
we were making progress,
up until our last meeting,

35
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,208
which was disconcerting, to say the least.

36
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,833
Please call me when you get this message.

37
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:47,833
Thanks.

38
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:09,917
Hi, Ed.

39
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,000
We must stop meeting like this.

40
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,958
How come you didn't come over last night?

41
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,833
Carrie lives next door.

42
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:19,792
I got back late last night.

43
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,292
I didn't get a messages till this morning.

44
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,167
Okay, well, how about
you come over tonight?

45
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,792
I'll cook some food, and we can
watch a movie, or something.

46
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,583
I'm sorry, I can't do tonight.

47
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,583
Stop making excuses.

48
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,333
We went out a few weeks back.

49
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,292
One thing led to another, and
I ended up back at her place.

50
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,167
You can't treat me like this.

51
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,292
Okay, maybe it happened more than once.

52
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,583
Look, you know I've just
broke up with Laura.

53
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,167
Oh, come on, it's been almost a year.

54
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,917
And that's not what you said last week

55
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
when you were begging me to let you do

56
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,042
exactly what you wanted.

57
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,000
You're having that
shit for breakfast now.

58
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,208
What?

59
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,917
I'll do whatever I want.

60
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,917
Don't you ignore me.

61
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,667
That woman scares me.

62
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,625
There seems no escape.

63
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,625
From what exactly, I'm unsure.

64
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,167
But the only place I'm ever truly at ease

65
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,292
is here in the car.

66
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:56,792
Morning, Mikey.

67
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,667
Morning, Edward.

68
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,583
Edward.

69
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,542
David Snodgrass.

70
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,833
Backs-stabbed his way up the ladder,

71
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,917
and is universally despised.

72
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,958
Snodgrass.

73
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,083
What's it like up there
in development, then?

74
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,125
It's good, thanks.

75
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,250
They should use people like
him for product testing

76
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,625
in laboratories, instead
of innocent animals.

77
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,375
Aren't you working on that?
Dealing software for KBank?

78
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,375
Yeah, that's right.

79
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,708
Heard, you went way over budget, Eddie.

80
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,333
It's not a good place to be these days.

81
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,375
Well, we--

82
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,542
Why don't you tell me on the way up?

83
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:39,333
Right, so Ed, what floor are you again?

84
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,708
Seven, please.

85
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,208
Seven, seven.

86
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,375
Ah, there we go, seven.

87
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,167
And four, right, great.

88
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,375
So, please continue.

89
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,875
Well, we had a few issues
with the accounting modules,

90
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,875
but other than that, the
application's pretty much done,

91
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,958
so it's not too bad.

92
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,583
Hmm. 

93
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,875
I see.

94
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
That's good, good.

95
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,500
Now, these accounting
modules that you speak of,

96
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,875
what stage are we at at the moment, Ed?

97
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,750
Because we were thinking, that is,

98
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,458
me and my team were thinking,

99
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,417
So, that's where we are with
management at the moment, and,

100
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,250
Fourth floor.

101
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,958
That's your stop, isn't it?

102
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,458
Oh yeah, fourth.

103
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,375
I've been meaning to
have a chat with you, Ed.

104
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,583
So maybe I'll come up with this
afternoon and I'll find you.

105
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,375
All right?

106
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,458
Did you get my email last week?

107
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,250
About the party tonight?

108
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,792
Christian's over from the States.

109
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,583
I've got a meeting with
him in, like, five minutes.

110
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,250
We'll chat later, okay?

111
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,625
Am I invited?

112
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,708
Probably not.

113
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,125
Sometimes, you sound
like such a loser, Steven.

114
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,917
Mind your own business, Pablo.

115
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,417
Fuck you.

116
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
No, fuck you.

117
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,333
No, fuck you.

118
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,167
No, fuck you.

119
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,167
Fuck you.

120
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,083
Enough.

121
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,667
What's this party she's talking about?

122
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,500
I hear there's going
to be a lot of bitches.

123
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,292
It's a birthday party at the Forge.

124
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,125
The Forge?

125
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,875
Yeah, the Forge, remember?

126
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,667
We've been there before.

127
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,583
No, but go on.

128
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,583
It's gonna be a pussy fest.

129
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:21,667
We have to go.

130
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,583
Big boy condoms,
penis enlargement, free Viagra.

131
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,542
This place, it's eating me alive.

132
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,292
Cooped up 10 hours a day, meetings,

133
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,250
deadlines, reports,
annoying office politics,

134
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,917
subjected to the same dull
personalities every day.

135
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,833
Morning, Eddie.

136
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,292
And I hate it
when people call me Eddie.

137
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,250
Hello again.

138
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,583
Have we met?

139
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,917
In another life, perhaps.

140
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,625
I don't believe in that stuff.

141
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,750
Maybe you should.

142
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,542
I'm quite happy living
in the real world.

143
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,458
Of course.

144
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,167
Nicholas Lemarchand.

145
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,833
Your hand is freezing.

146
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,000
Edward Arkham.

147
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,375
It's a medical condition.

148
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,792
I've had it for as long as I can remember.

149
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,667
What is it?

150
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,833
Don't worry.

151
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,417
It's not contagious.

152
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,708
So, what do you do here, Ed?

153
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,625
You don't mind me calling you Ed, do you?

154
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,125
I'm a software analyst.

155
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,042
Senior software analyst.

156
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,333
And how long have you been here?

157
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,917
It'll be five years in October.

158
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,750
A long time.

159
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,708
Five years.

160
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:35,917
Yep.

161
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,500
Are you okay?

162
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,250
I didn't sleep too well last night.

163
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,417
Did you see that?

164
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,375
Did I see what?

165
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,375
Sorry, I've just got a thing about.

166
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,083
Bugs?

167
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,083
Yeah.

168
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:20,708
It's funny how such small,
helpless little creatures

169
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,708
can provoke such terror.

170
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,250
They aren't so helpless.

171
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,875
One of those little bastards
stung me this morning.

172
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,875
Hurts, doesn't it?

173
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:45,542
Yeah.

174
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, everything
happens for a reason, Ed.

175
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,583
For the greater good, I guess.

176
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:53,500
Or evil.

177
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,875
I'll see you around.

178
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,792
Sure.

179
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,167
Sorry mate, can you go around?

180
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,917
I've known people like you.

181
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,500
Can't live the life you
really want to live,

182
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,625
because the law forbids it.

183
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:28,958
Boundaries set by so-called
modern society to stop people

184
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:33,125
acting on their impulses,
their natural instinct.

185
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,167
But it doesn't have to be that way.

186
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,250
Conformity is weakness.

187
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,500
Let go, Edward.

188
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,083
They don't care about you.

189
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,208
Nobody does.

190
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,208
You are alone.

191
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:20,083
Equal their depravity in vengeance.

192
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,292
What are you looking at?

193
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,958
Get a grip, Ed.

194
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,333
Get your own calculator.

195
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,250
It is estimated that
50,000 people in the UK

196
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,667
are severely allergic to
stinging insect venom.

197
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,917
Every year, 12 deaths from
stinging reactions are reported.

198
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,667
Hey, Ed.

199
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:47,917
What do you want?

200
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,875
Just wanna talk to you about

201
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,708
testing environments.

202
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,250
What about them?

203
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,458
One of the guys needs to install

204
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,250
some updates on Dev-6, but I,

205
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,625
I thought I'd run it past you first.

206
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,167
You thought you'd run it past me first?

207
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,458
You came all the way up
here just to run it past me.

208
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,417
Did you ever think of using one of these?

209
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,875
You are obviously busy.

210
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll come back later.

211
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,042
No!

212
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,500
You all right?

213
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,458
You all right?

214
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,708
I'm fine, thanks.

215
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,542
I'm fine.

216
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,458
Everything all right?

217
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,500
How's it hanging?

218
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:30,917
Shit.

219
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:38,208
They say talking to oneself
is the first sign of madness.

220
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,250
I'm not talking to myself.

221
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,000
Sure.

222
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,250
I'm sorry if I startled you.

223
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,875
You know, we're not supposed to be here.

224
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,792
Rules are there to be
broken though, aren't they?

225
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,458
Not around here, they're not.

226
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,375
Are you feeling all right?

227
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,292
Why do people keep asking me that?

228
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,875
When was the last time
you looked in a mirror?

229
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,292
What do you do here?

230
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,667
Humans think they're
so important, don't they?

231
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,458
I said what do you do here, your job.

232
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,583
From up here, you see
them as they really are.

233
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,750
No more important than rats.

234
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,833
Always fucking with each other.

235
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,167
Like people need to fuck with other people

236
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,917
just to feel good about themselves.

237
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,792
You know what I mean?

238
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,458
I digress.

239
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:23,750
I work in a very specialized field.

240
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,792
I'm a mediator.

241
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,542
A mediator?

242
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,375
Mmm.

243
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,500
Oh, Edward.

244
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,833
You deserve better than this.

245
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,417
You are not like them.

246
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,000
Like who?

247
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,458
The rats.

248
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:55,500
Who are you?

249
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,125
You know exactly who I am.

250
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,375
You better run along, or you'll
be late for your meeting.

251
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,375
I'm always around, if
you want to talk later.

252
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,833
Where is that report?

253
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:47,917
Ah.

254
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:53,542
Guys, I'm gonna be in
a meeting till 11:30.

255
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,708
Okie-dokie.

256
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,833
Have either of you seen
anybody stepping around my desk?

257
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,083
When?

258
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:58,792
I dunno, whenever.

259
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,958
No, I haven't seen anyone.

260
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,083
How about you?

261
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,667
No.

262
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, who's your daddy?

263
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,042
You're late.

264
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,083
Nice one.

265
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,375
Punctuality is the soul of
all business, remember that.

266
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,292
Now, get out.

267
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,417
I'm fucking with you, take a seat.

268
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,875
You said 10:30, Silas.

269
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:41,792
No.

270
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,333
I'm sure I said 10:15.

271
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,292
Both of you, shut up.

272
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,917
Yes, sir.

273
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,042
While we were waiting for you, Ed,

274
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,958
Silas brought up some issues he has

275
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,667
regarding the user experience
for the KBank application.

276
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,333
Sure.

277
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,500
He's new blood, pick his brains.

278
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,042
You're never too experienced
to learn new things.

279
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,625
I don't think that's the best--

280
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,625
You're familiar with Bill Gates, right?

281
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,208
Of course.

282
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,417
Mark Zuckerberg?

283
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,833
Yes.

284
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:08,750
Retards.

285
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,250
I was developing accounting software

286
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,875
when I was nine years old.

287
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,333
I started this business
when I was 15 years old,

288
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,750
and I didn't make the Fortune 500

289
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,750
not knowing what was best
for my own goddamned company.

290
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,958
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

291
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,750
You think I'm that easily offended?

292
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,500
I, um--

293
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:29,458
You apologizing for offending
me is fucking offending me.

294
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,125
I'm sorry.

295
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,833
Relax, Ed, I'm just fucking with you.

296
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,583
Oh man, just trust me on this, okay?

297
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,250
Okay.

298
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,375
Not that I'm giving
you much of a choice.

299
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,667
Anyway.

300
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,750
Now, I had Keith over in New Business

301
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,000
conduct a feasibility study last week,

302
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,833
and he doesn't seem to
think there is any need

303
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,708
for us to outsource any more design work.

304
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,167
So, I'm appointing Silas as team leader.

305
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:58,833
Team leader?

306
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,500
I love it When you die.

307
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,708
Any questions?

308
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,542
Yeah, Ed?

309
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:28,750
Ehm, yeah, team leader.

310
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,375
Yes.

311
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:30,958
Team leader.

312
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,125
Oh, boo.

313
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,458
No, don't be an asshole about it, Silas.

314
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,125
You said work under Silas.

315
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,000
Before, you said with Silas.

316
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,542
Ed, technically it's--

317
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,167
Technically, you will be temporarily

318
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,292
working under him, but
it doesn't mean anything.

319
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,333
This is all about what's best

320
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,250
for our company and our customers.

321
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,917
We've got a lot of work to do, Ed.

322
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,458
Yes, you do.

323
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:53,958
We're in a lot of trouble.

324
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,875
We've just lost three
of our biggest clients

325
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:56,875
in the last two months.

326
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:57,708
I know.

327
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,875
People just aren't spending money

328
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,792
like they used to, and I don't blame them.

329
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,333
Can't compete with the Far East,

330
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:07,458
so this is really about
our reputation, our brand.

331
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,000
Now, I've had to make some

332
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,292
really tough decisions in recent months.

333
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,875
I've had to let a lot of good people go.

334
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,667
Not because they weren't
good at their jobs.

335
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,083
A couple of 'em were phenomenally shitty,

336
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,167
but for the most part, it's
because we can't be overstaffed.

337
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,500
I would hate to see
the same happen to you.

338
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,042
Or you, Silas.

339
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,000
You're lucky you've got brains.

340
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:47,583
Edward.

341
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,000
David.

342
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,875
Mr. Arkham, how you doing?

343
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:09,792
I'm good.

344
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,083
Are you looking for something?

345
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,542
No, not really.

346
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,792
I was just being nosy.

347
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,333
Nosy?

348
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,167
Well, I'm a director, Edward.

349
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,042
Above you, if you remember.

350
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,250
Well, a few floors below
you in this building.

351
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,958
A few floors up in the old food chain.

352
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,750
A few floors
up in the food chain?

353
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,250
That doesn't even make
sense, you fucking moron!

354
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,375
If you know what I mean.

355
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,792
How could I forget?

356
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,667
No, I've actually come up here

357
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,417
to ask for your help on something.

358
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,958
At your service.

359
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:41,792
Well, I don't know if you know,

360
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,250
but I'm conducting an internal audit.

361
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,958
Yeah, I heard.

362
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,125
Well, what I'd like you to do

363
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,625
is to create a report on
the efficiency of your team

364
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:54,083
and the processes and the
procedures that you employ.

365
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,792
Well--
- Also, if you could add

366
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,125
a few notes and how
things could be improved,

367
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,292
that'd be a great help.

368
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,292
You know--
- Shouldn't take you

369
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,167
no longer than a day or two.

370
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,083
So, you want me to
conduct an audit for you?

371
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,875
No, not exactly.

372
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,542
I'll be conducting the audit.

373
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,708
You'll just be helping me out.

374
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,917
So, what do you think?

375
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,875
I've got a lot on at the moment.

376
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm not sure I've got the time.

377
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,958
Well, I need this by middle
of next week, the latest.

378
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,417
So, I'd like you to drop everything

379
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,458
that you are doing and do this for me, Ed.

380
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,042
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

381
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:35,333
And Ed, let's just keep this
between ourselves, yeah?

382
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,458
Sure.

383
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,292
I'm gonna be slipping out
a little bit early today.

384
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,667
Got a little bit on the side,

385
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,208
take them away for the weekend.

386
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:46,625
Anywhere nice?

387
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:48,792
Nah, not really.

388
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,583
Let's not forget what
we spoke about, yeah?

389
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:53,500
I won't.

390
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,667
Hello babe, give us a kiss.

391
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,292
You smell lovely.

392
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,750
You sloth.

393
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,458
I'm not gonna be one of his slaves.

394
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,375
You know, it's not cows on the bus.

395
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,792
They've been lovers for years.

396
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:18,792
I know, but someone has
to do something about him.

397
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,417
Well, go kick his ass, then.

398
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,625
You'd be doing a great
service to every employee

399
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,083
of this company if you
decided to take a stand.

400
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:47,333
Have either of you guys
got any moisturizing cream?

401
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:51,083
Why, you're planning on
making love to your own hand?

402
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,500
If it's serious, maybe
you should see a doctor.

403
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,417
It's just dry skin.

404
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,333
Laura?

405
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,250
Dear Laura, fuck off and die.

406
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,958
Why don't you go down on me?

407
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:49,625
Why don't you swallow, swallow?

408
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,375
Guys, I'm gonna go for a bit of lunch.

409
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,708
Swallow what?

410
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:23,292
Feel I'm with my wisdom
from the darkness

411
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:33,292
Stop, it's coming closer

412
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,500
Rye, one on a toasted bagel,

413
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,208
and the rest on white.

414
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,500
Okay, and a salad also?

415
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,708
Eh, don't know, didn't say.

416
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:45,917
No, no salad.

417
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,500
What have I got so far?

418
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,292
Oh, chicken and bacon.

419
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:54,833
So, ham and cheese on
brown with mayo, no butter.

420
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:56,958
Now, can you make sure
there's no butter at all?

421
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,375
Because he's lactose intolerant,

422
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,708
and you just can't have butter.

423
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:01,542
Okay.

424
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,625
Oh, for for fucks sake.

425
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:04,833
Right, that's it.

426
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:07,250
Oh, sorry, and one Caesar
salad, and that's it.

427
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,208
Oh no, no.

428
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:09,250
That's so silly.

429
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,542
We're missing a salmon and
cream cheese on a bagel, yeah.

430
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,542
Caesar bagel, has to be Caesar's.

431
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,250
Right, I'll sort this out.

432
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,333
Hello, my dear.

433
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,458
How are we this afternoon?

434
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,958
I'm very well, thank you.

435
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:41,792
Finally.

436
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,042
What can I get for my favorite customer?

437
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:48,292
I need six salads, three
potato, with one chicken Caesar,

438
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,417
one normal Caesar, and one crayfish salad.

439
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,750
Vitton, do we have any crayfish left?

440
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,417
I'm sorry.

441
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,583
And one ham and cheese and mustard.

442
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,167
Oh, my God.

443
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,500
Did you see what happened?

444
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,917
Half an hour to get a bloody sandwich.

445
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,542
Ed?

446
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,458
What?

447
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,875
Can I?

448
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,542
If you take my calculator one more time,

449
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,292
I'm gonna cut your hand
off, shove it up your arse.

450
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,458
What is wrong with you?

451
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,958
I seriously think you
should see someone, Ed.

452
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:54,833
Maybe a doctor.

453
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:58,958
Asshole.

454
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:01,583
I only said it because I care.

455
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,625
I wasn't talking to you.

456
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,417
Although you're an asshole, too.

457
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,500
What the?

458
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,958
He's just messing with me.

459
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,917
I've seen this stuff before.

460
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,208
What?

461
00:43:56,042 --> 00:44:01,042
Steven, have you met new
guy around here called

462
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,250
Nicholas Lemarchand?

463
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,875
It does sound vaguely familiar.

464
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:08,750
So, you've met this guy.

465
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,542
I didn't say that.

466
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,083
I said the name sounds familiar.

467
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,458
Pablo, how about you?

468
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,167
Who?

469
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,542
Nicholas Lemarchand.

470
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,375
Nicholas Lemarchand?

471
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,250
Have you met a guy
called Nicholas Lemarchand?

472
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,417
No, doesn't ring a bell.

473
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,250
What's wrong with you?

474
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,583
I dunno.

475
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,500
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

476
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,333
You're not losing your mind.

477
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:45,458
It's just been a rough week, that's all.

478
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:52,292
Now, my uncle, he lost it, totally.

479
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,875
One day, he got into
the neighbor's backyard

480
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,583
and raped their dog.

481
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,833
That poor dog, he fucked it up for life.

482
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,625
After, he wouldn't eat a drink

483
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,625
for, like, two weeks, and then he died.

484
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:09,958
He raped a dog.

485
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,208
Yes.

486
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:15,292
And after that he shot
himself up the ass, and he died.

487
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,333
Why'd he shoot himself up the arse?

488
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:19,083
He was so messed up in his head.

489
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,125
He thought there was a
demon living up his ass,

490
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,417
so he tried to shoot it.

491
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,792
A demon up his arse?

492
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:29,750
A demon.

493
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:33,750
I need a cigarette.

494
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:57,667
My day.

495
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,625
Whore.

496
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,458
You can do a lot better than her, Ed.

497
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:16,375
You know that.

498
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,333
Remember that weird birthmark?

499
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,167
Not very attractive.

500
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,042
Why don't you mind
your own bloody business?

501
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,042
I'm just telling it as it is.

502
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,458
So, what's the deal with that video?

503
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,292
That's you.

504
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,708
It looks a lot like me.

505
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:47,333
Ed, sometimes you're not
supposed to understand things.

506
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,458
The world bears many mysteries.

507
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,125
Whatever it is you're trying to do,

508
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,708
you'd better stop, right now.

509
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,500
I mean you know harm, Ed.

510
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,958
So, what do you want from me?

511
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,333
Why don't you tell me?

512
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,417
This is crazy.

513
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:18,625
Birthmark?

514
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:19,625
How do you?

515
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:33,375
2,000 highly skilled IT professionals,

516
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:36,792
who will customize our
revolutionary solutions.

517
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:37,625
Hey, Mikey.

518
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh.

519
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,458
Sorry, mate.

520
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:42,833
Hey, have you heard about the suicide?

521
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:43,667
No.

522
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,583
Goldberg Finch.

523
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,333
Guy jumps out the 11th floor.

524
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,167
Really?

525
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,750
Yeah, everybody's
talking about it.

526
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,083
Listen, I need your help with something.

527
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,500
There's this guy, Nicholas Lemarchand.

528
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:55,792
Met him in the kitchen this morning.

529
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,583
I don't know who he is, but
I don't think he works here.

530
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,792
He's been harassing me all day.

531
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:01,625
Harassing you?

532
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:02,333
In what way?

533
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:03,500
I dunno, he's weird.

534
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,708
Asking me questions about things.

535
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,000
I thought he might be a security risk.

536
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,292
Well, you've come to the right man.

537
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,792
Better to be safe than sorry, eh?

538
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,875
Yeah, I thought that.

539
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,583
Let's check the old visitors list.

540
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:17,583
You said you met him in
the kitchen this morning.

541
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,167
What time was that?

542
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,042
About nine?

543
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,708
Nine.

544
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,542
What does he look like?

545
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,250
Gray hair, 40s, suit, well-dressed.

546
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:30,083
I'll tell you what, I'll check
out the surveillance video.

547
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:32,083
Once I got a visual on him, he
won't be able to track down.

548
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:34,083
Have you seen him anywhere else?

549
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,333
No.

550
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:36,542
You sure?

551
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:37,458
Yeah.

552
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,917
Ed, I meant to say this morning.

553
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,708
Are you all right?

554
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,583
You just don't see yourself at the moment.

555
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,208
I'm fine, I'm just a bit stressed.

556
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,625
Don't let the bastards get you down.

557
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:49,583
Life's too short.

558
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:52,375
Cheers, mate.

559
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,750
All right, mate.

560
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,875
So, are you coming tonight, Ed?

561
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,417
Are you okay?

562
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,917
Sorry, I don't feel so good.

563
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,125
No, Ed.

564
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,667
It's my birthday, you're coming.

565
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,542
And you are already on the list.

566
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:07,833
Seriously?

567
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:11,417
You're coming, and that's that.

568
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,583
I need you as a wing man.

569
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,375
All right, just for a few.

570
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,292
Cool, I'll see you there.

571
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:25,167
So beautiful, so innocent.

572
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,625
I'd fuck her like my
uncle fucked that dog.

573
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,500
It's Christian, get up.

574
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,083
You look a little pale.

575
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm fine.

576
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:49,333
Please accept my apologies
for this morning.

577
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:51,250
No, no, look, don't worry
about any of that, all right?

578
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,833
I know you guys are
under a lot of pressure.

579
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,500
I've been there myself.

580
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:55,958
Just don't let it get to you.

581
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:59,083
I don't wanna see you
jumping out any windows.

582
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,458
You hear about that?

583
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:02,208
Banker that jumped out of his window,

584
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,208
happened just around the corner.

585
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,708
Hmm.
- Anyway, I need you focused.

586
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,750
What's going on with
Silas, you getting along?

587
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,375
I haven't heard from him yet.

588
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:11,833
You gotta be proactive, man.

589
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,167
Pick up the phone, sometimes people

590
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,542
just need a little tickle.

591
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:16,250
A tickle?

592
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,917
Yeah, you know, a little tickle.

593
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,333
Yes, sir.

594
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,542
KBank is a very big client.

595
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,250
I don't wanna risk losing them.

596
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,417
Everything's gotta be perfect.

597
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,125
I know he's an asshole, okay?

598
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:30,625
But I really liked his ideas.

599
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:31,833
I figured I would give him a shot.

600
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,708
I did the same for you not so long ago.

601
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:34,833
But they were my ideas.

602
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,958
I discussed them with him at
the beginning of the week.

603
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:37,917
I'm flying back to the States,

604
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,708
and I'm gonna be back in a month.

605
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,750
I need to see some
results, you understand?

606
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,583
Yes.

607
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,958
Be a little more focused.

608
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,625
Hello there, sir.

609
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:46,875
That's funny.

610
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,625
I just came down to speak to Ed.

611
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:49,708
Speak of the devil.

612
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,667
I emailed you earlier on today, Ed,

613
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,833
and you didn't get back to me.

614
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:55,958
Why's that?

615
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:58,792
I never got your mail.

616
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,083
You sure?

617
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,667
Have you checked your
deleted items folder?

618
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,083
You might have deleted it by accident.

619
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:07,500
All right, I suggest that you guys rest

620
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,958
or do whatever it is you gotta do

621
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,625
to make sure you're ready
to work on Monday morning.

622
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:13,208
Or we could start tonight.

623
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,167
Silas, I love your enthusiasm.

624
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,833
Thank you, sir.

625
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:19,042
Get your shitty nose outta my ass.

626
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:21,333
Excuse me, sir.

627
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:22,917
See you guys in a month.

628
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,625
I'm expecting big things.

629
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,917
I'll walk out with you, sir.

630
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I've actually got a few new ideas.

631
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,125
Silas.

632
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,542
Brown-nose little prick!

633
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:49,625
I've got that Friday feeling.

634
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:53,750
I seriously don't feel so good.

635
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:56,458
You'll be okay, once
you got some girls on you.

636
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,958
Hmm?

637
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,542
Let's get out of here now.

638
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:03,042
Yeah, I guess.

639
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:20,917
Yeah?

640
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,750
Ed?

641
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:22,583
It's me, Mikey.

642
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:23,917
Yeah, have you got anything from me?

643
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,708
Kind of.

644
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,500
What do you mean?

645
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,792
Well, I had a look at
the surveillance video,

646
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:34,167
and, well, you're the only
person that was in the room.

647
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,000
No, that's impossible.

648
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,083
You sure you looked at the right day?

649
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:38,750
Oh yeah, I'm sure, yeah.

650
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,000
I thought it was a little strange,

651
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,667
so I had a look at the
footage for the whole day,

652
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,292
but that's the only time
that you was in the kitchen.

653
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:47,167
In the video, your back's to the camera,

654
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,417
but it still looks like you
are talking to somebody.

655
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,375
Then, you make yourself a cup of coffee,

656
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:54,167
take a sip, you put it
down, and then you leave.

657
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,000
I don't even drink coffee.

658
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,917
Well, as you go to leave, it looks like

659
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,875
you're gonna collapse like
you've gone dizzy, or something.

660
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:05,958
Look, are you all right Ed?

661
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,833
You looked really sick when I saw you.

662
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,042
Ed?

663
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,833
Ed.

664
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:32,250
Have you ever seen something
that wasn't really there?

665
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,667
Or something that nobody
else could see, a person?

666
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:41,750
You just need to get drunk.

667
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,542
You know, you've been
acting weird all day.

668
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:08,000
And now, with this seeing things shit?

669
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:12,083
I've got this rash, and
it's really bugging me.

670
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,000
Rash?

671
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:14,958
It's not--
- I got stung

672
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:17,708
by something this morning, and
I haven't felt right since.

673
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,583
It must be some kind of reaction to it.

674
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:21,208
You should get that checked out.

675
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,750
Maybe you're allergic.

676
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,750
You're beginning to sound like Steven.

677
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:30,292
I'll leave it until tomorrow.

678
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:33,292
If it's not right then,
I'll go and see a doctor.

679
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,042
I'm sure it's nothing a
few vodkas won't cure.

680
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,208
Style creator, number-one hater

681
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:40,292
Style creator, number-one hater

682
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,500
Style creator, number-one hater

683
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,833
Style creator, number-one hater

684
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:46,792
Style creator, number-one hater

685
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:50,875
Number one hater, Number one hater

686
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,750
So, I heard they kick Snodgrass,

687
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:54,833
after Tim's last birthday party.

688
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:57,125
It was at that shit hole
bar around the corner.

689
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,083
Bar Mambo.

690
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:58,917
Bar Mambo.

691
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,167
I know, wanna know why?

692
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,583
Yeah, go on.

693
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:04,667
Snodgrass goes in there and
gets shit-faced, as usual.

694
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,250
But I mean the kinda faced
that would put you in a coma.

695
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,083
Yeah.

696
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,583
So always a couple of girls at a table,

697
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,750
drinking a bottle of
champagne, having a nice time,

698
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,375
minding their own business.

699
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,917
Snodgrass goes up to one of
them and starts talking to her.

700
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But she's like.

701
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:17,833
Fuck off.

702
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,333
Fuck off.

703
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,917
He doesn't take too
kindly to this, however.

704
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,625
Grabs a bottle of her
hand, necks it in one go,

705
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,292
drops his pants, and starts
taking a in the ice bucket.

706
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,667
Now way.
- Seriously, man.

707
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,208
Apparently, when the bouncer came across

708
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,208
to kick him out, he was still shitting.

709
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,292
So, how you're feeling now?

710
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,792
Yeah, I feel better, yeah.

711
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,250
Here, try some of this.

712
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:52,667
It tastes like shit.

713
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,500
The worse it tastes, the better it is.

714
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,500
Hm, yeah.

715
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,042
Hoo.

716
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:10,833
It's 9:30.

717
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:12,208
Let's do it.

718
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:14,333
Style creator, number one hater

719
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,208
Try some of that.

720
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:51,708
Yeah, that's good.

721
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,583
Told you it was here.

722
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:59,583
I'm gonna take a piss,
I'll see you in there.

723
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,125
Can I help you?

724
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,792
No, I'm fine, thanks.

725
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,375
Talk to the lady.

726
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:17,875
Are you on a guest list?

727
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,250
Yes, we're with Sams and Spruce.

728
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,083
We?

729
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,708
It's Edward Arkham.

730
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,167
I'm here for my friend's birthday.

731
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:26,500
Hmm.

732
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:30,875
No, I can't seem to find
your name on my list.

733
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,375
Sorry, there's nothing.

734
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,458
Do you have any girls with you?

735
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,208
No, we're meeting a
bunch of girls inside.

736
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,750
Like I said, we're with Sams and Spruce.

737
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:45,000
Well, I'm afraid I can't
let you in this evening.

738
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:45,875
Why not?

739
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,125
You're not on my list.

740
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:48,542
Are you serious?

741
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,750
Sorry, not tonight.

742
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,250
Hey.
- Hey.

743
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,000
Hey.
- Hey, how ya doin'?

744
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,583
Nice to see you.

745
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:57,792
Members.

746
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,042
My name is on the list.

747
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:00,167
Look, you've heard the lady.

748
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,708
Just go somewhere else.

749
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,125
Lemme talk to the manager.

750
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,875
Sorry, the manager is
unavailable at the moment.

751
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,333
You can try again tomorrow.

752
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:11,250
Why don't you just go home?

753
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:14,792
Why don't you eat shit and die,

754
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,625
you uneducated imbecile?

755
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:18,958
Do you realize how pathetic your job is?

756
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:20,375
Please, let me go.

757
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,208
Standing outside a
door, wearing some cheap,

758
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,500
shitty suit, trying to look important?

759
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,875
Please.

760
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,208
I'm on the list.

761
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,542
I'm on the fucking list.

762
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:33,292
What do you say I go through it?

763
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,333
Townsend?

764
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,042
Ladies, this is Edward.

765
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:03,542
Hi.

766
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,542
Ed, have you met Anton?

767
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:36,917
Ed, Ed?

768
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,542
What are you on?

769
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:43,250
It looked like.

770
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,583
What are you doing here?

771
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:49,458
Are you okay?

772
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:50,667
I'm fine.

773
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,708
I saw you on the bar.

774
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:53,792
I just thought I'd come over and say hi.

775
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,417
So, how have you been?

776
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,625
You look shitfaced.

777
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:58,958
That's because I'm shitfaced.

778
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,792
Ed, why do you do it to--

779
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,750
Who are you here with?

780
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:04,958
Just this guy I've been seeing.

781
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,250
Yeah, what's his name?

782
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,542
Tye, you kind of met
him before, actually.

783
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,458
Are you okay?

784
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,750
Why haven't you called me?

785
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:22,792
I thought we were gonna be friends.

786
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:23,708
Hi.

787
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:25,958
I know it must be a bit awkward

788
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:26,958
Are you serious?

789
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:28,833
Ed we talked about this,
why can't you just forget?

790
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:30,083
I have forgotten about it.

791
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,083
You're the one who keeps emailing me

792
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:32,625
and sending me messages.

793
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,875
Because you said--

794
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,375
I don't wanna be your friend, all right?

795
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,958
I can't believe you'd be okay with this.

796
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:38,583
It's not my fault.

797
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:39,583
Fuck you.

798
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:41,833
Let's go.

799
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:56,667
Oh, sorry.

800
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,917
Let me get you a drink.

801
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,042
Watch yourself.

802
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,833
It was an accident.

803
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,542
What are you having?

804
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,500
How are you doing, Ed?

805
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,917
What's happening to me?

806
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,917
Huh, how are you doing this?

807
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,458
Huh?

808
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,625
What have you done to me?

809
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:47,375
I haven't done anything to you.

810
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:56,958
That looks nasty.

811
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:58,958
You oughta get some cream for that.

812
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,708
Why is this happening to me?

813
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,208
You're the smart one.

814
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:12,042
A senior software analyst,
looking out for yourself.

815
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:17,000
I meet you for the first
time in my life this morning.

816
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,833
You start asking me all these questions,

817
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:21,375
then all this weird stuff
starts happening to me.

818
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:23,292
And now, this.

819
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,542
This, whatever this is.

820
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:29,750
Are you saying this is my fault?

821
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,000
You made all the choices.

822
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,833
No one made them for you.

823
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,792
This is all your own creation.

824
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,250
My own creation?

825
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:50,000
You really have no idea, do you?

826
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:58,583
Ed.

827
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,875
I'm afraid you're fucked.

828
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:05,625
Ed.

829
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,708
Been looking for you everywhere.

830
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:12,917
What's the matter, Ed?

831
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,167
Ah, not talking to me.

832
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,542
Leaving already?

833
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,458
Very sensible.

834
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:38,583
Thanks for coming.

835
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:55,708
Ed.

836
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,500
There you are.

837
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,917
I need another drink

838
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,333
Fuck off, Pablo.

839
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,250
What?

840
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,792
He is totally gone.

841
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,000
Ed?

842
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,042
Ed.

843
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:12,958
Look, I'm worried about him.

844
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,458
What if he gets mugged or something?

845
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:15,833
He'll be all right.

846
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:16,917
Please, go after him.

847
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,333
We can drop him off on the way to mine.

848
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:21,708
Look, I'll never forgive myself
if something happens to him.

849
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,542
Edward.

850
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:40,458
What?

851
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:45,167
Edward.

852
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,083
What?

853
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,333
Edward.

854
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,958
Shut up.

855
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:50,875
Shut up.

856
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,083
Edward.

857
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,083
Tye.

858
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:18,375
Tye.

859
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,833
Why'd you come after me?

860
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,083
Emergency operator.

861
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:34,458
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

862
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,833
I'm on St. Marcus's Passage, E1.

863
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:41,458
Please, please come quickly.

864
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,625
Why'd you come after me?

865
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:12,792
It's not my fault.

866
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,417
Fuck you.

867
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:57,167
Ed?

868
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,125
Ed?

869
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,917
You're awake.

870
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,667
Where am I?

871
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:20,167
Well, Edward, you've had
quite a nasty knock on the head.

872
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,417
One of your neighbors found you

873
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,542
lying outside your apartment.

874
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,375
What's the last thing you remember?

875
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:34,917
Nothing.

876
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,333
I can't remember anything.

877
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,000
Do you know what your name is?

878
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,333
I heard you called me Edward.

879
01:16:44,417 --> 01:16:46,083
Yes, you told the paramedics

880
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,542
your name was Edward. When
they resuscitated you.

881
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,292
Resuscitated me?

882
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,625
Let me fetch you a doctor.

883
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,667
Time heals all wounds, Edward.

884
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:28,958
What happened to me?

885
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:33,917
You received a nasty knock to the head.

886
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:37,958
But you're gonna be fine.

887
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,042
Who are you?

888
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:49,042
We've had this conversation before.

889
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,500
Nicholas Lemarchand.

890
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,500
Your hand, it's freezing.

891
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,458
I'm Dr. Rathkin, by the way.

892
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:05,750
.I've been treating Edward for some time.

893
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:06,833
Is he okay?

894
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:10,917
He suffered a minor skull
fracture due to a heavy fall.

895
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,958
He has a concussion, but he
should make a full recovery.

896
01:18:14,042 --> 01:18:17,333
He was in an awful state when
he arrived, very distressed.

897
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:19,167
Mumbling about some sort of rash

898
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,375
that had apparently
spread across his body.

899
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:23,667
Ed.

900
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,708
You look like shit.

901
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,250
Why do you torture
yourself like this, Ed?

902
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,500
Yes, his condition seems to have

903
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:38,958
deteriorated quite significantly.

904
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:41,875
You remember me?

905
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,708
I remember.

906
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:49,500
Steven.

907
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,833
We're here for you, Ed.

908
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:53,167
We're not going anywhere.

909
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:57,833
At our last session,
Edward exhibited symptoms

910
01:18:57,917 --> 01:19:01,042
indicating a kind of psychosis.

911
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:03,042
As far as I can ascertain,

912
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:06,333
Edward has a form of
paranoid schizophrenia.

913
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:08,417
Half an hour to get a bloody sandwich.

914
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,625
This calculator is mine.

915
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,708
You know what brought it on?

916
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:16,542
Laura?

917
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:17,542
Some people just crack

918
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,167
under the strains of life.

919
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:22,792
Edward came home one night
to find his girlfriend

920
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:26,667
in a compromising situation,

921
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,333
and that was enough to
push him over the edge.

922
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:31,042
Alcohol and illegal substances

923
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,208
didn't exactly help his mental stability.

924
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,292
I've got something
that will get you in the mood.

925
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,167
Try some of that.

926
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,500
Presumably, he's on medication.

927
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:43,583
Oh yes, indeed.

928
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:45,625
I had him on antipsychotics.

929
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:47,417
But when I saw him on Tuesday,

930
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,250
he accused me of trying to poison him,

931
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,708
said that he hadn't been
taking his medication.

932
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,250
I suspect he's been off
them for some time now.

933
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:03,708
Edward, you need to make a decision.

934
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,917
We can help you make it.

935
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:11,417
But you need to stay with us.

936
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,083
Going into cardiac rest.

937
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:46,792
Get a defibrillator in here, now.

938
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:52,542
Clear.
- Clear.

939
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:56,500
Clear. 

940
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,417
Clear.

941
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,417
Nothing, again.

942
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,917
Clear.

943
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,917
I have a
feeling we're gonna be seeing

944
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,250
a lot more of each other.

945
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,542
It's a dangerous place

946
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:42,625
And you'll know how to behave

947
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:48,708
He killed her heart

948
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:51,750
She took his soul

949
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:54,625
On the subject of cutting

950
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,708
It all feels numb

951
01:21:57,792 --> 01:22:00,583
When you can't was off the smell

952
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:03,542
You really don't want to live

953
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,250
You really just want to

954
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,500
You really just want to

955
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:11,625
So much blood

956
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,542
So much blood

957
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,625
So much blood

958
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:17,708
So much blood

959
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:19,417
Too much blood

960
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:24,500
Too much blood

961
01:22:26,917 --> 01:22:30,042
Where'd you get your delusions from

962
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,625
One, two, three, four

963
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:38,000
Where'd you get your delusions from

964
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:43,083
Where'd you get your delusions from

965
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,000
Blood in my eyes

966
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,500
I've got blood in my eyes

967
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:50,542
I've got blood in my eyes

968
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:54,500
I've got

969
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:57,542
Blood in my eyes

970
01:22:57,625 --> 01:22:59,708
Blood in my eyes

971
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,333
I've got blood in my eyes

972
01:23:02,417 --> 01:23:07,375
I've got blood in my eyes

973
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,958
Reconstructive surgery

974
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:15,042
You can specify how old you want to be

975
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:20,333
Snake heads

976
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:23,000
Snake heads

977
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:26,000
They're just snake heads

978
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:30,292
They're gonna get chopped off anyway

979
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:33,250
When men start mutilating
their favorite girls

980
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:37,917
Then something scary has
been let loose among us

981
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,417
I feel like an explosion,
the smoke, the sheet

982
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,958
Indescribable

983
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:50,042
Too much blood

984
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:58,333
Where'd you get your delusions from

985
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:02,500
Where'd you get your delusions from

986
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:04,875
Come on

987
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:10,333
Where'd you get your delusions from

988
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:15,083
Where'd you get your delusions from

989
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,042
Blood in my eyes

990
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,958
I've got blood in my eyes

991
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:22,917
I've got blood in my eyes

992
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,333
I've got
