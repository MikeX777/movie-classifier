1
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,626
- Come on, kid.

2
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
Man up, dude.

3
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,538
There we go.

4
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,839
Wes?

5
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,107
- Hey, Paul.

6
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,144
- So, the L1 deal is closing

7
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,280
and the partners are flying
into San Francisco.

8
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,148
- Okay.
- I hate to do this to you,

9
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,352
but you're the only one
I trust with this client.

10
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,587
I need you out there.

11
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,355
- Okay.

12
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:35,094
Look, Wes,
man to man, okay?

13
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:36,528
Are you gonna
be able to handle this?

14
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,830
- Yes. Why wouldn't I?

15
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,531
I have a good
handle on the account.

16
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,370
We'll be fine, Paul.

17
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,706
We'll be fine.

18
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,975
- Good.

19
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,694
<i>Hi, honey,</i>
<i>make sure to pick up</i>

20
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,795
<i>some cured meats.</i>

21
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,263
<i>And we're low on diapers.</i>

22
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,332
<i>Oh, and I need tampons too.</i>

23
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,267
<i>Go to Whole Foods for</i>
<i>the meats, don't go to Giant.</i>

24
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,802
<i>So, you'll have</i>
<i>to make two stops.</i>

25
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,103
<i>And you know what?</i>

26
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,739
<i>You mind just getting</i>
<i>everything for the week?</i>

27
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,574
<i>I'll text you the list.</i>

28
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,877
<i>Sweetie, sorry,</i>

29
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,044
<i>I forgot to add something</i>
<i>to the list.</i>

30
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,146
<i>Do you mind?</i>
<i>Did you leave already?</i>

31
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,214
- I did, yeah. What is it?

32
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,582
<i>So my father just reminded me</i>

33
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,584
<i>he needs his toilet paper.</i>

34
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,952
<i>Speaking of, they're hungry</i>

35
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,154
<i>and I want to</i>
<i>try to put Lizzie down</i>

36
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,788
<i>before my sister and Andy</i>
<i>show up.</i>

37
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,724
<i>So I'm just gonna serve</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

38
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:39,858
<i>But I have your plate ready.</i>

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,960
<i>I'll keep it covered, okay?</i>

40
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,829
<i>Okay. I'll take care of it.</i>

41
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,399
So, I said,
"I am not going out like that.

42
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,935
You know I'm not going out."
- Wes, oh, my God.

43
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,403
I'm sorry, honey.

44
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,838
We wanted to wait
for you, but we were starving.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
- You did remember
the diapers, did you?

46
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,643
- Yeah. Oh, I think
I left them in the car.

47
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:58,744
- I'll get 'em.

48
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,381
This isn't one-ply, is it?

49
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,752
You got to do something
about that dishwasher.

50
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,487
It just crapped out.

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,420
- Hah!

52
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,491
Hmm.

53
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,100
<i>You've reached Luke.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

54
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,268
<i>At the tone,</i>

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,003
<i>please record your message.</i>

56
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,438
<i>When you have finished</i>
<i>recording,</i>

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,674
<i>you may hang up</i>
<i>or press 1 for more options.</i>

58
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:08,113
- Hey, man, I don't know why
I've had so much trouble

59
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,883
reaching you for the past month.

60
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,187
Maybe you've been arrested?
Kidnapped?

61
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,221
Maybe you're dead?

62
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,156
I don't really give a fuck.

63
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,926
You should call me back.

64
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:29,301
But hopefully, you're out there
in that cesspool of silicone,

65
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,037
serving up manhood
in a more efficient manner

66
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,741
than I am here in suburbia,

67
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:41,613
where I am house dad to
not only my wife and kid

68
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,983
but also my in-laws.

69
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,018
One of whom just told me

70
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,452
I need
to get a bigger fucking house

71
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,522
so that he has more
bathrooms to shit in

72
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,823
and more room
to put his feet up.

73
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,164
Anyway, I won't be mad
about the hiding

74
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,933
if you
show up at this reunion, okay?

75
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,604
I've been drinking. Bye.

76
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:15,714
¶ Twinkle twinkle little star ¶

77
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,516
Yeah, you're tired.

78
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:22,487
¶ How I wonder what you are? ¶

79
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,771
<i>It's eczema,</i>
<i>not a skin rash.</i>

80
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,073
Make sure you tell the doctor.

81
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,774
- Fuck, is this
what I think it is?

82
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,609
- His ass? Yeah.

83
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,580
- Great. Thank you, honey.
Can't unsee that.

84
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,614
Oh.

85
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,150
And here's the bill
from last time.

86
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,185
That needs to be paid.

87
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,953
Make sure
they don't overcharge you.

88
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,592
- Goddamn!
A thousand dollars?

89
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,929
To treat skin
on an old man's ass?

90
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,130
- What do you want me to say?

91
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,967
It's my dad.

92
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,169
All right.

93
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,138
- Oh shit. Wes?

94
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,239
- Hmm-mm.

95
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,008
- Look at me.
- Hmm?

96
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,877
- I'm ovulating.

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,212
- Okay.

98
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,947
- Take your pants off.

99
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,382
Wait, okay. No--

100
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,816
Does that hurt?
- No, it's--

101
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,718
it-- it's good. It's fine.

102
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,719
- Okay.
- Just go ahead.

103
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,854
- All right.
- Okay.

104
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,188
<i>You reached Luke.</i>

105
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,823
<i>Leave a message.</i>

106
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,924
<i>At the tone,</i>

107
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,492
<i>please record your message.</i>

108
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,927
<i>When you have finished</i>
<i>recording,</i>

109
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,130
<i>you may hang up</i>
<i>or press 1 for more options.</i>

110
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,333
<i>You know, a month ago,</i>

111
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,937
<i>we sat here on the phone</i>
<i>while I bought you</i>

112
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,338
<i>a plane ticket to this reunion.</i>

113
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,907
<i>And you kind of laughed it off</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

114
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,375
<i>but you promised me you'd come.</i>

115
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,247
<i>So, hopefully, you are</i>
<i>coasting comfortably</i>

116
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,552
<i>at 30,000 feet,</i>
<i>on a red-eye right now.</i>

117
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,689
<i>I'm really looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing you, bud.</i>

118
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,826
<i>Could use a talk.</i>

119
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,260
Wes!

120
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,897
- Holy shit! Steve!
How are you, bud?

121
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,366
- How the hell you been, man?
- I'm good. I'm good. You?

122
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,134
- Well. Can't complain.

123
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,270
Still in Philly, workin'.
- Very nice.

124
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,172
- My wife and I
just had a little one.

125
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,974
- Congrats, man.
- Yeah. A baby boy. And--

126
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,075
- That's great.

127
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,877
- Yeah, thanks. It's...

128
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,247
- Yeah.

129
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,481
- How about--
how about you?

130
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:40,719
I heard you and Sarah Joyce
ended up getting married?

131
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,120
- We did.

132
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,489
- I could've said
that would happen.

133
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,725
You two.
You always had

134
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,494
a Ken and Barbie thing
goin' on.

135
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,831
- Here's your drink, darling.

136
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,299
- Thank you, my dearest.

137
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,700
- Hmm.

138
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,369
Who'd have thought
I could be so thoughtful?

139
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,570
- I know, seriously.

140
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,971
- Hmm.

141
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,323
- What did you do with my wife?

142
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,674
I don't know.

143
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,442
- I'll let you know
if I find her though.

144
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,678
- Thank you so much.
She has my credit cards.

145
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,192
- Is that Maggie Olson?

146
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,929
It is.

147
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,432
Is she comin' over here?

148
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,800
- I wish Luke was here.

149
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,570
How much did you
pay for those tickets?

150
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,405
- This is gonna be interesting.

151
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,406
- Hi, Sarah. Hey, Wes.

152
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,440
- Hey, Maggie.

153
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,808
- Maggie,
you look beautiful.

154
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,209
Thank you.

155
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,579
I-I hear you guys got married.

156
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,647
- We did.
Got married seven years ago.

157
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,049
- Hmm-mm.
- Not that anyone's counting.

158
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,216
- No.
- No.

159
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,184
- He's--
- Feels like yesterday.

160
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,218
Yeah.

161
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,320
- Still that
"angry old man-baby"

162
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,422
that I just tolerate,
so not much has changed.

163
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,459
- What about you?

164
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,728
- No, not married.
Still single.

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,096
- Got it.
Where are you now?

166
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,331
- I live up
in Portland, Oregon.

167
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,332
- Oh nice.
- Nice.

168
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,300
- Yeah, I really love it.

169
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,768
- What are you doin' up there?

170
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,903
- I'm a painter.

171
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,838
Which means I spend most
of my time bartending.

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,075
- Hey, beats
my concrete jungle.

173
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,244
- Um...

174
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,917
Is Luke here?

175
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,256
- No. H-he didn't make it.

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,027
- It's too bad.
Tell him I said hello.

177
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,423
- I'm gonna take
a couple of days off

178
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,091
on either side
of the meeting.

179
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,559
Get out west early.

180
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,262
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

181
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,463
Nothin's gonna
jeopardize the deal.

182
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,798
I just need some time.

183
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,206
- Why don't we try this?

184
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,576
I'll-I'll ramp right before

185
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,512
his first
chorus line on the beat.

186
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,848
And then
we'll intercut that motif

187
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,350
through the rest of the chorus.

188
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,154
Here, watch.

189
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,924
<i>- ¶ Rewind rewind it</i>
<i>Rewind-- ¶</i>

190
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:33,925
- Oh fuck!

191
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,261
Yes! Yes!

192
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,663
There's it!
The fucking GENIUS.

193
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,266
Right there,
the fucking GENIUS!

194
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,304
You did that in your sleep,
like a fucking Jedi.

195
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,906
Why can't Harold do that?

196
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,341
- Well, you better get
Harold to shape up,

197
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,576
because we
can't afford to keep asking Luke

198
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,712
to save the day
from his apartment.

199
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,247
Speaking of... Luke...

200
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,817
So we are over budget again.

201
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,819
But we can still pay you.

202
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,222
It's just a fraction of the rate
for the hours you've put in.

203
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,356
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,461
- You know what?
Don't worry about it.

205
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,565
I'll just... consider it
my goodbye present.

206
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,867
- Whatcha talking about?

207
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,020
I'll keep a spot open for you

208
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,855
in case you change your mind
at the last minute.

209
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,857
- Change your mind about what?

210
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,825
Wes?
- Okay. We should go.

211
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,293
Yeah, we're gonna project

212
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,963
all these wacky beams of light
in all different directions.

213
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,398
Like green, purple,
yellow, orange, red--

214
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
like a prism, you know?
- Cool.

215
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,618
- Yeah. Sure. Right?

216
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,035
I'm gonna put Beyonce
in a TransAm.

217
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,572
So it'll be like Beyonce,
meets Knight Rider,

218
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,608
meets Dark Side of the Moon.
- Hmm.

219
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,376
- Are you at CAA?
- No.

220
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,712
I-I'll call you.

221
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:01,813
- Come here, buddy.

222
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,414
- What the fuck
are you doing here, Wes?

223
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,949
- You don't answer
your goddamn phone,

224
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,552
so I'm takin'
matters into my own hands.

225
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,954
It's a nice spot.
About 700 square feet?

226
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,824
- Wes, what the fuck
is goin' on?

227
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,960
She's in Portland.

228
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,328
- What? Who?

229
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,429
- Maggie.

230
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,064
What? Maggie who?

231
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,166
- Your Maggie.

232
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,735
- What? My-my Maggie?
- Yeah. So, guess what?

233
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,236
We're going to Portland!

234
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,271
What?!

235
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,872
- Yeah.

236
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,674
We're gonna drive up to Portland
and we're gonna go see Maggie.

237
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,209
Well, you're gonna
go see Maggie.

238
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,377
And I'm just gonna

239
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,712
stand to the side... happily.

240
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,080
In the bushes or something.

241
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,749
- You're out
of your fucking mind.

242
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,584
She was at the reunion
and she was asking about you.

243
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,386
- She was--
she was asking about me?

244
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,672
- And I'm telling you,
it felt like

245
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,957
the sole reason
she was there was to see you.

246
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,759
And I've got business
up in San Francisco.

247
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,093
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.

248
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,929
And where are you goin'?
- I'm showering.

249
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,597
I'm hungry. Hurry up.

250
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,698
- Calm down.
- Thank you

251
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,166
for getting my luggage.

252
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,037
Very helpful
after a long flight.

253
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,573
You realize how long
of a drive it is to Portland?

254
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,074
- Yeah. It's 570 miles

255
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,376
from Santa Monica Pier
to Leggett.

256
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,611
That's 15 hours of driving.

257
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,946
I figure we cut in
at Lincoln City.

258
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,848
Then from Leggett to Portland,

259
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,318
is 520 miles,
11 hours of driving. So what?

260
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,154
We're talking 1,100 miles,
26 hours of driving.

261
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,726
- Even if we do manage
to get there,

262
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,294
how do we even find her?

263
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,696
- Well, I've done some digging.

264
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,097
She works in this cool place
up at Belmont.

265
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,833
I know where she lives, too.

266
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,471
You're starting to scare me.

267
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,839
- You have wife clearance
for this?

268
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,041
Yeah,
Sarah's totally fine with it.

269
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,209
- Yeah, right.

270
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,080
Speaking of, how is--
how's Lizzie?

271
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,415
- Oh, c'mon.
What else do you have to do?

272
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,886
You can't move home.

273
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,787
What the fuck are you
gonna do in Richmond?!

274
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,824
- Well, my brother
got me a sales job.

275
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,425
- No.
- Waste disposal.

276
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,027
- No.
- Recycling.

277
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,795
- Still no.
Are you kidding me?!

278
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,898
That is not a solution.

279
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,266
I'm not lettin' you do that.

280
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,106
- Shh, you-you reach
a certain age,

281
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,910
and being broke
is just - is a bad look.

282
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,412
It-it gets old
trailing behind everyone else.

283
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,249
- Since when do you care
about everyone else?

284
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,455
Listen,
whenever I get frustrated

285
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,823
with my own life...

286
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,260
I think about you.

287
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,962
I do.

288
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,397
Out here living for us all.

289
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,734
That's just the truth, man.

290
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,036
Can you handle that?

291
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,342
- You can stay at my place
until your meeting.

292
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,311
I'll take you out
here in LA every night.

293
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,314
We'll have a blast,
but I'm not going to Portland.

294
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,618
- Like the first part.
Hate the second part.

295
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,554
We'll go to Portland.

296
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,158
Oh!

297
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,695
I oughta grow out
my beard on this trip.

298
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,764
Nice fuckin' thick beard,

299
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,533
it's what
these LA chicks like, right?

300
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,869
Buy a flannel.

301
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,138
God knows I walk into
someplace with a blazer,

302
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,441
they think
I'm their fuckin' dad.

303
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,575
- Ts-ss.
- But I diss

304
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,677
the blazer and buy a flannel.

305
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,179
Grow out my nice thick beard,

306
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,982
and I'll look just like the
rest of these dirty idiots

307
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,385
with their flannels and beards.

308
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,721
What?

309
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,923
Your little Bukowski shtick

310
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,958
seems to be
workin' out just fine.

311
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,196
C'mon, you've gotten
more ass out here

312
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,498
than you ever did in college
by a multiple of a hundred.

313
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,566
- Yeah. Okay.

314
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,334
Who cares? I'm done.

315
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,037
- What does that mean?

316
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,139
- I'm-- I'm taking a break
from women.

317
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,408
- Uh-- what?

318
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,277
- Look, you won't understand.

319
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,946
- No, I can't say
I would understand.

320
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,081
'Cause absolutely nothing
about a good-looking,

321
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,118
single guy in LA
taking some vow of celibacy,

322
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,020
makes any sense to me,
whatsoever.

323
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,688
- Well, I'm-I'm tired.

324
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,256
- What?

325
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,025
- I haven't had sex
with a girl in six months.

326
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,594
And quite frankly,
I haven't wanted to.

327
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,429
- What is goin' on here?

328
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,098
What have you done
with my friend, Luke, huh?

329
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,299
You don't return your calls.

330
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,535
I buy you a ticket,
you don't fly out.

331
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,438
What's the deal?

332
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,642
- Look, uh... you're not here.

333
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,810
You don't know what it's like.

334
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,913
And-- sorry.
I'm sorry about the ticket.

335
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:29,981
- No, fuck the ticket!

336
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,082
I just want to know
what's going on?!

337
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,152
- I'm fine.
- Wow. Look at that!

338
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,690
Look at this jewel.

339
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,563
It's pure Cali right there.

340
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,402
Oh, man!

341
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,873
You know,
being here in this moment,

342
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,342
it just makes me
really, really happy

343
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,244
that places
like this still exist.

344
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,214
What?

345
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:09,787
Hey-hey.
Oh,.

346
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,857
You know
I really liked you. I did.

347
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,625
- Ah.
- And you're just an a-,

348
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,760
he's such an asshole.

349
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,429
Why were you so mean to me?

350
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,697
- I wasn't mean to you.

351
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,866
N-- I-I wasn't mean to her.
- You-- yeah, you were.

352
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,368
I thought you were a nice guy.

353
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,437
But you just
ended up being a jerk.

354
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,271
- Makes a lot of sense.

355
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,673
- He ended up
being a jerk.

356
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,041
- I totally
get that, and I'm sorry.

357
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,009
- Do you just
want to go home? Please?

358
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,211
Alright.
Mallory, we're going home.

359
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,812
- Do you want to go home?
- It's-it's time to go.

360
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,347
- No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,098
I'm just staying right there.
- Yeah, I'll um-um I'll-I'll-

362
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:37,848
I'll catch you later.
- Maybe-maybe

363
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,083
I'm gonna be over here.

364
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,118
- Yeah.
- I'm over--

365
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,119
- Catch you later.
- Bye. Okay.

366
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,553
I just-- okay.

367
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,455
- Oh, wow.

368
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,290
Luke, what
did you do to that poor woman?

369
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,092
No, I didn't do anything.

370
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,331
Okay, we were kinda
hookin' up for a while.

371
00:18:53,333 --> 00:19:00,705
And one night, she just starts
crying randomly, for no reason.

372
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,273
I couldn't get it out of her.

373
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,008
She wasn't even drunk.

374
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,078
And then, later
that night, I'm sleeping

375
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,914
and she-she tried to
stick her finger up my ass.

376
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,017
- Oh. That might've
done it for me.

377
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,051
Of course, it would.

378
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:18,556
S-so now
I'm the asshole and--

379
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,358
me, asshole forever.

380
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,397
- Uh-oh.

381
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,534
Look at this.

382
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,470
Come on,
you can't leave her like that.

383
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,684
Hmm-mm.

384
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,686
Hi.

385
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:22,887
- Hi.

386
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:33,731
A-- oh! Ah!

387
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,099
What?

388
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,635
- Oh, your-your breath from
the--

389
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,770
- What?
- The vomit.

390
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,505
- So fuckin' typical
of this city.

391
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,506
- Look, I'm sorry.

392
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,308
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're a fuckin' loser.

393
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,677
- Hey, hey, hey,
just take it easy, alright?

394
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,945
I took care of you all night.
- Hey, hey, no.

395
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,113
You're a nobody.

396
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,314
It's no wonder why
you're 30-something

397
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,083
alone in a one-bedroom
guesthouse

398
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,519
with nobody but a fuckin'
douchebag in a fuckin' robe.

399
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,590
You know, I just feel bad
for guys like you

400
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,225
because you'll never
have the capacity

401
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,128
to get your shit together
to bring somebody in.

402
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,196
- You know what? I'll--

403
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,664
I'll consider the source.
Thank you.

404
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,367
- Oh my God, that is
such a fucking cliché!

405
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,372
A 30-something-year-old dreamer
equals a fucking loser!

406
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,440
Loser!

407
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,276
Fuck!

408
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,378
Fuck!

409
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:31,856
<i>I just think it's time</i>

410
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,859
I settle into
something elsewhere.

411
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,527
- Luke, no.

412
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,896
That blackhole or whatever
that shit was in there,

413
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,197
that's why we got to go
to Portland.

414
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,166
- Oh, will you stop
with the Maggie stuff, please?

415
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,434
- No, Luke, I get it now. I do.

416
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,303
Your career right now, it sucks.

417
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,737
I see that.
You're not happy.

418
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,639
You haven't accomplished
what you want and that sucks.

419
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,141
But you just need
some positive momentum,

420
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,943
and if you get your ass
up that PCH with me--

421
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,279
yes, that's that one step.

422
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,281
That's that one fucking step
in the right direction.

423
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,749
And I promise you,

424
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,785
the momentum's gonna start
to turn in your favor.

425
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,228
- Okay.

426
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,532
- Fuck, yeah.
Pack your shit.

427
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,301
We leave in an hour.
Pack your shit.

428
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,336
- Where-where you're going?

429
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,137
Bring a jacket.

430
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,605
And bring
something nice, please?

431
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,428
- Wait-wait,
where you goin'?

432
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,832
- We're going
on a little college tour.

433
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,000
- Wait, what? Really?

434
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,603
- Why not?
We both look professorial!

435
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,641
Me more than you,
but we'll be fine.

436
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,764
Now tell me,
Luke, you got shit.

437
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,699
I got shit.
We're both in it. But--

438
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,436
You gotta admit, man,

439
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,070
it feels pretty good to
be back around this, huh?

440
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,975
Just look around.
And do this for me.

441
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,112
Close your eyes and sniff.

442
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,382
What do you smell?

443
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,419
- I smell ocean air.

444
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,221
Maybe a little beer.
- Yeah.

445
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,389
- Some dog shit.

446
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,458
- Little bit, yeah.

447
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,528
Now, is that--
is that strawberry lotion?

448
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,798
You've always been a sick fuck.

449
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,667
- What? Man, we're back.

450
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,801
We're here, right?

451
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,137
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

452
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,574
Oh, she's lookin' at you.

453
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,677
Did you learn
nothin' last night?

454
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,880
- No, this is different.
More wholesome.

455
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,748
Say somethin'. The first thing
that pops into your head.

456
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,250
Go, go, go!

457
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,485
- Hey.

458
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,621
Umm...

459
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,489
Do you know where we can get
some-some smoothies around here?

460
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,425
Smoothies? Umm...

461
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,559
Yeah.

462
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,761
Yeah, there's a smoothie
place called 'Blenders'

463
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,863
back on Pardall.

464
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,565
- Cool.
- Great. Yeah, thank you.

465
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,968
- Yeah.

466
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,971
- Welcome to I.V.!

467
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,142
- You just asked her
where to get some smoothies?!

468
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,378
- I believe I did.
- Yeah. Odd exchange.

469
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,547
- ¶ I said we're all gonna die ¶

470
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,482
¶ But I'll never believe it ¶

471
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:22,152
¶ I love this world
And I don't wanna leave it ¶

472
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,255
¶ Said that death is a deal ¶

473
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,589
¶ That you cannot refuse ¶

474
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:30,461
¶ But I love you girl
And I don't wanna lose you ¶

475
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,632
¶ Don't want a long ride ¶

476
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,602
¶ I don't wanna die at all ¶

477
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,106
¶ I wanna be the man
Who lives forever ¶

478
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:49,346
¶ I ain't never gonna die
And I want you to come ¶

479
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:53,183
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

480
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:57,087
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

481
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,791
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

482
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:04,662
¶ Whoo ooh ¶

483
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:08,432
¶ I said life is a tale
It begins and it ends ¶

484
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,900
- Alright.
Pay attention.

485
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:10,868
You may learn something.

486
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,202
You surfer pansies

487
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,138
need to put a little hair
on your chest.

488
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,342
So we're gonna drink some
aged distilled grain like men.

489
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,643
There we go.

490
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:23,147
To surfin' dudes with attitudes.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

491
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:26,584
Okay.

492
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,952
Okay.

493
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:28,986
Here we go, boss.

494
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,220
- Hey--
- Yeah!

495
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,822
- Come here.
- Alright. One second, yes?

496
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,391
- Oh! Lookie here!
- Oh, my God.

497
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,060
- The smoothie guys.

498
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,127
- You know this crew?

499
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,462
- Oh, not too well,

500
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,531
but it's just how
people do it in I.V.

501
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,066
- Yeah, it's an open-door
policy around here.

502
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:43,400
You come in, you party.

503
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,337
If you enter,
you gotta live it up.

504
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,105
- Live it up!
I.V. Baby!

505
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,074
- Yhoo!

506
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,043
- A couple
parties down the street

507
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,244
are gonna rage later.

508
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,379
- Yeah?
- Hmm-mm.

509
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,214
- We're in. Let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no.

510
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,616
- This is--
this is just our speed.

511
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,451
- No, no.
This is not just our speed.

512
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,885
- We need more speed.

513
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,488
Okay.

514
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,456
- You guys are funny.

515
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,825
What's your story?

516
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,060
- On a road trip. Headin'
up Highway 1 to Portland.

517
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,763
- Ah, that's sweeeeet.
Portland's so chill.

518
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,365
- Wait?
If you're going to Portland,

519
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,433
you going up the Coast
through Big Sur?

520
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,769
- You bet your sweet little
ass we are!

521
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,171
I-is not what I meant to say.
Yes, we are.

522
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,673
I'm not a sexist pig.
I promise.

523
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,010
I just noticed earlier
that you are-- um, have a-a--

524
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,911
yeah-yeah, things
are going well in that area.

525
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,880
Yeah. She does have a cute
little bubble butt, doesn't she?

526
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,281
She does.

527
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,484
- Well, we're trying to meet
some friends up there,

528
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,918
but we need a ride.

529
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,755
- Is that so?

530
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,790
Alright, well hey, you show us
some fun tonight,

531
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,492
we'll get you
where you need to go.

532
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,994
- Us?! Fun?!
Oh, that's--

533
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,396
- It's not
gonna b- No? Roblem.

534
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:46,463
- Hmm-mm.

535
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,065
- We bring all the fun.

536
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,603
Phh.

537
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,341
- Ah-oh, whoa.

538
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,946
No thanks.
Never touched the stuff.

539
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,281
- Wow, never?

540
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,849
I don't do mellow.

541
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,951
I'm a grown man, I drink scotch.

542
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,454
- Bullshit,
that's not the reason.

543
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:44,888
- What?

544
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,757
- It's because when he used to
smoke back in college,

545
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,159
he'd turn into
this paranoid mess.

546
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,928
- No. That is not true.

547
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,596
I once had to cradle him.

548
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,231
He thought he was an orange.

549
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,733
And he-he was afraid he was

550
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,668
gonna get peeled.

551
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,337
- That-- the orange incident
did happen.

552
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,705
- Well, you'll just have to fare

553
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,707
with the
boxed wine in the fridge.

554
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,609
- Of course,
you have boxed wine,

555
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,178
because you're a classy lady.

556
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,713
Yes. Thank you.

557
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,049
Excuse me.

558
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,327
- You know, you
don't have to be afraid of me.

559
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,828
I don't bite.

560
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,567
- Sold.

561
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,002
Hmm.

562
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,343
- I'm gonna
smoke a little ganja.

563
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,914
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Hmm-mm.

564
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,084
- Oh, it says
refreshing on the box.

565
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,153
This is exciting.

566
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,759
Very cool, Snoop.

567
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:56,960
- You should take a rip!

568
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,629
And just go be paranoid
in the corner.

569
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,598
- Yeah, what's your deal, Wes?

570
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,235
You look like
a very slick banker guy.

571
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,137
Are you from New York?

572
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,239
- Close. D.C. area.

573
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,641
- Hmm.

574
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,509
I bet your closet's
full of Brooks Brothers.

575
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,978
- No. No. No, no, no.

576
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,848
Brooks Brothers
is entry level shit.

577
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,516
Most of my shirts
are from Geneva.

578
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,517
Oh.

579
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,752
- Just the supple cotton

580
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:24,021
is better for my chest hairs.

581
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,923
All four of them?

582
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,292
- Wes makes a lot of money
in venture capital.

583
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,961
- Nah, I make a lot of money
being super boring.

584
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,964
- And what do you do?
Work at Smoothie King?

585
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,399
- A, well um--

586
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,167
- Luke edits music videos in LA.

587
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,268
- Oh, wow! That's so cool!
- Yeah.

588
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,403
- Yeah. So cool.

589
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,305
- He is not super boring!

590
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,606
Well, you know,

591
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,708
my mom always says
that you can't make a "life"

592
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,844
unless you do
what makes you happy.

593
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,178
- God bless your mother.

594
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:53,584
I'm guessing she's
a super-hot yogi milf.

595
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:55,619
She sure is!

596
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,387
I knew I was right.

597
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,323
So what's in Portland?

598
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,731
- Good question, Constance.

599
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:08,966
I'll answer it.

600
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:12,970
I happen to have run into
one of Luke's college pals

601
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:17,474
and she inspired
this little journey

602
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,575
up the coast.
- Oh.

603
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,444
- There's a girl up in Portland,

604
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,813
and you guys
are going to see her?

605
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,748
Was it an old
college girlfriend?

606
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,782
- It's a love quest.
- Hmm-mm.

607
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,750
- No, it's not a love quest.

608
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,851
- It's a love quest.

609
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,286
- It's a fuckin' love quest.
It is.

610
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,688
- Yeah, I highly doubt that.

611
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,490
- Yeah, don't pay
too much attention.

612
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:37,160
This guy over here is probably
already in love with you.

613
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,763
And fun fact, he's gonna
kill me for saying this,

614
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,266
but Luke here has
the largest collection

615
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:45,836
of romantic films
this si ssippi.

616
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:48,272
I caught him
on multiple occasions

617
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,073
jerking off
to <i>Notting Hill</i> in college.

618
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,576
You--
- Hugh Grant's sexy.

619
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,627
- You can't--
you can't unsee that.

620
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:54,677
Well, that is adorable.

621
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,582
So VHS or laserdisc?

622
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,583
- It's a poster.

623
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,989
Oh. Okay.

624
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,360
- You two have fun.

625
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,361
- You two have fun.

626
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,064
Not too much "fun".

627
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,836
- Hmm.

628
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:27,644
So,
did I do my job this evening?

629
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,446
- Yes, you did.

630
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,214
You have earned your free ride.

631
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,349
Yes.

632
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,262
- Ah.

633
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,065
- Come on.

634
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,368
- What?
- Dance with me.

635
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,303
Oh. More dancing.

636
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,938
- Hmm.
- Wonderful.

637
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,315
- Tell me something about you?

638
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,253
That only some random
college girl would know.

639
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,826
Tell me a secret.

640
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,494
Make it ours.

641
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:27,537
Well,
believe it or not,

642
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:34,044
this is one of the happier days
I've had in a very long time.

643
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,078
- Hmm.

644
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:38,582
This day isn't even over yet.

645
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,486
Hmm.

646
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,884
- Hello?

647
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,719
- Hey honey, it's me.

648
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,287
<i>Wes?</i>

649
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,622
What time is it?

650
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:23,093
- Well, almost six your time.

651
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,762
- Hmm. Is everything okay?

652
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,397
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

653
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,466
Everything's fine.

654
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,434
Just couldn't sleep.

655
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,036
How's Lizzie?

656
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,771
<i>Hmm. She's good.</i>

657
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,206
She misses her Daddy.

658
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,776
<i>Yeah.</i>

659
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,078
I miss her too.

660
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,684
Alright. Go back to bed.

661
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,685
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

662
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,455
- Hmm. I love you.

663
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:53,690
- I love you too.

664
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,544
Hmm.

665
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,131
- So, Wes, I heard
you're married?

666
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,466
Might explain why I didn't
get any last night, huh, buddy?

667
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,737
Oh, and you have a kid.
That's so cute!

668
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,439
She is.

669
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,207
Would be very proud of me
right now.

670
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,818
- ¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

671
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,222
- ¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

672
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:04,261
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

673
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:08,632
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

674
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,668
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

675
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,205
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

676
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:21,077
¶ Something that I can't hide ¶

677
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,915
¶ Put your hands in the sky ¶

678
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:29,186
¶ Love will make you feel high ¶

679
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:37,260
¶ Love will make you
Feel alive ¶

680
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,431
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

681
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:46,303
¶ Feel it in my bones ¶

682
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,826
- I literally have chills
right now.

683
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,428
- I told you. It's magical.

684
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:19,402
- I just want to look at this
and remember it.

685
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,245
Okay. We're good.

686
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,915
Mental snapshot
in my brain forever.

687
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,252
<i>And what's it like</i>

688
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,521
<i>being married to someone</i>
<i>you met when you were 19?</i>

689
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,491
It feels kind of
old fashioned these days.

690
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,762
- That's me.
Just an old 60's Chevy.

691
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,666
- The-the Bronco
suits you better.

692
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:58,241
- When you're young,
your heart is so big.

693
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:05,782
It's just racing to let in
every opportunity...

694
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,519
every feeling.

695
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,520
Everything.

696
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,558
But--

697
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,662
you don't really know
who you are at 19.

698
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:32,942
<i>I mean, don't you love</i>

699
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:33,910
<i>getting to be creative all day?</i>

700
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,914
Plus, why go
and leave all this behind?

701
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,290
- Well, what?
Should I come live with you?

702
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,527
- You'd do that?

703
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,762
- Sure. Why not?

704
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,832
I can totally see myself
with you.

705
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,400
- Oh yeah?

706
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,736
So, you'd just dive in with
some "enchanting" college girl

707
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,271
you met like 12 hours ago?

708
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,541
- You. Me. Here.

709
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,913
I can paint any beautiful
delusion for our future.

710
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,920
- See?

711
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:17,987
You really are romantic.

712
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,134
¶ This life of ¶

713
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:07,704
¶ Darlin' darlin' darling
You're my song ¶

714
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,239
Whoah!

715
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,574
- ¶ Darling you're my song ¶

716
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,845
- Hmm.

717
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:16,980
- What the fuck?

718
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,250
- Hmm.
What's goin' on, baby?

719
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:24,053
- Hey guys,
this is Charlie and Sev.

720
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,923
- Hello.
- Charlie.

721
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,691
What's up, brothers?

722
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,593
Thanks for giving
the goddesses a ride.

723
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,797
- Sure. Yeah.

724
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,998
- Beats an Uber.

725
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,334
- Yeah.

726
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,903
You guys should come with us.

727
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,773
We're going to grill some fresh
Ahi, smoke some green grasses.

728
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,741
Gonna camp out.

729
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,009
Join us.

730
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,514
- Yeah. No.
Ah, thank you, though.

731
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,250
- Yeah, we'll take
a raincheck on the tuna.

732
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,985
Gotta get goin'.

733
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,254
- Okay.
Chill! Well, safe journey.

734
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,890
Very great to meet you bros.
Prosper.

735
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,292
- Likewise.

736
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,060
- And if you brothers
change your mind, you know,

737
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,197
we got extra tents
and good vibes.

738
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,366
Ganja, goddesses.

739
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,268
I don't think we will.

740
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,637
- Yeah. Unlikely,
but thank you for the uh--

741
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,773
for the offer.

742
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,042
- Nice to meet you, dudes.

743
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:22,178
- Hmm-mm. Absolutely.

744
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,179
Yeah.
- Thank you.

745
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,747
Pleasure.

746
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,388
What?

747
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,194
- Ah, I don't know.

748
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,796
Don't you think a little
heads-up

749
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,598
would have been in order?

750
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,466
- No. Why?

751
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,001
I'm not his property.

752
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,607
I'm no one's and everyone's.

753
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,742
Through me.

754
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,512
- That doesn't mean anything.

755
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:59,649
- I just listen to my energy
and I follow it, Luke.

756
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,727
Don't do anything else.

757
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,530
Do you.

758
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,766
- I'll keep that in mind.

759
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,079
- Well...

760
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,749
Hmm.

761
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,417
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

762
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,720
I hope you find more
happy days,

763
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,891
old fashioned.

764
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,761
- Thank you.

765
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,897
- Go get her.

766
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,811
- Okay. Can we just
acknowledge something

767
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,246
for a second?

768
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,280
That was a great moment.

769
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,348
Whether or not
they're down there

770
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,953
with Johnny Dipshit
and the German sociopath.

771
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,624
You had fun,
I can see it on your face.

772
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,693
- I guess
I just thought we were

773
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,728
destined to run off
into the sunset or something.

774
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,731
Until Bodhi
from <i>Point Break</i> showed up.

775
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:27,737
- Ah, well, whatever.
We had fun.

776
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,739
- Yeah. Yeah.
I guess. Yeah.

777
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,710
- Ah, nothing should
surprise me anymore.

778
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,912
- Well...

779
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:38,881
I feel renewed.

780
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,551
- Do ya?

781
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:43,886
You look renewed.

782
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,956
- I invite you to join me
on this side of a good mood.

783
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,524
- Give me a minute,
I'll be right there.

784
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:53,129
How many necklaces
does that guy have on?

785
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,921
Hey.

786
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,723
Hey.

787
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,358
- Get up.
- What?

788
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,327
Got us a tee time.

789
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,962
Spanish Bay, baby.

790
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,633
- I hate golf.

791
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,470
- No, you don't.
Come on. Get up.

792
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,538
- I fuckin' suck at it.

793
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,639
- That's fine.
I'll beat you.

794
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,874
Be good for my ego.

795
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,210
Get up.

796
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:01,831
<i>Luke, it's your brother, Phil.</i>

797
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,332
<i>Give me a buzz</i>
<i>when you get a chance</i>

798
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,401
<i>to chat about the job</i>
<i>we talked about.</i>

799
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,637
<i>Good news is,</i>
<i>if you don't screw it up,</i>

800
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,172
<i>they'll probably</i>
<i>hire you on the spot.</i>

801
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:12,308
<i>Bad news is, the meeting</i>
<i>is now Monday morning.</i>

802
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,444
<i>I know it's last minute,</i>
<i>but you gotta figure out a way</i>

803
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:16,145
<i>to get on an airplane</i>
<i>and get out here.</i>

804
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,914
<i>Whatever the damage is,</i>
<i>we'll figure it out</i>

805
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,882
<i>between Dad and I</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

806
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,818
<i>Alright, man, give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>

807
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:25,855
- Who was that?

808
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,025
You really got to leave Monday?

809
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,695
For what? For the chance
to go sell trash in Richmond?

810
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:35,798
- I just-- I got to do this.

811
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,500
- You're meant
to go to Portland.

812
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:50,146
- Alright. You sink that putt,
I'll stay.

813
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,218
- Game on.

814
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:16,572
- Well... that's it, I guess.

815
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:25,982
<i>What's wrong?</i>

816
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,950
<i>What do you mean?</i>

817
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,519
<i>I can tell</i>
<i>by the tone of your voice</i>

818
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,220
<i>something's wrong.</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

819
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,391
<i>There's this guy</i>
<i>I'm working with.</i>

820
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,926
<i>Can't really talk specifics,</i>

821
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:41,097
<i>but I think he's makin'</i>
<i>a big mistake.</i>

822
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,765
<i>Can you get him</i>
<i>to change his mind?</i>

823
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,035
<i>I'm tryin',</i>
<i>but he's a stubborn one.</i>

824
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:48,538
<i>Well, you've been known</i>

825
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,807
<i>to have the power</i>
<i>of persuasion.</i>

826
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:54,143
<i>Yeah, well, we'll see.</i>

827
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,411
<i>I got to get goin'.</i>

828
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:58,347
<i>Kiss Lizzie for me,</i>
<i>and I love you.</i>

829
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,949
<i>Love you.</i>

830
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,317
<i>Bye.</i>

831
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,528
You really would have stayed

832
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,963
if I'd made that putt?

833
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:16,799
- You'll never know.

834
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,568
Oh, God.

835
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,739
- You know what
this night needs, Luke?

836
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,843
More company.

837
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,246
- Oh, come on, Wes.
It's our last night.

838
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,014
Let's just hang together.

839
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,584
- No.

840
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:36,719
Ladies, how's the wine?

841
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,021
- Not bad.
- Can't complain.

842
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,557
- Yeah? You-you visiting
from out of town?

843
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,025
- No, I live here in Carmel.

844
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,428
She's in town
visiting from Berkeley.

845
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,597
- Cool. I'm Wes.

846
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,931
- Rebecca.
- Ellen.

847
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,867
- Very good to meet you.
I don't mean to be a creep,

848
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,035
but do you see this scruffy guy,
over here?

849
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,036
Hmm-mm.

850
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,905
This guy
is a dear friend of mine,

851
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,674
and a troubled-- a troubled man,
and um, here's the deal.

852
00:47:58,676 --> 00:47:59,742
Here's what I think
we should do.

853
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:02,078
The four of us
should go to dinner.

854
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,047
Some good food,
some adult conversations.

855
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,183
A couple of drinks,
maybe several drinks.

856
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:10,486
Just take some time to remind
ourselves of life's joys

857
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:14,223
and in so doing, we can help
this poor Sad Sack over here

858
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,492
realize that he's making
the biggest mistake

859
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,094
of his entire life.

860
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,131
Please?

861
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,165
He's a grouch.
- Well, maybe

862
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,967
he's not as hopeless
as you say he is.

863
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:27,169
Maybe he's just searching
for something more.

864
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,772
- Maybe he hasn't found the one?
Maybe she's in Portland?

865
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,840
- Hmm.
- There we go.

866
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:33,376
- What does that even mean?
The one?

867
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,711
No, at-at this point in life,

868
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,648
I think it's more
a matter of practicality.

869
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,217
I've given up
on this notion that somehow,

870
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,387
I'll just run into someone
and know that she's the one.

871
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,822
And that's-- that's fine.
It's totally fine with me.

872
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,391
- Seems a little defeatist
to me.

873
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,026
- Agree.
- No, it's--

874
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:52,361
it's just not worth it anymore.

875
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,263
It's not.

876
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,632
- Dating to eventually
find the right one,

877
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,768
how is that not worth it?

878
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:07,610
- Okay, so take Ellen and I,
for example.

879
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:12,081
We could totally go back
to some hotel room

880
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:15,084
and um, sleep together.
- Hmm.

881
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:16,552
- Hmm.
- Mm.

882
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,821
But come morning,
either of us could wake up

883
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:22,224
feeling nothin' but--
but total emptiness.

884
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,427
And just really wanting to find
the quickest way out the door.

885
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:27,596
All for what?
A couple of hours of pleasure?

886
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,099
- Or we could end up dating.

887
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:33,302
And then, after a few months--

888
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,505
good months, where our feet
never touch the floor--

889
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,676
Maybe we don't want to invest
in this, you know?

890
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,511
How much do we want to
invest in this thing--

891
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,846
- Yeah.
- --That's taken time away

892
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:45,915
from meeting someone else?

893
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:48,851
Maybe I decide
that I wanna move on.

894
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,886
- Well--
- Only to realize of course

895
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:55,291
that, "Oh no,
that was really great."

896
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:58,027
- Or maybe I'm the one
agonizing--

897
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,395
--over my exit strategy

898
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,931
because I'm-- I'm somehow
riddled with all this guilt

899
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:06,002
over telling you that,
"I'm really sorry,

900
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:08,604
but this isn't
gonna happen after all."

901
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:12,108
- Oh!
So I'm left there wondering--

902
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,677
--did I mismanage my emotions

903
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,412
when I was with you?

904
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:17,480
If I had done this
or that differently--

905
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,181
- Agh!

906
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,716
Yes.
- --Would you have left me?!

907
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,852
- The pining
is the fucking worst!

908
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,488
It's true.

909
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,356
- It's pretty fucking awful.

910
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,357
- Yeah.

911
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:34,330
So why not just stick yourself
in a foxhole

912
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,831
with someone
we're comfortable with,

913
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:39,235
who cares for you,
fulfills all your daily needs--

914
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,169
- Hmm.

915
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:41,871
- --Even though
you're not entirely sure

916
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:43,472
that they're the one.

917
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,046
- Wow.

918
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,848
You two are clearly
meant to be together.

919
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,118
Best of luck to both of you--

920
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,887
- Thank you.
- --On that tragic journey.

921
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:01,323
Rebecca, how about you?

922
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:02,792
- Ha. Uh...

923
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:06,495
Well... it's complicated.

924
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:09,131
- Oh! Sure.

925
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,133
It's all complicated, right?

926
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:19,175
- To be honest... um...

927
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:22,378
This mornin',
I signed my divorce papers.

928
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,419
- Sorry to hear that.

929
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,189
- It's okay.

930
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,226
Actually...

931
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:42,398
it feels good to say it.

932
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,366
Yeah.

933
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:45,901
I'm divorced.

934
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,705
- There you go.

935
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,574
- Hmm.

936
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:53,676
- It's why I came down.

937
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:54,844
Just to give her some support

938
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:57,513
when she officially
closed the chapter.

939
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,150
Look at the sunset,
have a drink.

940
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,018
Think about a new chapter.

941
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,288
Come on.
To a new beginning.

942
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,166
- What about you, Wes?

943
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,202
- Uhm.

944
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,303
Well...

945
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:23,639
I'm married.

946
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,707
- Hmm.

947
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,475
- We have a baby girl.

948
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,577
She's-- actually,
she's almost two now.

949
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,680
- How long
have you been married?

950
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:33,349
- Uh, going on seven years.

951
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,653
Though, most days,
it feels like a little longer.

952
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:43,225
So, I hear ya.

953
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:46,362
Sharing your life
is complicated.

954
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,165
- Hmm.

955
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:55,971
- Let's get some air.

956
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,207
- Yeah.
- A little walk around Carmel?

957
00:52:58,209 --> 00:52:59,341
- Did I bring us down that much?

958
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,342
A little bit. Yeah.

959
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,144
- Where are you guys staying?

960
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,313
- We don't have a hotel yet.

961
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,382
- Oh well, then
you're staying with her.

962
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:08,951
- Oh, no. We'll find a place.
- Yeah, come on.

963
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,052
No, stay with us.

964
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,754
She's got a full bar.
Wine for days.

965
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:12,955
You gotta help this divorcee

966
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,123
who doesn't wanna
go to sleep yet.

967
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,591
- We're grown men,
we can handle ourselves.

968
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,592
- Ah-uh. You're staying.

969
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:20,262
- No, the two of you
should stay with us.

970
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,364
It's a-- it's fine.
Plenty of room.

971
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:25,534
Were you ever married?

972
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:30,072
- No. Almost. But no.

973
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:33,108
Almost?
What happened?

974
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,277
- He wanted kids.

975
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,479
- Wait? And you didn't?

976
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,547
- No.

977
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,615
- Wow.

978
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,485
- I'm sorry, are we in 1952?

979
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:44,920
And I need to put on--

980
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,922
- my little apron and do some
vacuuming around the house?

981
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,191
- I'm-I'm sorry.
I guess I just--

982
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,026
I guess I just have
this idea that deep down,

983
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:54,630
every woman wants to be a mother
and raise a family.

984
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,632
- No. Not me.

985
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:00,436
- How old are your kids?

986
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:03,138
- Jesse's 11,
and Caroline is nine.

987
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,080
- How often
do they see their dad?

988
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,149
- Every other weekend.

989
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,818
We share custody.

990
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,353
He's up in Palo Alto.

991
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,191
- How's that been?

992
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:27,062
- Um, you can't prepare
for this kind of stuff.

993
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:31,900
- Did I trade getting married
for living a life of my own?

994
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,269
Sure.

995
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:37,640
But... you know,
he's married now.

996
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:39,174
He has his kids.

997
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,178
I don't regret my path at all.

998
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,049
Definitely not boring,
I'll tell you that.

999
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:49,685
That's kind of the point.

1000
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,055
Isn't it?

1001
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,994
- All right,
big question for Luke.

1002
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,030
Tell me about this Maggie.

1003
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,132
What makes her so special?

1004
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,600
- The thing about Maggie--

1005
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:05,601
- Oh, yeah, no.

1006
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,602
I'm not allowed?

1007
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:09,405
- I want Luke to say it.

1008
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:15,110
Yeah, come on. Give a newly
divorced mom a little hope.

1009
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,415
- All right.

1010
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:21,717
Um...

1011
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:30,459
The first time I saw her
was English class.

1012
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:34,963
She was sitting by the window
as the sun was piercing in.

1013
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,566
You know, that classic
awe moment, right.

1014
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:45,341
But there was an innocence
about her that just struck me.

1015
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,243
And for whatever
mystical reason,

1016
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:51,680
from that moment on,
she was the girl I wanted.

1017
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:55,384
I remember I would
walk by her on campus

1018
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:57,319
or I'd see her
in the cafeteria,

1019
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,822
or at the library
or at a party.

1020
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:04,126
And, and the more this happened,
the more I began to create

1021
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:08,630
this romantic idea
of something with her.

1022
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:12,801
I started to dream
of us being together...

1023
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:15,371
without ever even saying

1024
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,539
much more than hello
to one another.

1025
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:23,579
But, the more I did this,
the harder it was

1026
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:26,782
to temper these really
intense feelings

1027
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,551
I had for this girl

1028
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,319
to a point where I could
actually connect with her

1029
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:31,587
like a human being,

1030
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,790
and not some angel
I had built her up to be.

1031
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,863
- But did you actually
connect with her?

1032
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,667
Uh-huh.

1033
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,838
The boat,
tell them about the boat.

1034
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,340
- Oh, a boat.
- What boat?

1035
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:52,708
- There's a boat.

1036
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:58,180
- My senior week,
right before graduation,

1037
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,716
my parents had this bay house
in Virginia.

1038
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:03,318
And I invited
all these people from school

1039
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,555
to drive out there
and crash for a few days.

1040
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,590
And somehow,
Maggie and her friends

1041
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,093
heard about it,
and surprisingly they showed up.

1042
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,428
- No, not surprisingly.

1043
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,062
They knew this was
Luke's last chance.

1044
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,397
Will you get to
the boat part, please?

1045
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:19,368
Alright, so, one afternoon,

1046
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,004
everyone was hanging out
by the pool,

1047
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,405
and she came up to me,

1048
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:28,310
and asked if I would
take her for a boat ride.

1049
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:34,349
I wanted every day
to feel like that boat ride.

1050
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:40,889
I remember we docked the boat
on this little man-made beach

1051
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,458
and we just sat there for hours

1052
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,361
and made up
for all the lost time.

1053
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,497
We talked about our future,
our dreams...

1054
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,934
and just what we
wanted out of life.

1055
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,871
And for those couple hours--

1056
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,643
she--

1057
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:05,948
she made me feel
all this... hope,

1058
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,683
like anything was possible.

1059
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:13,856
And then,
I know it sounds crazy,

1060
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:21,330
but all these dreams of love
and marriage flooded my mind.

1061
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:24,666
It was like
I could look across...

1062
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,971
at this girl I barely knew...

1063
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,276
and I could see my wife.

1064
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:44,019
- Now, ladies,
that is the guy I know.

1065
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,592
- But what happened between you?

1066
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,160
Anything?

1067
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:55,364
- Um, no.

1068
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:57,399
- What?

1069
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,535
- I had my chance, but...

1070
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:02,304
I was too afraid to ruin
this perfect moment.

1071
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:07,209
So that night,
she and her friends left.

1072
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,612
And graduation came.

1073
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,515
She moved to Europe,
and I never saw her again.

1074
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,253
- Didn't you go after her?
I mean, you loved her.

1075
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:20,489
Loved her?
No, I didn't love her.

1076
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:24,026
I mean, I was infatuated.

1077
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:27,329
I might have felt in love, but--

1078
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:29,464
- But-- See, but.

1079
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:34,269
Those-- those feelings,
that story you just told us,

1080
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,772
it's all part of being in love.

1081
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:40,742
- Those are just feelings,
it's not love.

1082
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,611
You two made it
perfectly clear tonight

1083
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:47,983
that love is not something you--
you create in your mind,

1084
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:50,686
it's not a fairytale.

1085
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,388
It's a-it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1086
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,456
- Well, hang on.

1087
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,757
- Oh, let me tell you
something, Luke.

1088
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,394
If you think it's all worth it
without the fairytale

1089
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:01,363
at least at some point
in the relationship,

1090
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:02,831
then you're wrong.

1091
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:07,569
Maybe me signing
those papers today

1092
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:11,173
is just more proof that
this whole idea of marriage

1093
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:14,910
is a myth.

1094
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:18,046
But the fairytale
that I had with that man

1095
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,048
in those first two years,

1096
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,619
that's the only reason
we made it through another 15.

1097
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:28,724
And... to tell you the truth,

1098
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,226
those moments
that you described,

1099
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,294
they still happen.

1100
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:36,932
They're just
tinier fragments of...

1101
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,735
a life that just becomes bigger
than the both of you.

1102
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:45,107
But it is those moments, Luke,
that ground you,

1103
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:47,376
that anchor you in life.

1104
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:49,478
And no matter
how far you sail away

1105
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,515
through all the pettiness,

1106
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,350
you need that stuff
to bring you back

1107
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:58,654
to the why of it all.

1108
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:05,427
To help you with the myth.

1109
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,564
Because without it,
there's nothing.

1110
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,067
Love is not
some form of practicality,

1111
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:13,502
and you know that.

1112
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:21,576
You should go.
You should go find her.

1113
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,278
I don't care how silly it is.

1114
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,183
Just open your heart back up
to the possibility of something.

1115
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,219
You do owe yourself that.

1116
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,524
- To Portland.

1117
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:37,292
- To Portland.

1118
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,760
It would be good for you.

1119
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:41,730
If it doesn't work out,

1120
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,465
you can always find me
in Berkeley.

1121
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,886
Are you sure
you want to give up all this?

1122
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,561
Because corporate America
is a far cry from this.

1123
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,962
You know that, right?

1124
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,019
- I know this isn't exactly

1125
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,888
what you had in mind,
but thank you.

1126
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:40,889
- Don't go.

1127
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,461
- Look Wes, I appreciate
everything you've done. And--

1128
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,830
I feel better, I really do.

1129
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,267
- Just stay, please.

1130
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,836
It's not just you
who needs this.

1131
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,978
- I have to do this, man.
I'm sorry.

1132
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,184
- Fine, well,
you're running late, so go.

1133
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,022
Go.

1134
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,966
Thank you for everything.

1135
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,294
<i>Hey.</i>

1136
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:53,628
<i>Hey, hon, how are you?</i>

1137
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,464
<i>Just walking</i>
<i>into this meeting now.</i>

1138
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,500
<i>I figured I'd give you</i>
<i>a quick ring.</i>

1139
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,101
<i>You ready?</i>

1140
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:01,136
<i>Um...</i>

1141
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,205
<i>Well, I actually</i>
<i>have some nerves.</i>

1142
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:05,774
<i>You nervous about a deal?</i>

1143
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:10,445
<i>It's a complicated one.</i>

1144
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:11,847
<i>I'm sure you'll do fine.</i>

1145
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,248
<i>People gravitate towards you.</i>

1146
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,084
<i>How's everything at home?</i>
<i>How's our girl?</i>

1147
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:18,920
<i>She's fine.</i>

1148
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:21,623
<i>She won't stop moving.</i>
<i>But that's nothing new.</i>

1149
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,358
<i>She got that from her mom.</i>

1150
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:25,694
<i>She certainly did.</i>

1151
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,264
<i>Let me know how it goes.</i>

1152
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,265
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

1153
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,869
<i>Love you.</i>

1154
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:35,036
<i>I love you, too.</i>

1155
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,663
- Thanks again.

1156
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:02,797
- Thank you very much.
- Yup.

1157
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,065
Thank you, guys.

1158
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,201
- We'll talk again.
- Wes, take care. Thank you.

1159
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,743
- Can I talk with you
in my office?

1160
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,085
Oh, I missed you.

1161
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,222
Oh my God, I'm so glad
it's the weekend.

1162
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,658
I have so many places
I want to show you.

1163
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,294
But first, I've got us
dinner reservations

1164
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:34,012
at this new spot.

1165
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,729
Uh, but then, there's
this amazing overlook

1166
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,766
I found near my apartment.
So we have to go do that.

1167
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,501
Uh, but there's also--

1168
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:43,104
- Okay, uh, just... slow down.

1169
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,241
- Wes, what's wrong?

1170
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:15,203
You're a coward.

1171
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,009
- Come on.

1172
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,313
You don't want to
start a life with a guy

1173
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,750
who would have
an ex-wife and a child.

1174
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,353
- I don't care about that.

1175
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:42,530
- I love you.

1176
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:50,071
I do, but I don't
want that for you.

1177
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,309
- Don't do that.

1178
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,779
Don't make this about me.

1179
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,051
I know what I want.

1180
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,990
I want you and you want me too,
so don't make this about me.

1181
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:17,165
Why can't you do this
for yourself?

1182
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,170
Why are you so afraid
to be happy?

1183
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:33,581
I don't know.

1184
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:48,189
I never want to see you again.

1185
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,095
I'll forget I ever knew you.

1186
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:29,390
Hey.

1187
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,227
<i>Hey, so it's 1:30 now.</i>

1188
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,028
<i>Sunset's not until 8:00.</i>

1189
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:37,065
<i>I figured we should be able to</i>
<i>make it to Leggett before nigh.</i>

1190
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,568
<i>Wes?</i>

1191
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,142
What are we doing?

1192
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:57,512
What's wrong, man?

1193
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,582
You haven't said a word
in like five hours.

1194
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:07,822
- Just work stuff.

1195
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,537
- Let's just call it a night
and double back to Fort Bragg.

1196
01:12:57,474 --> 01:12:59,741
- Kind of want to power through.

1197
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,745
Highway 1 ends in like 22 miles.

1198
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:06,814
- Yeah, 22 miles of dicey roads
in the middle of the woods.

1199
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,717
- Let's just keep going.

1200
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:13,388
- All right.

1201
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:24,332
Yeah, I bet it's the alternator.

1202
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,334
Why don't we get this thing
into town,

1203
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,803
and get it fixed up
first thing in the morning.

1204
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:29,971
I know a good shop.

1205
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:30,905
Where you guys headin'?

1206
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,307
- North.

1207
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:34,742
- What's the closest hotel
at this point?

1208
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,878
- The closest hotel,
all right, well...

1209
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,413
I know a funky little spot.

1210
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,317
- This place
is kind of spooky.

1211
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:46,087
- All right. Well--

1212
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,488
Sorry it's not the Chateau,
Mr. Hollywood,

1213
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,357
but it will have to do.

1214
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:52,260
- You've been carrying
all this cash around

1215
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:53,428
the whole time?

1216
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,697
- Yup. Been a cash-only
kind of trip.

1217
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:27,261
Another Glen?

1218
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:28,296
- Uh-huh.

1219
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:30,998
Let's do a double.

1220
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,343
- Two Moscow mules.

1221
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,350
Hello.

1222
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:52,386
- Hello.

1223
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:54,388
- How's your dinner?

1224
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,058
- Just what I needed.

1225
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,693
Been a long day.

1226
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,462
- You visiting?

1227
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:04,398
- Our car broke down, so we're
just-just staying the night.

1228
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,468
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

1229
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,571
- Well, it will be ready
in the morning, so--

1230
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,040
- I'm Charles.

1231
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:14,041
Hi.

1232
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,042
- Diedra.

1233
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:16,110
- Sage.

1234
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:17,979
- Sage, Diedra.

1235
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:19,947
Here, let me get those.

1236
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,284
Yup.

1237
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,222
- Thank you.

1238
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,358
- Oh, sorry, this is
my business partner...

1239
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,561
Gary.

1240
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:34,695
- Gary.

1241
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,499
What kind of business?

1242
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,301
- Uh, oil business.

1243
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:42,904
Yeah, we are up...

1244
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,473
we're up here searching
for some new prospects.

1245
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:47,475
- You drilling?

1246
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:52,880
- Sorry.

1247
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:53,748
- We are drilling.

1248
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,783
Uh-hmm.

1249
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:56,784
Why don't you
join us for a drink

1250
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:59,020
when you're done
with your dinner.

1251
01:15:59,022 --> 01:15:59,954
You too, Gary.

1252
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:09,864
- Are you for real? Again?

1253
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,402
You're un-fucking-believable,
man.

1254
01:16:16,306 --> 01:16:17,505
Our car's going to be ready
in the morning.

1255
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,373
Can we just sleep?

1256
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:24,378
- No one is forcing you
to stay out late.

1257
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,314
- Come on, Wes,
I'm here now for the endgame.

1258
01:16:26,316 --> 01:16:27,615
You've got me, I'm in.

1259
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,718
We don't need any more detours.

1260
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,853
- Yeah, you don't need
any more detours.

1261
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:35,856
I--

1262
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:40,795
Just be quiet and let me do
what I'm going to do.

1263
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:48,369
- That's not even a detour,

1264
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,638
it's just--
it's just a wrong turn.

1265
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:54,241
- Fine.

1266
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,409
Go to bed.

1267
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:01,115
- Gary thinks you're an asshole.

1268
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:00,074
How much do you love fucking?

1269
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,811
Don't you love fucking,
Charlie?

1270
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,114
I love fucking.

1271
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:12,253
I'll take sex any moment,
anytime.

1272
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:13,788
I don't know if it's my DNA,

1273
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,757
or something from my daddy's
homemade porn videos.

1274
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:18,693
It was?

1275
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,162
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1276
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:24,899
My daddy is fucked up.

1277
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:30,471
When I was 12, I found this
old VHS tape in his bedroom.

1278
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,973
Of course I was curious.

1279
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:33,941
And I watched it.

1280
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:40,881
And I saw my stepmom
in this old lit dark saloon,

1281
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:44,618
getting fucked by a bunch of men
in gorilla masks.

1282
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,687
Guess who was behind the camera?

1283
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:51,325
Daddy.

1284
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:52,893
Uh-huh.

1285
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,495
There you go.

1286
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:59,834
That is enough
daddy porn video talk.

1287
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,204
Let's make our own video.

1288
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:04,538
- Yeah.

1289
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,140
- You want to make a video,
Charlie?

1290
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:10,511
Come on, you have
too much clothes on.

1291
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,480
- Alright.

1292
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:17,051
- I'm going to do this
all for the video.

1293
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,186
Where's your phone?

1294
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:22,957
- Yes.
- Wait a sec.

1295
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,228
- Umm, look at the oilman's ass.

1296
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,429
That's a fucked-up story.

1297
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,466
Are we going to make it
to Portland?

1298
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:14,568
- You should be okay, but...

1299
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,203
I'd get a proper check
once there.

1300
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:19,840
My wife will get you
squared away.

1301
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:22,142
- Oh, yeah,
I'll have your bill in a sec.

1302
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:24,612
- Hey, babe, you good?

1303
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:26,614
- Yeah.
- That was the--

1304
01:21:26,616 --> 01:21:27,982
- Alternator.
- Yes.

1305
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:30,584
- And the check of the filter.
- Yes, that's right.

1306
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:31,952
Okay. Love you.

1307
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:35,923
Um, I'll put the key
in the-in the Bronco.

1308
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:38,959
- Thanks.
- Hey, Rex, I'll follow you out.

1309
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,160
I've got a quick question.

1310
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,964
<i>So, uh, if I turn my fan on--</i>

1311
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:52,373
- How long has it been?

1312
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:54,375
- Hmm?

1313
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:02,816
Aww! 51 years.

1314
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:05,419
- Wow! What's the secret?

1315
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:13,761
Oh!
There's been a lot of...

1316
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,763
life since that photo.

1317
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,866
A lot of change.

1318
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,736
But with all that change...

1319
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:29,110
I guess it's about

1320
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,912
always working to find
each other in the end.

1321
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:36,850
- That's beautiful.

1322
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:39,086
- Thank you.

1323
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,691
- All right.
What's the damage?

1324
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:44,892
What do I owe ya?

1325
01:22:44,894 --> 01:22:46,427
- It's not too bad.

1326
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,296
There you go.

1327
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,966
- Great.

1328
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:10,050
Fuck! Fuck!

1329
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:12,286
- Are you okay?
- Ah, yeah. Sorry.

1330
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:14,555
Um, I, I've got some money
in the car.

1331
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:15,622
I'll be back.

1332
01:23:33,743 --> 01:23:35,442
- I might finally
have some reception.

1333
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,946
Sarah called me.

1334
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:43,150
Why's your wife
calling me, Wes?

1335
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:46,186
She left me a message.

1336
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,821
- Do, do not listen
to that voicemail.

1337
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:50,190
- Oh, wait! She left me
four fucking messages.

1338
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:53,627
Why, why do I have four fucking
messages from your wife, Wes?

1339
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:54,661
- You know,
just give me the phone!

1340
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:55,763
- No!

1341
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,031
- Just give me
the fucking phone!

1342
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:57,731
Give me the phone.
- Why? They're clearly for me.

1343
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:59,066
- Give me the goddamn phone!

1344
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:04,938
- What happened
in San Francisco, Wes?

1345
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,575
You've been fucking dark
ever since.

1346
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:09,576
Somethin' happened.

1347
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:13,814
The man with all the answers.

1348
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:15,849
And the one time
I actually ask for one,

1349
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,618
you won't give it to me.

1350
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,053
Just be honest!

1351
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,190
- I was having
a fucking affair!

1352
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:27,294
Okay?

1353
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,698
I fell in love
with a woman from work.

1354
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,933
Are you happy now?

1355
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:38,172
But I ended it.

1356
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:39,173
I ended it.

1357
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:42,076
Because no matter
how much I love her,

1358
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,911
I don't want to ruin my family.

1359
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:48,649
But I did not sleep
with those women last night.

1360
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:49,983
They robbed me, okay?

1361
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:51,018
That's why
I'm freaking out right now.

1362
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,820
They took my credit cards,
my AMEX cards,

1363
01:24:52,822 --> 01:24:54,988
and Sarah has access
to my AMEX cards,

1364
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,623
and I'm sure she's seen
the fraud charges

1365
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:58,025
and knows something's up.

1366
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:05,999
You're right.

1367
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:11,905
I'm supposed to have
all the answers.

1368
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:13,607
You're the one guy
that knows I don't.

1369
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,953
- Why didn't you tell me
about it before?

1370
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,488
- You wouldn't
answer the phone.

1371
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:22,376
<i>Wes, where are you?</i>

1372
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:25,412
<i>The hotel in San Francisco</i>
<i>says you never checked in.</i>

1373
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,748
<i>There's all these strange</i>
<i>charges on the credit card.</i>

1374
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,882
<i>I don't know where you are,</i>

1375
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,050
I don't know what's going on,

1376
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:32,686
I,
you don't answer your phone.

1377
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,797
<i>I don't care what's going on.</i>

1378
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:46,066
I just need you to call me
and let me know you're okay

1379
01:26:46,068 --> 01:26:47,701
'cause I'm kind of
freaking out here.

1380
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,647
<i>Call me please, okay?</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

1381
01:27:53,202 --> 01:27:55,335
- Eventually, our boss
got wind of the affair.

1382
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,106
And he couldn't allow things
to move forward

1383
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:00,474
the way they were going.

1384
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:03,910
But he needed us both.

1385
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:05,279
Thank God.

1386
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:10,517
So he had Jennifer take over
the San Francisco office...

1387
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:15,522
Left me in D.C.

1388
01:28:15,524 --> 01:28:16,690
And um...

1389
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,463
for the past year,
I've been living a double life

1390
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,132
with a woman
across the country.

1391
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:33,607
- I should have
picked up the phone.

1392
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,275
- No, man, it's okay.

1393
01:28:35,277 --> 01:28:36,843
- No, no. I should've.

1394
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:39,379
I should have been
there for you.

1395
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:43,817
I'm sorry.

1396
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:47,688
- You're here now.

1397
01:28:56,965 --> 01:28:59,299
Jeez.

1398
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,702
I don't know
what I'm doing. Fuck.

1399
01:29:04,473 --> 01:29:05,706
I don't know.

1400
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,480
- Wes, look, man.

1401
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:18,752
I don't have
a clue about marriage.

1402
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:19,753
I don't know what it's like.

1403
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:20,821
I'm just some single dude

1404
01:29:20,823 --> 01:29:25,158
who's spent the majority
of his adult life alone.

1405
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,262
So, who am I to give you
advice, right?

1406
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,869
But what the fuck!

1407
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,169
You can't lie your way
through the rest of your life.

1408
01:29:37,172 --> 01:29:38,372
What's the point?

1409
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:43,043
You're just
going to hurt people,

1410
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,544
people important to you.

1411
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,717
So just...

1412
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,319
just make a choice.

1413
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:54,855
And stick with it.

1414
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,463
<i>We are reading to begin</i>

1415
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:05,932
<i>security screening for Flight</i>
<i>310 with service to Sacramento.</i>

1416
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:08,001
<i>At this time, if you'd gather</i>
<i>your personal items</i>

1417
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:10,504
<i>and have your boarding pass</i>
<i>and your photo ID out</i>

1418
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:12,873
<i>and available for myself</i>
<i>and the TSA agents</i>

1419
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,474
<i>when you get to the checkpoint.</i>

1420
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,348
- It was fun, buddy.

1421
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,421
- What am I supposed to do
with the Bronco?

1422
01:30:30,692 --> 01:30:31,825
- Keep it.

1423
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:34,194
Come here.

1424
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:37,330
And I don't need to tell you
what to do with it.

1425
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,300
You're ten miles from Oregon.

1426
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:42,502
Come on, Wes.

1427
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:45,839
- That Maggie thing is real.

1428
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:47,407
She asked about you.

1429
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,748
Look...

1430
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:58,351
you're right.

1431
01:30:58,353 --> 01:31:00,887
I had to lie to get
a little freedom for myself

1432
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:04,257
and, I hurt some people.

1433
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,493
But...

1434
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:09,996
You don't have to lie.

1435
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:12,532
And...

1436
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:14,634
right now,
you're only hurting yourself.

1437
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,143
- Get on the plane.

1438
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,444
Go on.

1439
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,858
- You know what to do
with that Bronco.

1440
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:07,387
<i>Luke, it's Phil again.</i>

1441
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:08,855
<i>Give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>

1442
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,290
<i>Second voicemail.</i>

1443
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,125
<i>I don't know where you are,</i>
<i>I don't know what's going on,</i>

1444
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:13,426
<i>and I don't know</i>
<i>what you're doing,</i>

1445
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:15,729
<i>but you gotta get on</i>
<i>that airplane, man.</i>

1446
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:17,697
<i>Remember, I put myself</i>
<i>out there for this</i>

1447
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:18,798
so don't screw me over.

1448
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:35,568
- Hey, buddy!

1449
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,103
Want to make a quick 20 bucks?
