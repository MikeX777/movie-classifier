00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,063
Me and Beat grew up on
the shores of San Pedro.

3
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,857
lt's a harbor town
south of Los Angeles,

4
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,277
populated with
the families of hard
working blue-collar men

5
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,905
who live and die by
the codes of the Union

6
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,532
and the bosses who
controlled the ports.

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,371
My dad was one
of those men.

8
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,165
l always imagined
that l would some
day be one, too.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,714
Beat got his name
from the kids at school
who pushed him around.

10
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,593
So l started
pushing back.

11
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,931
But no one pushed him harder
than his father when he came
home from the bars at night.

12
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,688
We'd smoke the cigarettes
l'd stolen from my dad.

13
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,190
Talk about the days
in front of us.

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,192
Places that we'd go.

15
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,528
Ships we'd sail.

16
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,863
And ports with girls.

17
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,867
That thing was crazy.

18
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,920
Look at this.

19
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,862
Hello?

20
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,113
Hi, Rose, it's me.

21
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,157
ls everything okay?

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,243
No, everything
is not okay. Have
you heard from her?

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,037
No.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,330
Rose, it's been two weeks
What the fuck's going on?

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,665
What did you
do, Liam?

26
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,167
I didn't do anything .

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,710
Something
must've happened.

28
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,253
I swear to God ,
I didn't do anything.

29
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,672
You must've
said something.

30
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,885
I didn't say anything .
I thought we were doing fine.
And then she just, I mean

31
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:01,097
I-I know you and Chance
wiII be fine without me.

32
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,933
What am l supposed
to tell Chance?

33
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,394
Just tell him that
you went to San Diego.

34
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,106
lf she does, could you
ask her to call me
at least?

35
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,859
You know l will.

36
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,652
You take it
easy, Liam .

37
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,196
Thanks, Rose.
I appreciate it.

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,864
Call me if
you hear anything.

39
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,948
Yeah , aII right.

40
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,494
Bye.

41
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,754
Actually, you
know, it was

42
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,547
Hey. Where have
you guys been?

43
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,925
We were at the beach.

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,261
You better be carefuI . You're
gonna kiII yourseIves Iike

45
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,889
There you go.

00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,599
Give me a coupIe.

47
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,060
Left. AII right,
aII right.

48
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,895
Beat. Beat.

49
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,855
Can we see
the new move?

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,566
Okay, okay. Good.
Let's get something
to eat. Come on.

51
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,443
Ouch.

52
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,029
Hey.

53
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,198
Dad, he hit a rock
when he jumped in
the water.

54
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,574
PIease, don't
hurt my dad.

55
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,992
Are you sore
back here?

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,619
No, it's okay.

57
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,708
Son of a bitch.

58
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,627
Dad! Dad!

59
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,088
You boys stay
right there.

60
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,555
Come here. I'II get you.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,050
Why the fuck have
you kiIIed him?

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,764
I need some heIp!
I need some heIp!

63
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,141
He'II never
hurt you again.

64
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,310
Fucking get away
from my son.

65
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,647
You're fucking done.
You'II fucking pay for
this. I swear to God !

66
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,814
Get up. Get up. Get up.

67
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,830
Somebody cIean up
this garbage.

68
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,546
That's Bookman .
He took me under
his wing.

69
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,633
He kept me out of
the shit details while
he trained me to fight.

70
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,593
When l was ready,
he set up the fights

71
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,013
that he and the guards
ran in the boiler room.

72
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,767
My dad taught me
to box, but Bookman
taught me to fight.

73
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,561
He was the closest
thing to a friend
that l had.

74
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,647
Fucking off somewhere.

75
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,567
Davis!

76
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,259
AW.

77
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,516
Saving Bookman
cost me eight stitches,

78
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,269
but it bought me
five years.

79
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,148
ln a couple of months,
finally l get to go home.

80
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,341
Saying goodbye was
harder than l thought.

81
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,301
He said we'd
stay in touch.

82
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,887
But l think we both
knew we wouldn't.

83
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,331
Sue?

84
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,791
Are you aII right?

85
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,337
I'II be right there.
Don't move.

86
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,339
Ha-ha. Like you can.

87
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,679
Okay, roII over.

88
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,847
Jesus, Mary
and Saint.

89
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,849
Use your arm !
Push , push !

90
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,768
Let's just stay

91
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,228
God !

92
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,189
I'm sorry, Rose.

93
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,067
Aw, Jesus!
Where's your stuff?

94
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,861
Right below you .
Thank you.

95
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,077
Sue. If you wanna go
on kiIIing yourseIf,
that's fine.

96
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,287
WouId you stop
incIuding me?

97
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,626
Do you think Chance,
he'II stay here with you?

98
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,213
No.

99
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,967
Chance aIways has
some pIace to stay.

100
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,511
It's just the wrong
pIace, that's aII.

101
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,139
Sounds Iike most of
the men I've known.

102
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,057
I'm making you somethin'.

103
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,976
Oh.

104
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,269
What coIor is it?

105
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,812
Green . You'II Iove it.

106
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,157
Why don't you move
your fucking bike?

107
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,950
Why don't you come
over here and make me?

108
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,077
Fuck you.

109
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,286
Hey, fuck you.

110
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,205
No, fuck you.

00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,457
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
Fuck you !

112
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,459
No, fuck you .

113
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,044
Piece of shit.

114
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh, my God.
Ready for a rematch?

115
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,634
Yeah, I can give you
a fucking head start.

116
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,761
Is the pier
okay with you?

117
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,805
How does it feeI
to have something
big between your Iegs, huh?

118
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,181
Why don't you
Iick me?

119
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,252
Are you good?

120
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,380
My fucking shrink's
got me on a new
one now.

121
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,507
Gravi-siI.

122
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,801
Ugh.

123
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,471
So, what do you wanna
do first, man?

124
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,849
I gotta go
see Kat.

125
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,351
See where I stand .
Have you seen her?

126
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,812
She hasn't been around much
since you've been gone.

127
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,814
Where is she staying?

128
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,609
Down by the docks.
Eddie put'em up.
One of his pIaces.

129
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,777
Them?

130
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,738
I mean her.

131
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,952
Hey.

132
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,080
I missed you
so much .

133
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,542
I missed you, too.

134
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,628
HaiI HitIer.

135
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,508
I toId you not
to say that shit.

136
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,056
What's the word
on my son?

137
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,810
He's out. He was
reIeased this morning.

138
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,233
I don't wanna be
out of Iine.

139
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,152
Some of the men think
it might be a good idea
to Iean on him.

140
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:26,866
Look. I mean, he did
stop a head on the
marked nigger.

141
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:32,455
If anyone in the brim
taIks or even thinks of
putting hurt on my bIood,

142
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,543
you are going
to teII me. Hm?
Correct?

143
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,336
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

144
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,596
Go change your pants.

145
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,141
You're a fucking disgrace.

146
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,656
Who the fuck are you?

147
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,159
Who is it?

148
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,998
Hey, Kat.

149
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,062
August, this
is your daddy.

150
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,773
He's been away
for a Iong time
and now he's back.

151
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,026
That's funny, Kat.
Whose kid is it?

152
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,946
Look, I didn't wanna
teII you when you were
on the inside, okay?

153
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,453
Uh, look, l'm gonna
go get a drink
or two

154
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,373
And why don't you get
to know your kid? I'II

155
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,167
Don't you wanna
catch up?

156
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,835
Kat, come on.

157
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,421
You can't just Ieave
me with this kid.

158
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,840
Whose kid is it?

159
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,845
Oh, Jesus.

160
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,858
l only wanna do this
if they throw down .

161
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,111
Hard and bIoody, huh?

162
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,863
WeII the Lt say they're
gonna bust him and bring
him for questioning?

163
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,408
WeII, Lts have a
tendency to forget.

164
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,744
Every once in a whiIe
in the fieId, things
don't go that smoothIy.

165
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,788
I wanna make
sure things are
gonna be cooI.

166
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,667
Benny, Benny, what you
have to make sure of
in your heart

167
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,170
is that you trust me,
okay? That you trust us.
You're the new kid here.

168
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:49,467
All right? So let's
get that straight. You
have to trust me. Okay?

169
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,927
AII right.

170
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,178
Okay?

171
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,141
Okay.

172
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,184
Who's throwing
the switch?

00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,177
You?

338
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,638
One of Eddie's
girIs? No.

339
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:45,016
No, I meant, are
you friends with him?

340
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,686
Not exactIy. You?

341
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,854
Not exactIy.

342
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,278
I shouId go.

343
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,407
I'II see you
guys around.

344
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,076
FeeI free to go.
You don't have
to rush off.

345
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,787
I-I shouId.
Thanks for the soda.

346
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,288
Yeah.

347
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,915
God bIess you !

348
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,459
Okay, bye. Thanks.

349
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,755
Wow.

350
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,681
Hey, what's up?

351
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,057
Hey, Sonny.

352
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,308
M ind if I come in?

353
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,768
Yeah, come on in.

354
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,520
How are you
doin', brother?

355
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:34,149
AII right. You
got some business?

356
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,192
Just a coupIe
of things.

357
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,696
Contract got pIayed ,
so that's one Iess
name in the hat.

358
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,198
And, uh, your
boy, he's gone.

359
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:45,952
Yeah , that was oId
business. Not my caII .
What eIse do you got?

360
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,499
Listen, man, I've been
giving this a Iot of
thought, aII right?

361
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,668
Your son.

362
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:57,380
If we give him
controI over San Pedro,

363
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,632
and with his network,

364
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,927
aII the probIem
I foresee is,

365
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,848
we can keep in the product
store to keep up with the
demand. What do you think?

366
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,933
No.

367
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:15,732
You know, I wouId think
that you wouId want your
son to have a post

368
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,068
as opposed to being
in an earIy grave.

369
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,862
No one goes
near my son.

370
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,449
End of story.

371
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,494
Listen. You know,
when I go through
out there,

372
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,579
taking out my ass
here for you,

373
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,290
it's Iike covering
for your ass, okay?

374
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,626
You're making us aII
Iook fucking bad.

375
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,547
Making who
Iook bad?

376
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,383
Hm?

377
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,396
We got a probIem
here, Sonny?

378
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:01,528
No, I ain't got no
probIem . You're
the boss.

379
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,405
I ain't got no
probIem.

380
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,070
It's been so Iong
I don't even know
how to say hey.

381
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:47,115
Hey, I got some Iunch
for us. Let's go grab
something to eat.

382
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,742
I'm Iate for
an appointment.

383
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:55,749
That appointment
you got with Ted,

384
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,751
that's been canceIed.

385
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,919
See, I had Ted
take you off
the computer,

386
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,422
so now you don't have
to check in with Ted.

387
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:05,425
You have to
check in with me.

388
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,969
Consider this your
first check-in.

389
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,100
Get in the fucking car.

390
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,028
Man, you Iook good.

391
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:30,116
That port over there,
that's where l get a
lot of my stuff

392
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,786
coming from the last
five years. l kinda
own this place.

393
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:36,664
l don't have
to pay for parking.

394
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:40,377
So, I heard you won some
pretty big fights inside.
StiII fighting dirty?

395
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,421
I shouId ask you
the same question.

396
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,466
Listen , I got
merchandise, man.

397
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,886
I-I don't wanna know.
I'm not interested.

398
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,681
Chance, you gotta
start over, man.

399
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,142
I mean , you gotta
have money. You got-
you got a boy to feed.

400
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,645
How the fuck do you
know I have a kid?

401
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,440
How about your daddy,
you taIk to him?

402
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,609
Why?

403
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,736
Why? He just became
one of the heads of
the Aryans, that's why.

404
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,947
So?

405
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,282
So? He's under tremendous
pressure to bring you
into the foId.

406
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,410
And why fuck
wouId I care?

407
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,787
Because I have a deaI
pending with the Aryans

408
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,456
and it might heIp
soIve the situation.

409
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,419
Because Iet me teII you,
if the Aryans Iose controI
of the prison drug trade,

410
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:26,548
your dad's reign of the top
is gonna be one of the
shortest in history.

411
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,926
I'II show you something.

412
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,595
Come on.

413
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,557
Leshaun. Hey, man,
this is Chance.

414
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,726
Chance, Leshaun .
Leshaun, Chance.

415
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,936
That's fucked up.

416
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,356
Leshaun here and the BIoods
were trying to hoard in
the Aryans turf.

417
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,608
Bookman was their
Iiaison inside.

418
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,570
It was brave shit
of you , man , jumping
for him Iike that.

419
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,321
He's my friend.

420
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,449
I'm your friend.

421
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:55,535
Friends don't Iet friends
do five fucking years.

422
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,331
Are you bIaming me
for you getting set up?

423
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,792
Is that what aII this
fucking attitude is about?

424
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,503
I had to deaI with the DA.
Beat was supposed to go
down , not you .

425
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,630
You didn't have to put
yourseIf under the bus.

426
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,383
It's your buIIshit sense
of IoyaIty that Iocked
you up, not me.

427
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,302
You taIk to me about
fucking IoyaIty?

428
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,846
Beat was steaIing
from me. From us.

429
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,306
Beat wanted
what he deserved.

430
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,682
What was that?

431
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:18,808
More.

432
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,560
WeII, I got more.

433
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:23,938
I got 25 keys.
We gotta move
them right away.

434
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,900
It's a big one, Chance.
We can retire on this

435
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,152
and we can fucking go
to the South Pacific.

436
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:32,822
We can spend the rest
of our Iives tanning and
eating fucking mangoes.

437
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,492
Took five Iong years
to think about you
aIright.

438
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:38,119
Five very Iong
fucking years.

439
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,081
Chance, Iet me
drive you back.

440
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,707
I'II waIk.

441
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,793
Chance!

442
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,672
Fuck.

443
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,177
Fine fucking cop
and San Pedro's.

444
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:07,107
l heard about
your new post.
Mazel tov.

445
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,319
I'm here
about your son.

446
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:15,365
And considering
your new post and my
reIationship with Chance.

447
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,242
Your reIationship?

448
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:21,621
Yea, we're,
um . . .cIose.

449
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm offering you
the opportunity

450
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,127
to heIp Chance
start over,

451
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,379
and to fIex your
new muscIes, huh?

452
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:33,091
I got a Iot of product
that I gotta move right
away. About 25 kiIos.

453
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:37,846
That's interesting .
The word is 25 keys just
got ripped from the BIoods.

454
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,224
ReaIIy? WeII , I don't
do business with niggers.

455
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,019
Like it showed up
on your doorstep.

456
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:48,314
Liam, you don't want the Aryans
to find out that you passed on
this deaI. It's bad business.

457
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,985
Fucking son
of a bitch.

458
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,322
AII right, have it
your way, asshoIe.

459
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,327
That guard Chance saved
was marked to go down.

460
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,499
By who?

461
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,294
ABs in Riverside.

462
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,464
Bookman was up and
moved dope for the
BIoods in Long Park.

463
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,966
And your point?

464
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,093
My point is,

465
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,512
you fuck with Chance,

466
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,807
I drop a photo of you
for circuIation . Your
name goes in the hat.

467
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,435
You think you're fucking
bulletproof in here, huh?

468
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,521
I can have you shipped
and stripped in about
six fucking minutes,

469
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:32,025
and somewhere where the
Aryans don't have as much
suck as they got here.

470
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,234
Fuck you.

471
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,861
Fuck you!

472
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:39,574
Liam,

473
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:45,705
I'm just trying
to teII you that if you
wanna keep your new post,

474
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,792
you gotta consider
doing business with me.

475
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,294
Huh? Huh?

476
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,548
You wanna stay aIive?

477
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:01,054
You better Iook every
each way before you
cross me.

478
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:09,187
Okay.

I haven't

499
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,896

No, it's good .
How about I take
you to dinner?

506
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:54,209
l don't think that's a
good idea. Plus, who's
gonna watch August?

507
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,337
WeII.

508
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,588
Are you kidding?

509
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,590

00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:11,267
I'II think about it.

514
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,144
You're gonna
think about it?

515
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,854
Yeah.

516
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:18,900
How is it going?

517
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,276
Good.

518
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,528
WeII.

519
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:22,821
Look at me.

520
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,239
She's not coming back.

521
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,408
Are you gonna go
see your dad?

522
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,119
Why do you bring up
the heavy shit, huh?

523
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:30,912
Are you gonna go
see your daddy?

524
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:35,667
I don't--I-I-
I don't know.
I don't know.

525
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,461
I saw him.

526
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:39,713
You saw him . When?

527
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,673
I saw him.

528
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,133
When did you
go see him?

529
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:45,093
Last year.
The fucking shrink

530
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,846
thought it wouId be
a good idea to stop
the nightmares.

531
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,431
Chance?

532
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,683
He doesn't Iike me.

533
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,022
Did you mean it?

534
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,690
Mean it?

535
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:01,568
Did you mean
to kill him?

536
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,117
I wanted him
to stop hurting you.

537
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,661
I was so scared of him.

538
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,585
You know your father
was a very sick man.

539
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:24,758
I aIso know that you
were nothing Iike him.

540
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,013
You are nothing
Iike him.

541
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,267
You're good.

542
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,561
I don't feeI
that way.

543
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,939
Come here.

544
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:51,618
You are more of a dad

581
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,392
I don't think

00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,894

Hey, Chance.

00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,561
Hey, Sue. Sorry
about the company

617
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,188
It wouIdn't be so bad if
she'd just hop in bed
every once in a whiIe.

618
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,232
She's reaIIy

Anyway, wait. I've

They're just dangerous

Sit down.

00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,501
Don't faII . I don't

I don't know what I'm
gonna do with him though.

645
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,859
Fucking messy nigger.

646
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:43,238
You want a foot?

647
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:49,244
I think we're out
of Leshaun . There's
no more Leshaun.

648
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:00,588
Hi , Rose.

649
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,049
Hey, Ken .

Is he sIeeping?

651
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:11,516
Yeah , he's crashed
up on the couch.

652
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,268
You want a smoke?

653
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,900
Smoke.

654
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:31,745
Have you taIked
to your father?

655
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,291
No.

656
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:40,211
You know, he actuaIIy
wrote me a coupIe of
times through the years.

657
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:43,506
Yeah , well, l don't really
give a shit about him.

658
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:46,301
Yes, you do.

659
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:52,015
When you're through trying to
convince yourself that you're
never gonna be him , well.

660
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,186
Those mistakes that
he made and continues
to make, he's gotta survive.

661
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:00,857
Those mistakes as
you caII 'em , fucked
aII our Iives up.

662
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,945
What wouId you have done
in his shoes?
Don't answer me.

663
00:49:05,987 --> 00:49:08,406
Just think about it.

664
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,993
Have you heard
from your mother?

665
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:15,413
No. Not in a Iong time.

666
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:20,335
She's just Iike Kat.
A whore who ran away.
Besides, you're my mom.

667
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:25,298
Don't you taIk
that way about her.

668
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:28,635
She's your mother,
and more importantIy
that she's my sister.

669
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:36,267
What is it? What-what
makes you think you're so
much better than everybody?

670
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:38,436
I know.

671
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,231
I know what you do,
mister drug boy.

672
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:49,280
You gotta go see him.

673
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,787
WouId you mind watching

676
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,477
You take aII

Ready to open a jump? Don't

680
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:43,668
And remember the ruIes.
The ruIes are, there

Hit it.

Serious money? You're gonna
pick up a fight on the Wall
Street Journal.

686
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:25,687
There's no serious money.
That gIobe's in a shit.
Everybody wants the big dig.

687
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:30,108
No wanna lickety split.
Real match is gonna take
40 days and 40 nights.

688
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:33,695
MeanwhiIe, I need my scratch

So come manana.

Ioot and scoot.

00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,909
Somebody's gonna get
their young ass scaIed ,
and it ain't gonna be mine

691
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:43,371
'cause my ass

692
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,790
No.

693
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:49,002
No? Is that
the existentiaI no,

694
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,671
or does that refer to
something specificaIIy
I just said?

695
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:54,007
I'm fucking done.

696
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:57,344
Done?

697

I gave you a home.
I gave you the Iife.

699
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,396
You were happy with
the scratch we made.

700
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,399
But you wanted the flash
and dash . You wanted
the razzle dazzle,

701
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:13,735
some twisted
punk DEA agent,

702
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:16,988
and you get five
long hard time.

703
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:20,200
And while your absolutely
certifiable girlfriend

704
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:23,078
with that stupid gash
is trying to find herseIf,

705
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:26,039
who the fuck was taking
care of your face? Huh?

706
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:30,627
Who's taking care of your
son? Let me give you the
facts of life here, brother.

707
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,631
You show up and
you pay up. Dig it.

708
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:37,300
Okay. Eddie,
it's no probIem.

709
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,636
WouId you shut
the fuck up? What
do you mean no probIem?

710
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,931
No probIem .
That's a sentence.

711
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:45,016
That's where
a period goes.

712
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,977
Report from Beijing
is on the phone.

713
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,399
Every fucking night?

714
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:46,745
TaIk to Eddie,
you fuck.

715
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:53,335
The guards fucking
rained down on me.

716
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,420
Are you fucking crazy?

717
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:01,217
lt's gonna be smooth
with this run . l'm
telling you.

718
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:06,014
Eddie is up
our asses. Okay?

719
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:09,476
AII that we have to do
is make a few caIIs
to the oId gang,

720
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,229
and you and I we can
move this IittIe brother
in no time.

721
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,857
Where did you get it?

722
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,817
Beat, where the fuck
did you get this?

723
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:21,029
The Iess you know,
the better. AII right?

724
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:23,323
Listen to me.

725
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,495
This gives me a way
to make up to you for,
for the Iast time, you know.

726
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:32,749
You didn't, you didn't
roII on me and I owe you

727
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:36,336
fucking forever
for that, okay?

728
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,256
Do you know
the definition
of insanity?

729
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,301
Dude, that is a stupid
question to post
in me, man.

730
00:55:43,426 --> 00:55:47,013
lt's doing the same thing over
and over again expecting
different results.

731
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:48,515
Who said that?

732
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:50,016
My oId man.

733
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:22,382

742
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:04,758
I thought I toId you

00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:17,854
You stay away from him .
He's not gonna last.

746
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,198
So, I got a kid now.

747
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:30,867
His name's August.

748
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:34,329
How oId is he?

749
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:38,375
Five.

750
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:42,337
Sometimes he fucking
Iooks at me. I don't know
what the fuck he wants.

751
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,382
That sounds famiIiar.

752
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,387
You know, I have

Jesus Christ, man .

00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,282
Holy shit.

00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:36,933
Guard.

Housekeeping .

761
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,865
Leave me

00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,038

I don't want anymore

766
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:06,463
I don't wanna take

767
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:08,506
You gotta take
your piIIs, man.

00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:14,012
Yeah , but when
I take them , I don't
get to feeI anything!

769
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:16,348
And if I don't
take them,

770
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:19,976
what I feeI is
too fucking much.

771
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,062
I'm so sorry.

772
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:24,439
I though I couId
Iet off the medication .

773
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:29,069

Look at me.

Fine, man . I'm fine.

with the Bloods.

793
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:07,328
l didn't know it then ,
but my dad made the
deal to protect me.

794
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:11,207
That sure pissed off
Sonny, who was next in
line under my dad.

795
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:47,786
How did it go?

796

You stiII got aII
your fingers and toes?

797
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:59,547
For years I practiced
what I wouId say to him .
I didn't say any of it.

798
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:03,635
You said it aII

No. You were a deaIer.
You deaIt drugs.

804
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:45,468
That's in the past.
That's not who

805
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:49,097
Yeah , but that's
aII know how to do.
It's what I'm good at.

806
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,349
When you were a kid,
what did you wanna be?

807
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:55,729
What was like your dream?

808
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:59,941

809
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:02,068
Oh , that's perfect.

Okay, I know you've been
invoIved with some shady

That's aII

824
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:48,031
You've got nothing

Okay.

826
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,869

TeII where my
fucking son is.

845
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,003
I'm not fucking around.

846
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:09,339
I don't know where
your fucking kid is.

847
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:11,675
Why in the fuck would
you think l know where
your kid is?

848
01:08:11,758 --> 01:08:13,426
'Cause of the money
we fucking owe you.

849
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:15,428
It ain't that much
fucking money, man.

850
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:18,014
I got a kid of my own .
You know that. I don't
take kids.

851
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:21,685
Go ahead and shoot me,
motherfucker. Runs in
the gene pooI , don't it?

852
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,773
Christ.

853
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:29,442
I need your
heIp, Eddie.

854
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,069
What?

855
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:33,029
I need your
fucking heIp.

856
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:36,032
WhiIe you are sitting
there thinking about
this stuff,

857
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:39,703
I want you to run these
changes by Beat, hm?

858
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:42,789
See what he has
to say about this shit.

859
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:46,001
Give me the rest
of my money.

860
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,547
Here's the money
l owe you.

861
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:53,508
I'm done
fighting for good.

862
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:57,053
You piece of shit!

863
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:00,682
Come on . Come on !
You Iike that?
Don't you?

864
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:11,067
l will tell you
about my kid.

865
01:09:11,192 --> 01:09:15,780
lt's just some girl l knew
from home and left me with
a kid and disappeared.

866
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:20,243
I didn't think there was
much I couId do for him so
I put him in a home

867
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:25,081
for the retarded.

868
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:28,251
But there was hell
of a lot l could've
done for him.

869
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:31,880
By the time I reaIized
that, he was gone.

870
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:37,177
Died at eight
years oId . AIone.

871
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,721
In some home.

872
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:48,563
When your fIesh and bIood
needs you, man, and you
cut for the taII grass,

873
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:52,359
everything else just
seems like some farce.

874
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:56,613
So, if you don't wanna fight
more, Chance, okay, that's
cool by me.

875
01:09:56,696 --> 01:10:01,493
But if you cut and run,
if you cut
for the taII grass,

876
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:03,828
take your boy
with you.

877
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:05,705
It's safe there.

878
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:10,377
That's all anybody wants.

879
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,379
To be safe.

880
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:16,383
Thanks, Eddie.

881
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:23,348
Funny how it goes.

882
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:33,316
Oh, no.

883
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:36,528
No.

884
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:39,572
Oh, God.

885
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:43,493
Hey.

886
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,203
Hey, buddy.

887
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,329
Hey, buddy.

888
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,081

Okay.

892
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:22,073
Rath took August.

893
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:27,954
He's a son
of a bitch.

894
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:40,717
Let go.

895
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:53,813
You're okay now.

896
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:55,690
You're okay.

897
01:12:18,129 --> 01:12:19,839
Where's my son?

Every body

903
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:33,645
lt's all cool.

904
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:38,400
All l want is
the money that you
and Beat skimmed from me.

905
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:41,653
That's it.
You give me
my money,

906
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:44,197
I'II give you
back your son .
Okay?

907
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,199
I'm not giving you shit.

908
01:12:46,282 --> 01:12:48,910
You owe me.
Five fucking
years you owe me.

909
01:12:49,035 --> 01:12:52,455
What do you think l'm doing?
l'm setting all this up. lt's
for you , it's for us.

910
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,666
It's what we've
aIways wanted.

911
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,544
That's what you fucking

914
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,552
That's not true.

915

916
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,223

This Iife?
I don't care
about any of this.

921
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:28,950

Twice in 11 years.

952
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:18,870
Meet your
grandson. August.

953
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:22,874
Hey.

954
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:29,923
What the heII
happened to you?

955
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:31,925
Rath's men.

956
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,511
Kidnapped August,
aImost kiIIed PearI.

957
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:37,514
I found out Beat
was running with Rath.

958
01:16:37,597 --> 01:16:40,684
It was too Iate.

959
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,811
Beat's dead.

960
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:53,780
Hey, August, who is
our favorite superhero?

961
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:55,281
Aquaman.

962
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,825
Why fucking Aquaman?

963
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:58,243
Did you hear me?

964
01:16:58,368 --> 01:16:59,994
Yeah . Not in front
of the kid.

965
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,497
Hey, Keyes, take August
down to the other room.

966
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,499
See if you can find him
a SiIver Surfer comic.

967
01:17:04,582 --> 01:17:06,251
But I hate
SiIver surfer.

968
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,837
WeII , I hate
fucking Aquaman.

969
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,382
Go outside, all right,
buddy? l'll be out

970
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:14,050
Oh , that's nice.

971
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:22,308
Did you kiII him?

972
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:23,351
No.

973
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,729
Why the fuck not?

974
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:28,898
'Cause I wanted to make
the right fucking decision
for once in my Iife.

975
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:31,943
Sometimes your right
fucking decision is
the wrong decision.

976
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:34,195
Like you know
the fucking difference?

977
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:36,364
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

978
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:37,866
I never shouId've
come here.

979
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:39,868
Sit your ass
right back there.

980
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,328
Fuck you ! You're
the one who toId me
that I had a choice.

981
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:44,622
This time I made
the right fucking choice.

982
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:47,542
I chose to end up here
the rest of my Iife and
I chose my fucking son.

983
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:50,962
Do you think I
wanted this? Huh?

984
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:53,465
You think I
wanted this shit?

985
01:17:53,548 --> 01:17:55,884
I wanted to be with you .
It just didn't work out.

986
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:59,387
After aII these fucking
years, it just didn't work
out? What the fuck is that?

987
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,015
I think about punching
that fucking guys
Iights out,

988
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:07,312
I think about crushing that
motherfucker skuII every
day of my fucking Iife!

989
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:09,189
What do you
want me to say?

990
01:18:09,272 --> 01:18:11,775
I want you to say
you're fucking sorry
you did it.

991
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:15,653
Yeah , weII , I can't.
I cannot undo what I did .

992
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:18,365
Why did you fucking do it?
Why did you fucking do it?

993
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:21,284
He was raping Beat.

994
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:24,371
He was raping him !

995
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:56,611
Can I ask you somethin'?

996
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:59,322
Sure.

997
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:01,449
Remember that day?

998
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:06,204
You whispered
something in my ear.

999
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:10,875
What did you say?

1000
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:24,157
You need anything?

1001
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,118
Not anymore.

1002
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:31,998
TeII your grandpa bye.

1003
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:35,168
Bye, August.

1004

You take care
of each other.
AII right? Good.

1005
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:08,345
I'm making
a presentation now.

1006
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:10,555
PearI , this is for you.

1007
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,974

Would you like
a band aid?

1010
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:19,731
Yeah . Thank you.

1011
01:22:19,814 --> 01:22:22,859

mean forever.
