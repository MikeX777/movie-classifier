<i>Your respective countries have
deemed you the best at what you do.</i>

00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:24,196
<i>What I will ask you to do
will test you on every level.</i>

<i>No one outside this room
will know who you are</i>

6
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,902
<i>or what we're about to do.</i>

7
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,076
<i>We're in this fight
together, do you understand?</i>

8
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,610
<i>We are not soldiers.</i>

9
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:40,246
<i>Look around me.</i>

10
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,747
<i>Do you think
they will not do this to you?</i>

11
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:45,117
<i>Plans waiting to be started.</i>

12
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,852
<i>The war is raging.</i>

13
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,394
<i>Get along.
Do your jobs. Understood?</i>

14
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,063
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

15
00:01:57,196 --> 00:01:59,698
<i>Excellent.
Let's get this done.</i>

16
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:07,006
<i>Man down,
man down! Let's go!</i>

17
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,175
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

18
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:11,243
<i>This is war!</i>

19
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,215
On me. It's just ahead.
Just over that point.

20
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,354
You sure about this?

21
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,588
I go missing for two months
and you're already doubting me?

22
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,557
No, I'm just saying we're out
in the middle of nowhere

23
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,093
- based on a hunch.
- You don't get it.

24
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,793
This whole team's based
on a fucking hunch.

25
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:30,429
- Relax.
- I'm not going to relax.

26
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,331
This is my mission
and my goddamn team.

27
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:33,966
Man the fuck up!

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,069
What's up his ass?

29
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,603
Don't worry about it, man.

30
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,877
<i>Contact.</i>

31
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:50,016
<i>Here!</i>

32
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:54,686
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

33
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:59,992
Ralph, James... guys?

34
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,797
- Guys, what's your 20?
- <i>Contact.</i>

35
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:08,566
<i>Spread out.
Create some distance between yourselves.</i>

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,802
Report. Guys, where are you?

37
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,804
- <i>Your 12.</i>
- Do you copy?

38
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,473
<i>Just over the hill.</i>

39
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:16,308
<i>Shut up!
We need to finish them off.</i>

40
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,245
Commander Brisco,
Commander Brisco, come in, sir.

41
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:20,413
I think I lost them.

42
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,548
Fuck.

43
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,886
Commander Brisco, go again?
Do you copy?

44
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,788
Does anyone copy?

45
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:33,591
<i>Daniel. I'm waiting.</i>

46
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,593
Face me!

47
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:38,898
Oh, shit! Fuck!

48
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,900
Commander!
Both of our men are down.

49
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,801
We have two down, sir.

50
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:44,669
Hang on, hang on.

51
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:52,111
Does anyone copy?
Repeat, does anyone copy?

52
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:56,115
We got Jacques and Xu both down.
Both KIA.

53
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,184
<i>You're a fighter, Daniel.</i>

54
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,219
<i>I've always
liked that about you.</i>

55
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,357
Show yourself!
Come out of the shadows.

56
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,928
Daniel!

57
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:44,897
Ralph, I'm right here,
all right.

58
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,731
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

59
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,867
Hang on, hang on.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,102
You hear me? Hang on.

61
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,738
Fuck! Shit!

62
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:57,809
Too late.
You were our leader.

63
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,945
We all knew
this would happen.

64
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,647
Just save your breath.
Hold on. I got this, I got this!

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,717
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Fuck!

66
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:07,086
You can't save us!

67
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,786
Listen, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

68
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,856
I'm going to save you,
you understand?

69
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,694
<i>You wanted me, Daniel.</i>

70
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,830
<i>Here I am.</i>

71
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:20,665
I've been waiting for you.

72
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,168
Don't go.

73
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,769
Don't leave me, brother.

74
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:30,042
I gotta finish this.

75
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,684
Draw your weapon.

76
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:42,988
Can you feel it?

77
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,724
The walls around you
are crashing in.

78
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,461
I'm standing here.
I'm here.

79
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:52,131
Just you, Daniel.

80
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,100
Your team is dead.

81
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,803
Your mission is a failure.

82
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:03,775
But at last you will
finally get your kill.

83
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,045
Take the shot.

84
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,148
End it all.

85
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:13,185
The bodies around you
are piled up.

86
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:29,168
Has my life been worth theirs?

87
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:43,776
No, no, no!

88
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,446
You see, I'm more than
just a person.

89
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,249
More than flesh.

90
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:55,954
I'm an idea,
and you can't kill an idea.

91
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,590
Do you understand now,
Daniel?

92
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,313
In three...

93
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,150
Good morning.
I'm Molly Turner,

94
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,386
coming to you live
with breaking news

95
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,456
from an undisclosed location
here in the Middle East.

96
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,558
According to sources,
we have learned

97
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:23,395
that the United States
is conducting a covert operation

98
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,531
here in the desert
surrounding me.

99
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,634
Now the details of
this operation are top secret,

100
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,069
but we do know
that the United States

101
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:34,706
along with Russia, China,
France and the UK,

102
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,676
have formed
a special operations task force

103
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,548
to seek out and destroy a new
age terrorist organization.

104
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,750
Now this comes as
a big surprise to us

105
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,486
as I'm sure it does
to all of our viewers.

106
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:51,290
We can also report that an
American Special Forces soldier

107
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,960
who was captured
has now been freed.

108
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:58,297
We're still not clear on the details
of the mission to free the soldier,

109
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,868
but we're working hard to obtain
more information on that.

110
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:06,873
It seems that our world leaders are
setting aside any and all political issues

111
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,375
in order to come together
and fight as a single unit

112
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,111
for all of our nations
at this time.

113
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:17,082
Again, we will keep you updated on
any new information that we receive.

114
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,650
I'm Molly Turner.

115
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,186
And we are out.

116
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,588
Great job!

117
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,557
Right.

118
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:33,265
What are you guys up to
out there?

119
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,550
Put it on the table.

120
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:00,956
The detonator?

121
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:04,652
Install it under the table.

122
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,975
- Done? Let's go.
- Yes.

123
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,469
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

124
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,716
Well, you look
like shit.

125
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:00,786
How you doin' today,
mate?

126
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,788
Shitty.

127
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:07,693
I can't sleep and I'm stuck in
this bed for a few more days.

128
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:08,995
Why so long?

129
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:13,331
Eh, hand's infected and
they want me to take it easy.

130
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:15,367
How about the leg?

131
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,436
Eh, they ran some tests.

132
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:20,839
The knife went straight through.
Nothin' too serious.

133
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,607
Shit!

134
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,779
Thank you.

135
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,583
- Love you, brother.
- Love you, too, brother.

136
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,619
- Thanks for comin' back.
- Anytime.

137
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,656
Ladies, you need me
to leave the room?

138
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:40,792
Fuck off!

139
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,229
Daniel, you think
you should be walkin' around?

140
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,665
If I don't start now...

141
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,500
Five minutes
are not gonna kill me.

142
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:51,636
Plus, I need to get
outta this fuckin' hellhole.

143
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,638
Fair enough.

144
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,683
How you doin', Daniel?

145
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,986
You know, you're the 12th
person to ask me that.

146
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,487
Good spirits, I see.

147
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,756
I didn't come this far
to sit on the bench.

148
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,824
Well, just take it easy
for now.

149
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:19,932
I think it's time we...
talk about our next operation.

150
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,634
Daniel, my man.
Back in the saddle.

151
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,736
- How you doing?
- He's fine.

152
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:28,807
Okay, I got it. I take it
everyone is asking.

153
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,910
I'll be fine.
Thanks, Jacques.

154
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,845
We're just happy
you're back and doing well.

155
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,181
Appreciate it.

156
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,583
These photos were recovered
from your rescue mission.

157
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:42,554
The tunnels are unique. If you look at the
tunnel walls in each one of these photos,

158
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:44,489
you can see that the rock
is different.

159
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,591
Our analysts are trying
to find their origin.

160
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,027
Sir, how will
they do that?

161
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,828
We have a database
that our analysts back home

162
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:52,198
are cross-checking.
We should have the region soon.

163
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,765
That's great news.

164
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,936
Not quite. We still don't
know what their next move is.

165
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,671
Daniel, I was hoping
you could help us with that.

166
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:03,375
- I'm sure you're all familiar with dirty bombs.
- Familiar?

167
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,212
How many people do you know
have successfully disarmed one?

168
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,580
Their leader spoke a lot
about loyalty

169
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,950
and using powerful chemicals
to get his voice heard.

170
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,819
From what I saw, they're
making compact dirty bombs

171
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,122
that have a much bigger impact.

172
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,490
- Jesus.
- We have to assume

173
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,060
he has multiple compact
dirty bombs being built.

174
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:25,264
Making a statement is the
centerpiece of his next move.

175
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,798
What does he want?

176
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,468
To be an idea.

177
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:48,855
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

178
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:50,607
Good.

179
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:54,256
They're gonna analyze
the photos I left

180
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,622
and fall into my trap.

181
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,600
A care package
from yours truly.

182
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:04,070
How long until we leave?

183
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,804
Not much.

184
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,606
Copy that.

185
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:13,913
Say hello
to my little friends.

186
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,916
<i>Scarface?</i> Al Pacino?

187
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:19,618
We get it.
We all saw the movie.

188
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:25,490
- You guys are no fun.
- Lighten up.

189
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,160
So what's new
with Daniel?

190
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,529
He wants back in.

191
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,598
That makes sense.

192
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,734
He's not ready.

193
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,669
He won't take no for an answer.

194
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,048
Supreme Leader?

195
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:50,570
Yes?

196
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,479
Have you decided?

197
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:53,644
Yes.

198
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,898
I have the list of targets.

199
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:58,408
Good.

200
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:02,851
I want everything to be ready
in 36 hours.

201
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,442
A new world will be born.

202
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:09,884
Indeed.

203
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,877
How we doin'?

204
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,844
Have it down to three
possible locations.

205
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,514
- Timeline?
- Still working on it, sir.

206
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,816
Keep goin'.

207
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,123
Hold on!

208
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:36,529
It needs to be loaded
in the right way.

209
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,916
Watch how I do it.

210
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,427
Not like this.

211
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:45,286
But like this.

212
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:46,817
Not like this.

213
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:47,918
But like this!

214
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,448
Calm and careful.

215
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,016
Understood?

216
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,170
Lock it up.

217
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:19,790
Load it onto the truck.

218
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:24,065
Be careful.

219
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,803
What you workin' on?

220
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,876
These little beauties
are my lifeline.

221
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:58,610
Lifeline?

222
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:00,913
You ever watch
<i>Who Wants to Be a...</i>

223
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,215
No, never mind.

224
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:06,684
Each one of these bad boys
has a fuse in it.

225
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:08,988
Just behind the pin...

226
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:12,024
So you know how
a grenade works, right?

227
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,926
Yes.

228
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,594
Okay. The idea is
to shorten the fuse.

229
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:20,665
Your typical grenade has a life
span of five to seven seconds.

230
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,835
I like to have a few set
between two and three seconds.

231
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,704
What if you drop it?

232
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,175
Buzzkill.

233
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:35,014
What'd you say?

234
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,681
You're crazy!

235
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,184
You're crazy.

236
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,261
How you doing today?

237
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,165
Not bad.

238
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,102
Went to the range.
It felt good.

239
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,811
Let me take a look?

240
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,025
Looks like
it's healing nicely.

241
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,296
So, uh, good to go?

242
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,266
Give it another day.

243
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,537
It was seriously infected.
You went through hell.

244
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:33,239
I know what
I've been through.

245
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,878
But the mind is what
we're most worried about.

246
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,315
I just...

247
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:47,052
I just can't take it easy
knowing that he's out there.

248
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,224
I understand.

249
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:55,861
It's more than duty.

250
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,733
Just think about what
everyone's been saying.

251
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,138
Thanks.

252
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:24,857
How we goin'?

253
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,059
Still haven't found anything.

254
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:29,094
I've narrowed it down
to three locations,

255
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,664
but the images are still
too similar to be sure.

256
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:33,199
I see what you mean.

257
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:36,435
- Damn it!
- Yeah, welcome to my job.

258
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,304
You keep me posted, yes?

259
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,307
- Galina.
- Commander.

260
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:46,545
She giving you a run
for your money?

261
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,881
- Don't get me started.
- Hmm.

262
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,483
- What'd you find?
- Still nothing, sir.

263
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,220
That leaves us only one way
to find out for sure.

264
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,298
Hey, Galina.

265
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,801
Finally someone
who will appreciate this.

266
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:12,938
Here, take a look at this.

267
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,174
You know how
a grenade works, right?

268
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:16,408
Yes.

269
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,245
So I'm taking the fuse

270
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:21,880
and carefully making
slight modifications.

271
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:23,415
He's making it blow up faster.

272
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:25,750
Damn it, Xu!

273
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,720
You work hours and hours,
you spend time...

274
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:31,823
Nice, keep up the good work.
It's good.

275
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,160
War room, guys.
Ten minutes.

276
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:39,298
This'll be brief.
We're having trouble locking down

277
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,401
which of the three locations
with a positive match is correct.

278
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:43,801
Running out of time.

279
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,704
So we'll split up,
cover more ground.

280
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,072
Who's with who?

281
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,675
Galina, Ralph, Xu,
you're together.

282
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,543
James, Jacques,
together.

283
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:53,078
Daniel?

284
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,682
- I'll stay back with you, sir.
- Good call.

285
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,550
There'll be plenty more
for you, mate.

286
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:01,487
Be ready for anything.
We go at first light.

287
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,155
- Sir.
- Excellent.

288
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,173
I'm driving.

289
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,852
Hey,
I'm bad with directions.

290
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,421
Oh, God, help us.

291
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,394
<i>Break it off.
Stay on comms.</i>

292
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:57,476
It should be just ahead.

293
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,878
Nothing out here.

294
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,117
No one's been here
for years.

295
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,905
Heads up. This could
be somethin'.

296
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,515
I don't like this.

297
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,417
Stay cool.

298
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:14,386
We're just here to look.

299
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,035
All right, here.
This is the spot.

300
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,683
You sure this is it?

301
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know, man.
I think we're lost.

302
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,298
I think you're right.

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,669
All right.
It's a bust, man.

304
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,170
Let's move.

305
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:15,314
You shouldn't be here.

306
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:18,550
What's he saying?

307
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,217
You shouldn't be here!

308
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:21,720
Not sure.

309
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,048
Leave now.

310
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:24,423
You speak English?

311
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,032
Go! Leave now!

312
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,626
I don't understand you.

313
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,213
Go! Leave!

314
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,531
Back off!

315
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,466
Easy, huh.

316
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,834
Hey.

317
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:37,703
Take it easy.

318
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,677
We just want to
have a look around.

319
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:47,546
<i>Da?</i>

320
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,715
You come.

321
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,018
Bad thing follow.

322
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,220
Okay.

323
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,289
We don't want to hurt you.

324
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,025
We just want to look around.

325
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,569
The tunnel is
around here somewhere.

326
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:14,239
Just keep moving.

327
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,312
There!

328
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,790
For fuck's sake!
It's a merchant tent.

329
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:35,527
What are you doing?

330
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,296
Relax.

331
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:44,636
You have nice stuff here.

332
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:57,716
We don't have much time.

333
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,651
A few moments, huh?

334
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,034
Anything?

335
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,536
He's lived in tent
long time.

336
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,607
Tunnel is collapsed.
There's nothing here.

337
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:24,743
Okay. Let's go.

338
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,114
We're leaving, okay?

339
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,392
Thank you.

340
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,230
You speak Arabic?

341
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:22,200
A little.
Picked it up on the road.

342
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:24,469
Impressive.

343
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,805
They are just scared.

344
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,808
Yeah, them and me,
too.

345
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,878
Nice people.

346
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:34,613
I wouldn't say nice.

347
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:39,418
Nothing to live on
and a war raging around them.

348
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,820
It's sad.

349
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:49,862
<i>James,
we're headed back to base.</i>

350
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,596
<i>Copy, en route.</i>

351
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,381
How'd it go?

352
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:10,816
Ran into some locals.

353
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,351
They were not too happy
we were there.

354
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:16,421
- You?
- Bust.

355
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:17,990
No one's been
out there for years.

356
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:19,992
A total waste of time.

357
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:22,862
I heard.
Only one location left.

358
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,763
Has to be it.

359
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,509
<i>Syeddy.</i>

360
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,259
We're in the final stages.

361
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,862
It's all coming together.

362
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,730
The West
will see our resolve.

363
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:02,935
Finally, a mutual understanding
on and off the battlefield.

364
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,269
Sixteen years of war.

365
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:07,173
To expect an enemy
to lay down his weapon

366
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:09,508
and cease to fight
is foolish.

367
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,810
As you predicted.

368
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:15,081
They have been foolish to think
this battle has been won.

369
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,581
After our mission is complete,

370
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:19,018
the people of these lands

371
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:22,554
will be able to rise up
and take back what is ours.

372
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,490
All the soldiers in the world
could not stop us now.

373
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,027
Victory is on the horizon.

374
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:31,396
Have you checked the gas
compounds and their detonators?

375
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,934
Yes. Everything
is coming together.

376
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,803
I will provide you
with a smooth detonation

377
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:40,539
with a hard-hitting
gas compound.

378
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,808
In a few days' time,

379
00:32:42,942 --> 00:32:46,344
the world will wake up
to a different reality.

380
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,848
- Good.
- We failed you during our tests at the village.

381
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:53,252
But with additional
research and explosives,

382
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,087
you will not be disappointed.

383
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,223
We cannot have mistakes.

384
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,690
We are too close to victory.

385
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:02,195
Trucks are being loaded
as we speak.

386
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:03,930
When you give us
the target list,

387
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:07,133
nothing will stand in the way
of completing our mission.

388
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,400
You will have your list.

389
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,635
Strike the heart.

390
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,537
The bleed-out across the world

391
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:15,473
will be a domino effect
that will not be ignored.

392
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,608
Excellent.

393
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,878
A swift and deafening blow.

394
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:23,282
The dawn of a new balance
around the world is upon us.

395
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:24,749
Keep on the soldiers.

396
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:27,652
The clock in this war
is almost out of time.

397
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,992
We stand with you till
the very end, Supreme Leader.

398
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,795
A quiet peace
is on the horizon.

399
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:51,978
People...

400
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:54,613
first two tunnels were a bust.

401
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,381
I know what
you're thinking.

402
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:57,749
We have to
stay aggressive.

403
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,118
We've got him
on the run.

404
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:00,518
I agree.

405
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:01,888
Third tunnel is it.

406
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:03,956
I want a quick
sneak and peek operation.

407
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,590
Any additional intel?

408
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:07,159
Not as of now.

409
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,061
Fast. In and out.

410
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:10,629
Exactly.

411
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:13,165
Get in. Find him.
Eliminate him.

412
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,102
- Sir!
- Excellent!

413
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:29,848
This shit ever gonna end?

414
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:32,450
They're like
an infestation of ants.

415
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,519
Squash one,
three more pop up.

416
00:34:34,653 --> 00:34:36,788
We have
a mission to finish.

417
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:07,719
This is it.
We take 'em all. Go home.

418
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:10,488
Up ahead.

419
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:14,126
This has to be it.

420
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,562
<i>Da.</i>

421
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:19,764
This is it.

422
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,170
- Sat comms are spotty in the mountains.
- Understood.

423
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:27,539
<i>We're approaching
the tunnel, sir. Going dark.</i>

424
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,059
<i>Exit up ahead.</i>

425
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:56,634
Look at all this stuff.

426
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:02,208
Oi, keep it down.
We're sitting ducks out here.

427
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,544
All right.

428
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:07,679
Let's move out.

429
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,281
Moving out.

430
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:20,592
Something isn't right.

431
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,795
Yeah, I hear you.

432
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,034
There's nobody here.

433
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,935
Did we miss them?

434
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:32,171
We must have.
This isn't the place.

435
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:35,141
Everything Daniel said.

436
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,246
The sarin, his army, his plan.

437
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:41,981
Doesn't make any sense.

438
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,983
What's the move?

439
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,519
We have to be sure.

440
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,787
You really think
there's a massive army

441
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,123
waiting to pop out
from behind those rocks?

442
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:52,590
That's not the point.

443
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:55,027
They must have left
something behind.

444
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:57,096
Let's go.

445
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,165
They arrive yet?

446
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,732
Approaching now.

447
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:03,102
I hate waiting,
I hate waiting.

448
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:04,870
Tents.

449
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:07,605
Always fucking tents!

450
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,216
On your go.

451
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,025
Clear.

452
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,060
We've got something.

453
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,101
<i>Welcome.</i>

454
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:39,771
<i>You and your precious followers
have been led astray.</i>

455
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:42,441
<i>This war is far from over.</i>

456
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:47,113
<i>Once again, the battle between
two sides of a coin rages.</i>

457
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:48,746
<i>Which side are you on?</i>

458
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:52,318
<i>This country was
the birthplace of mankind,</i>

459
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,587
<i>the center of all humanity,</i>

460
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,424
<i>and you stomp on the dirt beneath
your feet as if it were nothing!</i>

461
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:02,394
<i>These lands have been riddled
with war for thousands of years.</i>

462
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:05,531
<i>It has become a dead zone
for your capitalist ideas.</i>

463
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:08,334
<i>I assure you,
our time has come</i>

464
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:14,106
<i>and we will rise up and
we will take back our lands.</i>

465
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:19,411
Ralph, it's his
final declaration of war.

466
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:27,386
There's nothing else here.

467
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:30,688
Hang on.

468
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,691
What is it?

469
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:38,230
Move!

470
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:50,142
Jesus!

471
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,154
This guy is pissing me off!

472
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:12,331
It's over.

473
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,832
Time to go.

474
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,903
- Let's go.
- This place could be wired.

475
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:34,086
<i>Commander, do you copy?</i>

476
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,388
- Go.
- <i>We were set up.</i>

477
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:38,390
<i>He knew we were coming
every step of the way.</i>

478
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:39,791
Another setup?

479
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:41,360
Always ahead.

480
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:43,462
<i>We're fine.</i>

481
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,537
I, for one, am not fine.

482
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,740
He said something about
the dead zone.

483
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,277
That mean
something to you?

484
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,746
I do not know.
I need to get to a computer.

485
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,083
We need to get
the hell out of here.

486
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,319
Movin' out.

487
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,535
<i>On final approach.</i>

488
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:25,137
<i>Three minutes out.</i>

489
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:43,122
- You guys good?
- We're good.

490
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,292
Oi, what's up
with her?

491
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,427
We walked right
into a trap.

492
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,529
Galina!

493
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:53,699
Get to medical. You need a full
evaluation and medical report.

494
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,800
I don't have time
for medical.

495
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:57,903
He is toying with us.

496
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,705
Whatever he is planning
is happening now!

497
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,707
- Medical first, then the war room.
- But I have to...

498
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,376
I understand, but you need
to get checked out first.

499
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,578
Then tackle other issues.
Go on.

500
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:08,180
All right.

501
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:11,050
Slow down. Man!

502
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:12,885
She's just focused.

503
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,819
When she's onto something,
she's on it.

504
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:16,522
She's Russian.

505
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:20,626
Good?

506
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:22,728
Yes, sir.
Minor scrapes.

507
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:24,330
They are not playing around
out there.

508
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,598
We're on the frontline
for the world.

509
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,500
Can't fail.

510
00:41:49,054 --> 00:41:51,924
According to the scouts,
the trap has gone off.

511
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:53,894
Are they dead?

512
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,501
No. There's no evidence
confirming that yet.

513
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,638
Then find out.

514
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,093
I want them dead!

515
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:05,412
Yes, Supreme Leader!

516
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:11,289
Come on, go.

517
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:19,184
Do you have any files
on the dead zone?

518
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:23,722
A list of all forward operating
bases left behind after the war?

519
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:25,491
Let me check.

520
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:27,526
Doesn't look like much.

521
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:29,628
We dismasted or destroyed
most of our outposts

522
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:30,864
when we pulled out.

523
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:32,931
Mmm, but not all of them.

524
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,566
There.

525
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,170
I have a file labeled under
Locations as a dead zone.

526
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:42,374
That's crazy.
Why would we leave an FBO in place?

527
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:46,612
Money. It costs more to take
it down than to leave it.

528
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:50,849
Well, it must have been
a hot extraction point, too,

529
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:54,019
because it looks like everybody
left that location in a hurry.

530
00:42:54,153 --> 00:42:56,555
Yeah, and we don't have
much on it in the database.

531
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:58,290
It's perfect.

532
00:42:58,424 --> 00:42:59,525
Wait, what?

533
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,896
Perfect place to hide.

534
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:05,063
Right in front of our face.

535
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:11,603
I want everything to be ready
when we receive the order.

536
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,318
Supreme Leader.

537
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:18,788
- Are we ready?
- Yes. This way.

538
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:24,616
What'd you find?

539
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,051
The dead zone.

540
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:27,719
It was a hot zone
during the war.

541
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,154
It's not just a zone.

542
00:43:29,288 --> 00:43:31,723
It is the name of an FBO
used during the war.

543
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,427
- They're using it as operations base.
- How do you know?

544
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,864
In the video,
he mentioned it.

545
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:42,367
Everything he has said to date has
been incredibly specific and arrogant.

546
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:45,604
He put it right in front
of our face just because.

547
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:47,172
Walk me through it.

548
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:49,441
Middle of nowhere.

549
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,276
A lot of room to move around.

550
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,846
Who would ever think to look
in their own backyard?

551
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:55,547
It's the perfect place to hide.

552
00:43:55,681 --> 00:43:57,349
- You sure?
- Sir,

553
00:43:57,483 --> 00:43:59,551
this is the place, I'm telling you.

554
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,387
Marino, let's get eyes in
the sky over in that area.

555
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,523
Monitoring from above
will not help.

556
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,526
We've been playing from behind
for too long.

557
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:10,195
It's time to turn the tables.
We need to move in now.

558
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,798
No, we can't continue
to roam around the desert

559
00:44:12,932 --> 00:44:14,132
hoping to stumble
into something.

560
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:16,268
- Sir...
- I believe you, trust me, I do,

561
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,469
but I need
a closer look.

562
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:18,872
Get me Jacques
and Xu.

563
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,405
Yes, sir.

564
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:27,279
Commander Brisco
wants to see you both. Now.

565
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:32,317
Great.
What did I do now?

566
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,857
What's going on?

567
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:39,424
Good, you're here.

568
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:41,393
Galina found a possible
operations base.

569
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,328
I want you both
to check it out.

570
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:45,330
- What do you mean, "check it out"?
- Exactly that.

571
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:47,299
Get as close as you can
and get a positive ID.

572
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:49,268
- Understood.
- Excellent.

573
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:51,303
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

574
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,902
Coming up on the location.

575
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:24,436
Just over there.

576
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,405
We should be able
to see them.

577
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:29,241
Remember, quietly.

578
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:43,589
Contact.

579
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:51,229
Galina was right.

580
00:45:52,364 --> 00:45:54,266
- Good work.
- Thank you.

581
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:56,401
Did they find
something?

582
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:57,769
Do we have overheads yet?

583
00:45:57,904 --> 00:45:59,371
Coming up now,
sir.

584
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:08,513
This is going off.

585
00:46:17,056 --> 00:46:18,457
Let's get out of here.

586
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,428
Those crates.

587
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:25,597
They're being loaded
into trucks.

588
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:28,300
He's moving soon.

589
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:35,540
- How is it out there?
- Hot. Damn hot.

590
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:38,310
They're moving.
And fast.

591
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:39,645
Daniel was right.

592
00:46:39,778 --> 00:46:41,613
Those guys
aren't messing around.

593
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,499
Supreme Leader.

594
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:02,267
We are ready.

595
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:04,836
Good.

596
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:06,371
The list is complete.

597
00:47:06,505 --> 00:47:08,407
The men have their orders.

598
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,979
By sundown tomorrow,
the trucks will be off the base

599
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,313
and on their way.

600
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:16,815
Excellent.

601
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:18,483
My leader.

602
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:20,185
I find myself
thinking back

603
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:22,554
to the very beginning
of this mission.

604
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:25,024
How far we have come together.

605
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:29,428
Two soldiers
left to die in the sand,

606
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,931
both left with
the scars of war.

607
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:36,969
Together we found
the bravery to stand against

608
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:41,040
what was forced upon
so many across these lands.

609
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:45,144
For too long,
they have stood there

610
00:47:45,277 --> 00:47:48,047
barking their orders,
stealing our wealth,

611
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:49,681
changing our way of life.

612
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:54,386
<i>Syeddy,</i> the West will never
understand our world.

613
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:57,924
They look at us
and see a group of terrorists.

614
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:01,660
They cannot see
beyond the mask.

615
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:06,966
They fail to see two soldiers
who served their country.

616
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,801
Two fathers...

617
00:48:12,437 --> 00:48:13,906
who lost...

618
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:17,076
their wives and children.

619
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,347
They look at us and see
a group of men with masks,

620
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,184
with a gun in hand.

621
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,854
History will not
be kind to us.

622
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:32,791
No, but history
will always have a place

623
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:35,327
for those who stood up
for what was right,

624
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,865
no matter the cost,
no matter the cause.

625
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:42,902
You have been loyal to this
cause from the very beginning.

626
00:48:43,035 --> 00:48:45,972
You have led us fiercely.

627
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:49,008
No matter the outcome
of the upcoming days,

628
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:51,911
they will know
where we stand.

629
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:54,713
They will know what
we have been fighting for.

630
00:48:54,846 --> 00:48:57,884
We stand with you
until the very end.

631
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:03,722
One final address, live.

632
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:05,258
<i>Syeddy.</i>

633
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,658
Live?

634
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,828
Yes.
I want it to go out

635
00:49:09,962 --> 00:49:12,631
to all the people
all over these lands.

636
00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:15,168
But, uh, the team,
they will...

637
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,937
We are at
the final stages of this war.

638
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,572
The team cannot stop us now.

639
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,109
One final address then.

640
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:26,411
Our people must know, they must
understand the work we have done.

641
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:31,284
They will hear and see everything
that we have accomplished.

642
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,853
Your words
will give them strength.

643
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:39,091
They will rise up
without fear, as we did.

644
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:43,562
This mission
has taught me many things,

645
00:49:44,596 --> 00:49:47,666
but most importantly,
resilience.

646
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:51,503
You have fought back

647
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:54,974
from the forgotten depths
of the desert,

648
00:49:55,107 --> 00:50:00,445
formed a coalition,
and gained faith in your ideas

649
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:02,480
across these lands.

650
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:08,720
Our people owe you a great debt
for your leadership.

651
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,689
Debt?

652
00:50:10,822 --> 00:50:13,192
That is not something
I wish to collect.

653
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:16,996
Our people needed
an idea, a cause.

654
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:21,100
They needed one unified voice,
one sword.

655
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:26,239
A sword that you have sharpened
with your own blood and given to us.

656
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:29,275
Without your leadership,
these lands would have been lost.

657
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:34,347
Factions of soldiers scattered all over
our lands without a reason to fight back.

658
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:36,949
You gave them that reason.

659
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,317
You made them believe.

660
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,654
Looking down,
you see them united

661
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:46,092
under one mask,
under one idea.

662
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:48,060
Do not believe in me.

663
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:52,530
Believe in an idea so much stronger
than any man with a weapon.

664
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,499
Or a country with a military.

665
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:56,501
Yes, we believe in you.

666
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:57,970
We're all soldiers

667
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:00,106
fighting on a battlefield
at the end of the day.

668
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,275
We stand with you
until the very end.

669
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,511
At this very moment, the team
is out there hunting us.

670
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:08,114
They will make
their last stand,

671
00:51:08,247 --> 00:51:09,916
but without true conviction,

672
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:12,218
they will fail
to bring us to our knees.

673
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,818
It will be too late.

674
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:15,988
Their mission will be
a complete failure.

675
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:18,291
We have come too close
for assumptions.

676
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:21,861
<i>Syeddy,</i> we have come
too far to fail.

677
00:51:21,994 --> 00:51:23,329
They can come,

678
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:25,664
but they will be met
with more firepower

679
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,666
than they ever
thought possible.

680
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:31,137
I want soldiers guarding
the base around the clock.

681
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,737
Yes, Supreme Leader.

682
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:34,472
Good.

683
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:37,509
The sun is setting on us,
my friend.

684
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,846
It is a beautiful sunset,
indeed.

685
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:45,217
In time, they will come
to understand our ideas.

686
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,652
In time, <i>syeddy,</i>
in time.

687
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:49,956
Gather the men.

688
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:53,993
I want to address our lands one last time

689
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:56,262
and finish
what we started together.

690
00:51:56,395 --> 00:52:00,765
We will be awaiting your
presence, my Supreme Leader.

691
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:02,734
No mistakes.

692
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:07,039
This war ends now.

693
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,241
Of course.

694
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,655
Clear head?

695
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:26,591
All clear.
Ready to press forward, sir.

696
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:27,994
Join your team.

697
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:36,168
We are ready.

698
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:39,016
We leave at dawn.

699
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,511
Are you getting
irregularities?

700
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,917
I'm getting a lot of
web traffic over here.

701
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:55,520
He's about to go live.

702
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:56,922
Get Commander Brisco!

703
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:00,026
Ready?

704
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:05,164
- Smith?
- Sir.

705
00:53:05,297 --> 00:53:07,832
- What is it?
- You're gonna wanna see this.

706
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:13,305
- Get them in here.
- Yes, sir.

707
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:16,142
What is this?

708
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:27,453
They're about to go live
with a video feed.

709
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:28,720
Go ahead.

710
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:31,924
Western World,
I say this to you

711
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:34,793
out of my belief
and overwhelming conviction

712
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:38,763
<i>that I and my people are forever
meant to balance this world.</i>

713
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:44,203
For too long, you have taken our
wealth, our land and our oil.

714
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:47,605
You will soon understand
what I stand for.

715
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:50,076
This ends now!

716
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:54,113
We have to finish
what we started.

717
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:57,782
If we don't come out on top,
all of this will be for nothing.

718
00:53:58,551 --> 00:53:59,952
The world's watching.

719
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:02,321
You know what's at stake.

720
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,193
The ultimate sacrifice
may be required.

721
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:10,229
Who's in?

722
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:11,796
I'm in.

723
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,232
I'm with you.

724
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:16,936
And I will stand with you.

725
00:54:19,604 --> 00:54:20,906
I'm in.

726
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:27,079
Well, you're all screwed
without me, so I'm in.

727
00:54:27,745 --> 00:54:29,315
Good.

728
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:30,815
Start prepping.

729
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:36,989
- Commander Brisco?
- <i>Yes. I need the president.</i>

730
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,958
<i>We're about to move
on the location.</i>

731
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,327
That's great news.
He's coming on now.

732
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,602
Commander, I'm here.

733
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:51,237
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

734
00:54:52,737 --> 00:54:54,406
I'm hearing good news.

735
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,209
<i>All our intel points to
a forward base of operations</i>

736
00:54:57,343 --> 00:54:59,912
<i>deserted in the dead zone
after the war.</i>

737
00:55:00,778 --> 00:55:02,114
The dead zone?

738
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:04,283
<i>One of our FOBs was,
um, overrun.</i>

739
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:06,118
<i>We never reclaimed it,
and they've been using it</i>

740
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:08,786
<i>as a base of operations
right under our noses.</i>

741
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,923
<i>The tunnels
were just a distraction.</i>

742
00:55:11,056 --> 00:55:12,690
What about the sarin bombs?

743
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:15,427
<i>I don't have a bomb count,
but I know he has them.</i>

744
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:19,899
Hmm. Well, I want to
make sure we secure the FBO.

745
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,101
Nothing gets out of there.

746
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:25,670
<i>I'm confident my men can
contain the situation, sir.</i>

747
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:29,475
- Failure is not an option here, Commander.
- <i>We won't fail.</i>

748
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:32,578
Good. I'm ordering Predator
drones into the area now.

749
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,180
If things should get
out of hand,

750
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:36,448
we're gonna put
a Hellfire missile on his head.

751
00:55:36,582 --> 00:55:38,884
<i>Sir, my men will be
on the ground.</i>

752
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:40,386
I understand that.

753
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:43,322
It'll be my call and one
that I have to live with.

754
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,925
The lives of few
for the lives of many,

755
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:48,793
but let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

756
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,196
<i>We'll get it done.</i>

757
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:52,565
Godspeed.
Let's get this done.

758
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:54,233
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

759
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,851
Let's finish this.

760
00:56:16,555 --> 00:56:18,224
She never jams.

761
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,394
Thanks.

762
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,831
- How's it going?
- We'll be ready, sir.

763
00:56:29,235 --> 00:56:32,104
I don't have to tell you
what's at stake out there,

764
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,607
how many lives at risk
if they smuggle those bombs out.

765
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,176
Down in flames
or nothing at all.

766
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:41,947
Move fast
and get it done out there.

767
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:43,315
Copy that, sir.

768
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:45,817
It's a few hours
before sunrise.

769
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:47,987
Good luck.

770
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,888
- Sir!
- Excellent!

771
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:21,520
<i>We're inbound.</i>

772
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:23,055
<i>Happy hunting.</i>

773
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,870
Three klicks,
north-northeast.

774
00:57:38,003 --> 00:57:39,371
This is it.

775
00:57:39,505 --> 00:57:42,875
- All right. We gotta move.
- Weapons tight.

776
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:45,577
Hit 'em hard and fast.
Make sure your shots count.

777
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:48,180
Look who's back in full swing.

778
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:50,848
Sat image is showing
heavy movement.

779
00:57:50,983 --> 00:57:53,952
We're going to have
serious company.

780
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:58,023
Let's do this!

781
00:57:58,157 --> 00:58:00,192
Okay.
Move out, move out!

782
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:41,233
A ton of movement down there.

783
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,936
What's the move?

784
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:46,138
One guard shack,
far-side entrance.

785
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:47,673
Guard towers
on every corner.

786
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:50,976
Going to be difficult
for a quiet entrance.

787
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,313
We're gonna need
someone on the inside.

788
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:55,848
Xu, you're up.

789
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:57,282
Copy.

790
00:59:38,824 --> 00:59:40,058
<i>I'm at the base.</i>

791
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:41,960
You're clear.

792
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:48,267
- How we doin'?
- Good.

793
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,669
They're in position.
Sat feed is strong.

794
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:52,404
- Drone status?
- Minutes away.

795
00:59:52,538 --> 00:59:55,407
Weapons system will be active
when it reaches the area.

796
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,776
Let's keep that card
in our back pocket.

797
00:59:57,911 --> 00:59:59,244
Understood, sir.

798
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,230
Guard is moving
to the other side.

799
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:19,965
You're clear. Move.

800
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:34,513
Xu, on my count.

801
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:38,116
Three, two, one.

802
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:46,725
Okay. Change out.
Get to the main entrance.

803
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:12,050
He's in.

804
01:01:12,184 --> 01:01:14,019
This better work.

805
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,521
It'll work.

806
01:01:15,654 --> 01:01:17,389
Guard tower two.

807
01:01:23,662 --> 01:01:25,130
Tower two clear.

808
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,475
Xu, get to the guard shack
and clear us a path in.

809
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:49,321
When Xu clears that path,
we move.

810
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:51,356
Jacques, you're with me.

811
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,125
- Copy.
- Cover the wall.

812
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:56,662
Ralph, James, we're going in
the front door, boys.

813
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:59,631
Daniel...
you ready for this?

814
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:01,400
Let's move.

815
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:05,637
Here we go!

816
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,815
Why are you so late?

817
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,792
Main gate is clear.

818
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:28,327
Move in.

819
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:44,643
Xu, find that bomb.

820
01:02:56,488 --> 01:02:58,123
We're in the tower.

821
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:05,898
Jacques, eyes on the main gate.
Be ready.

822
01:03:31,423 --> 01:03:32,992
There's dozens
of crates in here.

823
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:34,760
<i>One by one,
check them all.</i>

824
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,863
<i>We have to make sure
nothing gets out.</i>

825
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,556
Galina, keep steady.
Do not fire.

826
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:13,966
Holding.

827
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:21,740
Shit!

828
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,177
They're moving
a transport truck.

829
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:26,344
Xu, what's your status?

830
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,886
Xu, do you copy? Status!

831
01:04:34,419 --> 01:04:36,022
I got eyes on the bombs.

832
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:37,789
They're not activated yet.

833
01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:42,427
But they're ready
to move out.

834
01:04:43,996 --> 01:04:45,430
Xu!

835
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:48,935
Hey, you!
What are you doing there?

836
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:52,872
They're here!

837
01:04:53,772 --> 01:04:56,075
Arm one of the bombs.
I want them dead!

838
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:57,442
Do not fail me!

839
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:04,349
Oh, shit!

840
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:17,997
We have company.

841
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:19,132
Weapons free.

842
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,441
Daniel!

843
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:32,277
Daniel!

844
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,499
Daniel!

845
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:56,468
Daniel, we have to move!

846
01:05:56,601 --> 01:06:00,039
Daniel, come here.
Snap out of it. Hey, hey.

847
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:04,911
Daniel! Now get up
and let's fuckin' kill 'em all!

848
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,182
We're fucked!
This was a bad idea.

849
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:11,284
- Daniel.
- All right, all right.

850
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,019
- You got it!
- Daniel, we have to move!

851
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:15,387
Ah!

852
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,535
Cover me.
I'm going in.

853
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,119
Buy me some time!

854
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,855
Working on it.

855
01:06:50,655 --> 01:06:52,424
There's too many of them.

856
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,593
<i>Merci.</i>

857
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:56,062
Where's that bomb?

858
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:59,364
Clear a path.
Jacques, get to that bomb!

859
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:25,958
Found it!

860
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:27,592
Can you disarm it?

861
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:30,229
I'm working on it.

862
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:31,730
Okay.

863
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:36,869
Okay. Red... blue.

864
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,073
- Move!
- Ah!

865
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:54,020
- It's disarmed. Clear.
- Let's go!

866
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,989
Good work, good work!

867
01:08:03,129 --> 01:08:04,529
Move to the barracks.
Let's go!

868
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,966
Copy that.
On the way.

869
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,976
Coming your way!

870
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,478
Whoa, don't shoot.
It's me!

871
01:08:21,914 --> 01:08:23,015
Xu!

872
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:25,483
Xu, what the fuck, man?
Lose the mask.

873
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,287
Let's move!

874
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:30,089
Coming!

875
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:32,224
- I'm right behind you.
- Go, let's go!

876
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,540
Let's go!

877
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:52,510
Look out!

878
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,480
Fuck! I'm out.

879
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:57,116
Changing.

880
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:24,809
Stop that truck! Let's go.
We need to stop that truck!

881
01:09:25,478 --> 01:09:26,711
Blow the gate!

882
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,881
I'm working on it.

883
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:46,032
Watch out!

884
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,868
Move! Move!

885
01:10:00,578 --> 01:10:02,515
Supreme Leader,
we have to leave the base.

886
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,050
Shh.

887
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:10,649
Supreme Leader. Supreme Leader,
we have to leave here ASAP.

888
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:12,585
Without you,
there is no mission.

889
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:17,197
Let's go.

890
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:25,603
There he goes!
Cover me.

891
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:51,729
Move, move, move!

892
01:10:51,864 --> 01:10:54,666
Shit.

893
01:11:11,716 --> 01:11:13,185
Kill them.

894
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:15,890
I assure you,
we won't fail.

895
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,148
See you soon, my friend.

896
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:32,304
Forward.

897
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:34,672
On me.

898
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:44,483
Anyone hit?

899
01:11:44,617 --> 01:11:45,851
All good?

900
01:11:46,352 --> 01:11:47,353
I'm fine.

901
01:11:48,786 --> 01:11:49,787
He's not here.

902
01:11:49,922 --> 01:11:52,525
Daniel, he's in the lab.

903
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:53,592
<i>Copy that.</i>

904
01:11:53,725 --> 01:11:55,094
Let's finish this, son.

905
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,761
Yes, sir.

906
01:11:57,596 --> 01:11:58,830
I got this.

907
01:11:58,964 --> 01:12:00,266
You sure you're good?

908
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,939
Go!

909
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:16,769
I told you, Daniel,
one way or the other,

910
01:14:16,902 --> 01:14:19,038
this was going to end
my way.

911
01:14:20,973 --> 01:14:22,675
It's not over.

912
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:24,343
You still
don't understand.

913
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:28,547
Ideas are much stronger
than any bomb, any war.

914
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:31,517
Whether I win or you win today,

915
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,818
tomorrow someone else
will pick up where I left off.

916
01:14:33,952 --> 01:14:37,222
How about I stop you today
and we'll deal with tomorrow?

917
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:44,897
Hold them off!

918
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,066
Incoming!

919
01:14:58,944 --> 01:15:00,346
Let's go!

920
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:02,581
Let's go.

921
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,053
You cannot be everywhere.

922
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:14,393
Did I get too close?

923
01:15:20,799 --> 01:15:23,135
I do miss our conversations.

924
01:15:25,371 --> 01:15:27,473
You and I are not
that different.

925
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:30,476
Devoted to our countries.

926
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,545
And we both have lost somebody.

927
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,447
I'm nothin' like you.

928
01:15:58,837 --> 01:15:59,805
Let's move!

929
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,373
On you.

930
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:14,186
You have your honor.
I have mine.

931
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,789
You have your loyalty,
I have mine.

932
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:21,326
You have your mission,
and I have mine.

933
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:24,463
You're weak.

934
01:16:24,596 --> 01:16:26,165
Spinning out of control.

935
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:27,599
Toss it.

936
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:32,070
Rifle too.

937
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:41,480
Up.

938
01:16:41,613 --> 01:16:43,649
You seem to be
in this situation a lot.

939
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:44,750
Only with you.

940
01:16:44,884 --> 01:16:46,652
Oh, Daniel,
I'm touched.

941
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:49,221
Get up!

942
01:16:57,062 --> 01:16:58,697
Move!

943
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:02,468
Move!

944
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:08,240
Circle up!

945
01:17:09,975 --> 01:17:11,343
You hear that?

946
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:14,213
Your team is
being overrun.

947
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,683
My weapons
are being moved.

948
01:17:18,952 --> 01:17:20,619
I wouldn't count them out.

949
01:17:20,752 --> 01:17:23,288
Maybe, maybe not.

950
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:26,358
My men came here today
ready to die.

951
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:27,559
Did yours?

952
01:17:29,761 --> 01:17:33,532
Roger... Go!

953
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:52,384
Soon my weapons will be scattered
across Europe, ready to deploy.

954
01:17:52,518 --> 01:17:56,856
I have enough sarin bombs
to wipe out entire cities.

955
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,524
Moments from now,

956
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:02,561
they will escape
and carry out my mission.

957
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:08,033
Always remember you and your team have failed.

958
01:18:39,765 --> 01:18:41,166
I'm on him.

959
01:18:58,051 --> 01:18:59,585
No!

960
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:09,761
This... is for you.

961
01:19:11,898 --> 01:19:13,432
This is not over!

962
01:19:14,067 --> 01:19:15,667
It's not over.

963
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:53,472
Drive out the truck now!

964
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,648
Go with him!

965
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,649
Get the truck!

966
01:21:16,189 --> 01:21:17,489
Fuck!

967
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,357
- Send the drone in.
- Yes, sir.

968
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:21,426
Locking target.
Two minutes.

969
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:50,622
This...

970
01:21:50,756 --> 01:21:52,024
isn't the end.

971
01:21:52,524 --> 01:21:54,259
It is for you.

972
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:00,900
Target acquired.

973
01:22:01,033 --> 01:22:02,101
You have my go.

974
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:03,802
- Target locked.
- Fire!

975
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:20,079
Sir, we're all
accounted for and clear.

976
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:23,615
Sending your ride to you.

977
01:23:23,748 --> 01:23:24,984
You're comin' home.

978
01:23:26,484 --> 01:23:28,054
Welcome back, brother.

979
01:23:29,188 --> 01:23:30,622
You good, mate?

980
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:33,525
Yeah.

981
01:23:34,126 --> 01:23:35,328
It's done.

982
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,595
Let's go home.

983
01:23:36,728 --> 01:23:39,332
- Yeah.
- Good work, guys.

984
01:23:39,464 --> 01:23:41,533
The war's far from over.

985
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:44,237
Only the dead
have seen the end of war.

986
01:23:44,369 --> 01:23:47,106
I'm not gonna miss it here.

987
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,774
What do you think
will happen to this place?

988
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,643
Politicians will take over.

989
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:54,080
On the matter of the future,

990
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:56,581
today we found
a little bit of peace.

991
01:23:56,715 --> 01:24:00,119
Peace to the brothers
who gave their lives before us

992
01:24:01,187 --> 01:24:03,222
so we could make this mission
a success.

993
01:24:03,356 --> 01:24:04,689
Amen, brother.

994
01:24:05,824 --> 01:24:07,226
Let's get out of here.

995
01:24:08,426 --> 01:24:10,528
I feel like we're bonding.

996
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:12,464
It only took us three months.

997
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:15,334
Hey, Xu, everyone
really likes your new outfit.

998
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,203
- But you dropped this.
- Oh!

999
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,805
Seriously though,
it was the digs.

1000
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:10,189
People...

1001
01:25:14,427 --> 01:25:15,928
I have to hand it to you.

1002
01:25:16,062 --> 01:25:19,165
Odds were against you,
and you pulled it off.

1003
01:25:19,298 --> 01:25:21,033
Thank you, Commander.

1004
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:23,336
These past few months
have been hell on all of us.

1005
01:25:23,468 --> 01:25:26,038
And I have to say that you're
some of the toughest,

1006
01:25:26,172 --> 01:25:28,673
bravest soldiers I know.

1007
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:33,678
Next time you're lookin'
for a fight,

1008
01:25:34,413 --> 01:25:35,814
count me in.

1009
01:25:37,682 --> 01:25:38,985
Dismissed.

1010
01:25:39,452 --> 01:25:40,652
Sir.

1011
01:26:16,188 --> 01:26:17,522
Hey.

1012
01:26:17,655 --> 01:26:19,091
Packing up already?

1013
01:26:19,225 --> 01:26:20,825
You know how it works.

1014
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,528
Back to the States,
look for my next check.

1015
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:26,065
Yeah, I hear you on that.

1016
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:29,567
How about you?

1017
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:31,703
Think I'm gonna
take some time off.

1018
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:34,106
This mission was...

1019
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:35,640
different.

1020
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,742
This place
and these people...

1021
01:26:40,312 --> 01:26:41,679
Don't go soft on me.

1022
01:26:43,182 --> 01:26:44,749
Soft?

1023
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:46,584
Never that, mate.

1024
01:26:49,188 --> 01:26:50,322
Hey...

1025
01:26:51,924 --> 01:26:53,658
you were good out there.

1026
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:55,827
We were good.

1027
01:27:00,099 --> 01:27:02,535
And take care of
those locks of love.

1028
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,403
They fit you, man.

1029
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,409
That's a good one,
Mr. President.

1030
01:27:10,543 --> 01:27:11,944
Well done, Commander.

1031
01:27:12,078 --> 01:27:14,313
I never doubted the team
for a second.

1032
01:27:14,846 --> 01:27:16,348
All is well.

1033
01:27:17,216 --> 01:27:19,418
I think a vacation
might be due.

1034
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:22,088
No, I hate vacations.

1035
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:24,557
Well...

1036
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:28,760
You pass along my regards
to the team and my thanks.

1037
01:27:28,894 --> 01:27:30,296
Will do, sir.

1038
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:37,602
What's next
for you two?

1039
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:41,840
- I'm going on tour.
- Again?

1040
01:27:41,974 --> 01:27:44,310
I'm gettin' the band
back together.

1041
01:27:44,443 --> 01:27:46,178
- Snakeheads.
- Nice!

1042
01:27:46,879 --> 01:27:48,481
It's punk rock.

1043
01:27:48,613 --> 01:27:51,150
I am going to sit
on a beach...

1044
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:53,685
get a tan...

1045
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,720
have a drink.

1046
01:28:01,594 --> 01:28:05,297
Stay safe, boys. I can't be on
every mission watching your backs.

1047
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:10,903
It's been a fun ride.

1048
01:28:13,172 --> 01:28:15,141
I think
I'll miss you most.

1049
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,709
You still crazy.

1050
01:28:24,283 --> 01:28:25,417
You all right?

1051
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:28,020
You gonna miss it?

1052
01:28:30,089 --> 01:28:31,157
No.

1053
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:34,792
You always had my back.

1054
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:37,096
- Brothers, dude.
- Yeah.

1055
01:28:38,531 --> 01:28:40,633
Nah, this mission...

1056
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:43,269
- Yeah, completely fucked.
- Come on.

1057
01:28:55,147 --> 01:28:57,416
You know, the world
owes you people a lot.

1058
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:02,221
Now get outta here
before somethin' else happens.

1059
01:29:02,354 --> 01:29:03,322
Yes, sir!

1060
01:29:03,455 --> 01:29:05,057
Get the hell outta here!

1061
01:29:13,966 --> 01:29:16,001
Best damn team ever.

1062
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,600
