1
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:30,823
I have the feeling that I should
be angry with this child...

2
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:35,495
with this childish young thing,
or I shouldn't forgive her...

3
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:40,124
for not realizing the horrors,
the monster, before it was too late.

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,836
For not realizing
what she was getting into.

5
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,465
How could I have agreed to it
so impulsively?

6
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:51,427
I was not an enthusiastic Nazi.

7
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:55,598
When I came to Berlin,
I could have said, "No.

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:01,771
I won't take part. I don't want
to be sent to the Führer HQ".

9
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:07,360
But I didn't say no.
Curiosity got the better of me.

10
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,154
And I simply never thought...

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,700
that fate would take me somewhere
I'd never really wanted to be.

12
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:19,497
And yet, it's very hard
to forgive myself for doing it.

13
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,381
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,217
Military District II has confirmed.

15
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,177
You may pass.

16
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,085
FUHRER'S HEADQUARTERS
"WOLFSSCHANZE"

17
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,296
RASTENBURG, EAST PRUSSIA,
NOVEMBER 1942

18
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,801
Please take a seat, ladies.

19
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,764
I must ask you to wait
a few minutes.

20
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,767
The Führer is feeding his dog.
He will be with you shortly.

21
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,148
Tell me... How do we...
How does one greet the Führer?

22
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:32,111
The Fuhrer will speak to you first,
and you just say, "Heil, my Fuhrer".

23
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,113
What about the Nazi salute?

24
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:39,327
That won't be necessary. The Führer
isn't recruiting you as soldiers...

25
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:42,330
he's looking for a secretary.

26
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,082
Behave normally.

27
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:48,086
Just be natural. I'll ask him
if he has time for you now.

28
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,551
My Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

29
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:19,575
I'd like to thank you for coming
in the middle of the night, ladies.

30
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:25,581
But in war, we aren't always
masters of our own time.

31
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:31,587
- May I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz. Heil, my Führer.

32
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,382
- Where are you from?
- Fulda. Heil, my Führer.

33
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,177
- And you?
- Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, my Führer.

34
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:42,223
Leave that out, child.
Tell me where you're from.

35
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,600
Frankfurt on the Main, my Führer.

36
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,564
I'm Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

37
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,608
To be precise, I come from Pankow.

38
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,571
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Swabia.

39
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,406
And you?

40
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,409
Traudl Humps.
I come from Munich.

41
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,247
A Munich girl.

42
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:17,091
So, Fräulein Humps,
shall we start?

43
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:31,898
Blondi won't hurt you.
She has a very sharp mind.

44
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,651
In fact, she's more clever
than most people are.

45
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,617
Just make yourself comfortable.

46
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:47,246
Don't be nervous. I make
so many mistakes when I dictate...

47
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,292
you'll never make as many as I do.

48
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,804
You're quite young.

49
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,682
- How old are you?
- 22, my Führer.

50
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,816
"My national comrades...

51
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:19,487
German men and women,
members of the Party...

52
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,574
it is, I believe, a rare thing...

53
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,538
that a man can stand before...

54
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,542
his old supporters
after 20 years in office...

55
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,337
and that during those 20 years...

56
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:41,008
he did not have to modify
his policies whatsoever."

57
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:59,569
I suggest that we try it again.

58
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,749
I made it!
He gave me a job!

59
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,304
BERLIN, APRIL 20, 1945
ADOLF HITLER'S 56TH BIRTHDAY

60
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,015
TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER

61
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,439
Duck!

62
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:44,447
Keep moving!
Get off the street!

63
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,783
Duck!

64
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,756
That's artillery.

65
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,635
Are you crazy?
How could they be firing artillery?

66
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,264
Frau Junge, you're right!
Those aren't bombs, it's artillery!

67
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,600
It's the Russians.
What a fine birthday present!

68
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:22,109
What's going on, Burgdorf?
Where's that gunfire coming from?

69
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,820
Happy birthday, my Führer.

70
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,074
Central Berlin is being shelled...

71
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,451
from the Brandenburg Gate
to the Reichstag...

72
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,455
- up to Friedrichstrasse Station.
- Where from?

73
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:39,251
- No news yet. Koller's on the line.
- Give him to me.

74
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,673
Koller, do you realize
Berlin is under artillery fire?

75
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,510
- No.
- Don't tell me you can't hear it!

76
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,846
- No, I'm at Werder Game Park.
- Berlin is in uproar!

77
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,392
The Russians have taken
a rail bridge on the Oder.

78
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,144
They've got no railway
batteries near the Oder.

79
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,523
That's not long-range gunfire.

80
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,694
<i>The flak command post
in the Zoo-bunker...</i>

81
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:08,114
claims the guns have a caliber
of just 10 to 12 cm.

82
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,533
The Russian battery
is now in Marzahn.

83
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,661
That's only 12 kilometers
from the city center!

84
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,538
Are the Russians that close?

85
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:19,542
The entire air force command
should be hanged!

86
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,838
Outrageous!
Outrageous!

87
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,174
The Russians are just 12 kilometers
from the city center...

88
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,720
and nobody told me!
I had to ask!

89
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:36,434
Perhaps it's long-range gunfire.
You mentioned a railway battery...

90
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,519
Nonsense!

91
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,446
- Himmler is such a pompous clown!
- Big shots!

92
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,992
Big shots everywhere! It makes me
sick just looking at them!

93
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,080
The Führer is putting "Clausewitz"
into operation today.

94
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:02,752
Berlin as a front-line city...
He won't be able to hold the city.

95
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,757
If he stays, he'll take the Reich
down. We have to talk him out of it.

96
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,760
Speak to Hewel.

97
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,096
He's the only diplomat
who can still influence him.

98
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,016
Believe me, it's no use.

99
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,020
Then talk to your sister-in-law.

100
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,565
Why not? You're married
to Eva Braun's sister...

101
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,152
so you're "related" to the Führer.
We have to try everything.

102
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,654
Berlin is practically
surrounded by the Russians.

103
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,365
You're young.
You'll be a father soon.

104
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,786
- Do you want to die in Berlin?
- Certainly not.

105
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,585
Gentlemen, the Führer!

106
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:59,391
<i>Everything out, and quick!
We're leaving in two hours.</i>

107
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,278
- What's going on?
- We're leaving. Haven't you heard?

108
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,697
"Clausewitz" is in effect.

109
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,743
All government departments and
Wehrmacht offices will leave Berlin.

110
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,705
Who's going to feed
the civilians and soldiers?

111
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,416
Don't ask me, Professor.

112
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,502
This is insane!

113
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,230
Ah, Professor!

114
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,068
- I won't let my staff be evacuated!
- Is that so?

115
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,654
The food supply to Berlin
will collapse!

116
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:57,116
- A good soldier always finds food!
- Sure!

117
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:02,329
And when fighting begins, who will
he take food from? Civilians!

118
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,457
- I cannot permit it!
- The Führer orders!

119
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,754
As the department head,
I answer to the SS and to Himmler!

120
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,759
But as a doctor I belong to the
Wehrmacht, and we are still here!

121
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,470
Please bear that in mind!

122
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,271
The professor can stay in Berlin!
Give him an authorized permit!

123
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,109
Move out!

124
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,167
Everything for Germany.
Heil, my Führer!

125
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,130
My Führer, I...
Heil, my Führer!

126
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,634
They can hardly wait to get away.

127
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,303
I hate those two-faced sods
who say "Sieg Heil"...

128
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,432
but behind their backs say,
"Go fu... screw yourselves".

129
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,604
My Führer...

130
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,650
I beg you to leave Berlin.
It's not too late.

131
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,027
Too late?

132
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,322
Come here, Hewel.

133
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,327
Hewel, you also feel we should
get in touch with the Allies...

134
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,829
and use politics.

135
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,416
Yes, indeed.
We should use politics.

136
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,671
Politics? No more politics!

137
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,174
I'm sick of politics!

138
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,679
When I'm dead, you'll have
enough politics to deal with!

139
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:46,183
- My Führer...
- It's okay, my dear Himmler.

140
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,770
My loyal Heinrich.

141
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,358
It's okay. Go now.

142
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,338
- Between us, I'd say he's had it.
- Yeah?

143
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,384
What do you expect from a teetotal,
non-smoking vegetarian?

144
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,471
Be serious. I'll have to take it
into my own hands.

145
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,599
Berlin will fall
in the next few days.

146
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:32,604
Once the Führer is dead,
who will the Allies negotiate with?

147
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:36,108
What makes you so sure
they'll negotiate?

148
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,029
They need the Nazi state and my SS
to keep order after the war.

149
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,532
Give me an hour with
Eisenhower and he'll agree.

150
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:48,245
- We're already in touch.
- Be careful, that's treason.

151
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,040
Fegelein, I have other worries.

152
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,378
Should I give Eisenhower
the Nazi salute or shake his hand?

153
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,053
Well, well...

154
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,266
the later it gets,
the nicer the guests.

155
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:14,396
Gentlemen, are you leaving already?
I wanted to talk to you.

156
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,402
- The Führer orders to destroy all...
- I really must go.

157
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,447
Drop in to visit me
at Hohenlychen sometime.

158
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:31,080
My staff and I are heading north
to support the battle for Berlin.

159
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,174
<i>So, Speer...</i>

160
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,303
the bombing raids on our cities
have a positive side too.

161
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:51,809
It's much easier to remove debris
than to tear everything down.

162
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:56,980
Once we win the war, reconstruction
will be completed very quickly.

163
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,987
How many thousands of hours have we
spent on these magnificent models?

164
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,326
You're a true genius, Speer.

165
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,245
Yes, you are.

166
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,707
Only you and I realize
that a Third Reich isn't possible...

167
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,585
if it only consists of
department stores and factories...

168
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,005
skyscrapers and hotels.

169
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,343
This Third Reich will be a
treasure house of art and culture...

170
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,721
that will survive the millennia.

171
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:35,227
We see before us
the ancient cities, the acropolis...

172
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,814
we see medieval cities
with their cathedrals...

173
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,609
and we know that people
need something like this, a center.

174
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,408
Yes, Speer...

175
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,745
that was my vision...

176
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,416
and it still is.

177
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:05,048
My Führer, if you want to realize
this plan, you should leave Berlin.

178
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:14,641
- Say something, Eva.
- He's the Führer.

179
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,271
- He knows what's right.
- Please leave Berlin.

180
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,399
The Russians have
nearly cut us off.

181
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,068
I can't do that, child.

182
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:30,657
I'd feel like a Lama priest
spinning an empty prayer-wheel.

183
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:36,330
I must force an outcome in Berlin,
or face my downfall.

184
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,209
Speer...

185
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,338
What do you say?

186
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,133
You must be on stage
when the curtain falls.

187
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,563
Reload!

188
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,748
Leave me alone!

189
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:24,461
How old are you? 12? And you? 14?

190
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,589
And you? Do you want to play war?
Go home, play another game!

191
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,882
Who are you?

192
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,219
- What do you want?
- My son... alive.

193
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,639
You should be proud of him.
He destroyed two tanks. Today.

194
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,267
The Führer is giving him a medal.

195
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,646
You're young.
On which front did you fight?

196
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,232
I haven't had the honor yet.

197
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:50,737
You're lucky you haven't seen a
battle yet. Send the children home.

198
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,657
We will fight
to the very last man.

199
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,536
What are you defending?
This is nothing but a trap.

200
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,665
The Russians will attack from
both sides, so there's no escape.

201
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,175
- We'll shoot back at them!
- With what?

202
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,087
We're using flak as artillery.

203
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:11,258
The Russians are coming, several
armies with tanks, heavy artillery.

204
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,637
You really believe you can hold off
their assault for even five minutes?

205
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,141
We made our pledge to the Führer.

206
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,811
Don't you understand?
We've lost the war! It's over!

207
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,688
Coward!

208
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,695
Get outta here! Now!

209
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:36,658
When the Russians come and
You're still here, you'll all die!

210
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,457
I may be repeating myself,
but the 9th Army must retreat.

211
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:48,837
- Otherwise, it will be wiped out.
- The 9th Army will not retreat!

212
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,673
Tell Busse to fight
where he stands.

213
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,718
In that case,
the 9th Army is lost.

214
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,304
We will drive back
the Soviet units...

215
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,141
in the north and east...

216
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,354
with a relentless
and almighty assault.

217
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,856
With which units?

218
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,736
Steiner's division will attack from
the north and unite with the 9th.

219
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,699
The 9th Army
is unable to move north.

220
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,494
The enemy outnumbers us 10 to 1.

221
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,997
Have Wenck support them
with the 12th Army.

222
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,209
But the 12th Army
is marching west, to the Elbe.

223
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,711
Then tell them to turn around!

224
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:35,592
- That'd expose the Western front.
- Are you questioning my orders?

225
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,346
I believe I've made myself
perfectly clear!

226
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,601
The western Allies will realize that
only we can hold off the Bolsheviks.

227
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,354
We're the last bulwark
against the Asian hordes.

228
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:51,483
We hold Berlin for a few more clays,
we make a deal with the Americans.

229
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,256
Ah, Mohnke, you're here.

230
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,383
My Führer.

231
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,386
I put "Clausewitz" into
effect today.

232
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,513
Berlin is now a front-line city.

233
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:26,268
You're in charge of defending
the government district.

234
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,189
If there's a battle in Berlin,
we'll fight to the last man.

235
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:35,402
But there are over three millions
civilians. They must be evacuated.

236
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,574
I appreciate your concern, Mohnke.

237
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,244
But we have to be cold-blooded.

238
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,831
We can't worry about
these so-called civilians now!

239
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:53,587
With all due respect, what will
become of the women and children...

240
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,714
the thousands of wounded
and the elderly?

241
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,303
In a war like this
there are no civilians.

242
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,598
The Führer has lost
all sense of reality.

243
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,851
He moves divisions
that only exist on his map.

244
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,229
Steiner's scattered unit
can hardly defend itself.

245
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,691
- He wants it to attack. It's insane!
- Tell him yourself.

246
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:19,112
- He wouldn't listen. You know that.
- Something has to be done.

247
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,698
Are you crazy? He'd kick
us out like Rundstedt and Guderian.

248
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,700
SO what?

249
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,122
We're soldiers! We pledged
our allegiance to the Führer!

250
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,249
Should that prevent us
from thinking?

251
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,295
Look who's talking! An opportunist!
A ruthless careerist!

252
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,380
Pardon?

253
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,282
- Where were you?
- None of your damned business!

254
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:17,295
My Fuhrer, Berlin Hitler Youth's
most successful tank hunters.

255
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm proud of you all.

256
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,772
My Führer, this boy alone
destroyed two tanks with a bazooka.

257
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,066
His name is Peter Kranz.

258
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,570
So your name is Peter.

259
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,658
I wish my generals
had your courage.

260
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,212
Fine, fine.

261
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,428
History will take note of you.

262
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:11,349
And when Germania rises up
from these ruins...

263
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,561
you'll be the heroes.

264
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,690
Heil to you!

265
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:51,389
I don't know, this gives me
the creeps. I prefer bombing raids.

266
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,475
What will happen to us?

267
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,479
Yesterday, he told me
it was all right if I left.

268
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:02,400
Everyone's deserting him.
We can't just get up and leave.

269
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,611
I can't either.

270
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,286
I've no idea where I should go.

271
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,791
My parents and friends
back home warned me.

272
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,544
They told me not to get
involved with the Nazis.

273
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:25,173
Should I go back and say,
"I'm home. I made a mistake.

274
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,634
When things got bad,
I realized my mistake".

275
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,056
Life will go on, somehow.

276
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:44,067
- What do you think, Colonel?
- We should go.

277
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,405
Where to?

278
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,658
I don't know.
Someplace where we're needed.

279
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,507
Come upstairs, everyone!
We're going to have a party!

280
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,342
Come on!

281
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,097
Come on, kids!

282
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,356
I want us to have some fun today.

283
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:33,700
No matter where the enemy goes, he
has to find nothing but wasteland.

284
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,247
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

285
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,501
No electricity, no gas, no clean
water, no coal, no transportation.

286
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,463
By destroying all our railways,
canals, clocks, ships, locomotives...

287
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:50,717
we would hurl Germany
back to the Middle Ages.

288
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,096
You'd be robbing our people
of every chance to survive.

289
00:25:55,263 --> 00:26:00,101
If the war is lost, it's immaterial
if the people perish too.

290
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,728
It is not necessary to consider...

291
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,775
the German people's
survival needs.

292
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,278
On the contrary, it is better
to destroy those things ourselves.

293
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,614
They have proved
themselves too weak...

294
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:16,743
and it is a law of nature
that they will be exterminated.

295
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,288
They are your people.
You are the Führer.

296
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,794
The only ones who will survive
the battle are the inferior ones.

297
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,671
Our best people
have fallen already.

298
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,179
Here you go.

299
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,265
Oh, come on, you're
supposed to dance.

300
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,770
- Shall I have this dance, lady?
- With pleasure.

301
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,589
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

302
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,217
What's the matter?

303
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,558
Convince him that
we have to leave Berlin, Eva!

304
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,815
Or come with me.

305
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,736
Eva!

306
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,242
You're going to die.

307
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:02,640
Put on the music!
I want to dance!

308
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,143
DEUCE!

309
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,690
- Anything in particular?
- Swing.

310
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,638
Traudl...

311
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,682
Traudl...

312
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,145
It's all so unreal...

313
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:55,193
like a dream where you want
to wake up, but you can't.

314
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,154
It keeps going on and on...

315
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:05,328
Gerda, I feel sick...

316
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,615
Come on!

317
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,827
Come on!

318
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:03,219
I haven't moved my command...

319
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:08,725
I haven't moved my command post!

320
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,228
To the west?

321
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,398
- I'm 1,000 meters from the enemy!
- General!

322
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,664
Hello? Hello!

323
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,004
The report, General?

324
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,507
- I'm to be shot.
- What? What for?

325
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:46,637
They claim that I moved my command
post westward, away from the enemy.

326
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,432
Not a bad idea.

327
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,268
Come with me.

328
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,035
- Schenck.
<i>- Mohnke.</i>

329
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:14,415
I'm at the chancellery bunker
defending the government district.

330
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,584
<i>I need your help.</i>

331
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,295
That's difficult,
everyone's been evacuated.

332
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,881
Everyone's gone
except me and my adjutant.

333
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,342
- You're a doctor?
- Yes. Internist.

334
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:28,846
Find a vehicle and bring us
all the morphine, penicillin...

335
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,599
and first-aid supplies
you can find!

336
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,062
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, and hurry.

337
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,281
I have to see the Führer.

338
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,243
- What for?
- I'm to be shot.

339
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,125
Wait here.

340
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,544
Your guns, please.

341
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,802
Not here.

342
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,058
Guard post 2.
Rogen

343
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,396
General...

344
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,400
Not you.

345
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,797
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

346
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:30,092
What's going on?
Why am I to be shot?

347
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:35,056
You know the Führer has forbidden
any westward retreat.

348
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,810
Officers who disobey are to be
arrested and shot on the spot.

349
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:44,106
What do you mean? My units
have been in fierce battle for clays!

350
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:48,611
My command post is just
one kilometer from the front line.

351
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,447
Go on.

352
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:56,202
You see this, don't you?
Don't use that tone with me!

353
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,206
Now do what you have to do!

354
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:05,253
I think you should explain it
to the Fuhrer yourself. Come along.

355
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,103
- I can't let you through.
- I'm here on orders from Mohnke.

356
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,692
We need first-aid material
from the military hospital.

357
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,070
It's empty. They all left.

358
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,698
- And the wounded?
- How should I know?

359
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,608
- I'll have a look.
- Colonel!

360
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:39,078
- Stay here!
- Careful you don't get killed.

361
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,497
There are Russians everywhere.

362
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,374
See that?

363
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,252
It's the end of the Reich.
That's Russki territory!

364
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,725
May I?

365
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:11,068
He's so damn stubborn.
Why didn't he let me do it?

366
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,511
Hello?

367
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,800
I should be with my troops.
Are you sure the Führer needs me?

368
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,345
- Drink up!
- The Führer orders!

369
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:25,309
- You really impressed the Führer.
- You don't think Steiner will attack?

370
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,728
I doubt that Steiner's units
are able to attack...

371
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:31,816
but why am I telling you this?
You know better than I do.

372
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,820
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin will be lost.

373
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:48,374
Congratulations, your report
really impressed the Führer.

374
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:52,378
He has appointed you
commander of Berlin's defense.

375
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:57,591
I'd rather have been shot
than have this honor.

376
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,452
Tank alarm!

377
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,624
Stay calm. They're too far away
to do anything.

378
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,727
Out of the way, please, ladies.

379
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,676
- Is that German artillery out there?
- I'm afraid not.

380
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,472
But Steiner's attack
should be underway by now!

381
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,268
You have to leave.
There isn't much time.

382
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:37,149
But the Führer believes Steiner's
attack will improve the situation.

383
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:40,694
I heard him say that Steiner's
assault will turn things around.

384
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,490
All the Führer advisors
know that's absurd!

385
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,660
I'd not be surprised
if he thinks so too.

386
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:50,454
Why would he deceive us?

387
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,456
What does he have to lose?

388
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,501
I don't believe a word of it!

389
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,338
The enemy has broken through
along a wide front.

390
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,259
They've taken Zossen to the south
and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

391
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:07,304
They're on the northern outskirts
between Frohnau and Pankow.

392
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:12,184
They've reached Lichtenberg,
Mahlsdorf, Karlshorst to the east.

393
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,689
Steiner's assault will
bring it under control.

394
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,278
My Führer...

395
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,197
Steiner...

396
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:29,201
Steiner couldn't mobilize
enough men.

397
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,246
He wasn't able
to carry out his assault.

398
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:54,226
These men will stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

399
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,701
That was an order!

400
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:14,330
Steiner's assault was an order!

401
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:20,044
Who do you think you are to dare
disobey an order that I give?

402
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:27,051
The military has been lying to me.

403
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,262
Everybody has been lying to me.
Even the SS!

404
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:36,060
Our generals are just a bunch
of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

405
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,520
I can't permit you
to insult the soldiers...

406
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,815
They are cowards,
traitors and failures!

407
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,360
My Führer, this is outrageous!

408
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,364
Our generals are the scum
of the German people!

409
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,241
Not a shred of honor!

410
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:56,288
They call themselves generals!
Years at military academy...

411
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,333
just to learn how to hold
a knife and fork!

412
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,629
For years, the military
has hindered my plans!

413
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,635
They've put every kind
of obstacle in my way!

414
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:13,263
What I should have clone...

415
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:18,310
is liquidate all the high-ranking
officers, as Stalin did!

416
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:25,609
I never attended an academy...

417
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,779
and yet I have conquered Europe...

418
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,491
all by myself!

419
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,414
Traitors!

420
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,083
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the very beginning!

421
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,550
What a monstrous betrayal
of the German people.

422
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:53,637
But all those traitors will pay.
They'll pay with their own blood.

423
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:59,727
They shall drown
in their own blood!

424
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,230
Gerda, please calm yourself.

425
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:13,991
My orders have fallen
on deaf ears.

426
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,122
Under these circumstances,
I am no longer able to lead.

427
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,417
It's over.

428
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,632
The war is lost.

429
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:42,186
But if you believe I'll leave
Berlin, you are seriously mistaken.

430
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,564
I'd rather blow my brains out.

431
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,196
Do whatever you like.

432
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:16,220
The Führer didn't really mean
he'd shoot himself.

433
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,640
<i>Frau</i> Junge and <i>Frau</i> Christian...

434
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,481
get changed. A plane is leaving
in an hour. It will take you south.

435
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,401
Everything is lost...

436
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,154
hopelessly lost.

437
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,453
You know I'll stay with you.
I won't let you send me away.

438
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,801
I'm staying too!

439
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,660
What now?

440
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,662
It's time to end this spectacle.

441
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:29,209
What? You want to give up?
That's unthinkable.

442
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:33,255
The Führer said we won't surrender.
We won't repeat November 1918.

443
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,300
- Never!
- You heard. He'll no longer lead us.

444
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:41,597
- He said, "Do whatever you want".
- The Führer is the Führer!

445
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:45,309
He'll pull himself together.

446
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,604
Great.
And what happens then?

447
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:54,375
We can never surrender.
The Führer would never approve.

448
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:58,071
- We swore to obey his will.
- Nothing but empty phrases!

449
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:01,325
We have to do something
before it's too late.

450
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,619
- You want to save your own skin.
- Stop it!

451
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:15,172
Damn it!

452
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:23,597
We'll never get out alive.
It's all over.

453
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:25,557
Just wait.

454
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:29,353
But the Führer is uncertain.
What if he kills himself?

455
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:34,775
Günsche said there's a tunnel under
the Russian lines to the Yanks.

456
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:41,114
- Why'd you say you'd stay with him?
- I don't know... honestly.

457
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,329
They've stopped. Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

458
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,706
Traudl...

459
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:32,416
Look.

460
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:58,233
Hey, girls, I need a cigarette.

461
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:18,420
Let's go back down again.

462
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:50,410
Where did they come from?

463
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,687
New Volkssturm recruits!
Assigned this afternoon!

464
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:56,166
Tell them to get out
of the line of fire!

465
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:03,590
These recruits are under
Dr. Goebbels' command!

466
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,014
I want them out of there,
right away!

467
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,766
I'll answer for it.

468
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:27,531
- I'm not sure it's the right way.
- Oh, splendid.

469
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:31,284
Stop! Lights out!

470
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:35,831
Stop. Don't move. Don't move.

471
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,375
Lucky! Germans.

472
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:44,089
Help! They want to kill us!

473
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,509
- What's going on here?
- They're MPs.

474
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,553
I don't believe it!

475
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:03,400
Stop it! Let those men go!

476
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,736
- What's going on here?
- It's none of your business!

477
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,614
We found these deserters
in their homes.

478
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,117
They'll be shot,
like every traitor.

479
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:15,834
They're old men, civilians.
You can't do that!

480
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,081
No?

481
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:23,587
Who's going to stop me? You?

482
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,382
That's enough.

483
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,273
Move out!

484
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,087
Here's a doctor.

485
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,139
- Can you operate?
- Not really.

486
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:44,477
Tell Ilse that the children
can't take too many toys.

487
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,313
One toy per child.

488
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:51,526
- And no unnecessary nightclothes.
- Minister Goebbels...

489
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:56,740
My wife and children are coming.
Please take care of them.

490
00:51:57,115 --> 00:52:00,160
Thank you. Brigadeführer,
what can I do for you?

491
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:04,205
The Russians are mowing down
your Volkssturm recruits.

492
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:07,042
They lack experience
and suitable weapons.

493
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:12,505
That is compensated for by their
fervent belief in the final victory.

494
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:17,427
If you can't arm these men,
they can't fight.

495
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,721
They are dying in vain.

496
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,766
I feel no sympathy.

497
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:29,522
I repeat, I feel no sympathy!
The German people chose their fate.

498
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,151
That may surprise some people.

499
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:36,571
Don't fool yourself.
We didn't force the German people.

500
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:42,285
They gave us the mandate. And now
their little throats are being cut.

501
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:55,907
Yes?

502
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,386
<i>Hello?</i>

503
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,262
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

504
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:03,139
- Hermann!
<i>- Don't be stupid.</i>

505
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:04,857
It's a matter of life and death.

506
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,519
How can you say such a thing?
Where are you?

507
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,563
I've decided not to die in Berlin.

508
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,608
Hermann, does my sister
know where you are?

509
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,528
I have to call you back.

510
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:21,116
Hi there, kids.
Your room's on the right.

511
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:24,828
Wait for me.

512
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,374
- Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Nice to see you, Frau Junge.

513
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:43,847
Come on now, get in line!

514
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:46,599
Come here, Helga. Get in line.

515
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,395
We'll put on our best clothes...

516
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,522
and then you can say hello
to Uncle Hitler.

517
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,275
Yes! Yes! Yes!

518
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:59,404
- Remember your song?
- Yes.

519
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:04,117
<i>No land is more beautiful</i>

520
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:10,123
<i>Far and wide</i>

521
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:16,129
<i>Than the land</i>

522
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:20,425
<i>We call our own</i>

523
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:26,598
<i>Than the land</i>

524
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:31,603
<i>We call our own</i>

525
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:42,280
If you want to be certain,
shoot the gun into your mouth.

526
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,450
Your skull will explode.

527
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:50,413
You don't notice a thing.
You die immediately.

528
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,500
I want to look nice when I'm dead.
I'll take poison.

529
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:57,378
If I'm going to die heroically,
I don't want to feel any pain.

530
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,339
That's a sure-fire way.

531
00:54:59,756 --> 00:55:04,219
It paralyzes the nerves
and the respiratory system.

532
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,679
You die within seconds.

533
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:11,309
- Could I have one too?
- Me too.

534
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,736
Thank goodness
Himmler left me well supplied.

535
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,297
Thank you.

536
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:48,471
I'm so sorry I can't give you
a better present.

537
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:59,732
<i>"Berlin, April 23, 1945.</i>

538
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,196
<i>My dearest sister...</i>

539
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,575
<i>I'm so sorry
I have to write you this...</i>

540
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,492
<i>but there's nothing we can do.</i>

541
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:13,454
<i>At any minute,
it could all be over.</i>

542
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:16,874
<i>You should know
that Hermann isn't here.</i>

543
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,212
<i>But I truly believe
you 'II see him again.</i>

544
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:27,385
<i>I'm sure he'll continue the fight
in Bavaria for a certain time.</i>

545
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,514
<i>The Führer has lost all belief
in a favorable outcome."</i>

546
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,769
<i>"My beloved son, I don't know
if this letter will reach you.</i>

547
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:39,229
<i>Perhaps there is
some human soul...</i>

548
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,233
<i>who will pass on
my final words to you.</i>

549
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:46,404
<i>I've stayed with Papa
against his will.</i>

550
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:50,491
<i>Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me leave.</i>

551
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:53,536
<i>You know your mother well.
We have the same blood.</i>

552
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:58,416
<i>I had no second thoughts.
Our magnificent idea has died...</i>

553
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,335
<i>along with every
beautiful, noble...</i>

554
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:03,421
<i>admirable, good thing
I ever known.</i>

555
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:06,716
<i>The world after the Führer? death
and after National Socialism...</i>

556
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:11,471
<i>is no longer worth living in.
That's why the children are here.</i>

557
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:14,098
<i>They are too good
for what will come.</i>

558
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:20,271
<i>merciful God will understand me
for giving them redemption."</i>

559
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,487
<i>"I'll wear the golden bracelet...</i>

560
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:31,074
<i>with the green stone
until the very end.</i>

561
00:57:31,783 --> 00:57:34,619
<i>Then it may be taken from me,
and you shall wear it...</i>

562
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,039
<i>just as I have always worn it.</i>

563
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:42,293
<i>I'm afraid I sent
my diamond watch to the jeweler's.</i>

564
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:44,170
<i>I wrote the address at the bottom.</i>

565
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:47,340
<i>If you're lucky,
you can get it back.</i>

566
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,801
<i>I want you to have it.</i>

567
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,637
<i>You'll also get
the diamond bracelet...</i>

568
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,555
<i>and the topaz pendant...</i>

569
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:58,267
<i>which the Führer gave me
for my birthday.</i>

570
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:03,064
<i>The bill I'm including for
Heise & Co. hasn't been paid yet.</i>

571
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,440
<i>You might receive other bills...</i>

572
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:09,362
<i>but not for more than
1,500 Reichsmarks.</i>

573
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:14,408
<i>Please burn all private
and business letters...</i>

574
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,328
<i>to the Führer at once.</i>

575
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:22,375
<i>I'm also sending you
food and cigarettes.</i>

576
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:26,087
<i>Please give Lindners and Kargels
some of the coffee.</i>

577
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:29,716
<i>The cigarettes are for Mandi.
The tobacco is for Papa.</i>

578
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:31,676
<i>The chocolate is for Mom.</i>

579
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:36,723
<i>That's all I can tell you.
It's enough for now.</i>

580
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:41,686
<i>I wish you the best of luck,
my dearest sister.</i>

581
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,312
<i>And remember...</i>

582
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:45,648
<i>I'm sure you'll see Hermann again.</i>

583
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:48,443
<i>Best regards and kisses.</i>

584
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:50,403
<i>I remain...</i>

585
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,822
<i>your sister."</i>

586
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,583
Inge!

587
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,461
Inge!

588
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:40,221
Listen, Keitel,
I want you to leave tonight.

589
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:45,101
Make your way to Dönitz.
Help him organize everything.

590
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:48,437
We have to get
things moving again.

591
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,066
I don't understand.

592
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:56,279
It's a disaster.
We have no more oilfields.

593
01:00:56,487 --> 01:01:01,534
It's impossible to carry out
far-ranging operations.

594
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,789
Once I've managed this situation,
we must recover the oilfields.

595
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:15,840
Any more questions?

596
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:20,803
- No, my Führer.
- Fine. Have a nice trip.

597
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:52,561
"My Führer, following your
decision to stay in Berlin...

598
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:55,480
do you approve me
as Vice Chancellor...

599
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,149
to take charge
of the entire Reich...

600
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,736
with the necessary power
and authority?

601
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:04,073
If I receive no answer
by 10 PM...

602
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,076
I will assume that you
have been incapacitated.

603
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,662
I will serve the well-being
of our people and Fatherland."

604
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,792
He's betraying Germany and you!

605
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,420
Göring's concern
isn't unjustified.

606
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:22,425
If our communication system breaks
down, which could happen any time...

607
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:27,638
we'd be cut off from the world.
We could no longer pass on orders.

608
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:30,808
I see it differently.
Göring wants to seize power.

609
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:34,728
I never trusted that mob
he gathered at Obersalzberg.

610
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,188
It stinks of a coup.

611
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:41,610
That failure! That bloodsucker!

612
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:44,405
A parvenu! A lazybones!

613
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:50,161
How dare he declare me
unable to act!

614
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:52,455
Hello, Frau Junge.

615
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:57,460
- How did you reach Berlin?
- Wasn't easy. I must see the Führer.

616
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,422
- I'd wait if I were you.
- The air force...

617
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,216
What did he do with it?

618
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:07,678
That's reason enough
to execute him!

619
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:14,060
That morphine addict
helped to corrupt this country.

620
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,437
And now this!

621
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:20,483
He has betrayed me.

622
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,820
Me!

623
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:36,207
I want Goring to be deprived
of power and removed from office.

624
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:39,543
If I don't survive this war...

625
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:43,422
that man is to be
executed at once.

626
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,259
What about us?

627
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,471
Is there any hope?

628
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:55,267
Leave before it's too late.

629
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:59,772
The Führer wants to stay here.
We can't leave him alone.

630
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:06,278
For what awaits the Führer, he won't
need anyone. Least of all you.

631
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,782
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
are staying. The children too.

632
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,586
But the children...

633
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:29,051
I'd always thought that...

634
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:33,305
I thought there was
some way out...

635
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:41,355
Come in.

636
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,235
Albert... hello.

637
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,081
Fever?

638
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:02,585
Albert, my heart can't take it.

639
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:07,298
Why don't you take the children
and get out of here?

640
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,676
But where to?

641
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:16,348
I once told you, I can send
a barge to Schwanenwerder.

642
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:20,561
It can be fixed up as a hideout
until it's all over...

643
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:25,357
- which won't be long.
- I've thought it through carefully.

644
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:32,114
I won't let the children grow up in
a world with no National Socialism.

645
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:37,620
Think it over again, Magda.

646
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:41,373
The children deserve a future.

647
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,839
If the idea of National Socialism
dies, there is no future.

648
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:08,651
I can't believe
you really want this.

649
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,196
Go.

650
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:45,187
Come in.

651
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:52,194
I knew you'd come.

652
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:55,864
You're not one of those
who'd abandon the Führer.

653
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:02,913
I've just come
to say goodbye to the Führer.

654
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,748
I have to return
to Hamburg tonight.

655
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,710
Of course. Take a seat.

656
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:14,633
Look, I brought some of
the furniture you designed for me.

657
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,177
I just couldn't part with it.

658
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:22,558
Come on, help yourself.
I bet you haven't eaten all clay.

659
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,102
You happen to be right.

660
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:28,147
Thanks.

661
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:31,108
It's so important that you came.

662
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:34,194
It shows him you're on his side.

663
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,822
Did he have his doubts?

664
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,827
He's been wondering
if you were possibly against him.

665
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,247
But I kept telling him you'd come.
And now you're here.

666
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:54,673
It pleased him that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

667
01:08:54,882 --> 01:08:57,593
I think it's the right choice, too.

668
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:01,513
You know what?

669
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:06,352
It may be crazy, but...

670
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,772
I'm really happy
to be able to stay.

671
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:13,400
And I'm not afraid.

672
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,369
Yes?

673
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,636
So you've come.

674
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,806
My Führer...

675
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:46,100
It's okay.

676
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:50,187
Let's sit down.

677
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:12,501
I had such big plans
for the Germans and for the world.

678
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:18,841
No one understood me,
not even my oldest comrades.

679
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:28,642
What huge opportunities we had.
The world was within reach.

680
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,481
Too late.

681
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:45,701
What I am proud of is that
I openly confronted the Jews...

682
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:51,290
and I cleansed the German lands
of Jewish poison.

683
01:10:56,044 --> 01:11:01,467
It isn't hard for me to go.
Just that one moment...

684
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:10,267
and then eternal peace.

685
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,733
Spare the German people,
my Führer.

686
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:23,489
If my own people
fail this test...

687
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:27,159
I will shed not one tear for them.

688
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,536
They deserve nothing else.

689
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:34,291
It's their own destiny.
They themselves are to blame.

690
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:43,342
For months...

691
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:47,387
I must tell you this, my Führer...

692
01:11:47,638 --> 01:11:52,226
For months I have not carried out
your orders of destruction.

693
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,855
Documents exist which prove
that I not only ignored...

694
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,566
but even acted
contrary to your orders.

695
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:08,116
I had to tell you.

696
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,545
My personal loyalty to you
never wavered throughout.

697
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:37,104
So, you're leaving.

698
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:41,567
Fine. Goodbye.

699
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:55,289
I wish you all the best.

700
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:21,148
So, gentlemen, eat your fill.

701
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,538
Peter!

702
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:30,717
Everything's okay, my boy.

703
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,568
Fever.

704
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:52,489
Yes, but he's alive.

705
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:19,641
Courage and loyalty still exist.

706
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:24,312
Lord von Greim and Frau Reitsch...

707
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:31,319
I am pleased that you both
arrived uninjured, more or less.

708
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:33,655
Be seated.

709
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,160
We were under heavy fire
but were able to land in Gatow.

710
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:42,289
The roads were impassable, so...

711
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,458
we got a plane...

712
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,710
a Fieseler Storch,
and flew over the Russian lines...

713
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:50,297
landing on the East-West axis,
a few hundred meters from here.

714
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:53,425
Just before landing,
we got hit by Russian artillery.

715
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:56,553
General von Greim...

716
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,307
I appoint you Commander in Chief
of the Air Force...

717
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:03,226
and General Field Marshal.

718
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,021
A great responsibility...

719
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:10,358
rests on your shoulders. You must
shake up the entire air force.

720
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:14,237
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

721
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:19,451
Life never forgives weakness.

722
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:23,789
This so-called humanity...

723
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:27,584
is just priests' drivel.

724
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:33,215
Compassion is a primal sin.
Compassion for the weak...

725
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,801
is a betrayal of nature.

726
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:41,640
The strongest can only be victorious
by eradicating the weak.

727
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:45,352
I have always obeyed
this law of nature...

728
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:49,606
by never permitting myself
to feel compassion.

729
01:16:49,815 --> 01:16:52,651
I have ruthlessly suppressed
domestic opposition...

730
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:08,416
Heil, my Führer.

731
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:15,298
You have requested
to leave Berlin?

732
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,552
As you know, all medical units...

733
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:22,847
and staff under
Himmler's authority...

734
01:17:22,848 --> 01:17:24,516
have left Berlin.

735
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:29,604
Himmler is a traitor. He will
receive the punishment he deserves.

736
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:34,860
As an SS physician,
I have no more duties here.

737
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:39,447
Your application to leave Berlin
is completely unacceptable.

738
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,535
My... family...

739
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:47,706
If the Russians find me here...
I have to leave!

740
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,041
You did nothing wrong.

741
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:53,335
Future generations
will be thankful...

742
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,298
for the medical research you did.

743
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,800
I'll take responsibility
for it all.

744
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,683
Let's discuss this another time.

745
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,367
We can't find
Gruppenführer Fegelein.

746
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:29,331
- He is not in the bunker.
- What do you mean, can't find him?

747
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,082
Then look for him!

748
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,711
I want to see Fegelein at once!

749
01:18:35,086 --> 01:18:39,257
If he's gone AWOL,
it's desertion! Treason!

750
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:44,971
Bring me Fegelein!
Fegelein! Fegelein!

751
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:59,611
Dad, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

752
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:07,786
- Ernst... is something wrong?
- No. Thank you.

753
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,457
Gitte is hungry too.

754
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:18,046
Well, Ilse, now you have
to eat something too.

755
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:22,175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

756
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,348
Thank you.

757
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:25,238
- What's going on?
- You're under arrest.

758
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,741
- What?
- For desertion.

759
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,744
Get dressed.
You must come with us.

760
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,620
Kiss my ass!

761
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:37,083
Come with us.

762
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,670
Let go, you bastard!
You got no right!

763
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:46,176
Please don't let them
kill Hermann.

764
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,803
He wanted to flee,
It's beyond doubt.

765
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:51,806
So what?
It's all over anyway.

766
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:57,145
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant!

767
01:20:57,604 --> 01:21:01,775
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

768
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:06,154
There is no compassion
for traitors.

769
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,783
There is no mercy for traitors.

770
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:15,121
He'll be court-martialed and shot.

771
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:18,541
What good is that now?

772
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:22,337
It is my will!

773
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,650
You're the Führer.

774
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:41,064
Go ahead.

775
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:43,608
The Russians are
breaking through everywhere.

776
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:47,320
There are no reserves left
and air support has stopped.

777
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,073
There's no way
to bring in more ammunition.

778
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:57,247
The Russians have reached
Weidendammer Bridge...

779
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:01,084
Lustgarten to the east,
Potsdammerplatz to the south...

780
01:22:01,251 --> 01:22:05,672
and Tiergarten to the west,
300-400 meters from the Chancellery.

781
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:09,342
- How long can you hold out?
- One or two days at most.

782
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:13,012
- The government district too?
- Yes, my Führer.

783
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:16,808
My Führer, as a soldier,
I suggest we try...

784
01:22:17,142 --> 01:22:21,521
to break through the encirclement.
During the fight for Berlin...

785
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:26,276
We've already lost
15-20,000 of the younger officers.

786
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:29,487
But that's what young men are for.

787
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,075
Your suggestion is absurd! Insane!

788
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,328
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them now.

789
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:42,417
My Führer, the orders are ready.
I give you my word...

790
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:47,422
The Führer can't just disappear from
history like some infamous fugitive!

791
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:51,759
Even if we got out successfully...

792
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:56,181
I'd only be escaping
one trap to fall into another.

793
01:22:56,347 --> 01:23:01,644
I'd have to sleep in the open, or in
a farmhouse or something similar...

794
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,606
and wait for the end to come.

795
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,734
Wenck is approaching
with the 12th Army.

796
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:11,196
He can unite
with Busse's 9th Army...

797
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:15,742
and inflict a crushing blow
on the Russians to save us all.

798
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,786
Wenck is a man of excellence.

799
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:21,748
Telegraph Keitel.

800
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,210
Report to me immediately:

801
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:29,631
First, where are
Wenck's front lines?

802
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:33,218
Second, when are they attacking?

803
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:36,137
Third, where is the 9th Army?

804
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:41,100
Fourth, where will the 9th Army
break through?

805
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:46,773
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be proved right.

806
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:50,026
Wenck will come.

807
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:59,202
Wenck will come.

808
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:15,301
I want to know if it's possible
for Wenck to attack or not.

809
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:20,807
It's unlikely that Wenck's small
force can attack the Red Army.

810
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:23,226
How dare you say it's unlikely?

811
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,812
Wenck has nothing
to confront the Red Army!

812
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:29,107
Why don't you tell the Führer?

813
01:24:29,274 --> 01:24:32,694
- Have you all gone crazy?
- The Führer knows it himself!

814
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:35,697
But he will never surrender!
And we won't either!

815
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:38,533
I went through that before!
And once is enough!

816
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,827
Come on.
I have to get out of here.

817
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:06,728
Heil Hitler!

818
01:25:55,485 --> 01:25:58,321
Sorry, I fell asleep.

819
01:25:58,446 --> 01:26:01,157
So you rested up a bit, dear?

820
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,829
Take it in shorthand.

821
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:15,380
My political testament.

822
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:22,387
Since 1914, when I invested
my modest strength...

823
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:27,183
in the First World War,
which was forced upon the Reich...

824
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:31,062
over 30 years have passed.

825
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:34,064
In those three decades...

826
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:37,151
all my thoughts,
actions and my life...

827
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:42,031
were dictated by my love for
and loyalty to the German people.

828
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,246
- Sorry, but the heavy gunfire...
- You sit there.

829
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:54,419
Centuries will pass...

830
01:26:55,086 --> 01:26:58,589
but from the ruins of our cities
and cultural monuments...

831
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:03,219
our hatred will be renewed
for those who are responsible...

832
01:27:03,428 --> 01:27:08,307
the people to whom
we owe all this:

833
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:12,562
The international Jewry
and its supporters.

834
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:26,451
What's wrong, Herr Minister?

835
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:32,498
Imagine!
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

836
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:35,626
He ordered me to leave.

837
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:41,632
I've never disobeyed
one of the Führer orders. Never!

838
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:55,521
But I will not obey this order.
I will stand by the Führer.

839
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:02,820
I'm sorry, Frau Junge, but...

840
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:06,491
I have to dictate
my personal testament to you.

841
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:12,079
I'm typing the Führer testament.

842
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,749
Fine.

843
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:19,253
I understand.
I'll get back to you.

844
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,094
My Führer, I...

845
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:31,182
The Race Laws require me
to ask you this.

846
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:34,101
My Führer, are you
of pure Aryan descent?

847
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:41,692
- Yes.
- May I see your ID?

848
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:46,113
- You're talking to the Führer.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:49,283
And are you, Frau Braun,
of pure Aryan descent?

850
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:50,451
YES.

851
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:53,579
Then the matter is...
there are no obstacles.

852
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:58,042
I ask you: do you,
my Führer Adolf Hitler...

853
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:03,130
take Eva Braun to be
your lawful wedded wife?

854
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,341
I do.

855
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:09,345
Do you, Eva Braun,
take the Führer Adolf Hitler...

856
01:29:09,554 --> 01:29:14,058
- to be your lawful wedded husband?
- I do.

857
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:18,104
I hereby declare you man and wife.

858
01:29:57,518 --> 01:30:00,187
I need two men!

859
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:03,482
You'll be okay.

860
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:08,279
- The Führer wants to see you now.
- At this hour?

861
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:31,802
- How long can you hold out?
- Perhaps 20 hours. No longer.

862
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:35,640
The Russians are just
a few hundred meters away.

863
01:30:36,349 --> 01:30:39,185
For the moment,
we've stopped them.

864
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:45,066
Know what, Mohnke? The Western
democracies are decadent.

865
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:50,196
They will be defeated by those
disciplined people of the East.

866
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:56,410
All the best.
Thank you.

867
01:30:56,702 --> 01:31:00,623
It wasn’t only for Germany.

868
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:22,561
Keitel's report.

869
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:28,734
"First, Wenck is stuck
south of Lake Schwielow.

870
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,738
Second, the 12th Army cannot
continue its assault on Berlin.

871
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:38,285
Third, the bulk of the
9th Army is encircled."

872
01:31:57,513 --> 01:32:02,727
My Führer, we need instructions
in case we run out of ammunition.

873
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:07,606
I will never surrender.
Never.

874
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:11,110
I forbid you to surrender.

875
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:14,280
That goes for every other
commander as well.

876
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,626
Listen, Günsche.

877
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:33,340
Frau Braun...
My wife and I will commit suicide.

878
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:36,469
But I don't want the Russians
to exhibit my body in some museum.

879
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:40,181
Don't let me fall into their hands,
dead or alive!

880
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:45,603
I want my body to be burned
so it can never be found.

881
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,776
Günsche, promise you will make
all necessary arrangements...

882
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:57,281
for the disposal
of my mortal remains.

883
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:00,576
My Führer...

884
01:33:00,785 --> 01:33:05,039
this is a terrible order,
but I will carry it out.

885
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:33,776
- Kempka.
- Erich, I need...

886
01:33:34,068 --> 01:33:35,736
- 200 liters of gasoline.
<i>- What?</i>

887
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:38,239
Are you crazy?
Where do I get that much gasoline?

888
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,200
From the parked vehicles.
No one needs them now.

889
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:44,662
- Why do you need so much gas?
- I can't tell you on the phone.

890
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:03,347
Come with me, please.

891
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:06,267
The Führer wants to see us.

892
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:17,027
Should I tell him you can't come?

893
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:21,115
It's my pneumothorax.

894
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:25,452
I won't last much longer anyway.

895
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:13,042
Excuse me, Madam.

896
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,723
This way, Professor.

897
01:35:36,357 --> 01:35:38,651
Please wait here.

898
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:50,162
Excuse me...

899
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:26,991
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

900
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:32,329
My Führer, preserve our belief
in the final victory!

901
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:37,584
Lead us and we will follow you!

902
01:36:40,462 --> 01:36:42,131
Come on.

903
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,725
Come in and join us!

904
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:56,061
Here, have a drink.

905
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:01,608
- Drinking is all we have left.
- Have a seat.

906
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:03,610
That's better.

907
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:09,199
Yes sir, our situation is hopeless.
It's what you call shitty!

908
01:37:13,037 --> 01:37:15,497
- Be seated.
- We are honored, Fräulein...

909
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:20,252
- Frau...
- You may call me Frau Hitler.

910
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:26,050
Don't worry, it's all right.

911
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:32,806
- Pity we can't go outside anymore.
- Only if you want a hero's death.

912
01:37:33,766 --> 01:37:39,521
- Fritz, pull yourself together!
- Yes, sir! Pull myself together!

913
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:42,775
Duck!

914
01:37:53,202 --> 01:37:55,662
That was a close call.

915
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,669
Heil Hitler!

916
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:07,049
- Obersturmbannführer, what's up?
- I must report to the Führer.

917
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:09,676
Not now. Have a seat.

918
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:12,471
Sit down, drink up.

919
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:19,228
May I introduce you
to Frau Hitler?

920
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:24,024
So young and so many medals!
You must be proud of yourself.

921
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:29,279
I must go.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

922
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:33,659
You can use our toilet.
Go ahead.

923
01:38:40,124 --> 01:38:45,587
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only destroy the optic nerve.

924
01:38:45,796 --> 01:38:51,093
That's why it's advisable
to take poison too.

925
01:38:51,593 --> 01:38:56,265
Pull the trigger the moment
you bite the capsule.

926
01:38:56,473 --> 01:38:59,017
Will I have enough time to do it?

927
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:02,479
The poison takes effect
after one or two seconds.

928
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:22,249
Körner, you too.

929
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:07,002
Frau Junge, I've known him...

930
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:10,756
my husband... for over 15 years.

931
01:40:11,173 --> 01:40:15,761
But when I think about it,
I don't know anything about him.

932
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:18,764
Although he likes to talk.

933
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:26,647
I was looking forward to Berlin.
But he's changed so much.

934
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:30,234
He only talks about clogs
and vegetarian meals.

935
01:40:30,776 --> 01:40:33,403
I really hate Blondi.

936
01:40:35,322 --> 01:40:40,786
Sometimes I kick her secretly, then
Adolf wonders about her behavior.

937
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:54,424
It seems he doesn't want
anyone to see inside him.

938
01:40:54,675 --> 01:40:58,470
I mean deep inside.
In private...

939
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,267
he can be such a caring person.

940
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:08,188
But then he says...
such brutal things.

941
01:41:08,814 --> 01:41:12,067
When he's the Führer.

942
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:16,238
Come on, let's have a smoke.

943
01:41:37,676 --> 01:41:39,636
I'm sorry.

944
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:45,434
You've so many worries
and I sit here whining.

945
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,355
Frau Junge, let me give you
this coat as a going-away present.

946
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:53,317
I love well-dressed women.

947
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:56,445
I want you to have it
and to enjoy it.

948
01:41:57,070 --> 01:42:00,407
What a surprise.
Thank you.

949
01:42:00,824 --> 01:42:04,578
I have no idea where
and when I could wear it.

950
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:10,542
Please...
try to get out of here.

951
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:13,712
Promise me.

952
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:46,805
Thank you, that was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

953
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:12,706
The time has come.
It's over now.

954
01:44:50,494 --> 01:44:53,288
The Führer wants to say farewell.

955
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:28,281
You're the bravest mother
in the whole Reich.

956
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:33,703
My Führer, you've made me
the happiest woman in Germany.

957
01:45:57,102 --> 01:45:59,646
Give my regards to Bavaria.

958
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:27,507
- Why are you here?
- To see Aunt Eva and Uncle Hitler.

959
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:33,096
- Have you had anything to eat?
- Just breakfast.

960
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:36,224
I'll get you something to eat
and be right back, okay?

961
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:38,602
Okay.

962
01:46:48,695 --> 01:46:51,615
Comrades, have you heard
the latest news from outside?

963
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,075
Berlin's a city of warehouses.

964
01:46:54,242 --> 01:46:57,579
"Where's my house?
Where's my house?"

965
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,711
Herr Günsche,
I have to see the Führer.

966
01:47:06,212 --> 01:47:07,631
Please!

967
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:10,675
The Führer does not want
to be disturbed by anyone.

968
01:47:11,343 --> 01:47:14,429
Please, Günsche.
Just one moment.

969
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,432
Please!

970
01:47:23,688 --> 01:47:26,816
My Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.

971
01:47:32,656 --> 01:47:33,698
What now?

972
01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:38,662
My Führer, I beg you,
leave Berlin!

973
01:47:39,371 --> 01:47:43,249
My Führer, please,
Don't leave us!

974
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:46,086
What will become of us?

975
01:47:49,089 --> 01:47:52,634
Tomorrow, millions of people
will curse me...

976
01:47:52,759 --> 01:47:56,471
but fate has taken its course.

977
01:47:59,099 --> 01:48:03,144
Get up.
Come on.

978
01:48:04,104 --> 01:48:06,272
Come on.

979
01:48:14,364 --> 01:48:17,242
Aunt Traudl,
I really like those loud booms!

980
01:48:17,367 --> 01:48:22,455
- Why?
- Nothing can harm us here, right?

981
01:48:22,622 --> 01:48:24,040
You're right.

982
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:34,634
Bullseye!

983
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:01,536
Herr Reichsleiter,
it has happened.

984
01:49:20,597 --> 01:49:23,224
The Führer is dead.

985
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,117
There's Papa.

986
01:49:52,337 --> 01:49:56,466
Are you crazy?
That gasoline has caused...

987
01:49:56,633 --> 01:49:59,344
Be quiet, Erich.

988
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:11,606
Step back!

989
01:50:24,077 --> 01:50:27,372
Come on! Come on!

990
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:57,587
No! Don't!

991
01:52:01,382 --> 01:52:04,719
Let go of Grandma!

992
01:52:10,058 --> 01:52:15,188
Order... Order...

993
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:18,691
Order must be restored!

994
01:52:26,366 --> 01:52:28,743
Go after those two!

995
01:52:32,205 --> 01:52:33,998
Here, this way!

996
01:52:34,165 --> 01:52:38,753
We know our way through the ruins!
Trust us! Hurry!

997
01:52:44,342 --> 01:52:47,553
<i>I WAS ON THE SIDE
OF THE RED BEASTS</i>

998
01:52:50,723 --> 01:52:53,518
<i>I SUPPORTED THE BOLSHEVIKS</i>

999
01:53:01,025 --> 01:53:02,777
I hope the Russians
got our message.

1000
01:53:03,152 --> 01:53:07,073
- We'll know in a minute.
- Or maybe not.

1001
01:53:11,077 --> 01:53:12,745
What news do you
bring us, General?

1002
01:53:14,539 --> 01:53:19,419
Hitler and his wife committed
suicide in the Führer's bunker.

1003
01:53:22,672 --> 01:53:24,799
The new government
has empowered me...

1004
01:53:25,133 --> 01:53:28,594
to begin peace negotiations...

1005
01:53:29,345 --> 01:53:32,181
between our two countries...

1006
01:53:33,182 --> 01:53:38,563
which have suffered
the highest casualties.

1007
01:53:39,772 --> 01:53:44,694
General, would you want peace
in my position?

1008
01:53:45,153 --> 01:53:50,074
My government will not accept
an unconditional surrender.

1009
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:56,497
Under the circumstances,
there's no other alternative.

1010
01:53:59,459 --> 01:54:02,545
We'll never surrender!
Outrageous!

1011
01:54:02,712 --> 01:54:05,381
I conquered Berlin
against the Reds years ago!

1012
01:54:05,548 --> 01:54:10,595
And I will defend it against
the Reds to my dying breath!

1013
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:13,473
I won't use my final hours
as Reich Chancellor...

1014
01:54:14,057 --> 01:54:18,311
to sign a statement of surrender!

1015
01:54:18,519 --> 01:54:21,606
- We must protect civilians!
- The Führer order is final!

1016
01:54:21,773 --> 01:54:26,277
- Have you gone mad?
- We have to negotiate.

1017
01:54:26,694 --> 01:54:28,237
I repeat, gentlemen:

1018
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:32,575
- I will never agree to surrender!
- Telegraph Marshal Schukov.

1019
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,494
- Marshal Schukov?
- What's going on?

1020
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,662
This is crazy!
We must surrender to the Russians!

1021
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,750
I'll shoot you! The Führer
forbade any kind of surrender!

1022
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:04,232
- How long does it last?
- About four hours.

1023
01:55:20,206 --> 01:55:23,167
"Hansel crumbled his bread
in his pocket...

1024
01:55:23,376 --> 01:55:27,588
and on their way
into the forest...

1025
01:55:27,713 --> 01:55:30,174
he threw a morsel on the ground.

1026
01:55:30,299 --> 01:55:35,054
The woman led the children
still deeper into the forest...

1027
01:55:35,179 --> 01:55:37,181
where they had never
in their lives been before.

1028
01:55:37,306 --> 01:55:39,142
Then a great fire
was again made...

1029
01:55:39,267 --> 01:55:40,785
and the mother said,
'Just sit there, you children..."'

1030
01:55:40,852 --> 01:55:42,311
All right, children.

1031
01:55:42,603 --> 01:55:45,731
Dr. Stumpfegger has brought
the medicine I told you about.

1032
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:49,193
It's bitter,
but it's good for you.

1033
01:55:50,194 --> 01:55:53,239
Everyone gets a sip.

1034
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,283
Who's first?

1035
01:55:58,327 --> 01:56:00,386
Heide, you're always so brave.

1036
01:56:07,712 --> 01:56:10,590
One more sip.

1037
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:14,719
It wasn't that bad.

1038
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:22,602
Good. Helmut?

1039
01:56:24,812 --> 01:56:26,063
Good.

1040
01:56:26,230 --> 01:56:29,442
It will keep you from getting sick
in this damp bunker.

1041
01:56:29,692 --> 01:56:33,112
But it isn't damp here.

1042
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:39,118
Good, good.

1043
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:50,213
Helga...

1044
01:56:52,256 --> 01:56:56,385
- I don't want any.
- Do you want to get sick?

1045
01:56:56,636 --> 01:57:00,014
Please, Mama.
I don't want to.

1046
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:06,562
Don't cry.
It won't help if you cry.

1047
01:57:07,271 --> 01:57:09,774
You have to drink it.

1048
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:15,404
Helga!

1049
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:23,454
Helga! Come on!
Open your mouth!

1050
01:57:23,663 --> 01:57:25,581
Papa!

1051
01:57:28,167 --> 01:57:31,254
Drink! Drink!

1052
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,686
Sleep tight, children.

1053
01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:59,323
The lies will one clay vanish...

1054
01:57:59,782 --> 01:58:03,035
and light will
brighten the darkness.

1055
01:58:03,286 --> 01:58:05,705
Would you read it to me, please?

1056
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:11,419
"The lies will one day vanish and
light will brighten the darkness."

1057
01:58:12,378 --> 01:58:13,546
Let's do it again.

1058
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:18,050
The lies will one clay vanish,
and above them...

1059
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:21,095
truth will once again triumph.

1060
01:58:21,429 --> 01:58:25,182
It will be the moment
when we stand above everything...

1061
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:28,060
pure and...

1062
01:58:31,147 --> 01:58:32,440
unblemished.

1063
02:02:39,603 --> 02:02:43,357
- We don't stand a chance.
- I don't care. I want out.

1064
02:02:43,524 --> 02:02:47,778
- How do we cross the Russian lines?
- I won't stay a minute longer.

1065
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:52,157
- We're gonna die!
- Stop it! It won't be so bad.

1066
02:02:52,324 --> 02:02:53,784
The Russians
will get us if we stay.

1067
02:02:59,081 --> 02:03:01,667
Okay, let's go.

1068
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:34,176
<i>On April 30, 1945...</i>

1069
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:37,221
<i>the Führer committed suicide.</i>

1070
02:04:37,388 --> 02:04:42,434
<i>Thus, he abandoned all those
who had pledged allegiance to him.</i>

1071
02:04:42,726 --> 02:04:48,607
<i>German soldiers,
you obeyed the Führer orders...</i>

1072
02:04:48,732 --> 02:04:54,571
<i>and were prepared to
continue the battle for Berlin...</i>

1073
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:58,200
<i>although you were
running out of ammunition...</i>

1074
02:04:58,325 --> 02:05:00,661
<i>and further resistance was futile.</i>

1075
02:05:00,828 --> 02:05:05,499
<i>I order an immediate cease-fire.</i>

1076
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:08,711
<i>Every further hour of battle...</i>

1077
02:05:09,086 --> 02:05:13,048
<i>will only prolong the civilians'
terrible suffering...</i>

1078
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:15,759
<i>and the suffering of our wounded.</i>

1079
02:05:16,385 --> 02:05:20,305
<i>In agreement with the
Soviet Army Supreme Command...</i>

1080
02:05:20,472 --> 02:05:22,433
<i>I order you...</i>

1081
02:05:22,599 --> 02:05:26,270
<i>to cease fighting at once!</i>

1082
02:05:26,603 --> 02:05:28,147
Weidling...

1083
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:30,524
former Commanding Officer...

1084
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:33,777
of the Berlin Defense Force.

1085
02:05:35,738 --> 02:05:38,574
A glass of water, please.

1086
02:06:43,555 --> 02:06:46,266
I no longer need you.

1087
02:06:49,353 --> 02:06:51,730
The die is cast.

1088
02:07:59,423 --> 02:08:02,759
- It's time, Doctor.
- You see how busy we are.

1089
02:08:03,051 --> 02:08:06,054
I insist that you accompany us.

1090
02:08:07,306 --> 02:08:09,474
So that's it.

1091
02:08:16,398 --> 02:08:18,442
Go on.

1092
02:08:18,567 --> 02:08:22,362
You've done a great deal.
Thank you.

1093
02:08:28,577 --> 02:08:29,870
Schädle, come with me.

1094
02:08:30,537 --> 02:08:34,499
Sorry, I'm not going anywhere.

1095
02:08:36,168 --> 02:08:38,545
Let's go!

1096
02:09:56,039 --> 02:09:59,418
Sturmmann Krüger gets
the Iron Cross, 2nd class...

1097
02:09:59,543 --> 02:10:02,546
for defending Wolf Bridge.

1098
02:10:03,005 --> 02:10:06,007
Wagner took out
two machine-gun posts...

1099
02:10:06,008 --> 02:10:07,759
and defended Puttkammerstrasse.

1100
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:11,138
He gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class.

1101
02:10:11,638 --> 02:10:14,808
Sturmmann Rauch
gets the Iron Cross...

1102
02:10:15,142 --> 02:10:18,228
for helping messengers
get through enemy lines.

1103
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,636
The others!

1104
02:10:56,224 --> 02:10:58,060
Oh, God!

1105
02:11:01,313 --> 02:11:04,107
Get outta here!
Hurry!

1106
02:11:06,485 --> 02:11:08,153
Help!

1107
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:21,750
<i>Who goes there?</i>

1108
02:11:28,757 --> 02:11:30,717
A German.

1109
02:11:36,473 --> 02:11:38,433
Herr Hewel?

1110
02:11:39,476 --> 02:11:43,522
Hewel, thank God you're alive.

1111
02:11:45,732 --> 02:11:48,276
Where are the others?

1112
02:11:50,153 --> 02:11:54,324
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere... perhaps.

1113
02:11:54,533 --> 02:11:58,120
I'm sure most of the people
in my group are dead.

1114
02:11:58,370 --> 02:12:01,623
I never should have left the bunker.

1115
02:12:01,748 --> 02:12:04,209
I should have shot myself.

1116
02:12:05,502 --> 02:12:08,088
But I couldn't.

1117
02:12:08,255 --> 02:12:12,801
Eat something.
There's time enough to die.

1118
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:03,643
Attention!

1119
02:13:09,107 --> 02:13:11,234
Stay with the women.

1120
02:13:12,569 --> 02:13:14,613
Come here.

1121
02:13:26,249 --> 02:13:27,542
The Russians have us surrounded.

1122
02:13:28,251 --> 02:13:30,420
What will we do?

1123
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:33,715
You can try to get through.

1124
02:13:34,049 --> 02:13:35,342
I'm not taking another step.

1125
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:41,723
Think it over.
The Russians are only after us.

1126
02:13:42,015 --> 02:13:44,768
As women, you have a chance.

1127
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:47,145
Give it a try.

1128
02:13:47,812 --> 02:13:50,232
Good luck.

1129
02:13:52,317 --> 02:13:56,780
When you go past the Russians,
don't look anybody in the eye.

1130
02:13:57,239 --> 02:13:59,282
Don't forget.

1131
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:00,784
Good luck.

1132
02:14:09,501 --> 02:14:10,669
The Russians!

1133
02:14:23,306 --> 02:14:26,309
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

1134
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:29,604
- I can't go on.
- Please.

1135
02:14:31,690 --> 02:14:36,278
I have to try.
Don't be angry with me.

1136
02:14:40,282 --> 02:14:42,492
I'll manage.

1137
02:14:55,255 --> 02:14:56,673
Doctor!

1138
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:58,842
Herr Doctor!

1139
02:14:59,134 --> 02:15:01,803
My comrades want to surrender
to the Russians. May I join you?

1140
02:15:02,387 --> 02:15:03,805
The Führer is dead.

1141
02:15:04,097 --> 02:15:07,726
- You want to fight the war alone?
- I feel committed to my oath.

1142
02:15:08,727 --> 02:15:13,023
Then talk to the Brigadeführer.

1143
02:15:42,093 --> 02:15:43,813
- The Russians are clearing the area.
- Yes?

1144
02:15:43,845 --> 02:15:46,306
No resistance.
No shots have been fired.

1145
02:15:46,598 --> 02:15:49,559
They'll be here in an hour.

1146
02:15:50,101 --> 02:15:52,395
What should we do?

1147
02:15:52,562 --> 02:15:54,731
Our honor
won't allow us to surrender!

1148
02:15:55,273 --> 02:15:57,025
What does that mean?

1149
02:15:57,275 --> 02:16:01,029
When the Russians come,
we fire until we're out of bullets.

1150
02:16:01,196 --> 02:16:02,989
Then we blow our brains out.

1151
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:05,408
Rubbish!

1152
02:16:05,533 --> 02:16:10,455
Is this murderous, suicidal killing
for prestige the only way out?

1153
02:16:10,789 --> 02:16:15,085
We're SS officers.
We can't outlive the Führer death!

1154
02:16:15,251 --> 02:16:17,504
Who else feels that way?

1155
02:18:05,153 --> 02:18:09,282
- Want to sit with me a moment?
- I'd love to.

1156
02:18:14,287 --> 02:18:15,755
Why do you want to go on living?

1157
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:21,085
And why do you want to die?

1158
02:18:21,294 --> 02:18:23,046
See this?

1159
02:18:23,713 --> 02:18:26,424
The Führer himself gave it to me.

1160
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:29,719
A final decoration?

1161
02:18:30,053 --> 02:18:34,390
Perhaps. Hitler gave it to me
at his farewell.

1162
02:18:34,557 --> 02:18:38,228
He made me swear a vow.

1163
02:18:38,394 --> 02:18:42,732
That I would kill myself
the moment the Russians captured me.

1164
02:18:43,274 --> 02:18:46,611
Hitler made you promise
to kill yourself?

1165
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,072
- But why?
- He probably...

1166
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:53,743
didn't want me to be forced
to speak negatively of him.

1167
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:58,832
But as a diplomat, you are
protected by international law.

1168
02:18:59,123 --> 02:19:02,836
Who will benefit
if you keep your promise?

1169
02:19:03,169 --> 02:19:05,463
They're here!

1170
02:19:17,767 --> 02:19:21,145
Don't shoot, comrades!

1171
02:19:23,356 --> 02:19:26,067
We have surrendered.

1172
02:19:26,234 --> 02:19:28,278
The war is over.

1173
02:19:29,362 --> 02:19:31,489
It's over.

1174
02:21:04,457 --> 02:21:06,751
GERMANY OFFICIALLY
SURRENDERED

1175
02:21:07,043 --> 02:21:08,461
ON MAY 7, 1945.

1176
02:21:09,671 --> 02:21:12,090
IT WAS AGREED THAT
ALL HOSTILITIES

1177
02:21:12,256 --> 02:21:13,633
END AT MIDNIGHT, MAY 8.

1178
02:21:14,759 --> 02:21:17,637
BY THEN, THE WAR HAD COST

1179
02:21:17,804 --> 02:21:19,347
OVER 50 MILLION LIVES.

1180
02:21:20,223 --> 02:21:23,685
SIX MILLIONS JEWS
HAD BEEN MURDERED

1181
02:21:24,018 --> 02:21:26,312
IN GERMAN
CONCENTRATION CAMPS

1182
02:21:26,729 --> 02:21:30,483
WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE AND
AVOIDED IMPRISONMENT.

1183
02:21:30,650 --> 02:21:35,405
SHE DIED IN DUSSELDORF
ON APRIL 14, 1997.

1184
02:21:35,697 --> 02:21:39,158
RELIEVED FROM
SOVIET CAPTIVITY IN 1953.

1185
02:21:39,325 --> 02:21:44,288
HE DIED IN AACHEN
ON DECEMBER 21, 1998.

1186
02:21:44,497 --> 02:21:48,292
RELIEVED FROM
SOVIET CAPTIVITY IN 1955.

1187
02:21:48,459 --> 02:21:52,714
HE DIED IN DAMP, NEAR
ECKERNFÖRDE, ON AUGUST 6, 2001.

1188
02:21:53,089 --> 02:21:59,637
DIED IN SOVIET
CAPTIVITY IN 1955.

1189
02:21:59,804 --> 02:22:04,350
ARRESTED BY THE RED ARMY IN
THE MILITARY HOSPITAL BUNKER.

1190
02:22:04,517 --> 02:22:09,063
HE DIED IN SOVIET

1222
02:23:45,618 --> 02:23:48,745
<i>Of course, the terrible things...</i>

1223
02:23:48,746 --> 02:23:51,623
<i>I heard from
the Nuremberg Trials...</i>

1224
02:23:51,624 --> 02:23:57,547
about the six millions Jews
and the people of other races...

1225
02:23:57,713 --> 02:23:59,714
who were killed...

1226
02:23:59,715 --> 02:24:04,637
were facts
that shocked me deeply.

1227
02:24:05,263 --> 02:24:10,351
But I wasn't able to see
the connection with my own past.

1228
02:24:10,518 --> 02:24:15,731
I was satisfied that
I wasn't personally to blame...

1229
02:24:16,065 --> 02:24:21,445
and that I hadn't known
about those things.

1230
02:24:21,612 --> 02:24:23,823
I wasn't aware of the extent.
But one clay...

1231
02:24:24,157 --> 02:24:28,286
I went past the memorial plaque...

1232
02:24:28,494 --> 02:24:32,123
which had been put up for Sophie
Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse...

1233
02:24:32,248 --> 02:24:36,377
and I saw that she was born
the same year as me...

1234
02:24:36,544 --> 02:24:42,508
and she was executed the same year
I started working for Hitler.

1235
02:24:42,717 --> 02:24:45,636
And at that moment...

1236
02:24:45,803 --> 02:24:51,684
I actually sensed that it was
no excuse to be young...

1237
02:24:52,059 --> 02:24:55,062
and that it would
have been possible...

1238
02:24:55,271 --> 02:24:57,648
to find things out.
