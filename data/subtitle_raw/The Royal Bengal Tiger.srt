1
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,425
Lalbazar, Kolkata.

2
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,143
So, Abhiroop Babu?

3
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:25,184
Everyone gave me
their version of the story.

4
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,751
Now let me hear...

5
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,762
...your version.

6
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,178
Why are you laughing?
Just keep quiet.

7
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,478
Don't laugh at all.
Just keep quiet.

8
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,490
Everything has happened because of you.
Keep quiet.

9
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,524
I am warning you. Keep quiet.

10
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:24,429
ONE WEEK AGO

11
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:28,971
Apu.

12
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,435
The button of the shirt has come off.

13
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,806
Wear some other shirt.

14
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,910
Okay.

15
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,076
But I am not getting my brown trouser.

16
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,514
It hasn't been brought
back from the washer man. Right?

17
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,283
Today, your lunch
isn't ready as well.

18
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,150
You have to eat at the canteen.

19
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,414
Okay.

20
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,382
And since you have to buy food
from the canteen today...

21
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,156
...go to the office walking from the
station. Don't take a taxi.

22
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:51,753
Okay.

23
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,366
Listen, what is okay about it?
Tell me.

24
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,693
What happened now?

25
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,397
How can everything
be fine for you, Abhi?

26
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,697
Don't you ever feel angry?

27
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,140
No. Look,
you have so much of work anyway.

28
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,301
And amidst that, if you have to look
into such trivial issues as well...

29
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:06,140
Which era do you belong to?

30
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,971
Your shirt, trouser, Tiffin...

31
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,106
Nothing is ready.
You are not angry.

32
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,808
I am asking you to walk to office.

33
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,977
And you don't show
any reaction to even that?

34
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:17,387
Abhi. Sometimes, I really feel that you
don't really care about what I say or do.

35
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,651
You are completely
indifferent towards me.

36
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,817
What is this, Apu?

37
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,727
You are turning this matter into another
angle now. Tell me. Is this right?

38
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,697
I don't care what is right or wrong.
You must make a decision today.

39
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,062
How?

40
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,262
Scold me!

41
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,459
What?

42
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:32,996
Scold me!

43
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,000
Apu.

44
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,379
If you don't get my trouser...

45
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,112
...I will go to office like this.

46
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,691
Buenos Aires.
- Argentina.

47
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,359
Rome? - Italy.

48
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,325
Copenhagen.
- Denmark.

49
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,830
My dear,
hope the food was enough.

50
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:05,962
Beijing.

51
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:09,735
But grandfather, there was
no fruit in fruitcake. - Correct.

52
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,878
My dear, a name may not
always show the true qualities.

53
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:17,113
Akashganga means Milky way.
Does it have milk in it, my dear?

54
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,674
Nor does sweet betel
have sweets in it. Tell me.

55
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,751
But grandpa, does money grow
on money plants (coriander)?

56
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,119
Keep quiet.
Fallen fellow! Lowly creature.

57
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,089
What is it?
Did you do homework today? - Move.

58
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,860
Chandu sir will take you to task today.

59
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:29,917
Forget it.

60
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,120
You couldn't leave it.

61
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,648
It is a big problem in the morning.

62
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,123
Every smoker has the same excuse.

63
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,022
I have decided now.

64
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,855
One in the morning,
one in the afternoon after lunch...

65
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,192
...and one before going off to sleep
at night. Three in a day. That is it.

66
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,832
What does Madhubala say?

67
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,937
Madhubala says that we must go in
for a sweet and peaceful mutual divorce.

68
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,430
If I challenge or ask for alimony...

69
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,567
...the matter will be stretched
over a long period of time.

70
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:22,375
I guess you should opt for a mutual
and amicable settlement.

71
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,050
You don't need alimony anyway.
- This isn't about the need, Abhi.

72
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,014
What he has done to me, it is
about squeezing him by his testicles.

73
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:33,820
I will rip it off him and make
him wear it as a pendant on his neck.

74
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,595
It is not just a case of alimony.
- Yes.

75
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,392
You are absolutely right.
You are correct.

76
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,093
You can hang them as
the pendant on his neck.

77
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,035
It will hang there for his entire life.

78
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:52,435
This is my husband's visiting card.
He is a lawyer. Honest.

79
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,574
Madhubala and all wouldn't
be able to do anything.

80
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,206
She has been bribed.

81
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,278
Hey, what do men think anyway?
What do they think?

82
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,981
They can do anything that
comes to their mind anytime.

83
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,421
And then,
fool us and show us their thumb...

84
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:06,355
...and get away from
the scene conveniently?

85
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,788
Oh my God.
Think about her husband once.

86
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,129
Why are you getting worried?

87
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,862
Don't get tensed. I will do it.

88
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,870
Asim seems to be at work.

89
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,872
He would have earned a lot
if he was into cricket betting.

90
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,066
How?

91
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,233
His way of earning is by
giving information about...

92
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,778
...the various stocks
kept in various warehouses.

93
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,038
Give these files to Dipankar.

94
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,069
There are seven in all.

95
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,001
Abhi. GM sir has called you.

96
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,897
GM sir has called him.

97
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,369
I have some bad news for you, Abhi.

98
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,076
There has been a notice from Delhi.

99
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,686
We are overstaffed
with B-grade officers.

100
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,320
We have to downsize.

101
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,998
That is why it has been
decided that from next week...

102
00:10:55,735 --> 00:11:00,104
...you are going to be an A-grade
officer, Mr. Abhiroop Banerjee.

103
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,041
Next week,
you will get the letter in your hand.

104
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,978
Thank you, sir.

105
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,555
Yes. Keep this file.

106
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,131
Yes.

107
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:44,850
Yes.

108
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,213
These are the files.

109
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:03,265
Very, very good. This will do.

110
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,101
Who is your designer?

111
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,899
I do it myself.
- I see.

112
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,763
Shall I ask for tea or coffee for you?

113
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:09,637
No, no. Let it be for today.

114
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,039
I have some more deliveries to make.

115
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:12,270
Okay, okay.

116
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,178
What about the check, Girish?

117
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,342
What are you saying?
The bill isn't made yet.

118
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,147
You can come next month.

119
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:28,150
Oh my God.
Abhi, that is wonderful news.

120
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,286
And we are eating
in this rotten canteen?

121
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,260
I want a treat. Today.

122
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:33,864
Tomorrow.

123
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,167
Why tomorrow?

124
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,963
What is so important
that you must do today?

125
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,231
Aparna should get
the first treat, right?

126
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:44,740
Are you going to be distributing
the sweets today?

127
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,438
Or after you get the letter?

128
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:48,371
Congratulations.

129
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,280
How did you come to know?

130
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,079
Thank you.

131
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,054
Even I was in the queue, right?

132
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,156
I can smell something burning.

133
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,660
Where are you going now? Home?

134
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,330
Don't you think it is going to
be a surprise for Aparna?

135
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,034
Yes. A good surprise.

136
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,643
Hey, darling.
- Look here, Miss hot.

137
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,772
Hey, do you want to come with me?

138
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:30,952
Did you see his face?

139
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:32,381
Yes.

140
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,722
His move failed.
- It is obvious.

141
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:49,237
"I am mesmerized with the beauty."

142
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,667
"There are flowers blooming all around."

143
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,737
"No one is..."
- Mr. Pakrasi.

144
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,077
Tell me, Abhi.

145
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,519
I wanted to say that you
still haven't paid the rent.

146
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:02,952
Hey, this is from Flury's.
Show me.

147
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,647
No, no. This isn't anything.
- Show me.

148
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,589
No, no. This is...
- What is this?

149
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,683
Show it to me. Wow, this is great.
- You have not paid the rent.

150
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:10,695
That is why I wanted to talk...
- Chicken patties. Wow.

151
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:12,253
And you were hiding
and taking it away? Right?

152
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:16,031
Now this is...
- Wow. Great. Just great.

153
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,598
Bengalis will die eating.

154
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,696
I got it but...
- You have satisfied me today.

155
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,934
Yes. But your rent for 6 months is left.

156
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,669
Hey, it will be done.
It will be done for sure.

157
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,143
I will get a payment within
a day or two. It will be done.

158
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:30,478
Now... Listen.
- "You want to cheat me."

159
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,849
"Do you think I am a fool?"

160
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:45,988
"Hey! My lover.
Don't cheat me."

161
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,449
What is this?
- Food.

162
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,247
All of a sudden?

163
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:12,084
The office canteen owner gave me...

164
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,785
...a gift for being
the most valuable customer.

165
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,124
Abhi. I don't like jokes at all.

166
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,326
Promotion.

167
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:22,798
What?

168
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:27,000
Sumit. Wait. - GM sir called
me on his own and gave me the news.

169
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,039
And then, he said...
- Mother. Patties.

170
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,599
Yes. - He said that
I will get the letter next week.

171
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:32,701
And listen.
- Yes?

172
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:33,836
Have you done the homework?

173
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,938
There is a little bit left.
- Then why are you reading Superman comics?

174
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,711
Please don't say anything to him today.
We have got such good news today.

175
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,820
Sumit, what are you doing?

176
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,222
I am a Superman.

177
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:46,887
Father.
- Yes?

178
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,223
Why does Superman
only stay in America?

179
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,786
If the traffic would
have been lesser in Kolkata...

180
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,223
...he could have stayed
in Kolkata as well.

181
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,326
Why only Kolkata? He could have stayed
in our 10/5 Ballygunge as well.

182
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,631
Make your father wear his underwear
over his pant. You will see that he...

183
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,297
...has turned into Superman.

184
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:29,357
I have given the ultimatum for the rent.
I will get it within a day or two.

185
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,939
Father.
- Yes?

186
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,636
Could uncle Anjan be Superman?

187
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,975
Anjan could do everything.

188
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:43,112
Yes!

189
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,672
Superman.

190
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,742
Yes.
- Now get down.

191
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,969
"This is a new morning."

192
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,472
"It is getting ready again."

193
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,136
"In another unknown hope."

194
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,581
"The traffic on the
road is always on the move."

195
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:52,014
"There is no time to stop."

196
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,814
"On a new date."

197
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,482
"It will call out in a new language."

198
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,960
"This is the beginning
of another new day."

199
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:10,198
"In the eyes of another new day."

200
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:15,840
"New colors can be seen."

201
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,170
"This is a new morning."

202
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,611
"It is getting ready again."

203
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:26,174
"In another unknown hope."

204
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,713
"There is no time to stop."

205
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,155
"On a new date."

206
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:38,493
"It will call out in a new language."

207
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:43,034
"This is the beginning
of another new day."

208
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:47,999
"In the eyes of another new day."

209
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:55,980
"New colors can be seen."

210
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:02,849
Yes. I will do this afternoon.

211
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:09,760
Where is the labor
payment file for April?

212
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:14,429
Sir. I had computed it and
sent it to Dipankar for tabulation.

213
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,924
He didn't get it.

214
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,364
Raju had taken it, sir.

215
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:23,598
Listen. You have signed for seven
files in the 'Out' register.

216
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,336
Dipankar has got only 6.

217
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,873
The labor payment file
for April is not there at all.

218
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,378
It cannot just vanish.

219
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:31,916
No.
- Can it?

220
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,747
So either look for the
file or make another file.

221
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,016
The audit will start tomorrow.
It is an important file.

222
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,222
And I guess you know...

223
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,594
...what will happen if the Lifting
companies don't receive their payments.

224
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:47,632
Yes?

225
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,332
The stuff will be lying
around and will rot.

226
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,630
How much of time will
it take to make a new file?

227
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,109
It will take a long time, sir.

228
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:02,976
It will involve taking print out of all
the documents of the various companies.

229
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,378
If I have to tally it
with the corresponding data...

230
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,009
If you don't get it, make it.

231
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:09,011
I will tell Dipankar.

232
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:11,282
He will come earlier tomorrow
and make the tabulation.

233
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:13,348
Okay?

234
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,426
Why are you standing here? Go.

235
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:18,720
Yes.

236
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,530
That was great.
- Superb! Bravo.

237
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,593
That was great.
- That was a superb shot, crazy one.

238
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,968
Mind-blowing.
- Superb! Great.

239
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:29,633
Raju.

240
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,140
I had given you seven files
to give to Dipankar. - Maybe.

241
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,305
Not maybe. I did give them to you.

242
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,680
Hey, I transfer hundreds of files
from one table to another in a day.

243
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,446
How would I remember, Abhi?

244
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,750
That is right. But...

245
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:45,747
You are too much.

246
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:50,592
Great. Superb.

247
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,654
What is happening here?
We will lose if this goes on.

248
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,426
He is winning the match single handedly.

249
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,591
Too much.

250
00:20:58,437 --> 00:20:59,699
Dipankar.

251
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,740
That was a great shot.
- I had sent 7 files to you.

252
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,605
One of them was the
labor payment file of April.

253
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,741
Yes. I have spoken to the
GM in the morning regarding this.

254
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:12,841
Yes.

255
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,845
But I have only got 6 files.

256
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,356
Can you please look around your desk?

257
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,883
Since you are asking me to do it,
I will search.

258
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,360
Come on, give it to me.

259
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,795
This is a very important file, Dipankar.

260
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,393
Okay. Wait for an hour.
I will look into this.

261
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,864
Dipankar. Meaning...

262
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,705
Do you consider playing carom
more important than the file?

263
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,868
Why are you bothering me?

264
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,970
Go on. I told you that I will search.

265
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:46,281
I did give seven files to you, Dipankar.

266
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:49,386
You are making a mistake, Abhi.

267
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,286
Wow. That is great.
- I am making a mistake?

268
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,957
I am making a mistake?

269
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:57,593
Tell me. Where is the file?

270
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,893
Tell me. Where is the file?

271
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,523
Tell me. Where is the file?

272
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,134
Tell me. Where is the file?

273
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:10,235
Great. Great. You are superb.

274
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:11,934
What is the score?
- 3 and 16.

275
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,273
3 and 16? Okay, come on.

276
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:16,177
Come on. Reset. Reset.
I will defeat you in the next game, sir.

277
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:16,907
Come on. Come on. Come on.

278
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,415
Set it. Set it. Set it.

279
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,148
Now this table is going to be...
- The first turn will be mine.

280
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,553
Hey, show it to me. - Hey, don't worry.
We will win this time for sure.

281
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:28,218
Let us practice a bit.
- Hey, pass the striker to me. Come on.

282
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,556
Yes?
- Hello, Aparna.

283
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:04,260
I will be a little late today.
- Why?

284
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:07,492
Actually some urgent work came up.

285
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,725
Abhi. We have to go
to father's place today.

286
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,633
You had told me that you will go.

287
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:15,869
Such functions keep
on happening in your house.

288
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:17,737
Let it pass.

289
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,441
Abhi. Is everything fine?

290
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,071
Yes. Everything is fine.
I am hanging up.

291
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:33,519
Come on. Let us leave now.
- Yes. I have to reach home early today.

292
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,116
Are you going by train?
- Yes. Let us go.

293
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,167
I will call you.
- Yes.

294
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:01,447
How much longer is it going to take?

295
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,484
It will take time.

296
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,817
Should I wait?

297
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:06,984
No. Let it be. Leave.

298
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,357
Okay. Bye.
- Yes.

299
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:27,602
Hey, come on. Look at me.
- Hey, what is it in the bag?

300
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,772
Come on. Show it to us.
- Why are you ignoring us, darling?

301
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,316
You are so beautiful.
- Why don't you look at us?

302
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:35,113
She is superb.
- You bet she is.

303
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:44,659
"It is the same color
and yet it is different."

304
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:49,428
"It is the same way in
which the heart has been bound."

305
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,230
"And yet, I am running ahead..."

306
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,804
Hi. Hi.
- Happy anniversary, father.

307
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,407
Abhi didn't come?

308
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,309
He is stuck in important
work at the office.

309
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:11,514
"This is a dream.
It is changing again."

310
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,391
"No one knows the direction
in which life is moving."

311
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:19,594
"There and hopes and faith."

312
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:22,133
"Of expressing everything."

313
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,567
"Nothing really exists."

314
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,901
"Everything gets covered in the fog."

315
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:33,069
"At the end of another day."

316
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:40,317
"It is the beginning of another night."

317
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:46,252
"It begins in various places."

318
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,905
"How will it happen?"

319
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,543
"Where should I go?"

320
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,841
"The state of affairs is bad."

321
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,522
I see. Abhi. Come in.

322
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,497
No, I mean...
- "In this world."

323
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,032
The rent...

324
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,797
I see. The rent?
Hey, you will get it. You will get it.

325
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:09,965
Do you think I will steal your
ground floor in my pocket and run away?

326
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:15,207
No. It isn't so. But it is...
- Please tell your wife not to worry at all.

327
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,214
No tension. You will get it.

328
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,045
Actually you had told me
that you are going to get a payment.

329
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,643
It hasn't come...
- And today...

330
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,320
You will get it as soon as I get it.

331
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:28,424
Look, Mr. Pakrasi.

332
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,188
Yes.
- I am sure you don't like it that...

333
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,093
...I come to your place
for asking for money everyday.

334
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,791
Yes...
- Even I don't like it.

335
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,330
So if you could pay the rent...

336
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:02,720
Hello, father.

337
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:10,592
Abhi.
- Yes?

338
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:21,768
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

339
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,175
Thank you. Come to me, dear.

340
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:28,110
Thank you.

341
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,613
Leave me.
- Why?

342
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,987
I have work.
- What happened to you? Hey.

343
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,797
Wow.
- Happy birthday.

344
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:40,889
Thank you.

345
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,931
Happy birthday.
- Wow.

346
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,467
Wow!

347
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:57,804
Thank you.

348
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,091
Mogambo is happy.

349
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:10,959
My Mogambo is happy with everything.

350
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:12,758
But now, if we don't
get the rent on time...

351
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:16,392
...we wouldn't be able to go for a tour
of Rajasthan for this veneration holiday.

352
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,436
There are only three months
left for that.

353
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:23,839
And if we cannot go, Mrs. Mogambo and
Master Mogambo wouldn't be happy at all.

354
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,506
No, no. Thankfully you reminded me.

355
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,338
Sumit. Get ready.
I am going downstairs.

356
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:30,244
Got it?

357
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,476
I am going and talking to Pakrasi.
I am going.

358
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:33,944
What do you mean you are going?

359
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,542
You got a shirt and had Payesh(sweet).

360
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,952
You must tell me
what I am going to get for my efforts.

361
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:39,654
Now...

362
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,919
The kitchen is closed tonight.
We will go out for dinner.

363
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,858
Yes.
- Mrs. Mogambo is happy.

364
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,421
I am leaving. Sumit, get ready.
- Yes, father.

365
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,211
What are you doing, Sumit?

366
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,210
Mother. You got to look cool!

367
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,429
Mr. Pakrasi.

368
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,196
Yes.

369
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,366
What is the matter, Abhi?

370
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,339
Didn't you go home last night?

371
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,844
No, no, I did.

372
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,446
So?

373
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:37,905
What brings you back again now?

374
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,218
I mean if you could pay the rent...

375
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:43,652
Hey, stop it. Rent!

376
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:47,222
Rent! Rent!
Don't you have any other work?

377
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:48,859
You are a strange man!

378
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,292
No...
- Be it night or be it day...

379
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:51,829
Now...
- You always come here asking for rent.

380
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:53,524
Do you think I am a thief?

381
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,060
Look... - I will not give the rent.
What will you do?

382
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,794
Get lost.
Go and call anyone you wish to call.

383
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:02,897
Come with me.
- Where?

384
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,942
Hey, I am telling you. Come with me.

385
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:06,970
Leave it.
- Come on. I am with you.

386
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:08,909
Stop it. Look, don't get into this mess.

387
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,607
Come on. Come with me.
- What is the need? Leave it.

388
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:13,582
No, no, I will talk to him today.
What did you tell him?

389
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,383
Look, daughter-in-law.
Why are you getting into this?

390
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,651
The ones who don't pay rent for
days on end are called thieves.

391
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,487
My husband is a very nice man.
- You...

392
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,891
That is why he trusts
lowly people like you.

393
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,826
Keep quiet. - No. I need to say this.
- What did you say?

394
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,023
No, no. - I called you a thief.
Cannot you hear me?

395
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,793
Oh no. Please keep quiet.
- What do you mean? - I need to tell him all this.

396
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,232
What is it that you don't understand?
I said what I meant.

397
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:31,529
If you don't understand,
I will say it again.

398
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:32,797
Listen to me. Please keep quiet...
- You are a thief.

399
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,736
Hey! Mind your language.

400
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,273
No. - Don't assume I will spare you
just because you are a woman!

401
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:39,138
Please calm down. Please. No, if you would
have paid our rent for 6 months...

402
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,768
...you wouldn't have had
to listen to all this today.

403
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,040
What is the need to say this?
- Hey, she is so strange.

404
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,891
Abhi. Let us go home.

405
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:42,899
Come on.

406
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,703
Father. What happened, father?

407
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,750
Did uncle say anything to you, father?

408
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,861
Abhi. GM sir has called you.

409
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,696
What have you done?

410
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:25,076
None of the figures tally
with the corresponding voucher.

411
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,878
You would have made extra
payment for 500 laborers.

412
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,210
There would have been
an extra payment of two lakhs...

413
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,842
...if Dipankar wouldn't have noticed.

414
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,918
This is what you have done?

415
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,056
What is the answer that
I shall give to my auditors?

416
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,725
My officer was on drugs
while working at night.

417
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,887
Sir. Sorry.

418
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:50,530
Actually Abhi is not
good with computers.

419
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,670
Maybe that is the reason
he has made these mistakes.

420
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,832
In that case,
this work should have been hand written.

421
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:58,441
You don't deserve a computer.

422
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:03,071
Sir. Shall I make the file?

423
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,846
It will be made quickly.

424
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,346
Do you have anything to say, Abhi?

425
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,853
Do I get any answer from you?

426
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:19,293
Well. Then I will
find the answers myself.

427
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:01,928
This wouldn't have had any value
if I didn't give this to you today.

428
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:05,041
Happy birthday.

429
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:26,922
It is very late at night.
Shall we go now?

430
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,930
Let us go.

431
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:51,454
You are not ready yet, mother?
- I will get ready.

432
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:55,656
Let your father come back.
I will get ready.

433
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:01,597
What happened, Sumit?

434
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:09,806
The ticket cost of Boss is 200.
- I like the songs.

435
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,432
Hey, Boss is great.
- I am a huge fan of him.

436
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,773
But the film is great...
- Hey, she is here. She is here.

437
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,416
She is here...
- Wow.

438
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:22,248
Hey, she is wearing a yellow sari.
Brother is so lucky!

439
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,821
She is so beautiful.
- Yellow fairy.

440
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:25,947
Hey.

441
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:30,289
Show it to us.
- Madam. It is such a nice sari.

442
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:33,489
Look at her body.
- Hey, she is so beautiful. Superb.

443
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,458
Hey... - Hey,
she is so attractive. Superb.

444
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:37,899
Show us the bag too, madam...
- Abhi!

445
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,664
Oh my God.
Brother isn't doing anything. - Abhi.

446
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:43,969
Hey, no, no.
He doesn't have the guts to do anything.

447
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,600
Let me see, dear.

448
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,373
She is so good looking.
- Abhi, do something.

449
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,046
Abhi!

450
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,800
Hey, friend.

451
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,214
How are you, my friend?

452
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,010
Anjan!

453
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:36,172
Father first. And then, mother.

454
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:37,711
Passed away in a span of two years.

455
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,448
That is it. Nothing was left.

456
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:41,614
Then I sold off the property of Kasba.

457
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,519
I completed all the work here.
And then, straight out.

458
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,883
I was out of India for ten years.
No connection.

459
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:53,057
One day, all of a sudden, I started
wondering what is our city up to.

460
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,121
Let me go and see.

461
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,690
That is why I am back.

462
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,994
And look, who would have thought
I would meet you like this?

463
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,333
Even I hadn't hoped that
I will meet you like this.

464
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:03,600
What are you doing these days?

465
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,005
Importer in the US of A.

466
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,074
These imported clothes
slow down the entire process.

467
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,250
6 buttons. 3 hooks.

468
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,149
And then, another button
in the southern hemisphere.

469
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,711
The zip comes after that.
And we are moving towards the jet age...

470
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,484
...where time is money.

471
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:25,255
That is why the best option
after graduation is to go to America...

472
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,320
...and sell Saris,
petticoats and loin cloth.

473
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,990
A cultural change in the US of A.

474
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,731
An attire of convenience.

475
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,366
Saris, petticoats and loin cloth?

476
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,006
Friend.

477
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,570
I can see that you still
have the bright spark. Yes?

478
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,348
And what about you?

479
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:49,678
I am one of the ordinary
officers of FGCI.

480
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:53,583
Do you have a problem?

481
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,056
No.

482
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,428
You are married.

483
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:04,296
I have a son.
Sumit. He is eight years old.

484
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,297
That is great.

485
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,004
So where are we going now?

486
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,936
Home. Aparna, my wife and
Sumit have heard a lot about you.

487
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,440
What did you tell them?

488
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:19,380
I have told them that you
were my bodyguard in school.

489
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,597
Do you remember...

490
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:35,291
...the way we thrashed the Sardar
child by throwing him on the ground?

491
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:35,956
Yes.

492
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:38,900
He entangled his leg into mine and made
me fall while we were at the flat race.

493
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:42,362
That means I command a certain
respect in your house, right?

494
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,635
A lot more than me.

495
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:48,275
Abhi.

496
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:51,343
Drop the plan of going
to your house today.

497
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:52,541
I am going to your
house for the first time...

498
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,481
...and I will
meet your wife and kid.

499
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:56,582
It doesn't seem right
if I go empty handed.

500
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:57,780
So?

501
00:42:58,689 --> 00:42:59,587
I am hungry.

502
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,952
What do you want to eat?

503
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:06,524
Think about it and tell me.
You haven't lost the spark yet, friend.

504
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,834
Coffee and chicken snack?
- Bull's eye.

505
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:11,926
Come on.

506
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,769
For how long are you here?

507
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:16,466
I am here, friend.
I am going to be here for a few days.

508
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:00,517
Yes, sir?
- Two cups of coffee and chicken snacks.

509
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:03,314
And throw in some salad as well.

510
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:08,514
Wow! Some attitude.

511
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,355
So tell me. What is the problem?

512
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,326
What problem?

513
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:19,396
Something has happened for sure.

514
00:44:20,805 --> 00:44:22,602
I can still read your face.

515
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,567
There are a lot of problems. Forget it.

516
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,106
Tell me.

517
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:43,121
Hey! Mind your language.

518
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,022
Don't think I will spare you just
because you are a woman.

519
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,564
You would have made extra
payment for 500 laborers.

520
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,207
Hey, fool. Get lost.
- Hello, yellow fairy.

521
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:09,978
You didn't give the salad, chief?

522
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,022
Why didn't you get the salad?

523
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,816
We don't serve salad with this.

524
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,798
Do you have LIC?

525
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,533
Yes.
- For how much?

526
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:29,699
Around five lakhs.

527
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:32,709
And along with PF and gratuity,
another ten to fifteen?

528
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:34,777
Yes. Maybe I do.

529
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:36,807
And what is the price of your house?

530
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:38,809
Around 10 crores.

531
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:41,047
Yes.

532
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:47,689
So friend, if something happens to you,
your family is taken care of.

533
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:50,325
What are you scared of?

534
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:53,857
For yourself or for others?

535
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:01,501
It is your birthday today, right?

536
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,841
Do you remember I
had told you long back...

537
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:13,747
...that you will be born
again on your 35th birthday?

538
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:20,385
Do you still believe in
palmistry and all? - Of course.

539
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:25,688
Check it once.

540
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,699
What is this?

541
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,150
Always remember.

542
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,590
Fear is just a state of mind.

543
00:47:41,205 --> 00:47:42,229
Come on.

544
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,859
Hey!

545
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:21,734
Hey! Who is it?

546
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:26,637
Hey! Go off to sleep. Go off to sleep.

547
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:30,708
I think it must be a cat or a dog.
- Okay, boss.

548
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:19,726
I have got it.
- Let us go.

549
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,640
Anjan. Anjan.

550
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:37,744
I am very scared.

551
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:39,607
Then why did you come?

552
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:41,415
At that time,
I thought I will be able to do it.

553
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:42,782
But now...

554
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:47,217
The file wouldn't come
flying to you, friend.

555
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,149
Come on.

556
00:50:58,435 --> 00:51:00,096
Which one is Dipankar's table?

557
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:02,596
Forget it, Anjan.
You don't have to do anything.

558
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:04,504
Come on. Let us go back.
- Which one?

559
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:08,537
This one...

560
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:21,182
What are you doing, Anjan?
Anjan, forget it. Don't do anything.

561
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:23,624
Look, everything is going to work out
on its own. Don't do anything. Leave it,

562
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,161
Anjan. No need to do anything.
Everything will be fine on its own.

563
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:28,289
Don't do that, Anjan. Anjan, don't.
- Take a look.

564
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,233
Check all of these.

565
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:32,302
Come on, check.

566
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,408
It isn't there. It is not among these.

567
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:52,514
In that case...
- What is it?

568
00:51:53,257 --> 00:51:55,623
The whole office is
playing a game with you.

569
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,057
He is not alone in this.

570
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,898
Do something to make everyone aware...

571
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,024
...that even if a sheet of paper is moved
away from its rightful position...

572
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,069
...how difficult it can be.

573
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:08,596
What should I do?

574
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:13,038
Create mayhem!

575
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,044
Don't do that, Anjan.
- What are you scared of?

576
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,272
Anjan. Please stop it...
- Destroy everything.

577
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:20,547
What are you doing?

578
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:23,511
What are you so scared of?
What fear do you have?

579
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,187
Are you scared of society?

580
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,614
Of police?
- No, Anjan.

581
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:30,182
Or are you scared of losing the job?
- No. Don't do that.

582
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,026
One cannot live with so much
of fear in mind, Abhi.

583
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:38,234
If you have to live with your head held
high, You must give a befitting reply.

584
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,467
You must be a rebel.

585
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,367
Nothing happens on its own, friend.

586
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:46,641
Go ahead.

587
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:57,144
Do it.

588
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,920
Come on. Break it.

589
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:40,254
Hey, what is this? That is my table.

590
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:20,727
No, no, Anjan. No, no. Leave this.

591
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,433
Who is it? Who is it?
- Who is it? Who is it?

592
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:30,700
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Let us run.

593
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,878
Who is it inside?
- Come on, let us run. Come on.

594
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:42,344
Run, run, come this side.

595
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:45,988
Hey, stop. Stop.
Who is it? Who is it?

596
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:47,317
Come this side. Upstairs.
- He has gone upstairs. Come on. Upstairs.

597
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:49,484
Hey, who is it? Get hold of him...
- Come on, get hold of him.

598
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:52,752
Hey, stop. Stop. I am warning you.
- Stop. Stop.

599
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,196
Hey, this is closed.
Come on. Let us go that side. That side!

600
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:58,166
Come on...
- Hey, they have gone that side.

601
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:01,762
Come on, come on.
- Get them. Get them.

602
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:06,400
Hey, stop. Hey, get them. Get them...
- There they are. Come on, get them.

603
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:12,138
Hey, stop. Where are you running off to?
- Make it fast.

604
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:16,447
Hey, stop. Hey, get them. Get them...

605
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:54,285
I didn't get that file.

606
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:56,821
We will go there tomorrow
again and find out.

607
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:12,734
Hey. I am sure there would be
a store room for old files.

608
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,405
Go and look for it there.
- Yes. Okay.

609
00:57:15,779 --> 00:57:18,213
And now?
- Now?

610
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,375
Go home. Even I will leave.

611
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:25,353
But where are you staying?

612
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,719
Grand Hotel.

613
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:32,561
Very good. But where can I find you?

614
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:35,393
Tell me the room number.
- 105.

615
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,160
Okay.
- I have taken a local number too.

616
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,666
Really?
- Yes.

617
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:44,638
Oh no. Yes, tell me.

618
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:50,208
9831060805.

619
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:52,548
60805.

620
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:53,742
Okay.

621
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:58,077
Okay, friend.
- Yes?

622
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:00,180
Tell me something.
- What?

623
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,423
You didn't even touch one table.

624
00:58:05,729 --> 00:58:07,094
Whose table is that?

625
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:10,359
Yes?
- Nandini's.

626
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,526
I see. I see.

627
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:16,569
Ladies, right?

628
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,007
I have a lot of missed calls from Aparna.
- Got it. Got it.

629
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:23,674
Taxi.

630
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,271
Hey. Hey!

631
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:30,480
Ballygunge.
- Sit.

632
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:35,281
I am leaving.
- Yes.

633
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:00,508
Hello?
- Abhi. Where are you?

634
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:02,642
I called you so many times.

635
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:07,416
I just saw the missed calls. GM sir had called
for a meeting today at his place. Urgent.

636
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:08,952
The phone was on silent.

637
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,384
Abhi. Is everything fine?

638
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:15,093
Everything is fine.

639
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:17,466
Where are you right now?

640
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,530
I am on my way. I am coming back home.

641
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:03,171
The world has changed.

642
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,233
It is one in the morning, Abhi.

643
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:37,907
I told you. The phone was on silent.
I couldn't hear it.

644
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:40,312
The phone was on silent
and you couldn't hear it!

645
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:41,475
So what if you couldn't hear it?

646
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:44,519
Didn't you feel like calling
even once and let me know?

647
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:47,621
I didn't get a chance. - What
do you mean you didn't get a chance?

648
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:55,091
Abhi. Everything...
- Everything is fine.

649
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:43,307
Want to say something?

650
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,415
We will not go anywhere
for the veneration holidays, Abhi.

651
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,251
In fact, Sumit and
I were talking about this.

652
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:59,419
We are never here for the veneration.

653
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,425
Ekdalia. Mohammed Ali Park.

654
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:07,669
We only hear others speak
about these veneration.

655
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:12,632
That is why we have decided
that we will stay here this year.

656
01:02:13,043 --> 01:02:14,806
We will see everything on our own.

657
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:19,314
And even I have some pending
payments after the veneration.

658
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:23,148
That is why there is no problem
even if we don't get the rent now, Abhi.

659
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:29,117
Really?

660
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,563
Everything will be fine, Apu.

661
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:41,667
Everything will be fine.

662
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:54,073
How are you?
- Fine.

663
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:56,482
Did you see?
- What?

664
01:02:56,586 --> 01:03:00,579
See how quiet he is?
- Yes, I do.

665
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:17,439
Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, leave me.

666
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:34,753
That is it.
That is it. That is it. That is it.

667
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:37,725
That is enough. Let go of him.
Leave him. Get up. Get up.

668
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:40,262
Hold your bag. Get up.

669
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:45,361
Great. What is your name?
- Rupam.

670
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:49,665
Look, Rupam. It is not a
big deal to stand ahead in queue.

671
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,172
Both of you will get seats.

672
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:54,504
But the point is that Sumit
comes before you everyday.

673
01:03:54,744 --> 01:03:57,144
So he has the right to
stand ahead in the queue.

674
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,080
But yet, if you feel being a senior,
you should stand ahead...

675
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:04,653
...you can request Sumit nicely
and he will leave the place for you.

676
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:08,751
But if you want to push around
and exercise your rights, then...

677
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:12,989
Then it will be a case
of Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

678
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:15,455
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

679
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,325
Sorry.
- Never mind.

680
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,126
Come on. Shake hands. Friends?

681
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:21,896
Yes.
- Yes.

682
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:23,131
Okay. Come on.

683
01:04:23,773 --> 01:04:25,400
See you in the evening, father.
- Bye, mother.

684
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:27,443
Come on, come on. Come on. Get up.
- Bye, bye.

685
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:31,597
I will not spare the fool!

686
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,972
I will bury him alive.

687
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:36,637
You have just managed to create
a ruckus. But we aren't scared, fool.

688
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:38,943
Fool. Lowly creature!

689
01:05:39,015 --> 01:05:40,915
Hey, let that son of a
scoundrel come in front of me.

690
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:42,178
Let him come and stand in front of me.

691
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:45,312
I will teach a lesson to the swine.
I will take each one to task...

692
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:46,582
Hey, keep quiet. Calm down.

693
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:50,183
Listen to me.
- That scoundrel wouldn't be spared!

694
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:56,626
Mr. Abhiroop Banerjee?

695
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:01,332
Can you tell us anything
about this vandalism?

696
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,670
CPI, CPM.

697
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:08,108
Congress. INTUC. TMC. BJP.

698
01:06:08,578 --> 01:06:11,240
I can't understand
whatever you are trying to say.

699
01:06:11,481 --> 01:06:13,711
I wanted to say that this
can be politically motivated.

700
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:15,579
Politically motivated?

701
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:19,916
But how? - Normally office
vandalism is politically motivated.

702
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:22,456
And it can be personal as well.

703
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,820
Maybe someone took revenge
for not getting the tender.

704
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:27,855
It could be done by kids as well.
- Kids?

705
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:29,654
I mean small kids.

706
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:31,266
Small kids?
- Yes.

707
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,334
They are the ones who love playing
like this. Spraying ink all over.

708
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:34,495
That is the reason
I am saying this.

709
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:36,861
Mr. Banerjee.

710
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:40,604
Your style of joking is very,
very interesting.

711
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:43,104
But there was an incident
in the office yesterday...

712
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:44,338
...and that had your involvement.

713
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:47,974
And because of that, it can be implied
that you had a motive to do all this.

714
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,153
Sir, in that case,
a lot of things can imply a lot.

715
01:06:51,254 --> 01:06:53,154
But they don't necessarily have it.
Like?

716
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:57,420
Like a fruit cake doesn't have fruit.
Sweet betel doesn't have sweet in it.

717
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,252
There is no milk in the milky way.

718
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,897
And in money plant(Coriander)...

719
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:09,535
That was a good one.

720
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,604
Come on. Finish it. Let us go home.
We will give them a surprise.

721
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:13,937
No. Tomorrow.

722
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:15,672
I have to meet someone today.

723
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:17,903
Who is it?

724
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:20,708
Madhurima.

725
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:22,351
Who is that?

726
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:24,912
You forgot?

727
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:26,854
Our Madhu.

728
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:14,828
Where did you find her?

729
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:18,304
At New York. JFK airport.

730
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:20,542
What does she do now?

731
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:22,740
She is in Kolkata.
She has a restaurant business.

732
01:08:25,415 --> 01:08:27,679
So that means you haven't
come to see the city alone.

733
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,786
I had been hurt very badly that day.

734
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:36,087
I thought that the memory
would live with me forever.

735
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:39,190
And now?

736
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:42,023
Now there is nothing.

737
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:44,696
So I can go ahead with her, right?

738
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:46,262
Absolutely.

739
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,304
Oh no. I am leaving.
- What is this?

740
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,339
You didn't even touch your drink.

741
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:56,375
I thought I will have it.

742
01:08:56,446 --> 01:09:00,382
But then, I thought I shouldn't
face a problem when I meet her.

743
01:09:01,617 --> 01:09:02,709
Waiter.

744
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:03,808
Let it be.

745
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:06,746
LIC worth quite a few lakhs.

746
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:08,685
Gratuity. PF.

747
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:10,821
And a house worth 10 crores.

748
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:13,892
I will pay the bill.
You can go ahead.

749
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,897
Wow! I can see that my
Royal Bengal tiger has woken up.

750
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,936
You are the real Royal Bengal Tiger.

751
01:09:25,608 --> 01:09:26,632
See you.

752
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:28,270
Hope you are coming
to my place tomorrow.

753
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:29,402
I will call you.

754
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,722
Now go and get your rent.

755
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,821
You will be able to do it, right?

756
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:51,957
I will be able to do it.

757
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,243
I told him that this particular
horse would win.

758
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,177
But he didn't listen to me.
- He is such a fool.

759
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:45,519
Come on. Let us have fun. You have won.
- Come on. Drink to your heart's content.

760
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:48,785
Hey, listen. I have been into
racing for the last fifteen years.

761
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:51,156
Yes.
- He is right. He is good at this.

762
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:54,219
What is it, Abhi? Want to have a drink?

763
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:06,705
You need to be civil here.

764
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:08,866
You have to stop doing all this here.

765
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,875
The rest of you. Get out. Come on.

766
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:15,778
Come on. Get out of here quickly.

767
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:20,352
Give me the rent.

768
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:24,257
Take this.

769
01:11:25,094 --> 01:11:26,083
This is the rent.

770
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:27,796
How?

771
01:11:28,397 --> 01:11:31,332
Hey, he called me on his own.
And he asked for forgiveness.

772
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,924
He was supposed to get a payment, right?

773
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:35,368
I think he has got it.
That is why he gave me the money.

774
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,531
Do you know what I think?
He was tensed.

775
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,100
Look, to err is human.

776
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:44,640
There is a saying you use for that.

777
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:47,545
In English. Burying or something...
- Bury the hatchet.

778
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:52,886
Abhi. Are you fine?

779
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,256
Does it seem to you
that I am not fine?

780
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,756
No.

781
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:03,256
You didn't go to
father's house that day.

782
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,498
Can we go there tomorrow?

783
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:09,404
No, Aparna.

784
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:11,433
Okay. Okay.

785
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,010
We haven't gone anywhere
for a long time.

786
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:19,044
It is Saturday day after. You
have a half day and Sumit has a holiday.

787
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:22,312
Can we meet you after
office and go somewhere?

788
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:26,311
We can go.
- Sumit will see us.

789
01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:28,857
I will ask Sumit not to come here.
What is it?

790
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,023
Abhi. Have you consumed alcohol?

791
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,928
No. Some office colleagues got
hold of me to treat them for promotion.

792
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:37,795
I just tasted it. I didn't drink.

793
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,396
Freshen up.
I will serve dinner.

794
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:48,465
Nandini.
- Tell me.

795
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:51,803
I called you many times yesterday.
But you didn't answer.

796
01:13:51,874 --> 01:13:53,307
I couldn't hear the phone ringing.

797
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,300
Or else, I would have
gone to your house today.

798
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,368
Thank God.
You didn't have to make an effort.

799
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:59,411
I will run an errand
today before I reach office.

800
01:13:59,515 --> 01:14:01,244
You can go to office on your own.

801
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,179
Want to say something?

802
01:14:32,715 --> 01:14:34,342
We are going to travel
back together, right?

803
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:36,610
Since I didn't come yesterday,
there is a lot of pending work.

804
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:37,743
Let me finish it.

805
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:15,317
Come on. Let us leave.
- Come on.

806
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:50,622
Aren't you leaving?

807
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:54,754
I told you. I have pending work.
I have to complete it.

808
01:15:55,998 --> 01:15:57,329
I will wait.

809
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:01,064
From now on,
I will not return by train, Abhi.

810
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,070
That is why there is
no point of waiting for me.

811
01:16:03,472 --> 01:16:04,302
Why?

812
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:24,187
Anjan.

813
01:16:28,597 --> 01:16:29,791
What is it?
- Yes.

814
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:31,094
Why didn't you come to the hotel?

815
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,861
No. You told me that Madhu
is in the hotel. So that is why I...

816
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,835
So what? You know her.
- Yes.

817
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,406
Anyway, what is the problem?
- I have fallen really low in the eyes of Nandini.

818
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:39,463
Very low.

819
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:42,776
Friend.

820
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:46,375
A blacksmith melts
the iron in fire and beats it...

821
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:48,348
...as per his wish to
give it a desired shape.

822
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:52,118
But the fire needs help
to keep itself burning.

823
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:54,211
The bellow.

824
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:57,291
Our mind's desire is the fire.

825
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,162
And in order to keep it burning, you have
to keep pumping air into the bellow, friend.

826
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:04,159
You are my support, Anjan.

827
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:06,565
But you are the blacksmith.

828
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,434
You are the one to hit with the hammer.

829
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,934
You have to solve your
personal problems on your own.

830
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:16,368
And you?

831
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:20,473
I am there with you.

832
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,491
Taxi.

833
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:39,198
Come on.

834
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:55,907
Move.

835
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:31,519
Let go of me! Let go.

836
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:03,412
You have to agree with our demands.
- You have to agree. You have to agree.

837
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:06,545
Let our revolution be hailed...

838
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,725
Hail. Hail.

839
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:19,427
Stop.

840
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:24,702
Hail. Hail.
- Hail. Hail.

841
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:27,867
Stop now. Stop.
Hey, where are you running off to?

842
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,443
Come here, you fool.

843
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:38,517
Abhi!

844
01:19:40,456 --> 01:19:43,357
Let go of me...
- Abhi. What are you doing, Abhi?

845
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,789
Let go of him.
- Leave me, Nandini.

846
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:48,091
Abhi. Stop it. Let us go. Come on.
- I will thrash him more.

847
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:51,132
Get into the cab. - Is it because of
them you were scared to travel by train?

848
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:53,599
Leave him... - For his sake?
I will teach him a lesson.

849
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:57,928
Come here, fool.
- Please leave him, Abhi.

850
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:01,203
Come here, Abhi. Leave him. - I will
not spare him. I will not spare him.

851
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:02,936
Let us go.

852
01:20:04,446 --> 01:20:06,073
Let us go. Come on.

853
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:22,123
What was the need to do all this?
Fighting on the street?

854
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,028
I couldn't even imagine
you would do this.

855
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,524
What has happened to you?

856
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:28,501
What were you thinking?
What were you trying to prove?

857
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,470
What are you trying to prove, Abhi?

858
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,368
Five into five.
- Twenty five.

859
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,332
Five into six.
- Thirty.

860
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:12,703
Five into...

861
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:19,876
Hello.

862
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:21,472
Is this Mr.
Abhiroop Banerjee's residence?

863
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:22,277
Yes.

864
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:25,787
Madam. I am calling from the
Park Street police station. Who is this?

865
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:27,981
I am his wife.
What happened? Tell me.

866
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:31,057
An unidentified
bag was found in Chowringee.

867
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:34,059
From the ID card inside,
we got the name and address.

868
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:36,222
Even a cell phone has been found in it.

869
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,424
Yes, yes, it is his phone.
Where is Abhiroop?

870
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:40,160
I don't know about that, madam.

871
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:43,568
Please ask him to come to the police
station tomorrow and collect his bag.

872
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:45,266
Yes. I will tell him. But...

873
01:23:16,305 --> 01:23:17,670
What is the matter?

874
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,965
You seem a little different.

875
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:23,836
Have you been thrashed or something?

876
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,445
Blow of the bellow.

877
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:39,416
I am very scared, father.
- No, no, there is nothing to be scared.

878
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:43,697
We called up at so many places.
He is so forgetful.

879
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,966
I am sure he has lost the bag.

880
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:49,629
He can lose the bag. But where did
the man go? He wouldn't get lost, right?

881
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:52,002
It is only 10:15 in the night, Apu.

882
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:55,668
Abhi is changing, father.

883
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:58,172
Why do you say that?

884
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:02,876
Look, he won't come to me.

885
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:05,818
I will come to meet him tomorrow or day after.
- Yes.

886
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:20,695
What is this?
What happened to you?

887
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:24,294
Nothing, Apu.
A car crashed hard into the taxi.

888
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,470
What are you saying?
I hope you are fine.

889
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,634
I am fine. Nothing to worry about.

890
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,204
Father. Check once.

891
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:31,336
What is the need?

892
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:34,347
This needs the specialty of general
physician or an orthopedic doctor.

893
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:36,015
It doesn't need a psychiatrist.

894
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:38,109
And both of them checked me
in the hospital.

895
01:24:39,187 --> 01:24:41,280
There was a phone call from
the police station, Abhi.

896
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:43,787
Your bag was found lying unattended.

897
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:45,019
Yes...

898
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:48,791
Yes. I guess it was at the time
when the car hit us.

899
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:50,957
It must have fallen out at that time.
I didn't realize.

900
01:24:51,066 --> 01:24:52,966
Where were you for so long?

901
01:24:53,268 --> 01:24:54,235
At the hospital.

902
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:55,868
It took so long?

903
01:24:58,006 --> 01:24:59,564
I had a colleague with me.

904
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,206
She was hurt a lot more.
So I had to drop her home.

905
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:02,640
That is why it took so long.

906
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:05,577
Nandini? I had called her
because I was so tensed.

907
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:07,874
What did she say?
- She didn't take my call.

908
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:08,847
Oh...

909
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,077
I see.

910
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:13,076
Which hospital?

911
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:15,514
PG.

912
01:25:15,891 --> 01:25:17,051
PG?

913
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:18,682
You went all the way
from Chowringee to PG?

914
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,819
There are so many nursing homes around.

915
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:22,993
I went there since it is
an authorized hospital of the office.

916
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:25,761
Strange.

917
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:31,003
I had called up at PG. But no, they didn't
mention any accident case on your name.

918
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,765
If you would have asked for Nandini Sanyal,
maybe you would have been informed.

919
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:37,304
Tell me, why do I have a feeling...

920
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:39,279
...that you are trying to interrogate me
again like before?

921
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:41,747
No, no, no, no.
I am not interrogating you at all.

922
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,181
Sorry. Sorry, Abhiroop.

923
01:25:44,586 --> 01:25:46,554
Apu. I am leaving today.

924
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:51,083
Yes, father.
- Abhiroop. Take care.

925
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:55,093
Why did you call him?

926
01:25:57,899 --> 01:25:59,799
I was worried, Abhi.

927
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:01,969
And what is the problem
if I call my father?

928
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:04,937
Didn't you see the way
he was interrogating me?

929
01:26:06,641 --> 01:26:09,701
Father wasn't interrogating, Abhi.
Even he was worried.

930
01:26:09,811 --> 01:26:10,835
Have you forgotten?

931
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:13,206
You had to leave your house
in one set of clothes.

932
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:14,976
You might forget it but I cannot.

933
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:19,819
This incident happened
so many years back, Abhi.

934
01:26:20,355 --> 01:26:22,585
Why are you raising old issues again?

935
01:26:22,691 --> 01:26:24,488
Even father has accepted you.

936
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:27,119
No, he hasn't.
Nothing has changed, Aparna.

937
01:26:27,429 --> 01:26:30,193
He interrogated me today in the same way
as he used to do earlier.

938
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:31,698
Nothing has changed at all.

939
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,290
Sorry, sorry.

940
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,531
Nothing has changed.

941
01:27:12,574 --> 01:27:15,566
Abhi. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Yes.

942
01:27:15,644 --> 01:27:16,542
What is the sweet for?

943
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:18,010
Hey, Dipankar has got a promotion.

944
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,877
Ranjit. Hey, Ranjit. Listen to me.

945
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:25,484
We have to increase the prize money.
There are so many teams now.

946
01:27:28,056 --> 01:27:29,455
What is the matter, Dipankar?

947
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:30,851
Why are you sitting on my chair?

948
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,459
It is the order of the GM sir, Abhi.
I have got a promotion.

949
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:51,235
Sir. Sir,
why is Dipankar sitting on my chair?

950
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:53,644
You will get an answer for this from
the vigilance either today or tomorrow.

951
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:54,647
Meaning?

952
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,545
Meaning!

953
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:59,553
I mean that you have cheated us of money
on the pretext of labor payment.

954
01:27:59,621 --> 01:28:02,283
12 lakhs in 6 months.
You are a lowly crook!

955
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:03,881
Sir. These are lies. Lies.

956
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:06,325
There is proof supporting your
lie in your computer.

957
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:07,892
All labor heads are fudged.

958
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,623
Sir, no, no.

959
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:18,302
'Hey. I am sure there would be
a store room for old files.'

960
01:28:18,373 --> 01:28:20,136
'Go and look for it there.'

961
01:28:22,644 --> 01:28:24,976
Abhi. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

962
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:26,970
What are you doing?

963
01:28:28,883 --> 01:28:31,579
Abhi. Abhi, calm down. Calm down.

964
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:33,245
Move away. Move.

965
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:45,760
Taxi. Taxi. Stop! Stop.

966
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:47,165
Grand hotel.

967
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:52,432
Yes, Rupam. Yes. How was it?

968
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:53,939
Sumit. Hang up.
- What are you doing?

969
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,441
One minute, mother.

970
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:56,066
What are you doing?

971
01:28:56,177 --> 01:28:57,508
No. Hang up now. Right now.

972
01:28:57,612 --> 01:28:58,476
What sort of deep friendship is this?

973
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,672
It is a holiday and you have not taken
a bath or eaten anything.

974
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:00,975
And you are stuck on
the phone for so long.

975
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:03,676
Sumit. Father will be waiting
for us without eating.

976
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:07,245
Okay. I am hanging up.
I will talk to you later.

977
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:10,052
Who is this friend of yours? What
do you talk to him about all the time?

978
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:12,183
Rupam. Mother, he is my new friend.

979
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:13,157
Who is Rupam?

980
01:29:26,608 --> 01:29:27,438
Yes, sir.

981
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,975
Anjan Sen. Room number 105.

982
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:30,476
Sir, just a minute.

983
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:35,416
And I thrashed him very hard.

984
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:37,474
Rupam held me from behind.

985
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:39,712
Even I held Rupam
and made him fall down.

986
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:41,949
And I thrashed him very hard.

987
01:29:43,324 --> 01:29:44,985
You have started fighting with people?

988
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,420
Father told me to do so.

989
01:29:46,494 --> 01:29:48,724
But now, Rupam and I are friends.

990
01:29:50,198 --> 01:29:51,756
Father told you to get into a fight?

991
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,528
Yes. Exactly.

992
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,668
Wait. I will be back.

993
01:29:59,474 --> 01:30:01,339
Since he is not here,
call him on his phone.

994
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:03,070
9831060805.

995
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,545
Please.
- This facility is only for the guests here, sir.

996
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:08,843
This is a five star hotel.
It isn't a PCO.

997
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:19,159
THE OBEROI GRAND.

998
01:30:56,030 --> 01:31:00,330
Hello. How are you? I am fine.

999
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:01,527
Yes.

1000
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:03,530
Grandfather has called.

1001
01:31:05,607 --> 01:31:06,266
Yes.

1002
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:08,035
I am on my way back from PG, Apu.

1003
01:31:09,177 --> 01:31:13,136
There was no case registered on
the name of Nandini Sanyal yesterday.

1004
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:17,752
And he hasn't collected his bag
from the police station as well.

1005
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,147
Father. I think Anjan has come back.

1006
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:22,083
My God.

1007
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,155
I am going to his office.
Please reach there.

1008
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:27,558
Take care.
- Yes.

1009
01:31:45,914 --> 01:31:47,814
What is it, Dipankar?
Why are you sitting here?

1010
01:31:49,184 --> 01:31:50,173
Now...

1011
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:54,649
Sorry. Actually I have got
a promotion, sister-in-law.

1012
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:56,153
And Abhi?

1013
01:32:08,436 --> 01:32:12,133
What is this? You don't even have
a semblance of injury on your body.

1014
01:32:14,542 --> 01:32:15,873
Meaning?

1015
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:20,043
Didn't Abhi and you meet
with a taxi accident?

1016
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:27,519
Abhi was with you last night, right?

1017
01:32:29,924 --> 01:32:32,586
Answer me. Tell me whether he was with you or not.

1018
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:42,165
He...
He was with me.

1019
01:33:09,898 --> 01:33:12,765
What shall I do now, father?

1020
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:18,569
I am brave.

1021
01:33:18,973 --> 01:33:21,203
I am a progressive and strong person.

1022
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:23,637
I am like a storm and I am a cyclone.

1023
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:26,703
I destroy everything that comes my way.

1024
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:29,409
I am ferocious.

1025
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:30,746
I am like an ailment.

1026
01:33:30,818 --> 01:33:32,581
I am like the fearless earth.

1027
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:34,781
I finish all the evils
that come in my way.

1028
01:33:34,856 --> 01:33:36,881
I am full of rage and
impatient all the time.

1029
01:33:37,558 --> 01:33:39,458
I am the rebel king Bhrigu.

1030
01:33:39,527 --> 01:33:42,462
I have the courage
to step on God's chest.

1031
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:46,662
I am the eternal warrior...

1032
01:33:47,502 --> 01:33:51,871
...who will always live
with his head held high.

1033
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:15,993
Get up, friend.

1034
01:34:37,685 --> 01:34:39,084
Father. Anjan is back!

1035
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:40,853
My God!

1036
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:46,156
Where will I look for
him in such a big city?

1037
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:51,858
Going by the graph, you should probably
look for him where Dipankar is.

1038
01:35:09,784 --> 01:35:12,252
Why aren't you taking
the matter seriously?

1039
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,515
Officer.
You better put your act together.

1040
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,216
Or else,
there can be a very bad incident.

1041
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:17,917
You better act now.

1042
01:35:26,134 --> 01:35:27,032
Who is it?

1043
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:35,142
Abhi.

1044
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:38,575
Have you just watched the movie Batman?

1045
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:42,212
Where is the file, Dipu?

1046
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:44,816
My God.

1047
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,282
You have watched a movie
and have consumed alcohol as well?

1048
01:35:51,592 --> 01:35:53,321
Where is the file, Dipu dear?

1049
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:58,130
Give me way.
There is point of speaking rubbish.

1050
01:35:58,232 --> 01:36:02,999
Hey, tell me. Where is the file?
Why are you getting scared?

1051
01:36:03,104 --> 01:36:04,571
Tell me. Tell me.

1052
01:36:05,173 --> 01:36:07,801
Scared. Of you?

1053
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:16,141
Tell me. Where is the file?

1054
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:21,952
I have made it vanish.

1055
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:24,553
What will you do?

1056
01:36:29,764 --> 01:36:31,129
Anjan.

1057
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:38,669
Because of this man,
I have been able to turn from...

1058
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:41,105
...a coward to a proper man. Right?

1059
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:44,073
You should give him a medal.

1060
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:48,609
You are too drunk.
- Yes.

1061
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:50,207
Go home and go off to sleep.

1062
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:06,394
Thrash the fool. Thrash him.

1063
01:37:46,174 --> 01:37:50,042
No, no. The file is in the wardrobe
storage of my house.

1064
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:52,909
I will give it back to you.
- Keep quiet, fool.

1065
01:37:53,014 --> 01:37:54,743
But please forgive me.

1066
01:38:02,323 --> 01:38:05,349
So who is this friend, Anjan Sen,
in reality?

1067
01:38:05,426 --> 01:38:07,621
Oh no. How many times should I tell you?
He doesn't exist.

1068
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:08,889
It is his imagination.

1069
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,141
Anjan. The lorry is waiting.
Let us go!

1070
01:38:38,259 --> 01:38:40,989
Just as he made your file vanish...

1071
01:38:42,463 --> 01:38:45,762
...make this fool vanish from the world.

1072
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,642
Have you ever heard of
a mental condition called Schizophrenia?

1073
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:59,008
Abhiroop suffers from it.

1074
01:39:01,249 --> 01:39:03,114
He was my patient at one point of time.

1075
01:39:03,217 --> 01:39:04,081
I know him.

1076
01:39:05,853 --> 01:39:09,721
This can have different
effect on various people.

1077
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:15,854
But in this case, whenever Abhiroop
is disturbed or depressed...

1078
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:19,761
...he needs a support system.

1079
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:24,430
And in case of Abhiroop,
Anjan becomes his support system.

1080
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,608
He is a completely fictional character.

1081
01:39:27,675 --> 01:39:30,405
But for Abhiroop, he is a living being.

1082
01:39:30,478 --> 01:39:35,006
A walking,
talking, laughing human being.

1083
01:39:35,116 --> 01:39:40,645
And it started when his parents died
because of a motor accident.

1084
01:39:44,558 --> 01:39:45,525
Leave me.

1085
01:39:45,626 --> 01:39:46,820
Abhi, leave me.

1086
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:53,662
Abhi. Abhi.

1087
01:39:58,706 --> 01:40:02,437
Oh my God. Abhi, please leave me. Abhi.

1088
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:14,043
No, no. Don't do this.
I am asking for forgiveness.

1089
01:40:35,843 --> 01:40:38,835
I am leaving, friend.
We shall meet again.

1090
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:57,087
A small kid used to
come on time every day.

1091
01:40:58,566 --> 01:41:01,034
And yet, he couldn't
stand ahead in the queue.

1092
01:41:02,436 --> 01:41:03,368
Why?

1093
01:41:05,206 --> 01:41:07,197
Just because the other
boy is more powerful.

1094
01:41:09,477 --> 01:41:10,569
What was the need?

1095
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:13,740
What was the need
to steal the office file?

1096
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:15,309
Yes?

1097
01:41:16,317 --> 01:41:17,875
What was the need? Tell me.

1098
01:41:18,786 --> 01:41:21,482
And bothering an
innocent girl like that?

1099
01:41:24,692 --> 01:41:26,284
Take revenge.

1100
01:41:26,427 --> 01:41:27,826
Do away with goodness.

1101
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:31,857
There is no place
for decency in this society.

1102
01:41:32,633 --> 01:41:34,624
If you want to live
with your head held high...

1103
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:37,803
...you have to live life on your terms.

1104
01:41:38,773 --> 01:41:40,001
I don't need anyone.

1105
01:41:40,207 --> 01:41:41,265
I don't need anyone.

1106
01:41:41,342 --> 01:41:44,334
I will live life on my own terms.
With my head held high.

1107
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:48,679
Hey, check the situation. The one who
cannot give respect to my wife and child...

1108
01:41:48,783 --> 01:41:50,341
...will be finished off.

1109
01:41:50,418 --> 01:41:52,682
I will finish him off.
- Abhi!

1110
01:41:52,753 --> 01:41:54,880
Move away. Get away from me.

1111
01:41:54,989 --> 01:41:57,514
Don't touch me. Go away. Not at all.
- Please go and inform the headquarters.

1112
01:41:57,591 --> 01:41:58,649
Hey.

1113
01:41:59,226 --> 01:42:03,287
I don't need people who cannot
give respect to me. Get lost.

1114
01:42:04,632 --> 01:42:07,897
Aren't you scared?
- What should I be scared of?

1115
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:09,265
They are the thieves.
They should be scared.

1116
01:42:09,336 --> 01:42:13,238
Go. Go away from me. I will
finish off everything. Everything.

1117
01:42:13,307 --> 01:42:19,212
He dared to cheat me?
I taught him a lesson.

1118
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:37,556
Get away from me. Move away.
Come on.

1119
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,538
Why are you laughing?
Keep quiet.

1120
01:42:54,448 --> 01:42:56,040
Abhi.
- Yes?

1121
01:42:58,919 --> 01:43:00,853
Don't laugh at all. Keep quiet.

1122
01:43:03,757 --> 01:43:05,190
You are still laughing?

1123
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:08,886
I am telling you. Keep quiet.

1124
01:43:09,897 --> 01:43:11,364
You are still laughing?

1125
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:38,954
Where can I find you?
Tell me the room number.

1126
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,584
105.

1127
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:48,198
Yes. Tell me.
- 98310.

1128
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:52,969
60805.

1129
01:43:54,842 --> 01:43:57,743
So I command a lot of respect
in your house, right?

1130
01:43:57,845 --> 01:43:59,745
A lot more than me.

1131
01:44:00,648 --> 01:44:03,640
Hey, you forgot? Hey, our Madhu!

1132
01:44:03,984 --> 01:44:05,144
What does she do these days?

1133
01:44:05,252 --> 01:44:06,947
She is in Kolkata.
She has a restaurant business.

1134
01:44:10,324 --> 01:44:11,916
Are you coming home tomorrow?

1135
01:44:19,867 --> 01:44:22,028
What is it?
Why didn't you come to the hotel?

1136
01:44:25,372 --> 01:44:26,566
And you?

1137
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:34,848
The son of a swine.
Let him come in front of me.

1138
01:44:48,062 --> 01:44:50,053
Wow.

1139
01:44:50,264 --> 01:44:52,892
I can see that my Royal Bengal tiger
has come alive.

1140
01:44:54,935 --> 01:44:56,562
You are the real Royal Bengal Tiger.
