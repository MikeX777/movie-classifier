1
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,744
There is an unholy
spell upon this village.

2
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,717
Our foolish greed

3
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,782
has dimmed our past

4
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,955
and darkened our future.

5
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:44,487
Yet there is nothing
to be done about it.

6
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,322
No one marries now in Piano.

7
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,359
No one falls in love,

8
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,743
or even dares to.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,142
Last night, as he lay dying,

10
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,571
the old man confessed
what he knew

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,631
and what he tried to do

12
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,147
to rid us of this curse,

13
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:11,143
that gypsy spell he wove.

14
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:13,528
I can bury a man,

15
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:15,987
but not his sins.

16
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:18,089
Whoa!

17
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,469
Tyler Hutton's office.

18
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:30,761
Yes, of course. I'll
tell him immediately.

19
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:34,902
Tyler?

20
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,760
Hey, Tyler, your dad wants you.

21
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,354
Are you okay?

22
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,137
Well, they finally came in.

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,557
The divorce papers, they're
so official looking.

24
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,214
Look.

25
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,534
I'm really sorry, Tyler.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,935
Okay, no, I'm not.
I'm glad, actually.

27
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,181
And you should be, too.
Megan treated you like...

28
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,383
So did you win?

29
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,884
She got the business,

30
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:18,250
what's left of it.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,392
And she got the car.

32
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,472
The nice one, too.

33
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,014
And she got the cat.

34
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,823
To be honest, I hated that cat.

35
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,633
He's waiting.

36
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:31,553
Move it.

37
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,466
What do you think
of this hemline?

38
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:40,563
Go for it.

39
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:41,991
And this?

40
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:44,885
Good.

41
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,090
Okay.

42
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,534
Okay, everybody, thank you.

43
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:49,193
Out.

44
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:50,632
Out!

45
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:52,208
Bye.

46
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,159
Sorry, guys.

47
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:54,779
Sorry.

48
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,313
What happened to you?

49
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:01,236
Pinched nerve.

50
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:02,843
Have a seat, Tyler.

51
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,451
I can't fly,

52
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,257
so I've decided to send you.

53
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,218
To Milan.

54
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,598
It's just a quick check
on the new spring lines.

55
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:15,332
By the way, you look like hell.

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,434
Thank you so much.

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,948
Handbags and boots.

58
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:20,974
You won't have to place any orders.
I'll do that.

59
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:21,980
You leave tomorrow.

60
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,428
Marta has your
travel arrangements.

61
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:25,290
Questions?

62
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:27,258
Yeah. You know, you might
want to send somebody

63
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:29,270
that's a little more up
to speed on handbags.

64
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:30,310
Look at me, Tyler.

65
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,527
How did a bed and breakfast
look good to you on paper?

66
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,599
Do we have to go
through this again?

67
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,835
I told you I made a mistake.

68
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,601
Why do you have to keep rubbing
it in my face all the time?

69
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:41,872
Because I don't want you to
forget the smell of failure.

70
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,761
Look, Tyler, I know
I'm partly to blame

71
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:46,734
for the way things are, but if
your mother hadn't poisoned...

72
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,435
She didn't poison anything.

73
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,567
We might've gotten to
know each other better.

74
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,525
But that ship has sailed.

75
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,034
What matters now is that you're
exactly where you need to be,

76
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,091
learning how to
run this company.

77
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,675
You just have some
catching up to do.

78
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,852
When did I ever say

79
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,534
that I wanted to
run this company?

80
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,390
You had your dreams, Tyler.

81
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,841
And what did they get you?

82
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,791
A messy, expensive divorce,

83
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,065
chapter 11,

84
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,639
and that... that stinking cat.

85
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:15,717
I didn't even get the cat.

86
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,730
Don't piss this
chance away, son.

87
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:20,433
You are gonna be
very, very successful.

88
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,762
And when you are,

89
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:23,043
you're gonna thank me

90
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:24,624
for kicking your butt
when you needed it.

91
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,278
Just get on that plane

92
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,675
and hit the ground running.

93
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,403
Got it?

94
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,303
Got it.

95
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,118
Bravo.

96
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:37,597
Gonna do it your way.

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,874
What have I got to lose?

98
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,368
You've got everything to lose.

99
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:51,738
Just a couple of details, Tyler.

100
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,614
First, window or aisle?

101
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:22,511
You look tired.

102
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,505
Are you sure you
don't wish to rest?

103
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,348
No, let's eat.

104
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:26,636
Let's talk business.

105
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,728
I like to hit the
ground running.

106
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,478
Driver,

107
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:31,997
Trattoria Del Vecchio.

108
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,052
And for you, sir?

109
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,040
Uh, what's good here?

110
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:41,016
May I suggest the
risotto Milanese

111
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:42,849
or perhaps the veal Milanese?

112
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:44,959
We'll do both.

113
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,806
Yeah.

114
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,020
Gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

115
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,609
Traffic was an
absolute nightmare.

116
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,993
Scusami, Paolo. Mr. Hudson,
I'm Hugo Galante.

117
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,880
Nice to meet you. Uh, Tyler.
Tyler is fine.

118
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:54,807
Have a seat.

119
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:56,899
So, what are we having to drink?
Do you want some...

120
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,544
wine? Red wine? It's killer.

121
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,074
Red wine is perfect, thanks.

122
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,719
-Yeah.
-Absolutely fine, thanks.

123
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,846
You see this thing?
What is that?

124
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,595
You know? It's,
like, where are we?

125
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,505
It keeps making me want
to go to the toilet.

126
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,049
That's weird.

127
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,027
Sorry.

128
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,252
Mm,

129
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,635
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to disagree with you guys.

130
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,894
I think that social media is
great and all that... but...

131
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,762
you really have to think about
the full-page magazine ads.

132
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,348
I mean, glossy things. That...
that's what sets fashion apart.

133
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,432
Yet your father's approach
was quite the opp...

134
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:35,954
My father.

135
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,503
was quite the opposite.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,715
He was always...

137
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,625
very quick to embrace
new technologies,

138
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:45,221
and he's done fairly well in
this billion-Euro industry.

139
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:46,889
Well, my father
isn't here, is he?

140
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:48,865
He's not around.

141
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:51,000
Look, I'll look at
your stuff tomorrow.

142
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:53,328
And if I like what
I see, I'm in.

143
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,243
Does anybody want another round?

144
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,925
-No, no, no.
-Come on.

145
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,859
No, it's my pleasure.
Don't worry about it.

146
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,621
It's not like I'm paying for it.

147
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,371
To the old man. Pops!

148
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,474
Mm, you know what I
really want to see?

149
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,421
I want to see boots

150
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,428
with a purpose.

151
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,945
Yeah. I'm talking
about actual boots.

152
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,504
Riding boots, cowboy boots.

153
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,126
Man, I'm talking
about authentic boots.

154
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:23,196
That's what I want to see.

155
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,184
It's gotta have life, purpose.

156
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,480
It's gotta mean something.

157
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:28,575
Am I right?

158
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,370
-Aw, come on, hey?
-Mm-mm.

159
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:34,826
Whoo.

160
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,697
That tastes like purpose.

161
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,439
Can you believe this guy?

162
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:45,906
Good night!

163
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,450
Crying out loud.

164
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,933
Hey, man.

165
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,713
Come on.

166
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,843
-Door's deceptively transparent.
-No, you did that.

167
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:58,178
That wasn't there
when I walked in.

168
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,952
-It was there.
-It wasn't there.

169
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,802
It was...

170
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,247
-Steady, steady.
-Okay, hey.

171
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,011
How much further is it?

172
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,922
It's really easy.
It's just right...

173
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,030
it's right around the
corner, I told you.

174
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,923
So we'll talk some
business tomorrow.

175
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,193
Come pick you up, yeah? Hmm?

176
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,866
Maybe we should just
get him a taxi, eh?

177
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,669
No, no. There's...
we don't need a taxi.

178
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,223
I told you. We don't have to do that.
I'm right here.

179
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,068
I told you it's right...
it's... no, no, no.

180
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,143
No, no, no. You guys are idiots.

181
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,282
It's over there.

182
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,080
-You sure?
-Yeah, no, I'm... I'm...

183
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,316
It's... I'm fine. I'm good.

184
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:30,899
I'll take it from here.

185
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,473
-Boots! Authentic boots.
-Boots.

186
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,015
He got his dad's looks.
He didn't get the brains.

187
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,109
There, that's him.

188
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,577
Mr. Tyler?

189
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,899
Come with us, please.

190
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,333
No, I'm okay.

191
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,335
I don't need a taxi.
Hey, hey, hey!

192
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,520
-Come on!
-Ow!

193
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,915
Wait! What's going on? Help!

194
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,582
-Hey! Hey! Help!
-Shut up!

195
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,626
You think maybe we should
have gotten him a taxi?

196
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,273
He'll be all right.

197
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,103
Faster!

198
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,154
Shut up or you go in the boot!

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,256
-Shut!
-What is it with boots?

200
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:10,752
Bambo, take A-4.

201
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,139
Do you have any idea who I am?
Ow!

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,828
We only know what
we need to know.

203
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,145
That really hurt.

204
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:17,704
That hurt my face.

205
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,484
And it hurt my neck.

206
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:30,770
The police!

207
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,763
Bambo, take A-4!

208
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,190
And do not stop for
anything except fuel.

209
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,809
Any possibility of food?

210
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:55,966
No!

211
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,373
-Bambo?
-Yeah?

212
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:02,746
Where the hell are we?

213
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,798
You tell me. You got the GPS.

214
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,689
Stupid thing doesn't
work in the rain,

215
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,786
and never in mountains.

216
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:14,135
Cetto,

217
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,735
what does the map say?

218
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:16,728
We have a map?

219
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,061
We are lost.

220
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,502
Lost? What do you mean lost?

221
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,649
You... you don't have a plan?

222
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,312
Of course we do.

223
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,967
We got a safe house
to stick you in

224
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:31,835
until we find out just how
much your old man loves you.

225
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,376
Aldo, do you think we
should be telling him that?

226
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,321
Shut up.

227
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,730
Look, there's someone.

228
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:53,520
Some old hag.

229
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,461
Pull over.

230
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,036
You stay down. Get down!

231
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,703
Go on, ask about rooms.

232
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,278
Mi scusi, signorina.

233
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,940
We are tired and hungry.

234
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,971
Mostly hungry.

235
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,351
Can you share with
us a place to sleep?

236
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:09,398
Share what?

237
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,347
A place to sleep.

238
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,968
I share my bed with no man,

239
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,711
and never three.

240
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,640
You fool! Signorina,
a room is all we ask!

241
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:24,411
A place to lay
our heads, please!

242
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,106
Bambo, let's go.

243
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:26,966
Let's go!

244
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:27,986
Get out of here.

245
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,608
Sit up, you.

246
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:34,356
Look, a village.

247
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,057
Where could we stay?

248
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,064
There.

249
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:48,683
That place.

250
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,511
It looks empty.

251
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:55,419
Do you think we could stay here?

252
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,132
We have no choice.

253
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,705
We have no mini bar.

254
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,263
Get our stuff from the
boot and take it up.

255
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,332
And take that idiot, too. Move!

256
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,187
Excuse me?

257
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,526
Um...

258
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,206
Oh, Madonna.

259
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:18,095
Oh!

260
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:20,848
Oh, Madonna.

261
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:22,927
Madonna.

262
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,950
Why?

263
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,129
Why you don't work?

264
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,142
Wait. Wait, wait.

265
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,516
Wait! Wait! Wait for me!

266
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,425
You're so beautiful!
Wait for me!

267
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:07,648
You're so beautiful.

268
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,576
You are the woman of my dreams!

269
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,109
Wait! Hey!

270
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,016
You are so beautiful!

271
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,412
Amore mio. Wait! Wait!

272
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,178
Mama Mia.

273
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,533
Mama Mia!

274
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:47,391
Hello!

275
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,165
Hello!

276
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:50,498
Hello!

277
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,373
Moo?

278
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,728
Ow!

279
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,323
Who are you? Who are you?

280
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,955
Why do you torment me? Idiota!

281
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,777
Ow! No, please help me!
I'm a prisoner.

282
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,508
I'm an escaped hostage!
Please help me!

283
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,045
Help you? Look
what you have done.

284
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,581
I say, look!

285
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:52,004
Leave me be.

286
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,215
-What? What?
-Leave me be.

287
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,164
No. Where are you going? Please.

288
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,422
Are you just gonna... just
gonna leave me like this?

289
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,213
Yes.

290
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,165
You can't just
leave me like this!

291
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,525
I'm sorry about your wagon!

292
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,198
Please, come back!

293
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,233
Who are you?

294
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:12,572
I'm Tyler.

295
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:15,275
Who are you?

296
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,653
I love you!

297
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,376
Good morning, my
magnificent staff.

298
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:26,553
Mr. Hutton, may I have a word?

299
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,428
-Morning, Mr. Hutton.
-Yes, you may.

300
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,161
Milan called. Apparently,

301
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,523
Tyler missed his
morning meeting,

302
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,058
and he never checked
in to the hotel

303
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,459
even though his bags are there.

304
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,593
Ah, damn kid. He must have gone

305
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,363
off backpacking or something.

306
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,333
Let's just, um,

307
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,706
give it a day.

308
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,893
Ow! Ow! Ow!

309
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,258
No, please! Please!

310
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,965
Ladies, please!

311
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,763
Where are you going?

312
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:28,769
Wait.

313
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,630
Wait! Wait!

314
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,582
Please, don't go!

315
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,778
Please! Please!

316
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:37,703
Sorry.

317
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,716
You are robbing the mayor!
Stop thief!

318
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:45,131
I will pay for this cow.

319
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,837
Not for all the
treasure in the Vatican!

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,495
Get out! Get off my land!

321
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,196
Ow.

322
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:17,909
Hey!

323
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:23,121
Oh, it is you! My friend.

324
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,105
What are you talking about?
You guys kidnapped me!

325
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,077
Well, we didn't mean to. Sorry.

326
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,288
You... you hit me.

327
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,326
Yeah, you. One of you did it.
It really hurt.

328
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,475
Uh, I remember.

329
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:38,478
I feel so ashamed,
now you mention it.

330
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,933
Oh.

331
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,032
Well, good.

332
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,418
I guess we're cool, right?

333
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,953
What are we doing
just standing here?

334
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,989
Actually, I'm trying to
find the woman I love.

335
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,709
I, too! Sort of.

336
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,159
That makes three of us.

337
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:54,748
Where's the other guy?

338
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:56,123
Don't ask.

339
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,997
Don't ask.

340
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,662
Why we are just standing around?

341
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,546
We need to talk about this,

342
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:06,913
but not here.

343
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,344
Let's go.

344
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:10,045
Hey.

345
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,603
You guys wouldn't happen to have
a spare toothbrush, would you?

346
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,059
Some underwear or...

347
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,655
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

348
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,492
I swear upon my family's name,

349
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,461
I never felt like this before.

350
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:31,356
What could it be?

351
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,305
All I know is,

352
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,480
Don Rossi will want to
see his ransom soon,

353
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,836
or see us dead,

354
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:41,360
but I cannot leave now.

355
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:44,799
But if Don Rossi
cannot find us...

356
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,080
I like it.

357
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:50,346
All in favour?

358
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,056
We stay!

359
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:12,408
Ahem.

360
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,001
Here we are.

361
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:15,264
Well,

362
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:17,286
you again.

363
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,442
Very well.

364
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,165
Sit where you can.

365
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,017
So,

366
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:36,529
what do you mean, you
are in a travel club?

367
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,044
What is a travel club?

368
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,601
We are like tourists, see?

369
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:43,396
But we make no plans.

370
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,241
We just, um, pop up.

371
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,155
Yeah.

372
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,138
And do you like our little town?

373
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,777
-Piano?
-We love it.

374
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,813
It's great, and the
wine is awesome.

375
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,950
-What do you call this?
-Fatto in casa.

376
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,866
Only the very best.

377
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:02,189
Uh, would you
happen to have milk?

378
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:03,417
Milk?

379
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,387
Cow milk?

380
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,451
-Milk for him.
-Hmm!

381
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:10,132
Can somebody, anybody,

382
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,681
please tell me,
who is that woman?

383
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,558
Her name is Rosalia Drago.

384
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:19,050
And, like her name,
she breathes fire.

385
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,547
I heard that, Nonna.

386
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,821
And I hear that you men
are planning to stay.

387
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:28,670
Why?

388
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:30,428
We're trying to find some work.

389
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:31,134
Mm-hmm.

390
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:34,721
So, what kind of
work you boys do?

391
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,924
I... I like fieldwork,

392
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,381
anything to do with asses.

393
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,932
You know, donkeys, mules.

394
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:48,203
My name is Pio.

395
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,833
You can work my place, yeah.

396
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,874
But do not say nothing

397
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,275
about my ugly niece.

398
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,981
No, no, no.

399
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,251
Me,

400
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,579
I like hard lobar.

401
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,687
The harder, the better.

402
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,686
My name is Robustelli,

403
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,528
and my son Rocco
can use some help.

404
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:13,324
Cows.

405
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:16,868
I mean, cow. Ju... just one.

406
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,113
I will let you clean, sweep,

407
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:20,750
maybe paint the barn.

408
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,970
But you stay away from my Nuta.

409
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,239
Do you hear?

410
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,633
I'm not really good at anything.

411
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,110
I can wash dishes

412
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:32,945
for you, if you want.

413
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,869
Wait, as a travel club,

414
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,691
you must obtain permits

415
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,307
to work in this village...

416
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,383
from me, the mayor.

417
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,957
And it will take one month.

418
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:46,368
One month?

419
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,537
-Maybe two.
-Oh.

420
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:54,656
Oh, God.

421
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:27,855
No, no, no.

422
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:34,329
What do you want?

423
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,057
Impossible.

424
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,988
Work permits are like gold,

425
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,853
and I am just a
simple village mayor.

426
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,551
It could take months,

427
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,013
as I told you.

428
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:48,895
Of course, of course.

429
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,610
But there are ways
to grease a pan, no?

430
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,598
Show me this grease.

431
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:08,488
Mama Mia.

432
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,225
Be careful!

433
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,413
You should be more careful.

434
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:59,455
Forgive me, Fedelia.

435
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,321
-Oh, I see you.
-Ooh.

436
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,089
Ooh, little puss.

437
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,363
I love furry things.

438
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:14,389
Do you, Aldo?

439
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,340
I, Aldo Lupo,

440
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,316
love everything you love.

441
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,615
Baby.

442
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,118
And when you finish with this,

443
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:19,937
mop the floor.

444
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,137
Cetto,

445
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:35,034
take care of Nuta.

446
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,868
See that she gets water.

447
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,824
Hey,

448
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:41,731
she trusts you.

449
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:43,778
That's good, Cetto.

450
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,092
Tomorrow, you'll milk her.

451
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,334
Me?

452
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,386
Mr. Hutton, you're
in awfully early.

453
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:02,947
I never left.

454
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:06,750
I got a call last
night as I was leaving.

455
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,861
Tyler's been kidnapped.

456
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,447
Kidnapped? Are you serious?

457
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,500
I need to send money.

458
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:13,962
They say they're gonna kill him.

459
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:17,013
I can't believe this.
The sheer stupidity.

460
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,302
Look out!

461
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:54,410
Look out below!

462
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,407
Whoo!

463
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:11,942
Well, good night, then.

464
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:16,657
Ciao.

465
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,279
Ciao, Tyler.

466
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:20,833
Wait, Tyler?

467
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:24,396
I wanted to say something.

468
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,133
Um,

469
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:26,829
I want to say thank you.

470
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:28,941
Thank you?

471
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,438
-Can I say something?
-Of course.

472
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,484
I have been in love with you

473
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,742
since the instant
that I saw you.

474
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,448
I know that we're working
together, and, uh,

475
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,350
I know nobody knows what
the future really holds,

476
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,393
-but I do know...
-Give me your hand.

477
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,140
Yeah.

478
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,131
Time for you to go home.

479
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,158
Okay. Okay, okay.

480
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:03,927
Can I ask you guys something?

481
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:04,700
What?

482
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:06,661
How much am I worth?

483
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:08,355
What do you mean?

484
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:09,441
Ransom-wise.

485
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,305
Like, how much does this...

486
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,712
Don guy want? A million?

487
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,247
Half a million Euros.

488
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,741
Don Rossi, you know, is
a very reasonable man.

489
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:20,780
Shut up, cow-boy!
You know nothing.

490
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:24,424
Besides, we all want
to stay here, right?

491
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:27,793
So why are we even
talking of ransom?

492
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,711
You're right.

493
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,801
It doesn't matter.

494
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:34,506
Nonna,

495
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:36,406
what do you make of that...

496
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,323
odd American?
The one called Tyler?

497
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:40,315
Oh.

498
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,181
The poor stupid boy.

499
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,079
He's under a spell.

500
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:52,907
I'm sure of it. I can
feel it when he passes.

501
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,461
So?

502
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,749
I mean, some say that
love can be like that, no?

503
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,743
Stupid?

504
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:03,979
Rose,

505
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:08,254
a spell is nothing to fool with.

506
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:13,358
How would you ever know
if his love is true?

507
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:17,733
More than anything,

508
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,357
you must protect your heart.

509
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,308
Okay, so, um, we got
off on the wrong foot.

510
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,054
Where is he going?

511
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,146
The cantina, I guess.

512
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,332
He's upset about Rosalia.

513
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,144
We had better watch him.

514
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:44,725
He might try to do
something stupid.

515
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,738
It could ruin everything.

516
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:48,654
Hello?

517
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:50,907
Hello?

518
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:53,299
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

519
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,858
Sorry.

520
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:56,426
It's a little dark in here.
I didn't see you.

521
00:32:57,212 --> 00:32:58,970
I'm saving my light bulbs.

522
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,114
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.

523
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:03,325
You're looking for my Rosalia?

524
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:05,466
She has no time for you.

525
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,673
Did she say that?

526
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,554
She's gone for firewood.

527
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,501
Each day she must find wood.

528
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:17,024
I tell her to leave
this sad place, but no.

529
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,941
She does everything for me.

530
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:24,172
We have little money, yet

531
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,237
she stays here in Piano for me.

532
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,804
Look, she's my Rosali.

533
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:32,905
Hmm.

534
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,878
I wish there was something
I could do to help you.

535
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,756
And I for you.

536
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:40,473
Excuse me.

537
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:41,842
The mayor.

538
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,964
Signora Corvo!

539
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,270
Your list.

540
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:53,436
Yes.

541
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,543
Hmm. Medicine?

542
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,987
-That is all?
-It is all we can afford.

543
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,423
Signora, I do not have all day.

544
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:05,855
Ah, these hands.

545
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,097
You see why I need my medicine?

546
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:09,365
Very well. I'm off.

547
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,315
Hey, wait. Wait!
Where are you going?

548
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,917
To the city, the big city.

549
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:16,335
What can I get for you?

550
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,462
Uh, actually, could...
could I come, too?

551
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,330
I'd like to pick up some, uh,

552
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:21,778
supplies and things.

553
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,483
How... how big is this...
um, this city?

554
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:28,255
Big! The selections
are unlimited.

555
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:33,157
Let's go!

556
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,994
Well, this is it.

557
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:32,479
My big date.

558
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:46,681
Sorry!

559
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:53,755
Rocco,

560
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,801
do you believe in spells?

561
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:01,695
My friends and I, you know,

562
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,790
we think perhaps
we are under one.

563
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,931
Could it be?

564
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,622
And if it could,

565
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:15,854
could it be that,

566
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:17,803
well...

567
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,691
without this spell,

568
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:21,953
without sarbolai,

569
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:23,759
you and me

570
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,943
would not be partners?

571
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:29,842
Oh.

572
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:32,718
Well,

573
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,521
that's for you to decide, Bambo.

574
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,630
Each man must know...

575
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:41,293
his own heart.

576
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:01,093
Oh.

577
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,466
Aldo!

578
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,245
Ah, there you are.

579
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,288
Yes.

580
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,377
You sound funny.
You catch a cold?

581
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:20,812
Si.

582
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,626
But, uh, no problems, right?

583
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,984
-Pronto.
-Perfetto.

584
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,645
I'll let you know when he's
ready to make the drop.

585
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:30,844
Si.

586
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,346
Okay, sit tight then. Ciao.

587
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:36,665
Ciao.

588
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,084
-Ciao.
-Funny.

589
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,970
Usually, I cannot
get that moron Aldo

590
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,220
to shut his mouth.

591
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,102
Something's wrong here.

592
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,432
Get the coordinates
of that phone call.

593
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,172
I want my money.

594
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,769
Hi there. Sorry I'm late.

595
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,893
I went into the city and,

596
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:05,800
well, that's why I wasn't here.

597
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,549
I got some presents.

598
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:09,420
I got this excellent
scrubbing pad.

599
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,286
I use it at home...

600
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,705
when I'm at home.

601
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,450
Um, I got, well, this
is a little something

602
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:16,717
that I got for your nonna.

603
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,617
Kinda lame, but...

604
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:21,252
who doesn't need light bulbs?

605
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,221
I thought they were...

606
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,062
Are you mad at me?

607
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,710
Well, that kinda sums it all up.

608
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,448
I'm just gonna

609
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:46,895
take my things and, um,

610
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,782
I'm gonna go then.

611
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:50,663
So, good night.

612
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:54,294
Ciao.

613
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,731
I'll, um...

614
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,216
What rhymes with 'romantic'?

615
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,856
You are writing another poem?

616
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,428
Yeah, for Rocco.

617
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:14,779
'Gigantic'?

618
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:16,885
Yeah.

619
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,443
Yeah, I can make that work.

620
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:25,351
Bambo, olive oil.

621
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,725
Perfetto.

622
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,613
Where were you?

623
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,997
Just some, uh,
travel club shopping.

624
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,337
Here,

625
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:35,193
catch.

626
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:35,736
Huh.

627
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:38,407
Cologne!

628
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,311
And some hand cream for Cetto.

629
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,874
What's with him?

630
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,775
Cetto, hand cream.

631
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:52,228
Just gonna leave it right there.

632
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:54,129
Hey,

633
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:55,673
you know what?

634
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:59,491
Maybe I, Aldo Lupo,
was wrong about you.

635
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,660
I suspected you might leave.

636
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,088
Rosalia's not going anywhere.

637
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:08,041
Why would I?

638
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:10,566
That's good.

639
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:22,527
Shh.

640
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,292
My love, Fedelia!

641
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,334
# Banyo #

642
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,406
'Banya.'

643
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:49,377
Banyo, that's what I said.

644
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,193
No, banyo, it's, uh, toilet.

645
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,446
Yeah, I know.

646
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,085
I thought we were
singing about a toilet.

647
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:55,709
# Banyo #

648
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:57,166
No.

649
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,381
I just heard the big news!

650
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,378
Your package has come!

651
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,033
I am going now to see it!

652
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,478
Tell Tyler!

653
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,203
Wait, Mr. Mayor, wait!
Wait for me!

654
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:13,458
Wait for me! Hold on!

655
00:42:16,645 --> 00:42:17,676
What package is this?

656
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:18,259
Huh?

657
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,490
Oh.

658
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:22,713
That guy.

659
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,028
I can never really understand
what he's talking about.

660
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,487
What have you done with my boys?

661
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:56,726
Okay, okay.

662
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,383
Talk to me then.

663
00:42:58,991 --> 00:43:00,068
Who do you work for?

664
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,753
Rosalia.

665
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:03,127
A woman?

666
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:04,317
Si.

667
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,812
Well, you can tell her

668
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:09,849
that I will mount
an army against her.

669
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:13,332
-Si.
-We have your coordinates,

670
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,748
and it's only a matter of
time before I find you.

671
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:16,992
And when I do,

672
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:19,106
I will hurt you both!

673
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,995
You and Rosalia! Capisci?

674
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,080
I do not play games!

675
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:47,161
So, even though
cultivation of lavender

676
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:49,534
would be new here in the valley,

677
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:51,469
it's being done elsewhere,

678
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,496
and there is money to be had.

679
00:43:56,874 --> 00:43:58,888
Everybody likes flowers, Papa.

680
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:03,644
Hmm.

681
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:05,882
Ah.

682
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,704
A partnership?

683
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:17,000
So this is why you two
are so inseparable.

684
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,785
My brother and I once,

685
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,522
we were like this.

686
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,169
Living together,

687
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,032
farming together,

688
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:28,954
until...

689
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:35,124
until he tried to
steal my lady friend.

690
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:38,031
That betrayer. That devil!

691
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:42,378
God help me, because
I still dream

692
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:46,024
of choking the life
out of that snake

693
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,390
with these bare hands!

694
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:49,259
Papa!

695
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,521
Papa!

696
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:54,197
It's okay,

697
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,031
it's okay.

698
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,509
And there will be
no lady friends

699
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:05,939
to come between us.

700
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:08,504
That I promise.

701
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,046
Hello?

702
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:26,185
Mr. Hutton,

703
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:29,467
sorry to disturb you
at such an early hour,

704
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:33,494
but I believe you have
been waiting for this call.

705
00:45:33,694 --> 00:45:35,500
Yes, I have. It's about time.

706
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,425
Where's my son?

707
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:39,126
With my men, and perfectly safe.

708
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:41,083
Let us talk about this money.

709
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,478
What's there to talk about?

710
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,649
I sent it just like
I was supposed to.

711
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,051
What do you mean, you sent it?

712
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:49,901
My son's email had very
detailed instructions,

713
00:45:49,962 --> 00:45:51,368
and I followed
them to the letter.

714
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:54,158
What email? Where
did you send it?

715
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:57,295
-I don't know.
-Because I do not have it.

716
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,809
Some place in Italy.
It's on my computer.

717
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:01,600
Either you're lying

718
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,453
or we have both been duped.

719
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:11,050
Hey, there.

720
00:46:12,435 --> 00:46:14,840
We are closed now. It's Monday.

721
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,981
I'm not really
here to do dishes.

722
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,665
Why are you here then?

723
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:23,510
Did you get my package?

724
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:25,642
Money.

725
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:27,572
You brought me money?

726
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,096
Your father, he sounds
so very successful.

727
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,313
Yeah, whatever, he is.
He's got a lot of money.

728
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:36,608
You... you...

729
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:37,923
I don't know,

730
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,072
you deserve the life of a queen.

731
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,474
Something is wrong with my life?

732
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:45,610
Well, no. No, no.

733
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:46,950
No. No,

734
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:48,695
It's not that. It's just...

735
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:52,663
Yes. Yeah, something is
wrong with your life.

736
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:54,332
It's too difficult here.

737
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:56,421
Your nonna, she can
barely afford medicine.

738
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,154
I mean, look, this
place is beautiful.

739
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:00,892
It's magical, but, come on.

740
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:02,593
Is that gonna be enough?

741
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,819
You've really, really, really
got to think about your future.

742
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:08,354
Think about all the cool
places you could go,

743
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:10,570
all the things you
could see and do with...

744
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:12,677
with me.

745
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:15,613
How much?

746
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:18,673
How much what?

747
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:20,213
Money. If you're
asking to buy me,

748
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:21,685
I want to know what I'm worth.

749
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:24,227
No, you're taking
this the wrong way.

750
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:24,882
I don't mean it like that.

751
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:25,925
No, Tyler,

752
00:47:26,478 --> 00:47:27,660
it is very clear.

753
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:30,062
You're attracted to me, yes,

754
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,156
and probably under a spell,

755
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,192
but that doesn't mean you
can chain me to your money.

756
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,559
That's not true!

757
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,761
I'll tell you the truth.

758
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:38,574
You, Tyler,

759
00:47:38,904 --> 00:47:40,169
cannot afford me.

760
00:47:41,452 --> 00:47:43,719
I have never yet
met a man who could.

761
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:47,649
The church has your money.

762
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,129
So,

763
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:17,702
you were abducted?

764
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:18,828
Kidnapped.

765
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,057
And they brought you here?

766
00:48:21,742 --> 00:48:22,519
By mistake.

767
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:24,108
I understand.

768
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:27,152
But if you're not being held,

769
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:28,679
why not leave?

770
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:30,499
I would.

771
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:33,656
I should, but...

772
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,162
I can't.

773
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:38,895
No.

774
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,726
It is because you are condemned.

775
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:43,855
-What? I'm...
-Condemned to love, Tyler.

776
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,072
You're under a spell.

777
00:48:50,238 --> 00:48:50,855
A spell?

778
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:52,198
Believe as you like,

779
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:54,088
it makes no difference.

780
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:56,251
Um...

781
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,047
The spell has you.

782
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,433
-Come on, Father. I...
-The spell has you.

783
00:49:03,928 --> 00:49:05,426
Okay. Um,

784
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:07,118
wow.

785
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,120
Okay, well, why don't
we say that you're right

786
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,822
and that I'm under a spell.

787
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,063
Um, can you, um...

788
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:15,072
can you do one of your...

789
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:17,295
exorcisms or something?

790
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,597
My son, an exorcism

791
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,762
can only cast out evil.

792
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:25,361
As for your money,

793
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:28,705
Rosalia does not want it.

794
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:31,405
She does not need it.

795
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:41,619
She asked me to
give it to the poor.

796
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:45,256
They are the poor.
Everybody here is poor.

797
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:45,976
Take it.

798
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,620
Do what you must.

799
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,305
But do not fool your heart.

800
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,877
Love cannot be bought.

801
00:49:56,686 --> 00:49:58,722
Money cannot break a spell.

802
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:05,033
Rosalia!

803
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:10,034
Rosalia, come on!
I'm sorry, all right?

804
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:12,372
I'm sorry about the money.

805
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:13,922
I'm not trying got buy you!
I'm just...

806
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:15,731
it's a symbol.

807
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:17,522
Look, look, look. The
money doesn't even matter.

808
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:18,683
I just want to show you

809
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:20,657
how much I care about
you, that's all!

810
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,942
This is all just a stupid
misunderstanding. That's it!

811
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,375
If you come downstairs, we...

812
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:28,349
we can talk about it.

813
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:54,147
Nuta.

814
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:04,895
For God's sakes.

815
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,838
It's just a cow.

816
00:51:08,618 --> 00:51:09,573
It's just a cow.

817
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,814
Nuta.

818
00:51:17,428 --> 00:51:18,431
Nuta.

819
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,807
Oh, Nuta.

820
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:28,037
No.

821
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:31,721
No, it's more than that.

822
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:50,839
What's going on?

823
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,745
Behold your Mayor!

824
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,479
Behold this cow!

825
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:06,584
Behold the beginnings
of a new day

826
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,971
in the greatest
village on Earth!

827
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,078
Piano!

828
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:14,041
You are drunk, you old fool.

829
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:16,907
-What's the purpose?
-The purpose, my friends,

830
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:20,627
will soon be abundantly clear!

831
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:21,826
Cetto, come here!

832
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:24,574
Ah, Cetto!

833
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,199
As you know, citizens,

834
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:34,212
Piano has suffered its
share of disappointment.

835
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:37,776
-Get to the point.
-Eh, the point.

836
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:39,862
The point is...

837
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:42,602
I am rich!

838
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:47,424
And when I am rich,

839
00:52:47,803 --> 00:52:49,697
Piano is rich!

840
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,389
And when Piano is rich,

841
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,745
she celebrates!

842
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,455
Let us celebrate

843
00:52:57,702 --> 00:52:59,984
the greatest festival

844
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:03,439
the world shall ever know!

845
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:08,039
The festival of Sarbolai!

846
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,542
Sarbolai!

847
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:13,743
Sarbolai!

848
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,579
Sarbolai!

849
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,047
Sarbolai!

850
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,180
And now for you, sir.

851
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,767
Adieu, Nuta.

852
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,274
My Fedelia,

853
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,467
I would like to
tell you something,

854
00:54:24,013 --> 00:54:26,302
something that has
been bothering me.

855
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:30,775
-I am not in a travel club.
-No?

856
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:31,723
No,

857
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:33,650
I am in another club.

858
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:36,743
It's name is famiglia Rossi.

859
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:41,592
You are Mafioso.

860
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:43,471
I was,

861
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:45,560
until I met you.

862
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,370
So, you do bad things.

863
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,673
Like I say, not now.

864
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:55,089
Not since I met you.

865
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:57,370
You changed me.

866
00:54:58,810 --> 00:54:59,841
Aldo, dear,

867
00:55:00,343 --> 00:55:01,854
you know I cannot love a man

868
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,590
who does bad things.

869
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,210
Oh, please.

870
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,501
I'm sorry.

871
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,333
Do not mention
this to Uncle Pio.

872
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,128
I will pray about it.

873
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,772
Thank you! Thank
you, my friends!

874
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,596
That's my boy!

875
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:43,828
Have you seen Rosalia?

876
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:45,142
We saw her leave.

877
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:46,833
Where did she go?

878
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:48,474
All we know is what she said.

879
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:49,762
Which was?

880
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,869
'We know nothing
about festivals.'

881
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:55,250
She took her big wagon.

882
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,611
She did not say where to or why.

883
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:00,147
Thank you.

884
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,726
Whoa! Ho!

885
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:32,498
Can I talk to you?

886
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:39,087
Can I please talk to you?

887
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,942
Rosalia, can I talk to you?

888
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:46,270
Hey. Hello.

889
00:57:46,552 --> 00:57:48,639
As you can see, I am busy.

890
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,424
My horses are thirsty.

891
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,811
Um, can I pretty
please talk to you?

892
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:54,558
Talk!

893
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:55,993
Why talk?

894
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,235
I know what you did.

895
00:57:59,235 --> 00:58:00,988
I understand everything.

896
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,571
You tried to buy me...

897
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:04,815
like a cow.

898
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:06,320
A cow!

899
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,629
Yes, yes.

900
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,784
But that was only for a minute,

901
00:58:08,845 --> 00:58:10,810
and I realize that
was wrong, and I...

902
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:13,743
You know nothing
about women, do you?

903
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:15,609
Or about love,

904
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,019
do you?

905
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:19,515
Obviously not.

906
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,080
You did a nice thing for Cetto

907
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:23,841
and the people of Piano,

908
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,714
and I would forgive
you if I could,

909
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,712
but I cannot.

910
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,675
Besides, you're crazy,
and you're under a spell.

911
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:33,838
Go away, Tyler.

912
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,227
Go away, Tyler.

913
00:58:41,504 --> 00:58:42,588
I'm not crazy!

914
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,479
And I'm not under a spell!

915
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:32,193
Those mountains up there,

916
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:38,907
once, they were covered
with cedar trees.

917
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,988
In my time, we
called them sarbolai.

918
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:46,228
We loved them,

919
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:49,146
but not enough.

920
00:59:49,573 --> 00:59:50,942
We cut them down.

921
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:53,336
The very last tree

922
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,845
was used to repair your cottage,

923
00:59:56,827 --> 01:00:00,138
and it was then that
our misfortunes began.

924
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:03,277
In this life, we
make many mistakes.

925
01:00:04,994 --> 01:00:05,755
That's for sure.

926
01:00:08,245 --> 01:00:09,696
Definitely made a few of those.

927
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,976
But I don't think me
being here was a mistake.

928
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,662
You know, part of me wants
to stay here forever,

929
01:00:19,723 --> 01:00:22,140
and the other half just wants
to leave, never come back.

930
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:27,098
There is but one answer.

931
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,228
You must break the spell

932
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:33,986
and find a way to win the love

933
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,730
of she who drives you mad.

934
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,087
Wait for a sign, foolish boy.

935
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,648
A single kiss will tell
you all you need to know.

936
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,101
How much farther is this?

937
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,379
How long you figure, Salvatore?

938
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,476
Uh, we are very close.

939
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:18,262
Aldo!

940
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:20,295
Come here.

941
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:21,484
Me?

942
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,740
-Aldo!
-You, you, you!

943
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:30,607
Aldo!

944
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:52,562
Come on!

945
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,976
Fedelia, come on!

946
01:01:56,986 --> 01:01:57,979
Jump in!

947
01:02:25,934 --> 01:02:27,105
Yeah!

948
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:37,189
And now,

949
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:39,730
Bambo! Ha, ha!

950
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,615
Hey, Bambo!

951
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:09,570
Bambo!

952
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:46,086
-He's my son!
-Thank you.

953
01:03:51,101 --> 01:03:54,826
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

954
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:58,098
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

955
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,933
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

956
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:20,164
Rosalia!

957
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:21,810
Rosalia!

958
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:03,098
Let's go, boys!

959
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,809
See ya... later!

960
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,687
See ya!

961
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:00,663
All my dreams come true.

962
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,300
Come on, Rosalia! Pick someone!

963
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,450
Me, me, me.

964
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:08,164
Send me a love that is true.

965
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,080
An ass?

966
01:06:19,128 --> 01:06:22,019
This is what the gods send
me when I make a wish?

967
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:25,650
They are so cruel with love.

968
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:26,879
Make way.

969
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:30,563
-Make way for the ass.
-Come on!

970
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:36,053
-Hello.
-You again!

971
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:38,265
Oh, were you expecting
someone else?

972
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,718
I thought I told you to go away!

973
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:49,084
Then why are you here?

974
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,092
You hit like a girl.

975
01:06:55,649 --> 01:06:57,647
What's the matter?
Can't you keep up?

976
01:06:57,807 --> 01:06:59,201
It's like I'm under a spell.

977
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:11,535
How about a kiss?

978
01:07:11,923 --> 01:07:13,670
In your dreams.

979
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:16,648
-Come on!
-You are insane!

980
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:17,948
Whoa!

981
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:23,785
Whoo!

982
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,691
You're not bad for a goat.

983
01:07:34,604 --> 01:07:36,712
Oh! Arrivederci!

984
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:39,142
-Whoa!
-Ha!

985
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:42,823
Whoo!

986
01:07:44,547 --> 01:07:46,768
-Woo hoo!
-Hey!

987
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:51,256
He is an ass!

988
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,134
Really?

989
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:23,677
Well?

990
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:34,731
You.

991
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:39,765
You broke the spell.

992
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,290
What... what in the name of...

993
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:04,281
All right, all right, all right.

994
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:07,413
Someone explain to
me this madness.

995
01:09:07,736 --> 01:09:08,453
Father,

996
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,859
it's me, Tyler. Remember?

997
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:11,086
The condemned one?

998
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:12,577
I brought a few friends,

999
01:09:12,638 --> 01:09:14,227
and we came here to be married.

1000
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,401
Are you drunk?

1001
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:17,184
Yes!

1002
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:19,429
-Rosalia?
-Yes, Padre?

1003
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:21,091
Did you break the spell?

1004
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:22,732
Yes, Padre.

1005
01:09:23,763 --> 01:09:26,342
-Very well.
-So do we, Padre,

1006
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,493
want to get married.

1007
01:09:29,606 --> 01:09:30,300
Padre,

1008
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:32,295
my partner and I,

1009
01:09:32,521 --> 01:09:34,054
we deserve nothing less.

1010
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:37,610
Wait. What about us?

1011
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:38,982
Are you all mad?

1012
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:42,251
Padre. It comes from above.

1013
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,635
A wedding here tonight?

1014
01:09:44,975 --> 01:09:45,989
You mean for who?

1015
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,490
My boy here?

1016
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:49,623
Yes!

1017
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,889
Why not? He's my son!

1018
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,513
-Bravo!
-And that's my son.

1019
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,879
And I am here...

1020
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:09,514
for one reason.

1021
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,481
Actually, two.

1022
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,556
Money and revenge.

1023
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,032
And I came for my son.

1024
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:19,889
So whatever it is you're doing,

1025
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:22,164
you can stop it now.

1026
01:10:23,141 --> 01:10:24,894
Tyler, what are you doing?

1027
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,421
I'm, uh, getting married.

1028
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:30,414
Uh, Dad, this is Rosalia.

1029
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:31,912
I have not time for this.

1030
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,477
Where is my money?

1031
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,395
Okay, I hate to break
it to you, Mafia man,

1032
01:10:36,456 --> 01:10:37,632
but your money's gone.

1033
01:10:38,732 --> 01:10:39,645
Seriously?

1034
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:40,506
Tyler,

1035
01:10:40,756 --> 01:10:41,744
have you lost your mind?

1036
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:42,905
Mm-hmm.

1037
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:44,089
Yup.

1038
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:45,946
Completely lost my mind.

1039
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:47,421
It totally ran away.
But now it's back,

1040
01:10:47,482 --> 01:10:49,666
and it helped me find
something else that I'd lost.

1041
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:52,587
I found my heart.

1042
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:57,518
So I send you on a simple
buying trip, Tyler,

1043
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,599
and this is what
you come up with?

1044
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,530
Dad, I'm sorry if
I let you down,

1045
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,652
but to tell you
the truth, really?

1046
01:11:05,419 --> 01:11:07,771
Purses, and totes, and
shoes, and all that stuff,

1047
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,523
it doesn't matter
to me, all right?

1048
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:11,875
And boots! Ugh! I hate boots.

1049
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:14,700
All that stuff, it
doesn't matter to me.

1050
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:16,813
It never has. That's
your world, Pop.

1051
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,516
I don't care about any of it.

1052
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:22,069
What do you care about then?

1053
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,038
You know, you asked
me that before

1054
01:11:25,099 --> 01:11:26,458
and I didn't have an answer,

1055
01:11:26,763 --> 01:11:27,789
but now I do.

1056
01:11:31,404 --> 01:11:32,217
Her.

1057
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:35,013
I care about her.

1058
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:38,060
And you, too, Dad.

1059
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,181
Despite everything,
I care about you.

1060
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:43,579
Son,

1061
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:46,003
please,

1062
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:48,506
just come home.

1063
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,159
We have business to run.

1064
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,948
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1065
01:11:57,934 --> 01:12:01,627
I know, I'd have everything
a guy could ever ask for.

1066
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,171
But then I'd just be under
another crazy spell, and...

1067
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:06,314
I'm done with those.

1068
01:12:10,466 --> 01:12:11,262
I pick her.

1069
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:19,280
You will give it all up for me?

1070
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:21,564
In a heartbeat.

1071
01:12:23,222 --> 01:12:24,516
Then I will marry you,

1072
01:12:25,752 --> 01:12:26,933
Tyler Hutton.

1073
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:29,543
Wait a second.

1074
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,616
You're both insane.

1075
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:34,879
Nobody move.

1076
01:12:35,604 --> 01:12:37,887
I'm taking my men and leaving.

1077
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,225
Aldo, Bambo, Cetto.

1078
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:46,236
Andiamo.

1079
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:48,360
-No!
-No.

1080
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:51,046
We are getting married!

1081
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,572
We are nice people now.

1082
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,550
-What?
-Si.

1083
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,047
And we are all in love.

1084
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:05,932
Father?

1085
01:13:06,212 --> 01:13:08,718
It comes from above!

1086
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,633
Who will give these brides away?

1087
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:15,598
You must stop this.

1088
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:16,529
So,

1089
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:21,368
let the weddings begin!

1090
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:45,700
Bacio, bacio, bacio,

1091
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:48,153
bacio, bacio...

1092
01:14:56,551 --> 01:14:59,395
Ah, bacio, bacio!

1093
01:15:12,982 --> 01:15:18,203
Bacio, bacio, bacio, bacio...

1094
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:26,029
How you doing? The happy couple!

1095
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:29,017
-Hey.
-I wish you all the best.

1096
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,440
-Oh, hey!
-Oh, oh, oh.

1097
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:33,356
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, watch me!

1098
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,475
Triple step!

1099
01:15:36,312 --> 01:15:37,426
Okay, well...

1100
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,673
Aah!

1101
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:43,323
-Hey!
-Okay, okay, okay.

1102
01:15:43,482 --> 01:15:44,994
We've had enough, okay?

1103
01:15:46,196 --> 01:15:47,210
Father,

1104
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:49,810
Rosalia, Tyler, everybody,

1105
01:15:50,176 --> 01:15:52,098
thanks for everything.
It's been quite a night.

1106
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,734
-So, good night.
-Bye-bye.

1107
01:15:53,795 --> 01:15:54,652
Good night.

1108
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,338
I'm not giving up on you two.

1109
01:15:56,612 --> 01:15:57,825
We're family now.

1110
01:15:58,448 --> 01:15:59,120
Stay in touch.

1111
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,111
More vino!

1112
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,756
Wait, I lost my hat.

1113
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,390
Where are you taking me?

1114
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:29,759
To the car.

1115
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,499
Where is my hat?

1116
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:37,734
Nuta!

1117
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,050
Nuta!

1118
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,649
Where are you?

1119
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,337
Why are you here all alone?

1120
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,242
I see.

1121
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:05,986
I understand.

1122
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:19,941
Hey.

1123
01:17:21,076 --> 01:17:22,665
What is your name?

1124
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:25,963
Yeah.

1125
01:17:29,531 --> 01:17:31,438
Want to be my friend, huh?

1126
01:17:49,805 --> 01:17:52,973
Hey, we can be
drinking buddies, huh?

1127
01:17:54,263 --> 01:17:55,531
Do you like milk?

1128
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,071
Hey!

1129
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:56,155
Where...

1130
01:18:56,677 --> 01:18:58,329
Where did you say you are going?

1131
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,909
Uh, we didn't. We don't know.

1132
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:01,277
We're in the travel
club, remember?

1133
01:19:02,298 --> 01:19:03,437
We just pop up.

1134
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,810
Will you be all right, Nonna?

1135
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,633
I will be fine.

1136
01:19:26,664 --> 01:19:27,611
Thank you, boys.

1137
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:31,751
Do not scratch my beloved car.

1138
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:04,738
Oh.

1139
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:06,867
Shoot.

1140
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:09,857
Rossi?

1141
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,599
What?

1142
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:15,266
We overslept.

1143
01:20:18,474 --> 01:20:19,286
Get up.

1144
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:26,233
Get dressed. I'll
meet you downstairs.

1145
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:46,615
Hello.

1146
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:50,908
Oh, yeah.

1147
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:55,732
Hello, you.

1148
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:01,838
Shall we?

1149
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,069
Si?

1150
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,218
Hello?

1151
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:23,163
Come in!

1152
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,574
Enter.

1153
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:28,649
I said come in!

1154
01:21:35,577 --> 01:21:36,325
Ciao, ciao.

1155
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:41,985
Oh, Madonna.

1156
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:01,497
Quiet.

1157
01:27:10,204 --> 01:27:12,146
And action!

1158
01:27:12,253 --> 01:27:13,947
Hyah! Hup! Hyah!

1159
01:27:29,599 --> 01:27:34,973
Viva Italia!
