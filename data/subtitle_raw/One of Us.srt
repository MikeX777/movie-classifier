1
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,360
Yeah, baby.

2
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah, yeah!

3
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,243
Yeah. I got spirit.

4
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,011
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

5
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>There's people at the door,</i>
<i>banging down the door.</i>

6
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,268
<i>And there's adult men outside.</i>
<i>I'm alone with my children.</i>

7
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,440
- <i>Do you know these people?</i>
<i>- They're my husband's family.</i>

8
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,110
<i>So you're having a family dispute.</i>

9
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,488
<i>No, I have an exclusion,</i>
<i>an order of protection.</i>

10
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,450
<i>The police just left a few minutes ago.</i>

11
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>They escorted my husband out,</i>

12
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,080
<i>and he called family and friends</i>
<i>to come bang on my doors.</i>

13
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
<i>And I'm alone with the children.</i>

14
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>This is very dangerous.</i>

15
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,195
<i>7:02, they got him served.</i>

16
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,326
<i>The minute he left, there's guys</i>
<i>with hammers around my house.</i>

17
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,205
<i>I took my kids to the bathroom.</i>

18
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,041
<i>It's the only room without windows.</i>
<i>And I called 911.</i>

19
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,587
<i>The whole neighborhood knows.</i>

20
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,301
<i>There's a religious law</i>
<i>that one Jew is never allowed</i>

21
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,763
<i>to hand any other Jew to the,</i>
<i>you know, authorities for anything.</i>

22
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,477
<i>I am breaking a religious law</i>
<i>if I press charges.</i>

23
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,248
<i>It wasn't my choice, this marriage.</i>

24
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,421
We met twice, 30 minutes.
Seven months later, we got married.

25
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,466
He was 18 years old, I was 19.
We never spoke, never saw each other.

26
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,759
He sat like this.

27
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,345
And I sat there.

28
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,349
And I didn't hear a word he said.

29
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,561
After 30 minutes, it was over. Done.

30
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,604
"When are we getting married?
Let's get a hall."

31
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,024
That was it.

32
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm invisible.

33
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,115
<i>We need to cover our hair</i>
<i>when we get married.</i>

34
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,745
<i>I was 18 years old,</i>
<i>and I had beautiful, black, thick hair.</i>

35
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,914
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I had to cut my hair off.</i>

36
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,085
<i>My mom came over to do it with me,</i>
<i>take all the hair off.</i>

37
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>For like almost a few months,</i>
<i>I couldn't look in the mirror.</i>

38
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,098
<i>As the years went by through my marriage</i>
<i>and I was having more children</i>

39
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,309
<i>and the abuse was escalating,</i>

40
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,102
his control became insane.

41
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,314
Friday night sex was mandatory.

42
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,107
Yeah.

43
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,653
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat,
couldn't walk, I couldn't leave my house.

44
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,741
I was hospitalized
for depression and anxiety.

45
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,830
I was trained motherhood only.

46
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,210
And the human being behind it fell apart.

47
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,323
- Hi, I'm Etty.
- Hi, Etty.

48
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,620
I lived 12 years with a spouse
who beat me, who yelled at me,

49
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,375
who embarrassed me, who really, like,
in every possible way broke me,

50
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,294
and I never responded.

51
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,545
I just had more babies.

52
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,966
I have seven children.

53
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,596
I was post-partum six years in a row.

54
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,269
I never questioned.

55
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,987
When you're married off at 18
and you start having babies right away,

56
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,116
and you have five by the age of 27,

57
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,872
and ten by the time you're 40 for sure,
where's the choice?

58
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,753
Like...
I don't see choice there anywhere.

59
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,299
I don't have any other choice.

60
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm jumping into something insane...

61
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,516
and I'm terrified.

62
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,383
<i> The Hasidic community</i>
<i>has a story about Footsteps.</i>

63
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,680
<i>And that is that we come into</i>
<i>the community and we take people out.</i>

64
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>But we're not out</i>
<i>to make people not religious.</i>

65
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,937
<i>That's not our mission.</i>

66
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,317
Nobody leaves
unless they're willing to pay the price.

67
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,196
And the price for freedom is really high.

68
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,577
<i>Community is your family.</i>

69
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,790
<i>If you're sick, somebody will show up,</i>
<i>take care of your kids.</i>

70
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>Food will be brought to you.</i>

71
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,461
<i>You'd be driven to the hospital</i>
<i>if you can't do it.</i>

72
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,879
<i>You're never alone.</i>

73
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,382
<i>There's so much help,</i>

74
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,262
<i>and there's a huge appeal</i>
<i>to always being helped.</i>

75
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,143
<i>You lose all that when you leave.</i>

76
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,346
All the ladies, please go to the ladies.

77
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,307
All the men, on the street, to the men.

78
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,473
What made you decide to do it?

79
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,979
- Didn't want to live the lie.
- All right.

80
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,773
Didn't want to live the lie.
I was living a lie.

81
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,693
I was pretending
to be something that I wasn't.

82
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,737
I thought about it already for a year.

83
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,450
I decided it's about
damn time, and... I did it.

84
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,914
It's not appropriate
for you to stand here.

85
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,624
You should be standing alone.

86
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,782
<i>I didn't feel like</i>
<i>the person I looked like.</i>

87
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>I looked in the mirror and I saw something</i>
<i>that-- this is not what I want to be.</i>

88
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>So I chose a different path.</i>

89
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,968
My friends that I grew up with

90
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,388
are not responding to me
when I say, "good morning" to them.

91
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
Many of my old friends.

92
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,642
-And they recognize you?
-So...

93
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,145
-Yeah, people I went to school with.
-Mm-hmm.

94
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,815
They don't want any <i>shichus </i>with me,
any connection with me.

95
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,613
A lot of people that clearly know me,
but just ignore me.

96
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:50,371
It's a human failing. It's a human failing
of not tolerating, uh, the black sheep.

97
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,791
But is it so unique? Is it oppressive?

98
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,377
Humanity is oppressive.

99
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,839
People have to fit in and shut up.

100
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,927
Why? Because this is the nature of humans.
You belong to a group.

101
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,762
There's groupthink.

102
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,224
And if you're a little bit of an outsider,

103
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,394
people are just gonna walk away from you.

104
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,606
I get yelled at for asking questions.

105
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,483
It's been bothering me.

106
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,279
I have a lot of questions
that I asked a lot of people.

107
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,490
-The existence of God or...
-Yeah.

108
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,535
-That's what troubles you.
-Yeah. It's-- It's...

109
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,078
I think--

110
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,623
I feel that if I would have an answer
on a lot of the stuff that...

111
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,668
A lot less anxiety.

112
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,505
In the Hasidic way of looking at things
is we don't delve

113
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,926
into the depth of philosophy,
"Does God exist?" and...

114
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:51,807
The Hasidim are more about what you do
and doing it repetitively.

115
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,058
This is the way Judaism always--

116
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,019
-For me, it's never working.
-It doesn't work for you.

117
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,645
Okay, it's not working.

118
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,566
Well, it probably--
It's working for many thousands of years.

119
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,044
<i>People are entering a different world.</i>

120
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,967
<i>Like the fly who enters the web</i>
<i>of the spider.</i>

121
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:32,139
<i>There are those who are already ensnared.</i>

122
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,810
<i>We are here to heed the call of the...</i>

123
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,229
<i>...spiritual leaders of our nation...</i>

124
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,232
<i>...who have recognized and identified</i>

125
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>the dangers of the Internet.</i>

126
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:51,241
<i>Something that threatens</i>
<i>our continued existence as the...</i>

127
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,660
...<i>people of God.</i>

128
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:59,291
<i>I've seen with my own eyes</i>
<i>people giving children of 11 years old</i>

129
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,754
<i>Blackberrys, and iPhones, and iPods!</i>
<i>Are they out of their minds?</i>

130
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:10,427
<i>Dear Jews, dear brothers, dear sisters...</i>

131
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,097
<i> ...what is happening to us?</i>

132
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,975
<i>Who are we becoming?</i>

133
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>- The nation...</i>

134
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,442
<i>...should deteriorate into a people</i>

<i>of yentayachna.com.</i>

136
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>For years,</i>

137
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,788
<i>"We can't stop this, we can't stop this."</i>
<i>Retreat and retreat and retreat.</i>

138
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,083
<i>We can no longer retreat.</i>

139
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>we draw the demarcation line in the sand,</i>

140
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,382
<i>and from now on, we're going forward!</i>

141
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,727
<i> I remember being there.</i>

142
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,939
<i>I was about 13.</i>

143
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>It had an impact on me.</i>

144
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,781
<i>It was like when I kind of knew</i>
<i>what the Internet was</i>

145
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,075
<i>but hadn't figured out its full potential.</i>

146
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,622
<i>But I really wanted to check it out</i>
<i>one more time.</i>

147
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>So I just-- I clicked on it.</i>

148
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,046
<i>Google? What the hell is that?</i>

149
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,174
I couldn't Google how to Google,

150
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,217
I didn't know how to Google
in the first place.

151
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,721
So, yeah, that was tough.
The first breakthrough was that.

152
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,059
<i>So I would just go on websites,</i>

153
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,062
<i>search for random stuff.</i>

154
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,400
When I found out that there's Wikipedia...

155
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,445
When I found out
that there's something Wikipedia,

156
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,280
I was the happiest person alive.

157
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,408
I could search for anything,
and they have a whole article:

158
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,620
how it works, how it's made,
who made it, when it was made.

159
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,747
That was amazing.

160
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,791
Wikipedia was a...

161
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,588
a gift from God. I don't know.

162
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,173
Wikipedia was a gift from God.

163
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,550
Yeah.

164
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,015
<i>I'll-- I'll be completely honest</i>
<i>right now.</i>

165
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,141
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

166
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,728
I don't know the basics of math.

167
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,482
Never went to college, high school, no.

168
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:33,529
I was in Jewish schools since I was born,
since I went to school the first time.

169
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,573
I have to learn a lot of new things...

170
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,869
...starting with English,
which I think I kinda got.

171
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:47,918
And I also have to know how people live,
actually, in the world.

172
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,378
Like, how stuff works.

173
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,967
<i>The little stupid things</i>
<i>that I have to ask from strangers.</i>

174
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,597
<i>I show them a picture of my ID</i>
<i>and then ask how stuff works.</i>

175
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,819
<i>Let's stay to the left</i>
<i>to State Route 110 south,</i>

176
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,945
<i>Harbor Freeway.</i>

177
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>Stay to the left to State Route 110 South,</i>
<i>Harbor Freeway.</i>

178
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,497
I'm over this song.

179
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,792
This is way better.

181
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,472

189
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,042
You know what it is?
I feel less ex-Hasidic in L.A.

190
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,544
I feel more like a regular person,
less ex-Hasidic.

191
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,379
I think that's what it is.

192
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,924
I feel like just a dude.

193
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,678
Just a dude. I don't feel ex-Hasidic.

194
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,350
You know, I'm doing what everyone
else in L.A. is trying to do.

195
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,519
Try to get auditions
and, uh, get acting jobs.

196
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,480
Trying to survive.

197
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,151
So now I'm driving Uber
and, uh, doing, you know,

198
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,403
<i>driadlech</i>, as we call 'em.
You know what <i>driadlech </i>are?

199
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,948
It's a, you know...

200
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,786
You know?

201
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,457
It's not illegal. It's like, uh,
creative ways of making money.

202
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,685
All right, what else? Oh, shoes, shoes.
I knew I forgot something.

203
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,730
<i>You know, life is expensive.</i>

204
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,777
<i>So I live in an RV for free.</i>

205
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,658
I-- I don't speak publicly about--
about living here very much

206
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,328
because... it affects my image.

207
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,372
Not that I have an image,

208
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,916
but if I had one, it would affect it,
you know?

209
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,422
<i>I've been in L.A. for three years,</i>
<i>I've done nothing.</i>

210
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,674
<i>I-- I love L.A.</i>

211
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,053
<i>but, you know, when you get a part</i>
<i>to be in a TV show in New York, you go.</i>

212
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,225
I mean, just, like,
I don't find the point in, like, taking--

213
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm going to New York.
I'm not going to fucking Mars.

214
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,231
There's nothing I have here
that I can't get at Duane Reade.

215
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,727
<i>I've always been a performer.</i>

216
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,193
<i>My first acting job,</i>
<i>I found on Craigslist.</i>

217
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,946
<i>I searched "Hasidic," I searched "Jewish."</i>

218
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,283
All right, so I think we're gonna start...

219
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,827
<i>The plan was to keep the </i>payos
<i>and the beard,</i>

220
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,748
<i>and-- and corner the market</i>
<i>of Hasidic actors</i>

221
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,583
<i>and then break out from there.</i>

222
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,086
It's a good picture. I love it.

223
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,673
<i>That was the whole plan.</i>

224
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
<i>That was the whole hustle.</i>
<i>That was the whole idea.</i>

225
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,763
<i>Listen. Think about it.</i>
<i>It's a ridiculous plan.</i>

226
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,350
<i>It's a completely ridiculous--</i>
<i>It shouldn't have worked.</i>

227
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,247
-Hi.
-Hello.

228
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,290
-I'm Luzer. I'm one of the actors.
-Hello.

229
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,500
-Hi.
-How are you?

230
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,794
- Yeah, exactly.
- She says I need nothing.

231
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,046
- I mean... very little.
- Very little.

232
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,674
- You've got a baby face, man.
- Yeah.

233
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,426
All right. Here we go.
And action on rehearsal.

234
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
<i> I think movies</i>
<i>had the biggest influence on me.</i>

235
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:00,355
<i>When I was a young adult,</i>
<i>I used to go to Blockbuster.</i>

236
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,984
You know, I would look around,

237
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,404
make sure there's no minivans parked
in the parking lot, for example.

238
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,365
And I would buy these DVDs and stuff them

239
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,326
with the spare tire in the car
and come here.

240
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,789
I parked my car here at night
and watched movies in the car.

241
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,128
Until the cop came over to me one day
and asked me what I'm doing here.

242
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,755
And I said, uh, "I'm watching a movie."

243
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
"Why here?
Why don't you go home and watch a movie?"

244
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,011
I said, "I can't watch it at home."

245
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,055
He's like, "What are you watching?"
And I said, "It's a great movie.

246
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,099
It's called <i>Crossroads</i>
with Britney Spears."

247
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:46,067
You know, my excitement
for the secular world is based on movies.

248
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,737
My understanding is based on movies.

249
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,700
My-- My idea of fun in the secular world
is based on movies.

250
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,621
But when you--
when you look at the outside world,

251
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,122
your perception of it is wrong,

252
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,043
and then you go out and you realize
that, actually, if I leave,

253
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,878
I might have to work at McDonald's.

254
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,339
'Cause you don't have any skills.
What are you gonna do?

255
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,342
They have designed the society

256
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,511
where you're unable to make it
in the outside world.

257
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,556
They've designed the world
where if you leave it, your only way--

258
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,393
the only way you can survive
is by being a criminal.

259
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,562
Everybody who leaves, they say--

260
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,525
Everybody who leaves eventually comes back
or they end up in jail or in rehab.

261
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,527
But they never--
they never make it out there.

262
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,250
<i> Dear Jews,</i>

263
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,505
<i>in critical times like this,</i>

264
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:56,972
<i>go out and show that you care</i>
<i>for the future of your kids.</i>

265
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,063
<i>Go out and vote for a candidate</i>
<i>that understands</i>

266
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:10,026
<i>that our rights come from God</i>

267
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,487
<i>and not from government.</i>

268
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:22,080
<i>Please don't waste</i>
<i>your precious vote by staying home.</i>

269
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,678
"<i>A father will walk the streets</i>
<i>with a jacket."</i>

270
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,893
<i>"A mother will demonstrate complete</i>
<i>adherence to the guidelines of modesty."</i>

271
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,899
"Parents will never read
any secular-oriented books."

272
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,653
"There may be no Internet access
in any area of the home."

273
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,117
"Children will never enter
a secular library for any purpose."

274
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,414
<i>That's a lot of rules.</i>
<i>So many, so many, so many rules.</i>

275
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,251
<i>Everything is controlled by the rabbis.</i>

276
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,382
Well, I take baths in the morning,
you know that?

277
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,925
I know, but only today.

278
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,678
<i>So my son who's in second grade</i>

279
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,181
finished this reader,

280
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,810
and it's a <i>chasidish </i>reader, means
all the <i>chasidish </i>schools are using it.

281
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,312
Check out all the girls.

282
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,606
They went through with Magic Marker.

283
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,986
Female, scribble, female, scribble.
Male, male.

284
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,781
I'm surprised they're not putting on
a yarmulke on those.

285
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,285
How did my son circle this answer?
"Sally trips."

286
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,870
How did he know which was which?

287
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,547
Reading and the education
is so deprived of the community.

288
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,426
That's how they keep their control.

289
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,951
<i>You're nasty.</i>

290
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,540
<i>Something is driving you.</i>

291
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,463
<i>- You have something against...</i>
<i>-  ...God and Judaism.</i>

292
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,138
<i>The way I see it, you're shooting a gun</i>

293
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,766
<i>and shooting yourself</i>
<i>and the kids as well.</i>

294
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,564
<i>I'm asking you</i>
<i>to stop harassing me now.</i>

295
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,236
<i>No problem.</i>

296
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,448
<i>No problem. Do whatever you want.</i>

297
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:21,152
<i>I broke the rules</i>
<i>because I wanted a divorce, essentially.</i>

298
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,325
<i>The community makes the decision</i>
<i>that this man is a man in need.</i>

299
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>They hired hotshot lawyers that were known</i>
<i>as winning cases in similar situations,</i>

300
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,378
<i>specifically for Hasidic men.</i>

301
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,844
<i>I don't have the proper lawyers</i>
<i>to fight this because I have no money.</i>

302
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,306
<i>They're just waiting for me to fall apart</i>
<i>and walk away.</i>

303
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,103
<i>None of this seems surprising to me.</i>

304
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,151
<i>The Hasidic community</i>
<i>has figured out a way</i>

305
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:30,531
<i>to look at the secular laws</i>
<i>and to find ways to make it work for them.</i>

306
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,246
<i>There's something in custody cases</i>
<i>called status quo.</i>

307
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,917
And what that means
is they want the children

308
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,543
to have a consistent lifestyle.

309
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,922
So whatever the kids had before
should continue after the divorce.

310
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,886
<i>The Hasidic community is so insular,</i>

311
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,390
that anything outside of it
becomes outside of status quo.

312
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,312
The food you eat,
the way you tie your shoes...

313
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,524
Everything becomes status quo.
It's the way the community works.

314
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,692
And so...

315
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,030
<i>this status quo argument</i>
<i>is what Etty's up against.</i>

316
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,546
<i>Who was there?</i>

317
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,965
- <i>My mom.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

318
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,300
<i>Two of my sisters, my brother-in-law...</i>

319
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,386
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- ...my uncle.</i>

320
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,932
<i>And here they are testifying against me.</i>

321
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,018
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

322
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,437
<i>My upstairs neighbor,</i>

323
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,691
<i>she did a whole petition</i>
<i>about everything she knows about me,</i>

324
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,861
<i>every single thing I ever told her.</i>

325
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,654
<i>And we're close like sisters.</i>

326
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,281
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

327
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,744
<i>Like, I take my daughter</i>
<i>to the public library,</i>

328
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,537
<i>and she reads secular books.</i>

329
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,709
<i>She was like, "Etty let her kids</i>
<i>watch a movie on this and this date."</i>

330
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,504
<i>Oh, my gosh, Etty, that is a horror story.</i>

331
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,593
<i>I looked her right in the eye</i>
<i>and I told her, "You betrayed me.</i>

332
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,596
<i>And I cannot talk to you ever again."</i>

333
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,044
Yeah.

334
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,421
- Do you speak Yiddish?
- Yeah.

335
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,632
In this park,
is there free Wi-Fi?

336
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,426
Not free, but I can
give you Wi-Fi from my phone.

337
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,845
No, no, no. I'm just asking.

338
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,431
I see a lot of kids around here.

339
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:05,812
There's free Wi-Fi at this-- at--
at this corner of the park.

340
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,732
Sometimes there's free Wi-Fi.
There's free Wi-Fi all over.

341
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,025
All over.

342
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,903
You can't really stop Hasidic boys

343
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,822
from having free Wi-Fi in Brooklyn.

344
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,741
It makes boys hang out around here.

345
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,244
That's why they put up
the spotlights there, no?

346
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,413
Does that really help?
The boys come here anyway.

347
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,334
- You can't really stop 2015 progress.
- No.

348
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,171
-You know that? All right.
-Yes, yes.

349
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,756
Are you one of us?

350
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,927
- Yes.
- Where did you go to Yeshiva?

351
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,931
Queens. Satmar Boys School,
then Satmar Yeshiva.

352
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,182
Ari Hershkowitz.

353
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,060
How long have you looked like this?

354
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,521
My hair?

355
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,484
About a year.

356
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,364
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

357
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,034
- You are 18 years old?
- Yeah.

358
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,250
You could use this place to repent.

359
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,526
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>I got into a dark place.</i>

360
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,616
<i>I ended up taking too much cocaine.</i>

361
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,577
<i>Ended up in the hospital.</i>

362
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:34,252
<i>And, like, a week or two later,</i>
<i>I overdosed on cocaine again.</i>

363
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,550
<i>I asked my dad if he's angry with me,</i>

364
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,011
<i>and he said something...</i>

365
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,347
really nice.

366
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,599
He said that, in his words,

367
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,227
"It's not you who did it,
it's the addiction inside you."

368
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,064
He was-- He was very understanding.

369
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,937
<i>What have I done?</i>

370
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,858
<i>Have I ever hurt the children?</i>

371
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,155
<i>Have I attempted</i>
<i>to make the children not religious?</i>

372
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,865
<i>Never.</i>

373
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,874
<i>It's not about religion.</i>

374
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,977
They terrify me.

375
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,064
They put on the stand
the guy who was following me

376
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,232
for the past few months.

377
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,401
<i>What?</i>

378
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,405
<span style="style_1"/>They can see exactly what I'm doing.

379
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,492
They know when I leave,
they know when I come back.

380
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,664
Today, I left my house
with my bike in the morning.

381
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,542
When I came back,
he's taking pictures of me.

382
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,797
He hates the bike.
He told my kids he's gonna get me.

383
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,678
I can't take this man anymore.
I can't take it anymore.

384
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,515
This is not normal!
This kind of control is sickening!

385
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,352
There's no reason why, in New York State,
this is legal to be controlled like this.

386
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,441
<i>Twelve years, I kept my mouth shut,</i>

387
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,693
<i>and I'm not keeping my mouth shut</i>
<i>anymore about this.</i>

388
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,561
<i>I can't hide anymore.</i>

389
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,692
<i>I can't go back into, you know, hiding.</i>

390
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,362
<i>I can't do it anymore.</i>

391
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,410
I don't think it would have selfish
to leave the marriage

392
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,329
if everything would have been fine
for my kids.

393
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,081
Yeah.

394
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,422
<i>We don't talk about domestic violence.</i>
<i>We don't talk about hitting kids.</i>

395
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,551
<i>We don't talk about sexual abuse.</i>
<i>It's not done.</i>

396
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,765
There's no law here. It's not like...

397
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,104
this whole attitude law doesn't affect us.
My husband kept saying that all along.

398
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,481
"No one's ever gonna remove me
from my home. It's my place.

399
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,024
The law doesn't affect me."

400
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,734
I kept telling him,
"You're hurting the kids.

401
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,445
Police can get involved."
"They can't do anything to me."

402
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,074
It's this kind of attitude.
Law doesn't come in here.

403
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,955
This is exactly the opposite
of what you're allowed to do.

404
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:09,628
To publicize our secrets,
our beautiful secrets.

405
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,798
The beauty of Judaism
is just being private and quiet

406
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,967
and keeping everything under cover.

407
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:22,099
This can't go on. It can't be
that we're living in New York...

408
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:26,645
I'm this kind of person that can't stand
for this kind of behavior

409
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,397
and this kind of covering up.

410
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,859
<i>It's so wrong. It's so wrong.</i>

411
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,111
<i>Wrong, wrong, wrong.</i>

412
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,182
<i>"In the forest</i>
<i>where I hid, I found a dog at night.</i>

413
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,604
Sick, hungry, and perhaps also crazy.

414
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,693
I fell on his neck and cried like a child.

415
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,073
It wouldn't be a surprise
if I were to say that at that moment,

416
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,491
I was jealous of the animals.

417
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,329
What I felt was more than jealousy.
It was shame.

418
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,458
It was shame. I was ashamed for the dog
that I was not a dog, but a human."

419
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,668
Stop.

420
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,130
I was ashamed for the dog.

421
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,090
Can you dig what he's saying here?

422
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,968
Yeah.
I was ashamed to be a human.

423
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,847
You have to take
your time and let it sink in for you.

424
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,103
But I want you to take this piece.
I wanna give it to you.

425
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,855
I would love to do it.

426
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,190
I'm trying to figure out
how I can be bi-coastal.

427
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,153
- It's difficult.
- It's hard.

428
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,534
How old were you when you got married?

429
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,702
Nineteen.

430
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:51,915
How long were you married?

431
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,041
Three years.

432
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,751
Children?

433
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,006
-How many? One, two?
-Two.

434
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,427
Do you still see them?

435
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,764
Not really. No, I, uh, walked away.

436
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,349
You never see them?

437
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,312
You know what?
Listen. Here's the thing, okay?

438
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,065
I would've spent the last eight years
in courts.

439
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:21,653
And, uh, defending myself
and defending my lifestyle.

440
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,655
- I don't wanna do that.
- Let me ask a question.

441
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,824
So when the character
talks about his kids...

442
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,783
Yeah?

443
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,998
Can you use your experience
with your own to-- to, uh...

444
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,750
I do. I use it all the time.

445
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,464
Um, I have plenty of shit to mine
from my own life.

446
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,051
I have my childhood,
which was very abusive.

447
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,720
You know, and, uh, very dark.

448
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:52,518
And I have my, uh, my marriage
and my children, who I don't see.

449
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:57,147
That's why I can't have
relationships. I don't want relationships.

450
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,108
I don't want drama in my real life.

451
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,153
In real life, I am perfectly well.

452
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,698
In real life, I don't have any children.
In real life, I never lost anyone.

453
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,992
Okay.

454
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,972
<i>What happened</i>
<i>was that I was living a double life</i>

455
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,808
<i>for a little over a year</i>
<i>while I was still married.</i>

456
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,019
<i>And she decided to keep quiet about it.</i>

457
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,733
After a year,
she realized that I am not changing.

458
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,527
That this is not a phase.

459
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,946
That I'm-- I'm heading
in a different direction.

460
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,531
So she went and told her dad.

461
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,950
And that was it.

462
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,746
Within a matter of days,
everything came crashing down.

463
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
And you have to understand
that nobody knew anything.

464
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,755
Nobody knew
that anything was wrong at all.

465
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,467
And I called my mom and I said,
"Hey, Mom, can I talk to you?"

466
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,178
She was like, "Yeah."
I was like, "Are you sitting down?"

467
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,849
And she said,
"Yes, I'm in bed. I'm laying down."

468
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,143
I said, uh, "I got divorced."

469
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,564
She's like, "What? Why?"

470
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,193
And I said, uh, "I wasn't happy,
and also, I'm not religious anymore."

471
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,698
And...

472
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,826
...she said, "Okay."

473
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,998
She just didn't know how to handle it.
Then she just hung up.

474
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,792
And then we didn't speak for seven years.

475
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:44,838
That was it.

476
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,467
Nope. Or my dad.

477
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,003
God bless.

478
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,881
I just wanted to tell you that today,
I have 100 days clean.

479
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,388
By the way, it's my 19th birthday.

480
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,269
All right. Good night. Love you, bro.

481
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,740
<i>I definitely learned a lot in here.</i>

482
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,787
Well, I have shorts now.

483
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:07,421
Yeah, I just went shopping and...
I don't know.

484
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,843
I remembered a Vine that I saw
that says cargo shorts are cool.

485
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,055
So, yeah.

486
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,724
I had an option of basketball shorts.

487
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,727
Not really my style,
so I went with cargo shorts.

488
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,103
They have a lot of pockets.

489
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,362
<i>As far as I know,</i>
<i>my dad had to spend a lot for rehab.</i>

490
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,451
<i>And I am very lucky, I know that.</i>

491
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,334
I just spoke to them maybe once or twice.
I think only once.

492
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,545
Maybe twice,
for the whole time I was here.

493
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,091
Like, they were nice,
but there's not much to talk about.

494
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,219
Except my tiny sister. Two-year-old.

495
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,223
She was figuring out how to talk, so...

496
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,809
She was like... "Hello."

497
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,896
"Good Shabbos."

498
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,280
So she's still pure.

499
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,590
<i>Traumatic experiences</i>
<i>happened to me in the community</i>

500
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,219
<i>that shouldn't happen to anyone.</i>

501
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:44,643
<i>It's one of the things</i>
<i>that I only told my therapist.</i>

502
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,734
<i>There's this organization</i>
<i>called Jewish Community Watch.</i>

503
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,404
<i>They have a wall of shame</i>
<i>on their website.</i>

504
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,742
And I went with my therapist
on that website.

505
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,912
We checked out the wall of shame
to see if I could recognize someone.

506
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:09,626
And one of the pictures I saw there
was my principal in summer camp

507
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,127
when I was...

508
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,799
eight years old-ish.

509
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,260
He was my principal at summer camp

510
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,555
and he's on that wall of shame
with a whole thing.

511
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,894
<i>And everybody saw this.</i>

512
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,230
<i>They were peeking in the windows,</i>

513
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,026
<i>all the kids together</i>
<i>standing outside of the building.</i>

514
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,531
I ran out of the building, he chased me,
all the kids watched this.

515
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,537
<i>And I was raped and beaten up.</i>

516
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,543
<i>But, basically, the summer camp told me,</i>

517
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,839
"Nah, you're just thinking--
no, it was probably something else.

518
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,926
He slipped and fell on top of you,
I guess."

519
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,851
Those people are still working
at that summer camp.

520
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,398
Never convicted,
never charged with anything,

521
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,817
never went to prison,
probably still doing it.

522
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,819
Yeah.

523
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,326
Or some people say,
"You were a wild kid, you deserved it."

524
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,702
That happened sometimes.

525
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,915
So for a long time,
I thought I deserved it.

526
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,438
- <i>♪ How old are you now? ♪</i>
- Are you 24?

527
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,190
My goodness.
Will you let me open my eyes?

528
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,149
Okay, open!

529
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,859
<i>♪ How old are you now? ♪</i>

530
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:02,656
-Wow! This is so gorgeous.
<i>-♪ How old are you now? ♪</i>

531
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,117
<i>♪ How old are you now? ♪</i>

532
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:12,123
Are you 24? Are you 25?
Are you 26? Are you 27?

533
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,461
-Are you 28? Are you 29?
-Keep going.

534
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:21,007
Are you 30? Are you 31? Are you 32?

535
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,928
-Can I make a wish?
-Yes.

536
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,304
One, two, three.

537
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,558
Thanks very much.

538
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,186
Happy birthday. Thank you so much.

539
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,107
Thank you so much.

540
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,359
This is the best birthday party
in the whole world.

541
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,780
- Mama, take this. Take the chocolate.
- Okay.

542
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,032
Mama's gonna take it in a minute.
I'm getting plates.

543
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,909
Don't put your fingers in. You gotta wait.

544
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,036
Stop. No touching fingers.

545
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,455
Can look from here.

546
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,919
Thank you so, so much for the present.

547
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,619
<i> How many people here</i>
<i>are looking for a job?</i>

548
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,333
We are all here looking for a what?

549
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,419
A J to the O to the B, right?

550
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,837
Yes, sir.

551
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,672
We all need a job. That's the similarity.

552
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,009
Man, how can we help each other get there?

553
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,513
Sometimes, it's your own family.

554
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,391
I'm not asking you
to stop talking to your family

555
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,560
or stop being around people that you love,

556
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,980
but one of the things in this process
is you have to start circling yourself

557
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,774
with people who are positive,

558
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,650
who are doing something
a little bit different

559
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,319
than what you used to do.

560
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,752
<i>I used to walk on the streets</i>
<i>of Manhattan and feel like...</i>

561
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,796
<i>I don't belong here.</i>

562
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,885
I really want to be part of a bigger world
and be able to, like, go to school,

563
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,720
be able to get a job in the secular world,

564
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,597
be able to have the choices
I want to make.

565
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,769
<i>I want my children to have every chance</i>

566
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:42,023
<i>that anyone else has</i>
<i>who grew up in a stable environment.</i>

567
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,193
<i>Feeling love.</i>

568
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,784
Mommy!

569
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,119
Ma, let's go.

570
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,005
Why do kids need this much stuff? Lord.

571
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,149
<i>Do you know who called me yesterday?</i>

572
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,568
<i>No, I don't know.</i>

573
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,571
<i>Your husband.</i>

574
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,451
<i>He spoke to me,</i>
<i>and he's ready to sit down.</i>

575
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,288
<i>He has no interest to fight in court.</i>

576
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,165
<i>He wants to settle.</i>

577
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,751
<i>But this man is an abuser.</i>
<i>I will not sit down with him.</i>

578
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,338
<i>Let's get to the point.</i>

579
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:52,343
<i>The court is gonna be</i>
<i>a benefit more for him than for you.</i>

580
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,096
<i>The courts do everything</i>

581
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,307
<i>in favor</i>
<i>of the religious parent community.</i>

582
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,769
<i>I want you to understand something.</i>

583
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,815
<i>The community will never,</i>
<i>never, never... </i> ...<i>give in.</i>

584
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,321
<i>They don't want all</i>
<i>seven children to be modern.</i>

585
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,784
<i>The rabbis told them</i>
<i>to fight this until the very end.</i>

586
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,206
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

587
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,831
<i>What's the matter?</i>

588
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,834
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

589
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,466
<i>Is somebody there</i>
<i>that's not supposed to be there?</i>

590
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,596
<i>No, I was outside on my bike</i>
<i>and a car knocked me down,</i>

591
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,515
<i>and I don't know what happened.</i>

592
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,687
<i>Somebody knocked you down?</i>

593
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,023
<i>This wasn't an accident.</i>

594
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,735
<i>He told my son twice this week</i>

595
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,405
<i>that he's gonna get me</i>
<i>and knock me down on my bike.</i>

596
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,158
<i>He said he's gonna do this to me,</i>
<i>and he did it.</i>

597
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,871
<i>They're just gonna kill me</i>
<i>to get rid of me, and that's it.</i>

598
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,036
Etty, what are you thinking?

599
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,085
What are you doing
to take care of yourself?

600
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,424
Try to live a normal life.

601
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,893
What you're going through
is extremely difficult,

602
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,479
and really hard and unfair.

603
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,524
-It's not me, it's my children.
-It is you too.

604
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,610
It's not me.
I'm an adult, I can deal with it.

605
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,779
It's my kids who have no idea
how to deal with it.

606
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,197
And I have to hear that.

607
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,743
Every day is hell.

608
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,954
Why am I going to court?

609
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:13,002
Because if you don't show up
in court, then you lose the case.

610
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,339
And not only do you lose the case here,
you lose the case in appeal.

611
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,675
This is why you're going to court.

612
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,677
It's a sham.

613
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,263
I hate to tell you this,
I'm working on a case right now

614
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,224
where it's a very similar situation.

615
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,809
Her kids were taken away from her

616
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,186
and she got so fed up,
she stopped showing up to court.

617
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,814
Do you know that no one
can appeal her case?

618
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,375
<i>The community truly believes</i>

619
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,544
<i>that they are saving the souls</i>
<i>of these kids.</i>

620
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,297
<i>That's the way it is.</i>

621
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:09,100
The Hasidic community that exists today
is an answer to after World War II.

622
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:15,523
And so it's an entire community
built on survivors,

623
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,525
with trauma,

624
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,985
and they bring that in.

625
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,031
<i>So now these kids now belong</i>
<i>to whom, to the parents?</i>

626
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,409
<i>Or to the six million that died?</i>

627
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,663
<i>The children are the community's property</i>

628
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,793
<i>These souls were brought into the world</i>
<i>to rectify something,</i>

629
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,756
<i>and that is their driving force.</i>

630
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,361
She's kind of cute, actually.

631
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,787
See that open door over there?
That's where I used to live.

632
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,331
It's my first apartment
after I got married.

633
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,876
My ex-wife moved when we--
when we-- after the divorce.

634
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,796
She moved right around the corner.
I wonder if she still lives there.

635
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,013
That's my brother-in-law right there,
with the hat.

636
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,767
He can't see me. He hates me.

637
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,020
He's very, very religious.

638
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,321
Oh, my God, that's my friend.
He runs a check-cashing business here.

639
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,322
Wait a second.

640
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,746
What are you doing here?
Coming back for a visit?

641
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,623
Yeah, I live in Los Angeles.

642
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,085
You have a life?

643
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,379
Yeah, surprisingly enough, I do.

644
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,840
I'm a different person.

645
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,884
Let's put it this way, I've mellowed.

646
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,639
Listen, I try to be-- I'm not an asshole.

647
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,975
Yeah, I understand. Not a problem.

648
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,561
- You know, I've never been an asshole.
- You know, I...

649
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,729
- I don't know about that.
- Okay.

650
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,523
But we're not going there.

651
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,984
-Do you care if I'm happy or not?
-Yes.

652
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,444
I told you then.

653
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,322
That's why we can be friends.

654
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,075
That's why we can be friends.

655
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:34,662
I'm not gonna judge what world you're in.

656
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,542
Whatever path you take
and what you decide,

657
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,462
let Him deal with it.

658
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,589
Mom's challah.

659
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:28,758
Orgasmic.

660
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,093
- Not there.
- We don't want...

661
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,803
- All I want.
- This is something.

662
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,680
- This is, you know, home.
- Yeah.

663
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,265
It's home.

664
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,061
- <i>L'chaim.</i>
- Cheers to that. Cheers.

665
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,730
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>

666
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,817
<i> L'chaim.</i>

667
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,872
How about you get this?

668
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,280
Okay, let's leave
everything out and just come into it.

669
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,283
This is amazing. Join it.

670
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,494
- This is the best thing ever.
- The best thing ever.

671
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,827
<i>I do miss it, this communal experience.</i>

672
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,039
<i>I don't think I'll ever stop missing it.</i>

673
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,253
<i>But the more of a seeker you are,</i>
<i>the more of a questioner you are...</i>

674
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,715
<i>the more likely you are to leave.</i>

675
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,474
<i>So I recently asked my friend</i>
<i>who's still in the community...</i>

676
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,852
Like, I asked him, "So why..."

677
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,898
You know,
"Why-- Why do you ostracize?

678
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,025
Why does the community ostracize?"

679
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,195
You know, and his argument was like,

680
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:57,448
"This is how we are able
to maintain the community.

681
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,200
This is the only thing that works,
you know?

682
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,035
Before that, we had Germany.

683
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,204
They weren't able
to hold the community together.

684
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,914
The way that we designed it here,

685
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:09,043
the stringency, and the rules
and all these things,

686
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,754
that is why we're still here, you know?

687
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,839
That was the only way we could do it.

688
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,674
To rebuild after the Holocaust."

689
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:28,187
So it's, uh... it's complicated.

690
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:09,145
This is gonna take courage
for you to say, "God, I'm broken."

691
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,272
"God, I'm a mess."

692
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,316
"God, I need your forgiveness.
I need your redemption."

693
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,527
If that's you,
I'll ask you to put your hand up.

694
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,903
God sees your hand right now.

695
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,364
God sees your hands
as they are in the air.

696
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,160
Don't worry about what the people
next to you are thinking.

697
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,498
Right now,
God wants to do this work in you.

698
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,218
<i>I've always wanted to try new things.</i>

699
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,307
<i>I do want to learn a lot more</i>
<i>about other religions...</i>

700
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,980
<i>but now that I've tried it, then great,</i>
<i>what-- what can I try next?</i>

701
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,129
Try just blue on this one.

702
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,214
Okay.

703
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:22,384
This is a disaster.

704
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,764
- Love and hugs.
- Love and hugs.

705
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,184
<i>It's an awesome freedom.</i>

706
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:36,398
Everything that I'm not supposed to do,
I'm free to do it.

707
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:45,532
It's just great to just hang out
with friends, eat a burger.

708
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,700
Yes, with cheese.

709
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:57,044
After tasting this life...
eh, no, delete the old one.

710
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,049
Just out of my face, out of here. Yeah.

711
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,820
Ari, how are you?

712
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,822
God Bless.

713
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,366
You got blonde in Florida?

714
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:10,993
Yeah.

715
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,706
Are you completely done
with the program?

716
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:17,124
Yeah, all done.

717
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,251
Yeah. Over seven months clean.

718
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:23,797
- How about finding a job?
- I'm looking for that as well.

719
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:28,344
I have a full sack of résumés
that I drop off in stores,

720
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,179
places that I can work.

721
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,723
For now, I'll take anything.

722
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:37,394
Wow. Keep on.
Don't disappoint everybody.

723
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,581
Judaism has wanted a lot from me.

724
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,337
Being raised the way I am,
restricted from a lot of things,

725
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,839
kind of screwed up my whole future life,

726
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,633
because I was raised that way.

727
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,720
And I had to learn all of that on my own
after I was 18 years old.

728
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,972
I was kind of robbed of my life.

729
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:19,603
The majority who live this life, uh,
um, are quite content.

730
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,524
The implication of what you're saying

731
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:27,569
is that we need to stop
this entire enterprise,

732
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,738
this Hasidic whatever it is.

733
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,241
This is extreme, let's put an end to it.

734
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:34,451
-If someone knows--
-As I'm...

735
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,831
And I'm telling you, you're not the first,

736
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,708
and we are here to stay.

737
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,881
Judaism claims that God can do anything.

738
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:52,511
If God can do absolutely everything,
right, then there is no limit to God.

739
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:59,351
You hear stories about kids being raped.
Why is God not stopping that?

740
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,565
How is faith gonna help them?

741
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,278
There's no way you can explain that.

742
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,114
-Yeah, how could the Holocaust happen?
-Who--?

743
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:17,077
Either... there is a God,

744
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,123
and that thing is evil, very evil.

745
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:26,503
Or there is no God, and that's why
things are the way they are.

746
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,265
<i>Sometimes you are</i>
<i>at a loss for words.</i>

747
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,105
<i>Abuse is such a horrible thing.</i>

748
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:50,736
I have friends
who have revealed to me things that, um...

749
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,031
that is, uh, you know...

750
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:56,992
You can't sleep at night
after you listen to them.

751
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:05,250
There is a tremendous need
for more empathy for people like him.

752
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:12,549
And the way our community is handling
people like him, handling the issue,

753
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,677
there could be room
for a lot of improvement.

754
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,638
There's no... there's no doubt about it.

755
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,644
Is-- Is there somebody in this world
who could dismiss that?

756
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,981
Imagine living in such a pain constantly.
Constantly.

757
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,652
So I will pray to God.

758
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,864
He should-- Let's reach out to him.
Come back, my little boy.

759
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,993
He should feel an embrace of something.

760
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:46,041
It's called <i>aruch mi morem,</i>
a-- a spirit from upstairs.

761
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,210
I cry for him.

762
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,213
For his parents.

763
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:55,926
Because <i>yo-glyden, mish-glyden,</i>
he's in pain. He's in pain.

764
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:30,794
I got to court today.

765
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,090
My ex was there,

766
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:39,636
and there were like six or seven
family members with him, and...

767
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,904
Tomorrow, my kids are going away.

768
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,912
And what the judge did say was that,

769
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,541
they keep expressing their hate
towards their father

770
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,127
and they keep expressing
so much love towards their mother

771
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,629
that he's troubled by it.

772
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,174
So he's taking them away from me.

773
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,845
And what he also said
is that I may have no contact with them.

774
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,862
I don't even know how to tell my children

775
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,281
tomorrow morning that 1:00,
you're going away.

776
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,331
There's no basis for it.

777
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,460
The community has been displaying
the children's bad behavior

778
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,671
towards their father as my fault.

779
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,798
Um...

780
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,802
Yeah, and it's just...
My daughter is turning 11,

781
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,056
who I have a special
close relationship with.

782
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,144
He said after two weeks
I can write a letter.

783
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,479
That's what he gave me.

784
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,539
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

785
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,440
<i>The community</i>
<i>is really powerful,</i>

786
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:02,779
<i>and they have learned</i>
<i>what loopholes to use in the system</i>

787
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,114
<i>to get what they want.</i>

788
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:12,539
<i>It's really difficult</i>
<i>to raise your children</i>

789
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:16,042
<i>in a consistent lifestyle</i>
<i>of the way they have been raised,</i>

790
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,878
<i>and to keep status quo</i>

791
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:23,049
<i>when you're exploring an outside world.</i>

792
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:49,159
See the line at the bottom
and the line at the top.

793
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,701
There's a lot of letters here.

794
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:15,829
Mm-hmm.

795
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,460
Oh.

796
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:24,671
These are letters from my dad.

797
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:30,427
"To my dear son,
from the sweetness of my soul, Luzer.

798
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,764
How is the studying going?
God should help.

799
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,767
You should have good luck,
and keep excelling

800
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,061
and cause a lot of <i>nachas </i>for God."

801
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,733
I was doing really well those years.
They were really proud of me.

802
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,907
They had no idea
what a fucking nightmare I was gonna be.

803
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,246
I was not happy.
I was not happy at the time.

804
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,669
My sisters.

805
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:09,466
I think that was the first time
they reached out to me after I left.

806
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,429
And they couldn't really hang out with me,
but they wanted to say hi.

807
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:15,847
I thought it was very nice.

808
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,108
I'm pretty sure this is me
getting admitted

809
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,360
for trying to commit suicide.

810
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,002
My mom and my sister.

811
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,507
My kids.

812
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:54,761
I think he's my oldest one.

813
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:56,930
Yeah, they say he's good.

814
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,349
So they tell me.

815
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:23,957
Oh, motherfucker.

816
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:30,588
Oh, man.

817
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,548
<i>I know plenty of happy Hasidic people.</i>

818
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,763
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>I wish I could just go along with it</i>

819
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,639
<i>and not ask so many questions.</i>

820
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:29,647
<i>People want to have an ultimate truth.</i>

821
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:34,986
<i>We're all out here looking for purpose,</i>
<i>looking for meaning.</i>

822
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,114
<i>And they have that.</i>

823
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:42,118
<i>They have purpose</i>
<i>and they have meaning.</i>

824
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:48,917
<i>And I will always be trying to find it.</i>

825
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,736
<i>I thought it would be easy,</i>
<i>and it's not easy.</i>

826
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:07,787
<i>I don't think I'm actually ready</i>
<i>to live in a fully secular society.</i>

827
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:14,586
<i>I have this kind of secular anxiety.</i>

828
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:21,176
<i>I'm not blaming the community</i>
<i>or this rabbi,</i>

829
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,803
<i>this-- this guy who raped me, that guy.</i>

830
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,054
<i>I'm not blaming anyone.</i>

831
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:33,271
<i>But I have not found yet</i>
<i>what I really want to be a part of.</i>

832
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:39,916
Hey.

833
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,294
- <i>Mommy?</i>
- Yeah, baby?

834
01:29:43,377 --> 01:29:45,088
<i>Today was awesome.</i>

835
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:48,716
Today was awesome. Yes, it was.

836
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,967
Super awesome.

837
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:55,181
See? Together, we're double awesome,
that's right.

838
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,060
<i>-Mommy?</i>
-Yeah, baby?

839
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:00,686
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

840
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:05,066
<i>-Okay, you ready?</i>
<i>-</i>I am always ready for a quote.

841
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:09,862
<i>Okay. "I think it's--" No, this one.</i>

842
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:11,322
<i>"If we all do the things..."</i>

843
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,242
<i>"If we all did the things that we...</i>

844
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:18,037
<i>that we are capable of doing,</i>
<i>we will literally outstand ourselves."</i>

845
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,039
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

846
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:22,333
<i>Yeah.</i>

847
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,252
What are you doing
that's capable of doing?

848
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,298
<i>I am not breaking down and crying</i>
<i>every second of my life.</i>

849
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:30,424
Oh, wow.

850
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:32,635
Oh, wow, I didn't think you'd say that.

851
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:35,096
I thought you were gonna say
that you write very well.

852
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:38,182
But, wow, that's pretty powerful. Yeah.

853
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,143
And you're outstanding yourself
every single day,

854
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,727
and I'm super, super proud of you.

855
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,229
<i>Thanks, Ma.</i>

856
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,651
What do I always say? You gotta be--
Continue being your awesome you, okay?

857
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,319
<i>You always say that.</i>

858
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,406
I will always say it.
I will never get tired of saying it

859
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:55,908
'cause I want you to continue
being the awesome you.

860
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,078
-Keep it up.
<i>-Thanks.</i>

861
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:02,206
-And you'll outstand yourself, okay?
<i>-Okay.</i>

862
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,292
-Okay, cutie.
<i>-Bye.</i>

863
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,460
Okay. I love you so much, okay?

864
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,671
<i>-I love you too, Mommy. Bye.</i>
<i>-</i>Bye.

865
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:10,339
<i>Bye.</i>

866
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,674
Mwah.
