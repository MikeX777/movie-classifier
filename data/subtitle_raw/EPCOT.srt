1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,973
<i>Welcome to Disneyland, U.S.A.</i>

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,643
<i>This was all a Disney dream</i>
<i>a dozen years ago.</i>

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,773
<i>A far off project</i>
<i>that was totally unproved.</i>

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,044
<i>Today, 60 million people</i>

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,643
<i>have come here</i>
<i>from every state in America.</i>

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,122
<i>And from almost every nation</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

7
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:26,386
<i>In Town Square on Main Street,</i>

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,156
<i>many have paused to read</i>
<i>the dedication plaque</i>

9
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,130
<i>that symbolizes</i>
<i>the warm and friendly spirit</i>

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,167
<i>of Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom.</i>

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,533
<i>"To all who come to</i>
<i>this happy place, welcome.</i>

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,505
<i>"Disneyland is your land.</i>

13
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:44,101
<i>"Here, age relives</i>
<i>fond memories of the past.</i>

14
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,375
<i>"And here youth may savor</i>
<i>the challenge and promise</i>

15
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,506
<i>"of the future.</i>

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,644
<i>"Disneyland is dedicated</i>
<i>to the ideals, the dreams</i>

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,349
<i>"and the hard facts</i>
<i>that have created America.</i>

18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,326
<i>"With the hope that it will be</i>
<i>a source ofjoy and inspiration</i>

19
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,124
<i>"to all the world."</i>

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,991
<i>Disneyland grew out of</i>
<i>Walt Disney's own feeling</i>

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,160
<i>that an amusement park</i>
<i>should offer more</i>

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,033
<i>to the entire family.</i>

23
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,539
<i>Here was no mere amusement park.</i>

24
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,372
<i>Here was a whole new concept</i>
<i>in entertainment,</i>

25
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:21,778
<i>where parents and children</i>
<i>could have fun, together.</i>

26
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,379
<i>The touchstone of Disneyland's success</i>

27
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,388
<i>has been its concern for people.</i>

28
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,820
<i>A wholehearted dedication</i>

29
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,521
<i>to the happiness of the people</i>
<i>who visit here.</i>

30
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,496
<i>Today, Disneyland has established</i>

31
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,295
<i>standards of performance unsurpassed</i>
<i>in all the world.</i>

32
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,301
<i>Yet in the planning and building,</i>

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,805
<i>there were no standards to follow.</i>

34
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,774
<i>Whatever worked became the code.</i>

35
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,334
<i>Whatever failed</i>
<i>to meet the public need</i>

36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,075
<i>was changed, replaced</i>
<i>by a better idea.</i>

37
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,276
<i>People and vehicles are constantly</i>
<i>in motion at Disneyland.</i>

38
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,846
<i>Here, people travel aboard</i>
<i>almost every method</i>

39
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,484
<i>of transportation</i>
<i>man has ever designed.</i>

40
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,061
<i>Provocative, new ideas</i>

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,155
<i>like the first monorail system</i>
<i>in the Western hemisphere,</i>

42
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,100
<i>have demonstrated their potential</i>
<i>in this practical proving ground.</i>

43
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,565
<i>Disneyland vehicles have carried</i>
<i>340 million passengers</i>

44
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,700
<i>in comfort and speed,</i>

45
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,244
<i>and have traveled</i>
<i>more than 19 million miles</i>

46
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,109
<i>in unequaled safety.</i>

47
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,378
<i>To plan Disneyland, Walt Disney</i>

48
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,850
<i>long ago established</i>
<i>a design organization</i>

49
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,888
<i>called WED Enterprises.</i>

50
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,221
<i>Today, the staff at WED</i>
<i>includes designers, architects</i>

51
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,524
<i>and engineers skilled in the Disney way,</i>

52
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,791
<i>and also fine craftsmen and technicians</i>

53
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,232
<i>skilled in the arts of the space age.</i>

54
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,832
<i>What WED does</i>
<i>is called imagineering.</i>

55
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,144
<i>A blending of creative imagination</i>
<i>with technical know-how.</i>

56
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,742
<i>The talents of WED have gone</i>
<i>to work outside Disneyland too.</i>

57
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,242
<i>At the New York World's Fair,</i>

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,379
<i>four of the most popular attractions</i>

59
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,923
<i>were Disney shows</i>
<i>and corporate exhibits</i>

60
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,459
<i>that skillfully</i>
<i>welcomed and entertained</i>

61
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,588
<i>more than 150,000 people every day.</i>

62
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,274
<i>Tribute to the achievements</i>
<i>of the Disney design staff</i>

63
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,310
<i>has been paid by</i>
<i>many highly respected</i>

64
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,313
<i>planners and builders.</i>
<i>Among them, James W. Rouse,</i>

65
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,872
<i>developer of the new town of Columbia.</i>

66
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,747
<i>In his keynote speech</i>

67
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,219
<i>before the 1963</i>
<i>Urban Design Conference</i>

68
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,918
<i>of Harvard University,</i>
<i>Mr. Rouse said in part,</i>

69
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,085
<i>"I hold a view that</i>
<i>may be somewhat shocking</i>

70
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,789
<i>"to an audience</i>
<i>as sophisticated as this:</i>

71
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,957
<i>"That the greatest piece</i>
<i>of urban design</i>

72
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,831
<i>"in the United States today</i>
<i>is Disneyland.</i>

73
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,996
<i>"If you think about Disneyland</i>
<i>and think of its performance</i>

74
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,337
<i>"in relation to its purpose,</i>
<i>its meaning to people,</i>

75
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,173
<i>"more than that, its meaning</i>
<i>to the process of development,</i>

76
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,408
<i>"you will find it the outstanding</i>
<i>piece of urban design</i>

77
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,746
<i>"in the United States.</i>

78
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,615
<i>"It took an area of activity,</i>
<i>the amusement park,</i>

79
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,986
<i>"and lifted it to a standard</i>
<i>so high in its performance,</i>

80
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,652
<i>"in its respect for people,</i>
<i>in its functioning for people,</i>

81
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:25,187
<i>"that it really has become</i>
<i>a brand new thing.</i>

82
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,393
<i>"It fulfills all the functions</i>
<i>it set out to accomplish.</i>

83
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,164
<i>"Unselfconsciously, usefully,</i>

84
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,833
<i>"and profitably to</i>
<i>its owners and developers.</i>

85
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,705
<i>"I find more to learn</i>
<i>in the standards</i>

86
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,007
<i>"that have been set</i>
<i>and in the goals</i>

87
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,276
<i>"that have been achieved in</i>
<i>the development of Disneyland,</i>

88
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,512
<i>"than in any other single piece</i>
<i>of physical development</i>

89
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,076
<i>"in the country."</i>

90
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,927
<i>Yesterday, Disneyland and</i>
<i>the New York World's Fair.</i>

91
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,993
<i>Tomorrow, a project so vast</i>

92
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,900
<i>it has already been called</i>
<i>a whole new Disney World.</i>

93
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,905
<i>And now, here is Walt Disney.</i>

94
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,239
Welcome to a little bit
of Florida here in California.

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,370
This is where the early planning

96
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,745
is taking place for our so-called

97
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,114
Disney World project.

98
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,348
Now the purpose of this film
is to bring you up to date

99
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,117
about some of the plans
for Disney World.

100
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,024
But before I go into
any of the details,

101
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,027
I want to say just a word

102
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,996
about the site of our Florida project.

103
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,760
As you can see on this map,

104
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,268
we have a perfect location
in Florida.

105
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,531
Almost in the very center
of the state.

106
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,573
In fact, we selected this site

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,302
because it's so easy for
tourists and Florida residents

108
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,606
to get here by automobile.

109
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,443
Now in larger scale on this map,

110
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,608
our Florida land is located

111
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,211
partly in Orange County
and Osceola County,

112
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,348
between the cities
of Orlando and Kissimmee.

113
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:02,361
And the important thing is
that the Disney World is located

114
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,920
just a few miles
from the crossing point

115
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,025
of Interstate 4
and Sunshine State Parkway.

116
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,967
Florida's major highways

117
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,028
carrying motorists east and west,

118
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,769
north and south,
to the center of the state.

119
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,970
The sketches and plans
you will see today

120
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,172
are simply a starting point.

121
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,615
Our first overall thinking
about Disney World.

122
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,551
Everything in this room
may change time and time again,

123
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,486
as we move ahead.

124
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:34,152
But the basic philosophy of what
we're planning for Disney World

125
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,993
is going to remain very much
as it is right now.

126
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,360
We know what our goals are.

127
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,031
We know what we hope
to accomplish.

128
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,699
And believe me,

129
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,107
it's the most exciting
and challenging assignment

130
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,442
we've ever tackled
at Walt Disney Productions.

131
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,448
Today, I want to share with you

132
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,349
some of our ideas for Disney World.

133
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,786
Now the prologue to this film
told you some of the philosophy

134
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,656
that made Disneyland
in California what it is today.

135
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,354
Of course, there'll be
another amusement theme park

136
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,626
in Florida, similar to the one in California.

137
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,997
We're now developing a master plan

138
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,094
that encompasses the theme park
and all the facilities around it

139
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,105
that will serve the tourists.

140
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,769
Hotels, motels and a variety
of recreation activities.

141
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,244
In fact, just this little area alone

142
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,715
is five times the size
of Disneyland in California.

143
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,784
But as you can see
on this master plan,

144
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,419
the theme park and all
the other tourist facilities

145
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,659
fill just one small area
of our enormous Florida project.

146
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:51,568
According to this scale,
I am six miles tall.

147
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:56,132
Now it's 12 miles
from here, up to here,

148
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:01,738
and the whole area
encompasses 27,400 acres.

149
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,750
That is 43 square miles.

150
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,379
Twice the size
of the island of Manhattan.

151
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,719
Now the area
we propose to develop

152
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,315
is between the Reedy Creek swamp

153
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,328
and the Bonnet Creek Swamp.

154
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,330
So one thing we don't need

155
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,923
is a fence to protect us
from trespassers.

156
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,094
Here in Florida
we have something special

157
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,103
we never enjoyed at Disneyland:

158
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,105
The blessing of size.

159
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,540
There's enough land here
to hold all the ideas and plans

160
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,544
we could possibly imagine.

161
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,309
Right now, our plans include
an airport of the future,

162
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,113
down here in Osceola County.

163
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,779
An entrance complex where all visitors

164
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,221
will enter Disney World.

165
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,284
An industrial park area
covering about 1,000 acres,

166
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,626
and of course, the theme park area

167
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,859
way up here.

168
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,424
And all these varied activities

169
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,267
around the Disney World
will be tied together

170
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,967
by a high speed rapid transit system

171
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:06,445
running almost the full length
of the property.

172
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:10,415
But the most exciting,
and by far the most important

173
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,747
part of our Florida project,

174
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,380
in fact, the heart of everything
we'll be doing in Disney World,

175
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:20,483
will be our experimental
prototype city of tomorrow.

176
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,191
We call it EPCOT.

177
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,893
Spelled E-P-C-O-T.

178
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,495
Experimental Prototype
Community of Tomorrow.

179
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,938
Here it is, in larger scale.

180
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,580
EPCOT will take its cue

181
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,447
from the new ideas
and new technologies

182
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,112
that are now emerging
from the creative centers

183
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,088
of American industry.

184
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,454
It will be a community of tomorrow

185
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,052
that will never be completed,
but will always be introducing

186
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,862
and testing and demonstrating
new materials and new systems.

187
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,801
EPCOT will always be
a showcase to the world

188
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,566
for the ingenuity and imagination

189
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,573
of American free enterprise.

190
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,575
I don't believe there's a challenge

191
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,736
anywhere in the world
that's more important

192
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,246
to people everywhere,
than finding solutions

193
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,840
to the problems of our cities.

194
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,215
But where do we begin?

195
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,586
How do we start answering
this great challenge?

196
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:29,458
We're convinced we must start
with the public need.

197
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,898
And the need is not just
for curing the old ills of old cities.

198
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,902
We think the need is
for starting from scratch

199
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,737
on virgin land and building
a special kind of new community.

200
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,742
So that's what EPCOT is.

201
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,608
An experimental prototype community

202
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,671
that will always be
in a state of becoming.

203
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,617
It will never cease to be
a living blueprint of the future.

204
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,483
Where people actually live a life

205
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,251
they can't find anywhere else in the world.

206
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,952
Everything at EPCOT will be dedicated

207
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,589
to the happiness of the people
who live, work and play here,

208
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,792
and those who come here
from all around the world

209
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,358
to visit our living showcase.

210
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,666
We don't presume
to know all the answers.

211
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,299
In fact, we're counting
on the cooperation

212
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,401
of American industry to provide
their very best thinking

213
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,571
during the planning and the creation

214
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,105
of our experimental prototype
community of tomorrow.

215
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,482
And most important of all,

216
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,044
when EPCOT has become a reality,

217
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,147
and we find the need
for technologies

218
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,351
that don't even exist today,

219
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,226
it's our hope that EPCOT
will stimulate American industry

220
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,290
to develop new solutions that
will meet the needs of people

221
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,666
expressed right here
in this experimental community.

222
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,506
Well, that's our basic
philosophy for EPCOT.

223
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,503
By now, I'm sure you're wondering

224
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,671
how people will actually
live and work and move around

225
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,737
in our community of tomorrow.

226
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,340
So in the next few minutes,
we'll go into detail

227
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,615
about some of our preliminary
sketches and layouts.

228
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,883
"Remember those," I said earlier.

229
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,891
"This is just the beginning."

230
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,019
With that thought in mind,
let's have a look.

231
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,421
<i> No city of today</i>
<i>will serve as the guide</i>

232
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,161
<i>for the city of tomorrow.</i>

233
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,534
<i>EPCOT will be</i>
<i>a planned environment,</i>

234
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,268
<i>demonstrating to the world</i>
<i>what American communities</i>

235
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,005
<i>can accomplish through proper</i>
<i>control of planning and design.</i>

236
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,673
<i>EPCOT begins with an idea</i>
<i>new among cities</i>

237
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,377
<i>built since the birth of the automobile.</i>

238
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,583
<i>We call it "the radial plan."</i>

239
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,780
<i>Picture a wheel.</i>

240
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,552
<i>Like the spokes of the wheel,</i>

241
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>the city fans out</i>
<i>along a series of radials</i>

242
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,790
<i>from a bustling hub</i>
<i>at the center of EPCOT.</i>

243
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,231
<i>A network</i>
<i>of transportation systems</i>

244
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,667
<i>radiate from this central hub,</i>

245
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,763
<i>carrying people to and from</i>
<i>the heart of the city.</i>

246
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,370
<i>These transportation systems</i>
<i>circulate to and through</i>

247
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,438
<i>four primary spheres of activity</i>
<i>surrounding the central core.</i>

248
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,077
<i>First, the area</i>
<i>of business and commerce.</i>

249
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:12,016
<i>Next, the high density</i>
<i>apartment housing.</i>

250
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,925
<i>Then, the broad green belt</i>
<i>and recreation lands.</i>

251
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,587
<i>And finally,</i>

252
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,725
<i>the low density neighborhood</i>
<i>residential streets.</i>

253
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>EPCOT's dynamic urban center</i>

254
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,534
<i>will offer the excitement</i>
<i>and variety of activities</i>

255
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,701
<i>found only in metropolitan cities.</i>

256
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,440
<i>Cultural, social, business</i>
<i>and entertainment.</i>

257
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,109
<i>Among its major features will be:</i>

258
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,312
<i>A cosmopolitan hotel</i>
<i>and convention center,</i>

259
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,719
<i>towering 30 or more stories.</i>

260
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,018
<i>Shopping areas, where stores</i>
<i>and whole streets</i>

261
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:52,656
<i>recreate the character</i>
<i>and adventure of places round the world.</i>

262
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,393
<i>Theaters for dramatic</i>
<i>and musical productions.</i>

263
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,802
<i>Restaurants and a variety</i>
<i>of nightlife attractions.</i>

264
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,367
<i>And a wide range</i>
<i>of office buildings.</i>

265
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,901
<i>Some containing services</i>
<i>required by EPCOT's residents,</i>

266
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,312
<i>but most of them designed especially</i>

267
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:13,409
<i>to suit the local and regional</i>
<i>needs of major corporations.</i>

268
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,813
<i>But most important,</i>

269
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,416
<i>this entire 50 acres</i>
<i>of city streets and buildings</i>

270
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,223
<i>will be completely enclosed.</i>

271
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,431
<i>In this climate-controlled environment,</i>

272
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,991
<i>shoppers and theatergoers and</i>
<i>people just out for a stroll</i>

273
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,163
<i>will enjoy ideal weather conditions.</i>

274
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,104
<i>Protected day and night</i>

275
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,235
<i>from rain, heat and cold and humidity.</i>

276
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,782
<i>Here, the pedestrian will be king.</i>

277
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,845
<i>Free to walk and browse</i>
<i>without fear of motorized vehicles.</i>

278
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,152
<i>Only electric powered vehicles</i>
<i>will travel above the streets</i>

279
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,523
<i>of EPCOT's central city.</i>

280
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,857
<i>This towering hotel</i>
<i>is the visual center of EPCOT.</i>

281
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,834
<i>The shining jewel</i>
<i>at the center of the city.</i>

282
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,602
<i>It will offer tourists</i>
<i>and vacationers not only</i>

283
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,539
<i>the most modern guest rooms</i>
<i>and convention facilities,</i>

284
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,612
<i>but also a seven-acre recreation deck,</i>

285
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,672
<i>located high above the pedestrian</i>
<i>and shopping areas of the city.</i>

286
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,216
<i>But hidden from view,</i>
<i>directly beneath the hotel</i>

287
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,553
<i>is another kind of vital center.</i>

288
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,219
<i>EPCOT'S transportation lobby.</i>

289
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,355
<i>Although out of sight to hotel guests,</i>

290
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,298
<i>this transportation terminal</i>
<i>will play a key role</i>

291
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,665
<i>in the city of tomorrow's</i>
<i>ability to meet the needs</i>

292
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,897
<i>of both visitor and resident.</i>

293
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,906
<i>Two separate but interconnecting</i>
<i>transit systems will move people</i>

294
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,844
<i>into and out of EPCOT</i>
<i>in speed, safety and comfort</i>

295
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,542
<i>through this central terminal.</i>

296
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,982
<i>Both are electrically powered.</i>

297
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,455
<i>The high speed monorail for rapid transit</i>
<i>over longer distances,</i>

298
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,548
<i>and a concept new to the American city</i>

299
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,494
<i>for shorter travel distances,</i>
<i>the WEDWAY People Mover.</i>

300
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,190
<i>Automobiles and trucks</i>
<i>will not be barred from EPCOT.</i>

301
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,827
<i>In fact, a vast armada of vehicles</i>

302
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,701
<i>will continuously flow through</i>
<i>the heart of the community</i>

303
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,241
<i>traveling below the pedestrian level</i>

304
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,836
<i>on roadways reserved</i>
<i>for specific types of vehicles.</i>

305
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,515
<i>Let's look at another view</i>
<i>of EPCOT's transportation hub,</i>

306
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,109
<i>and see how traffic flows</i>
<i>through the heart of the city</i>

307
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,677
<i>on three separate levels.</i>

308
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,950
<i>At the bottom of the stack</i>
<i>is the truck route,</i>

309
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:36,188
<i>reserved for supply vehicles.</i>
<i>Trucks will have easy access</i>

310
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,423
<i>to all loading docks</i>
<i>and service elevators</i>

311
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,728
<i>for the delivery of commercial goods.</i>

312
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,397
<i>The middle level</i>
<i>is the automobile thruway,</i>

313
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,664
<i>exclusively for cars.</i>

314
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,138
<i>Adjacent to the roadway</i>
<i>are parking areas</i>

315
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,869
<i>for the convenience of hotel guests.</i>

316
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,343
<i>For the motorist just driving through,</i>

317
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,779
<i>no stoplight will ever slow</i>
<i>the constant flow of traffic</i>

318
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,010
<i>through the center of EPCOT.</i>

319
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,378
<i>But automobiles and freeways</i>
<i>will not be EPCOT's major way</i>

320
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,448
<i>of entering and leaving the city.</i>

321
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,792
<i>The transportation heartbeat of EPCOT</i>

322
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,656
<i>will be the two electric powered systems:</i>

323
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,326
<i>Monorail and WEDWAY,</i>

324
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,633
<i>that radiate to and from</i>
<i>the transportation lobby.</i>

325
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,537
<i>And the key system</i>
<i>in this coordinated network</i>

326
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,076
<i>will be the WEDWAY People Mover.</i>

327
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:31,049
<i>The first People Mover installation is</i>
<i>already in daily operation at Disneyland.</i>

328
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,953
<i>On peak days, it carries</i>
<i>nearly 40,000 passengers.</i>

329
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,826
<i>The cars you see here are approximately</i>
<i>5/8ths scale, considerably smaller</i>

330
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,692
<i>than full size passenger cars</i>
<i>would be for city use.</i>

331
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,994
<i>EPCOT's People Mover is a silent,</i>

332
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,503
<i>all electric system</i>
<i>that never stops running.</i>

333
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,285
<i>These cars continue to move</i>
<i>even while passengers</i>

334
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:11,084
<i>are disembarking or stepping aboard.</i>

335
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,495
<i>Power is supplied from a series</i>
<i>of motors embedded in the track,</i>

336
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,435
<i>completely independent of the cars.</i>

337
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,631
<i>No single car can ever break down,</i>

338
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:31,040
<i>and cause a rush hour</i>
<i>traffic jam in EPCOT.</i>

339
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,045
<i>Because the cars run continuously,</i>

340
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,571
<i>there will be no waiting in stations</i>
<i>for a WEDWAY People Mover.</i>

341
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,551
<i>The next car is always ready.</i>

342
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,458
<i>Now let's go back to</i>
<i>the transportation lobby,</i>

343
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,052
<i>and see how the WEDWAY</i>
<i>will travel along one radial</i>

344
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,030
<i>between the center of EPCOT,</i>

345
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,533
<i>and a typical residential area.</i>

346
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,626
<i>Leaving the transportation lobby,</i>

347
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,195
<i>the WEDWAY trains travel</i>
<i>above the downtown streets.</i>

348
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,003
<i>Within minutes,</i>

349
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,013
<i>the WEDWAYpasses through</i>
<i>the first station.</i>

350
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:10,948
<i>Many people who work</i>

351
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,679
<i>in the offices and stores</i>
<i>of EPCOT city center</i>

352
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,745
<i>board the WEDWAY here</i>
<i>for their trip home.</i>

353
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,256
<i>Some people leave</i>
<i>the WEDWAY here, too.</i>

354
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,793
<i>They live in EPCOT's</i>
<i>high density apartments,</i>

355
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,796
<i>surrounding the metropolitan center.</i>

356
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,462
<i>Most passengers who ride the WEDWAY</i>

357
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,434
<i>live beyond the apartments and</i>
<i>stay aboard the People Mover</i>

358
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,496
<i>as it crosses EPCOT's</i>
<i>sheltering green belt.</i>

359
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,170
<i>EPCOT's green belt is more</i>
<i>than just a broad expanse</i>

360
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,407
<i>of beautiful lawns</i>
<i>and walks and trees.</i>

361
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,677
<i>Here too are the community's</i>
<i>varied recreational facilities.</i>

362
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,877
<i>Its playgrounds for children,</i>

363
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,319
<i>its churches and its schools.</i>

364
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,914
<i>Beyond the green belt are</i>
<i>EPCOT's neighborhood areas</i>

365
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,926
<i>of single family homes.</i>

366
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,726
<i>This is one radial neighborhood.</i>

367
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:02,792
<i>Here, and throughout the community,</i>
<i>residents returning from work or shopping</i>

368
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,861
<i>will disembark from the WEDWAY</i>
<i>at stations located just a few steps</i>

369
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,703
<i>from where they live.</i>

370
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,107
<i>The homes are located</i>
<i>in a wide green area</i>

371
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,341
<i>that provides light recreation</i>
<i>activities for adults,</i>

372
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,747
<i>and play areas for children.</i>

373
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,810
<i>Circulating through this area</i>

374
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,081
<i>are footpaths reserved for pedestrians,</i>

375
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,680
<i>electric carts and bicycles.</i>

376
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,750
<i>Children going to and from</i>
<i>schools and playgrounds</i>

377
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,762
<i>will use these paths.</i>

378
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,162
<i>Always completely safe and separated</i>
<i>from the automobile.</i>

379
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,093
<i>The resident leaving home</i>
<i>in his automobile</i>

380
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,800
<i>will drive down a street</i>
<i>reserved for motor vehicles.</i>

381
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,141
<i>He then enters a one-way road</i>
<i>that circles the city center.</i>

382
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,875
<i>This road carries the motorist</i>
<i>onto the main thruway,</i>

383
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,975
<i>connecting EPCOT with</i>
<i>other points in Disney World</i>

384
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:57,352
<i>and with Florida's nearby</i>
<i>network of major highways.</i>

385
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,386
<i>But most EPCOT residents</i>
<i>will drive their automobiles</i>

386
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,087
<i>only on weekend pleasure trips.</i>

387
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,689
<i>From all over the community,</i>
<i>residents going to theirjobs</i>

388
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,860
<i>converge by WEDWAY on the center city.</i>

389
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,837
<i>Many work downtown in offices,</i>
<i>stores and shops.</i>

390
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,973
<i>But most employees go beyond</i>
<i>the city core to theirjobs.</i>

391
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:23,276
<i>From the transportation lobby,</i>
<i>monorail trains carry employees</i>

392
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,249
<i>either to the theme park,</i>

393
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,084
<i>or to EPCOT's 1,000-acre industrial park.</i>

394
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,552
<i>At this central station</i>
<i>in the industrial complex</i>

395
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,788
<i>passengers disembark from the monorail</i>

396
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:42,061
<i>and again board WEDWAY cars</i>
<i>that radiate to each facility.</i>

397
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,864
<i>This industrial complex</i>
<i>will provide employment</i>

398
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,531
<i>for many people who live in EPCOT.</i>

399
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,905
<i>But it will mean much more,</i>
<i>not only for this community</i>

400
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,501
<i>but also for American industry.</i>

401
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:58,441
<i>Here, the Disney staff will</i>
<i>work with individual companies</i>

402
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,453
<i>to create a showcase of industry at work.</i>

403
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,424
<i>In attractive park-like settings,</i>

404
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,985
<i>the six million people</i>
<i>who visit Disney World each year</i>

405
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,658
<i>will look behind the scenes</i>
<i>at experimental prototype plants,</i>

406
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,997
<i>research and development laboratories,</i>

407
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,596
<i>and computer centers</i>
<i>for major corporations.</i>

408
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,269
<i>So this is EPCOT,</i>

409
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>the heart of Disney World.</i>

410
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,941
<i>In other parts of the country,</i>

411
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,947
<i>a community the size of this prototype</i>

412
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,540
<i>could become part</i>
<i>of an entire city complex,</i>

413
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,882
<i>composed of many such communities,</i>

414
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,515
<i>planned and built a few miles apart.</i>

415
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>In Disney World, about 20,000 people</i>

416
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,922
<i>will actually live in EPCOT.</i>

417
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,623
<i>Their homes will be built in ways</i>

418
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,598
<i>that permit ease of change,</i>

419
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,261
<i>so that new products may</i>
<i>continuously be demonstrated.</i>

420
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,931
<i>Their schools will welcome new ideas,</i>

421
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,497
<i>so that everyone who grows up in EPCOT</i>

422
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,806
<i>will have skills in pace</i>
<i>with today's world.</i>

423
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,972
<i>EPCOT will be a working community,</i>

424
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,313
<i>with employment for all.</i>
<i>And everyone who lives here</i>

425
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,548
<i>will have a responsibility</i>
<i>to help keep this community</i>

426
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:13,149
<i>an exciting, living blueprint of the future.</i>

427
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,592
<i>And now, here again,</i>
<i>is Walt Disney.</i>

428
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,463
That's the starting point
for our experimental prototype

429
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,524
community of tomorrow.

430
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,401
Now, where do we go from these
preliminary plans and sketches?

431
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,908
Well, a project like this
is so vast in scope

432
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,502
that no one company alone
can make it a reality.

433
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,639
But if we can bring together
the technical know-how

434
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,809
of American industry
and the creative imagination

435
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,853
of the Disney organization,

436
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm confident we can create
right here in Disney World

437
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,615
a showcase to the world

438
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,491
of the American free enterprise system.

439
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,724
I believe we can build a community

440
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,732
that more people will talk about

441
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,430
and come to look at
than any other area in the world.

442
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,735
And with your cooperation,

443
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:06,073
I'm sure this experimental
prototype community of tomorrow

444
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:09,137
can influence the future of city living

445
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:13,617
for generations to come.
It's an exciting challenge.

446
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,745
A once in a lifetime opportunity

447
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,585
for everyone who participates.

448
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,115
Speaking for myself and
the entire Disney organization,

449
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,826
we're ready to go right now.
