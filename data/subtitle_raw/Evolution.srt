1
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:10,682
Doctor!

2
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:13,802
Doctor!

3
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:15,722
Let's go. This way.

4
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,762
Stop.

5
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:26,642
Doctor!

6
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,443
Let me see.

7
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,002
She's alright.

8
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,402
She'll be healthy.

9
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,322
Come on, bring the motorcycle.
Come on, come on.

10
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,162
Mama?

11
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:01,922
Did you forget I was coming?
Why are you still in your nightgown?

12
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,642
We have to go.

13
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,843
It's 11 AM.

14
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,842
The ceremony is
in 30 minutes.

15
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:13,402
I didn't sleep all night.
I heard you screaming.

16
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:14,522
What?

17
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,882
You screamed,
then you both just left.

18
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,242
When?

19
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:23,122
When many of you were here,
along with the child.

20
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:26,923
I was making coffee.
Jonas wasn't here.

21
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,323
You just said
I was here with Jonas.

22
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:31,402
Well...

23
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,562
Is everything OK?
You're not telling me...

24
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:38,122
Mama, what year is it
and where do I live?

25
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:40,082
In Berlin, right?

26
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,202
You left after your husband...

27
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:45,082
I escaped from him.
My ex-husband.

28
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,522
So how could I have been here
with my child?

29
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:51,842
Well, you're here now.

30
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,682
You used to be here.

31
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,563
Listen.

32
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:59,683
I wake up at least
ten times a night,

33
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:04,322
so when I woke up the eleventh time,
it was strange...

34
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:06,242
I have a headache.

35
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:09,122
I saw something so strange,

36
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:15,482
I felt like I was really there.
It was all so real.

37
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,883
What was it?
Reality or a dream?

38
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:24,842
Well, I'm confused
as to whether I was here or there.

39
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:30,643
Here, where? I'm here now,
but I wasn't here yesterday.

40
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,883
No, I just came from the airport.

41
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,002
It's 11 AM.

42
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:41,002
I'm in the living room
and you scared me to death.

43
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:46,363
Listen, Léna, don't be angry with me.
I love you so very much. Come here.

44
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:54,122
Mama, it was only a dream.

45
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:56,362
Only a dream.

46
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,522
It's diabetic.

47
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,922
You like this.

48
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:08,402
Yes, I like that. Thanks so much.

49
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:09,763
How's your stomach?

50
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,803
It's kind of alright.

51
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,803
Have you taken your meds?

52
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:18,842
Léna, for God's sake,
don't talk to me like that.

53
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:22,642
I'm not a child.
I take my meds and that's that.

54
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:24,962
Yes, they turned off the water.

55
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,803
- Again?
- Yes, again.

56
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,563
You have nightmares sometimes,
don't you?

57
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,082
I never dream.

58
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:41,722
That's not good.

59
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:43,642
Which shirt do you
want to wear?

60
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,722
The blue or the pink one?

61
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,323
The other one.

62
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:52,123
- The Jews wrote again.
- What did they write?

63
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,722
- They don't believe we're Jewish.
- Ha, all the better!

64
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,923
Where is Grandma's
birth certificate?

65
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,602
Which one?
She had like five.

66
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:01,322
- Five?
- Yes, five.

67
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,803
Here.

68
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:06,002
Help me take this out.

69
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:07,963
Careful.

70
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:11,002
It's in here, let's see.

71
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:14,722
Hold this.

72
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:21,202
Here she's a Christian
from Budapest.

73
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,922
As Sára Blanz.

74
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,163
Interesting.

75
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:29,482
Another Budapest-born Christian,
but with a different name.

76
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,082
So that's no good, either.

77
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,283
Here she's Jewish.

78
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:36,163
- With ISR?
- Yes, Israelite.

79
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:41,122
But Dad made a note that it's a fake.

80
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:42,643
It's forged?

81
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:46,762
Forgers will be forging...

82
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:49,402
- This is mine, it's not important.
- Can I see?

83
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,322
No, this can't be yours.

84
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:57,322
- It is!
- There were no streets there, Mama.

85
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,282
- "Kasernenstrasse."
- Of course, that's the SS joke.

86
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,723
They wrote "Kasernenstrasse"
for every newborn.

87
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:06,602
So this is real?

88
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,283
As real as it is fake.

89
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,562
That's the Bratislava-born Jew...

90
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:17,002
Right, then I'll take that one.

91
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:19,483
Wait.
You want to take it?

92
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,482
- Yeah, why?
- You can't, Léna.

93
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,203
I'll never get it back.

94
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,882
Mama, this is my 25th letter
to the German Council of Jews.

95
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:31,562
The documents from the synagogue,
birth certificates,

96
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:34,562
proof of support
from the Jewish Claims Conference...

97
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,763
All officially translated
into German,

98
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,683
it cost me a shitload of money.

99
00:24:38,803 --> 00:24:41,722
Passport,
photographs of your grave...

100
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:45,002
- Thanks a lot!
- Sorry, of your mother's grave.

101
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,403
- Blasphemy!
- Yes, I found Grandma's grave.

102
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:51,842
I stepped in dogshit, took the photo,
scanned and sent it...

103
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:55,322
- Fantastic!
- No, it wasn't fantastic.

104
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:59,923
- Why not?
- Her maiden name isn't on the grave.

105
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:04,562
So give me this document or my life
was about the Holocaust for nothing.

106
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:08,683
Your life wasn't about the Holocaust,
Léna, I made sure of that.

107
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:12,283
Mama, what four-year-old
had to shop on her own

108
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:18,202
or put dry crust in plastic bags
and hide them in drawers?

109
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:21,523
Had to wear long hair,
when short hair was in fashion?

110
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,683
Or when I had
an open fracture?

111
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:28,762
I couldn't cry or complain.
A fracture isn't pain, right?

112
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,962
My life was about the Holocaust
and I still can't prove I'm Jewish.

113
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,642
- Give me that.
- And why would you?

114
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,562
Prove it to whom?

115
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:41,722
To people who forced us
to spend our lives hiding the fact?

116
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:46,522
People who made us
have to deny it?

117
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:50,443
Those who want us to prove it
are idiots.

118
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:55,723
And they don't know history!
And you know what else?

119
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:58,402
- What?
- They're Germans.

120
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:00,682
I don't care what you think.

121
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:03,562
I want to get
my child out of the country,

122
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:06,842
- just like your mama got you out.
- I won't give it to you.

123
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:10,363
Only the Jews
can get Jonas into kindergarten.

124
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:13,042
You don't know what Berlin's like,
pure hell.

125
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:15,643
It's a six-month waiting list
or you pay.

126
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,082
- I need the document.
- I can't do that.

127
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,922
- Yes, you can.
- No...

128
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:24,322
Mama, it's my right.
Help me for once in my life.

129
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,642
- You're a bully!
- Unbelievable.

130
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:30,082
I'm only protecting you.

131
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,843
By keeping Jonas
out of kindergarten?

132
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,762
Where are you taking it?
To the synagogue?

133
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:35,923
- Yes!
- See?

134
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,162
That's precisely the problem.

135
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:42,362
They'll copy all the data
onto a list

136
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:45,562
and round them up
to be slaughtered.

137
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:48,482
- They won't be slaughtered!
- They will!

138
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:53,242
My mother once made
a very bad decision.

139
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:57,163
She let them
register her family in 1942

140
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,962
and was taken
by the Hlinka Guard.

141
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:03,602
Léna, don't be
where they make the list.

142
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,203
Unbelievable.

143
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:09,242
We'll discuss this later.

144
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:11,122
Let's go.

145
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:14,923
I'm not going anywhere,
nowhere at all!

146
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,283
Why?

147
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,802
I won't accept a ribbon
from the mustached.

148
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:20,642
- What mustached?
- None of them!

149
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,642
- Why?
- It's shameful.

150
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:24,802
Your shame?

151
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,723
No, I'd be ashamed
to accept it.

152
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,802
Then accept it
and feel ashamed!

153
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,962
I won't take advantage
of the tragedy.

154
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:37,003
Mama, for once in your life,
you should.

155
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,922
Léna, listen to me:

156
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:43,003
We're the lucky ones,
aren't we?

157
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:47,042
And we don't brag about the deaths
of the unfortunate ones, right?

158
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:48,883
Or accept money for it.

159
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:52,682
We could finally have some money.

160
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:54,562
Think about Jonas.

161
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:58,162
Think about me.
I just got divorced.

162
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:01,322
It wasn't just now, for God's sake.
When was it?

163
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:04,603
January or April,

164
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,162
I wrote it down,
let me find it.

165
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,283
You wrote that down?

166
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:13,162
- I write down everything.
- Fine, then I'll accept it.

167
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:15,883
- What?
- "What?" The prize!

168
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,283
I'll tell them you're sick!

169
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:21,362
We were Jewish
when we couldn't be,

170
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:24,802
and now that we can be,
we aren't Jewish.

171
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,202
Unbelievable!

172
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:30,602
We agreed to go to the ceremony.
That's why I flew home.

173
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,962
I've been thinking of that
all morning.

174
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,522
Why am I getting this award?
Why?

175
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:41,122
- For your life achievements.
- No, no!

176
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:43,762
No, they're using me
as a badge.

177
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:47,002
They'll glorify themselves
and smear me in the process.

178
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,602
What do you care?

179
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:49,763
Fine.

180
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,363
Let's face up to it, OK, Léna.

181
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,082
They were in on it.
Every single one of them.

182
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:57,322
Why do you care
after all these years?

183
00:28:57,442 --> 00:29:02,962
Why?
Just because. It's quite intriguing.

184
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:06,362
Listen.
Remain desperate and be miserable,

185
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:09,122
but I'm not sitting down
with those devils.

186
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:15,122
I'm still going to take the money.
I deserve it.

187
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:18,763
I'm tired of feeling ashamed.

188
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:24,883
You can stay here, but I'm gone.
I don't care what you think about me.

189
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:46,762
You win, Mama.

190
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,642
You win.
I'm not going anywhere.

191
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,842
So Grandma was never
on Orsó Street?

192
00:29:54,163 --> 00:29:57,283
You said you were
deported from there, right?

193
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,043
Not really.

194
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:04,882
Only my father made it
to Orsó Street.

195
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:11,203
Mama never forgave him
for "vacationing" in Budapest

196
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:15,082
while we were in a living hell.

197
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:17,563
That isn't what you told me.

198
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:21,763
You said Grandma was pregnant
and that's why they went there.

199
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,002
That she was pregnant?
I'm not sure.

200
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:29,482
I'm not sure
she knew by then.

201
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:32,282
But you know Mama's charisma
was legendary.

202
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,642
She had aquamarine blue eyes,

203
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:42,722
beautiful blond hair.
No one took her for a Jew.

204
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:47,563
In the camp during the separation,
they didn't realize she was pregnant.

205
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:53,282
She was taken there
on the last Slovak transport.

206
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:57,362
The old and ill
were gassed immediately.

207
00:30:57,763 --> 00:31:03,043
Mama was strong
and worked as if in the trenches,

208
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,002
physical work.

209
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:10,882
She was given scraps of bread
that she kept for the Kapos.

210
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:16,402
After collecting them every day
for a month, she used them

211
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:20,402
to bribe the Kapos
and become a seamstress.

212
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:24,082
Bread was her currency,
Léna.

213
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,483
You know?
That's why we hoarded bread crust.

214
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:32,042
Why did we have to remind ourselves
of the suffering?

215
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:34,522
Gnawing away like rats.

216
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:36,283
I found it revolting.

217
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:39,842
She found it revolting, too.

218
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,202
Like everything else in her life.

219
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:47,162
In the 50s,
when there was nothing to eat,

220
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:52,003
she couldn't eat. Her patients
brought her slices of boiled ham.

221
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:57,883
She said it was typhus from the camp
that ruined her stomach.

222
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:03,922
But then she would've died with me
in her belly, so that can't be true.

223
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,562
The miracle is that
I was born at all.

224
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:11,722
Everyone told her to abort
or she'd go to hell.

225
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:18,763
Or give birth
and drown me in a bucket

226
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:21,883
or strangle me
with her bare hands.

227
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:26,203
- Why are you telling me this?
- I'm sorry.

228
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:32,162
Do you think you should tell your
daughter this about her own mother?

229
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:35,563
No, no.

230
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:43,682
- It's the truth.
- It's your truth, Mama. Your truth.

231
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:47,482
It's all you talk about.
All our books are about this.

232
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,722
- It's your obsession.
- Sure.

233
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:55,963
Instead of playing in the park, I was
reading books about all these freaks.

234
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:01,282
Because I was one of those freaks,
Léna.

235
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:06,122
- I don't even know if you love me.
- How could you? You're my mother.

236
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:09,163
Do you feel that you love me, Léna?

237
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,082
Or am I just a freak to you?

238
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:19,603
All my childhood,
I was waiting for a proper hug.

239
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,162
For you to play with me.

240
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,483
You never let me get close.

241
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,202
I remember

242
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:32,602
reading alone in my room while
you were reading in the living room.

243
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:35,402
As if we were afraid
of each other.

244
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:41,443
You vaccinated me
with distrust of the world.

245
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:43,442
I don't...

246
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,002
remember being calm
or letting go.

247
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:50,443
I was your little angel,
not a real child.

248
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:56,083
My clothes were never dirty.
I never got bad grades,

249
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:59,762
but if I did,
you didn't get angry.

250
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:03,043
You congratulated me
with a cold handshake.

251
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,362
I was lying in wait,
just like you.

252
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:21,163
I remember you trying to fit in,
your unnatural voice on the phone.

253
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,522
An octave higher
than your usual one.

254
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,962
But I did once hear
your real voice.

255
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:36,002
When Dad took off with his luggage.

256
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,442
You were sitting on that...

257
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:43,282
Yes, on the red stool.

258
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,682
And you were crying...

259
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:50,722
Every single day after that, you said
we could survive on an iceberg

260
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:57,362
But what child wants to live
on a damned iceberg?

261
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:00,242
You call that a proper childhood?

262
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,282
I don't know what...

263
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:06,643
"A proper childhood,
a proper childhood..."

264
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,242
I don't even know
what that is.

265
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:11,882
I was born during a roll call.

266
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:16,723
My mother was gnawing at her fists
while the others covered her,

267
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,123
so the SS wouldn't see.

268
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:22,162
I was so tiny,
I just slipped out of her

269
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:24,602
and they took me
to the barracks.

270
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,722
I was too weak to cry,
thank God.

271
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,283
But an SS woman's dog
sniffed me out anyway.

272
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:35,042
They hauled me in my rags
to the roll call area.

273
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:39,562
All the Germans kept screaming,
"Whose baby is this?"

274
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:41,923
They held Mama back.

275
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:46,442
But she stood up and claimed me.
She was that brave.

276
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:51,643
A nice looking guy came,
he was quite a "celeb."

277
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,482
His name was Mengele.

278
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,922
He picked me up
out of the dust

279
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,682
and approached my mother.

280
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:08,323
He stared into
her beautiful blue eyes and said,

281
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:11,402
"You don't look Jewish at all."

282
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,922
He took the two of us
to the hospital.

283
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:19,802
My mother was hoping he would
spare us, but she was wrong.

284
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:22,882
He strapped her chest
so she couldn't breastfeed me.

285
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:28,562
He wanted to see
how long I could survive without it.

286
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:34,123
On the third day, I was gray.
Mengele came and told her,

287
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,523
"I'll come for you
in the morning."

288
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,002
Everyone knew
what that meant.

289
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:46,802
Mama didn't sleep that night,
she just kept looking at me.

290
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:50,042
With her beautiful blue eyes.

291
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:54,842
She knew she could get away
with strangling me.

292
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,522
But what kind of person
would she then be?

293
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:02,282
It was her third chance,
but she still didn't do it.

294
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,483
She was that tough.

295
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:07,322
Morning came,
but Mengele didn't appear.

296
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:11,402
A Krakow transport arrived
that he had to deal with.

297
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:15,562
That was July 26th. I was given
a number, stamped on my thigh.

298
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:19,642
Léna,
it was my second birthday.

299
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,322
I wasn't a real child,

300
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:29,563
I was more like
a little wild animal.

301
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:34,882
I entertained the SS
by pulling worms out of the soil

302
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:38,563
and eating them
while they laughed at me.

303
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:41,282
- You can't possibly remember that.
- No.

304
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:45,643
I learned it all from Mama.

305
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:48,643
All those conversations
with her friends.

306
00:37:48,763 --> 00:37:50,482
In this apartment?

307
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:55,202
I was always hiding and listening
under the table.

308
00:37:55,322 --> 00:38:01,843
All those stories about who didn't
come home and who was killed.

309
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,762
Their friends, their family...

310
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,482
"Died," "killed,"
"died" and "killed..."

311
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:10,402
I heard it all the time.

312
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,042
"Died," "killed,"
"died," "killed..."

313
00:38:13,522 --> 00:38:16,963
But I did learn to stay quiet.

314
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:23,362
I just kept quiet and took it all in.
You know, the wise are quiet.

315
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:27,523
And what do the stupid do, Léna?
What?

316
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,322
- I don't know.
- The stupid argue.

317
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:37,442
I'm starting to forget things.
What was I going to say?

318
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:41,122
You think it's OK
I never had a proper childhood

319
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,363
because you didn't have one.

320
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:48,482
No, no. I did have a childhood.
A lousy one.

321
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:51,682
- I used to play with Gizi Szabó.
- Gizi from the basement.

322
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:55,882
Gizi from the basement.
She was my classmate.

323
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:59,083
Her mother once said,

324
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,602
"No need to worry, children.

325
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:07,162
"That wicked old Jew is still around
who chops up Christian children,

326
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:11,162
"puts the pieces into his bag
and grinds them down."

327
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,322
I don't know
if he eats them, too.

328
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:16,922
But I, who was born in Auschwitz

329
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:20,282
and found by Polish medics,

330
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:25,603
knew I shouldn't listen to that.
Just keep quiet.

331
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,603
I went back under the table to cry.

332
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:31,123
- Those people always hated us.
- Yes, the caretaker...

333
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,963
Her husband called me
a filthy Jew on the street.

334
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:36,802
How did you react?

335
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:38,683
I just crossed the road.

336
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:44,203
The hatred was significant but there
was always envy mixed in with it:

337
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:47,443
Mama and I both survived the camp!
She came back for me!

338
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:51,322
She has nice clothes
and a medical practice again!

339
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:53,882
Where did she get
the Chinese vase from?

340
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:57,842
Why is she getting presents
from her patients?

341
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:03,403
"Childhood, childhood, childhood."

342
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:06,403
It should be liberating, right?

343
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,722
But that's not how
I remember it.

344
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,962
What depressed me most
was being asked,

345
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:14,083
"Where were you born, little girl?"

346
00:40:14,642 --> 00:40:19,042
Because I had to answer,
"Kasernenstrasse in Auschwitz."

347
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,682
I loathed it.

348
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:27,122
Mama came back for me,
but brought me to Budapest in vain.

349
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:30,682
We pretended we were liberated,
but I still knew that...

350
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:37,123
deep down,
it was still really all about that.

351
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:42,122
This was the beginning
and end of everything.

352
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:48,242
But there's always
someone who helps out, Léna.

353
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:53,282
And I had a funny man, too:
my father.

354
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:57,043
A funny guy.

355
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:00,523
He always joked...

356
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:05,522
about the women
looking for their husbands

357
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:10,802
who had died in labor camps.
They held hands with their new men.

358
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:16,522
He claimed Mama wasn't so lucky
because he survived.

359
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:21,242
Dad found that amusing.

360
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:27,842
All they wanted was a new life.
A life.

361
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:32,242
Dad couldn't joke for long,

362
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:36,562
because he was against
the Soviet Occupation.

363
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:39,602
They accused him
of Zionist conspiracy.

364
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:45,163
He took Jewish kids
up the Buda hills to sing.

365
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:48,842
What a great Zionist!
They put him in prison...

366
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:54,842
Mama told me he went to Israel
because he didn't want to live here.

367
00:41:55,442 --> 00:42:00,403
One of my teachers,
Miss Magdi, stopped me in the street

368
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:04,442
and told me my father was in prison,
not Israel.

369
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:09,403
Who could I have
talked to about that? Gizi? No.

370
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:15,242
Then we learned about the Soviet
Pioneers. Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya!

371
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:21,442
She was tortured, but never confessed
and I wanted to be the same.

372
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:24,682
I will be Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya!

373
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:29,203
Torture me, but I will confess
nothing, nothing at all!

374
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:33,283
I had a photograph of her
on the door of my locker.

375
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:37,922
Whenever I opened it, I said:
"Hello, Zoya. Hello, hello."

376
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:43,802
In 1953 when Stalin died...
I loved Stalin, by the way.

377
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:49,762
I wrote the most beautiful essay.

378
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,482
I can remember the first line:

379
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,443
"The whole world
is shrouded in a veil."

380
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:57,883
You still remember that?

381
00:42:58,003 --> 00:43:00,362
Of course, I'm a writer.

382
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:08,162
The next date was much
more important: July 14, 1956.

383
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:14,162
Communist leadership gave amnesty
to a lot of political prisoners,

384
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:16,123
including my father.

385
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:22,162
On July 14th, 1956, he was
standing here with two suitcases.

386
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:26,242
He didn't even say ciao.

387
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,602
He took off
and I never saw him again.

388
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:32,122
- That isn't true.
- Excuse me?

389
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:35,443
That isn't true.
You said you met him later.

390
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:37,682
You two ate Sacher cake.

391
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:42,482
That time in Vienna in the 60s?
Big deal.

392
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,362
He refused to order food in German.

393
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:48,202
Our whole family spoke German.

394
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:51,082
Back then,
Mama used to go to West Germany

395
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:55,162
to register the Socialist
pharmaceutical products.

396
00:43:57,283 --> 00:44:00,322
I already knew
from reading their correspondence

397
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:05,722
that my father and his new family
thought Europe was cursed.

398
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:13,562
I asked Mama about it
and she confirmed.

399
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:18,562
So there I told my father:
"Listen, Dad.

400
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:24,242
"It's easy to judge from Israel
how things should be here.

401
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:30,562
"But we have to make do on this land.
And we want to move on."

402
00:44:31,363 --> 00:44:33,482
He was offended.

403
00:44:33,763 --> 00:44:37,162
I then ordered the Sacher
in English,

404
00:44:37,682 --> 00:44:42,002
but the waiter
didn't speak English.

405
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:46,843
I was sitting there,
squeezing my father's hand,

406
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:49,202
and he was squeezing mine,

407
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:53,602
and I felt
so deeply ashamed of him.

408
00:44:54,043 --> 00:44:58,042
At the same time,
I missed him terribly.

409
00:44:58,522 --> 00:45:00,283
And I knew

410
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:03,802
he was going to leave me.

411
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,002
That was my father.

412
00:45:10,483 --> 00:45:13,642
But Mama knew how to help me.

413
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:17,362
She told me
nothing could ever happen to me.

414
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:21,163
That we could live on the iceberg
and keep warm.

415
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:26,402
That's what I want to pass on to you,
her toughness:

416
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:28,922
Nothing will ever happen to us.

417
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:32,803
How tough is it to give birth
to a baby in Auschwitz?

418
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,922
Tough, right?

419
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:43,603
I was tough once, too.
In the 70s, can you imagine

420
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:46,562
how tough I was with Gabi Szántó?

421
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:55,762
I was the head of the
Petőfi Museum of Literature.

422
00:45:56,482 --> 00:46:00,242
- They put us with Gábor Szántó.
- Did he flirt with you?

423
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:03,763
Ah, don't ask.
Now I'm scared.

424
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:05,323
You can tell me.

425
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:08,162
We never slept together.

426
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:13,922
Come on, Lena.
Let's drop the subject.

427
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:16,963
Anyway,
I was there as an interpreter.

428
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:23,122
Gábor took me to a meeting
for a German fishing magazine.

429
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:30,122
The Germans wanted to change
the image of the paper

430
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:32,443
and feature less...

431
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:37,363
What's the name
of that fish people eat?

432
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:38,683
Sardines?

433
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,122
No, another one.

434
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:44,203
- Maybe carp?
- Yes.

435
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:49,162
They couldn't feature carp anymore,
because it's a Jewish fish.

436
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:51,482
Jewish.

437
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:55,963
And there I am, decades later,

438
00:46:56,962 --> 00:46:59,642
wondering how a fish
could be Jewish.

439
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:04,483
The German said,
"Jews eat a lot of carp.

440
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,802
"That's why people hate it."

441
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:11,882
You're imagining this.
This is your paranoia.

442
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:15,242
You know the saying, "A man with
a hammer sees nails everywhere?"

443
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:17,362
I remember it clearly.

444
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:20,882
He said they had to eliminate
Jewish carp from the paper.

445
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:23,482
They're bad for sales.

446
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:28,802
And I thought,
"It's not my duty to speak out."

447
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:33,602
Perhaps other people
felt the same back then.

448
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:38,722
When they didn't stand up
for us "Jewish fish."

449
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:42,202
Because we belong to
a different species.

450
00:47:42,322 --> 00:47:44,842
I don't want to belong
to a different species.

451
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,642
- Then what do you want?
- What do I want?

452
00:47:47,762 --> 00:47:48,922
What?

453
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:52,963
To be young and beautiful.
To leave all this behind.

454
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:55,723
To go and live
in a warmer climate

455
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:58,843
and get fucked
by 20 suntanned young men.

456
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:03,322
- If that's what makes you happy.
- Yes, it would.

457
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,522
Or rather, I just don't know.

458
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:12,163
You talk as if everything
were still possible for me,

459
00:48:12,283 --> 00:48:14,203
but it isn't.
Nothing is possible.

460
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,882
It's unbearable to be like this

461
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:21,283
or to be in denial of it all.

462
00:48:22,123 --> 00:48:24,842
In the end,
be anything but this.

463
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,002
I don't want to be a survivor.
I want to be alive.

464
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:34,123
If God held everyone's hand
in the gas chamber,

465
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,683
why won't He hold mine?

466
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,042
- He does, Léna.
- How do you know?

467
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:39,802
I just know.

468
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:47,683
There's still no water.

469
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:51,122
Of course there isn't.
They keep turning it off.

470
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,002
This house is hell.

471
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:56,482
It's a good thing
you didn't bring Jonas.

472
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,162
- The trash is full.
- What's with the trash?

473
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:04,562
Nothing. They fill it up. They
stuffed it with 15 kg of raw chicken.

474
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:07,522
It'll soon be swarming with rats.

475
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:11,522
I was just downstairs.
The rats aren't coming.

476
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:28,522
Can we go now?

477
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,643
We can go.

478
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:38,362
Go where?

479
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:42,322
Where to?
To the award ceremony.

480
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:44,323
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

481
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:48,482
I'll put your nightgown
in the laundry basket.

482
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:52,483
- What are you taking?
- Your nightgown to the basket.

483
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,202
Take this to the laundry basket.

484
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:57,283
That's what I just said.

485
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:00,442
Everything slips my mind
these days.

486
00:50:15,442 --> 00:50:17,803
- Mama, what is it?
- I don't know.

487
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:21,043
Oh dear. Don't worry. I'll help.

488
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:24,202
- Oh my God.
- It's OK, come.

489
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:28,082
- See?
- Just step on these.

490
00:50:28,843 --> 00:50:31,963
One foot at a time.

491
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:37,843
My way from the gas chamber
to the stool chamber...

492
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:41,162
- You're not funny.
- I'm not funny?

493
00:50:41,282 --> 00:50:45,643
Well, you've got
a lot of shit in your life,

494
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:49,682
and I do too,
but mine is now literal.

495
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:53,722
It'd be silly to argue
whose pile of shit is bigger.

496
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,722
I wasn't arguing.
I'm just in a bad mood.

497
00:50:56,842 --> 00:50:58,322
Too bad.

498
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:14,762
Head to the park, everyone.

499
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:17,602
Yasmin, you too.
Head to the park.

500
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:21,122
- What's happened?
- I don't know. Head to the park.

501
00:55:22,562 --> 00:55:24,842
Come on, go to the park.

502
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:27,002
Don't post that.

503
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,562
Make way! Careful!

504
00:55:42,602 --> 00:55:44,602
Everything's OK.
Head to the park.

505
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,242
Someone still in there?

506
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:50,962
My class got out,
but Mr. Heinrich's is still inside.

507
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:53,962
To the park, everyone, go, go...

508
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:56,242
Everything's OK.

509
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:57,562
Go to the park.

510
00:56:01,682 --> 00:56:04,723
- Ms. Clausse, can we go home?
- Yes, school's over for today.

511
00:56:04,843 --> 00:56:06,523
- For real?
- No school today.

512
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,962
- You hear that? School is over!
- Is it gonna burn down?

513
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:11,162
- We can go home!
- Have you seen Jonas?

514
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:15,643
Don't post that.

515
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:21,043
Nora, where is Jonas?

516
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:22,243
Over there.

517
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:24,883
Is school over?

518
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:27,002
You should all head home.

519
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:31,603
Jonas. Can you give me
your father's phone number?

520
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,522
- What for?
- I can't reach your mother.

521
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:38,443
Because of my lantern?

522
00:56:38,803 --> 00:56:41,362
Yes, your lantern.
But let's not discuss this now.

523
00:56:41,803 --> 00:56:43,243
- I don't have it.
- What?

524
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:45,283
- His number.
- Why not?

525
00:56:46,562 --> 00:56:47,842
He's gone.

526
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:49,162
Understood.

527
00:57:47,722 --> 00:57:49,243
Cute bag you got there!

528
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:50,642
Nice color!

529
00:57:54,322 --> 00:57:58,202
Nice lantern colors too, Jonas.
Thanks for the day off, you wimp.

530
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,243
Where's your sister's hair gone?
Now she's your little brother.

531
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:09,283
Where are you going, sweetheart?
Come back.

532
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,442
Hey, can you give me a euro?
I want a burger.

533
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,122
Come on, man.

534
00:58:20,323 --> 00:58:23,563
- He won't even give me a euro!
- He's gotta have one euro somewhere.

535
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:25,802
- It's just one euro, dude.
- Come here.

536
00:58:29,642 --> 00:58:31,322
Don't lie to me ever again, OK?

537
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:32,962
The bus!

538
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:34,843
I knew you had money.

539
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:55,802
Thanks.

540
01:00:34,603 --> 01:00:37,603
- Why did you cut your hair?
- I didn't, Dad did.

541
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,083
Why?

542
01:00:39,163 --> 01:00:40,963
He doesn't like blue.

543
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:42,362
What does he like?

544
01:00:42,482 --> 01:00:44,162
Dark brown...

545
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:46,682
I like blue.

546
01:00:53,962 --> 01:00:56,282
- You coming this way?
- If it's OK with you.

547
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,642
I used to like boys,
but I don't anymore.

548
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:12,122
I'm not scared of them or anything.

549
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:16,322
- Are you scared of anything?
- No.

550
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:20,362
Of zombies or the apocalypse?

551
01:01:20,882 --> 01:01:21,882
No.

552
01:01:23,362 --> 01:01:25,442
You don't talk much, right?

553
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:28,682
Because your voice is breaking,
correct?

554
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:31,202
Yeah.

555
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:33,722
You wanna ask me anything?

556
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:39,242
Do you know "Rotten Person?"

557
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:41,362
- Who's that?
- A zombie.

558
01:01:44,122 --> 01:01:45,482
Do you have pets?

559
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,002
I do. A hamster.

560
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,202
Cool. What's his name?

561
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:50,562
Champion.

562
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:52,322
But he died.

563
01:01:53,602 --> 01:01:55,363
I don't know what to do with him.

564
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:58,082
- You wanna see him sometime?
- Yeah, sure.

565
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:01,483
My favorite café.

566
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:03,482
Blood orange, right?

567
01:02:04,802 --> 01:02:06,283
- Thanks.
- I'll get it.

568
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:26,323
They only had orange.

569
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:28,163
Thanks.

570
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:38,242
Want me to draw this on your hand?

571
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:40,482
Why not?

572
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,163
Over there.

573
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:16,202
You know,

574
01:03:16,522 --> 01:03:18,562
I'm happy
the school caught on fire.

575
01:03:20,962 --> 01:03:22,682
Not that it caught on fire,

576
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,603
because we...

577
01:03:26,522 --> 01:03:27,562
otherwise...

578
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:33,482
Oh, no. I have to go.

579
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:04,243
It was nice talking to you!

580
01:04:04,363 --> 01:04:06,883
Yasmin,
why are you later than your brother?

581
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:08,522
Go upstairs.

582
01:04:09,122 --> 01:04:11,683
- Is that your new chaperone?
- None of your business.

583
01:04:12,002 --> 01:04:13,802
You wanna live here or something?

584
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:41,002
Hey, brother!

585
01:08:58,603 --> 01:09:00,722
Not even a rag, nothing at all.

586
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:04,123
It'll take a while
until we're finished.

587
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:06,842
The edges are detailed work.

588
01:09:09,322 --> 01:09:10,562
Who's that?

589
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:13,363
Listen,
I almost had a heart attack.

590
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:15,323
I didn't know
he was already home.

591
01:09:16,243 --> 01:09:18,242
- Is he a freak or something?
- He's my child.

592
01:09:19,562 --> 01:09:20,562
Come on.

593
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:23,042
Come on.

594
01:09:29,162 --> 01:09:30,523
Where's my shirt?

595
01:09:30,643 --> 01:09:31,522
Over there.

596
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:32,642
Where?

597
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:34,483
Underneath.

598
01:09:37,243 --> 01:09:39,562
- It's late already.
- What?

599
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,962
I have to get back
to a meeting.

600
01:09:44,122 --> 01:09:45,242
Hurry up.

601
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,202
Daniel.

602
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:50,002
He's the restorer at the museum.

603
01:09:50,122 --> 01:09:51,122
Jonas.

604
01:09:51,322 --> 01:09:52,322
Yeah, well...

605
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,442
What a big boy you are.

606
01:09:56,203 --> 01:09:57,802
What's that wound of yours?

607
01:10:00,482 --> 01:10:02,002
- "Rotten Person."
- Come again?

608
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:03,163
Rotten person.

609
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,762
Oh, rotten person.

610
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:09,043
And how do you make
a wound like that?

611
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:12,442
With a sharp razor blade.

612
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:14,242
That's not funny!

613
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:25,322
Where's my scarf? I had a scarf.

614
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:28,282
Daniel, would you like
some coffee?

615
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:32,122
I'd prefer a sedative.

616
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,003
I'll find the scarf.

617
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:39,722
Oh, it's not that important.

618
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:46,963
Take good care of your mother.

619
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:00,322
Who was that fat guy?

620
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:01,562
An acquaintance.

621
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:03,602
He had a ring.

622
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:09,722
What does that mean,
he restares?

623
01:11:09,842 --> 01:11:11,323
He restores.

624
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,282
He fixes things up.

625
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:28,082
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- What are you doing here?

626
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:31,363
I'm hungry.

627
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:32,722
The school called.

628
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,682
What?
What did they say?

629
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:37,243
I couldn't pick up.
Did you do something?

630
01:11:37,363 --> 01:11:38,122
Why?

631
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,202
- What did you do?
- Why couldn't you answer?

632
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:42,722
What's up with your mouth?

633
01:11:43,123 --> 01:11:45,043
- My tooth is loose.
- Which tooth?

634
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:47,203
Your last baby tooth?

635
01:11:47,323 --> 01:11:48,323
Show me.

636
01:11:52,123 --> 01:11:54,242
- When is this finally coming out?
- I'll pull it.

637
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,563
Why did the school call?

638
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:00,523
A lantern caught on fire.

639
01:12:00,643 --> 01:12:01,843
What? Whose?

640
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,003
Did your lantern catch on fire?

641
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,683
- I think so.
- What?

642
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:07,522
- Did you light it up?
- No!

643
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:09,322
How did it catch on fire?

644
01:12:10,123 --> 01:12:11,123
Don't know.

645
01:12:11,323 --> 01:12:12,482
What do you mean?

646
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:17,443
During lunch, the fire alarm rang
and we were sent home.

647
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:19,123
And why?

648
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:21,562
- The school caught on fire.
- What? What?

649
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:24,002
And you're telling me this
only now?

650
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:25,363
What did you do?

651
01:12:25,483 --> 01:12:27,082
Look into my eyes.
What did you do?

652
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:28,603
Leave me alone!

653
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:35,162
- What are you doing?
- Leaving you alone.

654
01:12:35,282 --> 01:12:37,082
- Who are you calling?
- The school.

655
01:12:37,243 --> 01:12:38,962
- Don't.
- Then tell me what happened.

656
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:40,402
I don't know!

657
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,562
- They'll tell me.
- Mama, please.

658
01:12:42,682 --> 01:12:45,682
Tell me exactly
what happened with the lantern

659
01:12:45,802 --> 01:12:49,042
that I had the privilege
to make for you.

660
01:12:51,043 --> 01:12:53,402
- I took the lantern into school.
- What next?

661
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:56,482
- The teacher praised me.
- For what?

662
01:12:56,602 --> 01:12:58,603
- She said I was brave.
- Why brave?

663
01:12:59,002 --> 01:13:01,682
- Because of the kind of lantern.
- What kind?

664
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:05,042
What kind? You know that.
A Hanukkah lamp!

665
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:07,322
Was she nice or spiteful?

666
01:13:08,362 --> 01:13:09,283
Nice.

667
01:13:09,403 --> 01:13:10,322
And you?

668
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:12,202
- I didn't say anything.
- And her?

669
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:13,603
Nothing!

670
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,363
Man, you're really annoying!

671
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:22,003
She just told us to give the lanterns
to the first graders after school.

672
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:26,122
- And?
- Dress up warmly for the march.

673
01:13:26,242 --> 01:13:27,283
Yeah, and?

674
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:29,722
How do you know
it was your lantern?

675
01:13:29,962 --> 01:13:31,802
- What?
- That caught on fire!

676
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:38,762
The firefighters told me
only mine caught on fire.

677
01:13:40,922 --> 01:13:42,842
And that it was
probably an accident.

678
01:13:42,962 --> 01:13:47,203
Maybe a cigarette... It doesn't
matter! Don't you understand?

679
01:13:47,402 --> 01:13:49,882
Why do you always
make such a drama?

680
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:53,042
Besides,
I already get picked on all the time!

681
01:13:57,842 --> 01:13:58,882
<i>Ms. Clausse here.</i>

682
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:00,883
Hello, I'm Jonas' mother.

683
01:14:01,082 --> 01:14:03,322
Sorry for not being
available earlier.

684
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:07,882
I heard about the incident
and want to know what happened.

685
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:12,722
<i>This year, the "Smiling Germany"
initiative is supporting our school.</i>

686
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:17,002
<i>So it's in our common interest to
preserve the school's good reputation</i>

687
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:20,563
<i>and prevent incidents like this
from spreading.</i>

688
01:14:20,962 --> 01:14:24,283
Yeah, but what was
the incident?

689
01:14:24,763 --> 01:14:27,283
<i>Obviously,
that's a loaded question.</i>

690
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:28,723
What do you mean?

691
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:33,283
<i>We're of the opinion that
it was merely a thoughtless act</i>

692
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:36,362
<i>committed by a few students
and not...</i>

693
01:14:36,482 --> 01:14:40,003
- What was it?
<i>- ...with deep-rooted hostility.</i>

694
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,922
Hostility?
So you know who it was?

695
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:45,883
<i>I wouldn't want
to embarrass one of our students.</i>

696
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,802
Embarrass? It was arson.

697
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:52,442
<i>We should refrain
from making assumptions</i>

698
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:55,322
<i>people might want us to make.</i>

699
01:14:55,442 --> 01:14:56,962
What kind of assumption?

700
01:14:57,122 --> 01:15:00,442
<i>Listen, neither of us
will be able to resolve</i>

701
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:04,402
<i>Middle-Eastern conflicts
so many students suffer from.</i>

702
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:06,403
This is nonsense.

703
01:15:07,363 --> 01:15:09,562
What does my son
have to do with this?

704
01:15:11,683 --> 01:15:13,562
He's never been to Israel.

705
01:15:14,683 --> 01:15:16,562
He's not a soldier,
just a stupid kid.

706
01:15:16,802 --> 01:15:18,122
<i>- Exactly.</i>
- I'm not stupid!

707
01:15:18,242 --> 01:15:20,362
<i>As are the rest of the children.</i>

708
01:15:20,602 --> 01:15:23,443
<i>They don't even know
what they're talking about...</i>

709
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:24,482
Hang up.

710
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:27,002
<i>...they act out of ignorance,
not conviction.</i>

711
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:30,283
Who cares why they did it?
I sure don't.

712
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:33,082
The school could've burned down.

713
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:35,402
Someone should take responsibility.

714
01:15:35,522 --> 01:15:37,682
<i>- It's not about who's responsible...</i>
- Mama, hang up!

715
01:15:37,802 --> 01:15:39,802
<i>- ...the question is why they are.</i>
- Please!

716
01:15:39,922 --> 01:15:43,322
<i>We're cautious,
so no child can feel discriminated.</i>

717
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:47,882
I'm not discriminating anybody.
I'm asking if we were.

718
01:15:48,403 --> 01:15:52,082
We both know this isn't about
our children, but your school.

719
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:55,882
You're trying to politicize it
to avoid responsibility

720
01:15:56,002 --> 01:15:58,922
for what was done
to my child at school.

721
01:15:59,402 --> 01:16:02,882
It's your goddamn responsibility
to figure out what happened.

722
01:16:03,122 --> 01:16:06,802
<i>All we're able to see
is a childish prank.</i>

723
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:10,442
Are you able or are you willing?

724
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:14,002
Because you're afraid it could
hurt your school's reputation?

725
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:16,363
<i>No, this would mainly
hurt your child.</i>

726
01:16:16,483 --> 01:16:18,763
<i>We both know
incidents like this</i>

727
01:16:18,883 --> 01:16:22,202
<i>mostly happen to kids
with existing problems.</i>

728
01:16:22,442 --> 01:16:24,802
What problems?
Jonas doesn't have any problems!

729
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:28,843
I hate you!
I hate you!

730
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:05,162
What's wrong with you?
Turn that music off.

731
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:26,443
You're angry at me.

732
01:17:27,283 --> 01:17:28,723
- You're angry.
- I'm not angry.

733
01:17:29,162 --> 01:17:30,602
Yes, you're angry.

734
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:33,163
Yes, I'm angry
because you said you hate me.

735
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:36,283
- I was angry.
- For me doing your homework?

736
01:17:36,643 --> 01:17:40,042
I didn't want to do
the stupid homework, no one did.

737
01:17:40,442 --> 01:17:42,043
That wasn't even the right lamp.

738
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:44,842
It's your fault, and now you're...

739
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:47,563
- How is this my fault?
- You made it wrong. Get it?

740
01:17:47,683 --> 01:17:51,482
Can't you write
a fucking assignment down correctly?

741
01:17:51,763 --> 01:17:53,402
You wrote down...

742
01:17:53,722 --> 01:17:54,722
Look!

743
01:17:57,962 --> 01:17:59,803
You wrote:
"Homework:

744
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:02,042
"Symbols of the winter festival,

745
01:18:02,282 --> 01:18:03,682
"first graders lantern!"

746
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:06,802
No, look! Look!

747
01:18:06,922 --> 01:18:09,043
There's a comma! A comma!

748
01:18:09,482 --> 01:18:12,842
It was supposed to be a fucking
Martin's lamp, with a cross and...

749
01:18:12,962 --> 01:18:15,562
Never in my life
have I seen a goddamn Martin lamp!

750
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:17,402
How would I fucking know?

751
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:20,522
That's the problem!
You can't even read!

752
01:18:20,722 --> 01:18:23,923
You don't even know German!
You don't understand anything!

753
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:26,563
- I really don't!
- Exactly!

754
01:18:27,122 --> 01:18:30,682
Tomorrow I'll go to the principal
to finally understand!

755
01:18:32,642 --> 01:18:33,722
No.

756
01:18:34,562 --> 01:18:37,123
- Everyone will talk about it.
- What?

757
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:38,442
What?

758
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,242
- You're ashamed of...
- I'm not a Jew.

759
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:45,962
What are you then?

760
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,002
What are you then?

761
01:18:50,443 --> 01:18:51,682
What are you?

762
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:55,682
- Hungarian? German?
- You tell me. You brought me here.

763
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,202
You tell me what I am!

764
01:19:03,523 --> 01:19:05,122
Why are you like this?

765
01:19:05,563 --> 01:19:07,042
I still love you.

766
01:19:09,602 --> 01:19:12,242
I love you, too. I'm sorry.

767
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:16,642
- Since Grandma died...
- It's OK.

768
01:19:16,843 --> 01:19:17,843
It's OK.

769
01:19:18,202 --> 01:19:19,802
Don't come into school.

770
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:21,043
Don't.

771
01:19:21,802 --> 01:19:23,842
- You promise?
- I promise.

772
01:19:35,402 --> 01:19:36,602
I'll bake you a flódni.

773
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:37,762
What's that?

774
01:19:37,882 --> 01:19:39,403
The Jewish cake
Grandma always made.

775
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,922
- Would you like that?
- Sure.

776
01:19:43,682 --> 01:19:46,042
I'll bake you a whole tray,
for everyone,

777
01:19:46,442 --> 01:19:48,922
so you can share
at the St. Martin's parade. Alright?

778
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,162
Alright.

779
01:22:33,002 --> 01:22:36,962
- Hey you, come over here!
- Come over here, you coward!

780
01:22:39,202 --> 01:22:40,202
Fuck off!

781
01:23:24,523 --> 01:23:25,843
What are you doing there?

782
01:23:26,642 --> 01:23:27,642
Nothing.

783
01:23:34,682 --> 01:23:35,683
Look.

784
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:38,762
Champion?

785
01:23:40,642 --> 01:23:41,882
Wanna bury him?

786
01:23:46,603 --> 01:23:47,923
Yeah, why not?

787
01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:04,882
- You should sing for him.
- Sing what?

788
01:24:05,443 --> 01:24:06,682
What did he like?

789
01:24:07,162 --> 01:24:08,522
Ava Max.

790
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,002
- How about a prayer?
- What kind?

791
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,042
What did he believe in?

792
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:30,442
No clue.

793
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:34,282
- Where is he from?
- He was a Chinese dwarf hamster.

794
01:24:34,642 --> 01:24:36,002
So he was Chinese.

795
01:24:36,202 --> 01:24:37,682
But we bought him here.

796
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:39,283
So he's German?

797
01:24:40,603 --> 01:24:42,523
No clue.
Will you just say something?

798
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:44,483
No.

799
01:24:44,962 --> 01:24:46,123
Give me your hand.

800
01:24:48,122 --> 01:24:49,162
Dear Champion,

801
01:24:49,762 --> 01:24:51,442
it was nice to know you,

802
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,762
although only for a short time.

803
01:24:54,242 --> 01:24:56,242
May your god send you to rest.

804
01:24:57,322 --> 01:24:58,642
I wish you lots of...

805
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:01,100
- What was his favorite food?
- Chinese savoy cabbage.

806
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:04,802
Lots of Chinese savoy cabbage.
And may your soul rest in peace

807
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,483
in the eternal hunting grounds

808
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,602
or cabbage grounds

809
01:25:10,162 --> 01:25:11,602
or cabbage fields.

810
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,242
Let's get out of here.

811
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:27,442
- Jonas, what are you doing? Come on!
- Fuck.

812
01:25:27,562 --> 01:25:28,603
Come with us!

813
01:25:34,642 --> 01:25:37,003
It's nice you came. I'm glad.

814
01:25:37,963 --> 01:25:40,082
Yasmin, your class is back there.

815
01:25:41,482 --> 01:25:44,162
It'll be alright,
I've brought you a lantern, too.

816
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:45,682
A Martin's lantern.

817
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:47,923
- I made it for you.
- Thanks.

818
01:25:49,322 --> 01:25:51,442
Now you can hand it
to your mentee.

819
01:25:59,402 --> 01:26:03,002
Ah, Marie-Lou!
Now you'll get your lantern. Jonas!

820
01:26:07,522 --> 01:26:08,962
Hand it to her.

821
01:26:09,842 --> 01:26:12,163
Now take her hand,
like that.

822
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:19,963
<i>Up there, the stars are glowing</i>

823
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:22,922
<i>Down here we're glowing, too</i>

824
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:28,603
<i>I'm walking with my lantern</i>

825
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:31,682
<i>My lantern walks with me</i>

826
01:26:32,923 --> 01:26:36,643
<i>Up there the stars are glowing</i>

827
01:26:37,082 --> 01:26:40,123
<i>Down here, we're glowing too</i>

828
01:26:41,323 --> 01:26:45,122
<i>My light is out
I'm going home</i>

829
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:48,403
<i>Rabimmel, rabammel, rabumm</i>

830
01:26:54,002 --> 01:26:57,322
<i>Saint Martin, Saint Martin</i>

831
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:02,002
<i>Saint Martin
rode through snow and wind</i>

832
01:27:02,122 --> 01:27:06,082
<i>His horse, it carried him swiftly</i>

833
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:10,603
<i>Saint Martin rode with courage</i>

834
01:27:10,723 --> 01:27:14,803
<i>His jacket kept him warm and well</i>

835
01:27:18,202 --> 01:27:22,243
<i>In the snow, in the snow</i>

836
01:27:22,562 --> 01:27:26,563
<i>In the snow sat a poor man</i>

837
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:30,842
<i>Had no clothes, only tattered rags</i>

838
01:27:31,123 --> 01:27:35,203
<i>"Oh help me please

<i>Saint Martin draws his sword</i>

843
01:27:59,882 --> 01:28:03,922
<i>And cuts in half his warm coat</i>

844
01:28:15,562 --> 01:28:16,882
Wait. Come with me.
