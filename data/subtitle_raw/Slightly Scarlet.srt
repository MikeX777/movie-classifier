1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Good luck, sister.

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh, Dorothy.

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
All right honey, get
 it out of your system.

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's have a great
 big flood of tears.

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
You know what they
 told me in there?

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
They said if you'd
 paid the store

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
for what I took,
maybe I wouldn't

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
have had to serve time.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
You know how much it was, Dor.

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
I didn't have the money.

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm not blaming you, Junie.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm gonna take care of you now

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
and do all the things I should

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
have taken time to do before.

15
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
You mean, if
 there's a next time

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
you'll have the money?

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll have the money, but
 there won't be a next time.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,000
This
 all yours, June?

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Legally, I mean.

20
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
All mine, come on, climb in.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
I wish the dames
 in there could see

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
what a big success my sister is.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Let's get out of here.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Mm, Dorothy Lyons,
 first arrested

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
for petty theft,
 placed in custody

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
of sister June, two years later

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
arrested for shoplifting,
 six months paroled.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Two years ago arrested
 for jewelry theft.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Sentenced three to five
years, served 18 months.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Will be released because
 of ill health next Tuesday.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Today.

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
She'll be on
 parole, won't she?

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
For three years.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Thanks, Dave,
 I'll see you later.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Oh, just a minute Ben.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Forgot to tell me why
 you're so interested

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,600
in this girl.
 - Building a library.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Kind of a who's who.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
For Solly Caspar?

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
No, who's who for Ben Grace.

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
- Why, Ben?
 - Good idea.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Quite an idea.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Like to tell me about it?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,200
You'll hear about
 it soon enough.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
You're a dreamer, Ben.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Man's only as
 big as his dreams.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
We're gonna pull you
 out of the river some day.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
That's not part of the dream.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
By the way, did you ever dream

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
of being Chief of Police?

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Long time ago, lots of times.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
Maybe I'll make
 you Chief of Police.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
You got an in with the Mayor?

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Depends on which Mayor
you're talking about.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, Ben?

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
This dame, she's dynamite.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Yeah, thanks again.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Hop out.

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Ah, here we are, home at last.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Home, huh?

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
This is where you live.

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
Mmhmm, that's right,
now it's your home too.

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
You must be quite a secretary.

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
To a very successful man.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
- A bachelor?
 - Well, as it happens,

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Mr Jansen is a bachelor.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, Martha.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
I saw you drive up.

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,200
- This is my sister, Dorothy.
 - How do you do, Miss Dorothy.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Hi.

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, Martha, the
 flowers are lovely.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Mr Jansen's chauffeur
brought them over.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
No card.
- Any messages?

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
No, just the
 mail and the paper.

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
Join me?

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
No thanks, honey,
 not right now.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
- June?
- Mmhmm.

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
What are you gonna tell people

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
while I'm staying here with you?

80
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
That you're my sister.

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
And that I popped up
 from under a cabbage leaf?

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Nobody knows
 anything about you.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
And nobody will know
 anything about you.

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
And my probation officer?

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
That is all confidential.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Where I come from, you learn

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
to figure all the angles.

88
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Hey.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who's this?

90
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
That, is my
 boss, Frank Jansen.

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
He gave it to me a year ago.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
You gonna marry
 him, Junie, or.

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Do you think I should?

94
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I think it's a very good idea.

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
The bathroom towels'll
 look sensational.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,200
JJ.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
When I want a new
 monogram, I'll let

98
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Frank Jansen know.

99
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Don't you wanna shower
 and see your room?

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Hot water, soap, clean sheets.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
Come on, sweetie,
 I'll show it to you.

102
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Know where I was

103
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
yesterday at this time?

104
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
In a sewing room
with six hundred

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
dames making denim uniforms.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Let's not talk
 about that ever again.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
You're here now
 and you're starting

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
a new life and neither of us has

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
a worry in the world.

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Hi, Ben, Solly's
 watching television.

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Thanks.

112
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Bout
 time you showed up.

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Solly's been asking for ya.
 - So I'm here.

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
This
Marlowe's getting rough.

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
I've published a
 newspaper in Bay City

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
for 30 years and
 never have I used

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
its columns for a crusade that

118
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
I thought was more
 important than

119
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,800
the one to elect
 Frank Jansen Mayor.

120
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,200
Obviously, the city
 government is rotten.

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Rotten, corrupt, evil.

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Well everyone in City Hall knows

123
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
who actually's running our city.

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Sol Caspar, and when
Sol Caspar doesn't steal

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
he bribes, and when he
 doesn't bribe, he murders.

126
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
For 15 years his
 syndicate of vice

127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
has grown and grown and grown

128
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,000
because the men
 elected to protect you

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
from crime have been on
Sol Caspar's payroll.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
I urge you, I beg you.

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Sol, how's Marlowe
 get away with that?

132
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Shut up, I wanna hear this.

133
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
To elect a man who's
never been in politics.

134
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
A man who is free from
 ties to politicians

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,000
and gangsters, a man who
will clean up Bay City.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ladies and Gentlemen, vote
 for Frank Jansen for mayor.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, Ben, come
 on in the office.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
Who dealed them?

139
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Glad to see you,
 genius, that Marlowe

140
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
is a rough old man.

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,200
You must have a file this
 thick on Jansen's girlfriend.

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
I got a file, Solly.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
And I knocked the boy
 scout right outta the box.

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
I told ya there was a
 way to get to anybody.

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,400
A way to get to a
reformer, just to prove

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,800
that he's not such a
 lily white angel himself.

147
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
That figures.

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Well what do we use, genius?

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Pictures of him,
 tapes, check zeroed?

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I gotta file on
 Jansen's girlfriend.

151
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,400
All it proves is that they're
 both clean as a whistle.

152
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
You been working on em a week.

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
If she's clean, she's clean.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't help it if
 Jansen's too smart

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to leave any tracks.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh this is great.

157
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
This is fine news to
 get at ten o'clock

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,200
Tuesday night, a
 week before election.

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,800
Do you know what
 happens to bright boys

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
like you and us
 if Jansen gets in?

161
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
You can take all
 your fancy gimmicks

162
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
and your camera
 rifle and you can,

163
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
a dame is a dame, there's bound

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
to be something you
 can nail her on.

165
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
I couldn't get one
 picture of June Lyons.

166
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
You mean you didn't
 even get a picture

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
of her coming out of his
 house at two in the morning?

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
What kind of a secretary is she?

169
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Probably a nice secretary.

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Maybe a nice girl.

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
If you wanna nail
 Jansen, you better try

172
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
something else, something good.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You may be right, genius.

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
If I can't get the
 girl alongside Jansen,

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,800
I'll get the guy behind him.

176
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Marlowe?

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Marlowe.

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Without the journal,
 nobody'd ever

179
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,400
have known about Frank Jansen.

180
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
I'd advise you to take it easy

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
where Marlowe's concerned.

182
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You'd advise me.

183
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I'm gonna take care
 of Marlowe tonight.

184
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
You're coming with me.

185
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Uh-uh Solly, count me out.

186
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
What's the matter, rough stuff

187
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
not in your line or something?

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Scare ya, genius.

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
No, it doesn't scare me.

190
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
I don't believe in it.

191
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
If you're smart, you
 don't have to use it.

192
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
So I'm not smart?

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
You're a bright boy, genius, and

194
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm glad to have
 you working for me.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
But you know why you'll always

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
be working for me
 and not vice versa?

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why, Solly?

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,200
An operator, he runs things.

199
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Up, down, sideways, rain
 or shine, he runs things.

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
You got no jet
 engine in your belly

201
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
that makes you operate.

202
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
You'd rather read a
 couple of good books,

203
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,800
wouldn't you, genius, wait,
 I'll show you something.

204
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Lenhardt, all you
 fellas, come in here.

205
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Boys, I called you
 in here to give you

206
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,000
a demonstration of
 how I'm gonna operate

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
on Mr. Norman B. Marlowe.

208
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Genius, you're just
 a chiseller out

209
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
for a soft buck,
 you're not crooked

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and you're not
 straight, you take

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
what you can get
 where you can get it

212
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
but you don't want any trouble.

213
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
You'll die at age 66 in bed with

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
three grand in the
 bank but you'll never

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
be an operator, now
 go on out and get

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
yourself some
 fresh air but don't

217
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
let it go to your head.

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Remind me never to
send my son to college.

219
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,400
That is, if I ever have a son.

220
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Sure, Jansen's honest.

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,400
Even if he gets
 elected, so what?

222
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,600
He don't understand politics.

223
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
In six months, they'll
 have time tied up too

224
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,400
I've seen em come and go, why

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
this town'll be so lily
white you'll be able

226
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
to eat your dinner
 off the pavement here.

227
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
- Hello?
 - Hello, Miss June Lyons?

228
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
- Yes.
 - Listen carefully to what

229
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
I have to say,
 Solly Caspar's gonna

230
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
take care of Norman
 Marlowe tonight.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Call Jansen, tell
 him to warn him,

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
better still, warn him yourself.

233
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't lose a minute.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Who is this?

235
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
- A friend.
- Why don't you

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,800
tell him yourself, who are you?

237
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Hello?

238
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Hello!

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Who's that?

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
Nothing, honey,
 go back to sleep.

241
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
I thought I heard
 a man's voice.

242
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Probably just
 some political crank

243
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
trying to cause trouble.

244
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Why didn't you get his number?

245
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
I wish you had.

246
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
The men elected to
 protect you from crime

247
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
have been on Sol
 Caspar's payroll.

248
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you, Gloria,
 thank you for working

249
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
so late and goodnight.

250
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
Mr. Marlowe?

251
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
Good night, Mr. Marlowe.

252
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Just a little talk, Marlowe.

253
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Caspar!

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
You.

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Well now we, we can
 discuss anything tomorrow.

256
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm a sick man, my
doctor's just warned me.

257
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
You'll talk about me
 whenever you want to,

258
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm talking to you now.
- You can't frighten me

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
you can't stop me.
 - You're going to stop

260
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
backing Jansen,
 you're gonna stop

261
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
printing all that
 stuff about me.

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm gonna print all the truth

263
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
about your vicious scheming.

264
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Rich boy, you're gonna
stop, or you'll get

265
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
a working over like
 those newspaper boys

266
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
in Scenic City, now we talk.

267
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Listen to me.

268
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Get some water.

269
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
- Looks like he's dead.
 - Don't make a Federal case

270
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
out of it, get some water.

271
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,600
It's too late for
 water, you killed him.

272
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
You sure?

273
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Guess I did at that, didn't I?

274
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Well, that's getting out
of a jam the hard way.

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Open the window.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Give him some air.

277
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,400
Give him plenty of air.

278
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
Come on, let's see if
 we can beat him down.

279
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
I was half asleep,
 I looked at the clock

280
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
a little before
 two, I thought about

281
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,800
calling you, Frank,
 but who takes

282
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
a phone call seriously
 at that hour?

283
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,400
Now this horrible murder.

284
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Phone call in the
 middle of the night

285
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
doesn't prove
murder, Miss Lyons.

286
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Well it's just too
 much of a coincidence.

287
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Lieutenant, you
 don't see to be

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
very anxious to dig into this.

289
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
What else could it
 be but a murder?

290
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Mr. Marlowe was your friend.

291
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,200
He was backing you,
 of course you're going

292
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,000
to jump to conclusions,
me, I take it

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
a little easier, I
 don't mess around

294
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,600
with politics or politicians.

295
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,000
That's how I've lasted 22
 years in the department.

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Thanks, Miss Lyons, I
 know how to reach you.

297
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Are you sure you didn't
 recognize the voice?

298
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Could it have been
someone from the office?

299
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Maybe if I heard it
again I'd recognize it.

300
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm sorry, Frank, but it
all seems to fantastic.

301
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't blame yourself,
June, you probably

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
couldn't have done
 anything about it anyway.

303
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
- Thanks.
 - I've gotta get downtown.

304
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm glad you were
 here with me anyhow.

305
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
See you this afternoon.

306
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
- Bye.
 - Buh bye.

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Lieutenant!

308
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
You know, I don't
 think that policeman

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
believed a word I said.

310
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,200
They never believe anybody.

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
Come on, let's get some sun!

312
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
- Yes?
 - Good morning, Miss Lyons.

313
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Remember me?

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, can't say that I do.

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Name's Ben Grace.

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
What do you want?

317
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
I want Frank Jansen for mayor.

318
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Oh, come in.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Mm, nice looking
 place you have here.

320
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,600
Thank you.

321
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Nice looking girl.

322
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Supposing you tell
 me why you're here.

323
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
All right Miss Lyons,
I'll get to the point.

324
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Last night I telephoned
you about Marlowe.

325
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
You.

326
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,200
I wouldn't bother,
 I waited till

327
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,000
they drove away.

328
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,600
How did you know?

329
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
I knew, that's enough.

330
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,600
- But.
 - Mr Jansen is a nice man.

331
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
But he doesn't know
 how to win elections.

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not a very nice
 man, I know how.

333
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Takes a little dirt.

334
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,800
And you have dirt to sell?

335
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,000
I have dirt to sell.

336
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What do you want for it?

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Money?

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Not a penny.

339
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
What then?

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Oh, decency.

341
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Clean government,
Frank Jansen for mayor.

342
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Jansen's an idealist.

343
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
You're a practical girl.

344
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,200
He needs you and you've
made him pay for it.

345
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
Oh, that's all right,
 I don't trust people

346
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
who are not a little greedy.

347
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
What do you want to tell me?

348
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Did you know Marlowe?

349
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,400
Yes.

350
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Sit down.

351
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Listen.

352
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
You're going
to stop backing Jansen.

353
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
You're going to stop
printing all that stuff

354
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
about me.
 - I'm going to print

355
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,600
all the truth about
 your vicious, evil.

356
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,800
Listen to me!

357
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,000
Get some water.

358
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
It's too late for water.

359
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
You killed him.

360
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Where did you
 get this, Mr Grace?

361
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,600
It's not a question
 of where I got it.

362
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,800
It's what you and Jansen
are gonna do with it.

363
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Uh-uh, I don't buy
 your villain goods.

364
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
Who sent you to me?

365
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,800
Sol Caspar himself?

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,200
I assure you, this is genuine.

367
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
All I can do is give you a gun.

368
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
If you haven't got guts enough

369
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
to pull the trigger,
 I can't help it.

370
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
No dirt, tonight, Mr. Grace.

371
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
I don't like your brand.

372
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's too cheap, it smells like

373
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,200
some kind of trick, you probably

374
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
invented it for some.
 - Oh, there's too much

375
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,400
to invent, for instance,
there's your sister

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
out there, her
 first arrest was for

377
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,800
petty larceny, then
 two years later

378
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,000
the rap was for shop lifting.

379
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Get out of this house.

380
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
Now do you believe me?

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I don't like
 blackmail, I said

382
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
get out and I mean it.

383
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm in the book.

384
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,200
Name is Ben Grace, G-R-A-C-E.

385
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll let Mr. Jansen
 decide if he needs you,

386
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
but I assure you,
 my sister and I.

387
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
Somebody talking about me?

388
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I'd much rather do the
 talking for myself.

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Goodbye, Mr. Grace.

390
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
How do you do, Mr. Grace.

391
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Meet Junie's little
 sister, Dorothy.

392
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Hello Miss Lyons.

393
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,800
Please cal me Dor, won't you?

394
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,600
A frank and open door.

395
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Dorothy, Mr.
 Grace is very late.

396
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey, I love that material.

397
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,800
I love the feel of it.

398
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
I'll wear it the
 next time I see you.

399
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, you don't
 have to put it on

400
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,200
just for me.

401
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Your sister's a nice girl.

402
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
And she's going
 to stay that way.

403
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Remember, the
 number's expert 36567.

404
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
- Expert 36567.
- You got it.

405
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,600
You tired too?

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Not too much, honey.

407
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,600
I guess I just have an
 awful lot on my mind.

408
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
A lovely girl like
 you, you shouldn't

409
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,200
have to worry about
 a thing, except

410
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
looking beautiful
 and running home

411
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
to a man who loves you.
- Thank you.

412
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
I guess I could have
timed this a bit better.

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We'll set up a more
 romantic atmosphere.

414
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Fiddles playing
 offstage, bongo drums

415
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
and all that sort of
 thing, but really.

416
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
Why don't we get
married and stop

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,800
all this foolishness?
 - Oh, Frank, not now.

418
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,600
Not right away, will
 you hold the offer

419
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,400
open for a while?

420
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
In other words, no?

421
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
No, I don't mean
 no, I just can't think

422
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,800
about it right now, I
 wanna get Dorothy settled.

423
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Preferably some
 place away from here

424
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
where she might not embarrass

425
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
her prominent brother-in-law.

426
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
You've known about her?

427
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
What difference does it make?

428
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
I wanna marry you
 because I love you.

429
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
She has nothing to do with it.

430
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
So if that's the only reason,

431
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
there's no reason
 at all anymore.

432
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
I know there isn't another man.

433
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
No, of course not.

434
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
May I come in?

435
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
The door's open.

436
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,400
what made you change your mind?

437
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Well, I talked it
 over with Mr. Jansen.

438
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
After all, if it's
 what you say it is.

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
What can you tell me that
 will help elect Mr. Jansen?

440
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
Well, aside from Solly Caspar,

441
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
who's a low grade moron
 with delusions of grandeur

442
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
there's Wilson and
 James, they were

443
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
in the room when
 Marlowe was killed.

444
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
The FBI's been looking for
 those boys for a long time.

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
The Blue Gross is
 up 4% over last month

446
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
or 220,000, and
 this is the green,

447
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Mr. Caspar, it's down a little,

448
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,600
but all in all
 everything seems to be

449
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
running well ahead.
 - Yeah, what do you

450
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
want, genius?
 - Your boyfriend Jansen's

451
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,200
on TV, I thought you
 might like to look.

452
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
Well, why not watch
 the clown for a while.

453
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Okay, Ames, thanks,
 go on, hit the books

454
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
for that fancy degree, you know,

455
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
it's a pleasure having
 geniuses in the organization.

456
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
I had a speech prepared
 for this last address

457
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,200
before you go to
 the polls, but after

458
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
thinking about it all day,
 I decided not to use it.

459
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Instead, I'd like to
 talk for a few minutes

460
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,000
about a crime which shocked
 all of us yesterday.

461
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
A crime that should
 be the concern

462
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
of the Chief of Police
 and the District Attorney

463
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,800
but which, for some
 strange reason,

464
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
they don't seem to
 want to look into.

465
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
The crime, ladies and gentlemen,

466
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,500
the murder of Norman Marlowe.

467
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,100
The criminal,
 ladies and gentleman

468
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,500
that leader of all that
is vile and corrupt

469
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,700
in our city, and one
 whose influence obviously

470
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,500
reaches into the City
 Hall itself, Solly Caspar.

471
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
How'd he get that?

472
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Please, please,

473
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
you know I wouldn't say
anything to anybody.

474
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Not about a murder.

475
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
You know too much, Gloria!

476
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
Maybe you talked too much!

477
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Wilson, James,
 you're under arrest!

478
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Get him out of here.

479
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Take em out!

480
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It was a
 good tip, Mr. Caspar.

481
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Chief went out and acted
on his own authority.

482
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
Mr. Caspar, from
 where I sit, I'd say

483
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,400
you better get outta
 town, maybe the state.

484
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Maybe the country.

485
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,800
You tell the man
 on top he better

486
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
cover for me all the way.

487
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Say, Boss, Wilson
 and James have been

488
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
shooting off their
 mouths all morning.

489
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,000
There's 9000 pages
 of stuff up at

490
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the State's Attorney's office.

491
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Sure stinks, doesn't it, boys?

492
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
Who gave em the word, Sol?

493
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
The more I think
 of it, the more

494
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,800
it figures maybe
 bright boy did get

495
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
some big ideas.
 - If Ben Grace is that

496
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
stupid it would be
 a personal pleasure.

497
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,200
No, not you, not anybody else.

498
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Let the genius go ahead.

499
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,600
Give him rope, if it
 was him, I'll be back.

500
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
I'll be back to do
 the sweetest job

501
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,600
on the genius you ever saw.

502
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,200
I got 40 minutes to
make it to the airport.

503
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Quiet!

504
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
Quiet everybody, please!

505
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,800
An announcement
 from the news room.

506
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Mayor Robbins concedes defeat.

507
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Here's to the new mayor.

508
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,800
Everybody'll
 wonder where I went.

509
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Oh it's so good just
 to sit here with you

510
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,400
and relax and try to
 realize it's all over.

511
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
How does it feel
 to back a winner?

512
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
You oughta know.

513
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
You know, the strangest
thing for me tonight.

514
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,800
All those people
 I don't know them,

515
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,400
they don't know
 me, all of a sudden

516
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,600
I realized that you
 and I and Frank,

517
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
all of us are were
 really working

518
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
like the devil for them, to help

519
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
somebody else
I don't think

520
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,600
I was ever that
 altruistic before.

521
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
You talk too much.

522
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Why'd you do that?

523
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
To see what you'd do.

524
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And how'd I do?

525
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,600
You did fine.

526
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Hey!

527
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
You know, I don't
 know you at all.

528
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,200
Ben Grace Investments,
and I haven't been able

529
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,800
to find out anything, either.

530
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,200
I made one good investment
 for you, didn't I?

531
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,000
Mmhmm, when do I get the bill?

532
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Maybe it's on the house.

533
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What?

534
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I was just thinking.

535
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,300
Poor Frank, mayor
 elect and all night

536
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,100
people have been
 buttonholing him for favors

537
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,500
and from now on,
 everybody'll want something

538
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
from him.
 - And you've been

539
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,900
playing hooky.
 - Mmhmm and I don't think

540
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
I can write a very
 good excuse, either.

541
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,500
Want to do him a favor?

542
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Certainly.

543
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,700
Tell him to put Dave Dietz in

544
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
as the new Chief of Police.

545
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Dave Dietz?

546
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,100
Mm, he's a good man.

547
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,500
I thought he was one
of the City Hall bunch.

548
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Well, he's a good
 lieutenant who maybe

549
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,100
never had a chance to do the job

550
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,500
he'd like to, best
 you could find.

551
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,500
Well, you've been
 batting a thousand so far.

552
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,900
I'll think about it.

553
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
- Goodnight.
 - Goodnight, Ben.

554
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
Why didn't you invite him in?

555
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,700
Oh, don't look
 around for Martha,

556
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,500
she kept her eye on me for you

557
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
but she clocked off hours ago.

558
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,700
All right honey,
 come on, let's get

559
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,300
to bed, it's late.

560
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,500
Oh, I heard the
 good news about

561
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,300
the election.
 - Oh?

562
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,500
- Congratulations.
 - Thanks.

563
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
- Jansen called up.
 - Oh did he?

564
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
- Twice.
- Oh.

565
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Wondered what had
 happened to you.

566
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
Very disappointed.

567
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
It runs in the family.

568
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
What's that?

569
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Having people
 just elected mayor

570
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
calling you up all
 hours of the night.

571
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
Good deal.
 - Oh it is.

572
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
Especially when you're spending

573
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,400
all hours of the night
 with somebody else.

574
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Aren't you asleep yet?

575
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm not sleepy.

576
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,000
Do you want something?

577
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
- Yes.
 - A glass of hot milk?

578
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Ben Grace.

579
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Oh sweetie.

580
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
You don't really.

581
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,000
He just happens to
 be the first man

582
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you've talked to in a long time.

583
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Look, I don't expect
 you to understand

584
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,800
my feelings, all
 head and no heart,

585
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
planning every move
 to better yourself.

586
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm not like you,
 I've got a heart.

587
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,000
And I've gotta do
 what it tells me

588
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,800
no matter what.

589
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
How long are we
 going to sit around

590
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
waiting for that guy
 to tell us what to do?

591
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I got news for you guys,

592
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,000
nobody's gonna
 tell me what to do.

593
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
But, if I were running
 this organization.

594
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,600
What would you do, Giant?

595
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,400
I'll tell ya
 what I'd do, Tiny.

596
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,000
I'd won a lottery,
 that's what I'd do.

597
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,200
Everybody likes the
 lottery, everybody

598
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
and I'd split the take
 right down to the middle.

599
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,000
One fifth of the
 payoff in charity

600
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,400
and one fifth for the boys.

601
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
What about the
 other three fifths?

602
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Well, a guy's
 gotta get something

603
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,400
for his big ideas.

604
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What's the
 scoop, the play,

605
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,400
what are we doing, genius?

606
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,800
We're not doing
 anything for a while.

607
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,000
Maybe you ain't,
 but we're taking up

608
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,200
where Solly left off.

609
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,400
You'll end up in jail.

610
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
If you goons read the newspapers

611
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,800
instead of the comic
 books, you'd find out

612
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,600
we have a new city
 administration.

613
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Look, don't go
 Joe College on us.

614
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,000
We know what's happened
just the same as you do.

615
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,800
I want time for
 everything to settle down.

616
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,400
And I don't want
you knuckleheads

617
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
screwing up my plans.

618
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,200
- Your plans?
 - You heard it right

619
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,000
the first time.
- So you're the planning

620
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
commission now?
- That's right.

621
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm the planning commission.

622
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
Pretty smart.

623
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
How'd you get in so
good with the new mayor?

624
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,800
I went to the library
and read a book.

625
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,600
I see, thanks for telling me.

626
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,900
All right now
 get this straight.

627
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,100
We're staying out of
 the rackets for now.

628
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
You wanna know something, Ben?

629
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,100
Why don't you shut
 up when I'm talking.

630
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,700
I didn't hear a word you said,

631
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
I must be getting deaf.

632
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,800
All right Grannar, I'll
 say it again for you.

633
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
Nothing moves till I say so.

634
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,200
Until the first snow, is that

635
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,000
what you said, genius,
 ha, he doesn't want

636
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,800
anybody screwing up his plans,

637
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
stay out of the rackets till I.

638
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
I may have to kill you, Lenny.

639
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't like killing
 people, never did.

640
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,400
But you're not
 people, I don't think

641
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
I'd mind a bit.
- You talk big.

642
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Solly was a big operator.

643
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,200
Yeah, I know Solly was
 big operator, jet propelled.

644
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,200
I'm gonna handle things
a little different.

645
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
Anybody can talk.

646
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,200
I can deliver too.

647
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,000
What did you
 deliver lately, Benji?

648
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
City hall.

649
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,800
I got it unlocked with
 an old friend of mine.

650
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,000
The new Chief of
 Police, Dave Dietz

651
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
is gonna be the
 boy with the star.

652
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,200
And Lenny, you'd be
 impossible to miss.

653
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,000
You're not much of
 a Chief of Police

654
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,600
if you can't pull enough
 rank to get a better office.

655
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,400
Next week.

656
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Ben, I, don't know what
to say except that.

657
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Well, however you did it,
 you know I'm grateful.

658
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah.

659
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
You bring this?

660
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Your first bribe.

661
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,600
I just came from Jansen's.

662
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
He's gonna be all right, Ben.

663
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
I think everything's
 gonna be all right.

664
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
Wanna listen to me?

665
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Sure, Ben, shoot.

666
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
You may be the richest
 cop in 11 western states.

667
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Oh?

668
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Jansen's gonna be
 happy, the voters

669
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
are gonna be happy,
 as a matter of fact

670
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
it's gonna be one
 big happy family.

671
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
Nice, if you can do it.

672
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,400
I can do it, meantime
you do your job,

673
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,200
clean up the city,
 stop prostitution,

674
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,400
nail the thieves
and the grifters

675
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,000
and make the taxpayers feel safe

676
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,200
in their beds at night.
- What's in it for you?

677
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
Oh I'll take a 30,
 nice, clean, quite

678
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
gambling locations
 where the suckers

679
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,200
can lose their money to
their hearts content.

680
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,000
No trouble, simple.

681
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Just let them throw their
 money at little Benji.

682
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Playing both ends against
 the middle, aren't ya?

683
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Of course, I like you Dave,
 we understand one another.

684
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,800
You forget two things.

685
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
Frank Jansen's got
 six million dollars.

686
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,400
He owes nobody nothing.

687
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,800
He can pick up the
 phone real easy

688
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
and tell his Chief of
 Police to close down

689
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,400
those nice, 30 locations.

690
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,600
And you also forget
 Solly's boys.

691
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,900
They're likely to jam
 you in a barrel of cement

692
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,100
and dump it in the Bay.

693
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,700
Nice of you to worry
 about me, Dave, but don't.

694
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,700
I got it figured
 right down the line.

695
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,900
Apparently there's
 some confusion

696
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,500
all the way down
 the line, Mr. Grace,

697
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
with the election and all
 and Mr Caspar leaving.

698
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,700
That might account
 for the lower figures.

699
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,900
You worry about
 the books, Ames,

700
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I'll worry about the reasons.

701
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,500
Oh yes sir, I didn't
 mean to say that.

702
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,900
Oh, Mr. Grace, what do
 you hear about Mr. Caspar?

703
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I mean the word is
 that he's in Mexico.

704
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,100
That's as good a place as any

705
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,900
if you're up for a
 Grand Jury indictment.

706
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,900
How much cash do we have?

707
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Personal?

708
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
You mean Mr Caspar's?

709
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,500
Well, the last audit I
 remember three months ago

710
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,100
Mr. Caspar had 160,000 on hand.

711
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,900
Hmm, where is it?

712
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,500
Why I imagine the beach house.

713
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,100
I think we better get it out.

714
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,900
Oh I can't get
 to it, Mr. Grace.

715
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
I'll talk to you
 about it later.

716
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,300
Hold all the
 appointments, Betsy,

717
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,900
Mrs. McCullough's
coming by to pick me up

718
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,500
and I'm not even dressed yet.

719
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,700
Come in!

720
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,500
Mrs McCullough here already?

721
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,300
Not exactly.

722
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,700
Don't tell me
 other people see you

723
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,100
this early in the morning.

724
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,300
Hi there,
you're hard to contact.

725
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,900
- Mmm.
 - Sit down.

726
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,500
- Coffee Mr. Grace?
 - No thanks.

727
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,900
- I'll be there shortly.
- Miss Lyons, it's

728
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,700
nine o'clock.
 - Oh, you better get started

729
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,900
with Miss Dorothy
 if she's ready.

730
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,700
Oh I'm sorry I look like this.

731
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,500
Couldn't you have
 telephoned first?

732
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,100
I like to send my
 thanks yous in person.

733
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,900
Thanks for putting
 Dave Dietz in.

734
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
You won't be disappointed.

735
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Ben, Frank wants very
badly to talk with you.

736
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,500
I have to drive
 up the coast today.

737
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,100
Isn't he satisfied?

738
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,700
Naturally.

739
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,500
He just wants to meet the
 man who made it possible.

740
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,100
I'll buy him lunch sometime.

741
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,100
After I've bought
 you three or four.

742
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,300
Mm, if I had my choice,
 I'd prefer dinner.

743
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,700
Have you and Junie
 settled the problems

744
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
of the world?

745
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Couple of em.

746
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,900
You all ready to go, Dor?

747
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,300
Martha said so.

748
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,300
The appointment at Dr.
 Mapes is for 9:30, isn't it?

749
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,900
And don't forget,
 Martha will wait for you.

750
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,100
Looks like everybody's
clearing out.

751
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,100
I'll see you later, you two.

752
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,900
Oh, are you driving somewhere?

753
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,100
Well then you can drop me,

754
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
no need to bother Martha at all.

755
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,900
Oh honey, all our
 plans have been made.

756
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,500
Oh it's right on Ben's
way, the Professional

757
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,700
Building on Woodward,
 the doctor's gonna

758
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
check my eyes.
- I'll drop her off.

759
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,900
Oh Ben, you're
 busy, and, Dorothy,

760
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,700
how would you get home?

761
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,900
Oh, he'll drop
 me at the doctors,

762
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,100
I'll take a taxi home,
 don't you trust me?

763
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,700
Miss Lyon's residence.

764
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,900
It's Mrs. McCullough.

765
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,500
Yes?

766
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,100
Oh yes dear, I'll be waiting.

767
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,300
I thought you'd
 maneuvered us together

768
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,700
long before this.
 - Maneuver?

769
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,100
I didn't maneuver anything.

770
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,500
I knew the first
 minute I looked at you

771
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,700
we'd end up together,
 and so did you.

772
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,300
What made you so sure?

773
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,300
We're two of a kind, both bad.

774
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,900
Cigarette please.

775
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,700
Look, kid, we've
 both got things to do.

776
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,900
Don't you think you
 should get in there?

777
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,300
You did know I was going to
 a head shrinker, didn't you?

778
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,700
Nope, but it sounds
like a heck of an idea.

779
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,300
You're quite a problem.

780
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,100
Wanna solve me?

781
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Hey, the lighter.

782
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
I'll give it back.

783
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,900
Come again.

784
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,100
You crazy!

785
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,500
You play rough, don't you?

786
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,100
Oh I can play smooth.

787
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,500
Hey!

788
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,500
Hey!

789
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,900
Where you going,
 the Professional
 Building's back there.

790
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,900
I'm not going in
 for that couch fit.

791
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,300
Can't go home for
 a couple of hours,

792
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,700
so I thought I'd take a
look around the stores.

793
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,100
How'd you like to drive
 to the beach with me?

794
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,100
The best offer I've had today.

795
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,500
Hey, what place is this?

796
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Used to be a road house,
 now it's a beach house.

797
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,300
Hey.

798
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,400
This is a beach house?

799
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,800
How about that?

800
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,400
Smooth.

801
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
What a layout.

802
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,400
Ah, ah.

803
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
This.
 - Solly liked

804
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,400
the simple things,
 he liked girls too.

805
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,400
Should we see if it fits?

806
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Sure, try it on.

807
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,600
If it doesn't fit,
 the closets upstairs

808
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,400
are full of em.

809
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Eenie, meanie, minie, mo.

810
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,200
You go on upstairs and change.

811
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,200
Over there, I'll see you later.

812
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,600
No argument.

813
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,400
I won't be long.

814
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,600
Yep!

815
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,600
I got ya covered!

816
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Put the thing
 down, it's dangerous.

817
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
This little thing?

818
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,400
You screwballed little idiot!

819
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,800
Haven't you got any sense?

820
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,000
You could kill somebody
with that thing!

821
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,600
You play rough too.

822
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,400
I told you we were the same.

823
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,400
I should have skipped
 Dr. Mapes weeks ago.

824
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Come here.

825
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,600
Go take a swim,
 cool off a little.

826
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,000
Just a little.

827
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,000
Beach is down there.

828
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,000
I hope we won't
 be interrupted.

829
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Solly's in Mexico.

830
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,000
Cut it out.

831
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,000
- June ever been here, Benji?
 - No.

832
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,200
Score one for little sister.

833
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,400
Do you have any
 idea what time it is?

834
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
On Dr. Mapes couch
 I watch the clock.

835
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
On your couch?

836
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,000
Come here.

837
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Here, take my car
 and get out of here.

838
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,200
Meet me at the Medical building.

839
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,600
No arguments.

840
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,400
Hold it right there, baby.

841
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,600
I said freeze.

842
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,200
You want your girlfriend
to get it, Ben?

843
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
Do as he says.

844
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,000
Get outta here!

845
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,200
Solly sent bail for James too.

846
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,200
He'll take care of
 you, bright boy.

847
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,800
Solly Caspar?

848
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,800
You idiot.

849
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,000
Get up.

850
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Solly went bail, I went
bail for both of ya.

851
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,800
Here's a receipt.

852
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,400
Read it.

853
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,600
Ben I, I didn't know.

854
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,200
All right, now you know.

855
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,400
Get outta here, go
 the way you came.

856
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,600
How is she?

857
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,400
She's fine, she's asleep.

858
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,200
I'll run along.

859
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,000
She uh, she talked a lot,
 before she went to sleep.

860
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
All about this afternoon.

861
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,800
What about this afternoon?

862
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,800
The beach house, what went on.

863
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,600
You two, she said enough.

864
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
And you believed her?

865
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,400
I don't know what to believe.

866
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Believe me, it's you I want.

867
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,200
Are you sure you
 don't want both of us?

868
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Oh Ben, hold me, don't
 let me go, hold me tight.

869
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
Hello Martha.

870
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Pralines for my
sister, she loves them.

871
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,600
How is she?

872
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh, she hasn't come in yet.

873
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes ma'am.

874
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,600
There she is!

875
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,200
Yes?

876
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,400
Sergeant Chaney,
 Police Department.

877
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,100
Oh, what is it, Sergeant?

878
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,300
We just tagged a
 cab from downtown.

879
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,500
Driver said he
 brought the fare here.

880
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,700
I'd like to talk to her.

881
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,100
Well there must be
 a mistake, officer,

882
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,300
nobody's come here
 except Miss Lyons.

883
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,100
Red hair, 5'5" to
 5'7" in her early 20s.

884
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,500
Green dress, green shoes.

885
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,700
What do you want her for?

886
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,100
Theft, Hathaways
 Department Store.

887
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,300
Pearl necklace, sales
 girl wasn't too sure.

888
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,700
Was afraid to do anything
 till she checked her stock.

889
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,100
Told somebody to
 get the cab license.

890
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,700
Couldn't have been
Dorothy, she's not here.

891
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,500
Wonder if I could take
 a look around for Dorothy.

892
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,300
Yes, I wish you would,
 I'll show you to her room.

893
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,700
Dorothy!

894
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,900
This man is from Hathaways.

895
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,900
How do you do?

896
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,100
Those pearls are mine,
I've had them for years.

897
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Sim pearl neck, 152.50,
 tax 10%, Hathaways.

898
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,900
Had em for years, hmm?

899
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,300
Put on your green dress
and your green shoes

900
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,300
and let's go.
 - Junie, help me!

901
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,300
Let her go, I'll pay for them.

902
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,100
Please don't arrest
 her, she's sick.

903
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,500
Five minutes, I'll
 leave the door open

904
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,700
if that's all right.
 - Junie!

905
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,300
- Oh Dorothy!
- You promised.

906
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,700
You promised.

907
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,100
- Dorothy!
 - Let me go, I didn't

908
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,300
take them, let me go!

909
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,100
June, June, don't
 let em take me!

910
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,700
You promised you'd
 take care of me!

911
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,300
Can't you see
 what you're doing?

912
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,900
You said this
 wouldn't happen again.

913
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,300
- Junie help me.
 - I will, I will.

914
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,700
June, June, don't
 let them take me.

915
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,500
I promise, I
 promise I'll help you,

916
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,300
I will, I'll fix
 everything

917
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,500
Extension 449 please.

918
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
Betsy, Miss Lyons, I wanna speak

919
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,400
to Mayor Jansen immediately.

920
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,800
I'll wait then.

921
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,000
Betsy?

922
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,800
Never mind, no don't
even tell him I called.

923
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,200
- Miss Lyons, come in.
 - Yes.

924
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,800
Okay boys, break it up.

925
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,400
This way.

926
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,600
Three grand,
 add four is seven.

927
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,800
Hey Ben, here's Miss Lyons.

928
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,400
Take a breather, boys.

929
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,400
Ben, you've gotta help me.

930
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,600
Dorothy was arrested
 this afternoon.

931
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,200
- Same thing?
 - Hathaways.

932
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,600
The police came right
 to the house for her.

933
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,200
Tell me about it.

934
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,000
She took a pearl necklace.

935
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,600
A Sergeant Chaney came
to the house about five

936
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,200
and took her to Lincoln Heights.

937
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,800
Hello, Dave Dietz still there?

938
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,600
Ben Grace.

939
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,600
Dave, there's a girl
 in Lincoln Heights,

940
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,400
Dorothy Lyons, L-Y-O-N-S.

941
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,200
Theft or grand larceny,
 I want you to get her out

942
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,200
and I want you to
 make it look like

943
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,600
she was never booked.

944
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,400
I can't do that,
 Ben, I'll have

945
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,000
the board down on my neck.

946
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,600
I don't care how you
 do it, it has to be done.

947
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,200
This comes straight from Jansen.

948
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,200
All right, call me back.

949
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,400
- I can't believe it.
 - Believe what?

950
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,000
You, lying to Dietz.

951
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,800
Everything Ben, this
 house, and what's

952
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,400
going on in it.
 - It's Sol Casper's house.

953
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,600
He's holed up in Mexico.

954
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,200
Then it's true,
 all the terrible

955
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,600
things I've heard
 about you lately.

956
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,800
I didn't wanna believe that.

957
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,600
It's the same old
 operation, isn't it?

958
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,000
And you talked me into
 suggesting Dave Dietz

959
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,600
for Chief of Police, and you go

960
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,400
right on your merry way,
well Sol Caspar's out,

961
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,200
but it's the same system.

962
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,800
As long as people
 gamble, there's

963
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,200
gonna be a system,
 if I don't operate it

964
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,400
someone else will.
 - If I had any sense,

965
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,800
any courage, I'd go
straight to Frank Jansen

966
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,200
and tell him.
 - You think that would

967
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,200
stop it, oh a
 little while maybe,

968
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,400
but before me there was Caspar

969
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,600
and there'll be
 someone else after me.

970
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Grow up, the money
 is here, I'm gonna

971
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,800
get mine.

972
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,000
Hello.
 - What about the file

973
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
on the girl.
- Yeah, Dave, we'll talk

974
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,000
about that tomorrow,
 right now, I'm interested

975
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,400
in getting that girl
 here as soon as possible.

976
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,800
All right, goodnight, thanks.

977
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,800
She'll be here within the hour.

978
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Good service.

979
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,000
You gonna tell Jansen?

980
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,000
You know I won't.

981
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
For two reasons.

982
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
I know you won't
 because of Dorothy

983
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,200
what's the other reason?

984
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,000
You know that too.

985
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,400
Told you it was all a mistake.

986
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Why would I want to steal

987
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,600
a little thing like that?

988
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,600
Junie!
 - Darling, it's all right.

989
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Ben Grace managed
 to get you out.

990
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,400
Oh Ben, thanks, oh
 you saved my life.

991
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,000
It was horrible, horrible.

992
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,600
Forget it, it never happened.

993
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,400
I think we could
all use a drink.

994
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,000
Oh, you bet I could,
 three feet high.

995
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,600
Nice layout you got here.

996
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,800
I can stay for a while?

997
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,200
Might not be a
 bad idea, be safer.

998
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
She needs guilt,
 care and rest.

999
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,600
Oh Ben must have
 a housekeeper.

1000
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,400
I can get lots of
 rest right here.

1001
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Darling, you'll be
much better off at home.

1002
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,400
Now, drink your drink, then
 we'll all go back, huh?

1003
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,800
All right, if you say so.

1004
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,600
I'll have plenty of
time to see Ben's house.

1005
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,400
But Dietz you
 assured me you were

1006
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,800
after the same
 thing I was, clean,

1007
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,800
honest government,
 what good does it do

1008
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,600
to get rid of a Solly
Caspar if you're taking

1009
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,000
orders from another hoodlum?

1010
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,200
Mr. Mayor, nobody
 should have even

1011
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,800
heard about it, I still.
- That's not the point,

1012
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,400
I did hear about it.

1013
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,800
I want a complete
 report by tomorrow

1014
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,200
even if it means
 I go out of office

1015
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,000
and you go back to
 pounding a beat.

1016
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,800
Yes sir, after all, Mr. Mayor,

1017
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,800
it was Ben Grace who told me to.

1018
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
What's that got to do with it?

1019
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
I mean I figured
 that after all,

1020
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,600
you and him.
 - That's all, Dietz.

1021
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,800
Yes sir.

1022
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,000
June, will you come in please?

1023
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yes sir.

1024
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,800
Yes, Frank?

1025
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,600
I'm going to be
 pretty blunt, June.

1026
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,000
I know all about
 Dorothy's arrest,

1027
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
especially how she was let go.

1028
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,200
She should never
 have been arrested.

1029
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,200
She's not a criminal, she
 needs psychiatric care.

1030
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,000
But she was
arrested, and she's got

1031
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,800
to face the charges,
the Governor's given me

1032
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,800
till five tomorrow afternoon
 to have her arraigned.

1033
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,800
We'll let normal
 procedure follow.

1034
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,800
The Governor.

1035
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,800
The Governor, who
could have me impeached.

1036
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,800
Dorothy was on probation.

1037
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,200
But you don't
 have any idea what

1038
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,400
it would do to her to
 have to go back to prison!

1039
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,200
Do you know what Dr. Mapes said?

1040
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
That she's on the end
 of a real breakdown

1041
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,000
that any emotional shock.
 - I'll do everything

1042
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,400
I can to see that
 she gets to the right

1043
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,600
kind of institution,
 she's not going to be

1044
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,800
thrown into a dungeon.

1045
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
All right, Frank.

1046
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,000
What do you want me to do?

1047
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,000
I want you to bring
 her in tomorrow.

1048
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,600
I'm not going to have them
 issue a warrant for her.

1049
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,600
June.

1050
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,100
This can't change
 how I feel about you

1051
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,700
except feeling sorry, knowing
 what you have to live with.

1052
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,700
I know, you're
 very kind, Frank.

1053
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,300
I should have known
 you'd be like this.

1054
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,500
Don't you know by
 now I don't judge you?

1055
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,500
I just love you.

1056
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,300
Come on,
 we've gotta get busy.

1057
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,500
Oh, Junie, you're home early.

1058
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,900
- Yes.
 - These gonna all be

1059
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,500
all right here?
- They're lovely, honey.

1060
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,900
Hello, Martha.

1061
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,100
No one called, Miss
 Lyons, she's been

1062
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,500
fine, absolutely fine.

1063
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,900
How do you feel?

1064
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,300
Never felt better.

1065
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,500
Slept like a log.

1066
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,600
Dor, things are in a mess.

1067
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,400
I hate to have to
 tell you this but,

1068
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
you have to go back, tomorrow.

1069
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,000
To jail?

1070
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,400
Oh honey, Frank
 says it doesn't

1071
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,600
have to be prison,
 just a nice quiet

1072
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,000
rest home, some place close by.

1073
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,800
But you have to
 face the charges.

1074
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,000
Nice state institution,
 all the modern conveniences.

1075
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,200
Steel bars at every window.
 - Don't talk like that.

1076
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,400
Shock treatments in
 different buildings.

1077
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,000
- Dorothy, please.
 - I've been there,

1078
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,800
I know what it's like,
 I've been to the good ones,

1079
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,200
the crummy ones, the
ones you wear uniforms,

1080
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,000
the ones you don't,
 I'm an expert.

1081
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,800
Honey, it's for your own good.

1082
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,600
You've got to get well.

1083
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,000
Don't you see what
 happened yesterday

1084
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,800
could happen anytime and
then it will be prison?

1085
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,800
All I want for
 you is what's best

1086
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,800
All you want is
 to get rid of me.

1087
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,400
You want Ben for yourself.

1088
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,000
Let's leave Ben
 Grace out of this.

1089
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,400
Press the button
 and little Dor

1090
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,000
is shipped off to
 some nice nut house.

1091
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,400
Dor, how can you
 talk to me like that?

1092
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,800
I've tried to look
 after you ever since

1093
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,600
Dad died.
 - Oh, looked after me.

1094
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,600
I've been shoved
 off on more people

1095
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,800
than you can shake a stick at.

1096
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,200
Well I had to make
 a living, didn't I?

1097
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,000
Oh sure, you had
 to make a living.

1098
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,600
You had to get
 ahead, be promoted.

1099
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,200
One day you woke up and realized

1100
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,600
suddenly you hadn't been
 on the cover of Time yet.

1101
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,800
I gave you everything I could.

1102
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,000
Because you felt
 guilty, you had

1103
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
a bad conscience, you
 know how it started.

1104
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,400
That charm bracelet, the
one Mama gave to you.

1105
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,800
I had to have it.

1106
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,800
So I stole it.

1107
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,800
I liked taking it, I
 liked the sensation.

1108
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,600
It was fun, so it
 was you, June, yoU!

1109
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,200
And all the things you bought me

1110
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,000
they pay off a lot
 of years, don't they?

1111
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,200
A lot of years,
 what do you think

1112
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,200
I've been through
 in lot of years?

1113
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,600
Holding my breath
 every time I saw

1114
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,400
a cop pass by the
 house, trying to

1115
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,800
fix things and
 square things and pay

1116
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,200
things off, all
 because my sister

1117
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,600
didn't have any more
 morals than an alley cat.

1118
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, you're a fine one to tell me

1119
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
how I should have lived my life.

1120
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,400
If I didn't earn
 money, who'd get you

1121
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,800
out of trouble,
 and who'd pay off

1122
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,600
those lovely friends
 of yours you seem

1123
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,600
to attract the way
 garbage does flies?

1124
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,400
Oh Dor!

1125
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,000
Dor!

1126
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,600
I'm sorry.

1127
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,800
You're right, June,
 you're always right.

1128
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,200
I'll have to go back, tomorrow.

1129
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,600
All right
 Sergeant, that's all.

1130
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,600
What's the idea, Dave?

1131
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
That cop was rousting
 me like a pickpocket.

1132
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,600
I told him to bring you in.

1133
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,000
You think you've
 got more privileges

1134
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,200
than any other citizen.?

1135
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,600
All right, Chief,
 what's your problem?

1136
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,400
My problem I'll worry about.

1137
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,200
Jansen wants you in his
office this afternoon.

1138
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,200
Oh, I think you
better calm Jansen down.

1139
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,600
He's liable to get
 an earful about

1140
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,600
honest Dave Dietz.
 - You'll be there, Ben

1141
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,000
or I won't send out just a cop.

1142
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,800
I'll have squad cars
all over that beautiful

1143
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,800
driveway of yours.

1144
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,900
I seem to remember,
 Chief, that you're the one

1145
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,500
who sprung the lock on her.

1146
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,700
Good with a knife, aren't you?

1147
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,500
Use your friends till
 they start dragging

1148
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,300
then cut em right off.

1149
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,500
What are you beefin' about?

1150
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,300
Those look like fifty
 dollar shoes to me, copper.

1151
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,300
Now you listen,
 Ben, Dorothy Lyons

1152
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,700
is just another thief right now.

1153
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,100
And you're just another
guy who asked me

1154
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,700
to do something outta line.

1155
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,500
Yes, all right in a minute.

1156
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
You both better be
 in Jansen's office.

1157
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,300
On time.

1158
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,900
I kept it on hand as
you told me, Mr. Grace.

1159
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,700
30, I think.

1160
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,700
Is that all?

1161
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,300
No sir, no, there's
 an additional six

1162
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,500
that I always keep here.

1163
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,100
I'll take it.

1164
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,700
What's that?

1165
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,500
Mr. Coulter asked for it.

1166
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,700
Solly's attorney?

1167
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,100
Yes, Coulter was afraid
that Mr. Caspar's

1168
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,900
safe deposit boxes
 and everything

1169
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,300
would be subpoenad but
 the State's attorney.

1170
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,100
What's the key to?

1171
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,300
The vault at the beach house.

1172
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,700
- The vault?
 - Yes, in the basement

1173
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,900
you know behind the furnace.

1174
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,500
I'll look after that.

1175
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,900
How do I charge
 the 36,000 Mr. Grace?

1176
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,900
Charge it to the blue account.

1177
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,100
- Yes sir.
 - I'll put it back next week.

1178
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,700
Betsy, no more appointments,

1179
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,900
the mayor's gone for the day

1180
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,100
and I'm just leaving,
 cancel everything.

1181
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,900
- Everything but me.
 - Ben, Frank wanted

1182
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
to see you, but he.
 - I've got a better idea.

1183
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,100
What's that?

1184
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,100
You and me, no
 Dorothy, no Jansen

1185
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,900
no Dietz, I wanna
 pull out, with you.

1186
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,700
You know I can't
 leave Dorothy.

1187
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,900
Why not?

1188
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:35,900
What'd she ever do for you?

1189
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,500
I can't run away
 from anything.

1190
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,700
Because of him?

1191
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,300
No, not anymore.

1192
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,900
Alright then lady,
you got yourself a deal.

1193
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,700
We're two hours
 from San Francisco.

1194
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,500
After that we just
 put a pin on a map.

1195
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,100
Scare ya?

1196
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,700
Yes, it does scare me.

1197
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,100
I've got $36,000 in cash here.

1198
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,300
After I stop up the
 beach, I'll have

1199
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,900
another 160,000 more.

1200
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,500
Two weeks ago maybe,
 even two months ago maybe

1201
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,100
but not now, Ben, it's
 too late, I'm sorry.

1202
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:12,900
That's too bad, lady.

1203
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,900
We'd have made a
 great combination.

1204
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,500
Dorothy?

1205
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:35,900
I thought I heard you.

1206
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,900
Your sister hasn't
 come down yet.

1207
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,900
She hasn't?

1208
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,300
Haven't you seen her at all?

1209
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,300
No, I imagine that sedative
 you gave her, you know.

1210
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,500
I've got a lovely
 crab salad for lunch

1211
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,900
but I wondered about the melon.

1212
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,700
Dorothy!

1213
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,100
Dor!

1214
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,100
Honey!

1215
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,900
Martha!

1216
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,900
Martha!

1217
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,300
She's gone.

1218
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,500
I've got to find her!

1219
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
My name is Dorothy.

1220
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,200
Well, how do you do?

1221
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,800
I just walked in,
 where is everybody?

1222
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,000
- Are you a friend.
 - Are you a friend of Ben's?

1223
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,800
That's
 uh, not exactly

1224
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
the expression I'd use, are you?

1225
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,200
That's not the expression
 I'd use exactly, either.

1226
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,100
I wonder when
 he's gonna get here.

1227
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,700
Not that there's anything wrong

1228
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,500
with the people who
 are here already.

1229
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,700
Just that I'm anxious.

1230
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,300
Don't you know
 when he'll show up?

1231
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,400
Who knows with Ben Grace.

1232
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,000
But I bet if he
 knew I was waiting

1233
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
here for him, nice and
 quiet on his couch.

1234
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,800
He'd be here sooner than this.

1235
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,200
He thinks that
 much of you, Dorothy?

1236
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,600
He thinks that
 much of me, Dorothy.

1237
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,400
Stand up, Dorothy.

1238
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,200
No arguments.

1239
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Put on your shoes.

1240
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You wouldn't put me
 away anyplace, would you?

1241
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,200
Of course I wouldn't.

1242
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
I know Ben
 wouldn't, that's why

1243
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,400
I came to Ben's
 house, but no Ben.

1244
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,000
We'll see him, real soon.

1245
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,800
Nice material, I
 love it.

1246
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,200
- Hi Jim.
 - Hi, Ben.

1247
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,400
The old buss all gassed up?

1248
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,000
Yeah, she's set to
 go, but what do you

1249
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,800
want it for, you can tool
 around in this tiger?

1250
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,600
I'm driving to the
 coast with this bull.

1251
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,800
Turned us all to my uncle.

1252
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,600
You're the boss, but
 gee, I spent two days

1253
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,400
polishing this up, you know Ben,

1254
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,600
driving that new
 one, everyone knew

1255
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,200
it was Ben Grace, now
 you're just gonna be

1256
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,400
another schmo on the highway.

1257
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,000
I never thought of that.

1258
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,200
Say, Mr. Grace, as long
 as you're not gonna use it,

1259
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
I got a real hot date tonight.

1260
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
Sure, sure.

1261
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,400
Here, knock her dead.
 - Thanks.

1262
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,300
Doesn't anyone
answer up there?

1263
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,700
Ben'll answer,
always takes Ben

1264
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,700
a little time to get
 around to things.

1265
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,300
Just ask him now.

1266
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,700
Tell him you're
 having a little party

1267
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,800
all by yourself
 and you miss him.

1268
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
That wouldn't
 be quite the truth

1269
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,000
would it, all by
myself I mean.

1270
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,800
Ben, are you here?

1271
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,000
Ben, answer me!

1272
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,400
Dorothy!

1273
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,000
Ben!

1274
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,200
Hate to say it, I don't think

1275
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,400
he's gonna answer.

1276
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,800
Hello, hello?

1277
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,200
Oh, is that you, Mr. Grace?

1278
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,800
What's keeping you, Mr. Grace,

1279
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,000
here I am all by
 myself in Solly's

1280
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,200
nice little beach house

1281
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,800
if you'd be here, it'd be
 a lot cosier, wouldn't it?

1282
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,200
Dorothy!

1283
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,800
Dorothy!

1284
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,800
- Okay?
- Fine.

1285
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,400
I like you.

1286
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,200
How'd you know
 where to find it all?

1287
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,800
I'm an old friend of Ben's.

1288
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,200
Never saw so much
 money in all my life.

1289
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,800
You uh, you gonna give it
 all to Ben when he comes?

1290
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,800
I'll give it to him.

1291
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,400
Could I have some, just once?

1292
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,000
Sure, why not?

1293
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,800
You earned it, Dorothy.

1294
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,600
I did?

1295
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,800
If you want more, just
 ask for it, I don't mind.

1296
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,000
No fun that way.

1297
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,600
You ever been
 to Mexico, honey?

1298
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,200
- Never have.
 - Like to go with me?

1299
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,400
Maybe I'd like that very much.

1300
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,400
There's Ben!

1301
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,800
Wait a minute.

1302
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,800
You'll spoil the game.

1303
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,600
Now you sit over
 there in that chair

1304
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,200
right there, facing the door.

1305
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Come in, that's all
 you say, come in.

1306
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Come in.

1307
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,600
Come in!

1308
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,000
Dor!

1309
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Where's Ben?

1310
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,800
Are you all right?

1311
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,000
Who's this, Dorothy?

1312
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
My big sister, June.

1313
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,600
Always walks in at
 the wrong times.

1314
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
I'm taking you home.

1315
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,400
I know where
 you wanna take me.

1316
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,600
Dorothy.

1317
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,600
I'm taking you home.

1318
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,600
Leave her alone.

1319
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,000
You leave her alone, Caspar,

1320
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,400
can't you see she's sick.

1321
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,000
Sick that's a terrible way

1322
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
to talk about a cute kid.

1323
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Come here, honey.

1324
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,400
Sick?

1325
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,600
I think she's
 nothing but a laugh.

1326
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,800
He doesn't
 think I'm sick.

1327
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,600
So you're that
 smart girl Jansen

1328
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,000
always had on the side.

1329
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,400
I got a real good
 reason to kill you.

1330
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,600
I got you to thank for
 Mexico, you and Ben.

1331
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,600
Back up smart girl.

1332
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,800
Are you really
 gonna give it to her?

1333
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,000
Run, Dorothy, run!

1334
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,000
Why should I, honey bunch?

1335
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,400
Yes, why should she?

1336
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,400
The boys'll be here about
 nine, and we'll have

1337
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,400
ourselves a barrel of laughs.

1338
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,000
Then I'm taking little
 Dorothy and flying

1339
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,400
down to Mexico with
her and we'll be flying

1340
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,400
like bats upside down
 and every which way.

1341
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,200
You sit there where I can keep

1342
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,200
an eye on ya, honey.

1343
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,000
Hey, maybe we'll have
 ourselves a ball right here.

1344
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,200
Keep walking backwards,
slow, so you don't

1345
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,600
stumble over anything.

1346
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,000
Feel the door, you feel
the handle behind you.

1347
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,900
Dorothy, no!

1348
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,100
Back out on the terrace.

1349
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,700
Too bad you won't be
 around for the rest

1350
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,500
of the floor show, smart girl.

1351
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,300
Pretty soon, the tide'll
be taking you bye bye.

1352
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,400
Dorothy!

1353
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,400
Listen to me, it's June.

1354
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,400
Ben, help me with her.

1355
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Let's put her on the couch.

1356
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,600
Knew she was crazy
 but I didn't think

1357
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,600
she was crazy to kill anybody.

1358
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,400
I did it, I shot him.

1359
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,400
You?

1360
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,200
Well come on, let's
 get out of here.

1361
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,800
Come on, help me
 grab some of this.

1362
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,000
I'm not going with you.

1363
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,000
What do you mean
 you're not going?

1364
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,600
You're mixed up in a killing!

1365
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,400
What kind of a witness
 do you think she'll make?

1366
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
You weren't any
 part of this, go on

1367
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:55,800
take your money, you've got
 everything you ever wanted.

1368
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,600
You're quite a
girl, aren't ya?

1369
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,800
Ben, you've been hit.

1370
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,600
Yeah.

1371
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,400
Solly's men'll
be here at nine.

1372
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,800
You better get out of
 here while you can.

1373
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:51,200
How far do you think I'd
 get with this bullet in me?

1374
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
Five, four, three.

1375
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,800
What are you doing?

1376
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,800
Three, let me
 speak to Chief Dietz.

1377
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,400
Dave, this is Ben, oh shut up.

1378
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,000
Look I want you to
 get up to Solly's

1379
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,800
beach house at
 nine o'clock sharp.

1380
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,600
Bring a full squad and
 bring an ambulance.

1381
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,000
Dave, be on time,
 nine o'clock sharp!

1382
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,200
Lenny, Bruce, Grannar!

1383
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,400
Get me in the house,
 the rest of you guys

1384
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,800
go round the terrace, I got
 Ben Grace holed up in there.

1385
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,000
Let's get her upstairs.

1386
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,800
- Junie?
- Yes, honey, I'm here.

1387
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,600
- Take care of me.
- I'll take care of you

1388
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,200
darling, you're
 going to have help

1389
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,700
lots of help, don't
 worry, you're going

1390
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,500
to be all right.
- Yes, but.

1391
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,500
June, you come with me.

1392
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,700
I'll be with you, darling.

1393
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,300
Go to sleep, rest.

1394
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,700
Up there!

1395
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,700
- Oh, Junie.
 - Yes, darling, I'm here.

1396
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
Turn that chair around.

1397
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,900
Ben!

1398
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,100
It's all over.

1399
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,900
We're all here.

1400
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,700
We got you, Ben!

1401
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:11,100
You gonna come out, or
 you want us to blast?

1402
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,300
Solly says if you
 come out first,

1403
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,900
nothing will happen
 to the girls.

1404
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
- You got a deal!
 - Ben!

1405
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,900
Hi Solly.

1406
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,300
Come on down.

1407
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,700
What's the matter,
 this type of work

1408
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:50,500
outta your line?

1409
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,700
Gotta bring Lenny and
 all the boys, big man.

1410
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,300
That the kind of
 odds a big man needs?

1411
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:03,300
Got me zeroed
 in and you still

1412
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,500
can't do it yourself.

1413
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:06,700
Big man.

1414
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,700
Shut up, bright boy.

1415
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,700
No dirty hands, no guts.

1416
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,100
No guts, oh I forgot, you work

1417
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,100
on the brain level
 now, too important

1418
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:23,900
to the organization, Solly
 Caspar, gutless wonder.

1419
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,900
All right, you
 asked for it, genius.

1420
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,500
You asked for it once too often.

1421
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,700
Little by little I'm
gonna cut you to pieces.

1422
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,300
The old man can still
 handle it, can't he?

1423
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,900
How's about the other side?

1424
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,100
Still got your legs, genius.

1425
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,500
- Make a move and you get it!
 - Hold up, Lieutenant!

1426
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,900
- Ben!
 - Get em outta here!

1427
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,500
Ben, Ben, darling.

1428
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,700
June!

1429
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,100
June?

1430
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:24,900
June?

1431
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:31,300
Hang on,
 Ben for me, hang on.

1432
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:38,900
Can't, can't say I'm worth it.

1433
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,900
Ssh, don't talk, darling.

1434
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:41,900
Don't talk.

1435
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,500
Get a stretcher.

1436
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,900
Let me decide if
you're worth it or not.

1437
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,300
June, June?

1438
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,300
Junie?
