00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,940
Celebrating 15 years of GINTAMA anime

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,980
Presented by GINTAMA
Theatrical Production Committee

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,740
The land of the samurai.

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,900
There was a time, long ago,
when our country was called by that name.

5
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,610
Those dream-filled blue skies upon
which the samurai once gazed

6
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,200
are now filled with ships
from strange worlds.

7
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,900
The streets where the samurai
once proudly walked

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,820
are now filled with swaggering,
arrogant aliens.

9
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,490
Hey, dammit!

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,110
But a select few rose up
to face this crisis,

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,490
one unprecedented in the Edo of old...

12
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,110
They were the samurai.

13
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,780
No...

14
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,200
They were the Z Warriors!

15
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,940
Part 1: The Super Long Story

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,990
- Part 1: The Super Long Story!

17
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,900
So, planets out there in the universe
have a thing called Altana,

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,990
a sort of energy that's like
that world's life force.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,990
On Earth, it's also known as ley lines.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,150
That energy led to the birth
of the immortal fiend known as Utsuro.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,280
As a result of living life after life,
an existence of never-ending suffering,

22
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,400
Utsuro developed multiple
separate personalities.

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,150
One of these was teacher
of Gintoki and the others

24
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,110
and founder of the Shoka Sonjuku school,

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,150
Shoyo Yoshida.

26
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,280
With the goal of destroying
the entire planet, himself included,

27
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,110
Utsuro waged war
against the known universe.

28
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,070
The people of Edo
resisted with all their might,

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,320
and at the end of a fierce battle,

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,900
the Odd Jobs and their allies
showed real strength

31
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,570
and forced Utsuro to fall
into the ley lines.

32
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,070
It was then that, having used up all
his energy to contain the ley lines,

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,900
the dog deity called Sadaharu
entered a long coma.

34
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,650
Later, the members of the Odd Jobs

35
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,320
found their respective goals
and set off on their own paths.

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,300
Two Years Later

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,740
And so, two years passed...

38
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,650
I'm gonna do it!

39
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,530
I will become the Pirate King!

40
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,820
Huh? No, wait.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Not that "two years later."

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,990
We've done so many
two- and five-year timeskips,

43
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,610
it's hard to keep the story
straight at this point.

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,650
Ah, here! This is it!

45
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,860
Let's see...

46
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,200
Kagura looked to find a way
to return Sadaharu to normal,

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,450
while Shinpachi remained in Edo.

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,400
Meanwhile, Gintoki,
having foreseen Utsuro's return,

49
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,650
made the rounds of the gates,
the openings in various, scattered areas

50
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,700
from which the ley lines' power erupts.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,360
Utsuro's genes continued to survive
deep underground within the ley lines.

52
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,070
Over two years,
they rebuilt his physical form,

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,450
and he was reborn at a remote ley line.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,030
Gintoki wandered the lands with Utsuro,
who grew rapidly, in tow.

55
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,110
One day, it became clear that the body

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,490
housed a personality
that could be Shoyo.

57
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,530
However, Utsuro was captured
by the Death Star Sect,

58
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
led by the remnants of the Tendoshuu.

59
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,200
To prevent them from gaining
a perfect immortal,

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
he left his heart alone with Gintoki.

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,320
In order to complete Utsuro's recovery,

62
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,610
and by extension their own immortality,

63
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,490
the Sect sets its sights on Earth's Altana.

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
At the ruins of the Shoka Sonjuku,
Gintoki is reunited with Takasugi,

65
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,780
who has used the bones
of senior student Oboro

66
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,700
to become partially immortal.

67
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,240
In order to thwart the Sect's plans,

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,740
Gintoki and Takasugi head for Edo.

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,900
Upon returning to Edo,

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,490
Gintoki spots the older
Shinpachi and Kagura

71
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,280
but doesn't make contact.

72
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,240
Meanwhile, Katsura, the first Prime Minister,

73
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,070
uses his office to investigate
the Sect's actions.

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,110
In order to draw out the Sect,

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,570
Takasugi blows up the Terminal
and attempts to assassinate Katsura.

76
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,900
Katsura uses the assassination as cover

77
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,450
to relinquish his
position as Prime Minister.

78
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,820
The pupils of the Shoka Sonjuku school
once again come together.

79
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,700
Even the Shinsengumi,

80
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,860
who were pretending to
have disbanded, regroup.

81
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,990
Meanwhile, the gorilla was holding
a wedding ceremony.

82
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,400
After much ado, the ship carrying Kondo

83
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,150
attacks the Sect's Mobile Cathedral Kuyo,

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,990
causing the wreckage
to fall atop the Terminal.

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,450
Kondo reunites with the Shinsengumi.

86
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,780
However, the Sect occupies the Terminal,

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,490
and the city is plunged into danger.

88
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Edo is once again faced with harm.

89
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,150
This is when Shinpachi, Kagura,

90
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,280
and the residents of Kabuki District
gather in front of Odd Jobs

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
and set off to battle.

92
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,740
To fulfill the wishes of,
and save, their teacher,

93
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,320
Gintoki, Takasugi, and Katsura
decide to rescue Utsuro.

94
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,740
The Terminal would be the battlefield.

95
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,990
Will the Z Warriors be able
to reclaim the future?

96
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,450
Nobody could pay attention
to the recap with those visuals!

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,520
Wolf Fang Fist

98
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,570
- Wolf Fang Fist!

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,200
Not only was it way too long,

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
the art style made it look like
it was for a completely different show!

101
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,900
It looked like some
fan-made Dragon Ball anime!

102
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,280
Dragen Bell?
What are you talking about, Katsurass?

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,780
I'm not Katsurass! I'm Katsura!

104
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,360
So the anime staff have finally
gotten serious, huh?

105
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,240
Free from the shackles of TV production,

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,450
they've finally started putting
some effort into the animation.

107
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,700
This is what the animation staff
are truly capable of.

108
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,990
They're just drawing while holding
Dragon Balls in their left hands!

109
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
And why do I have to be Yamcha
while this fool is Vegeta?!

110
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,030
That makes me look like a total loser!

111
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,780
So stupid! I'm not playing
along with your nonsense.

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,200
It pains me to say it,
but you're virtually identical.

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,900
And when did you become a master
at growing a widow's peak?

114
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,240
You guys just don't get it, do you?

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,900
We've gone beyond
the final TV episode,

116
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,320
beyond the manga's ending scams,

117
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,610
and finally reached this point...

118
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,820
this new world: the movie theater!

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,400
And it's up to us to show
those in attendance here today...

120
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,200
our power, and the power
of Akira Toriyama!

121
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,400
Shoyo, looks like things
worked out somehow, huh?

122
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,030
Yes! No matter what anyone says,

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,570
things did work out somehow!

124
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,570
Got that right!

125
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,360
And this marks the end
of the cinematic exploits

126
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,780
of Gintoki and his companions.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,740
Their path ahead is sure to be
rife with trials and tribulations,

128
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,490
but they will no doubt
be able to overcome them.

129
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,570
They will be fine,
for they have the Silver Balls.

130
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
What the hell are Silver Balls?

131
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,200
Galick Gun!

132
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,570
Kakarot!

133
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,150
Are they balls that can grant wishes?

134
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,070
Or are they the same as
the pea you call a brain?

135
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,780
If balls that convenient really existed,

136
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,780
none of us would be here
in this position right now.

137
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,900
And yet, I'd like to be grateful.

138
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,450
We managed to get this far
on our own two feet.

139
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,610
With our own power,

140
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,780
with these very hands of ours...

141
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,990
we will take back everything...

142
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,990
we lost.

143
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,200
That's how we, the students of Shoyo,
do things, right?

144
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,190
GINTAMA

145
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,800
Part 2: Fate

146
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,570
Fire!

147
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,070
Eliminate them!

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,280
Bring the hammer down upon those heretics

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,610
who would interfere
with our divine summon...

150
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,030
Divine summoning?

151
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,110
That's rich, coming from a bunch of fools
looking for immortality on the cheap!

152
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,530
Look.
Their ship is down,

153
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,650
but it's still drawing
Altana from the Earth

154
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,400
through the Terminal's core.

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,530
The Seireimon Gate is still operating?

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,820
And with that Altana,

157
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,530
even an incomplete god without a heart

158
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,070
can be brought back to life?

159
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm more surprised
that so many people

160
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,900
want to live forever
in this awful world.

161
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,570
My life has put me through
more than enough joys and sorrows.

162
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,400
If I can overcome that last,
final trial with you all...

163
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,780
I won't mind if my life
is to end right here!

164
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,030
Would our meeting be one of the joys?

165
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,360
Or is it one of the sorrows?

166
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
There's no telling at this point,

167
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,530
but there is one thing that's for sure...

168
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,860
We hated and tried to kill each other,

169
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
but still our ties couldn't be broken.

170
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,900
I'm sick of you idiots,

171
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,650
and I'm sick of being
given the runaround by you fools.

172
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,320
I sure hope this life is
the last one you ruin for me!

173
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,900
That so?

174
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,900
Too bad for you, though.

175
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,400
You guys can't die just yet.

176
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,150
I won't let you.

177
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
I get how they feel.

178
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,070
I don't want to die.
I want to keep on living.

179
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,780
Because there's this fool of a teacher
who's put me through so much,

180
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,740
and this other idiot who just threw me
like a sack of potatoes,

181
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,860
and I'm not done beating them up.

182
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,650
I have some things
I'd like to say to Sensei as well.

183
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,740
Same here. A great many things.

184
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,400
How long will you have to
beat him up to feel better?

185
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,280
An eternity wouldn't be long enough!

186
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,280
Zura!

187
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,530
To the people occupying the Terminal

188
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,110
you are completely surrounded.

189
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,570
Resistance is futile.

190
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,740
Give yourselves up now!

191
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,990
If you don't...

192
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,900
Shoot them down!

193
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,570
If you don't,

194
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,360
let me express my gratitude.

195
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,820
Thanks to you all,

196
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,200
our country has become this strong!

197
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Go!

198
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,570
Those guys...

199
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,240
Let's go!

200
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,360
Decades have passed
since you Amanto came to Earth.

201
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,150
We have lived

202
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,990
lives full of doubt and agony!

203
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,820
But now we can say this...

204
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,820
those days have not been in vain!

205
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,820
Amidst all that we've lost,

206
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,070
we have found that which is important

207
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,070
that which we must protect!

208
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,200
Our shadows on the ground

209
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,240
have showed us the way to the light!

210
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,740
So we won't fear you anymore.

211
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,530
We'll meet you head on,
fair and square!

212
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,780
- Welcome to the land of the samurai.
- Welcome to the land of the samurai.

213
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,860
A land whose people possess
minds of steel...

214
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,650
A land whose people
possess souls of silver.

215
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,990
- We're glad to have you!
- We're glad to have you!

216
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,650
Gintoki!

217
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,360
Gintoki!

218
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,360
Pops! We could use some help!

219
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,450
Split up the enemy's defenses
around the Terminal!

220
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,990
Screw that tedious crap.

221
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
We'll just attack the mothership on top!

222
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,780
Right now, that ship

223
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
contains all the Altana
it's taken in from the Terminal!

224
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,650
If you attack it now,
there's no telling what will happen.

225
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,740
Just leave it to us!

226
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,650
Yo. You took your time.

227
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,070
You took so long,

228
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,030
I thought you guys had
turned tail and run for it.

229
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,780
Can't have a party without
the guests of honor,

230
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
- know what I'm saying?
- Well, well...

231
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,820
So you finally admit that
the Odd Jobs are better than you, huh?

232
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,200
The hell are you talking about?

233
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,490
I'm just saying,
if we're gonna raise hell,

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,990
it'd be more fun to do it

235
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,650
with the most nasty devils around.

236
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,570
I guess that means we're out, then.

237
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,320
Let's go...

238
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,740
To see our guests of honor,

239
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,570
and raise hell one last time!

240
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,200
This is shaping up to be
a long, dragged-out battle.

241
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,280
We should fall back and regroup.

242
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,530
Even if we do succeed in reviving Utsuro,

243
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,570
it would be for naught
if we lost the Sect in the process.

244
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,490
We'd lose the ability to produce the elixir
and our chance to return to power.

245
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,030
No need to worry.

246
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,110
Everything is going as planned.

247
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,070
It really does seem as though Utsuro

248
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,110
can only be fueled
by the Altana on Earth.

249
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,070
Look! Our god is truly pleased!

250
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,110
Is the Altana he's absorbing...

251
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,530
...reconstructing his heart?

252
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,780
The time is nigh.
Very soon,

253
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,150
our god will awaken.

254
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,110
Isn't that enough?

255
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,450
Prolonging this any further
will make it harder for us to leave.

256
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Prepare to withdraw!

257
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,650
You cannot control
your bodies, is it?

258
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,360
It happened to me too.

259
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,490
We Tendoshu self-destructed
by stealing Utsuro's blood,

260
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,110
but that very same blood
brought us back.

261
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,030
We were being kept alive,
being used,

262
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,820
and being controlled

263
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,900
by Utsuro's genes
from the moment we took them in.

264
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,900
We have always been a
part of Utsuro.

265
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,530
And now it falls upon us
to execute his will.

266
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,740
Hand over the heart.

267
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,400
It doesn't belong in your hands.

268
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,450
They are meant to hold better things.

269
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,780
Since we had the same teacher,

270
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,360
you and I were fated to cross swords.

271
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,780
If I could do it all over again...

272
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,320
I...

273
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
I would've loved to be
one of you guys...

274
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,610
I have my own,

275
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,900
and you have your own

276
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,780
things to take back, right?

277
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,490
Takasugi,

278
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,280
I...

279
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,030
Let's get a move on.

280
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,240
- Takasugi.
- What?

281
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,450
There's nothing left for me
to take back.

282
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,570
Whatever I lost
has come back to me.

283
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
It's all right here.

284
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,280
And I'm here to make sure
I don't lose any of it ever again.

285
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Gintoki! Takasugi!

286
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,820
Zura!

287
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,740
Jump!

288
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,530
You're stepping on me.

289
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,070
Now we're even.

290
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,450
You're the last person
I wanna owe anything.

291
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,360
What a coincidence.
I could say the same...

292
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,570
Takasugi?

293
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,860
It's over.
You people cannot beat me.

294
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,990
Did you catch a glimpse of
the Utsuro within me?

295
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,530
Utsuro rules over and decides all.

296
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,650
His designs are inescapable...

297
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,700
Just like fate.

298
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,240
That so?

299
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,030
Is this what you're telling me, then?

300
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,320
That I'm only standing here, undying,

301
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
because Utsuro led me here?

302
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,070
Wrong.

303
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,450
I...

304
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,320
We weren't led here by anyone.

305
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,860
We stand before you
of our own free will.

306
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,030
Go!

307
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm taking this back.

308
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,820
You are... Hitsugi, was it?

309
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,570
One of the Three Crows
in Tenshoin Naraku.

310
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,700
Why would you go so far?

311
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,780
Why do you want the heart of
your former chief, Utsuro, so badly?

312
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,150
Hand over the heart.

313
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,320
Kagura!

314
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
Kagura!

315
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm fine! Go on ahead!

316
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,360
Hand over... the heart!

317
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,320
Why?

318
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,490
Naraku has already fallen apart
as an organization!

319
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,700
And yet you still want
to bring Utsuro back,

320
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,360
even if you have to reduce
Edo to rabble?

321
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,990
The only one...

322
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,530
The only one who can save him...

323
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,030
is me!

324
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,530
You...

325
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,570
Don't tell me...

326
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,110
Make use of me.

327
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,990
You...

328
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,700
It's futile.

329
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,450
You can't take us down
with your inferior blood.

330
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,700
Die.

331
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,530
Then let's go ahead and see
whose blood, mine or yours,

332
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,990
will dry up first.

333
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,110
This will go right down to the wire.

334
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,490
Do it.

335
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,070
What's going on?

336
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Gintoki...

337
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,530
How foolish!

338
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,570
Unable to watch
your friend sacrifice himself,

339
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,530
you lost a golden opportunity
to take me down.

340
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,860
That sort of miracle won't
ever happen for you again!

341
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,360
Gin!

342
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,490
Hey.

343
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,360
No need to scream.
I can hear you just fine.

344
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,570
Curse you!

345
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,530
Sadaharu?

346
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
Sadaharu!

347
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,280
Sadaharu!

348
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,650
Sadaharu...

349
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,490
You've been waiting to meet Gin
just like us, haven't you?

350
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,110
Sadaharu...

351
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,990
Sadaharu!

352
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,530
S... Sadaharu.

353
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,900
You've finally come back to us.

354
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,860
To help us...

355
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,450
To help Gin.

356
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,990
- Sadaharu!
- Something came out!

357
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,320
Hold it! Sadaharu's back,

358
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,280
but did he just... eat Gin?

359
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,990
Did he swallow him whole?

360
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,320
It's understandable.

361
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,450
Sadaharu just recovered.
He needs nutrition.

362
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,490
He didn't come to help, then.
He just showed up 'cause he was hungry!

363
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,900
Don't worry. Gin's a piece of trash.

364
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,610
Can't be digested.
He'll show up soon enough.

365
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,030
Gin!

366
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,320
What kind of hell reunion is this?

367
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,650
Gin... Gin!

368
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,280
What do you want?

369
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,030
Sorry. Got the wrong guy.

370
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,530
Some complete random
just came out of there!

371
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,200
And went right back!

372
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,700
A parasite, maybe.
He's always eaten stuff off the ground.

373
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,570
What kind of parasite
looks like it needs to pay rent?

374
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,820
That was a great bath.

375
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,900
They're coming out one after another!

376
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,530
What's this, a bathhouse?
Is there an entire world in there?

377
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,860
Excuse me! Did you happen to see
a silver-haired man inside?

378
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,740
Silver-haired?

379
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,740
Oh, you mean the newbie?

380
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,530
That kid took a different exit,
saying he didn't wanna be covered in filth.

381
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
He was covered in filth anyway!

382
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,780
Gin...

383
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,820
Remember what I said?

384
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,900
If you ever found something you really
needed to do, I'd close up shop?

385
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,400
Does the fact that you're here...

386
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,610
mean that you've gone back
to having nothing?

387
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,570
No.

388
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,570
We're here for something
we need to do.

389
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,900
Gin, we weren't Odd Jobs
because we had nothing to do.

390
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
We were just fine with anything.

391
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,900
We were fine with anything...

392
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,280
As long as we could be here

393
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
with you and everyone else.

394
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,400
That's why we will...

395
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,700
always be Odd Jobs!

396
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,530
Sheesh.

397
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,780
You've gone and grown so much
in the time I was gone.

398
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,820
My back hurts.

399
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,240
Mind giving me a hand?

400
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,570
Come on, you sound pathetic.

401
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,780
And you call yourself Odd Jobs?

402
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
Surely your list of services
includes compassion?

403
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,320
Give me an employee's discount.

404
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,150
Apparently, it's not that we've grown.

405
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,150
Gin's just regressed.

406
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,570
Completely

407
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
No, did you shrink for real?

408
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,200
Hey, you better knock it off.

409
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,030
Or my long, Shun Oguri legs
will kick your ass.

410
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,900
More like Short Oguri!

411
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,740
What's going on? What happened to you?

412
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,150
Huh? Did I get a little
digested in Sadaharu?

413
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,400
Digested?

414
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,070
Did you see anything else come out before me?

415
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
A couple of geezers out of the bath!

416
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,450
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

417
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,700
Gintoki Sepia! Gintoki Shepia!

418
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,150
Sepia? Shepia?

419
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,570
You can't just split off from me.

420
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,030
Only when together are we...

421
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,400
- Ginto3.
- Wait, your name's Ginto3?

422
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,030
Get back in here!
Gimme back my long legs!

423
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,610
No way! I'm never going back
to being that awful leg!

424
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,820
I've always wanted to complain about
you sticking your bare feet in boots!

425
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,280
What's wrong with him?

426
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,240
Why's he adding to his character
profile in the final movie?

427
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,530
That's bad!

428
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Hurry up, Gin!

429
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,240
We're right back to square one!

430
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,320
Pachi-boy, we have no choice.

431
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,070
We need to get Gintoki Sakata
reconstructed inside of Sadaharu!

432
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,740
What the heck?

433
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,240
Oh, jeez!

434
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,700
Whatever happens, happens!

435
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,990
- Come back to us,
- Come back to us,

436
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,570
- Gintoki Sakata!
- Gintoki Sakata!

437
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,860
That man...

438
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,240
had eyes too fierce to be a samurai,

439
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,820
but too focused to be a thug.

440
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,820
Just like always.

441
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,400
Are you...

442
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,300
Lake
Toya

443
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Dammit!

444
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,280
I got all the way up there,

445
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
and I have to do it all over again?

446
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,570
You seem to be in a hurry.

447
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,150
I can give you a ride
to the final boss for cheap.

448
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,320
H-Hero MADAO?

449
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,740
I quit being the hero.
I'm starting over from scratch again.

450
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,570
H-Hurry up and get in,
you stupid Earthlings!

451
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,110
Hey! Let me in!

452
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,110
-Hey!
-Stay away!

453
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Let me in if you're in there!

454
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,860
You people couldn't have done it.

455
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,570
You finally met your teacher again...

456
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,650
How could you have put
an end to him?

457
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,030
You were trying to prevent
Utsuro's return?

458
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,360
Finally...

459
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,280
At long last, he can rest.

460
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,400
Now that I have this body,
which refuses to die even when rotten,

461
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,650
I finally understood the pain...

462
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,530
of being eternal...

463
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,280
I caught just a glimpse
of his deep solitude.

464
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,820
I pray that at least in the end,

465
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,490
he can go out humanely.

466
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,900
Ow...

467
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,900
Go, quickly!

468
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,610
Gin!

469
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,400
Who brought me back?

470
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,820
Was it you?

471
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,070
Utsuro...

472
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,740
I have inherited your blood.

473
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,360
Wh-What is your desire?

474
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,320
Revenge on mankind?
The destruction of the universe?

475
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,570
Whatever it is,
I shall follow you and...

476
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,570
There is only one thing I desire.

477
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,570
But it seems I have a job to do first.

478
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,700
Sensei?

479
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,400
You're Sensei... right?

480
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,740
Please don't look so sad.

481
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,240
I...

482
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,110
We will protect you
from anything and anyone.

483
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,360
So please...

484
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Come back...

485
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:26,780
with us... to the Shoka Sonjuku School.

486
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,150
I have so much...

487
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,030
so much to tell you.

488
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,820
And it's my job... to attend to you...

489
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,490
Sen... sei...

490
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
I...

491
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,900
I'm not the kind of person
you should call Sensei anymore.

492
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,900
I can no longer go back
to being Shoyo Yoshida.

493
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,900
Forgive me.

494
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,530
You were the ones
I truly wished to protect,

495
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,820
but I couldn't help a single one of you.

496
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,990
Forgive me.

497
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,070
There's no need to apologize.

498
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,490
Shoyo...

499
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,860
I knew all along that
you couldn't protect a thing.

500
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,320
How I waited for this moment.

501
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,320
Just like you waited
for that one back then,

502
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,740
I waited for the moment

503
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,490
you would let your guard down,

504
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,900
hiding inside...

505
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,780
this dear pupil of yours.

506
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,650
Shinpachi! Kagura!

507
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Damn it all!

508
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,530
Two years ago,

509
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,860
as you rejected me and the end,
I believe I gave you some advice.

510
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,570
So long as you live,
the tragedies will continue to occur.

511
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,530
I can hear his voice extremely clearly.

512
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,200
It says he wants to put an end...

513
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,320
to anything and everything.

514
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,360
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

515
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,200
Let's end this...

516
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,490
using our swords.

517
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,820
You still draw that twig?

518
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,280
Utsuro.

519
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,860
We may have to put a bunch
of these twigs together to do it,

520
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,780
but we'll take back
what we lost that day.

521
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,360
That's a promise.

522
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,030
It will happen.

523
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,740
Your little promise
has long been broken.

524
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:54,200
By the very man you call your friend.

525
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,650
Utsuro,

526
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,070
no matter what tragedies
may befall that guy,

527
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,240
he's not the type to say
he wants to end things.

528
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,530
You know what he's more likely
to say at times like these?

529
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,360
I'll simply destroy...

530
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,700
this rotten world you
still walk freely upon.

531
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,570
Utsuro...

532
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,650
You're not the only one in here.

533
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,490
Where is Shoyo?

534
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,110
Where is his corpse?

535
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,820
A corpse?

536
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,700
There was never one
here to begin with.

537
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,650
The one lying flat on the ground

538
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,490
was you, Utsuro.

539
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,280
Sensei...

540
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,240
Problem student that I was,

541
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,650
it seems I had some homework
left to do.

542
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
Go.

543
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,240
Don't worry.

544
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,400
You have many more students

545
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,450
than just us.

546
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,570
I'll leave you to them.

547
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,150
You aren't some immortal
monster anymore.

548
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,110
The moment you entered his body,
you were done for.

549
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,650
I'll put an end to you
just like you wish, Utsuro.

550
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,030
And end this ridiculous sob story
while I'm at it!

551
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,780
But can you kill me?

552
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,490
You wanted to save him, didn't you?

553
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
You wanted to protect him, didn't you?

554
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,700
I learned that all too well
on our travels here.

555
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,240
If you kill your master for your friends,

556
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,570
and then kill your friend
for your master...

557
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
What will that leave you with?

558
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,530
Nothing.

559
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,700
You'll be nothing but a hollow void.

560
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,240
Do you have what it takes
to live through that void?

561
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,900
I...

562
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,570
I will never be empty inside.

563
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,200
What I wanted to protect

564
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,700
is right here with me.

565
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,320
Humans are hollow beings.

566
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,070
But because they know that,
they take root in the hearts of others,

567
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,530
never fading, even after death,

568
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:10,740
and continue to live forever, is it?

569
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:42,490
The score is now 246-247.

570
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,570
How the mighty have fallen.

571
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,360
This was our last duel,

572
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,400
but I let someone else
fight in my stead and lost.

573
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,900
It was your sword
that took him down.

574
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:04,400
And the one who protected Shoyo
and me was you.

575
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,860
Nothing could feel worse than a victory
given to me out of pity.

576
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,700
I couldn't make you
cut Sensei down again.

577
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,320
Compared to him,

578
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,360
I was a much
easier target, wasn't I?

579
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,990
Yeah.

580
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,360
Ain't any other stupid mugs I've come
to love punching in as much as yours.

581
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:36,150
It was the same when we were kids.

582
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,650
We fought every time we met.

583
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,900
I figured growing up
some would fix that,

584
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,780
but we remained brats all the way.

585
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,240
And in your case, you didn't even grow.

586
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,650
I did.

587
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,530
Maybe this is just
how we were fated to be.

588
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,820
And that's not too bad.

589
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:04,740
But, Takasugi,

590
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,490
you know what?

591
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,530
As much as we loved
to fight each other,

592
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,740
I would've...

593
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,900
loved to drink with you just as much.

594
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,450
That's not us.

595
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,990
Instead of wasting time on drinks,

596
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,240
I would've used it to beat you
as many times as I could.

597
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,530
But I'll give it a rest now.

598
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,450
Get going.

599
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,700
You aren't empty.

600
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,650
You still have...

601
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,780
plenty left to protect
with that thing, right?

602
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,450
Takasugi...

603
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,450
Gintoki,

604
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,110
this crushed left eye of mine

605
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,200
closed forever on that day,

606
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,490
with the last thing it saw
etched into the back of its eyelid.

607
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:27,240
I've lived my life staring at your gloomy
face from back then,

608
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,900
and I'm sick of it.

609
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,740
So at least when my right eye closes,

610
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:38,070
don't go looking like
a goddamned fool.

611
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,820
The kid...

612
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,070
who stood tall before
me when we first met,

613
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,450
the man I always wanted to beat,

614
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,820
the man I spent my whole life
chasing,

615
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,320
is better than that, isn't he?

616
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,860
Wait for me in hell, Takasugi.

617
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,530
I won't let you run away.

618
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,280
I'll beat you for sure next time.

619
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,110
Bring it on...

620
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,490
Oh no!

621
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,200
That ship sucked up too much Altana!

622
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,450
Why are you helping me?

623
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,320
I am the root cause
of all this calamity.

624
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,900
If you see someone in need,

625
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,780
help them out and then scram
with all their money.

626
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,490
That's what Gintoki Sakata
has taught us over the years.

627
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,820
Besides...

628
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,860
I've always wanted to talk to the person

629
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,200
who made him who he is.

630
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,900
No, it's the other way around.

631
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,110
If I hadn't met them, I would've
remained as empty as void.

632
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,900
They made me human.

633
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:36,280
But my existence only served
to shackle them down.

634
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,650
I have no right
to call myself their teacher.

635
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,900
Even so...

636
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,820
Even if everything you said is true,

637
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,200
it's because of you that
we got to meet Gintoki Sakata.

638
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,820
I've always wanted to meet you

639
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,990
and say...

640
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,400
Thank you.

641
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,780
I'm sure Gin and the others
feel the same way.

642
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,700
Gintoki! Takasugi!

643
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:10,530
Do you hear me? Are you all right?

644
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
We've taken over Kuyo.

645
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,780
The enemy is in tatters, too.

646
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,280
But the Terminal is still
running out of control.

647
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,400
It's only a matter of time before
it collapses with this ship.

648
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,030
Get out of there at once!

649
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,450
Zura! Running away won't help!

650
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,700
If the Terminal goes down,
the Altana inside will go berserk.

651
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:34,780
If worse comes to worst,
this entire planet could blow!

652
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,280
But... is there nothing we can do?

653
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,240
Could you let me handle this?

654
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,570
Who are you?

655
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,110
I'll use the weapons
on-board this ship.

656
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:54,450
I'll fire all the Altana it has mined
back down via the Terminal,

657
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,240
using the Altana within me.

658
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,860
But even if that quells its rage,
the Terminal won't be left standing.

659
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,360
Can I ask you to handle
the evacuations,

660
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,070
my school's biggest prodigy?

661
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,860
I know you can do it.

662
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,490
You all should live on.

663
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:22,150
All hands, evacuate!

664
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,780
We're getting out of the Terminal
as quickly as we can!

665
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,900
Zura! Use our ships!

666
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,860
Well, there you have it.

667
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,320
You should hurry up
and escape too.

668
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,700
Shoyo-sensei!

669
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,700
It's so ironic.

670
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:44,650
I hated my eternal life,
but now time is not on my side.

671
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,200
But that boy granted me
what little life I have left.

672
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,450
They have paved the path
to the future...

673
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,280
You are that future,
and it falls upon me to protect you all.

674
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,360
Please last as long as you can, my life.
Every second counts.

675
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,740
Mere seconds aren't enough.

676
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,450
But if we add up all our lives,

677
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,650
we can buy you enough time
to see your stupid student's face.

678
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,740
You kids...

679
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,780
We're sorry, but we really,

680
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,070
really can't just leave like that.

681
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,900
Didn't I say that?

682
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,900
Our job isn't complete
until we scram with all your money.

683
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,650
If the future's within our reach,

684
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,240
then we'll grab it and scram.

685
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,070
That's the Odd Jobs way.

686
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,150
Let us join you, then.

687
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,070
This sect...

688
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,530
They'd been collecting
Altana from several planets

689
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,990
to mass-produce their elixirs.

690
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,490
If we fire it all in, then you'll
have time not just to see him,

691
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,110
but even smack your
stupid student on the head.

692
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,400
Fire it all in? How, exactly?

693
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,110
Just so you know,

694
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,740
I can't operate anything other
than my outdated cellphone.

695
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,450
Modern tech's too overwhelming, right?

696
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,740
Says the guy with the robot body.

697
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,900
Well, leave that to me.

698
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,570
Machines are the same as people.

699
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,900
When they don't listen to you,

700
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,490
you kick their ass!

701
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,900
Hey, you crazies!

702
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,780
All this violence
won't just get you blocked,

703
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,700
it'll make even Siri snap
and start cussing us out!

704
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,110
Oh, but all our feelings combined
are nothing to scoff at.

705
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,400
Even without a cellphone,
they're sure to get through!

706
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,780
Hey.

707
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,280
You guys...

708
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,820
Back on your feet.
Let's go!

709
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:37,700
Gintoki, keep going.

710
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,570
He... and the rest of the Odd Jobs
should be down that way.

711
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,780
If there's anything you've left undone,
take care of it at once.

712
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,360
O Mister Shoka Sonjuku's
Biggest Prodigy,

713
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,610
weren't you tasked with
getting everyone to safety?

714
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,990
Everyone has evacuated already...

715
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,780
Other than you troublemakers, that is.

716
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,070
Zura, Takasugi's...

717
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,530
Perhaps Sensei didn't know...

718
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,320
that back then,
whenever you two got up to mischief,

719
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,400
there was another troublemaker

720
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,450
cleaning up your messes.

721
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,570
Isn't that right, Gintoki?

722
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,990
If he... If you two are getting up
to one last act of mischief,

723
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:32,570
then I can't leave this place
until I've cleaned up your mess.

724
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,400
Zura...

725
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,700
Live or die, we're in this together, eh?

726
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,860
Then you have to make sure
you come back alive, eh, Gintoki?

727
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,280
Relax!

728
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:48,740
I'll rescue you from the depths of Hell
if I have to.

729
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,280
So...

730
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:53,530
Go raise all the hell you want...

731
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,200
- Including our fallen friend's share!
- Including our fallen friend's share!

732
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:09,490
Sogo!

733
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:46,490
- Go!
- Go!

734
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:07,490
Shoyo, I've always wanted
to show you this.

735
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,240
A lot's happened
since back then, and now...

736
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,450
I run an Odd Jobs business
with these guys.

737
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,030
Yes, I got a good look,

738
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,990
Odd Jobs Gintoki Sakata...

739
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,650
You've grown into a fine man.

740
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,570
Gintoki.

741
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,280
The people here must be to you
what you were to me.

742
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:29,030
Just as the eternal monster
from that day

743
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,530
became human by meeting
you... meeting you kids,

744
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,820
the little monster with
the sad eyes from that day

745
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,450
has also become human, hasn't he?

746
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Data transfer complete.

747
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,900
Good morning, Fuyo No. 0.

748
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,610
Where am I?

749
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:37,570
Master Gengai's robot warehouse.

750
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:43,030
You were damaged in the war
and fell into a lengthy sleep.

751
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,530
I'm your clone,

752
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,990
and during that time,
I collected all the data for you.

753
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,360
My name is Tamako.

754
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,280
I'm very sorry...

755
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,700
It seems my circuitry
is still a bit awry.

756
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:01,900
How long did I spend asleep?

757
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:03,060
Part 3:

758
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:07,270
Nobody with Naturally Wavy Hair Can Be Trusted

759
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,990
Is this really Edo?

760
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,900
No, it is called Tokyo now.

761
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,450
Following the war,

762
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,820
Edo was reborn and entered
a period of sustained development.

763
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,570
But Tokyo wouldn't be what it is today

764
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,360
without the efforts you all put in.

765
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,900
So the world has returned to peace.

766
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,230
Welcome to Kabuki First District!

767
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,240
But...

768
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,570
It no longer appears to be
the world I know.

769
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:53,200
What became of everyone
after the war?

770
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,700
You already know the answer to that.

771
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,280
What?

772
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,700
Tama.

773
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Tama?

774
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,490
Shinpachi!

775
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,110
When you finally wake up

776
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,900
and obtain this data, who knows
how much time will have passed?

777
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,030
Just what did we fight against?

778
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,030
What did we defeat?

779
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,240
Or were we defeated ourselves?

780
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:39,740
There's still no clear answer to that,
but we did make it back.

781
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:41,700
Back to Edo,

782
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,860
and back to our usual
lives.

783
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,360
But when I saw Gin's slightly
sad smile,

784
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,780
I started to fully realize...

785
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,740
the significance of the things
we'd regained

786
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,820
and the things we'd lost.

787
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,360
I wonder...

788
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,900
if he'll be back...

789
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,450
Where do you think you're sleeping, Gin?

790
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,030
Ugh! I stepped on his puke!

791
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,240
I was wondering
where you'd run off to,

792
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,240
and you were out drinking
it up again?!

793
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,900
Shut up. This is my own place.

794
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,650
I'm free to come home when I want
and puke where I want.

795
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,360
Hey! Don't make an even bigger mess—

796
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:43,900
- I see.
- Who said you can take my seat?

797
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,360
What are you talking about?

798
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,740
I'm the leader because I kept Odd Jobs
going while you guys were away!

799
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,820
And you're starting over as a lackey!
This was your idea!

800
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,400
I said nothing of the sort.

801
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,490
You were the one who said
you'd start over as a glasses frame.

802
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,780
I did not say that! I think you need
to start over from your dad's skin!

803
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,740
You go start over from
your old man's glasses case.

804
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,570
That'd just make me
my old man's glasses!

805
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,900
And just sleep in your bed...

806
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,740
Don't just waltz into a lady's room!

807
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,360
How many times
do I need to tell you?

808
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,780
Since I came back second, I'm the COO,

809
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,200
and this is my room now!

810
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,990
Uh, COO? You blew away the
CEO too, you know?

811
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:25,240
CEOs everywhere are just figureheads.
They're all Lay-Z good for nothings.

812
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,570
The real power rests in the hands
of strong women like Goriki and myself.

813
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,900
Might just makes right wherever you go.

814
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,070
Goriki and you are very
different definitions of strong!

815
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,650
And she was never a COO!

816
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,900
Put that worthless fool
in the closet where he belongs.

817
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:42,740
Uh, Goriki Muscles-Carter,
the closet was a no-go too.

818
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,610
Damn it! Knock it off, you louts!

819
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,570
Where do I belong in this place, then?

820
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,360
Guess I'll go ahead
and mark all my spots.

821
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,700
You wanna die, lackey?

822
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:55,900
But still, we remain the same as always,

823
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,110
and it must be because
all four of us are back together again.

824
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,780
Good grief.

825
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:10,320
I was hoping you'd have made a bunch
of money to pay off your rent,

826
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,280
but it looks like two years passed

827
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,570
while you were sitting
around picking your nose.

828
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,650
I'll let the new CEO handle the rent.

829
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,900
Could you not force me into the role
whenever things go south?

830
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,900
Leave it to me, your leader.

831
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,570
I'll handle the right nostril,
and Gin can take the left one.

832
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,860
Shinpachi can do the rest.

833
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,530
Do something other
than picking your nose!

834
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:35,150
Idiots. And here I thought
Shinpachi and Kagura had grown.

835
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,900
But the moment you come back,
they're right back to square one.

836
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:45,150
One bad apple can
spoil the barrel, as they say.

837
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,490
I'd rather be one of those sweet
canned apples than one in a barrel.

838
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,900
Makes sense.

839
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,110
If you're locked up in the can,

840
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,280
you can go bad and it
won't affect the whole.

841
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,650
Can we stop assuming
that I'm a bad apple?

842
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,320
Everyone busted our balls,

843
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,700
but nobody asked any questions
about why we came back here.

844
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,490
Because the answer's already obvious.

845
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,320
Let me ask you a question in turn.

846
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:13,360
Why do I travel across space
to come see you here?

847
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:15,860
- Because you're bald.
- Leave my scalp alone.

848
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,570
Or maybe it's because...

849
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:21,030
- you're bald.
- Again, that's not it.

850
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,400
There's no particular reason.

851
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:27,400
You don't need one to see family.

852
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,740
This is the same.

853
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:33,490
If you want to stay here
and be Odd Jobs again,

854
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,450
you don't need a reason anymore.

855
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,280
But that's also why
that disastrous brother of yours

856
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:43,610
might show up here without a reason.

857
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:48,650
Kagura said Umibozu looked a little sad
as he left with those words...

858
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,650
and pretty damn bald.

859
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,360
Well, whatever.

860
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:57,530
I won't complain as long you as pay rent.

861
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,200
They say we've entered
a new era and all.

862
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,240
Surely there'll be some
good news to kick it off.

863
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,860
Have a look at this.

864
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,810
EDO News

865
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,810
Rebuilding the Terminal

866
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,400
Can you believe how well
the rebuild of the Terminal is going?

867
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:12,150
No matter how many
obstacles we have to face,

868
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,360
as long as we never give up,

869
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:18,110
we should be able to get back up
as many times as it takes.

870
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,400
So please, everyone...

871
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:23,200
Princess Soyo, I hate to interrupt,
but we're here to ask you

872
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,530
about the assassination of
former PM, Donald Zuramp.

873
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:30,860
Rumors say you masterminded it.
Is it true?

874
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,360
If you believe the princess
to be the kind of person

875
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,200
to kill those in her way,

876
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:45,900
then you stand here ready
to die, I take it?

877
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:47,280
Nobume...

878
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:51,570
A-An assassin!
Those rumors were true!

879
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,820
Edo only managed to get back on its feet

880
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:57,610
thanks to these girls.

881
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,570
Actually, I'm sure they had on their side

882
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,240
those three men, and...

883
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,400
One more person.

884
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,650
You fools!

885
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:13,400
These little girls could never
do the great Zuramp in!

886
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:17,780
That man continues to watch over
this nation as a heroic spirit!

887
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,450
Never forget!

888
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,030
If you stray from the right path,

889
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,780
I will return to punish you!

890
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,610
- I am the Heroic Patriot ObaZ!
- Heroic Patriot ObaZ

891
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,280
And so, Katsura died.

892
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,780
Don't take over the narration
and kill people off!

893
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,610
We don't even know that's Katsura!

894
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,240
It's obviously him, though!

895
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,610
That idiot's already braindead.
Let him go.

896
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,860
And this... narration thing
you've been doing? When's that gonna end?

897
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,490
You heard all that?
Talk about embarrassing!

898
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,200
No, I just wanted to make something
to tell Tama what happened.

899
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:56,530
You trying to forcefully wrap up
this story with a sappy narration?

900
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,450
Too long; didn't listen.

901
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,700
You need to keep these things concise.

902
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,570
Tama.

903
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,780
A lot's happened since then,

904
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,530
but I just want you to know this...

905
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,450
- Everybody died.
- Don't take the easy way out!

906
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,200
What's the problem?
Everyone dies eventually.

907
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,570
It's too lazy!

908
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:20,450
Tama will want more details
on what happened!

909
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,570
Shinpachi's right.

910
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,570
Everything that happened
while she wasn't around,

911
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,110
and the emotions we felt...

912
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:29,570
I want her to know all of it.

913
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,490
The egg rolls were yum.

914
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,280
Nobody gives a solitary shit!

915
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:38,240
I hope you saw all that.

916
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,450
"Without supervision,
people will even stoop

917
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,900
- to falsifying endings."
- Who?

918
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,320
Not me!

919
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,070
Society needs watchful eyes

920
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,070
that can monitor people
and nations across eras.

921
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,900
And the only one capable
of that is the Heroic Spirit...

922
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,990
ObaZ, and ObaZ alone!

923
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:03,150
We ignore him,
and he even sneaks in here?

924
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,610
Either way, that takes care
of one problem.

925
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,990
Who's next?

926
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,740
Quit trying to force
an everbody died ending!

927
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,200
And that...

928
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,200
would be the last time
he played the straight man.

929
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,820
I'm not dead!

930
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,360
Don't worry! I'm not handing
over the narration!

931
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,610
The Zuramp Administration handed
things over to the next generation,

932
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,700
and with that, the Shinsengumi
returned to power.

933
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,780
I'd like to say, Welcome back,

934
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,780
but what you've returned to...

935
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:34,900
is a warzone.

936
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,700
Are you prepared to die?

937
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:43,490
Then drink until you drop!

938
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,610
There are no breaks in their war.

939
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,900
A life like that can get
overwhelming at times,

940
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:59,530
but they'll be fine,
because they have her.

941
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,900
The woman who once rebuffed
all the moves Kondo tried on her

942
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,280
now supports him wholly in both
his professional and personal life.

943
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:12,610
I'm a little saddened by that,
but I'll accept it for Sis's happiness.

944
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,740
Ah, maybe I have
grown from boy to man.

945
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,030
Have a taste of the straight
man's comeback, then!

946
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,490
Are you the one bullshiting the narration?

947
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,900
Just kidding.

948
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,990
It's just, when I see my
future brother-in-law,

949
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,650
I get this urge to play around with him.

950
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,530
Stop that. I'm right here.

951
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,700
And you, Sis!

952
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,400
Why are you going along
with the fake narration?

953
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,900
Huh? I did nothing of the sort.

954
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,860
I was just...

955
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:47,900
Yo, Gorilla.

956
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:50,030
Didn't I say you'd
have to pay triple price

957
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,530
if you showed your face here again?

958
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,450
You were saying some crazy things
during the narration!

959
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:56,570
Yes.

960
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,780
My wallet—No, the government's coffers...

961
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,530
belong to you now.

962
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,240
Take this.

963
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,360
It's a B'z concert ticket.

964
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:08,740
Damn, Gorilla, you're naughty.

965
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,450
Not as much as you, Otae.

966
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:12,990
This is just footage
of official corruption!

967
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,990
You used the narration to hide it, huh?

968
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:17,570
Hey. You ate up all that screen time,

969
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,240
and what you did is still stupid,
what did you do, idiots?

970
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,610
Master, that was a bit better, no?

971
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:28,320
I don't need a fake narration,

972
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,700
as long as I have this.

973
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,360
You're wrapping things up?
Okay, you get one minute.

974
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,100
Special Police Shinsengumi

975
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,070
Things went back
to how they used to be.

976
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,740
But that only signaled...

977
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,860
the start of a new battle
for the Shinsengumi.

978
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:46,360
Special: Shinsengumi Kenpucho

979
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:49,400
Forget ending, we're getting
a new preview!

980
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,860
What is the Shinsengumi's new battle?

981
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,700
Who is their new foe?

982
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,400
That's not new at all!
We saw him earlier!

983
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,490
What is the Shinsengumi's new weapon?

984
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,600
Sagaru Yamazaki Develops...

985
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,650
- Hey, what happened...

986
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,670
108 split personalities when revived!

987
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,200
- to Blandy?

988
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:06,030
It ain't easy being Vice Chief, huh?

989
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,490
But I'll keep the Shinsengumi going,

990
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,780
just like you would have...

991
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:13,860
Hijikata...

992
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,030
You're falsifying the narration too?

993
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,700
What do you louts think
you're doing instead of working?

994
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,280
Kill yourselves to atone
for your lack of discipline!

995
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,490
Hijikata, everything's over
after this movie.

996
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,700
We won't get paid for any extra work.

997
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,490
I mean, just look at Yamazaki.

998
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:32,200
He's playing mechabaddi
with the Mechazakis.

999
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,990
Again... What the hell is mechabaddi?

1000
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:37,400
What the hell are Mechazakis?!

1001
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,900
Vice Chief, Vice Chief!

1002
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:42,280
We get that none of you guys
have any idea how to wrap things up.

1003
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,740
Just take this.

1004
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:45,700
Now pose.

1005
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,900
Good. Keep it up.

1006
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,860
Don't just walk away!

1007
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,360
Why the hell did you make me do this?

1008
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:00,860
The Shinsengumi was... y'know.

1009
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:04,280
"Y'know" what? Who sums
anything up like that?

1010
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,740
Don't be so on edge, Hijikata.

1011
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,450
This is the end. Take it easy.

1012
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:11,650
There is no end to the police's job!

1013
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,860
I see.

1014
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,110
So it's the police's job
to shout and cause mayhem

1015
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,780
at a private establishment?

1016
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,860
If so, then I shall do my job as well.

1017
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,320
Kyubei...

1018
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,900
Go on, then. What is your job?

1019
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:26,650
Why don't you show me...

1020
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,360
Fruit platter.

1021
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,700
- Say aah.
- Aah.

1022
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,650
Wait, your job's cabaret girl?!

1023
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,650
When I invited her to come hang out,
she insisted on helping.

1024
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,360
I came up with a way to serve men
without approaching them.

1025
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,650
I can be ranked number one with this!

1026
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,900
Don't make a girl who measures
personal space with her sword

1027
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:46,860
serve patrons!

1028
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,400
It's a sales tactic.

1029
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,570
In Yoshiwara,
they often play hard-to-get,

1030
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,530
making the customers
more obsessed with them!

1031
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:01,070
Otae.
Cleanup completed.

1032
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,990
Forget hard-to-get,
this is hard-to-survive!

1033
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,650
Gin... You can't...

1034
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:10,400
And I have zero idea
what this idiot's trying to do!

1035
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:13,320
Hey, I came to hang out like you asked,

1036
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:15,490
but there are no uggos here.

1037
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,320
There's your order.

1038
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,320
Tsukky! Kyu!

1039
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,610
Kagura.

1040
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,200
Have you been well?

1041
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,740
Yup! You were all here, huh?

1042
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,030
Yes. All of us.

1043
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,450
Talk about a self-centered bunch.

1044
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,490
They all show up to bask
in the ending's spotlight.

1045
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,820
But now, we can wrap up
all their stories in the narration.

1046
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,650
How do we do that, exactly?

1047
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,400
Everybody got black-out
drunk together?

1048
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,150
Hey, that doesn't sound too bad.

1049
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,530
It suits us perfectly, does it not?

1050
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:54,570
Yeah... Same as always.

1051
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:58,900
That might just be the perfect
phrase for us.

1052
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,280
Come on, keep it together!

1053
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,780
Hey! What makes you think I'm not?

1054
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,450
Want me to list all of Dragon Ball's
adversaries to prove it

1055
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,780
By saying that,
you already proved that you don't!

1056
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,280
Doctor G—

1057
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,700
Hey, lady.

1058
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,900
Ten more of this.

1059
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,610
Come on, give it a rest.

1060
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,570
We're poor now.
We don't have any backers.

1061
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,320
But food on Earth is so good.

1062
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:32,280
Besides, they say you can't
fight on an empty stomach.

1063
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,900
Fight? We can't afford to.

1064
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,780
Then... I'll look forward
to when we can.

1065
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,320
Here, lady.

1066
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:46,280
Next time, I'll come to feast
on Earth itself.

1067
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:49,900
Yeesh. That's some big words.

1068
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,780
Dream big, money or no money.

1069
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:55,200
You nincompoop.

1070
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,860
- G-Good job noticing us!
- "Well done!"

1071
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,110
(lol)

1072
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,290
Odd Jobs Gin

1073
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,190
From Tatsuma Sakamoto

1074
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,290
From Tatsuma Sakamoto

1075
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:16,900
"We haven't talked in a while."

1076
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,200
"How have you been,"

1077
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,900
"Peentoki?"

1078
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,110
"I'm flying across
the universe as always."

1079
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,110
"Space really is the best."

1080
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:32,240
"You should join me
on a trip sometime, Cuntoki."

1081
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,030
"The reason I'm writing to you"

1082
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,450
"is because I have something to say."

1083
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,110
"That day,"

1084
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,400
"I promised to rescue you all,"

1085
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,030
"but when I saw
the Terminal crumble down,"

1086
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:51,030
"'they ded lololol'"

1087
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:53,240
"was my first thought."

1088
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,070
"I don't mean this as consolation
or anything."

1089
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:05,280
"I truly believe he saved you back then."

1090
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,280
"So you don't need to
beat yourself up over it."

1091
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:14,110
"Your teacher's soul lives on
everywhere on Earth,"

1092
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:18,240
"and he continues
to watch over you, I'm sure."

1093
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:21,320
"To my beloved friend,"

1094
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,990
"Peencunfuku."

1095
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,740
"P.S. here's something I heard
when I ran into Zura the other day."

1096
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:33,110
"The remnants of the Kiheitai
are making strange moves, it seems."

1097
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,990
"The gates?"

1098
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,280
"Indeed."

1099
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,450
"Who do you think you're mimicking?"

1100
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:45,240
"She probably couldn't stand the fact
that she was so powerless."

1101
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,570
"But she was thankful"

1102
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:53,240
"that she could see him smile again
after he was a prisoner was so long."

1103
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,990
"And she says..."

1104
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:01,150
"it's her turn now."

1105
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,320
"There is no chance of him
coming back to life like Utsuro did."

1106
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,200
"That was a miracle which only occurred"

1107
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,650
"because Utsuro was born from Altana."

1108
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,900
"That's just fine."

1109
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:18,070
"This is how we,"

1110
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:21,860
"the Kiheitai, atone for our sins."

1111
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,110
"Takechi... You too?"

1112
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,320
"You're abandoning me too?"

1113
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,700
"Here's what I believe."

1114
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:46,490
"Miracles aren't real."

1115
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:06,740
"When a teacher
protects his student,"

1116
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,110
"you can't call that a miracle."

1117
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,610
"That's..."

1118
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:22,320
"just what they do."

1119
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:27,900
Ken
Shimura

1120
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,430
Ken
Shimura

1121
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:28,900
Ken
Shimura

1122
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,200
Ken
Shimura

1123
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,110
Oh, you're here?

1124
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:36,990
It's been a while since
we came to see Father together.

1125
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,820
Do you have any news for him?

1126
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,200
Nah.

1127
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,820
As he died, our father lamented
the state of Edo's skies,

1128
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:56,570
but to me, even these same old skies
look a tad different now.

1129
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:08,240
After all, we know...

1130
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:12,570
that the people we care about
live under these skies.

1131
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,320
They might get cloudy at times,

1132
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,900
but in our hearts...

1133
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:30,740
Beneath my skies live
all the people I love so much.

1134
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,530
So, Tama,

1135
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:50,200
even if you find yourself
beneath unfamiliar skies,

1136
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:52,990
please don't cry.

1137
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:57,900
We'll always remain
in your heart with you.

1138
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,490
And if you'll believe in that,

1139
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,700
then I'm sure...

1140
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,570
we'll come to you
and wipe your tears away.

1141
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,900
Odd Jobs Gin

1142
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,900
Snack Otose

1143
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,990
Let's keep going.

1144
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:36,700
-After that, these girls went on
to live as citizens of the modern age.

1145
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,900
The world was entering
a golden age of technology.

1146
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Machines, and not people,
were to be the new leaders.

1147
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,900
These girls were robots,
so they lived happy lives.

1148
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,650
And humans...

1149
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,360
ended up unemployed.

1150
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,570
Each and every one of them.

1151
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:01,740
If nobody has a job, they can't call
anyone out for being unemployed.

1152
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,530
The jobless will blend in.

1153
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,700
Everyone will be happy.

1154
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:10,360
Every single person... can be happy...

1155
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,280
Mister Hasegawa?

1156
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,570
Why's he here in the future?

1157
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:20,400
Tamako, let me tell you
how this story really ends.

1158
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,850
Unemployed State: Dangerously Drunk

1159
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,900
Edo's going to turn into... hic...

1160
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:27,700
Number 0... the data I gave you
might have contained

1161
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,240
some massive errors!

1162
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,700
Massive errors?

1163
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,700
- You're bullshitting the narration too?
- You're bullshitting the narration too?

1164
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,900
What the hell did you tell Tamako?!

1165
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,110
No!

1166
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:45,900
I was just saying how hard it was to
find work after I quit being the hero...

1167
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:49,990
My apologies. This world we perceived

1168
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,860
was bugged out by the inclusion
of Hasegawa's data.

1169
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:59,320
The real world...

1170
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:06,900
-Hey. Good morning.

1171
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,490
You still look half-asleep.

1172
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,490
Whatever.

1173
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:16,240
We've got some urgent work
to take care of.

1174
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,450
Let's catch up later.

1175
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,530
Huh? Wait, Gin!

1176
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,820
Oh, and... you don't need us to
wipe those tears away, right?

1177
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:32,320
Looks like the clouds upstairs
have stopped crying, too.

1178
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:35,150
The skies have cleared up.

1179
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,400
Let's go.

1180
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,400
Hey, Gin, where are we going?

1181
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,400
What's this urgent work we have?

1182
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,700
- What was it?
- You forgot? Wasn't it urgent?!

1183
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:56,360
What was it, Leader?

1184
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,610
Beats me.

1185
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,280
Well, hey, it doesn't matter what.

1186
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,990
After all,

1187
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,650
we're the Odd Jobs!

1188
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:24,120
GINTAMA
The final

1189
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,700
- "Teach us, Ginpachi-sensei"
- Class 3-Z...

1190
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:09,990
Teach us, Ginpachi-sensei!

1191
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:13,280
Stand, bow, take your seats.

1192
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:14,780
Listen up, kids.

1193
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:17,240
Both the manga and movie
have reached the final chapter.

1194
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:20,700
So you guys, who'd been repeating
year after year, finally get to graduate too.

1195
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:24,150
On that note, say hello to the new
transfer student, Hideaki Sorachi.

1196
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:27,860
He says you can ask him
anything right now and he'll answer.

1197
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,320
Sensei! How are we supposed to
communite with a gorilla?!

1198
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:33,860
What's he saying?
All I hear is "ooh".

1199
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,400
- Me too?
- Sensei,

1200
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:39,150
a place with multiple gorillas
is a zoo, not a school.

1201
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,900
- May I go home?
-Okay, I get it.

1202
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:43,070
Kondo, Sorachi, and Otae,
go home to your cages now.

1203
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,450
Excuse me.

1204
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:48,150
I can interpret for you
if you'd like, Sensei.

1205
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,610
You're the Sensei, Shoyo.

1206
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:51,900
As someone who's been
repeating eternity,

1207
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,820
I can understand their language.

1208
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,200
A guy who repeats forever
is just an idiot, Shoyo.

1209
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,900
This is the question Kondo has:

1210
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:01,700
Getting kicked off of Jump,
two final chapter scams,

1211
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:04,240
and multiple delays...
Why did all that happen?

1212
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,280
I would never ask such a dangerous
question! He really is an idiot, Sensei!

1213
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:10,570
Oh, I see. Is that what happened?

1214
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,700
Sensei! You didn't need
an interpreter after all?!

1215
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,610
It's a delicate matter,
so I'll bananacoat it.

1216
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,700
Sugarcoat it instead, Sensei.

1217
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,150
- "I was busy playing Sekiro"
- It's like this.

1218
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,900
Sensei! The banana peel isn't working!
The Sekiro is there for all to see!

1219
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:24,030
Forget the banana.

1220
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:27,240
It seems things got crazy after Isshin
tore his way out of Genichiro's back.

1221
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,070
Stop talking about Sekiro.
It'll cause online drama.

1222
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,900
- Anybody else got questions?
- I'm too scared to ask!

1223
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,070
Me, Sensei.

1224
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:36,740
We never got any details
about Gintoki Sakata's origins.

1225
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,280
Who is he, actually?

1226
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:41,900
There's a fan theory that says
he's half-Amanto due to having silver hair.

1227
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,780
Does that mean Sacchan
with her purple hair

1228
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:45,900
is half-Osakan hag?

1229
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,700
Rude! And how can you even be
half an Osakan hag?

1230
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,530
Don't worry, Sarutobi.
You aren't an Osakan hag.

1231
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,240
You're only halfway there,
so Nagoyan hag.

1232
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,240
So I'm still a hag?!

1233
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,530
Does that mean
the silver-haired man is...

1234
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,700
...half-Sugamo geezer?

1235
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,240
I hate to say it,
but you're all wrong.

1236
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,320
Keep it between us,

1237
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,070
but the bananacoated
reason for the silver hair is...

1238
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:08,920
Because manga

1239
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,280
Too blunt, Sensei!

1240
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,860
Do your damn job, banana peel!

1241
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:10,650
Any other questions?

1242
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,860
Enough, Sensei!
We'll just dig our own graves!

1243
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:16,650
Okay. I shall turn
everything hollow, then,

1244
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,530
with this one question to end them all.

1245
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:19,530
Bad news, Sensei.

1246
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:22,740
Shoyo's other persona,
Hollow Brain has come out.

1247
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:25,280
He's going to ask something real bad!

1248
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,150
Sorachi, do you...

1249
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,240
...count bananas as snacks?

1250
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,650
- Whoa, it's Shoyo!
- Stay out of this, Shoyo!

1251
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:35,070
What I want to ask is,
do you count bananas as royalties?

1252
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,360
Nah, bananas count as snacks, right?

1253
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,280
Looks like both their questions
are trash.

1254
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,280
- Banana is royalties!
- Banana is a snack!

1255
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,990
Somebody stop those two...
I mean, that one moron.

1256
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,320
Any other questions?

1257
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,030
Sensei! What was that ObaZ
stuff all about?

1258
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,610
You need to drop it already.

1259
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:53,320
Sensei. In the end, am I dead?

1260
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:55,240
Or am I alive? Which is it?

1261
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,860
It's Takasugi! The one whose survival
was left up in the air in the movie!

1262
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:04,570
It was obviously left vague
so people could have hope.

1263
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:08,490
Are you prepared to accept reality,
cruel as it may be?

1264
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,400
Yeah.

1265
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,530
"Okay, I'll just be honest and say"

1266
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:14,150
- "I didn't want to waste pages on that."
- Too blunt!

1267
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,700
- "Rather than expand on Takasugi's fate,"
- Bananacoat it!

1268
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:16,990
"I wanted to fit in
as many jokes as I could."

1269
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:18,490
Not that I care,

1270
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:21,490
but we can decide if
Takasugi's alive or dead by vote.

1271
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,360
Don't use democracy
to decide one's fate!

1272
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:27,740
Okay. Was that bare butt Takasugi's ass
or some random kid's ass?

1273
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,860
Pick what you like.

1274
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,030
Sensei, why are there two votes already?

1275
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,030
- Sekiro for me, then.
- Me too!

1276
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:34,360
- Sensei.
- Me three.

1277
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:36,360
One vote for everybody died.

1278
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:42,150
FIN
