1
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,667
Man, I'm so nervous.

2
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,555
Yes?

3
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,463
Hey, lookin' sharp!

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,384
Oh, isshiki. Why are you here?

5
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,264
My best friend's getting married!
So, why wouldn't I be?

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,641
But I don't remember inviting you.

7
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,144
Well, you should've! I mean, I'm pretty
sure the invitation just didn't arrive.

8
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,273
Oh, I guess that means you weren't invited!

9
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,946
Don't talk like I don't matter to you!

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,449
But anyway, I can't believe
you made it this far.

11
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,286
Who would've expected that you'd be marrying
the fourth cutest girl in our class?

12
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,784
I've gotta try harder!

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,542
How are things going with kumin-senpai?

14
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,172
Perfect!

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,540
It's open.

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,292
Togashi-kun, it's almost time.

17
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,007
Kumin-senpai, long time no see!

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,423
Oh, umm... nice to meet you.

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,599
I was in the same club as togashi-kun.
My name's kumin tsuyuri.

20
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,558
Kumin-senpai...

21
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,061
It's me, makoto isshiki!

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,861
Isshiki-San? How do you know togashi-kun?

23
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,575
Look!

24
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,358
That was a wig?!

25
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,576
Oh, you're a monk?!

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,822
Was togashi having a
Buddhist wedding ceremony?

27
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,249
Oh, kumin-senpai...

28
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,368
You should seriously give up.

29
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,462
It's been two years since we met.

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,042
I never expected things would
turn out this way, though.

31
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,136
Rikkal

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,554
hey, are you all right?

33
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,428
Today...

34
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,022
I'm marrying rikka.

35
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,524
Well, stay strong, okay?

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
Thanks.

37
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,280
Don't worry about it.

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,197
Anyway, is that idiot really going to
skip out on the wedding?

39
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,953
She isn't inside?

40
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,992
No, I checked earlier.

41
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,877
Dekomori is my servant, one who has shared
the same fate as me until now.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,462
I'm pretty sure she
cannot accept this pact.

43
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,546
It's almost time, so please get ready.

44
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,172
See ya.

45
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,598
Yuta...

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,602
What is it?

47
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,135
I'm embarrassed.

48
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,307
No worries.

49
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:12,817
I am, too!

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,399
Yutal

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,150
Congratulations!

52
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,948
Rikka looks so pretty!
Congratulations!

53
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,868
I'm so happy for them.

54
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
You should wipe your nose, morisummer-chan.

55
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,043
Don't call me that!

56
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,009
Now, you may kiss the bride.

57
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,924
Rikka...

58
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,441
What?!

59
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,532
Hey, look! A dark beast!

60
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,650
What?!

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,901
Hey, knock it off!

62
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,913
Yuta, that hurt!

63
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,410
Where do you think we are?! We're in
a church... at a wedding, you know!

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,127
What does that matter?!

65
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,664
Even if it's about to be
concealed by a barrier of light,

66
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,920
I can summon the power of darkness
with my wicked lord shingan!

67
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,253
What are you talking about?!

68
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,727
Besides, our pact ended when you saw
my wicked lord shingan.

69
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,891
What is the point of having a ceremony
corrupted by ordinary society?

70
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,683
You wanna call it quits, then?

71
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,522
No way.

72
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,272
Then what do you want? Spit it out already!

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,741
Oww! Yuta, that hurts!
Then what do you want? Spit it out already!

74
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,076
Enough of this charade!

75
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,122
Whose voice is that?

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,955
Huh?

77
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,664
That idiot!

78
00:04:53,794 --> 00:05:00,882
As master's servant, I, sanae dekomori, will
never approve of your wedding and new pact.

79
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,211
Look! Up there!

80
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,384
Master is my master!

81
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,146
Now... master, come with me.

82
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,274
Dekomori, I...

83
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,570
Master!

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,990
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,710
Fine, then...

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,627
Then I'll reduce everything to ash!

87
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,095
Yutal

88
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,811
Is this barrier a new power of yours?

89
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:05,813
Schwarz zx prototype Mark iv's
miasma degeneration barrier.

90
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,406
It blocks all magic attacks.

91
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,200
Everyone, get out of here while
you still have a chance.

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,035
Be careful, rikka.

93
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,119
Let's go, yumehal!

94
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,489
You're so cool, rikka!

95
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,167
Spirit of the atmosphere,
let us join forces!

96
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:49,982
"His hook, he baited with a dragon's tail."

97
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,302
Huh?

98
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,346
Ah! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

99
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,311
Get a good taste of your punishment
for trying to take master away from me!

100
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,188
Morisummer-chan!

101
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,062
Kumin-senpai!

102
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,943
Isshiki!

103
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,118
Kumin!

104
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,320
Don't worry, I received powers, too!

105
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,290
9:08 is kumin time!

106
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,286
The time has come. Awaken, hypnos!

107
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,291
You should sleep for all eternity!

108
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,011
Explosive sleeping!

109
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,872
What good is it if you fall asleep?!
What good does it do if you fall asleep?!

110
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:04,856
Wedding cakes are the most
dangerous food in this world...

111
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,898
Yutal

112
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:06,808
hmph!

113
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,855
I have no choice!

114
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:21,159
Emerging from the deepest darkness of
carnage, dark flame master... has arrived!

115
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,543
Damn you!

116
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:31,041
Just the mere thought of challenging me with
a dragon was a mistake, sanae dekomori...

117
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,293
Or should I say Mjolnir hammer?!

118
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,967
Wh-what do you mean?

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,554
Hmph.

120
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,926
Have you forgotten about
that which dwells within me?

121
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,895
The dark dragon?

122
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,058
No, the dragon within me
is beyond that level.

123
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,685
It has evolved into the dark flame dragon!

124
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,690
In its 4000-year history,

125
00:08:54,701 --> 00:09:00,992
the dark flame dragon only allowed six who
possess dark power to be its vessel...

126
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,255
That is what's inside him?

127
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,298
Deko!

128
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,396
Then, it seems my only option
is to use my special finishing move, too.

129
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,640
Here I go!

130
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,236
Apocalypse hammer!

131
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,272
Yuta, let's do it!

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,826
Rikkal

133
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,326
bridal attack!

134
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,910
In sickness...

135
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,624
And in health...

136
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,910
To love and to Cherish...

137
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,127
And I promise to be faithful...

138
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,749
Until death do us part!

139
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,982
What an awful wedding souvenir!

140
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,074
Rikkal

141
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,078
yutal

142
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,411
yuta...!

143
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,155
What an edgy dream.

144
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,785
Rafflesias are better with sauce.

145
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,198
Oh, master!

146
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,079
How was the battle in the parallel world?

147
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,375
It was a fierce battle.

148
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,378
Really?

149
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,846
L, dekomori, wish I could have joined you.

150
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,602
Hm?

151
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,222
Where's yuta?

152
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,890
He's not here yet.

153
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:38,688
Don't worry. Dark flame master
told us to believe in him.

154
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,651
So, let's trust him.

155
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,785
You should trust the dark flame master
you believe in, master.

156
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,906
I don't really get what
you're saying, but okay.

157
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,540
I'm sure he'll bring back a
win in this final battle.

158
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,044
Yeah...

159
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:08,638
Anyway, can you tell me what happened
between you and dark flame master?

160
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,176
Huh?

161
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,019
Like, how you two ended up together
when you met in the ancient past.

162
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,732
Dekomori...

163
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,357
I want to hear it, too!

164
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,817
All right, I'll tell you...

165
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:31,160
About how wicked lord shingan and
dark flame master met,

166
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,243
and how we wound up joining forces.

167

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,787
ima ga dondon kasanatte the present
accumulates and paints your days

181
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,374
kimi no hibi o irodotte iku the present
accumulates and paints your days

182
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,121
watashi no sonzai wa nani iro o shiteru?
What color is my existence?

183
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,957
Kore wa tokenai mahou
it's a spell that can't be lifted

184
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:09,179
“tabun zutto suki da yo" o chikau ne
I swear to probably keep loving you

185
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,412
Embarrassing! Embarrassing!
Embarrassing! Embarrassing! Embarrassing!

186
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,576
Forget it! Forget it! Forget it!
Forget it! Forget it!

187
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,079
When wicked lord shingan
and dark flame master met,

188
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,163
dark flame master was suffering

189
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:49,295
from the dissonance between his past
and memories he created in the present.

190
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,678
So I extended a helping hand.

191
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,433
That was the beginning.

192
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,972
Ow!

193
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,619
You saw?

194
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:13,985
Huh?

195
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,452
Uh, no!

196
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,665
Wanna see?

197
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Huh?!

198
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,098
It opened!

199
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,851
My name is dark flame master.

200
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,645
Be enveloped in the flames
of darkness and die!

201
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,977
Mm-hmm!

202
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,859
Sealed! Up! Forever!

203
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,281
Our paths have crossed at last, eh?

204
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,403
My eye! My eye is resonating!

205
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,746
You know her?

206
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,205
Uh, no, I don't know her!

207
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,540
How many months, years have passed
as I've searched for you...

208
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,753
My eye! My eye!

209
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,006
My eye...!

210
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,298
They said the nurse stepped out,
so you should use some eye drops.

211
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,041
If we don't hurry, the entrance ceremony
will start without us.

212
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,986
You were on my veranda
last night, weren't you?

213
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,357
What are you up to?

214
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,610
Because of my eye... it resonated.

215
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,403
Yes. In times long past,
you and I knew each other.

216
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:39,454
The moment I saw you, wicked lord shingan
told me of our karmic fate.

217
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,281
So I sought a chance to encounter you.

218
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,205
This bitterness! It must
be the dark organization.

219
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,748
Therefore, I seal this.

220
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:56,297
Wicked lord shingan uses the sacred heart
to repress the powers of darkness.

221
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:02,891
Thus, to those sullied by darkness, purified holy water
is fundamentally dangerous and cannot be handled.

222
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,018
I almost fell for the enemy's trap.

223
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,692
We must be careful... dark flame master.

224
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,071
Be enveloped in the flames of dark-

225
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,531
stop that!

226
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,783
How do you know that?
Where did you hear it?

227
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,704
My wicked lord shingan has the power
to see through all things.

228
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,040
Even you, yuta, he with the power
of a level 7 magic user.

229
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:25,658
Where did you hear that?!

230
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,659
He knows all things, past and future, with but
a glance... ugh... where did you hear that?!

231
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,899
He knows all things, past and future,
with but a glance... ugh...

232
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,459
Where did you hear that?!

233
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,296
Yuta, that hurts!

234
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,710
For the last time, where
did you hear that?!

235
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,006
I can't see! Yuta, I can't see! For the
last time, where did you hear that?!

236
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,630
I can't see! Yuta, I can't see!

237
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,466
I heard you when I was outside the gym.

238
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,354
The gym?

239
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,396
I thought no one was listening!

240
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,934
Listen up! You mustn't
tell anyone about this!

241
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,276
I understand.

242
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,569
The laws regarding distortion above the invisible
boundary line and event-based structural variance-

243
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,576
no!

244
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,745
I mean, about my past! About dark flame master,
or being a user of the fires of darkness!

245
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,576
Why not? It's cool.

246
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,949
It's not cool!

247
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,002
Listen. I've decided I'm
through with all that.

248
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,507
Really?

249
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,757
Yeah.

250
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,260
So you're finally a level 8 magic user?

251
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,505
No!

252
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,260
It's just "chunibyo"!

253
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,807
I'm not dark flame master!
I'm just a normal high school freshman!

254
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,189
Can you please stop acting so surprised?

255
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,026
I hate to break it to you,
but you're a normal high schooler, too.

256
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,146
I have wicked lord shingan.

257
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:41,072
That has nothing to do with it.
It doesn't exist, anyway!

258
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,450
It does.

259
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,945
Does not.

260
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,451
You wanna see?

261
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,667
Huh?

262
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,207
My eye. Wanna see?

263
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,376
Sure, show me!

264
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,977
N-no way.

265
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,271
You've gotta be kidding!

266
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,062
Oww...

267
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,189
Owwie.

268
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,323
Ahn!

269
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,660
Hold on. I'll put it back in.

270
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,245
It's just a colored contact?!

271
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,329
When did you start living there?

272
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,874
I thought a single office
lady lived upstairs.

273
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,045
I moved in two days ago.
Toka takanashi is my big sister.

274
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,835
I get it. So you're
living with your sister.

275
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,174
That is the story.

276
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,471
But she's really a sorceress from the invisible
boundary line administration bureau.

277
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,342
The enemy!

278
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,469
Now look here...!

279
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,098
When she awakens, she'll be impossible to
contain, even with wicked lord shingan...

280
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,395
Ugh! How scary!

281
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,018
She's that bad?

282
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,479
Don't lose, rikka! This is it!

283
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,113
Obviously that nonsense will make her mad.

284
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,404
With the power of the dark flame master,

285
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:13,001
we could break through the bureau's resistance
and find the invisible boundary line for sure!

286
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,914
I told you not to mention that name!

287
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,669
I've come up with a new technique for you.

288
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,846
Judgment Lucifer!

289
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Well?

290
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,476
You wear roller shoes?

291
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,595
Are you a kid?

292
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,392
They provide excellent mobility.

293
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,022
Also, with these, when I
come under enemy fire...

294
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,571
Clang! Clang! Skreee!

295
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,992
"You got two or three of my ribs, huh?"

296
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,782
You can do that. How cool!

297
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,870
Don't do that here!

298
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,617
Which do you want? It's my treat.

299
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,422
Hold on.

300
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,839
Up, up, down, down.

301
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,300
Hey, takanashi-San...
Up, up, down, down.

302
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,840
Left, right, left, right.

303
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,802
The train!
Left, right, left, right.

304
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,467
Okay, now put your coins in!

305
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,475
Huh?!

306
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,308
Now's the time! B, al

307
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,594
what do you mean, "b, a"?

308
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,812
This drink will replenish your magic.

309
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,898
The bureau stores it in secret.

310
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,814
But the friggin' train left!

311
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:25,856
You win 1 drink

312
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,608
you win 1 drink you won!
Good job!

313
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,785
Heh heh heh.

314
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,075
Now you know the depth of my power.

315
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,573
Nope. You looked like you
were not expecting that.

316
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,544
Oww!

317
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,620
B-brother, who is this?

318
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,749
The younger sister of takanashi, the
neighbor above us. She's moving in with her.

319
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,295
Oh, really?

320
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:49,138
Why do you have so much stuff?
Isn't this a bit much for one person?

321
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,556
All of it is important.

322
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,056
Not everything in these is junk, right?

323
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,141
I also have practical items.

324
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,597
It's automatic!

325
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,225
It turns into a weapon: Gungnir! Take that!

326
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,773
And for defense...

327
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,396
Schwarz shield!

328
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,318
Schwarz shield!

329
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,032
All right already.

330
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,995
Here.

331
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,953
Just take these.

332
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,249
All right, fine!

333
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,056
That's the last of 'em.

334
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,179
Thank you. I'm grateful.

335
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,311
Yeah, you better be.

336
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,363
Where's your sister?

337
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,403
She always comes home late.

338
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,648
Really?

339
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,160
Oh, you're takanashi-San's sister?

340
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,621
You're both so pretty.

341
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,823
Yuta, you'll have to work hard.

342
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,120
At what?

343
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,494
Um, is your eye okay?

344
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,005
Don't worry about it. There's
nothing wrong with it at all.

345
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,343
Wicked lord shingan has long repressed
the forces of darkness with holy power-

346
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,342
you don't have to give her an explanation.

347
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,509
Understood.

348
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,264
Begone!

349
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,268
Ow! Begone!

350
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,019
Yumeha, you can't just
grab whatever you want-

351
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:19,512
take that! Yumeha, you can't
just grab whatever you want-

352
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,523
ow!

353
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,643
So cool!

354
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,102
It's not cool.

355
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,392
It's cool!

356
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,395
If you put that on your
back, it'd be perfect!

357
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,612
Perfect?

358
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,076
Brother used to do that. He'd have that
on his back while he was in a black coat.

359
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,078
Kuzuha!

360
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,075
You were a little strange back then, yuta.

361
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,541
You'd chant spells or
whatever before eating.

362
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,752
Mom! It's time for your night shift!

363
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,794
Hmph.

364
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,083
Fine.

365
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,584
I swear!

366
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,712
I told them this is trash, so
they shouldn't go touching it.

367
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,588
Trash?

368
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Huh?

369
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah.

370
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,057
That's dark flame master's lifeblood.

371
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,682
I told you, didn't I? I'm
through with that stuff.

372
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,932
Why?

373
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,897
'Cause it's embarrassing.

374
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,234
It's cool.

375
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,112
It's not cool.

376
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,859
Not somethin' like this!

377
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,945
Besides, all that stuff is meaningless.

378
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,203
The flames of darkness and
the dark flame dragon don't exist.

379
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,251
It's childish.

380
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,630
No, it has power.

381
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,006
It doesn't.

382
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
It does.

383
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,298
Now look here...!

384
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,848
It does.

385
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,465
So...

386
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,768
I don't want you to throw it away.

387
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,650
Be enveloped in the
flames of darkness and disappear!

388
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,628
Don't get me wrong.

389
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,965
I just think it'd be a
waste to throw it away.

390
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,541
I'l make some money
selling it in an auction or something.

391
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,806
Yeah!

392
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,976
My place is on the second floor. Takanashi-San
lives in the apartment above me.

393
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,397
Disabling magical code.

394
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,188
Just open it already.

395
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,777
Shhh!

396
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,774
It opened. At last, it opened!

397
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,321
You sure are a pain.

398
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,819
Just a moment.

399
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,497
I'll search and make sure
nothing is amiss here.

400
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,830
Well, it was wrong of us to
just invite ourselves over.

401
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,328
She's a lady, after all.

402
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,591
Welcome to the dark side.

403
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,215
Enter the formless chaos.

404
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,592
That's kind of the same thing.

405
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,306
You like cute stuffed animals, don't you?

406
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,349
That's genbu, protector of the north.

407
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,769
It's a military mauser!

408
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,226
That's an unexpectedly cool hobby!

409
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,563
It's a holy pistol that can destroy evil.

410
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,815
It sure looks like it.

411
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,567
Can I see it?

412
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,578
Sure.

413
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,071
Mausers sure are cool.

414
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,740
Ra-ta-ta-ta-tal ka-blam!

415
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,124
U-um! You know, this pistol...

416
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,918
The real thing was an awesome weapon
made over 100 years ago!

417
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,464
And, uh... this is the m712 model...

418
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,505
Togashi-kun, you're into
that type of thing, huh?

419
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,516
Uh...

420
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,637
Whose cat is that?

421
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,267
Huh?

422
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,143
Closing secret partition!

423
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,190
Flooding radiation defense barrier!

424
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,976
All hands, evacuate!

425
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,987
What?!

426
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,486
Togashi-kun, let's run to the
ends of the earth together.

427
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,203
I'll really do it.

428
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,823
The ends of the earth meaning here?

429
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,747
I mean, the planet earth is round!

430
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,630
Hurry up and run.
She's one of the bureau's top priestesses.

431
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,669
How fun. It's like a horror movie.

432
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,136
It's not fun at all!

433
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,340
Something flashed just now!

434
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:27,812
Tsuyuri-San!

435
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,981
Go! Schwarz zx prototype Mark il!

436
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,814
Be destroyed, real! Blow up, synapses!

437
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,156
Vanishment this world!

438
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,996
In accordance with the covenant of blood,
I summon thee!

439
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,798
Konigin der nacht!

440
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,196
Dark matter Blaze!

441
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,627
Takanashi!

442
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,372
Nergal blast!

443
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,044
Gun tinkle!

444
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,437
Cut it out!

445
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:11,114
It's like, "cheerleaders go whoosh up
in the air. I wanna try!" She said.

446
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,872
You sure you're okay?

447
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,167
In the battle to locate the
invisible boundary line,

448
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,084
I flew to a height of several
thousand meters in that world...

449
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,419
No problem.

450
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,588
What is she talking about?

451
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,595
Who knows.

452
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,303
Well? Think you're up for it?

453
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,843
Not good?

454
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,182
N-no problem.

455
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,734
No problem.

456
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,979
Sorry, I know this is sudden.

457
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,607
What is it? What did you want to tell me?

458
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,492
I'm embarrassed, so I'll only say it once.

459
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,914
That is, how I feel about you...

460
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,166
L, o, v, e.

461
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,834
Love!

462
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,418
That tickles... that tickles!

463
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,342
All right, I get it...!

464
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:15,344
It seems you've finally
returned, dark flame master.

465
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,850
Who are you?!

466
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:18,805
Heh!

467
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,651
You're supposed to say your name first
before asking someone for theirs.

468
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,488
I-I'm joking! I'll tell you my name!

469
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,317
Who are you?

470
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,908
Please untie me first.

471
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,613
I am an agent of wicked lord shingan,
rikka takanashi's no. 1 servant...

472
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,291
User of the Mjolnir hammer, sanae dekomori!

473
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,085
I have arrived.

474
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,370
Go home!

475
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,749
L, dekomori, shall purify your soul!

476
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:50,383
Mjolnir tornad-

477
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,432
I can't move.

478
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,439
Idiot.

479
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,851
This chick's... the real thing!

480
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:05,937
I will have dekomori join our
far-east magical napping society.

481
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,854
That makes four members.

482
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,279
And because it takes five
members to start a club...

483
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,116
Unfortunately...

484
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,451
A cat doesn't count as a club member.

485
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,963
But chimera is my servant,
just like dekomori.

486
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,209
That's right. Just like I, dekomori.

487
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Don't admit that!

488
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,593
Got a minute?

489
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,632
Wh-what is it?

490
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:37,473
I've been thinking of joining your club.
I just turned in my application!

491
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,566
Far-east magical napping society
summer thereof

492
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,972
wh-what's this?!

493
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,441
Hey. It seems the dark flame master
has been summoned.

494
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:51,111
That's the saturnus summoning circle for you.
Such power. It will beckon others upon others.

495
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,525
Now look here...

496
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,991
What is this?! What did
you draw on the floor?

497
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,375
How can you not know what
a summoning circle is? Are you an idiot?

498
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:06,005
I know what it is. I'm asking
why there's one on the floor.

499
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,879
I told you in class. We're
holding a witches' sabbath.

500
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,178
Correct! And we have prepared a sacrifice.

501
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,296
Heh heh heh!

502
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,590
Nepenthes plants... so delicious...

503
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,802
Look, stop bringing that cat to school!

504
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,351
This club was formed to find
the invisible boundary line.

505
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,394
Chimera is required.

506
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:29,816
Master, let's hurry and replace this victim
with a newly summoned subject!

507
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,154
Very well.

508
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,909
In the name of wicked lord
shingan, I summon thee.

509
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,866
Thy name is murderer of the darkness.

510
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:43,038
Your blood, flesh, and
bones, all without form.

511
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,830
Whoa!

512
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,838
Huh?

513
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,046
We're just getting started.

514
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,165
You even made it light up?!

515
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:54,086
Master, that was just the right angle.
Do it again.

516
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,348
Go master! You're so cool!

517
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,467
You wanna try it out?

518
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,435
Yes, I do! I, dekomori, will try it!

519
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,183
Dark creature of twilight,
he reddened from the flow of blood...

520
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,694
I bestow upon thee a fitting end!

521
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,442
Drag slay!

522
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:21,871
The heck is this?

523
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,159
Sun weak wheat flour

524
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:22,872
sun weak wheat flour wait,
what are you doing?!

525
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,116
Wait, what are you doing?!

526
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,541
Hello there.

527
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,035
N-nibutani!

528
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,047
What's this?

529
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,831
I-I-it's nothing!

530
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,415
Ahn!

531
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:37,171
Could this be a summoning circle?
So, you really are studying magic?

532
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,093
Give it back! Give it back!

533
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,634
Give it back!

534
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,761
Baaarf!

535
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,763
The heck are you doing?

536
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,855
Thank you for the explanation.

537
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,100
How long have you been there?!

538
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:54,400
I searched diligently, but unfortunately, I found
nothing regarding the invisible boundary line.

539
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,023
What I did find is this one volume.

540
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,834
Melon gal!
What I did find is this one volume.

541
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,870
You've been poisoned by
this human world, eh?

542
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,039
I'm very sorry... huh?

543
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,083
Wait, I'm not the one at fault here!

544
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,837
You are. Dark flame master,
you mustn't look at such things.

545
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,084
What?

546
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,556
Seriously! Where is it?!

547
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,600
Hey, what are you doing?!

548
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,810
Do not open where could it be?
Huh?

549
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,852
What's this? Is it in here?

550
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,859
H-h-h-hey!

551
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,144
Don't open that!

552
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,821
Oww...

553
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:37,939
Where is it?

554
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,525
Huh? Where's what?

555
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,822
The mabinogion that idiot had.

556
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,660
Why?

557
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,744
Just tell me!

558
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,613
Uh... I think it's...

559
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,328
Oh, here it is. This thing is pretty heavy.

560
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,961
Wh-what?

561
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Huh?

562
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:02,844
"I've lost my memories, but I am a true magician,
one who has lived in this world for 500 years."

563
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,552
"These are my notes, those of one
who commands the spirits."

564
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,723
"My name is...

565
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:08,595
Morisummer."

566
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,941
Stop! I don't want to hear this!

567
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:18,109
"I believe everyone knows that in this world,
there are white worlds and dark worlds..."

568
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,720
Embarrassing! Embarrassing!
Embarrassing! Embarrassing! Embarrassing!

569
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,986
I went around the Internet,
deleting blog after blog...

570
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,114
I never thought someone would
have it all printed out.

571
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,792
Still, it's hard to believe
you wrote that kind of stuff.

572
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,628
Now listen! If you tell anyone,
I'll curse you to the grave!

573
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:37,966
S-such heat! It's over
2,500,000 degrees celsius!

574
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,086
Hang in there, dekomori.
Until I finish my chant!

575
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,183
Unfortunately, due to the cloudy weather,
the special point did not appear.

576
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,975
But since I've come all this way,
I shall retrieve the mabinogion.

577
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,643
Huh? Oh, yeah...

578
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,518
Come! Hurry and hand it over! Where is it?

579
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,814
There.

580
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,102
Wha-?!

581
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,820
It's burned completely to ash.

582
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,111
Too bad.

583
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,694
Now, the "eternal future record"
has been completely lost.

584
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,491
Wh-what have you done...?

585
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,035
How could you...?

586
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,579
Hey, you all right?

587
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,002
L, dekomori, treasured that!

588
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,841
Ummm...

589
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:18,881
Boo-hoo.

590
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:19,882
Boo-hoo?

591
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,592
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo...

592
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,971
Boo-hoo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo.
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo-hoo.

593
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,589
D-dekomori?

594
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,387
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

595
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:33,515
No need to worry! I thought this
might happen, so I set aside a copy!

596
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,650
Wha-?!

597
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,775
Yes, back then, I was...

598
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,193
The spirits are once again whispering.

599
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,492
Die, die! Die, past me!

600
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,323
I am the user of wicked lord shingan.

601
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,571
And so, after having recruited fake morisummer,
I am the user of wicked lord shingan.

602
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,369
And so, after having recruited fake morisummer,
society no. Zero, rikka takanashi!

603
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,116
Our club became more active.
Society no. Zero, rikka takanashi!

604
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:53,457
Our club became more active.

605
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,621
Our club became more active.
I am the servant of wicked lord shingan,

606
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,084
I am the servant of wicked lord shingan,

607
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,828
user of the Mjolnir hammer,

608
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,877
society no. Zero, sanae dekomori!

609
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:06,096
The... night siesta of horror!
Society no. Zero, kumin tsuyuri.

610
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,597
You fool child!

611
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,589
Th-that's...

612
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,590
White water!

613
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,602
Either suits me fine!

614
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:11,683
Now, drink! Drink it up!

615
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,725
Stop! Stop it!
Now, drink! Drink it up!

616
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,939
Good luck, deko-chan!

617
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:21,896
Look closely, fake morisummer! I will death
drive you to the horizon of limitless power!

618
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,692
Seven-colored Tome of
mabinogion, chapter 3, verse 1!

619
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:32,615
"When the whispers of the spirits,
the thoughts of light and water reach us,

620
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,538
the door to the white world shall open.

621
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:40,296
I have searched the world
these 400 years, so I know.

622
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,963
What this world needs most is..."

623
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,296
"Love!"

624
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,515
Stop! I don't want to hear that!

625
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,783
Deko-moron

626
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,788
deko-

627
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,861
[Looking for missing cat!!
Name: Dodomenh female

628
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,678
Issue an emergency alert.

629
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,183
Huh?

630
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,561
Hey...

631
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,137
Stop the background music!

632
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,148
Math?

633
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,810
Yeah. If she fails next semester,
she has to disband the club.

634
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,735
Oh, really? That's fine, isn't it? After
all, you have no real club activities.

635
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,152
That won't do!

636
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:36,037
We finally have a napping club.
We need to be more energetic!

637
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,749
Is she asleep?

638
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,792
Probably.

639
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,786
Go be energetic by yourself.

640
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,800
Morisummer-chan is pudgier
than she seems, isn't she?

641
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,462
What a fool.

642
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,393
I don't want to hear that
from the likes of you!

643
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,097
I command you in the name
of wicked lord shingan.

644
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:05,897
Fuse spirit, flesh, and bone into one, and
drive failing grades away from math exams.

645
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,904
Yes.

646
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,728
Now you're asking the gods?

647
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,399
I ask nothing. I'm commanding it
in the name of wicked lord shingan.

648
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,410
Yes!

649
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,533
Cut that out! You'll be cursed!

650
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,493
It'll be all right, rikka-chan.

651
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:24,870
When you're stuck for the right answer,
use this. It's my beloved pencil!

652
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,037
I'll lend it to you.

653
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,209
Whoa!

654
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,586
Question 1: What is the angle of angle a?

655
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,431
Four! The answer is...

656
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,727
Three!

657
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,429
Please don't let rikka-chan
get a failing grade.

658
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,226
These guys are hopeless.

659
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,767
Well, here goes!

660
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,608
Mjolnir accelerator!

661
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,980
Here's an explanation!

662
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,200
The Mjolnir accelerator focuses a magical
infusion into the nerves of the lower body,

663
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,116
making motor performance 3.88
times greater than normal

664
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,286
and allowing for high-speed movement. Yes!

665
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:08,793
Such accelerating force...
Here goes! To the speed of sound!

666
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,253
"She's gonna crash!" Is
what I'll make you think...

667
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,251
Then stop in the Nick of time!

668
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,262
That's enough.

669
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,713
Hurry up and get busy.

670
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:21,059
Anyway, why did I have to get
roped into this as well?

671
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,644
Nana-chan said all the
members had to do it.

672
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,727
I don't recall becoming a "member."

673
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,902
Uh... but you applied...

674
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,394
Ow.

675
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,273
I was just trying to get
close to that brat.

676
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,570
I'm a member of the cheerleading club.

677
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,739
Sorry, my hand slipped.

678
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,536
Ooh!

679
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,705
This is... Genesis! The old versus the new?

680
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,296
What foolishness are you on about?
Just put the hose down already!

681
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,129
I cannot comply!

682
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,922
Leave it to me, dekomori.
I'll lend you my strength.

683
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,214
Oh, master!

684
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,342
Evil eye shoot!

685
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,553
Such power... it courses through me!

686
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,473
May the hose be with you!

687
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,971
Move, move! Move!

688
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,648
I'll ask one more time: Do
you truly intend to study?

689
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,072
Of course.

690
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,732
Just so we're clear,
you need high t-scores at our school,

691
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,362
so if you want to get an "average" grade, you'd
better be ready for some serious studying.

692
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,987
I am prepared.

693
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,989
All right, then I'll teach you.

694
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,037
First, let's start with a basic problem.

695
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:31,629
"Find the probability that the sum of
two dice, when rolled, will be 3."

696
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,337
Can you do that?

697
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,456
No problem.

698
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:38,588
Still... this place is as messy as always.
If you cleaned up a little...

699
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,389
I don't get it.

700
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:46,637
I thought I'd understand if I knew how the person
tossing the dice felt, so I tried imagining it.

701
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,766
But it's more than I can do.
I don't know what this person is thinking!

702
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,402
In other words, that's the
extent of your ability?

703
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,317
No. I have yet to give this my all.

704
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,844
That's what you'd like to say, isn't it?

705
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,326
Then it can't be helped.
Let's try more from the beginning...

706
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,659
We're going to do all the ones from there?

707
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,584
We start from one you understand and then go
through them in order. That's how we do it.

708
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,206
Let's see here...

709
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,672
Who's there?

710
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,709
No one's there.

711
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,717
Someone was!

712
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,970
Yuta, look out!

713
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,920
I'm not falling for it.

714
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,805
Sometimes, yuta, the magic
imbued in the number 8-

715
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,177
I'm not falling for that, either.

716
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,188
Damn!

717
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,479
You just said "damn," didn't you?!

718
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,442
Sit!

719
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,810
You said you're serious about this, right?

720
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:36,937
I am.

721
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,947
You said, "I'll try hard,
so please teach me," right?

722
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,483
I did.

723
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:46,822
But... I'm no good at math.
I have no idea what they're thinking.

724
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,242
Anyway, even if you do know the probability
of the dice's outcome, how is that useful?

725
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,614
Don't suddenly make a valid point!

726
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,872
I just don't get it!

727
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,675
Ooh!

728
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,466
Yuta, your code is cool!

729
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,338
Huh? "Cool"?

730
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,051
It's pretty normal...

731
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,299
E-mail address
it's pretty normal...

732
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,392
E-mail address oh, no!

733
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:08,805
E-mail address

734
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,269
it hasn't changed since middle school.

735
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,764
Divine exseed Freya magna!

736
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,481
Stop that! Don't say it out loud!

737
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,022
I'll change it right now. Hang on a minute.

738
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:17,688
No.

739
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:18,193
Address book rikka takanashi

740
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,939
address book rikka takanashi mine
is the normal one. I'll change it.

741
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,188
Address book rikka takanashi

742
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,199
I've got it. Yuta, assign my code!

743
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,200
What?

744
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,411
I'm sure you'll come up
with something good.

745
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,452
No, uh, I think it's plenty good as-is.

746
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,992
Then I'll use your code.

747
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,004
Don't do that!

748
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,000
Wait, can you just suddenly change it?

749
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,168
Why not?

750
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:43,842
I mean, if you change it, you have to tell
your middle school friends and your family...

751
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,966
No problem. I'll just inform
the priestess and dekomori.

752
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,644
Oh, really?

753
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:54,643
They are the only beings cognizant
of my presence in this dimension.

754
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:08,494
But if you decide on a code for me,
I'll tell you, nibutani, and kumin, too.

755
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:14,871
Come here a minute.

756
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,710
Huh? But the heartleaf tea...

757
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,631
I'll do my best to teach you
right up to the day of the test.

758
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,796
So you do your best and study.

759
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,137
Yuta...

760
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,175
This is your club, right?

761
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,725
Yeah.

762
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:36,689
If you get an above-average score, I'll think
of a protocol code I'm sure you'll like.

763
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,066
Okay!

764
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,150
Oh, no.

765
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,815
I'd neglected my own studies.

766
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,324
No good, huh?

767
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,869
You all did poorly this time.

768
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,534
The average score was a 50.

769
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,664
What?!

770
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:58,832
Study harder.

771
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,460
Such power!

772
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,588
Just walk once in a while.

773
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,048
Oh! That's right, I forgot!

774
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,392
Yuta, give me my protocol code!

775
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,055
Huh?

776
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,269
What are you talking about?

777
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,065
I'm kidding. I've thought of one!

778
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,022
This is special, just for today...

779
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,990
Huh...?

780
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,945
O user of wicked lord shingan!

781
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,614
In acknowledgment of
your efforts and deeds,

782
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:38,327
I, dark flame master, have compiled the dark
powers and distilled for you a fitting code.

783
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,874
You would do well to carve
it into your breast.

784
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:45,216
Protocol code... engrave!

785
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,200
Received mail yuta
togashi subj: Carve it!

786
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,387
"Black raison d'étre"?

787
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,680
It means one's dark reason for existing.
It is a fitting code for you, yes?

788
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,524
How cool... it's so cool, yuta!

789
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,355
Of course.

790
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,274
How long am I gonna keep this up?

791
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,194
Hey! Hang on a...

792
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,446
Thank you

793
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,378
I think some stuff happened
after that, but...

794
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,846
Dark limited unknown shield! Engage!

795
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,971
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed little by little
due to the bureau's attacks. Did you say something, phonysummer?!

796
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,434
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed little by
little due to the bureau's attacks. Huh?! No, I didn't!

797
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,598
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed
little by little due to the bureau's attacks. Really?

798
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,767
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed little by little due to the
bureau's attacks. I believe I heard you and skinhead here say something about me!

799
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,106
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed little by little
due to the bureau's attacks. Who are you calling "skinhead"?!

800
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,212
With summer here, my wicked lord shingan changed
little by little due to the bureau's attacks.

801
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,897
You're suddenly motion sick?

802
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,271
That's why I said she's
an elementary schooler.

803
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,273
Sh..shut up-

804
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,868
just look outside. At the far-off greenery.

805
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,533
Shut... up.

806
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:02,293
At a time like this, I'll look over the words of
the mabinogion and drive off the evil spirits.

807
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:03,922
"The heart-"

808
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,626
it won't be much longer.

809
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,347
Hey.

810
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,349
Rikka?

811
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,978
What?

812
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,477
Have some kind of reaction!

813
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,316
You look amazing in that bikini!

814
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,031
Hey, what's with your outfit?

815
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,774
Even your swimsuit is all white?

816
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,072
Well, this is all I had.

817
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,991
Does it suit me?

818
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,960
It seems that the kraken
lurks in these waters!

819
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:49,207
Now is the time for us to test the power
of these marine-use magical garments!

820
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,424
Feast your eyes on this!

821
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:59,385
With those magic garments,
one can move 3.88 times faster in water.

822
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,056
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

823
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,019
3.88 times faster.

824
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,523
All right, then. Hurry up and go.

825
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,897
I'l remember this!

826
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,895
True, that's pretty fast.

827
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,448
Thanks for the food.

828
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,992
Is there cheese in this?!

829
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,323
Deko-chan, you don't like cheese, either?

830
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:26,748
Who could eat something
that smells like rotten dishrags?

831
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:31,625
It's made of milk! Milk is rotten.
It's the worst!

832
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,635
Eat it.

833
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,388
Eat it.

834
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,379
B-but milk...

835
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,593
Eat it.

836
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,136
Yes, ma'am.

837
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:40,974
Whoa!

838
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,434
You're doing great, deko-chan!

839
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,726
What's the passphrase?

840
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,894
Huh?

841
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,435
"Wicked lord shingan is most powerful."

842
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,607
Wrong.

843
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,901
It's wrong?

844
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,242
It seems you've suffered damage from
the priestess' psychological attack.

845
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,153
You are not yourself, yuta.

846
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,326
You thought as much, did you?

847
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,744
Rest easy. I am the dark
flame master of old.

848
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,004
You okay?

849
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,341
Don't want to go look for the
invisible boundary line?

850
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,021
Really?

851
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,860
Why would I lie?

852
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:38,779
W-well, mama and my sister,
and grandpa and grandma did.

853
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,739
But this is me, right?

854
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,121
Yuta... my sis-

855
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:49,202
the priestess surely has her guard up.
Breaking free won't be easy.

856
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,669
So, wanna give up?

857
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:54,926
When shall we go?

858
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,005
N-now!

859
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,298
Now?

860
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,304
Yup. Now.

861
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,605
What do you think you're doing?

862
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,819
Beats me. I don't really know, myself.

863
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,814
Ar! That was kinda cool!

864
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,611
Look, you just be quiet.

865
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,861
Unbelievable. Turns out
you really are dangerous.

866
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,164
Yutal

867
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,874
Rikkal

868
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,261
come on!

869
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,252
Come on, rikka!

870
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,008
Jump!

871
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,491
Avalon smasher!

872
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,536
How long do you plan to
keep up this nonsense?

873
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,134
Is it fun?

874
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,968
Is it fun to keep acting this
way, like a selfish child?

875
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,971
Gun tinkle!

876
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,565
Do you hate mama?

877
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,323
No.

878
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,406
You want to make grandma
and grandpa unhappy?!

879
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:50,747
No!

880
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:55,245
You get it, right? You know what can't be
changed! When there's nothing you can do!

881
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,920
What'll it take to satisfy you?
Nothing can be done, right?

882
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,463
Evil eye.

883
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,138
You idiot!

884
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,567
Yutal

885
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,702
jeez. I barely made it!

886
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,415
Why...?

887
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,996
That's what I'd like to ask.
Where are you going?

888
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:41,253
The bureau's strength is amplified in
this region. The field is too powerful.

889
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,802
I'm retreating.

890
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,260
So, you're going home?

891
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,726
Yuta...

892
00:53:55,816 --> 00:54:00,310
Where did you acquire the dark flame power?

893
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,861
Look, that's not even really...

894
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,952
I want to forget!

895
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,120
What is it? The bureau's interference?

896
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,705
No.

897
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,245
Now, look-

898
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,336
our eyes met.

899
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,375
Huh?

900
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:38,431
This has bound us in a rather strong pact,
dark flame master.

901
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:39,769
Suit yourself.

902
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,688
Be enveloped in the flames of darkness-

903
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,695
stop that!

904
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,487
It's gotten so late...

905
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,449
Yuta! I can't get inside.

906
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,702
The entry code has changed.

907
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,955
You mean you forgot to bring your key!

908
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,711
Jeez. Guess it can't be helped...

909
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,090
Thank you very much.

910
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,385
You're really okay with this?

911
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:21,974
Since seeing you eat these at school,
I've been intrigued by their construction.

912
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,816
So, you purge this here...
Extricating the outer skin.

913
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,734
Just grab both sides and pull.

914
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,776
Ooh!

915
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,149
How very cool.

916
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,275
That's cool?

917
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,535
Mmm!

918
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,828
It's delicious.

919
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,494
I bet toka-San would be
mad about this, huh?

920
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,421
Here. We have chicken nuggets, too.

921
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,089
A queer taste.

922
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,462
What does that mean?

923
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,596
What flavor is yours?

924
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:54,931
You wanna try?

925
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:55,299
Uh-huh. You wanna try?

926
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,769
Here.

927
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,145
Was it spicy?

928
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,184
Yuta!

929
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,557
Sorry 'bout that.

930
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,144
Replenishment complete.

931
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,484
Okay. Well, let's go back.

932
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Yuta.

933
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,744
I don't want to.

934
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,047
Huh?!

935
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,876
I will bathe in the moonlight.

936
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,545
Whoa... hey!

937
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,887
Yuta, is this Mjolnir hammer?

938
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,219
You have an active imagination, don't you?

939
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,937
Come on, it's late.

940
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,727
You can sleep in this room.
Brush your teeth and-

941
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,401
it smells like you.

942
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,524
S-stop that!

943
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,949
Why?

944
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,733
It smells like you...

945
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,412
Stop! It's kinda embarrassing!

946
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,161
Okay, here go the lights.

947
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,374
Night is when wicked lord
shingan comes alive-

948
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,381
just sleep.

949
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:24,555
My heart races. They may have drawn closer.
I need to stay alert.

950
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,851
Now look...

951
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,776
I'm turning it off.

952
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,490
My heart races.

953
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,484
You'll feel better if you sleep.

954
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,656
My heart beats fast.

955
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,904
That's the same thing.

956
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,030
My heart is pounding!

957
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,577
Are you a commercial for a theme park?

958
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,949
I'll blow up!

959
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:44,996
Why would you?!

960
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,288
I don't know!

961
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,000
U-uh... um...

962
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,544
Look, just go to bed.

963
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,255
Wait!

964
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:56,887
Now look-!

965
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,882
Don't go.

966
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,728
Yuta, close your eyes.

967
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,437
Huh?!

968
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:10,310
Just a little... just a little, please.

969
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,177
What is this?

970
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,882
A fragment of absolutely powerful magic.
Proof of our earlier pact.

971
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,895
Please put it somewhere
where it doesn't stand out so much.

972
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:51,441
It's most effective here.
It doubles the powers of darkness.

973
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,395
You can release the dark buster,
even more powerful than the dark flame.

974
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Time for bed.

975
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,619
My heart pounds!

976
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,124
This feeling...

977
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,552
Who's there?!

978
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,501
Yuta.

979
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,423
Kumin...

980
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,418
Kumin?

981
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,630
Oh! Rikka-chan!

982
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,801
You okay? Did the spatial paradox get you?

983
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:07,851
Paradox? I was just napping
since it's nice out.

984
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:09,647
No.

985
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:15,272
It's all because of the spatial paradox
caused by an evil singularity.

986
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,396
Yuta... and myself...

987
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,280
Something must be done.

988
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,411
Rikka, you here?

989
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,539
Do you realize what time it is?

990
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,040
Yuta...

991
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,048
What?

992
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,676
I'm sorry.

993
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:42,177
What, you called me here for that?

994
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:43,712
Huh?

995
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,217
I will defeat you!

996
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,433
Wha-?

997
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,383
Ow-!

998
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:51,137
Indeed, I can see it! The singularity!

999
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,729
What are you talking about?!

1000
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:58,398
Yuta, the bureau has made it such that an
evil singularity has taken root within you!

1001
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,986
I shall remove it!

1002
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,990
Master!

1003
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,950
Be destroyed, real. B-blow up, synapses.

1004
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,410
Vanishment this world!

1005
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Huh?

1006
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,287
Uh... huh?

1007
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,711
Master! This calls for that!

1008
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:17,420
Dekomori!

1009
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,424
Master!

1010
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,918
How's this?! Can you tell us apart?

1011
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,043
I am rikka.

1012
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,545
L, dekomori, am dekomori.

1013
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:26,554
Which is rikka?

1014
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,764
Which is the master, yes?

1015
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:33,887
Hmph.

1016
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:34,899
That was plain as day.

1017
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,027
What's the point if your
body double has to save you?

1018
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,947
Oh, no! He has a point, yes?!

1019
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,943
Jeez, what were you thinking?

1020
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,952
I can't believe I worried about you.

1021
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,367
You okay?

1022
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,125
Here.

1023
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:03,594
What's with you?

1024
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,323
Love?

1025
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,074
Yeah.

1026
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:40,329
Can't you tell? You're in
love with togashi-kun.

1027
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:43,882
It's so obvious!

1028
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,010
Hah!

1029
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,559
T..takanashi-San, are you okay?

1030
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,887
Wicked lord shingan is the strongest.

1031
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:00,607
I've already formed the
ultimate pact with yuta.

1032
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,853
There is no need for the
pact to become one of love.

1033
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,026
But your heart pounds
whenever you're with togashi-kun, right?

1034
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:12,369
Don't you imagine it when you go home?
The two of you holding hands,

1035
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,195
or kissing...

1036
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,793
B-but, wicked lord shingan's power is...

1037
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,502
Ah, but...

1038
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:27,251
I don't get how your chunibyo delusions
can overlap with real-world love...

1039
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,968
Whoa! Hey!

1040
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,013
Ow, ow!

1041
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,723
Schwarz shield!

1042
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,223
This renders all psychological
attacks ineffective!

1043
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,350
What do you think of me?

1044
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,317
Esi I reir er sseac ieee
== == sorte see caries ee

1045
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,350
why do I have to do this?

1046
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,903
Listen up. When it's just
the two of you, say this:

1047
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,731
"What do you think of me?"

1048
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,827
Y-y... yuta!

1049
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,206
Huh?

1050
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,499
What do you...

1051
01:03:59,502 --> 01:03:59,991
Hm?

1052
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,745
What do you think of my
wicked lord shingan?

1053
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:05,466
Huh?

1054
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,167
Wicked lord shingan is
me, through and through.

1055
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,513
In times like this, I, that is,
wicked lord shingan, is...

1056
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,972
What are you babbling about?

1057
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:15,802
The two of us, alone in the library. When he reached for the book, I knew. After class, having been asked by the teacher
to arrange the books... when his face drew close to mine... it's my chance. It wasn't accidental... 1 think he, too...

1058
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,640
The two of us, alone in the library. When he reached for the book, j khew. After class, having been asked by the teacher to arrange the books... when
his face drew close to mine... it's my chance. It wash't accidental... 1 think he, t0o0... this time, you don't have to say anything. Just do this.

1059
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,180
1 raised my head ahd... our eyes met. This time,
you don't have to say anything. Just do this.

1060
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,915
And gently, he... this time, you don't
have to say anything. Just do this.

1061
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,055

1069
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,901

01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:37,203
Jeez. What the heck?

1072
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:41,951
Yes. Then, when his face gets close...

1073
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:42,958
You okay?

1074
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,627
Look up right away!

1075
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,628

ow... what are you doing?!

1077
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,429
Yuta. You were wide open.

1078
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,679
Whoa. This is higher than I'd imagined.

1079
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:05,439

01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,652

1081
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,162
Dammit!

1082
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,541
Hang on!

01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,559
Easy now... easy.

1086
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,270
You can let go now.

1087
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,656
Yuta...

1088
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,117
Yuta! Yuta, yuta!

1089
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,330
Rikka...

1090
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,701
I... I was...

1091
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,357
Far-east magical napping society
“summer thereof

1092
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,900
master!

1093
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:35,693
Whoa! I never thought that, with the darkness,
we'd be visited by the night of the demon!

1094
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,233
Master?

1095
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,512
Master?

1096
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,179
Wh-what is it, master?

1097
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,009
Gasp!

1098
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,509
Could it be master cares for me, dekomori?

1099
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:08,855
Uh...

1100
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,394
Master, you mustn't!

1101
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,437
I am your servant.

1102
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,607
It isn't right to harbor such feelings!

1103
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:23,328
Still, I know that the more something is
forbidden, the more it is hungered for!

1104
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,913
Master?

1105
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,166
Yuta and I embraced.

1106
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,049
What?

1107
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,547
I like yuta.

1108
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,086
Master?

1109
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:41,507
Gasp!

1110
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,802
Could you be a fake master?

1111
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,768
First a fake morisummer,
now a fake master?!

1112
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,558
It's me.

1113
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,974
Meaning, in other words...

1114
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:57,403
The master is taken with dark flame master?

1115
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,607
I-I-in love?

1116
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:09,537
Master! I, dekomori,
have someplace to go, so I shall leave.

1117
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:10,913
Dekomori...

1118
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
I'll stop this!

1119
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:17,174
As a servant, I'll find he who
stole your heart, and to the darkness-

1120
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,250
what should I do?

1121
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:35,226
You say that wicked lord shingan has protected
you thus far thanks to dark flame master.

1122
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,361
Yes...

1123
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:42,028
I'm sure such strong emotion has been
conveyed to dark flame master, too.

1124
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,320
I don't know...

1125
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,703
It's been a little over two
years that I've served you.

1126
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:50,915
Your servant sees right
through you, master!

1127
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,249
Dekomori...

1128
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,453
There's no need to worry.

1129
01:08:55,715 --> 01:09:00,505
Wicked lord shingan is the strongest.
I'm sure everything will go well.

1130
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,794
Right.

1131
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:27,244
By our covenant, hear now my command.
By our covenant, hear now my command.

1132
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,113
By our covenant, hear now my command.

1133
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,455
What's that?

1134
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,832
A magic stone. To Grant my wish.
Dekomori gave it to me.

1135
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:36,873
Wish?

1136
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,707
I can't say the specifics of my wish!

1137
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,592
Uh, no one asked.

1138
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:47,766
Hm?

1139
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:50,387
You dropped it.

1140
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,181
Whoa. It's warm.

1141
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:56,223
A strong wish makes the magic stone
give off heat. Meaning-

1142
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,068
no!

1143
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,895
Ow...

1144
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,872
Things can't keep going like this, huh?

1145
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,004
So, look...

1146
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:27,514
So, look!

1147
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,050
Schwarz zx prototype Mark il!

1148
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,801
Quit rattling off its full name!

1149
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:35,939
Hey!

1150
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,229
What is it?

1151
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,730
The lights...

1152
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,484
The lights are dancing.

1153
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,293
Rikka...

1154
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,508
I like you, yuta.

1155
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,511
Huh?!

1156
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,385
Yuta, I...

1157
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,387
I like you.

1158
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,191
W-wait! I should go first, right?!

1159
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,905
No. By wicked lord shingan,
it was decided that I would go first.

1160
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,446
But I'm dark flame master, aren't 1?

1161
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,612
Wicked lord shingan is the strongest.

1162
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,168
Wha...

1163
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,003
Nope, I won't have it.

1164
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,045
I've thought about it,
so I'm going to say it.

1165
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,344
Okay...

1166
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:54,303
You who are enveloped in the flames of darkness:
Become the love of dark flame master by...

1167
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,186
Forget it. At any rate-

1168
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,190
keep going.

1169
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:02,561
Yuta.

1170
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,772
Okay.

1171
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,785
You who are enveloped in
the flames of darkness:

1172
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:15,536
Become the love of dark flame master
by entering into this pact.

1173
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,582
Okay.

1174
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,004
Aren't you supposed to be in my arms?

1175
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,011
You embarrassed?

1176
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,015
Yes.

1177
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,216
How about holding hands?

1178
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,804
Just my pinky.

1179
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,148
Fine, pinkies then.

1180
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,357
Yeah.

1181
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,369
Yes?

1182
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,369
M-m... 'Morning!

1183
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,248
Nibutani told me to
change how I speak, too.

1184
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,496
She did?

1185
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,964
Yes, she did, yuta-kun.

1186
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,505
May I be of assistance?

1187
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,423
What are you, a maid?

1188
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:14,887
What can I do for you?

1189
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,222
You're a Princess now?

1190
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,011
What, pray?

1191
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,384
Enough already!

1192
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:20,677
What?

1193
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,017
That sounds the most natural.

1194
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,310
It makes me embarrassed.

1195
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,808
Hold it.

1196
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,189
'Morning.

1197
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,686
Do not "morning" me!

1198
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:35,442
Today at last, I shall release the demon
that has captured the master's heart!

1199
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:39,328
Be destroyed, real! Blow up, synapses!

1200
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,247
Vanishment this world!

1201
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,920
Master!

1202
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,878
Open your eyes!

1203
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,585
I'm over this.

1204
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,764
Master...

1205
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,181
Master!

1206
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,893
There, there.

1207
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,981
It's none of your business.

1208
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:17,744
Still...

1209
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,785
This was when dark flame master awakened.

1210
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,745
Tails, huh?

1211
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,294
Guess it can't be helped.

1212
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:40,431
Rikka!

1213
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:42,519
Yuta?

1214
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,688
I have to water them.

1215
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,136
Yutal

1216
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,516
I am not yutal

1217
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,487
Yutal

1218
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,736
rikka takanashi...

1219
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,735
Rather, wicked lord shingan!

1220
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,829
There's something I wish to show you.

1221
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,326
Yuta...

1222
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:01,004
Make... a pact with me!

1223
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,555
Who's there?!

1224
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,765
You a thief?

1225
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,387
What're you doin', dammit?!

1226
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:06,884
Oh, no!

1227
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,978
Dear, get the gun! Bring my hunting rifle!

1228
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,221
Rikka, come on!

1229
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,434
But...

1230
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:13,228
Will you return to mundane reality?

1231
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:17,153
Or do you not wish to change
reality together with me?!

1232
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,858
Yuta.

1233
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,363
Dear!

1234
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,371
Rikkal

1235
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,366

1237
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,042
Rikkal

1238
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,729
The lights...

1239
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,514
Pretty, aren't they?

1240
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,402
But they're just lights from ships.

1241
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,900
Ordinary lights.

1242
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,578
Get off.

1243
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,958
This is the power of darkness:

1244
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,291
Be destroyed, real.

1245
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,041
Blow up, synapses.

1246
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:27,261
Vanishment... this world!

1247
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:41,861
Yutal

1248
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:48,619
it's the invisible boundary line.
That light is watching you.

1249
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,365
You should share your thoughts...

1250
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:57,378
The thoughts you've wanted
so long to express.

1251
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,792
Goodbye.

1252
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,177
Goodbye, papa!

1253
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,777
Rikka

1254
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,652
goodbye!

1255
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,173
Yutal

1256
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:52,185
crap! Let's run!

1257
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,010
Neighborhood watch on patrol you two
on the bike, pull over immediately!

1258
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,498
You two on the bike, pull over immediately!

1259
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,802
I repeat, pull over immediately!

1260
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:33,558
And now, dark flame master
is off fighting in the final battle.

1261
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:39,806
The bureau's threat still remains despite
finding the invisible boundary line.

1262
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:42,568
Master!

1263
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,691
Being that I am wicked lord shingan,
this was my battle to begin with.

1264
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,732
I can't leave everything to yuta.

1265
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:56,163
Even so, dark flame master
asked you to leave it to him.

1266
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,033
He wants you to wait for him.

1267
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,243
Yuta...

1268
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,088
Has togashi-kun gotten back yet?

1269
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,382
No, not yet, morisummer-chan.

1270
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,843
Why are you dressed like that?!

1271
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,216
I had drama club rehearsal.

1272
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,425
He said he'd call if he had trouble...

1273
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:20,851
What could a fake like you
do in the final battle?

1274
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:24,224
I'm good at negotiations, you know!

1275
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:28,604
I doubt you would in that getup.

1276
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,615
Shut it.

1277
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:35,160
But, morisummer-chan, you always come here
in your drama club costumes.

1278
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:39,123
I don't feel like changing.
Besides, it's just you guys here.

1279
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:44,538
Oh, I totally thought it was
to make deko-chan happy.

1280
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,005
What?! Why would I do this
for that middle school-

1281
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:49,591
take this!

1282
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,334
Ow!

1283
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:55,594
I'm not in middle school anymore! This spring,
I'll be a high schooler just like you!

1284
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:59,185
But I'm older than you, so
get off your high horse!

1285
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,434
What are you doing?! Mjolnir hammer!

1286
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,898
I hope everything goes well for
togashi-kun. Ow! That hurts! Why, you...!

1287
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:04,981
Yeah.
Ow! That hurts! Why, you...!

1288
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,100
Yeah. Behave yourself!

1289
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:06,850
Behave yourself!

1290
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:07,897
Mjolnir tornado!

1291
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,359
I kept you waiting, huh?

1292
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,774
Yutal

1293
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,198
sorry, my phone died.

1294
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,574
How'd it go?

1295
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,997
You better get ready,

1296
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,084
'cause you'll be living on
your own starting tomorrow.

1297
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:27,006
Yutal

1298
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,289
whoa! Hey, come on. Yutal

1299
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,381
yuta, thank you!

1300
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,125
Yuta! Yuta, yuta!

1301
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,876
Settle down now.
Yuta! Yuta, yuta!

1302
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,464
I knew dark flame master was the strongest!

1303
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,260
Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,132
You're the strongest!

1305
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:47,274
Rikka's mother had to move away
for two years due to job training.

1306
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,982
So I went to see rikka's grandfather, who
didn't care that I'd take care of rikka,

1307
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:54,402
and ask him to let her live on her own.

1308
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:59,203
Rikka's grandfather just wouldn't budge.

1309
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:07,498
But rikka's mom and toka, who suddenly appeared,
supported me, and he reluctantly agreed.

1310
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,801
At any rate, this sure is a lot of stuff.

1311
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,720
All of it is important.

1312
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:24,645
If your grandfather saw all these boxes, he might
have let you live on your own without me asking.

1313
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:26,771
Yuta?

1314
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:27,775
Yeah?

1315
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,433
What did my mom say?

1316
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,861
She said she'll come over to sit down
and have a talk next time...

1317
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:36,699
And that once she's done with training, she
wants to live with you for real this time.

1318
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,195
Really?

1319
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,203
Yeah.

1320
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,705
It's snowing.

1321
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,669
But it's almost April.

1322
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,344
Snow?

1323
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,765
Yes.

1324
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,061
"Rikka" means "snow."

1325
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:11,226
The winter I was pregnant
with her, it snowed so much.

1326
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:18,157
Did you know that no two
snow crystals are identical?

1327
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:22,779
They're unique and
absolutely irreplaceable.

1328
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:28,288
That's why we named our daughter rikka.

1329
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,591
I like snow.

1330
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,677
I used to hate the cold.

1331
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,012
But now...

1332
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:42,808
I love it.

1333
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,308
We'll start moving things now.

1334
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,943
Oh, but...

1335
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,899
Yutal

1336
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,397
yes. Yes...

1337
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,239
What? Really?!

1338
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,826
Yeah, grandma just told me.

1339
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:09,497
It seems grandpa terminated the lease
and called the movers a while back.

1340
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,458
No way...

1341
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:15,877
Grandma just called to cancel,
but I guess it was too late.

1342
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,420
What can we do?

1343
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:20,548
She finally got permission to live alone.

1344
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:24,890
If her stuff is delivered here,
it could rehash the issue.

1345
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,300
That's true.

1346
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,643
Oh, grandpa is here. I'm hanging up.

1347
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,763
Wait, hello? Are you there, toka-San?

1348
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,939
Yutal

1349
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,688
I've got no choice!

1350
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,194
So it's back to this again.

1351
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,187
Togashi

1352
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:43,738
this déja vu... there's a chance
that the bureau is controlling our memory.

1353
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,411
It's reality, not déja vu.

1354
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,411
Then we went back in time...

1355
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:51,419
Wrong!

1356
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,452
You can't use your room anymore.

1357
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,462
Jeez. What are we going to do?

1358
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:59,170
The new semester's about to start, too.

1359
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,088
Heilichwasser.

1360
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,674
This isn't the time for that!

1361
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,843
Yuta, that hurts!

1362
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,935
You might not have a place to live.

1363
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,553
Don't worry.

1364
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:17,151
In the meantime, I'll just move my base of
operations here until I decide on a new location.

1365
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,111
How can you have the gall to say that?

1366
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,652
I mean, that won't work!

1367
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,612
How come?

1368
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:33,875
What's this?

1369
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:38,339
Mom, kuzuha, and yumeha
started living in Jakarta this spring.

1370
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,999
Kuzuha and everyone?

1371
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:42,925
What?!

1372
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,169
Whoa!

1373
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,384
They're living overseas?

1374
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,096
Yeah.

1375
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,100
Really?

1376
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,352
Yes!

1377
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,977
I see... so they're living over-

1378
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:53,515
what?!

1379
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:58,734
That means, if you live here,
it would just be the two of us living here.

1380
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,905
Oh, umm...

1381
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,990
I was joking earlier.

1382
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,609
Then what are you gonna do?

1383
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,202
Um, well...

1384
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,329
It fell off again.

1385
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:18,333
And so, rikka and I began
our new life together.

1386
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:35,141
Owaranai monogatari...
A tale with no ending...

1387
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:40,893
Himeta chikara, daichi o tomose
o hidden power, illuminate this earth

1388
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:57,827
Dare ni mo wakaranai, ano hi no samusa nante
no one can understand the cold of that day

1389

dare mo ga kakushiteru, keburu shikai no

1391
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:08,967

matter how much I cry out, the world remains oblivious

1392
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:14,310
dakaratte hikeru ka yo, toge no shibuki o kurete yaru even
so, how could I back down? I'll rain down a shower of thorns

1393
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:19,933
hikari wa dare yori mo hayai to, kanchigai o shita I
had the wrong idea, that light is faster than all

1394
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:25,654
yami wa kanarazu sono saki ni machikamaete iru tte
noni yet darkness will surely be there first, waiting

1395
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:29,070
konton o itadaita tabibito yo
o traveler who has embraced chaos

1396
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:32,278
owaranai kaze to umi

1397
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:35,201
bokura no hi ga kibou ni naru
our fires will become hope

1398
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:40,498
ishi o motsu koto ga, kodoku e no jokyoku demo
even if having volition is a prelude to solitude

1399
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:46,967
haiiro no oka ni tachi, tatakaitsuzukeru sa we
can stand atop that ashen hill and keep fighting

1400
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:51,964
shijin ga jounetsu o furuwaseta
the poets have incited passion

1401
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:57,095
sou... bokura mo "genijitsu" o warau
yes... we, too, ridicule "reality"

1402
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,772
Inside identity

1403
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,491
ibasho wa doko?
Where do I belong?

1404
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,204
Kanchigai ga haji da to ka

1405
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,923

1407
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,049

I don't get what "correctness" is

1408
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,924
futsuu ni nagareteku nichijou ni
these regular days that flow forth normally

1409
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,267
muri shite najimaseta
I've forced myself to grow used to them

1410
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,977
shizunjimatta koseitachi o
the individualities that drowned

1411
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,267
