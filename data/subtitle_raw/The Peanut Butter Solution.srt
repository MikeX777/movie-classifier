00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,172

sister, Susan Allison Baskin.

"The Wretch."

7
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,068
See the blue robe she's wearing?

8
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:35,620
Looks too big, eh?

9
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:39,344
Well it's Mom's and
she's gone away.

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,793
She's wearing it
because she knows

11
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:46,344
it really, really bugs me.

12
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,103
- I told you, she said I could.

13
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,310
- [Boy] But why?

14
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,172
It's too big for you anyway.

15
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,379
[sighing]

16
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:53,862
- I'm sorry but there's
nothing I can do about it.

17
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,482
Now give me your plate.

18
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,517
- I don't want any of that guck.

19
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,241
Your toast is burning.

20
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:00,793
- Oh God.

21
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,793
Come on, eat it Michael!

22
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,551
- No.

23
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:10,862
- It's fruit.

24
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,068
It's exactly what Mom
makes and you eat that.

25
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:12,724
- I don't want any.

26
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:14,517
- Come on.

27
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,620
Ugh.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,413
That does it, that
really does it.

29
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:20,689

[jazz piano music]

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,000

him, do you hear?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,034
I can't stand him.

33
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,241
Everything I do is wrong.

35
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,034
Dad, are you listening to me?

36
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,931
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I hear you, Suz.

37
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,000
I am just too tired for
all your squabbling today.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,689
I've been up all night!

39
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,551
It's not easy for him either.

40
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,724
With Mom gone,
don't forget that.

41
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,310
- What do you mean?

42
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,758
She's not dead, you now.

- Hi Superman, coming
to soccer practice?

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:19,793
- Hi, Connie.

48
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,724
- Gee, what's wrong with you?

49
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,137
- Nothing.

50
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,034
Well,

51
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:29,517
Suzie.

52
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,172
- Look, here you're
just a brother, right?

53
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,275
But on the soccer field,
you're a star, come on.

54
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:44,310
- Maybe.

55
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,241
Hey, did you hear the
fire engines last night?

56
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,620
- Are you kidding?

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,068
I was right in the
middle of the action.

58
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,000
[laughing]

59
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,724
Hi, Mr. Baskin.

60
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:59,137
Hi, Suzie, nice
morning for a ride.

61
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:00,586
- Hi, Connie.

62
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,482
- [Mr. Baskin] God,
it's the human flea.

63
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:07,448
Are you here for breakfast or
are you just wiggling through?

64
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,827
- [Connie] I'm just having
some of these delicious grapes,

65
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:09,896
if that's okay.

66
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,931
- What?

67
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:13,137
- I said, I'm just having some
of these delicious grapes,

68
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,034
if that's okay with you.

69
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:18,241
- Do I have a choice?

70
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,793
- [Michael] Connie was at
a fire last night, Dad.

71
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,310
- Yeah, it was fabulous.

72
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,517
All started about midnight.

73
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,724
Half the neighborhood was
there but I got the closest.

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,310
- Yeah, I'll bet.

75
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,758
- I was wiggling through
the fireman's legs,

76
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:31,000
the hoses spraying
up all around me.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,275
The guy's coming all
suffocated from the smoke,

78
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,206
coughing like this.

79
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,000
[mimicking coughing]

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,758
[giggling]

81
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,689
Boy, those flames.

82
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,862
You shoulda seen them.

83
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,275
- Where was it?

84
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,172
- This old spooky
house near school.

85
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,620
You now, the one that whino has
been sleeping in all winter.

86
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:51,551
- [Suzie] What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:56,000
[somber piano music]

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,379
- [Michael Voiceover] Oh boy,

89
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,000
the old spooky house.

90
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:00,241
Outside.

91
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,206
I saw one from yesterday.

92
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:06,551
One of the whinos camps there.

93
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,034
He was outside the bank.

94
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,482
He was begging

95
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,275
but nobody was
giving him anything.

96
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,482
It's funny how
little things you do

97
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:21,655
can change your whole life.

98
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,793
So I gave him some money,

99
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:32,172
all that I had.

100
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:39,344
- Shoot, soccer
practice, come on!

101
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:42,758
- Hey, hey, hey.

102
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,068
Play well, eh buddy.

103
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:48,793
- [Suzie] Comb your
hair, Michael.

104
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:49,310
- Yeah!

105
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,137
Hold on!

106
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,758
I wanna check and see if there
are any letters from Mom!

107
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:57,793
- [Connie] Hurry up!

108
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:06,275
- Again, nothing.

109
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:10,793
- Oops.

110
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,724
Hey, you little guys.

111
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,379
It's dangerous
around here for you.

112
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:16,724
Whoops.

113
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,655
Watch out, there's ants.

114
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:22,758
- [Michael] Ants?

115
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,275
There's no ants.

116
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,517
- There are!

117
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,310
- You're strange, Connie.

118
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,103
Was that true about the fire

119
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,586
or were you just
trying to scare us?

120
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:32,517
- [Connie] No, it's
true, I swear it!

121
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,517
[crow squawking]

122
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:37,931
See?

123
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,517
Now do you believe me?

124
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:40,931
- I wanna look inside.

125
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,689
- No, come on.

126
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:43,689
People died in there
just a few hours ago.

127
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,344
- Oh, gross.

128
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:52,241
Why do you have to
be such a slob?

129
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,931
How is this supposed
to be clean?

130
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,172
Supposed to be responsible.

131
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,172
Smell that.

132
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:56,620
- Ugh, God.

133
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,689
Go on, get that out of here.

134
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,344
God, Suz,

135
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:04,206
I can't concentrate with
you yap, yap, yapping away!

136
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,517
You're late for
school, go on, off.

137
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,862
Off with you.

138
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:07,379
- Thought I'd dress first.

139
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,586
- [Dad] Very funny.

140
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:12,655
- Oh, it's easy to be
funny in a madhouse.

141
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,620
You just be normal.

142
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,034
- [Dad] Hey, wish me
luck with the rabbit.

143
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,517
- Good luck.

144
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:17,724
- Thank you.

145
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,793
- Don't fight.

146
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:22,758
Gum out, please.

147
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,241
[children chattering]

148
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:29,482
Pick it up, don't drag it.

149
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,275
Pick up the books.

150
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,931
Jessica, stop running.

151
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:35,517
See me after school.

152
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,034
After school.

153
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,862
- Look at him.

154
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,448
Look at that way he sits.

155
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:46,137
Look at the muscles
rippling under the skin.

156
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:47,034
That's anatomy.

157
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,172
Every great artist
knows anatomy.

158
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,172
Stay there, stay there.

159
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:58,275
Five minutes for this pose.

160
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,724
Just five minutes.

161
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:00,827
- [Connie] Hey, Michael.

162
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,620
[chuckling]

163
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,034
Did you get to the building?

164
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,517
- Yeah but it's all blocked
up, he can't get in.

165
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:11,689
You know what, they say
there's still bodies--

166
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:12,137
- Silencio!

167
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,758
Look at the shadow
under the belly.

168
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:23,172
[speaking foreign language]

169
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:23,655
Three dimension.

170
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:25,689
Look at him!

171
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,482
[children giggling]

172
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:32,551
Up.

[grunting]

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,758
That's a pig, it's not a dog!

176
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,206
Start again!

177
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,310
Down Jim, down Jim.

178
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,310
- Almost a dog, Orson.

179
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,137
Almost.

180
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:57,655
Up, Jim, up, up.

181
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,965
Look at him.

182
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,137
Don't use imagination.

183
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,862
- I don't use
imagination, Signor.

184
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,172
I use the charcoal.

185
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:12,172
- Oh, mamma mia.

186
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,551
- [Connie] That's
my little sister.

187
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,068
- Don't, Wong.

188
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:15,793
I will get to you I a minute.

189
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,793
Oh, beautiful,
beautiful, Jennifer.

190
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,413
Oh, fantastic.

191
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:24,482
And you?

192
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,068
You have done nothing.

193
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:31,896
- But, Signor, I can't do him.

194
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,206
He keeps sitting down.

195
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:33,620
- Oh yeah.

196
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,482
[speaking foreign language]

197
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,896
- Oh, it's scary, Signor.

198
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,517
[chuckling]

199
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:54,206
- Put it in your bedroom.

200
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,241
- [Connie] Watch out, Mike!

201
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,172
- What are these
serious squiggles?

202
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,172
- They're flames, Signor.

203
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:06,586
- Flames?

204
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,206
I do not see any flames on Jim.

205
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:12,620
[children giggling]

206
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,068
- I imagined them.

207
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,551
- You imagined them?

208
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,413
You dare to imagine in my class?

209
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,448
I told you a thousand
times, no imagination!

210
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,103
Only what you see!

211
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:27,620
I want accuracy!

212
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,172
This is accurate!

213
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,620
This is the dog.

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,758
That is rubbish!

215
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:43,275
- [Michael] But, Signor.

216
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,068
- Start again.

217
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:51,034
- If his father sells paintings

218
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,275
for six thousand
dollars a piece,

219
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:52,793
what was wrong with his?

220
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,137
- Let's see what you
have done wrong, Wong.

221
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,172
You have done wrong, Wong.

222
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,137
[chuckling]

223
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,137
- If you do that, Signor,

224
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,413
I will never come to your
class again and I swear it.

225
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,034
- [Man] Hello there.

226
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:17,551
- [Dad] Okay,
Arthur, come on up.

227
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:21,172
- Arise he said

228
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,068
and

229
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:25,206
arise I did.

230
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:28,379
Ah.

231
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,137
- Over here we have...

232
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:39,379
"Relaxing Bird."

233
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:45,413
- [Arthur] Ugh.

234
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:50,310
- "Well Dressed Bird."

235
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,241
[Arthur laughing]

236
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,620
- That's amusing.

237
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
[laughing]

238
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes but empty.

239
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,172
- "Bird Singing to Cat."

240
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:02,655
- Oh.

241
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:05,689
Hmmmmm.

242
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:09,724
- Thanks a lot Bunny Bugs.

243
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:15,620
So,

244
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,758
what's wrong with my birds?

245
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,000
- Oh, they're marvelous, Billy.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,517
But--

247
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,862
- But my last show
was a sellout.

248
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,724
- Yes, yes.

249
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,172
But these I can't
sell, I'm sorry.

250
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,275
- Well, you could at least try.

251
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,379
Betty's gone to Australia,
her father died.

252
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,241
Do you have any idea how much
money that is costing me?

253
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,896
- Billy, my clients don't care
about your personal problems.

254
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:39,517
You know that.

255
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:43,448
What's that?

256
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,172
- Don't, don't touch that.

257
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:45,862
Don't touch that.

258
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,310
Nobody touches anything here
but me, all right, all right?

259
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,862
- May I at least look at it?

260
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:49,137
- Yes.

261
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:49,655
You may.

262
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,103
At least look at it.

263
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,000
- Hmmmm.

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,896
Lovely, just lovely.

265
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:00,413
That I could sell tomorrow.

266
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,379
- Well, you're not going
to, it's not for sale.

267
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,103
It's a birthday present.

268
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,758
- At six thousand dollars
for it, I'd say.

269
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:08,793
That's four thousand
dollars for you, Billy.

270
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,689
- No.

271
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,724
I said no and I mean no.

272
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,310
[somber music]

273
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,482
- Uh oh, how're we gonna get in?

274
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:25,586
[crow squawking]

275
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:26,724
Holy mackerel!

276
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:30,758
You gonna try it?

277
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,137
I said, are you gonna try it?

278
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:38,000
- [Michael] No, I'm gonna do it.

279
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:40,310
I'm going around here.

280
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:43,586
- Hey, Michael.

281
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:46,517
Come this way, it's easier.

282
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,241
[ominous music]

283
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,172
[grunting]

284
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,206
[thudding]

285
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,896
Ah.

286
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:06,344
My leg, ah.

287
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:08,724
Ah.

288
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,379
Hey, Michael, stop!

289
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:19,758
Come on, Mike, please
don't be so stupid.

290
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,034
Look, I'm sorry I
suggested it, okay?

291
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:22,551
It's suicide.

292
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:28,275
Okay, if you're gonna be
so stupid, I'm gonna leave.

293
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,758
I tell you, I'm
leaving right now.

294
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,275
I tell you, I'm leaving.

295
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,000
[Michael screaming]

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,068
[eerie music]

297
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:55,758
Mike!

298
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:58,068
Speak to me!

299
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,620
[computer beeping]

300
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:14,275
[calculator cranking]

301
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,068
[knocking]

302
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:20,655
- He's not home yet.

303
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,275
He's not home yet!

304
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:27,551
What for?

305
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,482
I told you, he's not
home yet, dingy.

306
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:40,310
- I know, he's over there.

307
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,172
- Michael, get out of there.

308
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,793
- [Connie] He can't,
he's unconscientious.

309
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:47,827
- [Suzie] How can he
be unconscientious?

310
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,137
- He had a little accident.

311
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,103
- I'm getting Dad.

312
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,103
- [Connie] No, don't.

313
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,827
Just help me lift him up.

314
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,793
[somber music]

315
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,275
- Where am I?

316
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,310
- It's okay, son,
you're home now.

317
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,517
- I phoned the hospital.

318
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,482
Doctors don't make house calls.

319
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:07,551
- Oh great, the kid could
be dying for all they care.

320
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,931
- Am I dying?

321
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,413
- No, you look pretty
much alive to me, kiddo.

322
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,344
So what happened to you?

323
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,551
- I don't remember.

324
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:17,620
Except for...

325
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,517
[eerie music]

326
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:27,275
Connie and I were going
to the burnt up mansion.

327
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,586
- Darn you, Conrad, that's
just what I thought.

328
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,206
- No, I tried to stop
him for the longest time.

329
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,551
- Stop him from what?

330
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:34,896
- Remember this morning
I told you about the fire

331
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,931
and you got angry at
me about the whinos?

332
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,724
Well he went to see it too

333
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,482
but we were late for
soccer practice

334
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,551
and said after school
hoping you'd forget

335
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:45,172
but then in art class it
all got started again.

336
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,896
- [Billy] What got
started again?

337
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,379
- About us going to the fire

338
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,689
and when we got there,

339
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,448
one of us had the idea
of looking inside.

340
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:54,620
When I tried I said,
"Hey, stop, it's suicide."

341
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,206
But he said there
were still survivors.

342
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,689
And I said I was leaving

343
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,758
but when he didn't
leave, I didn't leave.

344
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,275
So he got to the window
and he saw something.

345
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:03,137
- [Suzie And Billy]
But what did he see?

346
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:07,586
- I don't remember.

347
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,793
- Poor thing.

348
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:11,758
He's got a bad case of amnesia.

349
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,586
- Hey, you're a lucky boy.

350
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,551
You've had yourself some
sort of extraordinary fright.

351
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,310
But just think,

352
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,724
people pay good money for
a fright at the movies

353
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,000
and you got yourself
one for free.

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,793
[chuckling]
Right?

355
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,862
- [Michael] Yeah.

356
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:25,241
- We'll see you later, Conrad.

357
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:30,655
- Will he be at school tomorrow?

358
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:31,482
- [Suzie] Of course.

359
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:31,793
- Scat!

360
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:36,000
[ominous music]

361
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,310
How's he sleeping?

362
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,551
- Fine, but I found the cat

363
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,931
curled up on his
head like a fur hat.

364
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,448
So I kicked it off.

365
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,379
I don't believe it.

366
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,275
- [Billy] Jeez, I hate that cat.

367
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:57,137

- Hi.

372
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:14,310
Is it all right if I drop
in early before school?

373
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,172
I feel sorta bad
about yesterday,

374
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,275
even if it wasn't my fault.

375
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,379
- What's the point of asking?

376
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:19,689
You're already in.

377
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:22,379
That's all right.

378
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,206
- How is he then?

379
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,206
- Oh, he's fine.

380
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,241
He'll be down in a sec.

381
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,827
Here, have some toast.

382
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,862
- No thanks.

383
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,344
I think I'd rather stick to
grapes if you don't mind?

385

do we have soccer today?

- Michael!

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,344
Where's your hair?

389
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,758
- What's wrong with my hair?

390
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,551
- You don't any.

391
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,448
- Don't panic.

392
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:52,655
Just sit down here and...

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,655
and let me think thing through.

394
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,275
- But Dad, he's--

395
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,034
- Shut up, Suz!

396
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:01,379
It's the cat.

397
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,310
It's that damn cat.

398
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,793
I'm gonna ring its neck.

399
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,862
- No, Dad, no, not the cat!

00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,551

head all night, wasn't it?

401
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,068
Let go!

402

The thing might have rabies!

- Connie, do I have
any hair at all?

404
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:15,448

But what's it gonna be
like tomorrow morning?

Come on.

00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:44,931
- Rough and stubbly.

- That's right.

424
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:48,517

be like tomorrow morning?

Rough as sand paper.

- [Michael] I had hair
the last time you saw me.

Don't you remember?

- The cat slept on
his head last night.

We think he caught
something from it.

- Cats give rashes,
cats give fleas.

Cats can transmit all
sorts of disease.

00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,068
- So could it be the cat?

449
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:58,965
- He is no cat.

450
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,068
Huh?

451
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:02,448
He had a fright, you say?

- [Billy] That's right, he did.

- It's that fright, for sure.

The proper medical term
is Hair'em Scare'em.

- "Oh, boo" to you too.

what happened?

One moment, they're all
there hanging on to the desk,

along came a fright and
bam, they all go away.

00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,275
The same as your hairs.

One minute they're there,
the next minute, all gone.

will grow again?

Now just give it a chance, huh?

Yeah, he wanted to do a series
called "Bald Is Beautiful."

What's wrong with
your friend, Michael?

He's away from school, no?

- I don't know, sir.

- No, sir, please, can I go?

00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,793
- So, you don't know
that there is something

498
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:19,586
very funny about this problem?

What's going on?

It's 3AM.

00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:03,793

I was climbing up to the fray.

But again, Dad, I
couldn't see it.

515
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:14,482
I gotta see it, Dad.

- Look, don't worry
about it, Mikey.

Nature's wonderful,

it'll come back when
it wants to by itself.

- Mike, she's gone to
sell Grandpa's house.

521

Now what good is that gonna do?

524
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:39,551
It's only gonna upset
her, isn't it?

525
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:40,586
Come on, come on, just
snuggle down in here.

526
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,137
- Signor, I must have a
serious talk with you.

527
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:56,310
I've had a call from
little William's mother.

528
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,620
He's been having nightmares
every night this week.

- Oh, Jim, naughty Jim.

530

Very sorry.

531
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,758
He loves it.

give him wolves for his walls.

Their heads are in the clouds.

542
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,172
I tell them to draw dogs

543
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,206

- What checking?

00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:54,655
- Come on, Mary.

733
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:56,896
- "One rotten egg."

734
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:59,448
- [Michael] "One rotten
egg, put it on my head."

735
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:02,103
- "Three liquorish leaves."

736
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:04,758
- [Michael] "Three liquorish
leaves, put them on my head."

737
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,310
- Hurry it up, Mary.

738
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,689
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,448
"A fist-full of kitty litter."

740
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:11,827
- "A fist-full of kitty litter."

741
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:12,896
- "Three connie crisps."

742
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,137
- "Three connie crisps."

743
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:16,103
- "Three crosby crackers."

744
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:18,137
- "Three crosby crackers."

745
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,103
- "Nine spoons of soil."

746
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,482
- "Nine spoons of soil."

747
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:23,172
- And "a glass of pepper spizz."

748
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,034
- [Michael] What's pepper spizz?

749
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,689
- Oh, it's mouth water.

750
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:28,206
The biggest mouth
water in the world.

751
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,103
- Put it all on my head.

752
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:30,965
- [Whino] We gotta go, Mary.

753
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:32,827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:35,517
Now, last thing is a spoon
full of peanut butter

755
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,517
and that's very important

756
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,551
because it makes it
all stick together.

757
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,827
But don't use too much
of it or watch out.

758
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,000
- [Michael] What'll happen?

759
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,379
- Well, it ain't for me to say.

760
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:48,827
You just watch out, huh?

761
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,827
And watch your hands.

762
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:51,482
Don't get it on your hands.

763
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:54,448
It's libel to grow
hair on your hands

764
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,586
if you get it on them.

765
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:57,103
- My hands?

766
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,551
- On your nose.

767
00:37:58,551 --> 00:37:59,137
- My nose?

768
00:37:59,137 --> 00:38:00,103
- Sure.

769
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,137
Anything.

770
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,758
[laughing]

771
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:04,310
- I hope it works, baldy.

772
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:17,310
[somber chiming music]

773
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:35,517
- [Suzie] Dad, he's
digging up earth.

774
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:39,379
You don't think he's
gonna eat it, do you?

775
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,068
- [Billy] Beats me, Suz.

776
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,206
I've heard pregnant women get
a craving for earth sometimes.

777
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:49,310
- [Suzie] He couldn't
be pregnant, could he?

778
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,310
- [Billy] Unlikely, I'd say.

779
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,413
- And last but not least,
a glass of pepper spizz.

780
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,344
[sizzling]

781
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:02,103
[blender buzzing]

782
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:03,275
- Got you!

783
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,724
Throw it down the toilet, quick!

784
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:05,620
Quick!

785
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,758
- Don't!

786
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,034
- Mike, I'm sorry.

787
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:08,965
We couldn't let you drink that.

788
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,413
That stuff could kill you.

789
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,172
- I wasn't gonna drink it!

790
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:13,241
- No?

791
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,517
[toilet flushing]

792
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:21,586
- [Boy] No, you go get it!

793
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:25,758
I'm not moving.
[Suzie laughing]

794
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,586
- Right there, right there.

795
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,275
Ah!

796
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:31,482
- [Boy] Aw, right
into the garden.

797
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,034
[pleasant chiming music]

798
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:43,206
- [Mary] Ah, the boy
who forgot my recipe.

799
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:43,793
- Please tell it to me again.

800
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,206
It really wasn't my fault.

801
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,172
- That's life, sweetheart.

802
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,379
You don't get no second chance.

803
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:57,413
- Don't be so hard on him, Mary.

804
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:59,206
I've seen lots of people
give you second chances.

805
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:00,620
- So what?

806
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:06,793
Sometimes I'm nice but
sometimes I'm mean.

807
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:10,379
I never know myself
which it's gonna be.

808
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:15,172
Looks like tonight
it's mean, ain't it?

809
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:21,000
- Well, if you won't be good,
I'll have to make you, Mary.

810
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:26,310
Here, kid.

811
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,068
Best of luck.

812
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:31,275
- Nutmeg.

813
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:34,758
Three corsby crackers.

814
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:39,620
Okay, let's start
with the flies.

815
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,206
Five dead flies.

816
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,655
[jazzy music]

817
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,758
- [Billy] Dibble-dabble
will do it.

818
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:07,551
Nearly done.

819
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:11,620
[clinking]

820
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:16,310

821
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,413
- [Michael Voiceover]
Oh, what a smell.

822

[whispering]

823
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,482
[jazzy music]

824
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,137
Wow.

825
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,034
I'm gonna put this
stuff on my head?

826
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,413
I must be crazy.

827
00:41:58,586 --> 00:41:59,068
Oh no.

828
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,206
I'll have hair on my face.

829
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:03,586
On my hands.

830
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:08,413
I've gotta make it less runny.

831
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,931
I just gotta put more
peanut butter in.

832
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,896
That's the only solution.

833
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,689
Two, three, four, five
spoons of peanut butter.

834
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:20,655
That's enough.

835
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:25,103
[pleasant piano music]

836
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,241
Hey, it works.

837
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:37,241
This has to be right.

838
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:40,482
I'm a better painter than Dad.

[birds chirping]

840
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:46,206
- [Suzie] Coffee's ready, Dad.

841
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:50,758
Is that me?

842
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,689
I look like I'm
trying to swat flies.

843
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:56,793
I'm sorry, Dad, but nobody
holds a racquet like that.

844
00:42:56,793 --> 00:43:00,206
- If I wanted real, I
would've taken a bloody photo.

845
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,551
Well, I was gonna give it
to you for your birthday

846
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:03,758
but maybe you don't like it.

847
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:04,724
- Dad.

848
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:07,965
[chuckling]

849
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:10,620
- That's Mom and that's Michael.

850
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,034
The brat.

[shower trickling]

852
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:31,103
- Nothing.

853
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,793
Not even a hair.

854
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,310
I'm sorry I was so mad
at you last night.

855
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,758
- Oh, you scared me.

856
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:47,896
What's that on your head?

857
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:49,068
- I don't have anything on my
head, I just took a shower.

858
00:43:49,068 --> 00:43:51,241
- Wait a minute, look.

859
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:52,000
You've got something
on your head.

860
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:54,241
Wait.

861
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:57,586
- But I washed it off.

862
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:01,551
- Where is that darn thing?

863
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:05,551

You've got little baby bristles.

- [Michael] You
sure it's not guck?

867

- No, it's hair!

the matter now?

00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:31,413
- [Suzie] Dad, so
glad you're here!

00:44:31,413 --> 00:44:33,172
Michael's got hair!

876
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:37,896
All right!

This is it, buddy!

I told you so,
nature's wonderful.

Spring is sprung and
the leaves are budding

and the flowers are shooting

882
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,206
and your head got the message.

883
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,482

I'm so happy for you.

- Oh, my head's
tingling all over.

- Oh God, it's growing
a hundred miles an hour.

in the mirror too.

00:45:27,482 --> 00:45:27,793
- Wow.

- Oh, wow!

898
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:37,620
Look at this!

899
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,103
- Okay, Mike, out with it

900
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,172
or it's the end of a
great friendship.

901
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:45,517
- What do you mean?

902
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:48,482
- The truth, come
on, what'd you do?

903
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,827
- Oh, look at that, I can
almost see it growing.

904
00:45:50,827 --> 00:45:52,172
- Quit stalling.

905
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:52,758
Now how did you make it grow?

906
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:00,689
- This.

907
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:02,344
My secret recipe.

908
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,586
- Yeah, where'd you get it?

909
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:06,793
- It's a long story,
tell you later.

910
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:07,862
- Put that on your head?

911
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:09,655
Did it hurt?

912
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:10,724
- No but it's dangerous.

913
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:11,655
- Let me try it.

914
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,241
- Why?

915
00:46:13,241 --> 00:46:14,000
You don't need it, you
got lots of hair.

916
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,620
- Sure, but...

917
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,137
- But what?

918
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:19,137
- Well, I wanna put
some down there.

919
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:20,758
- Are you crazy?

920
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:21,965
No, now get out of here

921
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:22,586
and let a guy do
what he's gotta do.

922
00:46:24,137 --> 00:46:24,517
- You're crazy.

923
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:28,172
Absolutely crazy.

924
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:28,586
- [Suzie] Who's crazy?

925
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:32,793
- Connie.
[laughing]

926
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:33,965
- It's unbelievable.

927
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,103
- What?

928
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:36,827
- It's growing so fast.

929
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,344
- It's true, it's so long.

930
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,724
- Dad, could I call Mom?

931
00:46:40,724 --> 00:46:41,758
- Sure.

932
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:42,379
- Thanks, Dad.

933
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:47,517
Dad, the country code
for Australia is

934
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:51,068
0-1-1-6-1-2?

935
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:52,379
- [Billy] That's right.

936
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,275
- [Michael] Hi, girls.

937
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:08,206
- He's back.

938
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:09,689
Probably with another
one of his wigs.

939
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:10,793
- No, it isn't, look.

940
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:11,517
You can see his scalp.

941
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:18,275
- Yuck, he's got dandruff.

942
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:20,206
- [Connie] See?

943
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:22,103
If it was a wig, would
he have dandruff?

944
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:23,448
- I guess not.

945
00:47:23,448 --> 00:47:26,344
[school bell ringing]

946
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,379
- Mom said you have to come
home right after school.

947
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:28,724
- Okay.

948
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:33,137
- [Man] Decimal point here and

949
00:47:35,448 --> 00:47:35,689
25 and 56

950
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:38,275
of twice.

951
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,034
And we bring down the six

952
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,827
and we remember to
move the decimal point

953
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:49,689
and 25 into 56 goes two times.

954
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:52,896
[girls giggling]

955
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:56,413
Two times 25 is 50, quiet class.

956
00:47:56,413 --> 00:47:58,241
And we bring down the six.

957
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,103
[giggling]

958
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:02,103
- [Girl] Stop it.

959
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:04,862
[giggling]

960
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:05,482
- Leave his hair alone, girls.

961
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:09,379
- Mr. Gingras, it's moving.

962
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:13,034
- [Connie] But it's alive, sir.

963
00:48:22,137 --> 00:48:24,275
- It's not moving.

964
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:26,103
It's just too long.

965
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,137
- It was short
this morning, sir.

966
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,448
- Nonsense.

967
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,862
What kind of a dodo
do you take me for?

968
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:34,275
[students giggling]

969
00:48:34,275 --> 00:48:35,827
Human hair grows only
half an inch a month.

970
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:37,206
No more.

971
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,034
- Not my hair, sir.

972
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:43,793
- He's gonna love this.

973
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,379
It's his favorite.

974
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:46,551
Taranto Noodle Soup.

975
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:51,689
- Mmmmmm.

976
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,758
[laughing]

977
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:57,275
- Oh hi, Connie.

978
00:48:58,896 --> 00:48:59,965
Where is he?

979
00:48:59,965 --> 00:49:00,310
- What timing.

980
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:06,758
- Now that's a head of hair.

981
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:09,206
Well done, son.

982
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:11,137
- I don't think
it's natural, Dad.

983
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:13,137
It grew six inches
on the way home.

984
00:49:13,137 --> 00:49:13,689
- Well, it'll settle down.

985
00:49:15,793 --> 00:49:18,068
Don't worry, it's
young, it's frisky.

986
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:19,379
Come on, to the table, everyone.

987
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,137
- [Michael] Oh, excuse me.

988
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:28,413
- Lady and gentlemen,

989
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:31,689
a toast to this new hair.

990
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:32,724
- To the new hair.

991
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:33,620
- To the new hair.

992
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,068
- Long may it grow.

993
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:35,862
- [Suzie] On my head too.

994
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:38,551
[chuckling]

995
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:40,103
Oh.

996
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,827
[giggling]

997
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:43,655
Don't worry, I'll clean it up.

998
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:48,068
- Can you cut my bangs?

999
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,896
- What?

1000
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:50,586
- Can you cut my bangs, please?

1001
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:54,689
- But it's so beautiful.

1002
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:56,172
Don't you realize I'd do
anything for hair like this?

1003
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,413
- Don't cut it.

1004
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,758
You could make the world's
Guinness book of records.

1005
00:50:00,758 --> 00:50:01,241
- [Michael] Please?

1006
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:04,896
- If you insist.

1007
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:06,896
- The longest human
hair known on this world

1008
00:50:06,896 --> 00:50:09,758
grew up to be 28 feet on a guru.

1009
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,551
[chuckling]

1010
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:15,413
- Conrad, I owe you an apology.

1011
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:16,172
I have not been nice to you.

1012
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,517
- [Connie] It's
okay, Mr. Baskin.

1013
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:19,793
- Oh.

1014
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:21,758
All right.

1015
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:29,931
How was it at school
when he came back?

1016
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,310
- They thought it
was another wig

1017
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,137
but then I showed
them his dandruff.

1018
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:34,724
[Billy chuckling]

1019
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:35,068
- [Billy] Good lad.

1020
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:38,586
- Now, class, I
want you to enter

1021
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:40,517
these last two equations
in your exercise books

1022
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:42,689
and do them along with me.

1023
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:45,034
11 into 67 six times.

1024
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:49,241
Six times 11, 66.

1025
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:50,793
And we bring the one down.

1026
00:50:50,793 --> 00:50:53,517
And the six.

1027
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,448
11 into 16, one.

1028
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:04,275
Okay, you two, this is a
classroom, not a barber shop.

1029
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,379
And 11 into 16, we've
done that now...

1030
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,517
11, right, and five and
we bring down the other.

1031
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,448
Okay.

1032
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:34,482
Down to Miss Prume, both of you.

1033
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:40,758
- Sir, for two weeks
now I've been bald.

1034
00:51:40,758 --> 00:51:42,655
We did everything to
get my hair back.

1035
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:44,551
Nothing worked.

1036
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:49,241
At last I tried this
extremely dangerous mixture.

1037
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,206
It worked but now
my hair won't stop.

1038
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:53,689
My only chance is for this
guy to keep on cutting.

1039
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:56,827
Please let me stay.

1040
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:58,517
I want to be educated.

[applauding and cheering]

1042
00:52:00,379 --> 00:52:02,000

Out.

1047
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:11,241
And move it!

1049
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:22,344

snipping is too distracting.

1050
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:24,862
I've had three teachers
tell me today they'll resign

1051
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:27,172
if you go back in their classes.

1052
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:30,000
So finish your class and
then you better go home.

1053
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,793
And you, Connie, I think
you've got a problem too.

1054
00:52:38,724 --> 00:52:39,310

It's unbearable.

1060
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:29,379
Stop.

1061
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:33,000
I said, stop.

1062
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,310
Stop growing right now.

don't want you there.

01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:23,689
- Of course.

1273
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,896
- Meanwhile, you better
start making brushes.

1274
01:06:25,896 --> 01:06:27,517
- We have to make 500
a day or we won't eat.

1275
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,034
- How do I do it?

1276
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:32,413
- Look, take this piece

1277
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:33,206
and stick it in the
handle like this.

1278
01:06:36,482 --> 01:06:37,896
- Like this?

1279
01:06:37,896 --> 01:06:39,482
- [Michael] Signor!

1280
01:06:39,482 --> 01:06:39,793
- Wow.

1281
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:44,206
- [Michael] Signor!

1282
01:06:44,206 --> 01:06:46,896
- Does all this
come from Michael?

1283
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:49,827
- [Girl] Yeah, the Signor has
him on a special yogurt diet.

1284
01:06:49,827 --> 01:06:50,172
- [Michael] Signor!

1285
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,862
- [Connie] How'd he get you all?

1286
01:06:54,862 --> 01:06:56,448
- [Boy] Through lies.

1287
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:58,000
- [Girl] Through hypnosis.

1288
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,931
- [Boy] Through ice creams
that put you asleep.

1289
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:00,931
[shushing]

1290
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:02,379
- He's listening.

1291
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:03,241
There's microphones.

1292
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:10,241
There's one way to
escape but it's no good.

1293
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:12,724
[ominous piano music]

1294
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:21,275
- Wow.

1295
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:23,655
[birds chirping]

1296
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:25,793
Fantastic.

1297
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:29,655
- Yeah, he makes them with
his own magic paintbrushes.

1298
01:07:29,655 --> 01:07:31,793
[birds chirping]

1299
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,034
- [Connie] Jim!

1300
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:38,758
- [Mia Ling] He always does Jim.

1301
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:43,482
[water trickling]

1302
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:47,448
- You know these paintings?

1303
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:50,241
They're so real, you can
just walk right into them.

1304
01:07:50,241 --> 01:07:52,448
- [Connie] So why not escape?

1305
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,896
- [Boy] It wouldn't work
because Jeremy tried it once

1306
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:55,448
but he had to come back.

1307
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,620
- Why?

1308
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:00,137
- 'Cause they're all
imaginary places, you know?

1309
01:08:00,137 --> 01:08:02,448
He never painted a
real place, you know,

1310
01:08:02,448 --> 01:08:06,000
something like a town or a road

1311
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,758
or a street or
anything like that.

1312
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:13,620
- [Connie] Hmmm.

1313
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:18,724
The Signor is a tougher
cookie than I thought.

1314
01:08:21,448 --> 01:08:22,896
- [Both] The Rabbit's
your brother?

1315
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:24,103
- The Rabbit?

1316
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:25,206
That's cute.

1317
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:27,793
Yes, he's my brother.

1318
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:29,724
The other one, he's in art too.

1319
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:34,586
Sergio we used to call
him when we were kids.

1320
01:08:34,586 --> 01:08:35,827
A loony.

1321
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:38,689
A loony, Sergio.

1322
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,448
Now he's got no name
at all, imagine that.

1323
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:41,724
No name.

1324
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:42,517
Just "The Signor."

1325
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:46,862
- [Both] The Signor?

1326
01:08:46,862 --> 01:08:48,034
- Yeah.

1327
01:08:48,034 --> 01:08:49,827
He's no rabbit.

1328
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:52,034
A fox, maybe.

1329
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:53,551
The Signor is the one
who has kidnapped Michael

1330
01:08:53,551 --> 01:08:56,034
and probably 20 other kids.

1331
01:08:56,034 --> 01:08:58,275
- Your other
brother, the Rabbit,

1332
01:08:58,275 --> 01:08:59,965
he must know where he is.

1333
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:02,137
- Maybe he does

1334
01:09:02,137 --> 01:09:05,655
but Arthur is not
going to help you

1335
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:08,000
if Sergio don't want it.

1336
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,103
They're very close.

1337
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,517
They're twins.

1338
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:13,103
- You wanna bet he won't help?

1339
01:09:13,103 --> 01:09:14,551
- [Suzie] You said
they're twins?

1340
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:16,103
They don't look at
all like each other.

1341
01:09:16,103 --> 01:09:18,172
- [Epstein] Well of course
they're not identical twins.

1342
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:24,103
- He better be here.

1343
01:09:32,724 --> 01:09:34,137
- Billy,

1344
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:36,344
Abe and Suzie.

1345
01:09:36,344 --> 01:09:38,586
How nice to see you.

1346
01:09:38,586 --> 01:09:41,137
What a surprise.

1347
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:43,758
My goodness, to
what do I owe this?

1348
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:45,275
- Okay, Arthur,
where's your brother?

1349
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:46,827
- Well, he's right beside you.

1350
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:48,379
- Not that one, the other one.

1351
01:09:48,379 --> 01:09:51,724
- Ah, the other one,
he died I think.

1352
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:54,275
- Not that one, the
other one, damn it.

1353
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,620
- He means Sergio, the Signor.

1354
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,620
- Oh, the Signor.

1355
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,034
I have no idea.

1356
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,689
- Cut the crap, you're
buying paintings from him!

1357
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:04,896
- Paintings down with
my brother's hair!

1358
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:05,758
- Believe me, I don't know!

1359
01:10:07,965 --> 01:10:10,103
- Spill it, you sniveling rat!

1360
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:11,482
- You have to spit it out.

1361
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:15,000
There are 20 kids missing.

1362
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,137
- But he won't give me
any more if his pictures.

1363
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:19,068
He's here

1364
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:21,344
Fridays.

1365
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:23,517
- Fridays.

1366
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,517
Fridays?

1367
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:29,344
- It's only Tuesday.

1368
01:10:29,344 --> 01:10:29,689
Fridays.

1369
01:10:31,724 --> 01:10:33,413

[ominous music]

1372
01:11:02,965 --> 01:11:04,275
- Where you going, Connie?

1373
01:11:04,275 --> 01:11:05,034
- I'm gonna see Michael.

1374
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:05,413
- You can't.

1375
01:11:07,206 --> 01:11:08,862
That floor is full of tripwires.

1376
01:11:08,862 --> 01:11:09,275
They're invisible.

1377
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:12,896
You can't go, you touch
one, he's gonna wake up.

1378
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:13,344
- Then I won't.

1379
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:18,448
- I already told you,
they're invisible.

1380
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:19,448
- Look, I came here to
save Michael, okay?

1381
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:24,896
- [Boy] Okay, take my invention.

1382
01:11:24,896 --> 01:11:25,793
It's invisible string detector.

1383
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,931
- What's he doing out of bed?

01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:22,448
- [Connie] Holy shmolly.

1389
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:45,827
- Signor, is that you?

1390
01:12:45,827 --> 01:12:46,758
- No.

[shushing]

1392
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,034
It's me, Connie.

1393
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:50,827
I've come to get
you out of here.

1394
01:12:50,827 --> 01:12:51,241
- Is it really you?

1395
01:12:53,344 --> 01:12:54,275
You're a wonderful friend.

1396
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:58,034
But what's the use?

1397
01:12:58,034 --> 01:12:58,586
- Don't talk like that.

1398
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:02,896
- I mean, all this hair.

[shushing]

1400
01:13:05,068 --> 01:13:08,137
And this hair has some use.

1401
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:10,310
The Signor tells me they're
making wonderful pictures.

1402
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:13,241
- Yeah, disgustingly beautiful.

1403
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:14,000
Your dad would puke.

[sinister music]
- Oh ha!

1405
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:21,206
Good evening, Inspector.

1406
01:13:21,206 --> 01:13:23,206
Working late?

1407
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:24,344
- Hold on, Michael,
I'll be back.

Throw it, Conrad, throw it!

01:13:58,793 --> 01:14:00,103
Let me go!

01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,275
Let me go!

1418
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:03,068
You win.

1419
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:05,448
For the moment.

1420
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:12,758
- Round and round
goes the Inspector.

1421
01:14:12,758 --> 01:14:15,068
Inspecting the ceiling,
inspecting the walls,

1422
01:14:15,068 --> 01:14:16,206

01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:20,344
I'm gonna throw up.

1426
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:24,931

Please, Father.

1429
01:14:33,379 --> 01:14:35,724
- I am not your father.

1430
01:14:35,724 --> 01:14:36,137
I will let you down.

1431
01:14:37,379 --> 01:14:39,620
No son.

1432
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,689
- [Connie] But I want
you for my father.

1433
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:44,551
- This is some
little trick, huh?

1434
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:45,620
- My real father died
in a plane crash

1435
01:14:48,137 --> 01:14:50,448
and I want you for my father.

1436
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:53,206
You're such a wonderful artist.

1437
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:55,689
What a wonderful teacher.

1438
01:14:55,689 --> 01:14:57,965
- That is true now,
that is true now.

1439
01:14:57,965 --> 01:14:59,655
- What a fantastical liar.

1440
01:14:59,655 --> 01:15:01,482
- I am rid of this.

1441
01:15:01,482 --> 01:15:04,448

1443
01:15:11,413 --> 01:15:13,206

01:15:13,206 --> 01:15:15,137
[shushing]

1445
01:15:17,448 --> 01:15:18,758
- Please let me be
your son, please.

1446
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:21,586
- I will consider it.

1447
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:24,482
I never had children.

1448
01:15:26,137 --> 01:15:26,620
Only dog.

1449
01:15:29,862 --> 01:15:31,275
Now back to work.

1450
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:32,482
Artists everywhere are
waiting for our brushes.

1451
01:15:38,793 --> 01:15:39,310
My son.

1452
01:15:41,172 --> 01:15:42,517
Children,

1453
01:15:42,517 --> 01:15:43,586
I have been asked to demonstrate

1454
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:48,172
the art of magical painting

1455
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:50,344
which is to do something
that I've never seen

1456
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:52,793
and with no photograph.

1457
01:15:55,275 --> 01:15:58,482
My son will give me a subject

1458
01:15:58,482 --> 01:16:01,758
and in one minute or less,

1459
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,793
it will appear on
the biggest canvas.

1460
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:07,068
I am ready, my son.

1461
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:09,793
- Could you possibly do

1462
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:14,689
Michael's Fright, Dad?

1463
01:16:16,689 --> 01:16:17,103
- Michael's Fright.

1464
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:19,000
What is that?

1465
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:22,758
- The thing that made
his hair fall off

1466
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:24,275
in the burnt out building.

1467
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:26,172
The Fright.

1468
01:16:26,172 --> 01:16:27,310
- Burnt out building?

1469
01:16:29,172 --> 01:16:30,965
A burnt out building,
that's all?

1470
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:31,551
That's so easy.

1471
01:16:35,068 --> 01:16:36,793
[laughing]

1472
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:41,827
[somber music]

1473
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:43,655
Wait a minute.

1474
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:44,137
Wait.

1475
01:16:46,206 --> 01:16:47,586
And how about that, huh?

1476
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:52,034
[giggling]

1477
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:54,344
[pleasant music]

1478
01:17:00,517 --> 01:17:01,000
- Wow.

1479

[clapping]

1484
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,413
- Is wonderful, no?

1485
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:16,310
For you, my boy, just for you.

1486
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:22,310
- I'm sorry, Dad, but
that's not the Fright.

1487
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,413
That's just where it took place.

1488
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:26,896
- But brushes don't
know the Fright.

1489
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:28,689
They don't see the Fright.

1490
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:30,413
- But the painting
is so real, Dad.

1491
01:18:30,413 --> 01:18:31,137
We can get into it.

1492
01:18:33,068 --> 01:18:34,000
Let's go up to the
window and see.

1493
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,103
Here, I'll go first.

1494
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:36,034
- No, no, no.

1495
01:18:36,034 --> 01:18:37,310
Get back, my son.

1496
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,862
It could be dangerous.

1497
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:41,068
No, no, stay back.

1498
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:42,172
It could be dangerous.

1499
01:18:42,172 --> 01:18:43,758
Stand back, children.

1500
01:18:43,758 --> 01:18:44,793
I will go first, okay?

1501
01:18:47,862 --> 01:18:50,310

[children giggling]

1503
01:19:05,103 --> 01:19:06,827
You see, my boy, it's easy.

1504
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,000
[laughing]

1505
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,413
- Great, Dad.

1506
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:11,586
- He's pretty brave.

1507
01:19:11,586 --> 01:19:12,862
- [Connie] You're not
only a great painter, Dad,

1508
01:19:12,862 --> 01:19:14,172
you're a great climber!

1509
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:19,172
[ominous music]

1510
01:19:22,655 --> 01:19:23,586
- I am almost there.

1511
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,620
- [Connie] Look inside.

1512
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,793

[ominous music]

1515
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,931
- What happened to him?

1516
01:19:51,931 --> 01:19:54,103
- He's seen the Fright.

1517
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:56,689
- But is he still going
to be your father?

1518
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:59,724
- No, he was never
my father, okay?

1519
01:19:59,724 --> 01:20:01,689
It was just a trick to
get him to see the Fright.

1520
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:04,551
- But he was nice after
he became your father.

1521
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:06,413
- What's the matter
with you all?

1522
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:07,931
What about the things
he's done to you?

1523
01:20:07,931 --> 01:20:08,689
Have you forgotten already?

1524
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,000
[suspenseful music]

1525
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,344
- Can you believe it?

1526
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:28,689
After a week of searching,
I actually found my sugar.

[ominous music]

1528
01:20:35,034 --> 01:20:35,551
This must be it!

1529
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:38,551
Dad! Dad!

1530
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:44,655
- [Michael] Get me out of here!

1531
01:20:44,655 --> 01:20:46,068
Somebody!

1532
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:47,517
- Okay, okay, hold your horses.

1533
01:20:49,379 --> 01:20:50,551
- The hair stopped growing.

1534
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:52,172
- Of course.

1535
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:53,413
The Fright just passed
to somebody else.

1536
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:53,724
- Who?

1537
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:58,068
- It could happen
to a nicer guy.

1538
01:21:00,137 --> 01:21:00,655
- Watch out!

1539
01:21:03,379 --> 01:21:04,827
So it was him who
got the Fright?

1540
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:05,931
- [Connie] Yeah.

1541
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:06,448
Bring him into the toilet.

1542
01:21:09,275 --> 01:21:10,413
Careful, that's my father.

1543
01:21:12,344 --> 01:21:13,758
Don't get his pants dirty.

1544
01:21:13,758 --> 01:21:14,448
That's his only pair.

1545
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:24,620
- I'm gonna go see what it was.

1546
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:24,793
- Are you crazy?

1547
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:28,586
- No, okay, I wanna look inside.

1548
01:21:28,586 --> 01:21:29,965
It's all right.

1549
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:31,931
- Do you want this to
start all over again?

1550
01:21:31,931 --> 01:21:32,689
- It won't, believe me.

1551

1553
01:21:43,517 --> 01:21:45,793

you're just a showoff!

01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:19,758
Michael?!

[eerie music]

1560
01:22:33,034 --> 01:22:33,551
- What?

1561
01:22:36,103 --> 01:22:37,103
- Five dead flies!

1562
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:40,620
Wrong, dummy.

1563
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,310
50 dead flies.

[maniacal laughing]

1565
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,448
- Michael!

1566
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:52,034
What's happening in there?

1567
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:55,689
- Wrong again.

1568
01:22:57,586 --> 01:22:58,310
500 dead flies.

1569
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,137
Don't you learn no
flies in school?

1570
01:23:05,931 --> 01:23:07,620
- [Michael] But I know you.

1571
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,551
How could I've been
scared of you?

1572
01:23:10,551 --> 01:23:12,793
Anyway, you don't frighten
me anymore, that's for sure.

1573
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:14,275
- Hi there, young hairy.

1574
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:21,103
- And you,

1575
01:23:21,103 --> 01:23:21,758
are you gonna try
to scare me too?

1576
01:23:23,482 --> 01:23:26,379
Anyway, it doesn't work anymore.

1577
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:27,655
I suggest you keep it for
people like the Signor.

1578
01:23:27,655 --> 01:23:28,689
- You're a brave boy!

1579
01:23:30,103 --> 01:23:30,482
You'll go far.

1580
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:33,103
- It's all right.

1582
01:23:36,103 --> 01:23:37,275

I'm gonna try to break it open.

should fix him.

1614
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:18,413

I already tried it, it's locked!

1619
01:25:37,068 --> 01:25:39,000
- That was a trick.

1620
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,724
The real trick!

1621
01:25:41,896 --> 01:25:43,206
You can't do that to me!

You are my sons.
