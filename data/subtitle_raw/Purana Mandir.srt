2
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:36,410
<i>200 years ago Bijapur Sultanate
was ruled by Raja Hari Man Singh.</i>

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,070
<i>In those days the fear of ghosts and
spirits prevailed in the hearts of people.</i>

4
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,900
<i>The most feared demon of all
was called Saamri.</i>

5
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,520
<i>One day Raja Man Singh was travelling
with his daughter Rupali towards Bijapur...</i>

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,300
<i>...when his royal
chariot broke down.</i>

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,030
How long will it take?

8
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,080
Only a little while, sire.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,620
- Where has Rupali gone?
- She was just here.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,340
Rupali, Rupali!

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,670
Princess!

12
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,920
She shouldn't have left alone so late
in the night. This is Saamri's land!

13
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't just look at me!
Go and find her! Go!

14
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,400
Saamri!!

15
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,250
Cut him down!
Kill him!!

16
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,200
Find him, find him!
That demon came this way.

17
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,060
Quickly!

18
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,560
This royal proclamation
of Mughal King Hari Man Singh...

19
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:56,790
...states that Saamri
using his satanic powers...

20
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,150
...has created terror
in the state of Bijapur.

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,650
The accusation is that you unrobed
young married women...

22
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,230
...and violated their honor.

23
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,940
You are accused that
to slake your satanic thirst...

24
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,300
...you mercilessly killed
young and innocent children...

25
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,990
...and sucked their blood.

26
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,990
You have fallen so low
from the human level...

27
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,260
...that even Satan
would shun you.

28
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,480
To strengthen your evil powers
you opened graves...

29
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,270
...took out corpses...

30
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,650
...and...

31
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,230
...and ate them.

32
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,990
O, King, destroy
this creature now!

33
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,090
No! Entomb him in the wall.

34
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,150
King...

35
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,990
I believe that this monster
should be purged in pure fire...

36
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,630
...and thus be turned
forever into ashes.

37
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,740
No, holy man.

38
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,120
This demon's head
will be separated from his body.

39
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,290
The body will be buried
in the ruins behind this temple.

40
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,630
And his head...

41
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,710
...will remain under guard
in my palace, far from here.

42
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,600
That way, his head and his body
will never be joined together.

43
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:36,400
I beg you, my lord, guard the head
with this holy trident of Shiva.

44
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:43,120
Thus will all this demon's powers
be rendered ineffective.

45
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:57,244
'The old temple.'

46
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,910
Hari Man Singh...

47
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,970
...I curse you!

48
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,660
As long as my head and body
remain apart...

49
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,280
...all your female heirs
will die horribly..

50
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:41,880
...as soon as they give birth
to their first child!

51
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,690
And the day my head and body
are joined again...

52
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,330
...will be the end
of your dynasty!

53
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,380
<i>And so Hari Man Singh cut off
the head of that demon...</i>

54
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,510
<i>...and kept it
apart from the body.</i>

55
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:48,180
<i>The body was buried in the ruins
behind Shankar's Palighat temple.</i>

56
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:11,920
<i>The demon's head was put
in a trunk fastened with chains.</i>

57
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,700
<i>Raja Hari Singh secured that trunk
in the dungeon of his palace.</i>

58
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,920
<i>God Shiva's holy trident
was put on top of the trunk.</i>

59
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,740
<i>A wall was built across the door
of the dungeon...</i>

60
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,750
<i>...and the severed head was hidden
from the eyes of the world.</i>

61
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,240
<i>A painting of Hari Man Singh
was hung on the door.</i>

62
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,540
<i>And so the stories
of Saamri's evil faded...</i>

63
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,230
<i>...into the darkness
of the dungeon.</i>

64
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,850
<i>The river of time carried off
the main players.</i>

65
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,040
<i>The faces of Sher Khan,
Rajguru Balbir Singh and all the rest...</i>

66
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,660
<i>...became lost
in the mists of time.</i>

67
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,410
<i>The flame of Hari Singh's life
was extinguished.</i>

68
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,780
<i>After him the reins of the state
fell to Prithipal Singh</i>

69
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,490
<i>and then in the course of time,
Raja Ajit Singh.</i>

70
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,930
<i>After him, Thakur Ranbhir Singh
sat on the throne.</i>

71
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,520
<i>The dusts of time settled
over the ancient palace...</i>

72
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,060
<i>...and it became
forgotten about.</i>

73
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,700
<i>The pulse of life left
the palace area and moved to the city.</i>

74
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,940
<i>This is the last remaining heir
of Hari Man Singh - Ranbir Singh.</i>

75
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,010
<i>A grand and important man,
even today.</i>

76
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:54,200
<i>But the fear of Saamri still
prevails in his heart and mind.</i>

77
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,810
Sir, these papers need
your signature.

78
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,800
Give me a pen.

79
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,070
Have you sent the payment
to Gawahar Saw Mills?

80
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,050
Brother, dear.

81
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,780
Dayawanti,
has Suman left for college?

82
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,120
Really papa,
what kind of talk is that?

83
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,760
Does your daughter ever go to
college without meeting you?

84
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,930
And that is why I have been
rushing home.

85
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,040
I knew my little doll
would be waiting for me.

86
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,090
You call me your little doll!
But see how tall I've grown!

87
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,390
I reach your shoulders.

88
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,440
Brother, the child
has grown up.

89
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,290
Grown up!

90
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,100
Papa what's the matter?
What are you thinking?

91
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,780
Nothing, my dear.

92
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,870
I was just thinking...
aren't you getting late for college?

93
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,530
OK, papa. Bye Papa.

94
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,780
Bye, auntie.

95
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,300
I know the sorrow
in your heart.

96
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,730
If only I could share it.

97
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,770
In this world, every father prays
for his children to grow up.

98
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,650
But I...

99
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,990
I am an unlucky
father who wishes that..

100
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,440
..there shouldn't be any
marriage ceremony in this house.

101
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,480
Because of that
accursed palace!

102
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,940
So finally you come,
your lordship!

103
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,360
And I've only been
waiting an hour.

104
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,120
What are you staring at?

105
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,330
Just one close up.

106
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,010
You're getting obsessed
about your close-ups!

107
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,920
Naughty boy! Let me go...

108
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,630
I don't blame you.

109
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,420
I wouldn't mind some
of that myself.

110
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,340
Hey, dude!
You're cruising for a bruising.

111
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,780
But why are you still
just taking pics?

112
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,290
What's your problem?

113
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,870
Her father.

114
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,970
Doesn't he know about you two?

115
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,350
Not yet.

116
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,220
So you're still only dreaming?

117
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,230
Get a move on, chum.

118
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,480
Or you'll wake up
and find yourself alone in bed.

119
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,690
Here's the dream girl.

120
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,050
How's Sapna?

121
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,020
What are you gossiping about?

122
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,910
He was telling me
about his bed.

123
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,830
Bed? I don't get it...

124
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,360
I'll explain later.

125
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,360
Hey Anand, coming to
the club this evening?

126
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,790
Yes Anand, and bring Sapna.

127
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,650
- I don't know...
- Why not?

128
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,110
I'll have a show
of my own to watch.

129
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,350
I am already 45 minutes late.

130
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,500
The first question will be:

131
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,790
Where've you been?

132
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,400
What were you doing?
Who with?

133
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,930
<i>I'm young and lonely.</i>

134
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,780
<i>You don't know
how lost I am.</i>

135
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,900
<i>Thousands fawn on me
but even so I'm lonely.</i>

136
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,230
<i>Yes me, yes me.</i>

137
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,370
<i>The moon and
stars in my eyes</i>

138
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,020
<i>who knows who
they call today?</i>

139
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,860
<i>Somebody please
read their signs</i>

140
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,300
<i>and come and bring
me joy and more.</i>

141
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:21,640
<i>Become my...
oh, become my lover, lover.</i>

142
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,350
<i>The business of the heart,
only the heart understands.</i>

143
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,250
<i>What can you or
I do about it?</i>

144
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,690
<i>What is a dream and what is the truth?
Who will know that here?</i>

145
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,010
<i>Live for the moment,
oh live for the moment, lover.</i>

146
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,370
Papa, I'm back.

147
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,960
Sorry I'm late again.

148
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,510
I met my old girlfriend Nikki
and she insisted I go back with her.

149
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,220
And her parents asked
me to stay for a while.

150
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,880
They insisted that I have
dinner with them.

151
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,690
Papa, have you eaten?

152
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,880
Who is this boy?

153
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,490
It's Sanjay, papa.

154
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,950
He's a really nice boy.

155
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,560
- If you met him...
- You'll not see him again.

156
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,160
Please meet him just once.
He's from a respectable family.

157
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,590
Please
meet him once.

158
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,580
Ranbir Singh's family blood
has not become so thin...

159
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,330
...that it can flow away
in the gutters.

160
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,930
I knew it, Suman...

161
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,370
I knew that your father's money
would be a wall between us.

162
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,150
Even so Sanjay, why won't you
meet Papa one day?

163
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm sure if he met you,
all these problems would be solved.

164
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,710
No, Suman.

165
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,070
He'd just reject me
because I'm poor.

166
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,140
So now I see how my own blood
wants to shame me.

167
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,790
And how this man is now
my mortal enemy.

168
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,740
You fool...

169
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,640
If you burn palace lamps
in a hovel...

170
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,480
...you won't get light,
you'll burn the hovel down.

171
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,420
But if there's a fire,
the must be some light.

172
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,800
Not for long.

173
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,250
In a poor man's life,
even a brief light is worth much.

174
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Today's love is not love,
it's just the fever of youth.

175
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,600
How much?

176
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,700
How much money do you want,
to leave my daughter alone?

177
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,690
Sorry, sir...

178
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,890
...true love
can't be bought and sold.

179
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,510
You blacken
our good family name...

180
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,470
...and now you argue with me!

181
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,940
Teach him respect!

182
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,150
Let him go, papa.
Please!

183
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,320
Stay off my friend!

184
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,650
Come you bastard dogs,
where are you running off to?

185
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,050
We showed 'em.

186
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,250
I don't understand.

187
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,010
If Suman wants you,
what's his problem?

188
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,850
The problem's always been there,
and it always will be.

189
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,530
I cannot ignore the heritage
of this family.

190
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,700
But what about
your daughter's wishes?

191
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,500
This child's tears
are not something that I want...

192
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,570
...but that vagabond will
take her away from me forever.

193
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,510
But I won't let that happen.

194
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,870
I won't even let his shadow
fall on her again.

195
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,130
Why can't you make
this girl understand, Dayawanti.

196
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,170
Make her understand,
or I dread the consequences.

197
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,370
Who... Who are you?

198
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,230
I am asking you, who are you...

199
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,610
...that has for centuries cast
a shadow of death on this family?

200
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,310
How much more blood must flow?
How many more will you kill?

201
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,680
How many more lives?

202
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,300
You can't kill her. You can't ever
take my child away from me.

203
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,660
Papa what happened?

204
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,370
Nothing, just go back
to your room.

205
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,900
After today you will
never meet Sanjay again.

206
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,120
And if he tries to see you,
I will have him killed.

207
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,240
Don't just stand there,
get out of here.

208
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:59,960
<i>Those gone days I remember.
Those stolen moments I recall.</i>

209
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,990
<i>The ones I spent with you,
warm in your embrace.</i>

210
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:23,990
<i>That smile of yours, your blushes,
the time of December, the wet cold.</i>

211
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>What happened to those days,
where did they all go?</i>

212
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:38,420
<i>Only the memories remain.</i>

213
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,780
<i>Those talks I remember,
the nights I remember.</i>

214
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:11,160
<i>Spent with you,
holding you close.</i>

215
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,620
<i>Wrapping yourself around me,
lowering your eyelids.</i>

216
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,800
<i>Still in my heart remains
the softness of your lips.</i>

217
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,460
<i>Now you've started a fire.</i>

218
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:41,870
<i>I wonder where you've gone.
Only the memories remain.</i>

219
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,660
Suman, I love you.

220
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,860
Driver, let's go.

221
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,910
<i>Something is
happening to me...</i>

222
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,010
<i>I don't want to die...!</i>

223
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,570
<i>Save me!
Please, save me...!</i>

224
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,460
Come, Suman.

225
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,330
I return your family's
honor to you, sir.

226
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,690
If I wanted I could have made
your lamp the light of my hut...

227
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,080
But I feared that this flame might
have burnt down your palace.

228
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm going.

229
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,840
Wait!

230
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,290
You may as well take this gun...

231
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,980
...and shoot both her and me.

232
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,230
What?

233
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:57,840
I am not upset about my defeat,
I am upset at your victory.

234
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,610
Because you will run from her
once you know the truth.

235
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,680
The truth?
What truth, papa?

236
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,220
It's... It's a secret.

237
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,340
What kind of secret?

238
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,090
One I can't reveal.

239
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,880
But you must reveal it.

240
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,840
No, I can't tell you!
I can't tell you...

241
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:31,920
This secret is a curse that has
cast the shadow of death on our family.

242
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,970
What kind of curse is it,
to become a wall between our love?

243
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,420
You have to reveal it Papa,
my happiness depends on it.

244
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,640
Please tell us.

245
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,100
All right...

246
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,400
Alright, if you really
want to know...

247
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,900
So be it.

248
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,420
Do you see that palace?

249
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,400
That building is such a cursed
stain on our family...

250
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,440
...that we could
not wash it away...

251
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,120
...even with our own blood.

252
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,790
Every mother, every woman
connected with this building...

253
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,450
...on the birth of her first baby
becomes the immediate prey of death.

254
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,420
Papa, this is just
a superstition.

255
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,420
It is not a superstition,
it's the truth.

256
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,190
But, sir...

257
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,820
Can you really believe such things,
in this day and age?

258
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,980
Look...

259
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,500
I don't believe in things
that people tell me.

260
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,190
But I've seen this
with my own eyes!

261
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,640
The day Suman was born...

262
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:04,020
...this curse... took away
her mother Bharti from us.

263
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,780
Something's happening to me!
- Are you okay?

264
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,230
Something is happening to me!
I don't want to die...!

265
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,340
What's wrong?

266
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,610
I don't know, sir...

267
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,080
- I can't understand...
- What's happened to Bharti?

268
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,440
Go and look!

269
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,830
What's wrong?

270
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:33,050
If, after knowing all this,
you don't leave Suman alone...

271
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,350
...then I know that you don't
love her but are her mortal enemy.

272
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,250
So you walked out on her?
You loser.

273
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,240
What'll she think of you now?

274
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,840
You don't understand Anand.
I really do love Suman.

275
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,920
I can't live without her.
Do you hear me? I can't live without her.

276
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,220
- But if you'd heard that story...
- It's nonsense...

277
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,850
Just a made up story.

278
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,560
Suman...
What are you doing here?

279
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,220
Sanjay...

280
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,980
We must go to Bijapur.

281
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,030
Yes, to the old temple
that's the root of all our problems.

282
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,040
No, Suman...

283
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,040
It's better that
you forget all about me.

284
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,040
For the sake of my love, I'm not
prepared to sacrifice your life.

285
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,180
While I'm alive,
nothing will happen to Suman.

286
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,650
I am here for you.

287
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,850
And if it comes to it,
my life is yours.

288
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,420
You'll come with us?

289
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,750
Not only me,
but Sapna as well.

290
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,150
She'll be company
for Suman.

291
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,960
- Does your father know...?
- No...

292
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,010
I didn't tell him...

293
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,860
But I left a letter for him.

294
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,520
Brother...!

295
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,060
Terrible news...

296
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,760
- Suman is not in her room!
- What...?

297
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,900
But I found this letter there.

298
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,780
<i>Father, I cannot live
without Sanjay.</i>

299
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,710
<i>If this family curse is
the barrier to our love...</i>

300
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,100
<i>...then we will return
only after destroying it.</i>

301
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,180
<i>We are going to Bijapur.</i>

302
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,110
<i>To the old palace.</i>

303
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,050
<i>Suman.</i>

304
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,520
I still say you should go back, Anand.
This is our problem.

305
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,230
Why risk your life for us?

306
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,290
You're asking for a thump,
my old mate.

307
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,880
A friend is one who gives
his own life if need be.

308
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:16,160
If there's a shadow on our family,
why should we allow it to fall on you?

309
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,730
It's no shadow...

310
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,600
It's in your father's mind,
now it's got into your head too.

311
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,580
Hey, why did you stop the car?

312
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,970
What is it?

313
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,630
The tyre is punctured.

314
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,470
See mate,
you need me after all!

315
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,990
If we start getting
troubles so soon..

316
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,110
...we might reach Bijapur
in the next life!

317
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,360
Why did this problem
have to arise now?

318
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,770
We're dead.

319
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,020
Why's that?

320
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,490
I forgot the jack.

321
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,840
I don't believe it!

322
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,550
Don't worry my king!
What do you think I'm here for?

323
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,910
You just deal with the tire,
and I'll be the jack.

324
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,410
<i>Ranbir Singh!
Now it's your daughter's time!</i>

325
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,080
<i>She will suffer the same fate
as your wife.</i>

326
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,400
No! You can't do that...!

327
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,580
Dayawanti!

328
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,650
Take it away.

329
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,630
I'm afraid he's had
a heart attack.

330
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,030
He needs a lot of rest.

331
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,130
In his condition he can't make
the long trip to Bijapur.

332
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,500
This temple looks pretty old.

333
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,660
Indeed.

334
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,230
I don't feel like driving any more.
Why don't we stay here?

335
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,350
Alright, Suman?

336
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
Yes Sanjay,
I agree with Anand.

337
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,920
Besides, we're all dead tired.

338
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,280
Looks like there's no priest
staying at this temple.

339
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,500
How would he, Anand?

340
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,540
Is it a joke to climb up and
down 200 steps every day?

341
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,430
It may be for you,
but not for me.

342
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,150
Hail to the Lord!

343
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,790
Look, Anand, this is odd.

344
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,690
What?

345
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,560
This Shiva has
no trident in his hand.

346
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,450
Right!

347
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,930
Who would look after this temple
if there's no priest here?

348
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,960
Right mate, now we've met God,
lets go and meet the saint.

349
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,080
What saint?

350
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,370
Saint Food!
I'm starving.

351
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,910
Mice are doing a dance
in my stomach.

352
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,670
Suman...!
What are you doing here?

353
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,000
Why don't you speak?
What happened?

354
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,740
It was...

355
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,440
I saw...

356
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,950
What did you see?

357
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,830
I saw a corpse, Sanjay...

358
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,360
With no head...!

359
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,990
It was coming at me.

360
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,100
Sanjay it wanted to kill me.

361
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,990
You're talking crazy.

362
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,500
Sanjay...
I heard strange noises.

363
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,000
Strange noises.

364
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,680
A walking corpse,
and without a head too!

365
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,140
There's nothing here.

366
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,440
You're tired and
had a bad dream.

367
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,960
That man seems to be
belonging to this place....

368
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,380
He must know the old palace.

369
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,500
- I'll be right back.
- I'm coming. - Come back soon.

370
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,430
Excuse me...

371
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,240
Do you know
the way to Bijapur?

372
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,750
The palace at Bijapur.
Thakur Man Singh's palace.

373
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,860
Do you know the way, sir?

374
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,690
What happened?

375
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:23,810
Strange man.

376
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,330
He was waving that axe
like he wanted to cut my throat!

377
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,120
Looks deserted to me.

378
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,220
There must be a watchman about.

379
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,100
- You two stay here.
- OK.

380
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,160
We'll be back.

381
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,630
Watchman! Gardener!

382
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,910
Anyone here?

383
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,600
I just saw a light over there.

384
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,190
- Where?
- Over there.

385
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,390
Can't see anyone.

386
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,460
Let's go.

387
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,220
What is it?

388
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,190
There's someone by the car.

389
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,500
Anand, ask her who she is.

390
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,830
Who are you?

391
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,680
Why don't you answer?

392
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,110
She is dumb.

393
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,910
My mother...
Mangli.

394
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,690
So who are you?
Where is the watchman?

395
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,210
I am Durjan,
the watchman of this place.

396
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,950
Who are you?

397
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,450
We're from Bombay.

398
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,150
She's Suman,
daughter of Ranbir Singh.

399
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,410
We are honored.

400
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,920
After many years, someone
from the family has returned.

401
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,820
Come, come inside.

402
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,210
This is the palace of your
grandfather, Raja Pratap Singh.

403
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,260
This is your grandfather's
picture, Raja Pratap Singh.

404
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,890
And this is your great grandfather's
picture, Raja Ajit Singh...

405
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,390
This is all very fascinating...

406
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,870
But I really need sleep.

407
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,040
I'm sleepy too.

408
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,510
And here is Hari Man Singh,
your grandfather's, grandfather.

409
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,570
What's up?

410
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,680
I feel drawn towards
that painting...

411
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,580
Like he's trying
to tell me something.

412
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,610
Really?

413
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,890
Come.

414
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,830
Come on, Suman.

415
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,710
Have a good night?

416
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,950
Great fun.

417
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,320
Lying on the royal bed
I dreamt royal dreams all night long.

418
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:02,570
Me king of kings and Sapna
my queen of beauty.

419
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,560
Suman! What is it?

420
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,090
You!
Why are you here?

421
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,050
Food!

422
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,180
It must be cooked.

423
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,440
Oven must be lit.

424
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,440
Durjan called me, so I came.

425
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,980
What's wrong, boss?

426
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,850
Did you ask that man to come?

427
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,320
Why?

428
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,940
Without wood how will we cook?

429
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,960
And only Sangha brings
wood for the village.

430
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,160
Don't ask him here again,
understand?

431
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:07,810
Let's go.

432
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:22,400
6... 7... 8...

433
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,690
What a beautiful lake!
What a lovely place!

434
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,090
And in such a place...

435
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,790
...instead of talking love,
the fool is working out!

436
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,600
Do you have to do that?

437
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,230
Take a break.

438
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,270
Now stop it or I'm going.

439
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,570
I'm coming, miss.

440
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,360
So, what's up?

441
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,710
Nothing at all.

442
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
If you come any closer...

443
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,030
...I might melt
like candle wax.

444
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,790
Until only the wick is left.

445
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,740
You just don't understand.

446
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,680
These days it's really important
to keep the body fit.

447
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,370
Always thinking of your body,
never of me!

448
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,460
If I think about you,
the Indian population might explode.

449
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,440
What kind of talk's that?!

450
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,010
- I'm off.
- Where?

451
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,890
To Hell.

452
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,160
This is a jungle, not hell,
some bear will eat you.

453
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,410
Big deal.

454
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,290
More fun than watching you
do press-ups.

455
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,470
OK, go then, go on...

456
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,410
Just remember to
call if you need me.

457
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:20,334
<b><i>Synced by Anomix33</i></b>

458
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,530
Let me go!

459
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,930
Sons of mice!!
How many men were they?

460
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,850
I am asking you -
how many were they?

461
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,130
Just one, sire.

462
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,210
Him, one man!
And six of you!

463
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,640
Yet you return
without the girl!

464
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:14,530
Shame on you!
Sons of pigs...!!

465
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,460
So tell me, how much reward...

466
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,660
...has the Sardar
put on my head?

467
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:32,520
15,000 rupees...!
15,000!

468
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,720
Now you've made my name mud!

469
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:48,780
But punishment will come...
It will certainly come.

470
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,260
People are killed by bullets.

471
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,000
But I am going to kill you
by making you eat bullets!

472
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,120
Give me a hand.
You fell down yourself.

473
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,920
Come on, get up.

474
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,790
I am going to kill you
by feeding you bullets.

475
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,100
What will I do?
Feed you bullets!

476
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,610
But these are laxative pills.

477
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,640
Last year, we gave two pills
to twelve people each.

478
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,850
They are still wandering
the jungle with their pots!

479
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,940
Clever, very clever.

480
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,880
That is all very well sir,
but what will come of Murtar Singh?

481
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,900
Murtar Singh?

482
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:39,210
You have grown old,
but still you sway.

483
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:45,900
A lot of strength in your legs,
a lot of strength in the legs.

484
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:52,930
Give me Murtar's Singh's legs!
Bring me his legs!!

485
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,780
Sardar why are you having studs
put in your shoes?

486
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,290
To squash Machar Singh.

487
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,590
He cut off my arms.

488
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,880
My name is Murtar Singh.

489
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,390
He has woken the
flame of revenge in me.

490
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:24,240
I will beat him
with my studded shoes.

491
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,620
Machar!
Give me those hands!

492
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,470
Your hands!

493
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,460
Sardar, I have been
robbed, destroyed.

494
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,380
What's wrong, Basanti?

495
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,950
How can I tell you?
I'm too ashamed to tell you.

496
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:03,020
If you're too ashamed to tell me,
I won't be able to do justice.

497
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,850
That scoundrel,
he dishonoured me.

498
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,870
You mean rape!

499
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,100
And this is the second time.

500
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,890
Who was it this time?

501
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,420
Who else in this village
except that rogue Machar?

502
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,820
Stung by Machar a second time!

503
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:28,200
Sardar if he does it again,
we'll have a malaria epidemic!

504
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,280
There'll be no epidemic.

505
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,350
We'll spray DDT.

506
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,510
We will kill Machar
with insecticide.

507
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,260
Increase the
reward by one rupee!

508
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,590
Shall I lay the table?

509
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:01,830
Please.

510
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:09,640
Durjan... What do you
know about this palace?

511
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,300
It's a mysterious place, sire.

512
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:23,430
I've heard stories about it
from my father and grandfather.

513
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,790
In the time of Hari Man Singh
there was a dreadful incident...

514
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,390
...which still casts a
shadow over this palace.

515
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,480
The tribals believe...

516
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,800
there's a link between this palace
and the ancient temple of Palighat.

517
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,150
You...?

518
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,130
Here...?

519
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,920
Put it down and go.

520
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:08,840
Those town folk were asking
questions about the palace.

521
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,550
What do you think
they're looking for?

522
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,050
I know everything.

523
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,620
Everything...!

524
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:24,580
They have come to find the treasure
that's buried here somewhere.

525
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,900
Whenever I mention the treasure,
your mother goes crazy.

526
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,350
My mother knows a lot
about this old palace.

527
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,960
But she can't tell us,
because she is dumb.

528
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:47,620
But I have told you many times,
there's treasure in this palace, there is.

529
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,460
What makes you so certain
there's anything here?

530
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:53,890
If there was no treasure...

531
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:58,440
...why would they come
to this lonely, desolate place?

532
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,900
Let's take a photo of you two.

533
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:09,580
It's not a passport type photo.
Give a romantic pose.

534
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,400
Like this?

535
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,970
I'm too embarrassed
to look in the camera.

536
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,660
Mate, have you hooked one yet?

537
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:25,380
The fish here are too clever,
they don't want to bite.

538
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,580
What's she saying?

539
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,830
I think she's saying,
she'll catch the fish for you.

540
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,260
- How'll she do that?
- She's gone.

541
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,440
Now you're for it.

542
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,660
Let's go.

543
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:16,050
We don't need these fish,
we can go to the market.

544
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:22,130
- "I am hungry, bring me food,
food, FOOD..." - Shut up!

545
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,690
Is this a fish or a crocodile?

546
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,700
Suman has brought this crocodile
from the market...

547
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,500
...to put you off going
fishing for yourself!

548
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,150
Anand, the female race
are always suspicious.

549
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,110
Rightly so.

550
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,330
Suman come down,
the food is getting cold.

551
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,310
Take those photos later.

552
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,820
Coming...!

553
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,420
That was the last photo.

554
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,550
What's wrong?

555
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,430
The picture...

556
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,990
What's wrong with it?

557
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,810
Nothing at all.

558
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,680
Suman, the food's getting cold.

559
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:30,480
What is it?

560
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:34,510
That painting...

561
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,620
I saw a horrible face.

562
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,970
His head was cut off
and blood dripping from his neck.

563
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,220
You're amazing, Suman!

564
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,810
In the temple
you saw a body with no head.

565
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:52,620
And here you see a head
with no body.

566
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,370
A pretty good tale!

567
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,530
Don't you believe me?

568
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,500
Come on, let's go and eat.

569
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,160
Who's sitting on this donkey?

570
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:17,200
It's not a donkey,
it's a race horse.

571
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,500
There's a 15,000 rupee reward
on his head.

572
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,740
And you'll catch him?

573
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,640
Of course.

574
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,070
After coming all this way,
might as well make some dough.

575
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,900
Watch, in two days I will grab
this ass from his donkey.

576
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:40,940
<i>On the river bank,
Nandlal teases me.</i>

577
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,560
It's Basanti...!

578
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:56,390
Oh, God!

579
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:06,920
The pot is broken!
Broken!

580
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,180
Let me go.
I beg you, let me go.

581
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,200
Do you beg of me,
or wink at me?

582
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,640
I won't do anything to you today.
I won't even touch you.

583
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,260
See, I have let you go.

584
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,590
But I will watch you dance.

585
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,200
Dance?
I don't know how to dance.

586
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:33,230
Listen doll, don't try to be
clever with me. Come on, dance!

587
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:38,240
What is this? Is this an arm
or an elephant's trunk?

588
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,270
Let me breathe!

589
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:43,390
I can breathe! I can breathe now!

590
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,400
Come with me. - Where?

591
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:52,000
I'm taking you
to Sardar, Machar Singh.

592
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,180
I will turn you in
and get the 15,000 reward.

593
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,170
But what will I get?

594
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,020
A rope around your neck.

595
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,880
Bring the bastard here.

596
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:15,490
I have come of
my own free will...

597
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,680
Machar Singh!

598
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,080
- Yes, cripple...?
- You've committed terrible crimes.

599
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:34,060
But some fun ones too!
Isn't that true, Basanti?

600
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,450
You abandoned the young
and nubile village girls.

601
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,530
Broke their hearts.

602
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,830
Turned your face from them.

603
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,430
And formed a relationship
with 70 year old Basanti!

604
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,500
Whether Basanti is 70 or 16...

605
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:58,640
...in the country where Ganges flows
she'll always be moist.

606
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:04,400
You're about to be hung,
so stop beating about the bush.

607
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:10,700
I am beating about the bush,
but I'm not beating anything else, am I?

608
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,270
I will beat you so much
that your love engine will shut down.

609
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,890
Take him off
to the gallows now!

610
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,130
Who are you to force me
up the gallows?

611
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,250
I'll go by myself.

612
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:29,510
There's no gallows in the world
strong enough to hang me!

613
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:30,550
Stop, baldie!

614
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,490
I was having a conversation,
how did you get in the middle?

615
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,890
Wait for me, Basanti!

616
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,070
He's run away!

617
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,730
And so should you.

618
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,610
When I catch him again...

619
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:51,980
...I'll stamp on both your bodies
with my studded shoes.

620
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:56,300
Who are you?
Think you're Sunny Deol?

621
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:07,850
I was really angry with that man.
I was going to wring his neck.

622
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,680
Who are you, my saviour?

623
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,910
Please remove your hood.
Show me your face.

624
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,420
You! You arrested me
and now you...

625
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,860
And now I freed you.

626
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,750
Why?

627
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,800
It's a business, mate.

628
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:25,870
What kind of business?
Let me hear it as well.

629
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,940
Look, I capture you
and get the reward...

630
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:35,920
...free you, capture you again,
get another reward and so on.

631
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,850
And what about my share
of this reward?

632
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,450
25 per cent is my best offer.

633
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,250
And 75 percent to you?

634
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,390
Shall I take you to Sardar?

635
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,570
Who'll save you then?

636
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,590
You drive a hard bargain.

637
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,550
Agree or not?

638
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,470
75 percent...
That seems very fair.

639
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:58,320
I mean, 25 percent.
Alright. I agree, I agree...

640
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,910
Now you're being sensible.
Here's your share.

641
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,400
What happened?

642
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,120
Open the door.

643
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,500
That demon wants to kill me...!
Get me away from here...!!

644
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,870
No, Suman. No.

645
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,570
We came to Bijapur
to prove something.

646
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,140
There is no evil curse.

647
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,440
It's just a trick
to scare us off.

648
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,220
Who's responsible for this?

649
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,230
Answer me.

650
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:17,810
Answer me.

651
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,920
Answer me, Durjan!

652
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,600
You can't deny what
your own eyes see, master.

653
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:28,500
This is not a trick by a human
but a manifestation of a demon.

654
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:32,170
If you really want
to understand this...

655
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,280
...you must ask
the villagers to help.

656
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,170
Bijli, I need to talk to you...
But you must put some clothes on.

657
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,110
I understand Hindi,
these ARE my clothes.

658
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,440
Come and get me.

659
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,330
Will you stay with me?
I want to keep you.

660
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,840
Keep...? But first you...

661
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:26,860
Is this what you came
all the way from Bombay for?

662
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,160
It's very important
that I talk with Bijli.

663
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,110
At least now I know
what's important to you.

664
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:37,260
Are you coming with me
or staying with this jungle slut?

665
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,490
Suman, I told you,
it's important that I talk to Bijli.

666
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:46,950
Then she's obviously
much more important to you...

667
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:48,940
...than me!

668
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:55,950
Let's go, Bijli.

669
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,300
Enough Bijli...
I can't drink any more.

670
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,000
I was already drunk
from your lovely eyes.

671
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,570
You have only drunk
from my eyes...

672
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,430
When your lips
are pressed against my lips...

673
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,200
...then your body will
really catch fire.

674
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:24,690
<i>I remember
those bygone days.</i>

675
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,520
<i>Those stolen moments...</i>

676
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:36,600
<i>...spent with you,
hugged against my body.</i>

677
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:52,440
<i>In your arms I cuddled,
you wrapped up in my hair.</i>

678
01:18:52,690 --> 01:19:07,260
<i>Time has taken all but memories.
Why have the dreams shattered?</i>

679
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:39,950
<i>That past life, our happiness,
romantic places, time of desires.</i>

680
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:47,500
<i>Our tormented hearts,
the pounding heart beats.</i>

681
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:55,310
<i>The songs we hummed.</i>

682
01:19:56,210 --> 01:20:10,380
<i>They are lost, gone with the wind.
Why have the dreams shattered?</i>

683
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,390
Come along.

684
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:24,360
Stop right there!

685
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:33,230
If you don't, then I swear by Kali
this knife will go through you.

686
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,450
Don't, it's my brother.

687
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,250
How do you dare touch the hand
of Raka's sister?

688
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,640
Bijli? Who is this boy?

689
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,120
This is Sanjay.

690
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,830
He wants to ask us
about the palace and old temple.

691
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,190
Stay away from that palace
and the old temple...

692
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,950
...or be lost forever
in the darkness of death.

693
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:08,260
Death's darkness can't stop me
from reaching my goal.

694
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,550
What goal?

695
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,250
Your goal means the destruction
of our village and our tribe.

696
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,890
200 years ago an abomination
was buried in that ground.

697
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,340
You want to raise it!
To destroy it!

698
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:25,230
No...

699
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,600
City boy...

700
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:34,310
Go back to your city
and never come here again.

701
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:39,430
Or I swear by the goddess Kali,
I will slit your throat.

702
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,780
You don't scare me.

703
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,390
But keep your knife sharp...

704
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:49,610
...it might be handy
for cutting vegetables.

705
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:02,250
Oh Suman, did you really think
that I had left you for that wild girl?

706
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,380
Why don't you understand?

707
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,450
It was to find out
the secrets of the palace.

708
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,430
It was just
a show for the tribals.

709
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,370
Honestly?

710
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,620
I swear...

711
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,270
Now do I get a smile?

712
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,420
Just a little one...?
Just for me...?

713
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:43,600
I was getting some enjoyment,
now even that has gone.

714
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:50,500
You dried up old fruit, are you
giving a massage or polishing me?

715
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,000
- Am I some shoe?
- No.

716
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,060
I am Machar Singh, my back
is built like a brick wall.

717
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:01,740
So give me a hard slap.

718
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:11,210
A clap, was it a clap?
No, it was a gunshot. I'm off!

719
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:23,250
You guys got afraid for nothing.
He's one of ours.

720
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,580
Hey friend! What news?

721
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,510
The news is good.
The reward's been doubled.

722
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:34,930
Really?

723
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,650
But this time
you won't be hung.

724
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,140
What will they do?

725
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,060
Your punishment's been changed.

726
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:42,960
To what?

727
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:46,600
This time you will be put
in a live bear's cage.

728
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:51,690
That's great news, I haven't seen
a live bear for ages.

729
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:53,390
A live bear!

730
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,280
I'll be torn
to shreds in that cage.

731
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:01,680
You'd better come up
with a good plan.

732
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,890
Why, are you scared?

733
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,160
It won't be a real bear.

734
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:10,700
Inside the bear skin will be
your very good friend.

735
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:20,010
You're a true magician,
just like a sheep in wolf's clothing.

736
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:25,740
And I will stand in front of you,
puff out my chest and say...

737
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:31,820
Murtar Singh, you are
a dead man, for sure.

738
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,190
Surrounding me with spears.

739
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:39,180
Putting me in the bear cage,
you're trying to kill me.

740
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:51,250
Hey Blackie, you open your ears
and listen to me too.

741
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,730
You think you're safe
inside that cage.

742
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:59,240
But as soon as you come out,
I'll make kebabs of you...

743
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,640
...and sell them
at the train station.

744
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,910
Idiot, it's Anand.

745
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,510
So, you're Anand.

746
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:12,690
And this is a real bear.

747
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,280
I'm real too.

748
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,430
I couldn't find a bear skin.

749
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,120
Couldn't find a skin?

750
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,570
Sardar, he's run off again.

751
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,390
You'd better run off too!

752
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,970
Injustice has been done to me.

753
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:40,620
Machar Singh has run away.

754
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:43,880
I belong neither
there nor here.

755
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:45,460
Don't worry.

756
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:51,700
I will do Emperor Jehangir
type of justice.

757
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,800
Even Jehangir will come
to seek my forgiveness.

758
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,550
I will marry you.

759
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:01,420
Marriage? With you?

760
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:04,910
- Both your hands
have been cut off. - So?

761
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,380
It's only the hands.

762
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,900
Who needs hands to marry?

763
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,910
After marriage, we will fly
to London for the honeymoon...

764
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,240
Air India.

765
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,640
I'll get new hands made there.

766
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,440
That's very funny!

767
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,910
My teeth are false too,
I will get new ones made there.

768
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:30,250
And one more thing, I'm bald,
so I'll get a new wig there too.

769
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,740
Who's there?

770
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,300
Who is it?

771
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,060
I'll kill you...

772
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,460
Kill you!...KILL YOU!

773
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,950
Let me go! I'll kill him!

774
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:57,810
Who will you kill?

775
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:58,920
That painting.

776
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:03,080
I keep telling you,
there's nothing in that painting.

777
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:04,660
Have you gone mad?

778
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,070
Come with me.

779
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,330
Oh my foot.

780
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:36,400
Come on, Anand.

781
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,770
Have you gone nuts like Suman?

782
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,150
How can a painting bleed?

783
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,590
You saw the blood
on Suman's hand?

784
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,290
She had no cuts.

785
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:52,360
- Some sort of trick.
- And that crack behind the picture?

786
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:54,510
Another trick?

787
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,270
A crack?

788
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:58,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

789
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,930
There's an opening
behind the painting.

790
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:05,290
And it must lead to somewhere
or something.

791
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,710
You check that side...
and I'll look over here.

792
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,460
There's nothing here.

793
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,030
Find anything?

794
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,790
No.

795
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:38,260
A strange place.

796
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:41,620
No-one's been here for years.

797
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:45,620
Over there.

798
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:57,570
A trident?

799
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,660
Anand...
What could be in that box?

800
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:08,800
Open it.

801
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:19,200
I told you there
was treasure here.

802
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,950
It's a... severed head!

803
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,990
Maybe some brave soldier's.

804
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:43,620
The king must have kept
it securely in memoriam.

805
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:53,450
Tomorrow we'll get Durjan
to have this area bricked up again.

806
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:03,080
They'll be back
to take the treasure.

807
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:06,590
- Let's take it now.
- Not yet.

808
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,490
Why?

809
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:09,250
Tonight...

810
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:13,440
...when they're asleep
I will get my cart...

811
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,510
...and wait behind
the back door of the palace.

812
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,650
And you can bring
the treasure there.

813
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,660
Right... Right...

814
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:26,850
Let's go and wait
for the lights to go out.

815
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,240
Do it gently! It hurts.

816
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,030
It's a sprain.

817
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:40,480
She'll have to stay in bed
for at least 2-3 days.

818
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:43,450
No walking or moving at all.

819
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,610
Look here.

820
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,680
Now Suman will be able
to get around.

821
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:51,390
I found this
wheelchair downstairs.

822
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:58,050
It's getting late.
We should try to get some rest.

823
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,840
No! No, Sangha. No!!

824
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,150
Stop!

825
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:16,350
No...

826
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:18,340
Bastard...! Stop!!

827
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:26,330
You've killed my mother!
I won't let you live...!

828
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:31,740
I won't let you open the box,
I won't let you have the treasure!

829
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:55,390
Master...! It's a calamity!
A calamity, master...!! Master!!

830
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:56,680
What's up, Durjan?

831
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,150
Why are you shouting so much?

832
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,450
Master, you must stop Sangha!

833
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:04,900
He has taken the head and run off
towards the old temple.

834
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:10,600
Stop him master, come quickly.

835
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:19,910
But, Durjan, why did Sangha
take the head to the temple?

836
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:24,260
If that demon Saamri's head
was found in this palace...

837
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:28,290
...then his body must have been
buried near the old temple.

838
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:32,860
If the head and body are joined
then the demon will come alive again.

839
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,410
Master, go and stop Sangha. Go!

840
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:05,290
Faster! Faster!

841
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,400
Stop, Sangha!

842
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,340
Where's she gone?

843
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:18,740
Durjan, where is Sapna?

844
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:22,170
She was here.

845
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,530
What's that noise?

846
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,420
Don't be afraid.

847
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:42,080
I'll be right back.

848
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:46,870
But first I'd better go and close
the main palace gates.

849
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,990
Anand, let's check the ruins.

850
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:21,760
Anand - coffin.

851
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:31,710
What happened?

852
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:33,860
Yes I am Anand,
what happened?

853
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:35,090
- Anand, he was here...
- Who was here?

854
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:36,570
- Anand he wants to kill me.
- Who wants to kill you?

855
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,910
What happened here?
Where's Sapna?

856
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:43,590
Sapna's, gone.
I don't know where she is.

857
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,370
What happened?

858
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:57,410
Stop Sapna!

859
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,550
Don't take another step.

860
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:05,670
Don't go near
the demon, Sapna!

861
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:48,480
Saamri!!

862
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:15,720
I'm not afraid of dying!

863
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,710
Show yourself, damn you!

864
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:23,230
You won't get away from me!

865
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:01,280
Sapna...
What's going on, Sapna?

866
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:35,720
What is it?
What's wrong?

867
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:37,790
You seem terrified...

868
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:43,300
I've just had a terrible dream!
A dreadful nightmare...

869
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:45,700
Dayawanti,
Suman's life is in danger!

870
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:48,990
I can't stay here.

871
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:51,850
I must go to Bijapur, today.

872
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:07,260
Now you've woken the demon
from his sleep of centuries.

873
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,520
There will be such a flood of death,
that all be washed away in it.

874
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:15,230
And you people
are responsible for it.

875
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:21,570
I swear by Goddess Bhadarkali, there's
only one way to escape this fate.

876
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:25,410
A blood sacrifice of you two
to Bhadarkali.

877
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:28,160
Hail Bhadarkali!

878
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:31,620
<i>The one that I was dying for,
he has to die today.</i>

879
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:36,490
<i>The faithless in love we must
settle their account today.</i>

880
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:41,500
<i>The one that I was dying for,
he has to die today.</i>

881
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:46,310
<i>The faithless in love,
we must settle their account today.</i>

882
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:51,100
<i>My love your life
it soon will end.</i>

883
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:56,190
<i>Death is going to fulfill
its revenge today.</i>

884
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:28,620
<i>The world changed with the fire
of rage. The moth is still alive.</i>

885
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,840
<i>It has to get burnt
while swaying.</i>

886
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:43,660
<i>This game is from births.</i>

887
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:40,590
<i>There are many dangers in
the path of love. Be careful.</i>

888
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:56,860
<i>Understand the gestures and
listen to me. Win or lose.</i>

889
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:23,480
Run away, mister!

890
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,750
Let him go.

891
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:39,650
I swear by Bhadarkali,
Raka will cut this girl into pieces.

892
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:49,090
With these hands I will sacrifice
her blood to the goddess.

893
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:56,450
If you want to save her,
then you must fight me.

894
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:54,400
Listen! I want
that city dog, dead or alive.

895
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:57,730
Let's search the jungle.
Come on!

896
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:23,910
Let's not stay here anymore.

897
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:29,190
Let's get out of here now.
Come on, let's go.

898
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:32,640
Yes, Suman but we have
to find Anand first.

899
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:36,700
He must be at the temple
looking for the demon.

900
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:38,850
Let's go.

901
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:50,690
Where is your friend?
Where have you hidden him?

902
01:58:52,230 --> 01:58:56,800
Where is my sister's killer?
Speak!

903
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:59,840
Let me go.
I don't know.

904
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:08,680
Speak bastard,
or I will skin you alive.

905
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,630
I said I don't know.

906
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,670
Now let me go,
I have a mission to kill.

907
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,520
And so do I,
as you'll find out.

908
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:25,670
Let go of me.

909
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:35,870
I said, let me go.
I said, LET ME GO!!

910
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,990
Hail Bhadarkali!

911
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,210
Before you can get to them,
you have to get past me!

912
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:29,540
Sanjay, get Suman out of here.
I'll deal with this.

913
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:32,120
Have you gone mad, Anand?
I can't leave you here.

914
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:33,400
Don't argue Sanjay!

915
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:37,570
This demon feeds off
the blood of Suman's family.

916
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:38,650
He'll kill her.

917
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:41,130
No! I can't leave you
to face this alone.

918
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,520
We live together
and die together.

919
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:46,750
Go! Go!
Suman's life is at stake!

920
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:48,930
Take her and get out of here!

921
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:51,490
Go! Go!

922
02:01:55,050 --> 02:01:56,570
Get Suman out of here!

923
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:56,420
<i>A friend is someone
who gives his own life if need be.</i>

924
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,910
Papa, look what's happened.

925
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:21,120
Anand sacrificed his life
to save us.

926
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:24,570
And the demon
killed Sapna too.

927
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:30,850
No man has the power to
combat this demon.

928
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:39,170
Only one mighty power can
destroy him and that is Lord Shiva.

929
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:48,070
Let's go and beg for our lives
from him.

930
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:57,420
<i>Shiv Shankar.
Shiv Shankar, simple one.</i>

931
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:21,730
<i>You are the one who gives life to all.
You are the mighty preserver.</i>

932
02:04:37,190 --> 02:04:48,860
<i>In the middle of the river,
you are the bank.</i>

933
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:54,430
<i>Your strength
created the two worlds.</i>

934
02:04:54,570 --> 02:05:02,240
<i>Oh creator of all, Shiv Shankar,
Shambo, Bholenath.</i>

935
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:17,660
<i>You are the giver, you are
the mother and father of all.</i>

936
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:23,140
<i>Your glory shines.</i>

937
02:05:49,320 --> 02:06:00,690
<i>Strong one, the strength of all,
your devotee calls you.</i>

938
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:32,990
<i>Open your eyes Lord,
give us your divine protection.</i>

939
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:38,950
<i>This is an old temple of yours,
we have surrounded it.</i>

940
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:44,860
<i>Where have you
lost your trident?</i>

941
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,460
<i>How can you have lost it
in front of the demon?</i>

942
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:12,000
<i>Speak mighty one,
speak God, speak.</i>

943
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,940
Suman, we need that trident.

944
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:35,810
- Trident?
- Yes, God Shankar's trident.

945
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:38,310
We can kill
this monster with it.

946
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:41,700
And I've seen it
in the palace.

947
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:43,940
Come.

948
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,960
It was here!

949
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,390
Suman, that trident was here!

950
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:32,840
Look there.

951
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:40,200
Suman, this coffin
was in the old temple.

952
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:41,540
The old temple?

953
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,930
Yes, but how did it get here?

954
02:08:59,010 --> 02:09:00,870
That trident must be here.

955
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,870
Somewhere in this palace.

956
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,680
Don't look in his eyes, Suman!

957
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:27,430
Suman! Don't look in his eyes!
Suman, no!!

958
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:57,120
What's that noise?

959
02:12:58,730 --> 02:12:59,490
We'll see.

960
02:13:00,330 --> 02:13:01,510
But the demon...?

961
02:13:02,890 --> 02:13:07,620
While God Shiva's trident is on it,
the demon can't leave the coffin.

962
02:13:08,490 --> 02:13:09,250
Let's go.

963
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,780
Burn it!
Turn this palace into ashes!

964
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:19,200
Let the demon burn
together with this evil palace!

965
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:21,380
People of Bijapur,
stop right there!

966
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,670
You can't burn
down this palace!

967
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:31,230
Give me...
just half an hour's grace.

968
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:37,250
And within that half hour,
in front of this palace...

969
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:44,640
...I myself will burn that demon
to ashes in front of your eyes.

970
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:49,730
And if you can't subdue the demon
within that time, then what?

971
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:52,290
Then go ahead
and burn it down.

972
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:03,010
Come villagers...

973
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:08,420
Come and burn this demon
in the village square!

974
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:52,770
Open it.

975
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,240
Open it!

976
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:02,940
Start the fire!

977
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:06,750
Let this demon burn.

978
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,900
Burn him!

979
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,330
Son, I am proud of you.

980
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:56,610
You have destroyed the curse
that has haunted our family...

981
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:58,620
...for 200 years!

982
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:13,250
God bless you. God bless you.
