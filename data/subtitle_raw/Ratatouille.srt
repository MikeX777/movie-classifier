Although each of the world's countries

And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

7

died shortly afterwards,

meant the loss of another star.

I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.

1367

And he's going to order something.

1368
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:52,628
Something from our menu.

1369
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:57,237
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.

EMILE: Just can't leave it alone,

1371

You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.

And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.

1374
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:09,654
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.

Can you suggest

- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?

1401

I asked a waiter

E GO: In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.

1563
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:06,285
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those

1564
01:35:06,388 --> 01:35:10,283
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.

1565
01:35:10,515 --> 01:35:15,666
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.

1566
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:22,441
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,

1567
01:35:22,547 --> 01:35:26,379
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful

1568
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:29,615
than our criticism designating it so.

1569
01:35:29,973 --> 01:35:33,934
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something

1570
01:35:34,036 --> 01:35:38,161
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.

1571
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:42,669
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.

1572
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:45,236
The new needs friends.

Last night,
I experienced something new,

1574
01:35:49,107 --> 01:35:53,867
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.

1575
01:35:54,069 --> 01:35:56,590
To say that both the meal
and its maker

1576
01:35:56,693 --> 01:36:00,042
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking

1577
01:36:00,151 --> 01:36:02,736
is a gross understatement.

1578
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:06,192
They have rocked me to my core.

1579
01:36:06,901 --> 01:36:10,217
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain

1580
01:36:10,326 --> 01:36:15,082
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."

1581
01:36:15,382 --> 01:36:21,328
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.

1582
01:36:21,622 --> 01:36:25,397
Not everyone
can become a great artist,

1583
01:36:25,494 --> 01:36:29,650
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.

1584
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:33,362
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins

1585
01:36:33,463 --> 01:36:37,172
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,

1586

who is, in this critic's opinion,

1587
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:44,144
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.

1588
