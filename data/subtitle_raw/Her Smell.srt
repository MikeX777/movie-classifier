Uh, Danny's saying
goodbye to people.

78

- She... She was...

79
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,055
Ah, I want her away from my
kid, okay? I want her away from my kid.

80
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,690
Now, is he gonna come
pick her up tonight

81
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,259
or am I supposed to? What's happening,
because I've gotta do that thing tomorrow

82
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,896
so you've gotta come pick her up
first thing in the AYEM, all right?

Ya-ema!

84

I mean, I don't know how
you can show yourself.

85
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,268
I assumed you worked it out
with him.

86
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,805
That's not true. That's not true.
I hadn't worked it out.

87

Come here.

93
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,162
What's his deal?

94
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,531
She calls him Ya-ema

95
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,899
but I think
his real name's Alvin.

96
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,637
I call him Sauron.

97
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,511
There she is.

98
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,817

100
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:33,092

101

from this place.

102

What is she doing here?

103
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,932
Can't you see this is
a fucking religious ceremony

104
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,200
you have zero respect for?

105
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:42,503
Good show tonight.

106
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,903
Liar. You didn't see it.

107
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:46,205
Don't call people liars,
Becky, unless you know...

108
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,709
Sorry, was anybody speaking
to you, Little Miss Tiffany?

109
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,911
Huh? Tiff-a-ny.Tiff-a-ny.

110
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:55,448
I can't believe you're raising our
daughter around a woman named Tiffany.

111
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,785
- You're an angel.
- It's true. It's true.

112
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,521
- Could you excuse us?
- Yes, excuse us, Tiff.

113
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,558
What the fuck?

114
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,728
- Where did you get these?
- Ya-ema requested these items

115
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,097
to envision
the purity of people

116
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,933
whose auras
we must investigate,

117
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,036
before mistress Becky allows
them near the child.

118
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,572
- Is this for real?
- It's just important that she feels safe

119
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,808
when Tama is
with us, that's all.

120
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,577
- So, you put a curse on me?
- No, no, no. We haven't cursed you yet.

121
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,245
We probably won't
unless Ya-ema sees

122
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,613
something in the smoke
that he doesn't like.

123
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:29,449
This is sick. You are sick!

124
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,419
That's not helping.
Can you just give us a minute?

125
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:33,621

126
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,257

00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,739
Hello! Exactly.

173
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,714
You know you'll hate yourself forever
if you miss these years with her.

174
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,150
- Ooh.
- Heavy shit, Dirtbag Danny.

175
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,252
- Nobody calls me that anymore.
- This is the night show

176
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,687
- with DJ Dirtbag Danny,
- Ah.

177
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:53,125
Playing all the dirty,
nasty rock you can only hear after dark.

178
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,029
Becky?

179
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,429
- Becky?
- Becky?

180
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,398
- Becky?
- Becky?

181
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,567
- Becky?
- Becky?

182
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,406
Becky! Becky! Becky!

183
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,053
Hmm.

184
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:24,222
Hey.

185
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:26,425
You seen Tiffany?

186
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,632
You shouldn't come around here
and see her like this.

187
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,134
What choice do I have?

188
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:40,303
I'm the loser
who always crawls back.

189
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,972
Twice, she fired me
from this tour

190
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,777
and forgot about it the next morning.
We all crawl back.

191
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:52,517
How much
is she paying the shaman?

192
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,152
I'm not sure.
But in all likelihood,

193
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:57,957
that answer would upset
you and me both.

194
00:12:58,523 --> 00:12:59,990
How's business?

195
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,358
Euro tour's canceled but I
guess you already knew that.

196
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,628
- Yeah.
- They're opening the vaults for an AP or something.

197
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,966
Oh, if she's gonna fuck this
up for all of us it doesn't end well.

198
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,199
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,704
Yeah. And don't be
so negative.

200
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:15,941
What's about?
You need cash?

201
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,510
Tama needs more
than I can give.

202
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,813
Becky has
to take responsibility, right?

203
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:24,516
- May I?
- Sure.

204
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:31,187
Howard might cancel the dates
we're holding for the new record.

205
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:34,157
- He knows we're not ready.
- What does that mean?

206
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,192
It means that I hope you have a plan
B to put this one in private school.

207
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:38,995
Is she in breach?
Should I talk to someone?

208
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,532
No. Our lawyer's got it
sorted out.

209
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,736
No one's really expecting much
for her at this point though.

210
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,136
She handed me
my walking papers,

211
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:49,672
seven months later
she hands me Tama.

212
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,576
Ever since then
my life's been a nightmare,

213
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:53,210
in some ways.

214
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,512
Wow. That's heavy-duty.

215
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,983
It's my fault. I thought you two
would be a match made in heaven.

216
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,720
I want her out now.
I want her out.

217
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:06,455
- Fuck off! She has to go...
- You can't be serious.

218
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:09,491
Now! We saw it in the smoke.
The child will be my downfall. Ya-ema...

219
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,994
- I did not decree this.
- You did, you did, you did.

220
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,428
You saw a prophecy when we
were in the other place.

221
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,430
You said the child would
be my downfall.

222
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:17,666
We have a lit stick of dynamite
that needs tossing out the tank!

223
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,434
Becky, this is your child
we're talking about.

224
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:24,706
Mistress Becky!
Mistress Becky!

225
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,077
Look at my king.

226
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:29,047
What do you see?

227
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,249
Tell us.

228
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,650
I see the void of eternity.

229
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:46,129
- Hey. Hey!
- Howard! Howard.

230
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:47,929
- They loved you.
- How are you?

231
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,465
- And I love that they loved you.
- It was a good show, huh?

232
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,601
Great.

233
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:55,070
- Danny, what's happening?
- Holding it together.

234
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:57,038
- You wouldn't understand.
- Oh.

235
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,141
Uh, Becky, Zelda is waiting.

236
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:01,376
Ah, fuck. I forgot.
What does that bitch want?

237
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:03,277
- Easy, love.
- Express regards

238
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,946
to your celebratory remarks.

239
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,648
- Whatever.
- She said you were great tonight.

240
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,452
What, did she just come here with fucking
obvious stuff that I already know or what?

241
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,319
Of course, I was great.
I am always good.

242
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,890
I believe I saw her
with an olive branch.

243
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:16,725
Would I lead you astray?

244
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,760
- No, Howard...
- Do it for me. Come on.

245
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,562
She's not lying.
You were great tonight.

246
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:22,164
She brings negativity.

247
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,298
You see? You see?

248
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,534
What is Zelda Ezekiel coming
and doing here anyways,

249
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:29,436
coming backstage at our show when I'm trying
to spend quality time with my family,

250
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,775
- and just demand an audience?
- Chill out, Beck.

251
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,609
Zelda's all right.

252
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,681
Yeah.

253
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,583
Okay. Where is she, Howard?

254
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:44,318
- Um...
- While we're on the topic,

255
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,122
can you please tell me, are we doing those
recordings of our tracks like last time?

256
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,690
Ali says you're doing an EP
instead of a whole record.

257
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:52,693
Yeah, she, like, found some pretty
powerful stuff in the '92 sessions.

258
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:54,328
Of course. Anything you need.

259
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,499
- Can't get a fucking straight answer out of them, you know?
- Anything you need.

260
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,635
That's because
you understand me, don't you?

261
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:04,338
You really know I can't count
on anybody crazy.

262
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,842
What kind of world is this when we
can't even get straight information...

263
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,212
- Let's just say hello to Zelda.
- ...I'm recording an album.

264
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,112
- Okay?
- Why do you insult me?

265
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:14,048
- Well, I will sort it all out
- ...Or an E-fucking-P...

266
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,450
- while you're meeting with her, okay?
- ...guitar or something?

267
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:18,652
Just, dear, please, Howard.
Please just get me an answer

268
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:20,187
and please make it
an honest one.

269
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,690
She is very excited
to see everybody.

270
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,725
- Everybody.
- Everybody.

271
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,594
- Everybody? Wait, we're all going?
- Yes.

272
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:27,695
Ooh!

273
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:29,530
Why didn't you say so?

274
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:34,668
I don't wanna do it alone.
Come to me, my ex...

275
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,839
On the right, and to the left.
On the right, and to the left.

276
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,208
To the right, and to the left.
To the right, and to the left.

277
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,479
Oh, man, I wish
I had your patience.

278
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm a communicator.
I communicate.

279
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,653
Anything I can do?

280
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,823
Help her.

281
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:55,555
That'll help me.

282
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,558
I'm trying.

283
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,059
Always trying.

284
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,628
<i>♪ Hand bone, hand bone's connected to the</i>

285
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,797

287

288
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:19,113
- Great show.
- Oh, that's easy for you to say

289
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:20,847
from the comfort
of that chair, isn't it?

290
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,423
This is my love, L-L-Lauren.

291
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,425
Oh, what a beauty.

292
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,261
Come on. Marie's told me
all about you.

293
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,466
Ah! I can just go
if y'all want some alone time.

294
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,633
Calm down, girl.

295
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:43,937
What do we owe the
pleasure of your visitation?

296
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,240
'Cause you're killers.
I want to see the new shit for myself.

297
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,376
Well, what do you think?

298
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:51,813
I'm green with envy.

299
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:57,617
So, Howard said that you guys
are almost up in this one.

300
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,986
Yeah, I don't know if I'm really feeling
the stage life, know what I mean?

301
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:01,387
Why, what did he ask?

302
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:04,390
I've got a string
of dates coming up.

303
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:08,428
I was wondering if maybe you guys would
be, uh, interested in joining me.

304
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,629
Oh, I don't know.

305
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,931
What do you mean?
Like, opening act for you?

306
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,299
That doesn't really make
any sense, don't you think?

307
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,001
What is it, like,
six years ago?

308
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:16,601
Oh, wait, if it was
six years ago,

309
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:19,005
you'd be opening for M-E, me.

310
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,840
And you would be trying
to run off with this one.

311
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:23,777
Hey, when are the...
when are the dates?

312
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,181
What are the dates?

313
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,623
How about
a simple "No, thanks"?

314
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,524
And thank you,
by the way, for coming

315
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,996
to personally bitch slap us
in all of our faces.

316
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:45,264
We do rock music
for rock people.

317
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:46,965
And didn't I hear
that on your last record,

318
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,835
you didn't even have
any guitars?

319
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,603
I will never

320
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:54,442
- share a stage with you.
- Fucking be careful with that shit!

321
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,277
It's fine.

322
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,313
March-ish.

323
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,182
Hey, don't fucking
talk to her.

324
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,349
Don't even look at her.

325
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,886
Here's an idea. How about you
march-ish right out of this room

326
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,490
into your limousine and take
that fucking offer with you?

327
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,625
We need a break, not a tour.

328
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,526
We just finished this one
like, what, an hour ago.

329
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,229
Who's interested
in another tour?

330
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,039
You brought me
on my first tour, Beck.

331
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,041
I'll never forget it.

332
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,045
Look, I'm not your enemy.

333
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,178
I never was.

334
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,546
Despite what you think
happened at the festival thing.

335
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,850
You're gonna make me beg to
get you to bury the hatchet.

336
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:39,685
Listen to me.

337
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,223
Your music

338
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,725
used to be awesome.

339
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,061
And now it sucks.

340
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,761
So, I don't
wanna tour with you.

341
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,565
And now you come to bury me?

342
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,536
I mean, I think I can speak
for all of us when I say

343
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,770
that we have zero interest
in retreading the past,

344
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,375
which includes
your fabled support.

345
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,741
As I am trying

346
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:06,177
to move forward here,
not backwards,

347
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,681
which means I don't wanna
slip down your fucking bill.

348
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,082
I mean, don't you have, like,

349
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,052
the next generation of pansy,
art rock babes

350
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,188
who are just dying
to share your light?

351
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,689
Why don't you ask one of them?

352
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,691
Because my answer is no.

353
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:24,095
And where I go, they go.

354
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,297
- I should go.
- Babe, don't go.

355
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,599
Stay, please. I feel
like we're not...

356
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,601
You're one of a kind,
I'll give you that.

357
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:34,040
That's right, it's an original,
stick to your guns and your roots...

358
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,743
<i>♪ P-U-R-E spells Becky ♪</i>

359
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,982
- You are fucking lovely.
- So, do we have a deal?

360
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,615
Howard, how could you?

361
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:48,452
- You set me up. I trusted you.
- Now, I thought you might feel this way

362
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:50,087
but just hear us out. Okay?

363
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,324
It's not what you're thinking.
It's not gonna be clubs. It's theaters.

364
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:54,892
- Theaters.
- It's an intimate tour.

365
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,962
It's fuckin' boring.
It's really boring. Pass.

366
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,997
- Well, I'm sorry you feel bad.
- God, if you're not gonna leave,

367
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,665
I will. I have an interrupted
journey to complete.

368
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:06,103
And, by the way, you are all
being incredibly rude to Ya-ema

369
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:07,939
in the spiritual calm
that he requires.

370
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,110
I am not done with you.
You are in big trouble.

371
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,747
- Becky?
- Having fun in Becky-town?

372
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,084
Whatever could you mean?

373
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:20,986
Say it.

374
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,987
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Just say it.

375
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,090
It's nothing.

376
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,193
Hey.

377
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,336
Who is Ya-ema?

378
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,707
Uh, Sauron,
the all-seeing guru.

379
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,210
I'll go.

380
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,879
Yeah, I think
that might be for the best.

381
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,347
I'm so sorry.

382
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,550
It was worth a shot though.

383
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,019
Maybe we should...
take another swing

384
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:58,557
when she's not so... so...

385
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:00,691
I can't find the word.

386
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:05,028
Door's open. I'm all ears.

387
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,365
You know, you used to pack
places twice this size.

388
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,765
What happened?

389
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:13,704
Canceling tours, twice, at the last
minute has, oh, untested side-effects.

390
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,407
It'll be fine.

391
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:20,410
If you change your mind...

392
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:23,213
Cold smothered crap,
you're still here?

393
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:25,847
Jesus Christ, take a hint.

394
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,519
Zelda has left the building!

395
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:32,087
The Legend of Zelda
is stink to the air,

396
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,857
has come to an E-N-D,
if you please.

397
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,694
I'm leaving. Don't overreact.

398
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:40,697
I hardly think I'm overreacting.
I'm just normal reacting.

399
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,864
I'm sorry to be so fucking...

400
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:46,034
Hey, this was entirely my idea.
Don't blame her.

401
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:48,837
- Just let me take her. Let me take her.
- No, stop it.

402
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,506
No, you shouldn't
be holding her in this state.

403
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:51,773
What, is that
the state of rage,

404
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,409
or the state of New York?
'Cause I don't know where I am.

405
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:55,944
- Let me take her.
- ...fucking clown...

406
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:59,414
Wee! Oh!

407
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,951
That was a fun ride.
Wanna go on another sky ride?

408
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,887
- Huh? With Mommy?
- Fucking mess!

409
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:08,790
Perhaps we should all retreat
to our separate rooms for a bit?

410
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,593
Aren't you enjoying the show?
Huh, you got nothing to see now?

411
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,195
- Come on, it's fine.
- It's all right.

412
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:16,098
- Her job at the mall...
- No. Not right now, not with us.

413
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,867
- Am I running my mouth? Am I saying things I might regret?
- No, stop. Don't. Enough!

414
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,470
Why don't you... if you run you
can catch up with Zelda, huh?

415
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:24,906
She's boring and easy and fun.
And isn't that what you want?

416
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:26,475
- Beck, don't.
- Yeah.

417
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,143
Don't what?

418
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,912
Chill. BECKY: And what,
show everyone a G-O-O-D time?

419
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:32,780
Huh? Come here, baby.

420
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:35,284
Tough job, but somebody's gotta do
it, you know?

421
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:37,119
I gotta get out of here.
I've got to go to Becky's room.

422
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:39,554
This stinks of Zelda's shit.

423
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:43,227
Bitch, you would do... Hibbidah hibbidah
hibbidah. That's all fuckin' bullshit.

424
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,961
Wee!

425
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,565
- You all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

426
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,167
I'm fine.

427
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:03,077
Becky, you're okay, sweetie.

428
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:07,315
Beck, come on. Come on, Beck.

429
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:10,654
Come on, Beck.

430
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:14,623
Daddy, daddy!

431
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,092
- Her head.
- What's wrong?

432
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:19,460
Good girl.

433
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,331
Good girl, come on.

434
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,969
Not right now.

435
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:31,775
We go way beyond.

436
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:36,946
We go way beyond.

437
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,453
I can't believe
you're doing this to my child.

438
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:48,122
What are we supposed to do
with it, though? I don't really know.

439
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:49,392
Well, just hang it. What do you
mean, "What are we supposed..."

440
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,225
Here you go.

441
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:53,461
Yeah!

442
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:55,129
I mean, we are the first

443
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,798
and only girl band to ever
sell this many records.

444
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,034
I'd like to say...

445
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,336
Oh, shit!

446
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,548
We're never gonna
make a record this good again.

447
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,682
Ki-bash!

448
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:15,984
Oh!

449
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:19,422
Howard!

450
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,988
We need a new one.

451
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,859
We have another one.

452
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:27,595
- I'm not touching that.
- Wait, wait, wait...

453
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:28,765
We're sorry, sorry.

454
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:31,066
Wait, get the record!

455
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,503
Okay. I got it. I got it.

456
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,874
Run, run, run, run.

457
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:04,633
<i>♪ You rotted away</i>

458
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:09,937
<i>♪ Tied to your own mistakes</i>

459
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:16,944
<i>♪ I never wanted to be
that crutch for you</i>

460
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:24,419
<i>♪ All in denial</i>

461
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:29,624
<i>♪ With every word you breathe</i>

462
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:36,431
<i>♪ I'm not to try
and piece it back for you ♪</i>

463
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,768
I finally understand why you
begged me to stop checking in.

464
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,203
That's a fucking bummer,
right?

465
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,939
I told you you shouldn't
come back.

466
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:48,340
I had to see for myself
who was occupying the studio

467
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:50,008
that I had stopped paying for.

468
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,110
Or did they not
give you the memo?

469
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,513
Well, Becky
decided to pay for it

470
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:57,686
and must have old you about it,
out of respect. I guess.

471
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,688
Isn't that nice of her.

472
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:03,756
I have this room booked
for my new group,

473
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,959
but it's not yet vacated.

474
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,359
That's why you came back.

475
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,995
Did they not tell you
you needed to leave?

476
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:11,296
Yeah. They did.

477
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,500
And what did she say?

478
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,602
I... I'd rather not repeat it.

479
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,947
Well, if this is the best she's
got to show after nine months,

480
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:31,483
I'm, I'm... I'm very screwed.

481
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,720
We know you're out on a limb
for her on this, big time.

482
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:38,022
Laid off workers
to cover overages,

483
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:40,225
mortgage on my beach house.
I'm not out on a limb.

484
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm lying on the ground
next to the damn tree.

485
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,897
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

486
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:49,568
Releasing their new album this year
would help cover your mess, if I could...

487
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,671
What is this,
Talk and Tea time?

488
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:53,739
Are we doing a session

489
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:55,474
or is this
a goddamn book club?

490
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:57,174
Jesus Christ!
Am I the only one...

491
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,914
This is the first day in two weeks
she's been here for longer than an hour.

492
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,516
Also, she came in at 2:00.

493
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,917
- Well...
- AM.

494
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,251
We've been here. She's
in the self-proclaimed groove.

495
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,688
Show of hands.
Who is committed to greatness

496
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,557
and will do whatever
it takes to achieve it?

497
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,060
And a show of hands, who is lazy
and doesn't care about the music

498
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,765
that we are recording here?

499
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,938
That's one for greatness.
Anyone else?

500
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,106
Thank you, Keith. It's nice
to know someone is on my side,

501
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,709
the winning side.
And we all know who writes history.

502
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,711
You all can just go home
and take a nap or something

503
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,882
'cause your level of
dedication has been exposed.

504
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,416
Right, Howard?

505
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:41,619
Did you come to check up
on your prized project?

506
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,554
Thank you for giving us
some space lately,

507
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,855
but I gotta tell you,

508
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,426
I'm sorry, but it is
going terribly.

509
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:52,129
- At best.
- Well, there is a solution to this.

510
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,398
I just need to figure out
what it is.

511
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,734
If we could all just take
a step back, and think

512
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,070
- for a second.
- That is a grand idea.

513
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,205
Why can't you two be
more like team players,

514
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,040
- like Howard?
- Just give it a rest, lady.

515
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,208
The show's exhausting.

516
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,579
And I've seen it too many
times to stick for the finale.

517
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,413
Sorry, what? What did you say?

518
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,715
- She said that...
- No, I heard her.

519
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,785
I just wanted to make sure
I heard her correctly.

520
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:20,758
Ali darling, care to take it one more time
from the top with feeling, <i>s'il vous plait?</i>

521
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,293
Look at yourself.

522
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,497
Easy, now.

523
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,166
Would Becky Something wither and die
if she interacted on an adult level?

524
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,435
Okay.
Let's just be calm, all right?

525
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,305
We can withdraw
to some neutral place,

526
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,808
- and discuss a compromise, so that we can...
- Boring, Howard.

527
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,645
- No, I'm fucking tired.
- We can work this out.

528
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,277
Ali?

529
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
Maybe she could make some
sort of grand final statement.

530
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,951
What? Why? Why would
I explain myself to you,

531
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,688
when you're only gonna
remember your version?

532
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,658
I'm fucking done!

533
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,466
She's still talking.

534
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,703
She's leaving.

535
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,106
That is hers though.

536
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,609
And, oh,
I took care of this band

537
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,346
while you took care
of yourself.

538
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,113
I didn't want to be thanked.

539
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,818
I didn't want the gloss.
That was your thing.

540
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,820
You just plucked me into it.

541
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,689
So, enjoy it. Have fun.

542
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,693
Ali, come on. Don't...

543
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,499
Well, that is just
as Ya-ema prophesied,

544
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,735
and what a fitting moment.

545
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:42,040
Just when I was seriously
doubting your commitment.

546
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:49,244
It's been a rotten year
bringing this mongoloid to term.

547
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,948
But I knew it. I knew it.
I knew today was gonna be the final straw.

548
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,718
I knew it when I walked
in the D-O-O-R.

549
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,522
There was a fetid stink
in the elevator, you know?

550
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,992
Big whoop, right?

551
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,228
Watch this, watch this.
Watch how quickly we're gonna bounce back.

552
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,564
All right? You watch this.

553
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,033
- You watching?
- I'm watching.

554
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,103
Watch.

555
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,405
Are you watching?

556
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,174
I'm watching.

557
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:19,241
I'm looking.

558
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,943
Look, I'm Ali!

559
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,780
Watch! I'm Ali now!

560
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:40,262
- Excuse me.
- Wait, Mari. You can't just...

561
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:42,266
Mari. Mari, don't just...

562
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,715
Fucked up!

563
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:00,251
You fuckin...

564
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,240
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

565
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,322
Hee-hee-hee...

566
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:54,637
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

567
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:26,094
Marielle, help.
Fuck, what a fuckin' honor.

568
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,361
No, Mari's fine.

569
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:31,364
Um, we're booked. I mean,
we were booked.

570
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:34,466
- I don't... Howard said...
- Yeah, yeah, I heard. I mean, it's just a...

571
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,069
It's just
a whole nightmare right now.

572
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:38,772
Are you kidding? We only want this
place 'cause you guys record here.

573
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,707
Yeah. Shameful to say,
it's like an honor

574
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,076
to be bumped by Something
She, like, the top.

575
00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:45,544
- Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
- No, no, that's all right.

576
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:47,916
I mean, it's just a terrible
time to join a woman in.

577
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,386
She's all gone,
like the worst she's ever gone.

578
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,391
- Keith, where's Howard?
- He's in the back office.

579
00:34:58,393 --> 00:34:59,692
You might wanna check on him.

580
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:01,562
He doesn't look good,
and I think he's dry-heaving.

581
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:04,799
See, exactly.

582
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:08,634
I mean,
not to get too deep, but...

583
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:10,003
She's, like,
falling apart big time now,

584
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:12,571
so, maybe actually...

585
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:14,508
We move out and you
girlies just take over.

586
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:22,750
<i>♪ Because you're young</i>

587
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:27,456
<i>♪ Sharp as a knife</i>

588
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:32,827
<i>♪ You need that buzz</i>

589
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:37,598

<i>♪ To settle down ♪</i>

594
00:35:57,685 --> 00:35:59,987
Fuckin'. She's the queen.

595
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,888
No, I won't let her
hear you say that.

596
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,624
Actually, does she even know
you're even here?

597
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,861
Unclear.

598
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,162
So, I don't know
if she's gonna be into that.

599
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:12,900
I mean, the behavior in here's
been, shall I say, erratic lately.

600
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,134
Erratic on a good day.

601
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,537
- On a bad day?
- They're all bad days nowadays.

602
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,413
Well, it seems like
we have a logjam.

603
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:28,080
We're all family here.

604
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:31,450
Business family. One
big, happy business family.

605
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:34,919
- Um, yeah, you know, if there's like a problem...
- Nonsense. No problem at all.

606
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,289
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

607
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,856
We'll record your album.

608
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,161
We'll release it.
Everything will work out easy as pie.

609
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:44,030
Becky... Becky'll understand.

610
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:48,235
Uh, I also think she knows
we're here now.

611
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:50,870
Oh, yeah.

612
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,225
Here she comes.

613
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,216
Who the fuck are
these bitches?

614
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:38,084
The Aker girls.

615
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:43,955
Did I not send you their
seven inch... You're gonna love them.

616
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,057
You're gonna
love them. They're...

617
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:48,326
Yeah,
I've signed them. And...

618
00:37:48,328 --> 00:37:52,729
We're not interrupting, so, like,
no disrespect Ms. Something.

619
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:53,797
We're huge fans.

620
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:55,765
And as thrilling
as it is to see your...

621
00:37:55,767 --> 00:38:00,605
Your passion and commitment, I was
counting on the studio being free by now.

622
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:03,441
I... perhaps,
it's my mistake.

623
00:38:03,443 --> 00:38:05,978
- Because I haven't exactly been around.
- You cut us off.

624
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,846
They tried to evict me.

625
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:13,484
- Why would you do that to us, Howard?
- It's a misunderstanding.

626
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,685
I was giving you
space and freedom

627
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,357
without my breathing
down your neck.

628
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:19,856
You know?

629
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:22,959
And I did what I had to do
to tighten my belt

630
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:24,497
but can you blame me?

631
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:30,635
- Did you know about this?
- Nope.

632
00:38:30,637 --> 00:38:32,971
We just showed.
She had no idea.

633
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,125
Howard, you fucking genius.

634
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,664
What are the odds?

635
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:05,468
What are the odds that we would find
ourselves one apple short of a bushel,

636
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,471
and you would unknowingly
bring me a solution

637
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,243
to all of
the world's problems?

638
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:14,712
Who plays the drums?

639
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:25,721
Are the rest
of you ready to jam?

640
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:30,393
Because if I had to guess, I would say
that we are 15, maybe 20 minutes away

641
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:33,829
from pure magic exploding
into this room.

642
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,065
And silly me, I lost a drummer

643
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,169
on the way
to grandmother's house.

644
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,406
Here I thought we'd have to
scrap paper and go home.

645
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,007
And what should
happen instead,

646
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:48,244
three witches come
to my rescue.

647
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:50,946
Look at all of you.
Just look at you.

648
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:55,719
My god, you're so beautiful.
You're stunning.

649
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:59,056
I'm Crassie Cassie,
this is Dottie OZ, and Roxy Rotten.

650
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:02,593
She's the life of the party
and we'd be honored.

651
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,061
Cut the shit.

652
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:08,931
Come on, you're making me feel
like I'm a hundred years old.

653
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,200
But goddamn, I just
really feel a connection

654
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,068
to you babes, you know?
You feel that, Mari?

655
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,637
Yeah, Beck, I feel it.

656
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,904
I've been out here feeling it.

657
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:18,073
It feels like I were waiting
for you to fucking feel it.

658
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:19,477
And that's
what I'm talking about.

659
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,312
Howard, my goodman.

660
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:23,911
I'm ready to party.

661
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:26,715
Let's make an album because
I have been sent some angels

662
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,251
to work the angles, you dig?

663
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:32,820
And what better way
to introduce new...

664
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,890
...blood into
this turgid process,

665
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,730
than actual new blood?

666
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:43,399
Let's bathery these bitches.

667
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:46,903
Learn a thing or two about what
the kids are feeling nowadays, huh?

668
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:49,407
Inward, ho.

669
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:53,943
Keith,
can you give us a minute?

670
00:40:57,548 --> 00:40:58,781
What the hell are you doing?

671
00:40:58,783 --> 00:41:00,848
Well, it looks like
I'm saving your asshole

672
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,918
and keeping
this record on schedule.

673
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,522
Don't you worry about reimbursing
me for the studio, it's my treat.

674
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:08,890
I can't afford
another eight months,

675
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:11,292
I will go bankrupt
while you finish your opus.

676
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,995
I'm on my last credit line,
and you're on life no. 9,

677
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:17,131
and these girls might
be our salvation.

678
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:20,134
So, it would be swell if you didn't
torpedo them in the process of drowning.

679
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:23,638
Howard, you confuse torpedoing,
which I don't know anything about,

680
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,007
with making an album, which
you'll, if you'll excise me,

681
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:30,111
I'm quite eager to resume
before my juices dry up again.

682
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,446
Can you
make her aware?

683
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,381
Ugh. What,
do I need a translator?

684
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:35,849
I got it, loud and clear.

685
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,352
It's ear
on the rear of a deer.

686
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,886
Look, we don't need to do this.
We just fucking met 'em.

687
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:41,222
We can take...

688
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:43,193
...a day to regroup
and we can just call Ali.

689
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,829
Who? Who?

690
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:50,298
I don't know anybody
by that name.

691
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,701
It's actually kind
of a funny name.

692
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:53,568
If you think about it.

693
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,637
Except if you're a Muslim.

694
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,976
Mari.

695
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,480
My love.

696
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,750
You have my attention.

697
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,653
And I, yours.

698
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:17,592
Is there something
that you wanted to say,

699
00:42:17,594 --> 00:42:20,095
or was that just
a challenge to a duel?

700
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,232
We don't get another chance...

701
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:26,701
...if we fuck this up.

702
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,902
Sorry, if you fuck this up!

703
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:30,406
If you'll
fucking fuck this up,

704
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,543
it's bye-bye, Something She.

705
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:37,911
You dig?

706
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:39,081
That's
the short of it.

707
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:49,893
I'm gonna finish the record.

708
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:52,294
You have my word.

709
00:42:54,096 --> 00:42:55,597
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

710
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:20,154
♪ ...Three, four,
skip to my Lou...

711
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:29,596
It's over.

712
00:43:29,598 --> 00:43:31,397
That's that.

713
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:34,636
I trusted you to be alone
and you burned down the house.

714
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:36,505
Oh, god.

715
00:43:37,706 --> 00:43:39,974
Yeah, I'll... I'll sort it.

716
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:43,375
Look, the lioness is...

717
00:43:43,377 --> 00:43:44,778
You know,
seen threatening cubs.

718
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,278
She's forcing them
into the pride

719
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,015
rather than killing 'em
and eating 'em.

720
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:50,983
Can you handle her?

721
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,419
I mean, it's been nearly seven years.
What's another seven days?

722
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,323
Yeah. If we wanna
run without Ali, I...

723
00:43:57,024 --> 00:43:58,357
I can't help you.

724
00:43:58,359 --> 00:43:59,826
But I need you.

725
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:01,128
Yeah, I got this, man.

726
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:04,999
Do you need
your rocket fuel?

727
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,436
Yeah, I need
all the help I can get.

728
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:37,398
Hi.

729
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:39,534
Hi.

730
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,374
Are you okay to do this?

731
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:51,812
Any second now.

732
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,214
I'll be fine.

733
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:02,924
Can you give me a minute?

734
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:06,359
Yeah.

735
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:40,425
All right, who's ready
to do this shit?

736
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:44,796
- Anything you say.
- Easy, easy. Easy there. It's simple as that.

737
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:46,531
I'm comfortable
in a leadership role

738
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:48,366
but let's slide
into this hot spring.

739
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:50,468
Do you want us to look at any
sheets or just follow along?

740
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,038
Oh, you chicks read music?
Fuck, what a loser I am.

741
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,907
Well, there's some pieces
we've been playing with,

742
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:58,308
but doesn't it make more sense
not to rely on old scraps,

743
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,210
and start a feast
with a new family instead?

744
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:01,713
The album's written
if that's what you mean.

745
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,449
Let's hit it. Whatever you need.
Just, uh, say the word.

746
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,383
Yeah,
there is an album.

747
00:46:06,385 --> 00:46:10,420
There's some music, but, you
know, maybe that's the problem.

748
00:46:10,422 --> 00:46:12,322
It's cursed.
It's done to death.

749
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:14,959
There's a new sound.
Let's see what the kids are doing.

750
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:18,130
- What, just play?
- Could I have made myself any clearer? Yes, play!

751
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:22,601
I mean, if we're gonna be working
together, let's see what you've got.

Who wrote it?

779
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:25,123
- Music...
- All of you?

780
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,357
Brilliant.

781
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:30,960
I've always longed
for that kind of connection.

782
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:33,531
You know? But for some reason,
it just never worked.

783
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:35,531
I just always did it.

Oh, sure, Mari. Your contributions
have been, you know, helpful.

786
00:48:42,907 --> 00:48:45,608
But I'm talking about, like,
a ground-up collaboration.

787
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,475
- Yeah.
- I wish I could give it to you now

788
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:49,245
but, I just, I know
myself too well,

789
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:51,279
and it's you know,
highway or her way.

790
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:53,215
We're gonna jam,
you know, back you up.

791
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:55,084
- Anything.
- It's what I need, followers.

792
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:57,485
Silent peons
to worship at my feet.

793

Ladies, ladies,
what harmony you have found

794
00:48:59,924 --> 00:49:02,357
within one another.
What spirit shared

795
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,129
and just divided three ways.

796
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,396
God, it is
the rarest of things

797
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:10,900
that should not
be taken lightly.

798
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:13,068
Capture it, my sisters,
hold on to it,

799
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,571
and then never, never release
that bond you share.

800
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,109
Wise advice
from a true original.

801
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:21,112
Are you fucking kidding me?

802
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:24,679
You know, I hope you girlies
don't buy this bullshit.

803
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:26,349
I mean, you seem smart.
Smarter than me.

804
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:29,285
Dumb old merry
grade-A sucker.

805
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:32,156
Bought it, hook, line, and sinker.
Fool me once, shame, shame, shame.

806
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:34,125
Sorry, what?

807
00:49:35,692 --> 00:49:40,461
I mean, who better
than the great Becky Something

808
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:42,497
to dispel wisdom
on the value of others,

809
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:44,532
who does more
to express appreciation

810
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:46,634
and dedication to those
you fucking support.

811
00:49:46,636 --> 00:49:48,338
I support.

812
00:49:49,472 --> 00:49:51,873
This is not a two-a-day
two-way street, darling.

813
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,342
No, it's a dead end, darling.

814
00:49:54,144 --> 00:49:56,644
It is a dead end.

815
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:58,146
Mari, Mari, better be careful,

816
00:49:58,148 --> 00:50:00,148
or you're gonna offend
our guests.

817
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,183
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

818
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:04,484
We can just leave,
you know?

819
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:07,121
We don't wanna be flies on the
wall while you sort this stuff out.

820
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,890
See? Now look
what you've fucking done.

821
00:50:08,892 --> 00:50:10,524
Alienating the acolytes.

822
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:11,860
Vanquish the venerating.

823
00:50:11,862 --> 00:50:14,028
Exile the exuberant.

824
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,563
This is a blessed thing.
It's the next.

825
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:19,633
Hold them close we should,
not exile them.

826
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:20,969
This is in poor taste.

827
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:23,238
Yeah. It always is.

828
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,241
And then it's not.

829
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,640
Run away. Flee!

830
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:30,477
Flee! Big Bad Bossy Becky
Makes Maudlin Mari Mope.

831
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:32,313
Get the bullshit out of here.

832
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:35,185
It belongs... it belongs
on fucking Mars.

833
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:41,555
Enjoy it because...
'Cause it could be fun. Enjoy it.

834
00:50:41,557 --> 00:50:43,692
Well, that's the first logical
thing I've heard all day.

835
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:05,348
All I ever ask is for a little
respect, you know?

836
00:51:08,784 --> 00:51:11,453
If you can't get that in the
workplace, then where can you get it?

837
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:14,757
You dig, right?

838
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:22,798
Mush. You will mush.

839
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:25,899
- Mush! Mush, mush.
- Okay.

840
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:30,603
Onward, into the future.
Beep-beep!

841
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:32,706
Okay. You know what,
I think we should just come back.

842
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,074
This doesn't seem
like the right time...

843
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:35,809
Night time is the right time.
Bed ways is the right way,

844
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:37,177
so tally-ho.

845
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,249
Not that we're not
organized product. We are, of course.

846
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,886
Let the wild rumpus begin.

847
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:51,191
<i>♪ Garbage dump
Oh, garbage dump</i>

848
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:55,561
<i>♪ Why are you called
the garbage dump</i>

849
00:51:55,563 --> 00:51:59,832
<i>♪ You could feed the world
with my garbage dump</i>

850
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:07,006
<i>♪ You could feed the world
with my garbage dump ♪</i>

851
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,176
Mari just left.
We don't need to be here right now.

852
00:52:09,178 --> 00:52:11,944
We can give you your space.
This must not be super easy.

853
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:14,013
Wrong.

854
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:17,583
I am the heart and soul
of this band.

855
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:20,420
Hello, I named it
after myself.

856
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:24,957
I found those girlies, and they were not
the first, and they will not be the last.

857
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,492
I put Something She together

858
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:29,128
from the ashes
of failed junk bands,

859
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,263
wanting to have
something in my own name,

860
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:34,635
like God spewing mankind.

861
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:39,438
That's ancient history,
and so are those ungrateful wenches

862
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,474
who suckled
at the teat of success

863
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,809
that I placed
upon their mouth.

864
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:46,045
Before we embark
upon this journey,

865
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,813
promise me one thing.
Show me honesty,

866
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:49,648
and I will do the same,

867
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:53,285
because that is the pillar
of my music.

868
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,154
So, enough
with this jibber-jabber

869
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:56,856
and let's rock!

870
00:52:56,858 --> 00:52:59,460
And that sums it up
in one big lump.

871
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:05,064
What should we do?

872
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:08,566
Well, for starters, go into that
booth, and wake those turds up,

873
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:11,037
and tell them it's blast off
to the fucking stars.

874
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,804
We gonna hit
the fucking switch

875
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:15,476
because the circus is leaving
town and it ain't coming back.

876
00:53:17,345 --> 00:53:19,844
We'll go get
the rest of our gear?

877
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:20,914
Oh, yeah!

878
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,608
You know,
you can't be fully acquainted

879
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,846
with Becky Something until
you want her to fuck off.

880
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:55,115
Remember that.

881
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:16,635
<i>♪ You'd rather die</i>

882
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:22,639
<i>♪ Than apologize</i>

883
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:28,081
<i>♪ But fuck it I didn't need
To see this through</i>

884
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:36,954
<i>♪ I'm back
Back to the same shit</i>

885
00:54:36,956 --> 00:54:41,328
<i>♪ I was drowning in then</i>

886
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:47,398
<i>♪ If I'm gonna be pulled down</i>

887
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,770
<i>♪ Then I'm taking you with</i>

888
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:57,741
<i>♪ I'm back
Back to the same shit</i>

889
00:54:57,743 --> 00:55:02,514
<i>♪ I was drowning in then</i>

890
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:07,485
<i>♪ If I'm gonna be pulled down</i>

891
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:11,357
<i>♪ Then I'm taking you with ♪</i>

892
00:55:29,141 --> 00:55:30,374
We need
to lose their minds.

893
00:55:30,376 --> 00:55:34,511
- Oh, my God...
- Girls, I am so proud of you.

894
00:55:34,513 --> 00:55:38,282
My mom would never ever,
ever come to something like this.

895
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:42,619
Oh, I never missed a show,
a concert, a school play.

896
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:43,987
Becky, tell them.

897
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,056
It's basically,
you're our mum, too, aren't you?

898
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:47,291
Yes!

899
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:50,194
- Oh, she's so nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

900
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:52,663
- She's so nervous.
- Mom, shut up. I'm not nervous.

901
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:55,998
- I'm just trying to practice.
- I'm really happy you're here.

902
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,469
- I'm...
- Thank you, Mom!

903
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,837
This is so much fun.

904
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,243
Oh, God, you're so amazing.
I'm so proud...

905
00:56:40,378 --> 00:56:41,844
Hey, you seen Becky?
She checked in yet?

906
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:42,847
Nah, man.

907
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:47,185
Hey.

908
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:50,953
How's my grandbaby?

909
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:53,389
She's at home with Tiffany.
She's miserable.

910
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:55,560
- Her mom's a deadbeat who never calls.
- Poor Daniel.

911
00:56:56,394 --> 00:56:58,229
Drawn into family saga.

912
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:02,600
I'm her new family.

913
00:57:04,235 --> 00:57:05,934
Life goes on.

914
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:06,937
Hopefully it does.

915
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:11,875
She's not here.

916
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,743
Everybody's looking.

917
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:16,112
What happened
to my baby Rebecca?

918
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:18,249
Did I do something that wrong?

919
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:23,653
Daniel, everything
we've been put through,

920
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:24,656
and for what?

921
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:28,056
- For love?
- Ah, yes.

922
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:29,594
For love.

923
00:57:31,462 --> 00:57:33,596
- She in here?
- No.

924
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:35,797
We're 40 minutes behind.
Venue's lights out at midnight.

925
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:38,969
Don't set your watch
to Becky-time.

926
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,804
What are we doing here?
She won't perform.

927
00:57:42,806 --> 00:57:44,007
Yeah, she has to.

928
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:46,141
She has to? Why?

929
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:49,079
Well, we got a bad feeling
this is it for Becky.

930
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,315
She's opening in a small venue
with proteges.

931
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:55,352
She's sold out arenas.

932
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,254
Why do you fall for it?

933
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:04,159
She cut the head off our life
together swiftly, and with no mercy,

934
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,296
and apparently I'll never
come to terms with that.

935
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,269
She's way behind
what we agreed on for Tama.

936
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:18,807
I've been trying
to get her and these

937
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:21,778
in the same room
for three months.

938
00:58:23,714 --> 00:58:26,381
Her lawyer quit. He called me.

939
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:30,520
Yeah, her plan is to ignore anybody
suing her until they give up or die.

940
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:35,991
Yep.
I should have knocked.

941
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:38,959
- Alexandra.
- You fell for it!

942
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:41,529
She'll be here.
She will be here.

943
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:43,298
Ooh, where do
you find the faith?

944
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,301
It's a curse. If you have anything to
have, it'll never be weighed.

945
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,336
I cannot believe
I got talked into this.

946
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:50,372
- She needs you.
- Yeah, no, every bully needs

947
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:53,543
a weak punching bag to swing
back for one more smack.

948
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,245
No one cares about
the players, right?

949
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:59,048
They're just here for Becky.

950
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:01,551
I mean,
what am I gonna do, quit?

951
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:04,186
Be a nobody?

952
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,555
I don't even belong
in this world.

953
00:59:07,557 --> 00:59:09,892
I used to play church basements
and I was happy there.

954
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:14,865
Never even played
venues this big.

955
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:17,734
Really big.

956
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:20,403
A block from the underground.

957
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:25,174
Footnote in the defining
oral history of the era.

958
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:27,443
Fuck.

959
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:31,912
We all rely on her
for something.

960
00:59:31,914 --> 00:59:33,449
We rely on Ms. Something
for something.

961
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,251
Fame.

962
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:37,086
Work. Glory.

963
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:39,288
Money. Love. Support.

964
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:42,289
Opportunity.

965
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,858
Our golden goose sprays
golden piss in our faces.

966
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,762
She supported me
for many years.

967
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:48,697
Yeah, me too.

968
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:50,633
What a wretched feeling.

969
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,301
As you know.

970
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,743
And such is the end
of the saga of Something She.

971
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,745
Ignominious.

972
01:00:03,412 --> 01:00:04,413
Fitting.

973
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,079
So, let's go.

974
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:09,284
I'm gonna
go talk to security.

975
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:13,252
She ain't here.

976
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:15,154
Fuck. Fuck, I fucking knew it.

977
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:17,223
- No, I think she's gonna show.
- Don't fucking touch me.

978
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:18,661
That's the spirit.

979
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:24,096
Dirtbag Danny,
it's really you!

980
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,298
It's just... just Danny.

981
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,133
Dude, I taped
your show religiously,

982
01:00:27,135 --> 01:00:28,669
- like, every night, bro. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

983
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:31,239
I don't even have the early tapes.
You got some special stuff there.

984
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:34,173
Yeah, this is really
fucking great, but this is

985
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:37,343
kind of, like, a big
fucking deal for us, so.

986
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:40,513
And don't mind me trivializing
your professional dilemma.

987
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:43,583
I just... I've been in your shoes
more times than I can count.

988
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:45,518
Can you give us
a success ratio? Anything?

989
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,120
I mean, like, this is not okay.
This isn't okay.

990
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,490
There's a plan, right? You make the plan,
you stick to it. It's written in ink.

991
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:52,160
Hey, she will be here.

992
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:54,193
Might be any second.

993
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:55,495
Might be in two hours.

994
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:57,797
But, no, it's...

995
01:00:57,799 --> 01:01:02,201
it's really cool and all what you're
doing for Becky and me, I guess.

996
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:04,002
But Beck's not used
to not headlining.

997
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:06,541
So she forgets that
nobody waits for the opener.

998
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:08,476
All right. So what do we do?

999
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:13,479
You got any
vocal warmups, or...

1000
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:15,450
I don't... I don't know
what your pre-show is.

1001
01:01:16,183 --> 01:01:17,285
You wanna jam?

1002
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:19,418
Or just, like make out?

1003
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,454
This is beyond me, okay?

1004
01:01:21,456 --> 01:01:23,188
Just find me when the nightmare's over.
I'm done.

1005
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,359
Oh, boy.
She needs this.

1006
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,895
She's going through
a lot. We all are.

1007
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,229
Shit's like wobbly with us,
you know? Heartbreak.

1008
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:32,901
Wiser folks have
tried and failed.

1009
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:37,402
But, pay, guys. I signed
the contracts for today.

1010
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:40,706
So, if she doesn't show,
you can sue her, too.

1011
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,642
And I think that'll make
a baker's dozen.

1012
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:46,244
Oh. Hi. Sorry. Um. Roxy.

1013
01:01:46,246 --> 01:01:48,981
- Hi.
- That was Dottie, and this is Crassie.

1014
01:01:48,983 --> 01:01:50,983
- Hi. Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

1015
01:01:50,985 --> 01:01:54,720
Thanks for giving her this chance.
I know she doesn't make it easy.

1016
01:01:54,722 --> 01:01:57,155
She'd do it for us.
Already did, actually. So.

1017
01:01:57,157 --> 01:01:58,826
Oh, yeah? How'd you repay her?

1018
01:01:59,593 --> 01:02:00,694
By fucking it up?

1019
01:02:02,162 --> 01:02:04,095
She'll be here.
It's a pattern.

1020
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:05,397
Thank you so much.

1021
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:07,934
Disappear, make you miserable,

1022
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:09,601
keep you waiting,

1023
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:11,037
then come back
when you're out of options.

1024
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,072
My mom wouldn't step foot
in a place like this, so.

1025
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:17,876
Well, I'm not just here to watch
Becky inflict pain on others.

1026
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:19,947
We have enough of that
to last lifetimes.

1027
01:02:22,015 --> 01:02:23,415
- Nothing?
- Nada.

1028
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:26,251
This is great!

1029
01:02:26,253 --> 01:02:28,587
Well, that's it.
I'm done. It's over.

1030
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:32,691
She has cost me a house,
half my company.

1031
01:02:32,693 --> 01:02:35,961
Can anyone here accuse me
of not trying hard enough?

1032
01:02:35,963 --> 01:02:38,830
Have I not provided
opportunity after opportunity,

1033
01:02:38,832 --> 01:02:40,199
and this is how it ends?

1034
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:43,370
Ah, forgive me. Ania.

1035
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:46,972
- You know it, and I know it.
- Lovely to see you.

1036
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:48,974
Thanks.

1037
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:51,445
At this point, does it even
matter if we wait any longer?

1038
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:55,279
We were supposed
to go on five minutes ago.

1039
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:57,983
We're going on hour two
of a sold-out crowd waiting

1040
01:02:57,985 --> 01:02:59,618
- for something to happen.
- I am deeply sorry.

1041
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,086
How could I know?

1042
01:03:01,088 --> 01:03:05,556
Start the show!

1043
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:07,124
All right, we'll give her
ten more minutes.

1044
01:03:07,126 --> 01:03:09,627
No, make that five.
Then, it's over.

1045
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:11,629
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

1046
01:03:11,631 --> 01:03:14,565
You know no one wants this night
to come off more than I do, but...

1047
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,300
Hey, you want to flip for it?

1048
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:17,635
I don't suppose
there's any benefit

1049
01:03:17,637 --> 01:03:20,738
in an Ali van der Wolff
acoustic solo set.

1050
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,807
At this point, anyone on stage but
Becky is only gonna make matters worse.

1051
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:25,578
Oh, I figured as much.

1052
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,578
So, what now?

1053
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:29,749
Wait.

1054
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,596
She's here.

1055
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:58,174
I always tried to do what was
best for my baby girl.

1056
01:03:58,176 --> 01:04:00,344
Music lessons,
drives to concerts.

1057
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:03,514
Start the fucking show!

1058
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:05,214
Start the fucking show!

1059
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,718
Get on the fucking stage!

1060
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,822
Becky?

1061
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:11,889
Becky!

1062
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:15,025
Ding dong,
and the bitch is back!

1063
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,460
Show of hands,
who missed me?

1064
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:21,634
- Two hours.
- Two minutes till midnight!

1065
01:04:26,072 --> 01:04:29,405
Hey, you're actually suing me, right?
Or is that somebody else?

1066
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,009
- I'm suing you.
- I'll see you in court.

1067
01:04:32,011 --> 01:04:35,014
Judge! Your Honor!

1068
01:04:36,048 --> 01:04:39,515
Is it a crime
in this country

1069
01:04:39,517 --> 01:04:41,651
to prefer the witching hour?

1070
01:04:41,653 --> 01:04:44,253
I was born
with an internal clock.

1071
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,193
The doctor left it
inside me.

1072
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,062
I call to the stand my mother,

1073
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:54,764
Mrs. Ania Adamcyzk.

1074
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,601
Nee Smolenska...

1075
01:04:58,104 --> 01:04:59,437
"Mrs. Adamcyzk,

1076
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,239
"do you swear solemnly
that your daughter was born

1077
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:04,907
"with a rare
neurological condition

1078
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:08,212
"that renders the passage
of time and enforced illusion

1079
01:05:08,214 --> 01:05:10,747
"from the external world?"

1080
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:14,450
"Judge, please. I just can't seem
to get going until later at night.

1081
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,918
"Do you think I wanna be late?

1082
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,124
"Those people deserve a show!

1083
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,859
"And you have no idea the hell
that I've been through.

1084
01:05:22,861 --> 01:05:25,461
"I am wishing there was any
way on earth I could get going

1085
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,029
"but I just don't think
I'm gonna make it."

1086
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:29,565
Promise me, Mama, when I die,

1087
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:31,234
have the coffin arrive
half an hour late,

1088
01:05:31,236 --> 01:05:34,137
and on the side,
written in gold the letters of the words,

1089
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,740
"Sorry for the delay."

1090
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:40,076
Rebecca. My sweet Rebecca.

1091
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:43,079
Mom, stop it. You're
embarrassing me in front of my friends.

1092
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:44,747
I told you to wait in the car.

1093
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:46,414
They're making
a movie about me,

1094
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,984
and I want them
to see, like, the real me,

1095
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:51,020
so ixnay on the ebecca-ray,
okay?

1096
01:05:51,022 --> 01:05:53,156
How can you
inflict such pain?

1097
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:56,324
Can you fucking stop
it with the dramatics, Mom?

1098
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:59,327
I haven't seen you in months,
you want to play this now?

1099
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:02,798
Don't be ungrateful.
Tell me I was always there.

1100
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,133
You're right.
You deserve a pass.

1101
01:06:04,135 --> 01:06:05,968
'Cause you were
in the fucking trenches, lady.

1102
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,903
You really were, you know?

1103
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:09,073
And you were alone,
weren't you?

1104
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,340
Weren't you?

1105
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:13,744
You remember
how alone you were?

1106
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,478
You remember?

1107
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,450
You remember how you were
always, always alone?

1108
01:06:25,556 --> 01:06:27,989
Your father wanted
you to have this.

1109
01:06:27,991 --> 01:06:30,594
Where was he 15 years ago,
when I was nobody but his daughter?

1110
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:35,432
Great! Throw it in the trash.

1111
01:06:38,535 --> 01:06:42,336
- How is married life, Dirtbag?
- Get out of my face.

1112
01:06:42,338 --> 01:06:45,173
- We should go.
- Hey, hey, hey, stay, babes.

1113
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:47,209
Your loyalty will be rewarded.

1114
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:50,377
That's how it works.
Isn't that right, Ali?

1115
01:06:50,379 --> 01:06:52,180
It's funny. I didn't
know you saw me here.

1116
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:55,150
Kid, your energy is
so fucking foul,

1117
01:06:55,152 --> 01:06:56,887
I could see you in the dark.

1118
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:03,225
- Don't be mad.
- No, I'm not mad.

1119
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,894
- Come on, I'm ready.
- Yeah, you ready to rock?

1120
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,964
I was born ready.
Doesn't everyone know that by now?

1121
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:11,732
What, do you think I need to
warm up like some mere mortal?

1122
01:07:11,734 --> 01:07:13,003
I don't think so, Tim.

1123
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:15,569
I wouldn't step foot
in this joint

1124
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,739
if I wasn't ready
for v-v-victory!

1125
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:22,177
Children, come here.
Come here.

1126
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:26,881
Join me in the sacred circle
for a spiritual cleanse.

1127
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:28,551
Where's the third member
of your coven?

1128
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:33,821
Dottie OZ, you get your butt
in here this instant,

1129
01:07:33,823 --> 01:07:35,424
or you are grounded!

1130
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:37,493
How am I doing, Mom, huh?

1131
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,697
Mother of the year, right?

1132
01:07:43,733 --> 01:07:44,734
Finally.

1133
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:48,535
Hah, come here,
come here. Finally.

1134
01:07:48,537 --> 01:07:50,374
Join the circle
of energy, come on.

1135
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:52,406
Come on.

1136
01:07:52,408 --> 01:07:56,076
Anybody who does not
want to be here, look away.

1137
01:07:56,078 --> 01:07:59,013
Or you can leave. Not you.
Come here, come in.

1138
01:07:59,015 --> 01:08:00,216
Get in there, yeah.

1139
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:01,684
Good.

1140
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:10,059
Dear goddess
of creativity and positivity,

1141
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:15,129
Becky here. How's it going?

1142
01:08:15,131 --> 01:08:17,264
I am speaking to you tonight,

1143
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:19,266
not only on behalf of myself

1144
01:08:19,268 --> 01:08:21,268
but on behalf
of my little sisters,

1145
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,740
Dottie OZ, Crassie Cassie
and Roxy Rotten.

1146
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:27,540
It's a big night for them,

1147
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:30,112
so let's take care
of our Aker girls.

1148
01:08:32,048 --> 01:08:34,549
They're swell kids.

1149
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:36,551
They deserve the best.

1150
01:08:39,255 --> 01:08:40,256
As for me,

1151
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,291
I need this.

1152
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:44,826
I need this bad.

1153
01:08:47,063 --> 01:08:48,496
'Cause this is it
for old Beckster.

1154
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,367
Last train is
leaving the station,

1155
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,302
and if I'm not on it
when the whistle blows,

1156
01:08:55,304 --> 01:08:56,471
that's it for me.

1157
01:08:57,605 --> 01:09:00,073
Lights out, last call,
soup's cold,

1158
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:01,576
ice cream's melting.

1159
01:09:02,311 --> 01:09:04,112
Beer's warm. Yuck.

1160
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:07,749
Let's rally...

1161
01:09:08,516 --> 01:09:09,517
One more time.

1162
01:09:12,287 --> 01:09:14,089
And you can take
that soul I promised you.

1163
01:09:19,462 --> 01:09:21,127
Did you get it?

1164
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,496
Perfect. Start with that,
it'll be fucking phenomenal.

1165
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:25,932
Now let's burn
this fucker down

1166
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:28,937
for the big finish!

1167
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:33,538
All right. Let me...

1168
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,010
- Let me go tell them you're ready.
- Fuck yeah!

1169
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,513
Another poor decision.
I'm leaving.

1170
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,985
I'll join you
in a moment.

1171
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:47,320
Make sure
that she gets these.

1172
01:09:47,322 --> 01:09:49,057
Yeah. You're not gonna...
you're not gonna watch the show?

1173
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,459
No.

1174
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:54,693
I don't wanna see
what happens next.

1175
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:57,463
But I have one thing that
I need to say to my daughter.

1176
01:09:57,465 --> 01:09:58,967
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1177
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:02,137
Let's make it sooner.

1178
01:10:04,339 --> 01:10:06,041
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1179
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:09,710
Well,
have a great show.

1180
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:14,681
Is she gonna be okay?

1181
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:16,617
No, she's not.

1182
01:10:19,953 --> 01:10:21,254
I don't know. Um...

1183
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:23,557
Guys, I know that you don't
need a fucking...

1184
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,725
Uh, listen
to an old has-been like me,

1185
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:28,026
but you're gonna
kill it tonight,

1186
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:29,930
and after tonight, just...

1187
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:32,866
Please love each other.

1188
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:36,870
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

1189
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,604
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1190
01:10:39,606 --> 01:10:40,607
Yeah.

1191
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,958
So, is there something
we should do?

1192
01:10:58,859 --> 01:10:59,893
What else can we do?

1193
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,594
We shouldn't have asked her to
play tonight. She's not straight.

1194
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:05,466
No. I'm sorry,
we gave her a chance.

1195
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:08,366
Kill your idols.

1196
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,770
Give 'em enough rope
and they'll do it themselves.

1197
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:13,440
Right.

1198
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:18,378
I never even
wanted any of it.

1199
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:20,414
I just wanna rock with you.

1200
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:24,951
Where's my camera?

1201
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,098
The fuck is
that still doing here?

1202
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,935
He has things
he wants to say to you.

1203
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:44,904
I see no harm in that.

1204
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:48,442
Do you understand forgiveness?

1205
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:51,512
Can you understand regret?

1206
01:11:58,317 --> 01:12:01,687
You weak, stupid wimp.

1207
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:08,661
After everything

1208
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:10,930
he has put us through.

1209
01:12:17,336 --> 01:12:18,703
He used to look up to you.

1210
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:23,209
He thought you were
better than this.

1211
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:26,546
Deep down I knew you weren't.

1212
01:12:28,614 --> 01:12:30,983
You're more like your father
than you'll ever know.

1213
01:12:37,557 --> 01:12:38,658
Come on, let's go.

1214
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,641
Give it to me.

1215
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:58,107
Destroy it.

1216
01:12:58,109 --> 01:12:59,677
Beck, stop!

1217
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,945
Becky, no.

1218
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:04,180
- Ow!
- Wipe this from the people.

1219
01:13:04,182 --> 01:13:06,916
Let in the light
and forsake the darkness!

1220
01:13:06,918 --> 01:13:08,686
- Do it.
- Do you speak not to me.

1221
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:11,689
To hear your words is to
open myself to your trickery.

1222
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:15,024
I have fought you
in 11 other lives,

1223
01:13:15,026 --> 01:13:18,027
in 11 other lives,
you have destroyed me.

1224
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:19,731
Stop! You're hurting me.

1225
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:22,565
Fuck, fuck!

1226
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:25,001
I have lived across time
and I see how to defeat

1227
01:13:25,003 --> 01:13:27,705
those who will
see me destroyed.

1228
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:31,541
For the first time,
I have the power to do what must be done,

1229
01:13:31,543 --> 01:13:34,346
and for the last time
we struggle!

1230
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:49,793
Somebody, help.
Help me please.

1231
01:13:52,963 --> 01:13:54,032
We're just in a...

1232
01:13:58,303 --> 01:13:59,868
Be cool, all right. Be cool.

1233
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,304
No, no, no.

1234
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,773
- Raise your glass.
- Fuck!

1235
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,946
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1236
01:14:10,948 --> 01:14:13,849
Just take it easy.
Let's keep her okay, all right?

1237
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:16,386
- Hello!
- Howard!

1238
01:14:16,388 --> 01:14:17,919
Please, stop her.

1239
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:22,560
Gentle with her!

1240
01:14:23,294 --> 01:14:24,596
Just step back now.

1241
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:47,251
All right, okay.
Okay. Drop it.

1242
01:14:48,152 --> 01:14:49,851
She dropped it.
She dropped it.

1243
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:51,754
Can you not
hurt her please?

1244
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:57,761
Are handcuffs necessary? Look at her.

1245
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:01,598
Now, when do I get
my lousy phone call?

1246
01:15:03,267 --> 01:15:05,302
Just leave her...
Fucking don't... She's...

1247
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,443
Take a step back!

1248
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:18,148
- Hey!
- It's fucking over!

1249
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,983
Stop! I said stop filming!
Get out!

1250
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:24,154
Steven, can you stop them from filming?

1251
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:27,791
Get out of here!

1252
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:30,960
Stop!

1253
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,131
Becky?
Where are you...

1254
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,332
Ali?

1255
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,671
Becky? Beck...
Don't go out.

1256
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:55,051
Becky! Becky! Becky!

1257
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,154
Do you ever get the feeling
you're being followed?

1258
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,021
Fuck yeah!

1259
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,956
- I've been back through the ages of earth
- Back it up!

1260
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,126
And I've witnessed centuries
of conflicts.

1261
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,530
I've regressed to the moment
of my conception,

1262
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:45,299
- and I've watched myself being born!
- What the fuck?

1263
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:46,867
You know what?
That's why I'm leaving,

1264
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,102
because when I needed it,

1265
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,070
nobody ever put
a hand on my back

1266
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:53,074
and told me it was
gonna be all right!

1267
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:54,777
Dude!

1268
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:57,277
It's the little things!

1269
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,779
The little things.

1270
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:04,587
Hold on, Becky.

1271
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,388
Oh shit!

1272
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,424
Come on, Becky.

1273
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,599
Sometimes I don't even
know myself. Mom?

1274
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,368
Mom?

1275
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,270
Mom?

1276
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,715
I wanna stay home
with my baby.

1277
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,585
No tour, no record.

1278
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:47,721
I like it here.

1279
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:54,526
See. You ready for me
to take her home now?

1280
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:57,831
All right, take her.
Take her, I'm too tired.

1281
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,235
I got you.

1282
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:12,279
Fuckin' tired.

1283
01:22:31,408 --> 01:22:33,477
- Baby.
- Mommy.

1284
01:22:45,723 --> 01:22:47,157
Momma missed you.

1285
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:48,793
I missed Momma.

1286
01:22:58,402 --> 01:22:59,935
Hey, kiddo, Mommy
and Daddy need to talk.

1287
01:22:59,937 --> 01:23:01,472
Maybe you want
to play pinball?

1288
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,141
Yeah, okay.

1289
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:35,436
You look good.

1290
01:23:35,438 --> 01:23:36,439
Bullshitter.

1291
01:23:43,513 --> 01:23:45,147
I'll have a year next week.

1292
01:23:45,149 --> 01:23:46,150
I know.

1293
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,686
That's really great.

1294
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:55,358
She's been asking
about you all the time.

1295
01:23:58,829 --> 01:23:59,964
She misses me?

1296
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,865
She doesn't really know you.

1297
01:24:02,867 --> 01:24:05,535
She has no memory
of living with you.

1298
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:22,752
I had this dream.

1299
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:28,022
We were brothers
in a past life.

1300
01:24:28,024 --> 01:24:30,391
And we were Native American.

1301
01:24:30,393 --> 01:24:34,564
And you killed
all the children in our tribe.

1302
01:24:38,034 --> 01:24:41,070
And that's why I was so
horrible to you in this life.

1303
01:25:00,189 --> 01:25:01,521
Oh...

1304
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:02,624
Before I forget...

1305
01:25:07,496 --> 01:25:08,932
You need to look at those.

1306
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:15,204
- I will.
- Today. I'm taking 'em back with me, so.

1307
01:25:17,407 --> 01:25:18,807
Does it make a difference?

1308
01:25:19,641 --> 01:25:21,377
Yes. Yeah, it does.

1309
01:25:24,613 --> 01:25:27,783
Including you, do you know how
many lawsuits I have against me?

1310
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,751
Yes, I do.

1311
01:25:33,822 --> 01:25:35,258
Would you care
to say it out loud?

1312
01:25:36,892 --> 01:25:38,060
Would it make a difference?

1313
01:25:40,996 --> 01:25:42,564
Settling with M and A.

1314
01:25:43,999 --> 01:25:45,067
Child support.

1315
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:48,103
Breach of contract. Contracts.

1316
01:25:49,004 --> 01:25:51,006
Promoters. Howard.

1317
01:25:54,176 --> 01:25:58,414
- I've lost track.
- Yeah, well, don't lump us in with all of that.

1318
01:26:01,316 --> 01:26:02,317
There's nothing left.

1319
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:07,456
They gave me my band name
in exchange for publishing.

1320
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:13,962
I don't own my own music.

1321
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:17,432
I'm broke.

1322
01:26:22,871 --> 01:26:24,306
I can't give you anything.

1323
01:26:28,343 --> 01:26:30,176
I don't want you
to sell the house.

1324
01:26:30,178 --> 01:26:32,147
I just need to know that...

1325
01:26:33,714 --> 01:26:36,550
Half of whatever dollars
you find go to Tama.

1326
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:49,897
I can't leave this house.

1327
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:58,973
I can't go back
into the world.

1328
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,091
Mari's here.

1329
01:27:21,762 --> 01:27:24,732
- Excuse me, what?
- She drove up with me. She's in the car.

1330
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,105
You shouldn't have done that.

1331
01:27:33,107 --> 01:27:35,007
That's okay.
She just wants to talk.

1332
01:27:35,009 --> 01:27:36,576
She took everything I built.

1333
01:27:39,013 --> 01:27:40,214
She didn't take it.

1334
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:42,550
You lost it.

1335
01:27:43,451 --> 01:27:45,920
And besides,
you built it together.

1336
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:53,461
Well, I can't
see her like this.

1337
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:59,266
She's sober, too. She's been
through it. She understands.

1338
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:06,407
Yeah. I just need a minute.

1339
01:28:10,643 --> 01:28:13,147
Go get her, and count to 100.

1340
01:28:35,235 --> 01:28:37,103
Momma, I lost my free balls.

1341
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:44,308
Come here.

1342
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:47,447
You're
getting big, kiddo.

1343
01:28:48,648 --> 01:28:50,181
What's Daddy feeding you?

1344
01:28:50,183 --> 01:28:52,118
Chicken fingers
and fish fingers.

1345
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,085
Wow.

1346
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:55,786
I wish I had
some of those.

1347
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:56,923
And noodles.

1348
01:28:59,826 --> 01:29:01,459
I don't know
if we have any of that,

1349
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,127
but if you're not too big,

1350
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:06,166
you know, I could maybe get you
some peanut butter and jelly.

1351
01:29:07,534 --> 01:29:08,601
Peanut butter?

1352
01:29:09,202 --> 01:29:10,336
All right, all right.

1353
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:13,139
Play me a song, Mommy.

1354
01:29:17,043 --> 01:29:18,142
What kinda song?

1355
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:19,678
A song that reminds you of me.

1356
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,951
A song
that makes me think of you.

1357
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,521

Hey, M.

Hey, B.

1406
01:34:14,269 --> 01:34:17,304
Hey, Mari, did you hear?
Mom sang a song just for me.

1407
01:34:17,306 --> 01:34:18,574
Oh, yeah. I heard.

1408
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:22,375
Sweetie, why don't you
come fix lunch with Daddy?

1409
01:34:22,377 --> 01:34:24,811
Mom said she'd make me
a sandwich.

1410
01:34:24,813 --> 01:34:27,113
Dad can get this one.
I'll get the next one.

1411
01:34:27,115 --> 01:34:29,483
Okay, Momma. But you have
to make the next one.

1412
01:34:29,485 --> 01:34:30,519
Mm-hmm.

1413
01:34:51,306 --> 01:34:52,941
She's so beautiful.

1414
01:34:56,645 --> 01:34:58,645
I lost
so much time with her.

1415
01:34:58,647 --> 01:35:00,147
Yeah, but she's lucky
to have you back.

1416
01:35:01,282 --> 01:35:04,818
I had a vision of you
holding her at my funeral.

1417
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,788
I saw you
and Danny holding her hands.

1418
01:35:08,055 --> 01:35:10,458
And I was so happy
that you were her godmother.

1419
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:14,828
I mean, I've seen
my death a dozen times

1420
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:16,830
in a dozen different ways.

1421
01:35:16,832 --> 01:35:19,231
In every vision,
I'm surrounded by people.

1422
01:35:19,233 --> 01:35:20,468
I never die alone.

1423
01:35:21,636 --> 01:35:22,804
Well, you're alone now.

1424
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:26,307
Beck, you should
leave this place.

1425
01:35:27,241 --> 01:35:29,310
There's an ache in my bones.

1426
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:34,883
Oh, presents from Howard.

1427
01:35:37,886 --> 01:35:40,020
Thanks, Howard.
How's he doing?

1428
01:35:40,022 --> 01:35:43,255
Yeah, well, actually,
the Aker girls are big.

1429
01:35:43,257 --> 01:35:46,060
I mean, their new stuff ain't my cup
of tea, but they've done well for him.

1430
01:35:47,094 --> 01:35:48,162
He'd love to see ya.

1431
01:35:50,398 --> 01:35:52,833
Hey, thanks for taking
my call back then.

1432
01:35:54,569 --> 01:35:55,770
Yeah, you didn't have to.

1433
01:35:57,471 --> 01:35:58,673
Yeah, I know.

1434
01:36:01,275 --> 01:36:03,444
I was
always the bigger person.

1435
01:36:07,048 --> 01:36:08,081
Ali didn't.

1436
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,083
You didn't try to stab me.

1437
01:36:12,218 --> 01:36:13,286
Except in the back.

1438
01:36:14,355 --> 01:36:15,588
Yes, you did.

1439
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,956
How's she been?

1440
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,089
Good.

1441
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:20,193
She's put out an album
with her husband and...

1442
01:36:22,029 --> 01:36:23,229
it's pretty great.

1443
01:36:25,231 --> 01:36:27,434
- Husband?
- Yeah, Roy.

1444
01:36:28,368 --> 01:36:30,871
Yeah, they're
really amazing together.

1445
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:32,773
I should get a copy.

1446
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,744
- Well, I can just... Mine's in the car, so I can...
- I'll buy my own.

1447
01:36:37,477 --> 01:36:39,080
All right. Okay.

1448
01:36:42,482 --> 01:36:44,883
I don't think
she's mad at you anymore.

1449
01:36:44,885 --> 01:36:47,587
I don't think I'm mad at you
anymore either. You were...

1450
01:36:48,789 --> 01:36:49,924
You were horrible.

1451
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,260
But it never
made me not love you.

1452
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:56,329
I'll always love you.

1453
01:36:59,066 --> 01:37:00,734
Oh, man,
I fucking miss you, mate.

1454
01:37:07,173 --> 01:37:08,308
Oh...

1455
01:37:09,209 --> 01:37:10,910
Lauren's
seven months pregnant.

1456
01:37:11,678 --> 01:37:13,446
Oh, I heard. Danny told me.

1457
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:15,114
Oh, that's rad.

1458
01:37:15,116 --> 01:37:17,450
Yeah, it's crazy.
She's like so big.

1459
01:37:18,785 --> 01:37:20,952
I'm so happy for you.

1460
01:37:20,954 --> 01:37:22,620
You're gonna be
a really good mom.

1461
01:37:22,622 --> 01:37:24,024
- You think?
- Yeah.

1462
01:37:24,691 --> 01:37:25,759
Thank you.

1463
01:37:28,862 --> 01:37:31,998
You... still jamming then?

1464
01:37:34,467 --> 01:37:35,802
Just alone, you know.

1465
01:37:36,136 --> 01:37:37,169
A lot.

1466
01:37:37,771 --> 01:37:39,338
Well, do you wanna?

1467
01:37:41,841 --> 01:37:43,109
Sure.

1468
01:38:05,564 --> 01:38:07,901
Don't tell anybody
about what you hear, okay?

1469
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:09,566
No, I won't.

1470
01:38:09,568 --> 01:38:12,038
Just like if anybody asks you.

1471
01:38:13,505 --> 01:38:14,873
Does anybody ask?

1472
01:38:17,376 --> 01:38:18,911
Not as much as they used to.

1473
01:38:21,213 --> 01:38:22,314
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1474
01:38:23,415 --> 01:38:24,416
Only...

1475
01:38:26,552 --> 01:38:28,152
Be kind, all right?

1476
01:38:28,154 --> 01:38:29,853
Yeah, just between us.

1477
01:38:29,855 --> 01:38:31,857

Mostly junk.

1513
01:41:38,575 --> 01:41:41,344
I don't think I can let people hear this.
It's just too...

1514
01:41:42,045 --> 01:41:43,177
Too much.

1515
01:41:43,179 --> 01:41:44,381
So, what are you...

1516
01:41:45,382 --> 01:41:47,414
Stay here
and die in this house?

1517
01:41:47,416 --> 01:41:49,217
I always thought
I'd die on stage.

1518
01:41:49,219 --> 01:41:51,853
There's nothing here that can hurt
me so I can't leave the house.

1519
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:53,587
- Or else...
- Or else what?

1520
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:56,456
Somehow I cheated it.
It's very real.

1521
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:58,293
It wasn't that time,
so maybe it'll be next time.

1522
01:41:58,295 --> 01:42:00,895
- So there just can't ever be a next time.
- Nah, that's insane.

1523
01:42:00,897 --> 01:42:01,898
No, it isn't.

1524
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,935
Ya-ema once told me
that Tama would be my downfall

1525
01:42:06,937 --> 01:42:09,571
and I always thought he meant
that she would bring my downfall.

1526
01:42:10,906 --> 01:42:13,374
And it wasn't until later
that I realized

1527
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:17,711
that he meant my love
for her is my true weakness.

1528
01:42:17,713 --> 01:42:20,081
No, I don't buy any of that.

1529
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:21,782
You know, you shouldn't
still talk about him.

1530
01:42:21,784 --> 01:42:23,483
He's a fraud and he took
advantage of you

1531
01:42:23,485 --> 01:42:25,253
and lots of others,
and is in jail for it now.

1532
01:42:25,255 --> 01:42:26,455
He understood me.

1533
01:42:27,424 --> 01:42:28,624
All right, whatever.

1534
01:42:30,826 --> 01:42:33,093
You know, you don't need him,
and you never did.

1535
01:42:33,095 --> 01:42:35,162
You never knew
when to rely on others.

1536
01:42:35,164 --> 01:42:36,299
That's your weakness.

1537
01:42:37,666 --> 01:42:39,633
You know, people are waiting.
They're waiting.

1538
01:42:39,635 --> 01:42:42,035
They're waiting to see
who Becky Something really is.

1539
01:42:42,037 --> 01:42:43,105
Who is she?

1540
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:45,939
She's a woman.

1541
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:47,107
- She's a user.
- A mother.

1542
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:48,575
- She's a deadbeat.
- A person.

1543
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:49,910
A persona.

1544
01:42:49,912 --> 01:42:51,647
- But you're healthy.
- Recovering.

1545
01:42:53,115 --> 01:42:54,116
All right.

1546
01:42:55,284 --> 01:42:56,984
Well, who was Becky Something?

1547
01:42:56,986 --> 01:42:58,986
A way to hide
from Rebecca Adamcyzk.

1548
01:42:58,988 --> 01:43:00,486
- And who is she?
- I don't know.

1549
01:43:00,488 --> 01:43:02,590
Nobody has seen her
since I was 16.

1550
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:05,127
Momma, I'm bored.

1551
01:43:07,162 --> 01:43:09,096
I know, sweetheart.

1552
01:43:09,098 --> 01:43:11,365
Mommy's just catching up
with Aunt Mari.

1553
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:12,868
Can we go outside to play?

1554
01:43:17,373 --> 01:43:18,506
Yeah.

1555
01:43:21,143 --> 01:43:22,144
Let's go outside.

1556
01:43:27,349 --> 01:43:28,350
Come on.

1557
01:44:59,207 --> 01:45:01,706
It hurts.
That's how I broke my virginity.

1558
01:46:26,058 --> 01:46:27,494
Yeah.

1559
01:46:28,694 --> 01:46:31,464
- Awww.
- Look at you.

1560
01:46:32,532 --> 01:46:33,533
Hi, baby.

1561
01:46:43,909 --> 01:46:45,543
Is this a mistake?

1562
01:46:45,545 --> 01:46:47,046
Nah. Feels good.

1563
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,352
- Yeah, it's pretty.
- Yeah.

1564
01:46:54,386 --> 01:46:56,220
Yeah, it's pretty great.

1565
01:46:56,222 --> 01:46:58,589
- Ah, you all look incredible.
- Oh.

1566
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:02,926
Christ... we're not
Lady Lazarus' damn phoenix.

1567
01:47:02,928 --> 01:47:05,162
Oh, and this is my night.

1568
01:47:05,164 --> 01:47:08,198
You tried hard as you could
to torpedo the business,

1569
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,301
but somehow the company has
survived for nearly 20 years,

1570
01:47:11,303 --> 01:47:14,238
so let me throw a
living wake for you.

1571
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,106
Anybody mind if we
get a few quick photos over here?

1572
01:47:16,108 --> 01:47:17,773
- Yes.
- Oh, that's why you're here.

1573
01:47:17,775 --> 01:47:20,878
Oh, you didn't think I actually
wanted to see any of you? Come on.

1574
01:47:23,115 --> 01:47:24,116
How's this take?

1575
01:47:25,217 --> 01:47:26,719
Never seen
this place sober.

1576
01:47:27,586 --> 01:47:30,422
Yeah, I told you.
It fuckin' sucks.

1577
01:47:31,022 --> 01:47:32,023
Excellent.

1578
01:47:36,861 --> 01:47:39,028
Hi.

1579
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:43,132
- I miss her.
- All right. I'm starting to feel like a specimen.

1580
01:47:43,134 --> 01:47:45,638
We ran from the stage
when we heard you were here.

1581
01:47:47,038 --> 01:47:48,273
Oh my god.

1582
01:47:48,873 --> 01:47:49,874
Sit.

1583
01:47:53,811 --> 01:47:55,878
So, how are things?

1584
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,483
Arms, our new record
just came out.

1585
01:47:58,617 --> 01:48:00,619
Yeah. No, I know.

1586
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:04,053
Oh, I know.

1587
01:48:04,055 --> 01:48:05,921
And it's
the best one yet.

1588
01:48:05,923 --> 01:48:07,925
Everyone says the one we made
together was the best one.

1589
01:48:09,327 --> 01:48:10,926
That's because
they're fucking assholes

1590
01:48:10,928 --> 01:48:13,429
who don't want
artists to change.

1591
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:15,898
I'm serious. Do you know...
We have it on repeat.

1592
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,468
- I love it.
- Thank you.

1593
01:48:18,069 --> 01:48:19,103
Appreciate it.

1594
01:48:21,406 --> 01:48:23,908
Hey, what about you?
You doing anything after this?

1595
01:48:24,676 --> 01:48:25,975
Tonight?

1596
01:48:25,977 --> 01:48:27,643
No, like,
in the future.

1597
01:48:27,645 --> 01:48:29,612
- Um...
- That's unknown.

1598
01:48:29,614 --> 01:48:32,181
We're just trying to get
through tonight.

1599
01:48:32,183 --> 01:48:34,118
How crazy is this?
You see Zelda's here?

1600
01:48:34,818 --> 01:48:36,652
- No.
- I'm sorry. Shit.

1601
01:48:36,654 --> 01:48:38,621
Oh, man, no.
It's totally fine. It's cool.

1602
01:48:38,623 --> 01:48:41,259
We, you know, we talked and she
heard what I had to say, so...

1603
01:48:42,026 --> 01:48:43,194
Actually, is she still around?

1604
01:48:44,128 --> 01:48:45,163
Down the hall.

1605
01:48:46,698 --> 01:48:49,332
Maybe this...
Maybe this means something.

1606
01:48:49,334 --> 01:48:50,766
Yes.

1607
01:48:50,768 --> 01:48:51,769
Excuse me.

1608
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:56,441
Something She?

1609
01:48:57,174 --> 01:48:59,140
You're on in 20.

1610
01:48:59,142 --> 01:49:01,843
It's so nice to see
you guys together.

1611
01:49:01,845 --> 01:49:03,713
She looks
like she's doing great.

1612
01:49:03,715 --> 01:49:06,549
Yeah. Yeah,
she actually is, I think.

1613
01:49:06,551 --> 01:49:09,354
You know there's, like, a lot of shit
going on tonight, she cool with that?

1614
01:49:10,655 --> 01:49:13,121
Yeah. I mean,
probably, maybe...

1615
01:49:13,123 --> 01:49:15,558
- We'll see.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1616
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,226
I mean, people are
getting really fucked up.

1617
01:49:18,228 --> 01:49:19,961
- Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.
- Yeah, we got her.

1618
01:49:19,963 --> 01:49:20,964
Don't worry.

1619
01:49:38,248 --> 01:49:39,249
Becky!

1620
01:49:39,751 --> 01:49:41,649
Oh, fuck.

1621
01:49:41,651 --> 01:49:43,587
- You look awesome.
- Yeah, Viv, I thought you'd be here.

1622
01:49:44,822 --> 01:49:46,423
- For Howard, right?
- Yeah, right on.

1623
01:49:48,058 --> 01:49:50,258
- You wanna hang?
- No, no.

1624
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,293
I just was looking for Zelda.

1625
01:49:52,295 --> 01:49:54,362
She's partying with us.
She just stepped out.

1626
01:49:54,364 --> 01:49:55,697
Wait for her.

1627
01:49:55,699 --> 01:49:58,735
No. No, I can't. But, um,
just tell her I was looking for her.

1628
01:50:00,036 --> 01:50:01,169
It's good to see you.

1629
01:50:01,171 --> 01:50:02,370
Yeah, yeah.

1630
01:50:02,372 --> 01:50:03,705
You doing the thing after?

1631
01:50:03,707 --> 01:50:06,376
Maybe. Probably not, because,
um, my daughter's here.

1632
01:50:07,677 --> 01:50:08,909
- How's Tama?
- She's really good.

1633
01:50:08,911 --> 01:50:10,845
She's good. She's really big.

1634
01:50:10,847 --> 01:50:13,181
- She's like seven, so.
- I wanna see her.

1635
01:50:13,183 --> 01:50:14,551
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll...

1636
01:50:15,084 --> 01:50:16,520
I'll come find you.

1637
01:50:32,536 --> 01:50:33,601
Change your mind?

1638
01:50:33,603 --> 01:50:36,038
No, I'm sorry.
I just didn't...

1639
01:50:36,939 --> 01:50:38,374
I didn't realize it was...

1640
01:50:40,644 --> 01:50:43,110
Becky Something,
as I live and breathe.

1641
01:50:43,112 --> 01:50:45,045
Hey, Z.

1642
01:50:45,047 --> 01:50:46,648
Yeah, I was
just looking for you.

1643
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:47,784
What's it all about?

1644
01:50:48,584 --> 01:50:50,219
Hey, are you guys on soon?

1645
01:50:51,387 --> 01:50:52,787
Well, well...

1646
01:50:52,789 --> 01:50:54,455
Never thought I'd live
to see the day.

1647
01:50:54,457 --> 01:50:55,991
Yeah, you and me both, girl.

1648
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:58,961
You look good.

1649
01:51:00,663 --> 01:51:01,664
Really good.

1650
01:51:02,465 --> 01:51:03,499
Um...

1651
01:51:04,233 --> 01:51:05,999
You looking for me?

1652
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:08,937
Yeah. You can say no,
and you probably will,

1653
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:11,071
but I was just gonna have
a little seance right now.

1654
01:51:11,073 --> 01:51:12,639
Just like a very pure,

1655
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:15,309
just trying to find a clearing
on my path before we, like,

1656
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:16,410
you know, do this thing,

1657
01:51:16,412 --> 01:51:18,345
and I know
it's only this song...

1658
01:51:18,347 --> 01:51:20,514
So you'd probably just...

1659
01:51:20,516 --> 01:51:22,583
I wanted to be
surrounded by my...

1660
01:51:22,585 --> 01:51:25,421
By some women, because I thought
that that might help with...

1661
01:51:26,087 --> 01:51:27,088
Relax.

1662
01:51:27,623 --> 01:51:28,624
I'd love to.

1663
01:51:30,926 --> 01:51:32,528
- Yeah?
- It's cool.

1664
01:51:33,496 --> 01:51:34,597
Time passes.

1665
01:51:35,464 --> 01:51:36,465
Yeah.

1666
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,099
- Yeah, yeah, that's... All right. Cool.
- All right.

1667
01:51:40,101 --> 01:51:41,537
Yeah. After you.

1668
01:51:54,817 --> 01:51:56,384
I'm Rebecca Adamcyzk.

1669
01:51:57,452 --> 01:51:58,787
I rely on the strength
of others for support.

1670
01:52:02,223 --> 01:52:04,125

Thank you
for being here with me.

1688
01:53:04,752 --> 01:53:07,285
- Your name really is Zelda?
- Mm-hmm.

1689
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:08,890
Fuck, that's so cool.

1690
01:53:25,572 --> 01:53:27,207
No matter what happens next,

1691
01:53:28,076 --> 01:53:30,410
thank you
for letting me be who I am.

1692
01:53:32,046 --> 01:53:34,479
I've tried and I've tried
and I've tried,

1693
01:53:34,481 --> 01:53:35,782
and you've all
stuck with me...

1694
01:53:38,585 --> 01:53:39,586
Till the very end.

1695
01:53:46,727 --> 01:53:47,728
Well...

1696
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:51,765
I better finish getting ready.

1697
01:53:53,467 --> 01:53:55,936
- Thanks for letting me crash.
- You're very welcome.

1698
01:53:58,472 --> 01:54:02,173
I, uh... I know I wasn't always
front row at the Becky show.

1699
01:54:02,175 --> 01:54:04,976
Come on. You're backstage
at the Becky show.

1700
01:54:04,978 --> 01:54:06,077
Yeah, you are.

1701
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:10,651
All right. See you in a few.

1702
01:54:13,252 --> 01:54:14,786
Hey,
we should go chill.

1703
01:54:14,788 --> 01:54:16,855
- I'm beat.
- We're watching her set though.

1704
01:54:16,857 --> 01:54:20,357
Oh, shit, yeah. That's one
thing we absolutely cannot miss tonight.

1705
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:22,963
Wow. Well, I hope
we don't disappoint. Pressure.

1706
01:54:23,497 --> 01:54:24,663
You never do.

1707
01:54:28,434 --> 01:54:30,837
What did you think she meant
by "Until the very end"?

1708
01:54:32,005 --> 01:54:33,372
It's just
something people say.

1709
01:54:34,675 --> 01:54:36,175
Yeah, maybe. Or...

1710
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:39,144
What are you thinking?

1711
01:54:39,146 --> 01:54:40,879
No. I mean,
what did we just do?

1712
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:42,281
What did Becky want from us?

1713
01:54:42,983 --> 01:54:44,685
Strength to overcome, maybe.

1714
01:54:45,886 --> 01:54:47,484
Yeah. Huh. Or...

1715
01:54:47,486 --> 01:54:50,690
No. No, she's open.
Not high.

1716
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:53,192
She was good.

1717
01:54:54,027 --> 01:54:55,126
Yeah.

1718
01:54:55,128 --> 01:54:57,329
Yeah. Yeah, I hope you're right.

1719
01:54:58,965 --> 01:55:00,499
No, of course, of course.

1720
01:55:01,567 --> 01:55:02,833
All right. Enjoy the show.

1721
01:55:02,835 --> 01:55:04,137
- Can I get one?
- Of course, yes.

1722
01:55:04,904 --> 01:55:06,403
- Thank you.
- Danny! Bye guys.

1723
01:55:06,405 --> 01:55:08,539
Hey, how's it going, Zelda.

1724
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:09,673
Great to see you.

1725
01:55:09,675 --> 01:55:12,242
- Hi. You must be Becky's mother.
- Nice to see you.

1726
01:55:12,244 --> 01:55:13,877
From the down the hall,
I could have sworn it was her.

1727
01:55:13,879 --> 01:55:14,978
Oh, right.

1728
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,513
Hi, beauty.

1729
01:55:16,515 --> 01:55:19,049
- And you remember my wife Tiffany?
- Congratulations.

1730
01:55:19,051 --> 01:55:20,851
- Thank you.
- Look at you. Hi, love.

1731
01:55:20,853 --> 01:55:21,919
- I'm Zelda.
- Roy.

1732
01:55:21,921 --> 01:55:23,754
- Miss Z, can I get you anything?
- I'm sorry.

1733
01:55:23,756 --> 01:55:25,224
No, I'm all right, love.
Thank you.

1734
01:55:26,025 --> 01:55:27,925
So, how's radio, Dirtbag?

1735
01:55:27,927 --> 01:55:29,827
You know, it is good.
You know, we're merging

1736
01:55:29,829 --> 01:55:32,162
with the competition.
Payout, can't complain.

1737
01:55:32,164 --> 01:55:33,697
Have you seen the girls yet?

1738
01:55:33,699 --> 01:55:35,766
I just came from their room, actually.
Want me to show you where it is?

1739
01:55:35,768 --> 01:55:37,167
No, I think I can remember.

1740
01:55:37,169 --> 01:55:38,769
- Okay.
- Are we supposed to go through the balcony?

1741
01:55:38,771 --> 01:55:40,904
Oh, nonsense.
Come watch it from back here.

1742
01:55:40,906 --> 01:55:43,173
I'll show you. Come on.
Come with me.

1743
01:55:43,175 --> 01:55:46,577
Ali is such a great singer.
I always knew.

1744
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:48,679
I really love the album
you two did.

1745
01:55:48,681 --> 01:55:50,848
- Ah, you're the one.
- Oh, stop it. Here it is.

1746
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,750
Guys, enjoy the show.

1747
01:55:52,752 --> 01:55:54,218
Stop it, it's marvelous.

1748
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:55,753
- Seriously.
- Appreciate it.

1749
01:55:55,755 --> 01:55:56,887
All right, enjoy.

1750
01:55:56,889 --> 01:56:00,224
You all right?
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

1751
01:56:00,226 --> 01:56:02,726
- Just who I wanted to see!
- Aunt Mari!

1752
01:56:02,728 --> 01:56:04,327
- Where's Rebecca?
- Ah!

1753
01:56:06,698 --> 01:56:09,632
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1754
01:56:09,634 --> 01:56:12,202
- Congratulations to you too.
- She's, um...

1755
01:56:12,204 --> 01:56:14,138
She's just gone to unwind
or something before we play.

1756
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:15,906
- Oh, yeah? Which is when?
- Ten minutes.

1757
01:56:15,908 --> 01:56:17,473
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah.

1758
01:56:17,475 --> 01:56:19,408
I mean, she's probably
meditating or something.

1759
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,745
Something She?

1760
01:56:21,981 --> 01:56:23,379
Eight minutes
until Something She.

1761
01:56:23,381 --> 01:56:25,548
Eight! Geez, all right.

1762
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:27,050
Well, I'm gonna
go look for her.

1763
01:56:27,052 --> 01:56:28,553
I love you. Wait here.

1764
01:56:37,562 --> 01:56:39,231
- Mari, hey.
- Hey, V.

1765
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,798
- Have you seen Becky?
- I saw her.

1766
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,467
- When?
- Like two minutes ago in our room.

1767
01:56:44,469 --> 01:56:46,936
- Okay. But you're all here.
- Yeah, I left.

1768
01:56:46,938 --> 01:56:48,306
Right, but when did you go?

1769
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:55,478
I'm sure it's fine.

1770
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:58,313
- Did you see how stoned Vivvy was?
- Yeah. So, that's Vivvy.

1771
01:56:58,315 --> 01:56:59,982
Becky shouldn't
be hanging with her.

1772
01:56:59,984 --> 01:57:03,119
Okay, I think she just said,
"Hey Mar."

1773
01:57:03,121 --> 01:57:05,154
Yeah, but it's not good to be
around her. It's not good.

1774
01:57:05,156 --> 01:57:07,322
It's fine. Give her the benefit.
She's probably in her room.

1775
01:57:07,324 --> 01:57:09,491
- No...
- Just... no. Then she's somewhere else.

1776
01:57:09,493 --> 01:57:12,263
Look, just relax. You're just
nervous about the show.

1777
01:57:12,864 --> 01:57:14,331
Did we lose Becky already?

1778
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,303
I mean, well, that is the
question at the moment, actually.

1779
01:57:20,604 --> 01:57:21,773
I was joking.

1780
01:57:23,373 --> 01:57:27,642
Oh, goddammit. Not this again.
One smooth night

1781
01:57:27,644 --> 01:57:29,411
after all these years.
Is that too much to ask?

1782
01:57:29,413 --> 01:57:30,980
Look, I'm sure
she's back right now.

1783
01:57:30,982 --> 01:57:33,517
Oh. I'll just go,
say hello to Dick, all right?

1784
01:57:35,286 --> 01:57:36,353
I'm having a stroke.

1785
01:57:38,922 --> 01:57:40,022
Where is she?

1786
01:57:40,024 --> 01:57:41,356
Uh, Tama had to use
the bathroom

1787
01:57:41,358 --> 01:57:42,524
so Ania said she looked there.

1788
01:57:42,526 --> 01:57:43,794
The Aker girls?

1789
01:57:44,494 --> 01:57:46,361
Uh, negative.

1790
01:57:46,363 --> 01:57:47,729
I just saw them.

1791
01:57:47,731 --> 01:57:49,898
All right, that's five minutes, folks.
Five minutes till show.

1792
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,068
- Thank you.
- Vivvy?

1793
01:57:51,501 --> 01:57:52,502
Uh, no.

1794
01:57:54,071 --> 01:57:56,373
We have to play.
So let's just...

1795
01:57:57,574 --> 01:57:58,707
let's just go to the stage,

1796
01:57:58,709 --> 01:58:00,542
and we'll find
Becky waiting there.

1797
01:58:00,544 --> 01:58:02,379
- Okay?
- Yeah. Sure, we will.

1798
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:12,890
- Why don't you do your thing, okay?
- Okay.

1799
01:58:14,091 --> 01:58:15,690
We'll go find our seats?

1800
01:58:15,692 --> 01:58:17,094
- They're on...
- Seats? That way, yeah.

1801
01:58:22,532 --> 01:58:25,367
Holy shit, look.
She's there. She's ready.

1802
01:58:25,369 --> 01:58:26,701
All right, four minutes.

1803
01:58:26,703 --> 01:58:29,170
- Fuck.
- Why is she standing like that?

1804
01:58:29,172 --> 01:58:30,607
- I don't know.
- She's nervous.

1805
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,277
- I know I am.
- She's nervous?

1806
01:58:35,045 --> 01:58:36,046
She's alone.

1807
01:58:44,054 --> 01:58:45,519
- We need to get her out.
- Yeah.

1808
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:47,024
- Should I...
- Just us.

1809
01:59:39,408 --> 01:59:40,409
Well?

1810
01:59:41,444 --> 01:59:42,743
- She'll be fine.
- Three minutes.

1811
01:59:42,745 --> 01:59:44,178
"She'll be fine." What does
that mean, "She'll be fine"?

1812
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:46,080
- She'll be fine.
- Is she straight? Is she messed up?

1813
01:59:46,082 --> 01:59:47,147
- Can she perform?
- She's good!

1814
01:59:47,149 --> 01:59:49,615
Greg, hey! Find Zelda.
See if she can get on.

1815
01:59:49,617 --> 01:59:51,986
Zelda's not going on. We are.

1816
01:59:51,988 --> 01:59:53,488
Then tell me,
what does this mean?

1817
01:59:54,656 --> 01:59:56,759
It means whatever you want
it to mean, Danny Boy.

1818
02:00:01,596 --> 02:00:02,630
Did she take something?

1819
02:00:04,133 --> 02:00:05,765
- Guess what?
- Huh?

1820
02:00:05,767 --> 02:00:06,835
Tama's here.

1821
02:00:33,028 --> 02:00:35,561
I wanted to say good luck
before your concert, Mommy.

1822
02:00:35,563 --> 02:00:36,831
Thank you, sweetheart.

1823
02:00:38,166 --> 02:00:39,167
Thank you.

1824
02:00:44,606 --> 02:00:46,741
Go to Daddy, okay? Go on.

1825
02:01:00,321 --> 02:01:02,588
I just have to be me,
you know.

1826
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:06,359
And I know I've caused you
a lot of pain, I'm sorry.

1827
02:01:06,361 --> 02:01:08,327
And I don't know
how to do it like that.

1828
02:01:08,329 --> 02:01:10,163
For myself,
I don't know how to do it...

1829
02:01:10,165 --> 02:01:13,168
I can't. I don't know
how to do it, I'm sorry.

1830
02:01:14,169 --> 02:01:15,734
It's okay.

1831
02:01:15,736 --> 02:01:17,736
Five seconds, guys.
Forty-five to show.

1832
02:01:17,738 --> 02:01:19,571
Howard, are you gonna
introduce them in?

1833
02:01:19,573 --> 02:01:21,376
- Here goes nothing.
- Oh, Becky.

1834
02:01:25,579 --> 02:01:26,713
Becky, darling,

1835
02:01:28,016 --> 02:01:29,017
are you okay?

1836
02:01:31,419 --> 02:01:32,851
Thank you.

1837
02:01:32,853 --> 02:01:33,887
Thanks very much.

1838
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:38,957
<i>I, uh... I first saw
this next band</i>

1839
02:01:38,959 --> 02:01:41,059
<i>almost ten...</i>

1840
02:01:41,061 --> 02:01:43,264
<i>God, no, eleven years ago.</i>

1841
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:46,133
<i>Uh, they were opening for...</i>

1842
02:01:47,569 --> 02:01:49,435
<i>Well, it doesn't matter
who they were opening for,</i>

1843
02:01:49,437 --> 02:01:51,437
<i>'cause I left
right after their set,</i>

1844
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:53,306
<i>ran backstage,
dropped to my knees,</i>

1845
02:01:53,308 --> 02:01:55,577
<i>and begged
to let me sign them.</i>

1846
02:01:57,044 --> 02:02:00,212
And... And this woman,

1847
02:02:00,214 --> 02:02:02,747
<i>this once in a lifetime,
never been anyone like her in the world,</i>

1848
02:02:02,749 --> 02:02:06,318
<i>firebrand of a woman.
Her hair dyed bright blue.</i>

1849
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:09,423
Rebecca never knew how to go
out there, exposed and alone.

1850
02:02:10,224 --> 02:02:11,559
She never knew how.

1851
02:02:14,428 --> 02:02:16,661
Yeah, but you're
not alone now.

1852
02:02:16,663 --> 02:02:18,964
- Yeah, you are never alone.
- Okay.

1853
02:02:18,966 --> 02:02:21,633
- <i>Maybe their ninth...</i>
- Yeah, okay.

1854
02:02:21,635 --> 02:02:23,570
<i>So, you know what she does?</i>

1855
02:02:25,239 --> 02:02:27,339
<i>She looks me in the eye</i>

1856
02:02:27,341 --> 02:02:29,174
<i>and says "Who the fuck are you</i>

1857
02:02:29,176 --> 02:02:31,176
<i>"to want to work
with a star like me?"</i>

1858
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:34,114
<i>We have
been together ever since,</i>

1859
02:02:35,415 --> 02:02:37,084
<i>through the ups and the downs,</i>

1860
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:41,522
<i>a... friendly lawsuit or two.</i>

1861
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:44,024
<i>But mostly...</i>

1862
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:46,925
<i>Mostly it's the good times</i>

1863
02:02:46,927 --> 02:02:48,028
<i>that I think about.</i>

1864
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:52,330
<i>Both of them.</i>

1865
02:02:52,332 --> 02:02:55,200
<i>No, seriously, I love and respect
the hell out of these women.</i>

1866
02:02:55,202 --> 02:02:57,135
<i>And I'm proud
to call them family.</i>

1867
02:02:57,137 --> 02:03:00,004
<i>So please,
give a paragon welcome</i>

1868
02:03:00,006 --> 02:03:04,442
<i>for the first time together
in nearly four years,</i>

1869
02:03:04,444 --> 02:03:06,344
<i>Becky Something,</i>

1870
02:03:06,346 --> 02:03:07,845
<i>Ali van der Wolff,
Marielle Hell.</i>

1871
02:03:07,847 --> 02:03:10,549
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
Something She!</i>

1872
02:03:15,455 --> 02:03:17,491
<i>Something She!</i>

1873
02:03:18,358 --> 02:03:19,957
Is it today?

1874
02:03:19,959 --> 02:03:21,292
Is today the day
I don't make it?

1875
02:03:21,294 --> 02:03:23,727
No, today's not the day.

1876
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:25,198
- What do you think?
- <i>Get ready for the band!</i>

1877
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:33,170
<i>Come on out, ladies.</i>

1878
02:03:35,341 --> 02:03:36,475
<i>Come on.</i>

1879
02:03:37,043 --> 02:03:38,044
<i>There they are.</i>

1880
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:17,080
<i>Where you been?</i>

1881
02:04:19,452 --> 02:04:22,419
<i>Thanks for
the bullshit speech, Howard.</i>

1882
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:24,423
<i>I don't remember it happening
like that at all.</i>

1883
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:26,626
Do you remember it at all?

1884
02:04:27,727 --> 02:04:29,395
<i>I do remember the blue hair.</i>

1885
02:04:31,397 --> 02:04:35,098
<i>Uh, wow. What to say,
what to say, what to say!</i>

1886
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:38,469
<i>Uh, I know this is
all about Howard,</i>

1887
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:40,473
<i>uh, but I've heard
enough kind words about him,</i>

1888
02:04:41,373 --> 02:04:42,673
<i>you know, to last a lifetime.</i>

1889
02:04:42,675 --> 02:04:44,642
<i>Those are ones
he just says himself.</i>

1890
02:04:46,778 --> 02:04:50,382
<i>What else is there, what else?</i>

1891
02:04:53,485 --> 02:04:55,387
<i>Gosh, it took me a lifetime...</i>

1892
02:04:58,323 --> 02:05:00,625
<i>It took me a lifetime
to realize that, uh...</i>

1893
02:05:03,094 --> 02:05:05,662
<i>That, uh, without people
like these women up here</i>

1894
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:07,330
<i>beside me, nobody's nothin'.</i>

1895
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:18,408
<i>And, um, I know that you've heard
we haven't done this in a while,</i>

1896
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,980
<i>and I guess I'm a little, you
know, pee-shy or whatever, and...</i>

1897
02:05:23,847 --> 02:05:25,581
<i>I don't really even
talk to them about this,</i>

1898
02:05:25,583 --> 02:05:28,451
<i>and I'm sure Howard has some
big bullshit finale planned</i>

1899
02:05:28,453 --> 02:05:30,586
<i>that we're not included in,
and I don't want to ruin it.</i>

1900
02:05:30,588 --> 02:05:31,987
<i>But, uh, I'm gonna,</i>

1901
02:05:31,989 --> 02:05:33,824
<i>'cause I've been
through some shit. So...</i>

1902
02:05:34,492 --> 02:05:35,957
<i>Uh, there's lots of people</i>

1903
02:05:35,959 --> 02:05:37,760
<i>that I wouldn't
be here without,</i>

1904
02:05:37,762 --> 02:05:40,430
<i>and, um, there's like,
only eight of 'em here tonight</i>

1905
02:05:40,432 --> 02:05:42,030
<i>and only four
of 'em are musicians</i>

1906
02:05:42,032 --> 02:05:44,434
<i>who are not in this band.</i>

1907
02:05:44,436 --> 02:05:48,673
<i>So, um, would Crassie Cassie, Roxie Rotten,</i>

1908
02:05:49,139 --> 02:05:50,939
<i>and Dottie OZ,</i>

1909
