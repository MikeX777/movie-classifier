1
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,497
-Hello?
- It's me. It's done.

2
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:31,332
I need you in Brooklyn.

3
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:35,126
An lranian jeweler
is giving me problems.

4
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,367
He needs to disappear.

5
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,845
He's here in Little Odessa.

6
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:44,012
Brooklyn's no good for me.
You know that.

7
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,562
You owe us a debt.

8
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:50,008
It's important.

9
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:53,768
Don't you want to see
the old neighborhood again?

10
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,807
I'll call you when I get there.

11
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,846
I'm taking you in, Lee.

12
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,442
Not a chance.

13
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,643
Come on out. Or do I have
to come in and get you?

14
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,595
- That's the whole story, Arch.
- All of it?

15
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,880
You didn't kill him.
I did.

16
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:26,319
Long time ago.

17
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:29,155
The day I looked away
and hoped he'd change.

18
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,472
I'll have to tell Jen.

19
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,630
I'd like to tell her myself.

20
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,473
- So, is that it?
- That's it.

21
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,494
Hold the doors.

22
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,541
What?

23
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:40,983
Huh?

24
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:51,618
Reuben, get the tea.

25
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,933
It's me, Ma.

26
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,280
Hey.

27
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,119
That will kill you.

28
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,714
- Did you get the syrup?
- Hmm?

29
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,354
I forgot, sorry.

30
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,427
How is Mama?

31
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,473
She all right?

32
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:12,023
You shouldn't smoke.

33
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,761
Holy shit.
What the fuck is he doing here?

34
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,878
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

35
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,197
- Come on. Get out of the car.
- What are you doing?

36
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,241
- Get out of the car!
- What are you doing?!

37
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:48,551
Son of a bitch.

38
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,024
Hey.

39
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,543
- You're late.
- I know. I was with Mom.

40
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:26,941
I am going to be gone
for awhile, all right?

41
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,539
- Okay.
- Finish counting the pennies

42
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,459
and put them in a box.

43
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,572
Hey.

44
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:42,177
What is it?

45
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,456
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

46
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,611
If I let you in on something...

47
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,259
- promise to keep it a secret?
- Sure.

48
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,535
Don't say "sure,"
this is big.

49
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,648
Okay. What is it?

50
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,334
- I can't tell you.
- Come on. You can't say that.

51
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,977
Yeah?
Well, it's gonna cost you.

52
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,011
How much?

53
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,928
Those.
The cigarettes right there.

54
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,083
- Those? Okay, how about one?
- No.

55
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,689
- Two cartons every week.
- Fine, fine, man. What is it?

56
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,647
You never heard this
from me, understood?

57
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:20,800
- Yeah.
- You tell anybody, you go to the dump.

58
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,359
- I know. All right, what is it?
- Your brother's here.

59
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,407
In Brooklyn.

60
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,925
Where is he?

61
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,963
I saw him go into the Metropole
in Queens.

62
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,356
That's all I can say, kid.

63
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,982
Shh! Shh!

64
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,587
Go to bed.
Go back to bed.

65
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,183
Close the door.
She will be all right.

66
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,625
Shh.

67
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:58,283
Josh.

68
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:01,881
Josh. Hey.

69
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,842
It's me.

70
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:10,837
Get out of here.

71
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:13,881
Okay, then we'll meet later.

72
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,191
It's not safe.

73
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,636
Then we'll meet later,
somewhere else.

74
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,834
I can't do that.
I'm sorry.

75
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,070
You look good, though.
You're growing.

76
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:33,512
Mom's gonna die.
She's got a brain tumor.

77
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,707
- Does Pop still work at the stand?
- Yeah.

78
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,103
Be on the boardwalk,
near Nathan's

79
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:45,662
- tomorrow at 4:00.
- Okay.

80
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,550
Come here.

81
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,466
How'd you know I was here?

82
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,904
I won't do anything.
Just tell me.

83
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,940
Sasha Ronov told me.

84
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,302
Nobody can know I'm here.

85
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:05,822
Not your friends, not any
other relatives, nobody.

86
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,976
Don't discuss it with Sasha
or anybody else.

87
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,136
- Okay.
- Okay?

88
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,772
See you tomorrow.

89
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,737
Fucking Mickey Mouse.

90
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:00,091
- Who'd you tell about me?
- Nobody.

91
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:02,082
Don't insult me or I'll cut it off!

92
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,162
I told your brother
and the guys.

93
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,446
I told Victor and Yuri,
but they won't say anything.

94
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,486
- Yuri still run the station?
- Yeah.

95
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,524
You going there now?

96
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,357
Get up!
Get the fuck up!

97
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,363
Let's go.

98
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,837
Volkoff's looking for you.

99
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,875
I know that.

100
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,069
This asshole picked
the wrong fucking time

101
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,227
to be hanging around
my house.

102
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,273
Bad fucking luck.

103
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:54,352
He wants you bad.
He comes around all the time

104
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,267
asking where you are.

105
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,312
We got a problem.

106
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:01,671
You all know I'm here
and that's a problem.

107
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,709
We're gonna work together.

108
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:07,669
Don't worry, I've got
some money for you.

109
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:11,347
What if we don't want to help?

110
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:46,055
Reuben?

111
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,780
- Hey!
- Hey, Ma.

112
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,574
I haven't had much to say.

113
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,490
You were always so quiet.

114
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:07,011
Aw, so introverted.

115
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,607
You don't go out with girls?

116
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,447
Uh, none of them
will go out with me.

117
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:19,410
Oh, no you mustn't say that.

118
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:22,966
Why, don't say that.

119
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,967
Oh, you're beautiful.

120
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:28,007
- You think I'm beautiful.
- Yes.

121
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,286
Stop it!
Reuben, you are beautiful.

122
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:46,761
What's the matter?

123
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,801
Nothing.

124
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,880
I know.
I love you too.

125
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,479
Ma, does it hurt?

126
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,908
Hey.

127
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,264
It's fucking--
it's fucking cold out here.

128
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,065
So you're gonna tell me
about Ma?

129
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,064
She got sick
like five months ago.

130
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:49,623
- What happened?
- She got some headaches.

131
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,096
They said she'd be dead
by now.

132
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,341
- Nathan's.
- Oh.

133
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,172
- You bar mitzvahed?
- Yeah.

134
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:07,459
- You get a lot of money?
- Not too much.

135
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,100
You can make a lot of money
from those things, you know?

136
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,570
All your friends bring you money--
all your relatives.

137
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,378
- You got friends?
- They're all schwartzes.

138
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,649
What about the girls?

139
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,649
They're schwartzes too.
Pop says not to hang with them.

140
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,650
I wanna come home
and see Ma.

141
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,164
They think you're dead.

142
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:33,008
What'd you do?

143
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,766
- Did some things.
- There's a lot of rumors.

144
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,727
Biggest killer
in the world's a rumor.

145
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,406
Brooklyn
should be called "Rumors."

146
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,448
- How you doing, you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:55,845
We'll do something this week.

148
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,682
Okay, let's go.

149
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,720
Let's go home now.

150
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:17,996
Son of a bitch.

151
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:20,037
I'll race you.

152
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:50,825
Don't worry.
She doesn't look so bad.

153
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,778
Grandma, calm down.
Come on, Josh.

154
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:21,299
It's no big deal.
Come on.

155
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,016
Did you let him in?

156
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,893
Did you let him in?

157
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:52,485
He gets what I got,
is that it?

158
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,968
- Come on, Josh.
- Don't you fucking hit him!

159
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,612
Get out of my house.

160
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:00,964
- Get out of my house...
- Josh! Come on!

161
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,360
or I swear to you, you'll get belted.
Get out of my house.

162
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:06,329
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

163
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,365
- You fucking man.
- Fuck you!

164
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:10,405
- Get out of my house.
- I'll fucking kill you!

165
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,446
You fucking lay a hand on me!

166
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:16,317
Get out.

167
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:19,322
Get out, I said!

168
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,875
Murderer.

169
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,921
Out!

170
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,919
You go to your room!

171
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:41,780
Alla Shustervich.

172
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:44,813
Alla Shustervich.

173
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,614
It's Joshua Shapira.

174
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,216
What do you want from me?

175
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,168
I wanted to see you.

176
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:03,214
But I didn't do anything.

177
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,446
I know that.

178
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,210
How you doing?

179
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,571
I'm gonna go home now.

180
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:13,611
I heard about your pop.

181
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:18,042
- I'm sorry.
- Heard about you.

182
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:20,885
Couldn't come here anymore,
if that's what you mean.

183
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:22,928
Then why are you here?

184
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:24,764
I'm leaving soon.

185
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,966
I wanted to see everything.

186
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:32,363
Alexa told me about you.

187
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,440
Said you left because
of Boris Volkoff.

188
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,916
You've been here long enough.
You know if Mr. Boris

189
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,919
don't like somebody,
he can keep them away.

190
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,600
- That's all it is.
- So you didn't do anything?

191
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:44,154
Well, don't go
telling people I'm here.

192
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:49,155
I just wanted to tell you
that I understand.

193
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:52,797
'Cause here I am.
I can't talk to anybody...

194
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,839
or do anything.

195
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:57,837
You know?

196
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:01,278
I hope I see you again.

197
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,953
Anyway, you can go
home now.

198
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,226
- Hello?
- Reuben.

199
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:19,306
- Yeah?
- It's Joshua.

200
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:21,352
- Hey.
- Be home at 10:00.

201
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:23,392
- We'll go to a movie, okay?
- Okay.

202
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:26,386
- You like the movies?
- Yeah, what are we seeing?

203
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:28,430
Whatever.
Be home at 10:00.

204
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:30,468
- Bye.
- Okay.

205
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:04,119
He was making a call in the phone booth
when the mice found him.

206
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:09,478
Through the head.
No one saw it.

207
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:13,040
No one saw it happen.

208
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,674
I don't even know
who would want to do this.

209
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,757
Busy.

210
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,828
Reuben.

211
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,421
My name is Alla,
you remember me?

212
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:58,547
- I was friends with Sasha.
- Yeah.

213
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,589
I have to talk to you. Your brother
came to see me the other day.

214
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,307
Have you seen him?

215
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:05,300
'Cause I really need
to talk to him.

216
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:09,221
- You like movies?
- Yeah.

217
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:11,583
Meet us on the corner
of 3rd and Brighton.

218
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,942
- 10:00.
- Okay.

219
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:16,982
Okay. See you.

220
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:27,292
- But I need it!
- I don't have your fucking leg. Jesus.

221
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:30,054
Come on! Give me my leg!

222
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:33,259
Shut up! I gotta deal with this fucking
crazy man, here, and you don't help.

223
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:35,012
Look, I can't be hopping
around like this!

224
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,888
I don't have your fucking leg. Would
you please get the fuck outta here?

225
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,375
You got my leg.

226
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,335
- He's got my leg.
- Fucking nut.

227
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:57,051
Our man is Ahmad Pahlevi.

228
00:29:58,174 --> 00:30:00,244
Real camel jockey.

229
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:04,246
We've heard about him.
He'll be tough, the mice love him.

230
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,767
- So?
- So he's untouchable.

231
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:12,439
The cops are pussy cats.
You guys know that.

232
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:16,244
This guy is nothing
but some dumb stukach.

233
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,717
Make him go bye-bye.
You'll see what happens.

234
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:21,639
He's ratted on so many people,
every asshole in the city,

235
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,557
including the mayor,
will think it was the ltalians

236
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:25,365
or the schwartzes who did it.

237
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:30,273
Empty the whole round into his head.
It's bye-bye, Ayatollah.

238
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:32,479
You're gonna need guns.
You got guns?

239
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,317
I can get 'em.
Mr. Boris, believe it or not.

240
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:38,280
Keep them small specials,
throw aways.

241
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:42,554
It won't be long before
Volkoff finds out I'm here.

242
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,029
I think one of his guys
recognized me.

243
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,509
- How do you know that?
- Because he sees everything.

244
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,988
So what happened
to the guy that saw you?

245
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,035
You won't be
seeing him no more.

246
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:59,351
This was in the garage.

247
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,065
Reuben, Reuben!

248
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,904
What are you doing?
You don't have any homework?

249
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,186
- No, I finished it.
- Are you sure?

250
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,459
What? No, but you should
do your homework,

251
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:36,901
otherwise you will end up
like, uh, the dumb...

252
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:40,695
- goyam in our neighborhood.
- I just told you, I finished it.

253
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,979
Well, then, go.
Go home and read.

254
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:44,941
Why do you force him
all the time?

255
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:55,690
Let's go. Let's go.

256
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,135
I don't-- I don't want to go.

257
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:34,004
We gotta go get
this person.

258
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,166
What the fuck
are you talking about?

259
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,522
Alla Shustervich.

260
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:42,360
She said she saw you.

261
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:45,006
She wants to see you.

262
00:32:47,606 --> 00:32:49,085
I didn't tell her
where you are.

263
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,519
I said we'd
pick her up.

264
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:55,195
What?

265
00:32:57,083 --> 00:33:00,357
- Where are we going?
- 3rd and Brighton.

266
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:19,070
- Get in. Hurry up.
- Where are we going?

267
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:22,272
- We're gonna see a movie.
- My mom thinks I'm coming back early.

268
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:23,788
- How old are you?
- 22.

269
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,071
- When was the last time you went out?
- I don't know.

270
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:27,951
Get in.

271
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,063
- Pick a movie.
- What movie?

272
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:35,702
Look in the paper.
Just make sure it's in the city.

273
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,029
Can I smoke in here?

274
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:45,946
It's Freddy.
He's here.

275
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,337
- I heard him.
- Freddy is dead,

276
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:51,340
buried and consecrated.
We won, remember?

277
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:54,418
- He's coming back for us.
- Kincaid's right.

278
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:56,623
Fred Krueger's history.

279
00:33:56,707 --> 00:34:00,300
- Come here.
- Joey!

280
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:04,217
- Thank God. I thought for a minute--
- What?

281
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,613
- Dragging us in here.
- Yeah, cut it out!

282
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:08,977
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.

283
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:11,417
The pipes are cold.

284
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:15,778
The boiler is cold.
See for yourself.

285
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,527
- Good night, Reuben.
- Good night.

286
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:27,370
Good night.

287
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,285
So why do you
wanna talk to me?

288
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,484
I don't know.

289
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,843
I didn't expect to go
to a movie and everything. I just...

290
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:01,079
wanted to talk some more,
you know?

291
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,278
It don't make
no difference to me.

292
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,756
Then what are you
doing here?

293
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:10,600
Did you kill
Boris Volkoff's son?

294
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:13,756
That's what you're here for now,
right, to shoot someone?

295
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:17,915
- That's why you left.
- I can go all over.

296
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,997
Except here.

297
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:26,517
You can't tell anybody
I'm here.

298
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,516
It's no big deal. Just don't go around
shooting your fucking mouth off.

299
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,033
I can't go back
to Brighton right now.

300
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:40,391
What else can I say,
you know?

301
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:49,144
How'd you know
about my father?

302
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,667
I wanted to see you.

303
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:56,189
- Make sure you were okay.
- No, I mean, how'd you know?

304
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,344
I don't wanna talk anymore.

305
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:07,301
Gonna give me
your number?

306
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:09,539
Can go out?

307
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,698
We'll go out this week.

308
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,142
You'll make a call.

309
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,419
Huh?

310
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,975
I don't know.

311
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:25,783
What?

312
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:31,294
I have my own phone.

313
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:33,497
Number's listed.

314
00:36:44,298 --> 00:36:46,176
Does that hurt?

315
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,723
You know
I can't afford it.

316
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:10,006
You just want
your dress.

317
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:13,927
Boris could help.
You know he'd help me.

318
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:15,647
He helps everybody.

319
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,005
And I would
never accept it.

320
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,921
- He could lend you the money.
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,716
You take something from him,

322
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:27,685
and then you keep taking.

323
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:30,154
You can never get away.

324
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,839
- You can.
- You can't.

325
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,153
It's too easy.
It's weak.

326
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:39,877
The weak are the killers
that come quietly.

327
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,953
And that's how they kill.
Like the tumor.

328
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,954
It's God punishing me.

329
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,910
I have to believe that,

330
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,957
because if I didn't,
I couldn't believe in anything.

331
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,156
You will always have your son.

332
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,708
My son.
I had two sons once.

333
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:03,630
I always tried to teach them.
I always tried to do my best.

334
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:06,911
I really played music--
I played Mozart for him

335
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,189
when we was
five months old.

336
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:12,185
Then, I bought him a piano.

337
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,582
I practiced with him.

338
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:17,469
I read bedtime stories...

339
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,192
every evening.

340
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:25,546
I was stupid, I guess.

341
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,177
You know, to read to a child
of two years old

342
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:32,466
"Crime and Punishment,"
I think that's stupid.

343
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:34,663
You just can't force them.

344
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,703
I never force anybody.

345
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:39,174
But you know,
there's a saying:

346
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:44,978
When a child is six years old,

347
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:50,175
he says the father can
do everything.

348
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:53,783
When he is 1 2 he says

349
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:56,170
the father can
almost do everything.

350
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:58,411
When he's 16,

351
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,888
he says the father's an idiot.

352
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:04,609
When he is 24,
he says,

353
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,169
father wasn't
maybe such an idiot.

354
00:39:09,258 --> 00:39:12,487
And then when he's 40,
he says,

355
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:15,171
if I only
could ask my father.

356
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:18,692
But I'm afraid

357
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:22,322
my sons will never
ask themselves that.

358
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:32,327
Are you worried
that I'm married?

359
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,324
It isn't the first thing
on my mind, believe me.

360
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:39,439
I mean,
does it bother you?

361
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,363
Does it bother you?

362
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:00,558
Don't you think
we should talk?

363
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:04,112
Speak English?

364
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,517
Is she a good fuck?

365
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,868
I think we should talk,
don't you?

366
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:22,192
I'm not gonna be
in Brooklyn long.

367
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:25,472
But I'm gonna see Ma before she dies,
whether you like it or not.

368
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,387
I'm gonna do it
with or without your help,

369
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,193
but I wanna
make a truce.

370
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:33,834
Truce, all right?

371
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:37,102
I don't wanna see Ma
with us fighting.

372
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:46,384
Your lady friend up there,
how long have you been doing her?

373
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:48,426
Before or after
Ma got sick?

374
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:53,019
I love your mother.

375
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:56,382
Yeah, does Reuben know
about her yet?

376
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,872
It's me, Ma.

377
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,735
Yoshi.

378
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:49,648
Now you promise me
you'll take care of your brother.

379
00:43:58,256 --> 00:44:00,326
Do you remember
when you were little,

380
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:03,531
you gave Papa
all your models--

381
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:05,252
your little plane models?

382
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,846
I don't remember.

383
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,443
Oh, you-- you said, "Papa,

384
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,647
I made all these
plane models for you."

385
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,681
But I know you can change.

386
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:38,118
You don't believe it,
but I know you can.

387
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:40,593
Mm-hmm, I guess so.

388
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:46,154
You go to Grandma's party
on Sunday, tomorrow.

389
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:49,350
I can't go.
You go for me.

390
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,716
- I'll go.
- She-- she won't say it,

391
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:55,235
but she would love
if you were to go.

392
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,751
I'll go, Ma.

393
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:18,064
I love you, Ma.

394
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,826
Lay down, Ma.

395
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:54,414
This is gonna be our hangout.

396
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:05,053
You know, every time I come here
the teachers rush us through.

397
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,609
Can't even enjoy it.

398
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:12,808
These guys don't look too happy
in there, though, do they?

399
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,407
You know what?

400
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:21,134
I haven't been to school
in like months.

401
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:26,043
- Why not?
- It's boring.

402
00:46:26,134 --> 00:46:28,090
I'd rather be smoking bud
in a museum.

403
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:33,162
Let's go see the snakes.

404
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:40,607
I'm fucked up.

405
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:59,197
Don't do that.

406
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:02,041
Don't do that.

407
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:05,354
Just scared it's gonna smash
through the glass or something,

408
00:47:05,443 --> 00:47:07,796
bite your head off.

409
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:10,476
If it could, it would.

410
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,357
It might.

411
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,590
Well, I ain't standing near it.

412
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,750
Are you gonna take
someone to the dump?

413
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:25,226
Make them disappear?

414
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:27,192
That's what Sasha
always says.

415
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:30,473
He says you guys take
schwartzes and shit to the dump.

416
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:35,033
Anyone who goes there
never comes back.

417
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:37,501
% Don don! %

418
00:47:40,993 --> 00:47:44,267
Sasha's a nobody. He should
shut his fuckin' mouth.

419
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:54,866
What's the matter?

420
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:57,746
Oh fuck,
I gotta puke.

421
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:00,215
Do it in the fucking corner.

422
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:10,258
Wow.

423
00:48:18,622 --> 00:48:22,978
What the frick is going--
how did you get in here?

424
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:25,015
What is--

425
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:26,896
What are you guys doing here?

426
00:48:26,979 --> 00:48:28,537
Whoa! Whoa!

427
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,894
You all right?

428
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:34,730
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

429
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:36,693
Get the fuck up.

430
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:49,364
- Wrong door.
- Yeah.

431
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:56,047
When are you gonna leave?

432
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,361
Get some sleep.

433
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,684
You want some?

434
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:06,999
Got the munchies.

435
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:10,240
So where you gonna go?

436
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,839
We're Jews, we wander.

437
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,520
Didn't they teach you
that shit in Hebrew school?

438
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:19,115
Maybe back to Russia.

439
00:49:21,964 --> 00:49:24,351
Are you gonna stay
until after Ma dies?

440
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:27,515
Don't say that.
She could still pull through.

441
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:29,319
Okay.

442
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,915
So don't say that.

443
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:36,552
I hear her crying
all the time.

444
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,313
You've been very strong.

445
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,354
You don't always
have to be that way.

446
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,188
You can feel sad
about it.

447
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:46,875
I'll try and stay
a little longer.

448
00:49:49,037 --> 00:49:51,151
Are you going
to Grandma's party on Sunday?

449
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:53,510
We'll see.

450
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,549
- Josh?
- Yeah?

451
00:49:57,233 --> 00:49:58,792
I love you.

452
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:04,983
Good night.

453
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:07,538
Feel better
and go to school.

454
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:11,467
What are we gonna do
about his wife?

455
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,704
If you think she'll say shit
after we get through with him,

456
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:16,505
you're out
of your fucking mind.

457
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:20,945
She's no problem. If she is,
someone will visit her too.

458
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:22,823
Does that backroom have alarms?

459
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:24,658
There's no alarm.

460
00:50:24,746 --> 00:50:26,735
I got a key.

461
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,976
It's probably the least protected place
in the whole fucking city.

462
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:32,702
We'll bring him to the dump.
We'll do it there.

463
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:36,662
We'll burn the body.
If there's no body, there's no crime.

464
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:40,974
We'll drop the gun there.
They can't pin it on anybody.

465
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,696
All right, Sunday's the night.

466
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:49,894
- Hello?
- It's Joshua.

467
00:50:49,978 --> 00:50:52,334
- Wanna get something to eat?
- lsn't it late.

468
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:55,614
I'll come by and pick you up.
We'll go to the diner near you.

469
00:50:55,697 --> 00:50:57,369
The one on Utica.

470
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:59,764
I better go.

471
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:02,609
How long you worked
at a candy store?

472
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,412
Three years.

473
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,849
- Looks pretty boring.
- It's okay.

474
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:08,763
I help old ladies
pick out candy.

475
00:51:08,852 --> 00:51:11,321
I had to do something,
so that's what I'm doing.

476
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:13,324
It could be worse.

477
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,965
Some people have
to do really bad shit.

478
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,962
I remember once my mother
told me and my brother

479
00:51:19,051 --> 00:51:20,960
she had to fuck a guard
to get out of Russia.

480
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:28,283
- You wanna go?
- I'm taking the subway.

481
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:31,244
- You'll get killed on the subway.
- I'll go on the subway.

482
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:33,965
You like that?

483
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:37,958
I hate it.

484
00:51:41,523 --> 00:51:43,082
You want a ride?

485
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:46,920
No.

486
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:29,563
You asleep?

487
00:53:34,932 --> 00:53:37,285
Did everybody
talk about me?

488
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,560
While I was gone, I mean.

489
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:46,117
Yeah.

490
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,005
What did they say?

491
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:54,924
I don't know. They just wanted
to know what you were doing.

492
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:59,515
Did you think of me?

493
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,675
Not really.

494
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:05,113
Sometimes.

495
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:10,074
I wondered where you went.

496
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,351
Why are you so tired?

497
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,794
I don't know, maybe it's because
you don't let me sleep.

498
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:28,428
Are you gonna go out
and see your brother?

499
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:31,109
He's nice.

500
00:54:31,195 --> 00:54:33,585
- He's smart.
- Hmm.

501
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:35,232
Smart kid.

502
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,869
- An American.
- Hmm.

503
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:40,749
- Think I'm dumb?
- Hmm?

504
00:54:42,272 --> 00:54:45,308
- You think I'm dumb?
- No.

505
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:49,222
I'm not smart, though,

506
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:51,777
Iike all the professors
in the organizazia.

507
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,586
My family is smart, though,
in Russia.

508
00:54:57,668 --> 00:54:59,898
Aunt lrene, Uncle Alec,

509
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:02,136
my parents, my grandparents--

510
00:55:03,186 --> 00:55:05,223
everybody's smart.

511
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:13,581
You up?

512
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:51,164
I just wanted to tell you guys,
if something goes wrong

513
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:53,209
you don't panic.

514
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:54,883
You tell me.

515
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:57,725
Or if you can,
we just go on as planned.

516
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,289
You forget about it.

517
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,440
Okay?

518
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,444
You know where
you're going?

519
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,233
We are here

520
00:56:50,317 --> 00:56:52,875
to celebrate

521
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,071
the 80th birthday

522
00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:58,547
of my mama.

523
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:06,147
Tsilya Sokolova.

524
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:07,824
80 years.

525
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,857
To our mama.

526
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:31,856
To our mama.

527
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:57,652
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Not now.

528
00:57:57,737 --> 00:58:00,012
Sorry.

529
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,725
Thank you, Mr. Volkoff.

530
00:58:09,814 --> 00:58:11,484
You have been
very generous.

531
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:14,645
I've treated you
with respect.

532
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:19,599
Which I would not do
for someone else in your situation.

533
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:22,605
And I'm grateful.

534
00:58:22,689 --> 00:58:26,478
I've asked for only one thing
in return from you.

535
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:29,996
I've spared your family.

536
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:35,643
But I've heard rumors about
that mongrel of a son of yours.

537
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:39,519
Do you have anything
to tell me?

538
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:45,237
I will hold you responsible

539
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:48,355
if he's here.

540
00:58:51,122 --> 00:58:53,078
Do you understand me?

541
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,720
You would know.

542
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,109
I know what it is
to lose a son.

543
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:04,392
All right.

544
00:59:06,998 --> 00:59:08,954
I trust you.

545
01:02:41,776 --> 01:02:44,210
Put him down.

546
01:02:54,653 --> 01:02:57,085
Do you believe in God?

547
01:02:58,451 --> 01:03:00,886
Wait 10 seconds,
see if God saves you.

548
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:27,278
Get the tongue.

549
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:34,709
Bring the body.

550
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:49,155
Oh fuck.

551
01:04:26,188 --> 01:04:28,654
Drop the gun.
Wipe it down.

552
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:09,974
Can't remember the rest of it.
I guess...

553
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:12,527
that's enough for now.

554
01:07:18,298 --> 01:07:21,288
- What's that?
- The Mourner's Kaddish.

555
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:23,811
Come here every week,
It's the place my father died.

556
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:28,763
Let's go.

557
01:07:32,973 --> 01:07:36,569
- Going away?
- Yeah.

558
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:39,086
I thought we were going
to do some things.

559
01:07:39,172 --> 01:07:41,845
I guess I'll just be
sorta hanging around after you leave.

560
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:46,443
Guess this is it.

561
01:07:46,531 --> 01:07:48,963
Got no choice.

562
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:53,525
Sorry, I can't make it tonight.

563
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:57,802
Please don't ask.

564
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:13,037
Shh, shh.

565
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,906
Are you going through
my mail again?

566
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:28,593
I found some of my letters

567
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:31,271
in one of your drawers.

568
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,269
I know you haven't been in school
for two months.

569
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:38,031
Don't run away.
I want to talk to you.

570
01:08:38,116 --> 01:08:40,582
Reuben, I want to talk to you!

571
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,064
Can I talk to you?

572
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,270
I want to talk to you.

573
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:51,661
Open the door.
Open the door!

574
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:55,539
All right.
Don't want to open the door.

575
01:09:18,703 --> 01:09:21,457
I'm sorry I hit you.

576
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:23,976
But you're always running away.

577
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:29,608
I don't want you
to see Joshua anymore.

578
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,773
Joshua's not your brother anymore.
Understand?

579
01:09:34,339 --> 01:09:38,694
I've spent my life trying to make
things better for you.

580
01:09:38,777 --> 01:09:41,815
I don't make apologies.

581
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:44,364
If I make mistakes,
I'm sorry.

582
01:09:46,576 --> 01:09:50,362
You think I like working
at the stand?

583
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:53,253
Do you think I enjoy
selling gifts

584
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:56,006
and magazines?

585
01:09:56,093 --> 01:09:58,561
It's only because of you.

586
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:02,206
To make money for you.

587
01:10:03,692 --> 01:10:07,080
Your brother is a different story.

588
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,445
He's a street rat.

589
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:13,078
You may think you know all about him,
but believe me you don't.

590
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:15,635
He has no ambition.

591
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:18,287
No desire, no nothing.

592
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:22,673
I know you don't respect me,

593
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:25,200
but Lord knows I tried my best.

594
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:29,432
Reuben...

595
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:34,957
Does your girlfriend respect you?

596
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,377
Came to say bye.

597
01:11:23,589 --> 01:11:26,021
Pop did that to you?

598
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:50,370
- We're going for a ride.
- What's this?

599
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,894
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey.

600
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,448
We're going for a ride.

601
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,372
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's my son.

602
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,719
Stop.

603
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:48,433
Turn around.

604
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,389
Take off your coat.

605
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:20,947
Take off your pants.

606
01:13:42,748 --> 01:13:45,217
Kneel down.

607
01:14:04,462 --> 01:14:08,613
Aren't you gonna say anything?

608
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:14,775
You're a big man. Is that it?
You're a big man?

609
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:17,328
I don't need a gun
to be a man.

610
01:14:27,857 --> 01:14:30,688
I don't know...

611
01:14:30,775 --> 01:14:33,243
what made you what you are.

612
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:37,651
All I ask you
is to leave Reuben alone.

613
01:14:40,132 --> 01:14:42,487
Please.

614
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:46,528
Even you must know
there's nowhere

615
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:49,045
you can go anymore.

616
01:14:51,129 --> 01:14:53,006
You have destroyed us.

617
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,319
You have destroyed our family.

618
01:14:59,568 --> 01:15:03,036
Joshua? Joshua?

619
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:20,995
Hey, Mom.

620
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:23,548
Hey.

621
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,074
Water?

622
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:04,022
Mom? Mom?

623
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,861
Mom, are you okay?
Mom? Mom?

624
01:16:06,948 --> 01:16:09,143
Mom!

625
01:18:06,953 --> 01:18:09,422
Hey, Josh.
Can I talk to you a sec?

626
01:18:15,312 --> 01:18:18,700
I know you're gonna leave and all,
but there's something I gotta tell you.

627
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:24,257
It's your mom.

628
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:30,496
She's dead.

629
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:20,057
- Hey, Sasha.
- She did it, she left a kid in the car.

630
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,256
- Hey, have you seen Josh?
- She left the fucking baby--

631
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,885
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Somebody just stopped me on my bike.

632
01:21:28,936 --> 01:21:31,688
If Josh is still here,
you gotta tell me.

633
01:21:33,175 --> 01:21:34,733
Come on, man.

634
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,642
He's at Alla's house, all right?
It's on 4th and Newkirk, I think.

635
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:43,530
- Which house? Which address?
- I don't know which house.

636
01:21:45,132 --> 01:21:47,564
You'll never find which house!

637
01:29:03,688 --> 01:29:06,405
Ma?

638
01:29:06,486 --> 01:29:09,637
Josh is home.

639
01:29:17,723 --> 01:29:21,921
Love you, Ma.

640
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,348
Ma, Josh is home.
