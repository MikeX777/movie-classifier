1
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,999
Not bad, Maria.

2
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,599
F?r the next time l w?uld like you
to w?rk ?n the intonati?n.

3
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,679
lt's imp?rtant to keep watching how
the bow is sliding ?n the strings.

4
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,279
When you practice, try to accent
the notes as much as you can.

5
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,799
-See you next week.
-Yes, say hi to J?hanna for me.

6
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,839
DARK SOULS

7
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,319
N?, Judith,
you're d?ing it completly wrong.

8
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,359
Yes, you have to put the. . .

9
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,999
Y?u have to put
the cartridge in the printer first.

10
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,839
?hen you must press the little
green button, not the red ?ne.

11
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,519
?he green ?ne,
located just below "power ?n".

12
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
?hat's right.

13
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,719
Yes.

14
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,119
Ok, n?w you sh?uld hear
a rumbling n?ise.

15
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
Yes, it means that it's w?rking.

16
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,719
Yes. . .
Are you ready?

17
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,959
Are you taking notes?

18
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,759
Good .

19
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,319
Female, in her 20's. . .

20
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,199
Maybe younger.

21
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,519
Yes, that's n?rmal,
it's just the printer warming up.

22
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,719
?he skull looks smashed .

23
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,959
F?und an h?ur ag? by. . .
Wait a second .

24
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,599
Kristine.

25
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,159
-What's the name of the witness?
-Maia Stokke.

26
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,039
Maia Stokke.

27
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,759
D?n't touch anything
before the forensics get here.

28
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,319
N?, we can't, it's imp?ssible
to drive a car up here.

29
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,359
Ask Lars to pick us up
near Vettak?llen.

30
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,919
We will have to perform an autopsy
and inform the family. . .

31
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,439
l'll take care of that.

32
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,559
?i, sweetheart,
did you have a good day?

33
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,879
l h?pe you're hungry.

34
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,519
This is lieutenant Askestad
from the Oslo Crime Squad.

35
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,639
-May I speak with Morten Ravn?
-Yes, it's me.

36
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,599
Good evening, Mr. Ravn.
I have bad news, unfortunately.

37
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,759
S?mething happened?

38
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,239
We found your daughter dead
in the forest this afternoon.

39
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,639
Could you come
and identify her body...

40
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,959
lt's imp?ssible, l just said hell?
to her. She just came h?me.

41
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,919
-Are you sure?
-Yes of course l'm sure!

42
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,399
Wait a second, d?n't hang up.

43
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,999
J?hanna. . .

44
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,239
lt's the p?lice ?n the ph?ne.

45
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,479
?hey found your dead corpse
in the forest!

46
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,639
What sh?uld l tell them?

47
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,999
Y?u must be mistaken,
my daughter is right in front of me.

48
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,959
-Must be an error in the register.
-Yes, check your register.

49
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,959
Sorry...

50
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,319
Goodbye.

51
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,319
J?hanna. . .

52
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,039
Did you fall in the mud
while jogging, ?r what?

53
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,439
?here's food for you in the kitchen,
if you're hungry.

54
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,719
J?hanna?. . .

55
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,879
Are you still ?n the lnternet?

56
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,799
?ELP ME

57
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,239
She's lying here,
in the li?ing room . . .

58
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,559
-l'll turn ?n the light. . .
-What happened?

59
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,919
She came h?me after running. . .
Sat there with?ut saying a w?rd . . .

60
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,799
She jumped at me and started
to ?omit this black substance. . .

61
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,879
-?as she said anything?
-N?. . .

62
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,119
She's breathing,
but l can't find her pulse. . .

63
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,839
But l have something ?n the scope. . .

64
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,679
We're taking her to the h?spital.

65
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,439
Y?u'll be sitting in the front, sir.

66
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,559
-Please?
-Same for me. . .

67
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,199
-We're g?ing to my place. . .
-Y?ur place?

68
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,199
-Where is it?
-Over there, it's not that far.

69
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,719
l have to piss.

70
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,239
?ell??

71
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,359
Y?u fucking prick,
are you watching me piss ?r what!

72
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,039
Seri?usly!

73
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,479
Assh?le! What the fuck. . .

74
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,799
lt doesn't seem right. . .

75
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,879
?rue. Look at this.

76
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,479
Yes, that's her. . .

77
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,359
l d?n't get it.

78
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,119
She's suffering from
some kind of disorientati?n.

79
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,759
?eadaches foll?wed by v?miting,
neurological disorder -

80
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,719
- and epileptic seizures.
-She was dead . . .

81
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,759
l saw it myself.

82
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,479
?he scanner reveals the presence
of a pathogenic ?rganism -

83
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,079
- probably injected
after the perforati?n of the skull.

84
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,439
Metastasis are rapidly devel?ping, -

85
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,759
- damaging
the frontal and temp?ral l?bes.

86
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,119
-Metastasis?
-Mitoses.

87
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,839
Cell degenerati?n.

88
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,759
Cancer!

89
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,959
When?

90
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,559
Ok, l'm ?n my way.

91
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,319
?hanks. Bye.

92
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,159
-D? you think she'll recover?
-N?, l d?ubt it.

93
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,479
?he ?nly certain thing is that
her attacker knows what he's d?ing.

94
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,359
T? drill the skull the way he did
with?ut damaging the brain is a feat.

95
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,999
?ere.
Call me if there's anything new.

96
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,399
Wait!

97
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,519
Y?u're Askestad, right?
We talked ?n the ph?ne last night.

98
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,799
Oh yes, Ra?n.
S?rry ab?ut your daughter.

99
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,999
?his is crazy, isn't it?

100
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,359
Sure. . .
l've never seen anything like this. . .

101
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,559
-But l'm in a hurry, l have to g?.
-But what ab?ut J?hanna?

102
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,759
Y?u're g?ing
to find the attacker, right?

103
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,639
?he assh?le that took away my. . .

104
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,959
Y?u can count ?n us, Ra?n.

105
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,679
Mr. Ra?n. . .

106
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,199
?he results are not good .

107
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,359
Y?ur daughter is very sick.

108
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,959
She has a tum?r
in the central nerv?us system . . .

109
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,279
? tum?r?!

110
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,919
l d?n't understand . . .

111
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,599
? cerebral bi?psy is needed .
We ha?e to rem?ve it.

112
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,879
lt's growing and spreading quickly.

113
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,879
lt's a high risk ?perati?n. . .
l need your permissi?n.

114
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,839
Y?ur daughter has a very small
chance to survive this ?perati?n.

115
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
But if we d?n't d? something quick,
her conditi?n might deteri?rate. . .

116
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,799
Dr. ?ansen!

117
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,759
Come quick, there's a problem
with ?ne of your patients!

118
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,439
J?hanna?!

119
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,319
-She w?ke up and jumped ?n me!
-Must be a reacti?n to the medicine.

120
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,559
Well, that's imp?ssible,
l didn't give her anything yet!

121
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,559
What have you d?ne to her?

122
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,919
What the hell have you d?ne to her!

123
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,959
?he corpse arrived very late
and Peter didn't notice that. . .

124
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,479
?hat the girl was still alive?

125
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,919
-Peter is new here, it was late. . .
-l understand . . .

126
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,159
Y?u were tired .

127
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,959
S? you didn't notice that the girl
you put in the fridge was alive.

128
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,399
Y?u didn't even notice when she
wandered ?ut into the corrid?rs.

129
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,359
l understand, you were tired .
Overw?rked .

130
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,079
?hese corpses just arrived .
N? ?ne has touched them yet.

131
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,359
Are you sure
that they are dead this time?

132
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,359
?ave you checked?

133
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,919
?hese are exactly the same w?unds
as the other young w?man.

134
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,159
?he male body has the skull
crushed several places.

135
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,599
?e's unrecognizable.

136
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,159
Autopsy?

137
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,079
N?, like l said
the bodies just arrived .

138
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,639
lf she struggled, there may be traces
of the attacker under her fingernails

139
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,599
Tweezers?

140
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,119
Hi, lieutenant,
it's neurosurgeon Hansen calling.

141
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,599
l'm quite busy right now, so. . .

142
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,519
I must inform you, something
happened just after you left...

143
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,759
J?hanna went into hysteria
while her father was in the room .

144
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,479
N?w he refuses to give
permissi?n for the girl's ?perati?n.

145
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,999
He wants to bring her back home.
lt's ridiculous.

146
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,359
But why did you call me?

147
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,639
Well, you could con?ince him
to lea?e her here in ?bservati?n.

148
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,719
We could perform m?re tests,
find ?ut what she's suffering from . . .

149
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,559
lt could tell us
something about the attacker...

150
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,959
Well, it's his daughter,
we can't force him to. . .

151
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,119
?ell??

152
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,519
Askestad?

153
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,439
30 days later

154
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,599
. . .we've never seen
anything like this.

155
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,439
You'd have to be
experienced in surgery -

156
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,239
- to accomplish such horrors.

157
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,599
The inability of the police to
solve the case is also outrageous.

158
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,839
It's a disgrace, and it is obvious
that we need help from abroad.

159
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,119
How many have to die
before the police understand -

160
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,439
- the seriousness of the situation.

161
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,999
Chief commissioner, it's under-
standable that people are scared -

162
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,159
- when you apparently
have no leads whatsoever. . .

163
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,159
We need to relax a bit here,
you're exaggerating a lot.

164
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,239
You're making heavy accusations.
We're doing the best we...

165
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,039
It's the biggest serial killer case
we've had in hundreds of years.

166
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,599
It can be compared
to Jack The Ripper.

167
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,279
And you are telling us
how efficient you are...

168
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,359
You're exaggerating again.

169
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,079
-These are not homicides. . .
-Not homicides?! lt's even worse!

170
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,759
Innocent people are drilled
in the head and are left to rot, -

171
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,999
- and they practically live as
vegetables, rotten vegetables!

172
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,159
They are left in a state
comparable to -

173
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,119
- how the police
are handling the case:

174
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,999
Completly vegetative!

175
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,759
How many victims
are we talking about now?

176
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,199
Well. . . the exact number
of offences is around. . .

177
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
"Offences"?!

178
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,639
?he total is n?w well ?ver -

179
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,039
- 30 ?ictims. . .

180
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,719
lt must stop.

181
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,719
?he chief commissi?ner
is ?n my back, he wants results.

182
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,159
?he press is all ?ver it,
making exaggerati?ns.

183
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,439
S? tell me, what's new ab?ut -

184
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,759
- this "Toolbox murder"?

185
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,479
Eckhoff, the hardware sh?p lead,
is it g?ing anywhere?

186
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,959
Can l have the pictures, please. . .

187
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,959
We are n?w certain that the killer
uses this particular drill model.

188
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,359
An all-in-one drill.

189
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,599
? comm?n tool,
easy to get h?ld of -

190
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,079
- at any hardware sh?p in town.

191
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,599
We also have a suspect. . .

192
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,359
Kjetil Ulteig.

193
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,519
? soci?path, well kn?wn -

194
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,799
- to the psychiatric services
of Osl?.

195
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,519
And he also w?rks
at a hardware store, -

196
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,799
- and has recently been fired .

197
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,439
D? you have
anything better to say, Askestad?

198
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,599
l'll let you know
if l think of anything.

199
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,599
3 days before. . .

200
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,519
?hese patients are stable,
they are completly impassive.

201
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,719
?he agressive ?nes are ?n the floor
ab?ve. ?hey're in padded cells.

202
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,839
Look. . .
?his sample was sent to the lab.

203
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,719
?his liquid is comp?sed of
n?n-oxidized chains of carb?n.

204
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,919
Organic chemistry.
Crude ?ils. Petrol.

205
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,199
?his substance has been taken from
the body of ?ne of the ?ictims.

206
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,359
Actually, it's ev?l?ing inside every
single ?ictim of the attacker.

207
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,679
-Y?u're kidding. . .
-Not at all.

208
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,959
And its m?lecular formula is some
kind of unkn?wn hydrocarb?n.

209
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,639
-Where the hell does it come from?
-Good questi?n. . .

210
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,359
Psych?path still running free

211
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,559
Wanted madman
might be in Sweden

212
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,359
Good afternoon. This is the news.

213
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,439
A young man has been attacked
at his home in Grefsen.

214
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,919
He was severly wounded,
and is now hospitalised.

215
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,199
The police stated that this might
be the work of the same attacker.

216
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,399
At 7 pm last night
the victim's mother came home -

217
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,519
- and found
her son severly injured.

218
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,679
Her son seems to be
victim number 37 -

219
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,959
- in a series of identical attacks
in the last weeks.

220
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,039
Again a person in orange jump suit
was seen fleeing the crime scene.

221
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,039
Apart from that, the police once
again have few leads to follow.

222
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,199
?ry to get some sleep, J?hanna.

223
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,159
Good night, sweetie.

224
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,079
-Good evening, Maria.
-?i.

225
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,399
lt's been weeks since we
last saw you at school. . .

226
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,999
l've had some other things
?n my mind .

227
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,759
l d?n't have time to teach anym?re.

228
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,399
lt's understandable, with all
that's happened and everything. . .

229
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,799
Actually, l came to see
how J?hanna is d?ing.

230
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,959
Can l come in?

231
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,839
Yes. . . J?hanna is very sick.

232
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,959
W?uldn't she be better off
in a h?spital?

233
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,639
Oh n?, n?. We are fine here,
the tw? of us.

234
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,599
She's getting better and better.

235
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,119
lt's ?nly a matter of time.

236
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,679
But you came to see your friend . . .
Wait here a second, l'll g? get her.

237
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,239
l can come back some other time
if she's sleeping. . .

238
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,599
N?, it's fine.

239
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,999
Besides. . .

240
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,839
She doesn't sleep anym?re.

241
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,639
Look wh?'s here, sweetheart!

242
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,279
lt's your friend Maria!

243
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,719
Y?u remember her, right?

244
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,559
D?n't be scared, Maria. . .
She's getting better, you kn?w.

245
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,359
Look.
She can stand alm?st by herself.

246
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,759
Good, that's my girl. . .

247
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,959
Now you understand why
l've put up the plastic sheets.

248
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,919
Yes?
What d? yo want?

249
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,759
What are you d?ing?!

250
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,359
J?hanna, it was him, right?!

251
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,399
We got him, J?hanna.

252
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,919
N?, it's too dangerous. . .

253
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,279
Fuck it.

254
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,159
l'll be back soon.

255
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,799
Come ?n.

256
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,559
Over here.

257
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,359
S?, what's it g?nna be
for you tonight?

258
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,319
Y?u've had a l?ng day. . .

259
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,279
? l?ng day?

260
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,719
D?n't you want
to take off your mask?

261
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,119
D?n't. . .

262
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,439
S?, Mr. Ra?n. . .

263
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,199
What were you d?ing there exactly?

264
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,479
l've already told you,
l foll?wed my daughter's attacker.

265
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,839
One m?re time, from the beginning.

266
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,679
l parked my car near the ?ydro+
factory in the industrial area.

267
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,439
l was just looking around . . .

268
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,799
And then a w?rker appeared
and attacked us with a drill!

269
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,719
l got ?ut of it, but. . .

270
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:01,839
But instead of lea?ing,
l decided to ?bserve him .

271
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,679
?e left the factory in a Jeep.

272
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,599
-And you foll?wed him?
-Yes.

273
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,559
l foll?wed him
to some kind of motel. . .

274
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,199
l went up the stairs,
hid in a room and . . .

275
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,079
And l saw everything.

276
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,239
Listen to me! l've seen
what they d? to their ?ictims!

277
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,039
Wait. . . Y?u said "thet".

278
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,239
Yes there was an ?ld man
wearing an ?ld-fashi?ned suit. . .

279
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,879
?e was together with the attacker.

280
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,079
?hey had some kind of machine
that sucked ?ut the liquid from . . .

281
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:57,239
And then they injected
a dark substance. . .

282
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,559
?he same that my daughter. . .

283
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,879
?ere, l took pictures.

284
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,279
Proof of everything l've told you .

285
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,039
Y?u sh?uld ha?e contacted us first.

286
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,799
Come ?n, l' m gi?ing you
evidence ?n a silver platter!

287
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,359
l even marked the p?siti?n
of the factory ?n that map!

288
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,039
Well, good j?b,
inspector M?rten Ra?n.

289
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,879
S? what d? l d? n?w?

290
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,439
Sh?uld l put
all the w?rkers under arrest?

291
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,239
Listen to me n?w.
l'll let you g?.

292
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,719
But you can't leave Osl?.

293
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,359
And stop your stupid quest
for revenge. Let us d? ?ur w?rk.

294
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,199
But l've just found him!
And l know where he's hiding!

295
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,759
l understand what you're
g?ing through. Y?u can g? now.

296
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,919
Farewell.

297
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,119
?i, Maria. . . lt's M?rten Ra?n.

298
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,999
N?, not very well.
Could you d? me a fav?ur?

299
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,359
Excuse me. . .

300
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,559
D? you know another way
into the factory?

301
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,559
Why are you so interested
in that factory?

302
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,799
Are you a spy? P?lice?

303
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:20,639
My daughter was attacked,
l think the culprit is in there.

304
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,159
l want to find ?ut.

305
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,799
Attacked . . . She doesn't look
so good then, l guess.

306
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,559
l w?uldn't hang around here -

307
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,319
- if l were you,
they're g?nna find you .

308
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,959
Ok, l'll figure it ?ut, thanks.

309
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,159
Wait a second!

310
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,799
l've been unempl?yed

311
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,159
- so a little help
w?uld be appreciated .

312
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,359
?hat's all l've got. . .

313
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,439
S?rry.

314
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,959
-Th?se binoculars look quite nice.
-Ok, that's en?ugh n?w.

315
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,759
S?, tell me what you kn?w,

Yes, a bastard like you say!

317
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,599
l've l?st everything! My wife,
my h?me, my health, everything!

318
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:40,079
-Yeah sorry, l didn't mean it. . .
-Thanks to me this country is rich!

319
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,639
Me and some other di?ers. . .

320
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,079
lf it hadn't been for us, you
w?uldn't be sitting in your ?illas -

321
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:52,159
- drinking B?rdeaux, complaining
ab?ut your 6 h?ur w?rk day!

322
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,279
S?. . . you're a diver?

323
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,839
Yes.

324
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,359
l w?rked for ?ydro+. . .
?hank God l'm d?ne with it.

325
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,999
We were pi?neers, you know.
Day after day, 1 00, 200, 300 m . . .

326
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:30,559
Di?ing, drilling, mending,
in the cold and dark sea. . .

327
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,199
l l?st a lot of friends there.
Accidents because of the pressure.

328
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,679
All we got was a pat ?n the back,
and off we went again!

329
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,079
Oil had to fl?w,
n? matter what the cost.

330
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,959
l ended up w?unded
and they fired me.

331
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,159
l tried to w?rk as a carpenter,
but it was imp?ssible!

332
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,639
l kept ?n ha?ing dizzy spells.

333
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,399
Since then l've been
a poor bastard, that's true.

334
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,239
And every night l drown, -

335
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,519
- again and again.

336
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,639
But what are you d?ing here?
D?n't you have somewhere to g??

337
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,479
S? curi?us, so curi?us!

338
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,599
l'm sorry ab?ut your daughter, -

339
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,559
- you seem alright,
so l'm g?ing to help you ?ut.

340
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,559
At that time l had a friend,
a french di?er called Jean.

341
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,079
?e came here for the m?ney,
to become rich.

342
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:49,439
S? he w?rked all the time,
m?re m?ney, m?re m?ney!

343
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,199
But ?ne day, what sh?uldn't
have happened, happened .

344
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,359
At 300 m depth,
something went wrong.

345
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,559
?e went berserk, and panicked .

346
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,159
?e went up, with?ut any safety stop.

347
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,799
?e cut the safety line, sending all
his colleagues deep to their deaths.

348
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,159
l paid him a ?isit at the h?spital,
and l have to tell you . . .

349
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:27,279
?e was not the same guy l knew,
my ?ld friend Jean.

350
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:33,759
?e looked completly empty,
and his face seemed eaten by. . .

351
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,599
l d?n't kn?w what. . .

352
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,639
?e ?omited
some disgusting black mess.

353
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,839
And he kept repeating: l've seen
the Darkness, it's inside me!

354
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,439
l never heard ab?ut him after that, -

355
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,639
- and even th?ugh
he was my friend . . .

356
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,239
l was relieved!

357
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,839
En?ugh ab?ut that!
Where does that lea?e me?

358
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,199
With brain damage and ?n welfare.

359
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,559
But l'd rather be a poor bastard
than end up like Jean.

360
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,119
But that day. . .

361
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,919
S?mething came up
from the abyss. . .

362
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,879
l d?n't kn?w what it was.

363
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,759
But it was not ?il.

364
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,679
l d?n't want to kn?w!

365
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,879
N? ?ne must kn?w!

366
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:46,759
J?hanna?

367
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,919
lt burns. . .

368
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,159
My God . .!

369
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,919
J?hanna!

370
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,039
?he patient in bed 3
keeps ?n throwing up.

371
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,919
Start the projector, -

372
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,679
- so l can synchronise my speech
with the pictures.

373
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,439

374
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,199
-Wendy!

380
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,279
Must be the pictures.

381
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,399
l'm g?ing to check ?ut
this factory after all.

382
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,079
Our dear "inspector Ra?n"
might be right.

383
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,719
Sh?uld l call Eckhoff?

384
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,839
Excuse me? Eckhoff?

385
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,039
After 200 m,
turn left in the roundabout.

386
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,119
Second exit,
then stay on the left lane.
