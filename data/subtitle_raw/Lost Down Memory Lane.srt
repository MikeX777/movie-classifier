1
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,161
Can't you open your yap?
Have a cozy chat or something?

2
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,926
You start then.

3
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,171
I am, aren't I? But you sneak off.

4
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,649
<i>My Sarie Marais
is so far from my heart.</i>

5
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,691
<i>But I hope to see her again.</i>

6
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,528
<i>There under all the corn
near the green tree with thorns...</i>

7
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,923
<i>...there lives my Sarie Marais.</i>

8
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,210
Why I can only think of Sarie Marais
I have no idea.

9
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,282
<i>There where my Sarie lives.</i>

10
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,923
<i>There under all the corn
near the green tree with thorns...</i>

11
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,721
<i>...that's where my Sarie lives.</i>

12
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,402
Don't you know another song?
- I'm thinking.

13
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,689
<i>At my dovecote I love to be.</i>

14
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,401
<i>Being there is a pleasure to me.</i>

15
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,690
<i>You can still know everything there.</i>

16
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,890
<i>You won't have forgotten anything,
I swear.</i>

17
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,726
<i>At my dovecote I love to be.</i>

18
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,726
<i>Being there is a pleasure to me.</i>

19
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,328
<i>At my dovecote.</i>

20
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,722
It's been so long since I sang
that I can't remember anything.

21
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,485
I've got nothing here anyway.

22
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,290
All music is gone.

23
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,241
Are you confused?
- I'm completely confused.

24
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,643
I've done a lot of singing,
but I can't remember anything anymore.

25
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,643
And I didn't bring anything.

26
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,689
It's already a quarter to twelve.
- It will get even later.

27
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,328
Once I drove too far in the car.

28
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,082
I had too...
I don't remember where I was going...

29
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,928
...but I drove on
where I should have stopped...

30
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,686
...or turned around or turned off.

31
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,082
And that story.. I drove back
and got home all right...

32
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,926
...but I told that story
Perhaps that was stupid.

33
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,323
After that they said:
You should be locked up.

34
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,122
They didn't use those words, but that's
what they meant. I forgot too much.

35
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,961
I used to have a good memory
but not anymore.

36
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,162
It fades.

37
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,969
Why is that? Because of getting older.

38
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,765
There are enough of you, or should I help?
- Help! Look what's still there.

39
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,689
I don't have a cutting board.

40
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,041
There's no cutting board in the factory
either Use your hands.

41
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,089
We're not at the factory are we?

42
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,086
No, but I'm saying they don't use
a cutting board at Van de Poel's.

43
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,244
That's their business.

44
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,088
My goodness,
that's enough to make me sick.

45
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,084
You shouldn't.
- It doesn't bother me.

46
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,564
It shouldn't make you sick.
- I already am, I guess.

47
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,649
Yes, apparently.

48
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,323
Is it all right? God, you're not
wearing your hearing aid again.

49
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,801
I don't hear what you're saying.
- You're not wearing your hearing aid.

50
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,369
Your hearing aid.

51
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,165
Where is it?

52
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,445
There's no battery in it.
It ran out.

53
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,607
O, the battery ran out.

54
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,281
The battery ran out, honey

55
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,762
I don't feel I'm as mad as a hatter,
but I do forget things.

56
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,651
I have what's called Alzheimer's.

57
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,682
I don't mind admitting it.
It's clear

58
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,682
I'm not pathetic. Normally speaking
I'm a normal human being.

59
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,526
But I forget everything
and that's a real nuisance.

60
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,848
That's about the only thing I can say

61
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,641
I don't feel sick.
I don't feel unhappy.

62
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,484
Nothing like that.

63
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,769
I live as I used to,
except that I forget everything.

64
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,243
It's a phenomenon
that other people have as well.

65
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,926
I don't mind talking about it.

66
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,727
Hordes of people have it
and now I have it.

67
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,967
How you get it? You just do.
I don't know if it's related to anything.

68
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,091
I don't know.
I should ask a doctor.

69
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,848
I think it just appears.
It's in your brain.

70
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,287
It suddenly appears in there.

71
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,963
What a lovely Christmas tree.
- Yes, come and have a look, Edwine.

72
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,605
It's like a walking Christmastree.
We'll put it beside the cabinet again.

73
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,808
Here's the plug.
- Mariëtte has the plug.

74
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,931
Here's another one.
- Isn't that a light?

75
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,247
What do you think?
Does it look OK?

76
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,283
Let's look at it from a distance.

77
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,681
Alice, what do you think?
- It looks good.

78
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,047
Are they spaced out evenly?
- It looks good.

79
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,162
You need some here.

80
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,247
Hang on. We're working on it.
- I'm just saying.

81
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,523
All those finicky lights.

82
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,401
Did you have a Christmas tree, Louise?
- What?

83
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,487
Did you have a Christmastree at home?
- Yes, I still do.

84
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,089
Who trimmed it?
- I don't know.

85
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm not there now.
- But when you used to live there?

86
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,204
I did.

87
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,603
What color were your Christmas balls?
- Everything.

88
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,967
Evert color?
- Everything, yes.

89
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,889
And colored lights, or only white?
- A bit of everything.

90
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,123
It's beautiful like this.

91
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,369
I was born aboard ship.

92
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,768
So I lived on board as a child
and as a young woman.

93
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,609
Later on,
when we had a boyfriend...

94
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,923
...we still stayed on board.

95
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,529
But when we were married,
we went on a ship with that boy.

96
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,126
Because he was a skipper too.

97
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,205
But then we set sail again,
except that now there were the two of us.

98
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,963
That's a nice blouse.
- There we go again.

99
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,522
That's not a blouse, it's a dress.

100
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,843
It's gorgeous.
- Oh my God.

101
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,371
What about mine?
- It's nice too.

102
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,570
You've already seen it 27 times.
- But that one is more elegant.

103
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,481
François, do you want some?

104
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,845
Edwine, would you like a glass of wine?
- Yes.

105
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
To your health.

106
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,448
Enjoy your meal everyone.

107
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,762
Anita, all the way over there.

108
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:31,287
We went by ship to France three times
just to get some wine.

109
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,841
By boat?
- For Belgium, yes.

110
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,846
By ship. A boat is not a ship, you know.

111
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
What's the difference?

112
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,726
A ship is something people live on.
It's their house.

113
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,562
And a boat is something
just to ride around in.

114
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,247
We went to Germany
to France.

115
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,244
We went everywhere.

116
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,085
Now they're gone again.
I don't know where to.

117
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,000
But...
- Are you talking about your children?

118
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,561
Your children have gone.

119
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,771
Your children.
- My children?

120
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,447
You said your son
was going on a trip.

121
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,283
I don't know...
- No one told me anything.

122
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,250
Lia...
- We were coming too, right?

123
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,122
Can we toast?
- If that's what you want, we'll all do it.

124
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,840
To a delicious meal.
- Cheers.

125
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,128
If you don't drink anything,
it stays full.

126
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,524
That's right. Marieke, but I do think
that you already drank a lot.

127
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,967
Water.
- Yes?

128
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,169
How can that be?
Did I miss anything?

129
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,443
François is wearing a beautiful rose.

130
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,171
Yes. Where did you steal that?

131
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,564
François.
- You're wearing a beautiful flower.

132
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,090
François,
where did you steal that flower?

133
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,608
They just put it on.
- It looks good on you.

134
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,888
Where did you nick that?

135
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,649
Suddenly he's deaf.
- Which girl gave it to you?

136
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,122
You can put it that way too.
- Your girlfriend?

137
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,690
We won't get an answer guys.

138
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,046
You're right, honey
You're right. Don't tell.

139
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,248
Keeping silent is the best policy.

140
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,005
My son is in this photograph...

141
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,168
...and my son-in-law.

142
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,767
In the second row...

143
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,366
...that's my daughter..

144
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,323
...and a son-in-law and my son...

145
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,280
...and another son...

146
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,284
...and a daughter.

147
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,531
And my other daughter.

148
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,730
And that's our Ellen.

149
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,490
And our Jos, and me.

150
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,050
In between.

151
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,130
And that's our Diane.

152
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,484
And that's our what's-his-face.

153
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,522
All right, say it.

154
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,651
I'll be damned if I know.

155
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,323
Our Jos, our Staf.

156
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,811
Our Lief.
- Our Lief.

157
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,650
Now I've lost it completely.

158
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,044
Our Lief...

159
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,405
...and our Greet.

160
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,885
Do you have to peel the potatoes?
- I don't have to.

161
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,687
I may

162
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,287
I'll help you.

163
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,728
Alice, where is François?
He's not here.

164
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,928
He went to the Bijster.

165
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,523
How come?
- Who knows?

166
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,523
I don't know.
- We don't know.

167
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,691
Why did he have to go?

168
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,488
Why did he have to go?

169
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,848
Them and their quirks.

170
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,806
Being sent to the Bijster
is kind of like a demotion.

171
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,444
That means you can't cope here.
That was probably true in his case as well.

172
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,448
He's already been replaced
by that little brat.

173
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,762
That little lady.

174
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,162
Do tell.
- She's sitting on the couch.

175
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,845
It will be Mardi Gras soon.
- I've never celebrated that in my whole life.

176
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,606
No?
- No, I lived in the Netherlands.

177
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,889
Don't they have over there?
- Only in the south.

178
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,568
But I didn't live in the south,
so I never wore a nice costume.

179
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,484
You poor thing!

180
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,246
I bought Mardi Gras costumes
on Saturday.

181
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,210
For the kids?
- Yes, of course.

182
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,524
Caro picked out a nice one for me.
- And?

183
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,843
What does it look like?
- Hot pink.

184
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,284
With a blond wig.
It's called Mega Mindy.

185
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,844
Of the "Pink Ballets" probably.
- You should have a picture taken.

186
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,685
I had to buy a Mega Mindy suit.

187
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,890
She said that they also had them
for grown-ups. That was true.

188
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,202
Then you should have a picture taken.

189
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,763
Or was one taken already?
- I didn't buy it, silly.

190
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,289
You call me silly?
How dare you?

191
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,206
It's a super-tight outfit
that reveals every lump.

192
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,091
I'm not wearing that.

193
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,163
You look beautiful.

194
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,482
You have a nice head of hair.

195
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,887
You're jealous. I get that.
- Me too.

196
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,331
Yes, I get that.
Tonight I'll look different again.

197
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,642
Go for a pee now, Edwine.
Then go to your room and I'll come by.

198
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,885
There's your room. I'll come by soon.
First go for a pee.

199
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,762
Is that her room?
- Yes. Yours is a bit further down.

200
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,209
Come on, Louise.

201
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,970
I'll rub some lotion on your legs.

202
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,611
Is this all right?

203
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,202
First I have to take my shoes off.
- Go ahead.

204
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,729
Could you help me?
- I will. I'll help you.

205
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,684
Come along.

206
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,126
Here are your pills.

207
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,080
Put up your legs.

208
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,284
I'm so tired. Terrible.

209
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,891
Thank you. I'll pray for you.

210
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,125
Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

211
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,123
Sleep tight.

212
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,724
Are you all going to bed at once?

213
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,170
We can't do it twice.
- I mean you and Mariëtte.

214
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,089
Let's see if you can go in, Alice.
I'll come and help you in a minute.

215
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,165
Hold on. We'll pull this one down.

216
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,210
I'll give you a dry one for the night.

217
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,331
Would you like to sit down?
- I certainly would.

218
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,925
Once you're in bed,
I'll come and see if everything's all right.

219
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,880
I'm sure it will be.
- Yes, but I'll come and check.

220
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,281
Fine.

221
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,844
Sleep tight, guys.

222
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,605
Good night.

223
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,725
Voilà.

224
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,521
That was good.

225
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,368
What do you think? Are you ready?
Can I ask you now?

226
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,491
Do you know what day of the week
it is today?

227
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,282
What day of the week it is today?

228
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,289
Just a minute.

229
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,524
Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday Friday Saturday?

230
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,163
Do you know which year this is?

231
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,604
The year

232
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,524
Anita, do you know the year?
- April, May.

233
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,844
We're not going to call a helpline.
Do you know which year it is?

234
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,931
No, I don't.

235
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,007
I have that calendar in front of my nose.
It says June 4 if I'm not mistaken.

236
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,811
Your eyes are good.
- They are.

237
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,089
But we weren't going to the optometrist.
- No, we weren't.

238
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,050
We were going to the...

239
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,409
The psychologist.

240
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,526
It doesn't matter.
- Something like it.

241
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,004
That doctor prescribes medication
for your memory.

242
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,803
But you still feel that you're not quite sure
which day year or month...

243
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,490
That's not that surprising.
I led a regular life at home.

244
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,407
I did certain things on certain days.
I attended lectures.

245
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,849
Lately I had a singing lesson
once a week...

246
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,163
...and there was something else I did.

247
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,484
It was regular. Here I'm just sitting around.
Sometimes we go to the Bijster...

248
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,564
...and I know that's on a Wednesday
because we eat there.

249
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,927
Other than that not a lot happens.

250
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,731
That's why I don't know
which day it is exactly.

251
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,124
Do you know where we are?
In which town, which country?

252
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,647
Here? In Belgium.
- In Belgium. That's right.

253
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,003
And in which province or city?

254
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,484
Wondelgem.

255
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,645
Are we in Wommelgem?
- Wondelgem.

256
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,610
Antwerp.
- The province of Antwerp.

257
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,925
And in which village are we?

258
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,524
Yes, that's...

259
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,326
Essen.

260
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,168
And how do you call this building?
The house you live in now?

261
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,163
The Bijster.

262
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,642
And our ward?

263
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,249
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know it has its own name.

264
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,289
Go on.
Maybe it will come to me.

265
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,240
And the address?
- What's the address again?

266
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,128
I don't know.
I just don't know.

267
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,207
86 Nieuwstraat.

268
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,330
16 Nieuwweg.

269
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,085
Iduna.

270
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,049
I was born in this house.

271
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,366
In Ede. I never saw it again,
so I don't know what they did to it.

272
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,206
It's a Heritage building.
Nothing can be changed on the outside.

273
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,328
I don't know what they did
to the inside.

274
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,761
It must still be the same.
My parents already changed the garden.

275
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,890
But the house itself
can't be changed.

276
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,167
That's the Heimans coat of arms.
I don't know how we got that.

277
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,121
My father found it and had it framed.
And now I have it.

278
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,763
It hung in our house
and I took it, of course.

279
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,490
That painting was painted by a painter
in Ede, Jan Eversen.

280
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,688
I was 29.

281
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,041
I don't know why it was made.
For some reason, my parents had it done.

282
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,570
I was...what did I say? 18, I believe.
Yes, 18 is about right.

283
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,411
What else do I have? Nothing.
Just the usual stuff everyone...

284
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,722
...could have in their cupboards.

285
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,484
Right! That's true.

286
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,521
The one at the back is my grandfather.

287
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,489
My father's father.

288
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,086
Hold on, it was my husband.

289
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,881
That was my husband around the time
he died. He was 80 then.

290
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,203
He was a lot older than I was,
but we got along very well.

291
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,044
Beside him is my father
And that's my mother when she was only..

292
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,724
...In her early thirties or something.

293
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,681
That's a very good friend of mine
who died a long time ago.

294
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,291
And that's the son of...
For the life of me, I can't remember.

295
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,162
It's the son of...
Oh, of that friend of mine.

296
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,610
Or a grandson of hers. Something like that,
but I'm not entirely sure.

297
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,800
That's about all I can tell you
about this room.

298
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,442
It's an ordinary boarding room.

299
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,124
That's our Mom.

300
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,171
That was taken during...

301
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,010
...Napoleon's time.

302
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,682
She was English.

303
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,524
That was my grandmother.

304
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,450
She was only 18 there.
She's holding a flower.

305
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,521
And her hair was long.

306
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,243
It was all wavy Down to here.

307
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:53,645
That was my Mom's sister.

308
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,443
Where do you sit, Bertje? Here?
- That's the chair.

309
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,523
You go and sit over there.

310
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,482
You're sitting over there.
- Oh, here.

311
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,809
It's tea.

312
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,251
Do you drink tea? Then you need a glass.
- It's a cup.

313
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,806
Do you want it in a cup?

314
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,046
Can I have that glass for the tea?

315
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,123
You want tea, don't you?

316
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,966
Who has a nice story?
- Louise, you've got an anecdote.

317
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,727
About those millions
you won once.

318
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,604
We know that one by heart.

319
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,606
I've never heard it.
- I'm sure you haven't. Do tell.

320
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,049
I dreamed it, of course.
- Ah, you dreamed it.

321
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,330
I won something...

322
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,047
...and it was a box of money..

323
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,287
...and I looked at it and thought:
Oh, a bit of money A few lousy francs.

324
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,922
And I opened it
and it was a million.

325
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,931
A million francs?

326
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,081
Was it in bills?
- In my sleep. I told you.

327
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,005
That what I dreamed.

328
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,803
A huge stack of money
underneath my bed.

329
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,844
I got up in the morning. I looked underneath
my bed and there were only dust bunnies.

330
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,049
No million. Nothing.

331
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,487
No, it all disappeared.

332
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,848
I bet you were happy for a short while.

333
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,211
That was at school. I don't know
which school, but it was a school.

334
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,170
No, it was here.

335
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,927
Was it here? I don't remember

336
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,166
Louise calls it a school.
- Yes, but I had to sleep there, didn't I?

337
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,201
Weren't you always at boarding school?
Your parents were skippers, right?

338
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,844
From the time we were ten
the Belgian state made us go to school.

339
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,210
So we had to go to school.
- Compulsory education.

340
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,651
We were...
How shall I say this...

341
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,441
...not French. Not Walloons.

342
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,731
They went in Belgium, but...

343
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:03,891
...but Wallonia to school. But we
didn't speak French. Just oui and non.

344
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,682
I did a lot wrong with that.

345
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,562
Someone came on shore there...

346
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,087
...and he spoke French.

347
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,210
Oui and non was the only thing I knew.

348
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,049
And he said something
and I said to him: oui, oui.

349
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,124
And then our Mom came...

350
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,045
...and that gentleman said...

351
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,807
...in French
and she didn't speak French either.

352
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,361
Our Mom was English.

353
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,444
And he chattered away in French.
Who knows what he was saying.

354
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,845
He had a package. What was in it?
We didn't know.

355
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,164
Our Mom said: non, non.

356
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,644
Non, non. That was the only thing
she could say and: oui, oui.

357
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,683
And I had said: oui, oui. So he brought
something. I don't know what.

358
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,650
And our Mom said: non, non, non, non.

359
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,810
Give me your hand.

360
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,082
And now get off the steps.

361
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,289
We're here.
We can't go any further.

362
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,171
We can't go any further.
This is as deep as it gets.

363
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,369
It won't get any deeper
It's the same everywhere.

364
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,810
It's the same everywhere.
- Now we can cross the pool.

365
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,611
We can skip through the pool like this.

366
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,842
If you want to try and swim,
you can.

367
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,681
No, I don't want to.

368
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,049
This is fine. You're in the water.

369
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,847
This is fun, isn't it?

370
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,050
And there is Alice.

371
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,606
Yvette, Yvette.

372
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,569
Yvette, get it.

373
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,211
Have you got it, Yvette?

374
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,570
And now right on top
of Alice's head.

375
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,524
What's this?

376
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,884
Kick.

377
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,649
OK. That's great.

378
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,010
Shall we try to swim?

379
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,322
Come on. Let go.

380
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,687
Let it go when you're ready.

381
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,844
Leave it up to me.
I've got you.

382
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,647
Not yet?

383
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,287
You won't go down.
I'm holding you.

384
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,364
You can't sink,
because my hands are here.

385
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,006
I can only tickle you.

386
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,529
Well done. You see?
Are we going that way?

387
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,007
Here, here.
- They're going to bother us over there.

388
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:53,849
We've been washed thoroughly right?
- From head to toe.

389
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,084
Massage in the swimming pool.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

390
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,566
I'm getting a massage
in the swimming pool.

391
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,524
Now you can't tell they're sweaty feet.
- Is it OK? Boy they're stinky.

392
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,126
You'll be able to dance well.
- Yes, I'm good at dancing.

393
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,049
I love that what's-it-called waltz.

394
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,201
The Weseke waltz.

395
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,850
The waltz?

396
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,528
We danced yesterday didn't we?
- Did we? I don't remember

397
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,605
I do. As long as I remember
it's all right, isn't it?

398
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,366
You're lucky aren't you?

399
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,568
I sure am.

400
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,051
This is me with our Lief.

401
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,681
And this is me with our Lief as well.
Except different.

402
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,243
With different clothes.

403
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,686
And this is me with a former boyfriend.

404
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,843
I had a boyfriend.
- Really?

405
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,923
But it slowly fizzled out.

406
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,650
But I'm still leaving it up there.

407
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,282
Where's your boyfriend right now?
- I don't know.

408
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,003
I don't know.

409
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,404
I don't have feelings anymore for him,
so...

410
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,962
...I don't know.
- The love was over and done with.

411
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,043
For me it wasn't.

412
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,729
But it has to come from both sides.

413
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,687
That's my husband.
- Yes, Rik.

414
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,766
It says Rik in big letters.

415
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,006
I do jigsaws like crazy
I like it.

416
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,165
I can use my head
and it keeps me occupied.

417
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,688
I don't feel like doing nothing
but sitting around all day long.

418
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,407
That was on my wedding day

419
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,080
I was standing on a bench.

420
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,531
The groom was a tall guy
and I was short. That's why..

421
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:02,451
...there was a bench
Otherwise I'd only reach his armpits.

422
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:09,131
The people who were going to take
the picture said:

423
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,363
"That doesn't look good."

424
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,808
"You're only this big."

425
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:23,481
"Being together in a picture doesn't make
any sense. You'll have to stand on a bench."

426
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,247
"Then you'll be as tall as your husband."

427
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,883
That's why there was a bench there.

428
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,806
But you couldn't see it.
All those flowers were in front of it.

429
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,726
You can't see
that because of those flowers...

430
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,003
...how shall I put it...

431
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,481
...there was a bench.

432
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,450
That's it.

433
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,602
Can you hand me that knife?

434
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,525
Hey stop that!

435
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,402
What are you thinking?
You're using the sharp side of the knife.

436
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,845
Alzheimer's is something that occurs
at this age.

437
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,890
So, really I'm not the only one.

438
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,207
I can't even tell
when someone has it.

439
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,569
You can often tell by the responses.

440
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,207
I think: He'll probably have it.
But no one talks about it.

441
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,131
No one discusses it.

442
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,803
No, it's private.

443
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,445
I'm going to say three things.
Repeat after me and remember them.

444
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,691
Book.

445
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,845
Plant.

446
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,250
Windmill.

447
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,604
Those three things I mentioned...
- I have to remember them.

448
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,683
Jeez, my bones.

449
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,922
I think we're up to it.
Do you know "kamer" (room)?

450
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,880
We're going to try
to spell that backwards.

451
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,602
Kamer.
- Yes. The last letter?

452
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,605
Rens?

453
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,969
R? And then? And before that?

454
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,600
Rens? Kamer?
- Kamer.

455
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,051
We're going to spell it backwards.
What's the last letter?

456
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,168
I can't remember.

457
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,765
Rekam.

458
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,682
No, remak.
- And letter by letter?

459
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,003
R...

460
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,323
A... No, E...

461
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,560
M...

462
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,284
A...

463
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,090
Kamer.
- That's it.

464
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,564
I asked you to remember three words.

465
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,088
Do you remember what words they were?

466
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,206
No.

467
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,371
Which words they were.

468
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,965
Rens?

469
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,682
That's your name.
You're called Louise Rens.

470
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,241
Rens?

471
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,366
Mother?

472
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,047
"Kamer" was one.
I don't remember.

473
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,921
You had to remember three words.
Was "kamer" one of them?

474
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,730
In the middle, I think.

475
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,526
I don't know.

476
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,925
I had to put it backwards
and I ended up with "remak."

477
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,850
I don't know.
- You don't?

478
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,847
I don't remember.
It's all gone.

479
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,289
Book? Did I say that?

480
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,363
Book?

481
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,930
I don't think so.
Book doesn't sound familiar.

482
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,607
I'll try another word. Plant?
- No.

483
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,048
Didn't you have to remember that?
- I don't think so.

484
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,488
Let's try another one. Windmill?
- Windmill, yes.

485
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,041
Did I say that?
- I think so.

486
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,204
Windmill sounds familiar
Or am I wrong?

487
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,487
That's the wheels on the road.
I hear them.

488
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,723
The corn looks nice
and those horses.

489
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,929
They are astonished.

490
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,244
Yes, it's us.
- Those horses are looking at us.

491
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,328
Our Lief is working on it.

492
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,962
Your Lief is working on it.
She's courageous.

493
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,809
It's allowed.
- Right.

494
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,484
She knows that. Right, Alice?

495
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,129
Do we have to go straight ahead?

496
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,728
Do we have to park here?

497
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,847
Hi, Anneke.

498
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,806
Hello.

499
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,928
Come on, guys. Run.

500
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,645
Come on, pedal.
- Pedal. We're going uphill.

501
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,890
You sit over there.

502
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,201
Sit over there?
- You always do.

503
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,249
Yes, on the other side.

504
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,922
Louise is in the wrong chair.

505
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,050
You sit on the other side.
- Louise is in the wrong chair

506
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,000
Louise, you're in the wrong chair.
You always sit over there.

507
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,203
Does it matter where you sit?
- Yes. Everyone has their own chair.

508
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,761
With meals and with coffee.
Exactly.

509
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,806
But doesn't Louise always sit there?
- No, I sit here.

510
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,691
You sit there, where Edwine is now.

511
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,930
That's not true. I always sit here.

512
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,970
Mariëtte sits beside me.

513
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,762
Where do I sit?
- Over there, I think.

514
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,366
Yes, that's right.
- Is this right?

515
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,331
I'm thirsty.

516
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,930
Yes, I believe Alice sits over there.

517
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,125
No, that's not right either
Where does Alice sit?

518
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,285
Alice sits beside Louise.
- Where's Alice?

519
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,162
She went home already.
- No, she's sprawled out over there.

520
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,528
Damn it. Jesus.

521
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,245
It's boiling hot.

522
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,967
Too bad.
- Come quickly Anita.

523
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,647
Take those pants off, quickly.
- Come over here.

524
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,687
Hot tea.
You don't do that on purpose, right?

525
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,051
I said: I don't do that on purpose.

526
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,849
Don't you want one?

527
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,767
You should use a sweetener
That won't make you fat.

528
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,604
Sugar will.

529
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,764
Can I have some more tea?

530
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,246
Didn't you have coffee?

531
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,131
Is that coffee?
- There's tea...

532
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,725
Did you have tea or coffee?

533
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,929
She herself doesn't know.
- I don't know.

534
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,651
What do you want? Tea or coffee?

535
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,650
What do you want? Tea or coffee?
- Coffee.

536
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,967
I'll serve you,
even though it's not my job.

537
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,449
Take your hands out of the way
Your hand!

538
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,882
If I spill any I'll hit your hand.
That just happened to me, so...

539
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,885
Thank you.

540
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,085
It might tip over.
- That's not true.

541
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,720
No?
- That plastic is underneath it.

542
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,451
Why is it lopsided?

543
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,410
She doesn't hear you.
- You have that lying over there.

544
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,564
What?
- Take away that paper from under the cup.

545
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,726
You've got it underneath it. Just put it
beside it. That's the best way.

546
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,848
Is that so hard?

547
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,765
Now she has to put it back on.
Then it's also lopsided.

548
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,571
It's still lopsided.
- My God.

549
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,008
Just put it beside your cup.

550
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,569
Beside your saucer
The way everyone does it.

551
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,170
She should put it in the bucket.
- But then she won't get coffee anymore.

552
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,403
Can't you act normal?
Here's my thing.

553
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,040
You can do that too.
Everyone does that.

554
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,444
Why does it have to lie on top of that cup?
It makes it harder to clear up.

555
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,648
She's always contrary You know that.

556
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,203
When I collect the cups, I first
have to take off that piece. If I don't...

557
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,922
So why is that necessary?
- But you don't clear the table, do you?

558
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,841
Yes, I do.
- No, that's not yes. That's no.

559
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,924
You clear away the cups then. OK?

560
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,087
Tonight she has to do it herself.
- Then we'll have to do it.

561
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,164
My ears are drowning.

562
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,121
Then they'll get a good cleaning.

563
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,926
<i>You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.</i>

564
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:14,842
<i>I haven't seen anything like it for years.
So beautiful.</i>

565
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,004
Right. My singing talent
is recorded too.

566
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,041
My thanks.
- You're welcome.

567
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,882
You may come along.
- You're coming along with me.

568
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,483
Am I pretty?

569
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,963
What do you think?

570
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,884
She's so happy she's coming with me.

571
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,646
I suggest that on the back of the sheet...

572
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,007
...you write a sentence.

573
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,126
I want to write something...
- But you're afraid to.

574
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,126
Don't hold back.
Just write it down.

575
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,369
My house.

576
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,003
Would you like to write: my house?

577
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,246
Try to write down: my house.

578
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,284
My house.

579
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,480
In words. Use words...
- My.. Is that with a Y?

580
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,690
Yes, that's right. MY

581
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:07,811
I think that's a great sentence.
I'll give you top marks.

582
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,244
You were allowed to write down
anything you wanted.

583
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:20,247
Now I think: Being crazy causes no pain.
- That's what you wanted to write down.

584
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,244
<i>And that we're cool guys,
we realize.</i>

585
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,530
<i>That's why we go everywhere.</i>

586
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,847
<i>Everywhere everywhere
where there are girls.</i>

587
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,928
<i>Everywhere, everywhere
where there are girls...</i>

588
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,003
...we <i>can have some twirls.</i>

589
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,844
Change.

590
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,891
<i>Your knees are black Melanie.</i>

591
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,090
<i>Wash them, for that I don't want to see.</i>

592
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,961
<i>And when they have a nice shine...</i>

593
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,887
<i>...stick your feet-</i> change -
<i>close to mine.</i>

594
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:17,030
<i>Oh, Jefke got a wife.
And now he is in trouble.</i>

595
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,170
<i>Oh, Jefke got a wife...</i>

596
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,325
<i>...and now he is in trouble
for the rest of his life.</i>

597
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,087
<i>Humpa humpa
humpa tataraa.</i>

598
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,881
<i>Tataraa, tataraa.</i>

599
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:45,081
Well done, Louise! Aren't you tired?
Then it's all right.

600
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,771
Louise. Hey good morning.

601
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,449
Did you sleep well? Yes?

602
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:04,090
Why don't you get up? Then you can have
some tea and a sandwich.

603
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,806
Today it's Wednesday.

604
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,568
This afternoon we'll go to the hairdresser
Do you still know where that is?

605
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,929
There's that big room
where people dance.

606
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,802
You're going to get a room there.
That's where you'll live.

607
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,724
Live?
- Yes.

608
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,885
That's kind of a home too.
You know what that is, right?

609
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,247
Just like here.

610
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,371
You can go and live there.
They have a room for you.

611
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,447
We'll bring everything along.
Your photographs and your clothes.

612
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,369
And we'll have a look at your new room.
Is that OK? Yes?

613
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,011
Let's eat first. OK?

614
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,725
Those are big boxes, aren't they?

615
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,531
Have you looked to see
what's in them?

616
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,847
Is that for throwing out?
- No, that won't be thrown out.

617
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,651
We'll take that along
to your new room.

618
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,723
These are your dolls.

619
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:21,206
We'll take them along.
They're in the box, ready to be moved.

620
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,489
Isn't that great?
Let's go in here.

621
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,842
Isn't it too hot?
Should I add some cold water?

622
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,769
Go ahead and wash your face.

623
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,042
Freshen up a bit.

624
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:55,201
Look in the mirror What do you think?
Is it all right?

625
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,441
Let's go to the kitchen.

626
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,842
Ma'am.
- Madame.

627
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:09,331
They're all looking at us.
- Why do you think that is?

628
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,370
There are all sorts of things on the table
to put on your bread.

629
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,605
Strawberry jam, chocolate paste.

630
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,560
You choose. Enjoy
I'll be back soon.

631
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,888
Ladies, tonight Louise
is going to live somewhere else.

632
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,403
She's going to live in the Bijster
You know that place, right?

633
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,325
Louise will get a new room there.

634
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,165
That's nice.
- And a good bed.

635
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,606
Why is that?

636
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,491
You'll be cared for very well over there.

637
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,488
We can't give you that kind of care here.

638
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,362
As you're getting older,
you have some tough days sometimes.

639
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,010
That's true.

640
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,930
Do you yourself think
it's tough sometimes?

641
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,562
Then it's always...
- You'll be fine there.

642
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,167
I think so too. Anita says
you'll be fine there.

643
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,561
You'll be fine there.

644
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,049
You'll be well taken care of.
There are a lot of nurses there.

645
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,806
Then it's all right, isn't it?

646
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,601
It's always a bit strange
when you move somewhere else.

647
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,969
You'll get used to it soon.
You get to know the other people.

648
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,521
You'll get used to it.

649
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:05,049
I settled down here,
as you will over there.

650
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,450
Put that in the suitcase.
We'll take it along.

651
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,721
Louise, the pictures.
Shall we put them in too?

652
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:03,205
There are a lot of memories here.
Memories of the boat.

653
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,409
Of that time you were sailing.

654
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,767
Why don't you put it in the suitcase?

655
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,448
Put it right on top.

656
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,844
You can close the suitcase, Louise.

657
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,243
Everything is in it.
You're ready to leave.

658
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,489
I don't think I can push beside that.

659
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,208
Let me help.
Things aren't allowed to fall out, right?

660
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,724
It's heavy.
- I can't carry it.

661
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,044
Let me carry it.
We'll go that way.

662
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,363
There's no way I would want
to go to the Bijster.

663
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,321
A regiment. Awful.
I would find that awful.

664
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,849
If they had sent me there
I don't know what I would have done.

665
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,686
All those people... No.

666
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,448
That nursing home aspect.
At least here it's homey.

667
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,810
But that's a nursing home.
It would drive me nuts.

668
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,404
Here we are. It's downhill now.
We'll just...

669
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,163
it's cold!

670
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,120
A lot of people are stuck together here.
I grew up as an only child.

671
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:16,889
I wasn't used to regiments
and now I'm in the company of nine people.

672
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,202
To me that's a regiment.

673
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,650
I've always been
enormously individualistic.

674
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,083
I don't have a real life here anymore,
of course.

675
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,483
I've been put away
just like this whole bunch.

676
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,202
I don't get too upset about it.
I just do as I please.

677
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,569
But I've been put away here, yes.

678
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,280
I was put away because I once
drove the wrong way with the car

679
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,370
I'm stuck in this joint.
I've been written off.

680
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,531
Of course. You don't end up in a joint
like this when you haven't been written off.

681
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,889
So there's no reason at all for me...

682
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,010
Stop for a minute.

683
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,809
You'd better stop.
This isn't working.

684
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,404
It has to be done right.
Isn't that so, Mariëtte?

685
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,244
I can't imagine Edwine ironing.
I don't think she'd do a good job.

686
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,209
This has become undone.

687
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,408
Ah well, no one will notice.

688
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,728
She'd say: I'm tired.

689
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,247
From doing nothing.

690
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,803
This is one of Edwine's skirts.
If I'd say to her: iron it yourself...

691
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,248
...what do you think she'd say?
"I can't."

692
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,249
I'm sure of that.
- For sure.

693
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,684
It's an annoying skirt, isn't it?

694
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,128
It's all silk.
- I wouldn't iron it too much.

695
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,930
You're right.

696
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,806
It's fine like that.
- It's ready I quit.

697
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,404
Good evening, dear people.

698
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,168
We're looking forward to a fun evening
with the family party

699
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,369
it's great to see so many people here.

700
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,530
How much did I have to drink?
Not much. Only one glass of wine.

701
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:10,006
What can you still sing? Do you remember
the songs you used to sing?

702
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,369
I don't remember anything.
- Nothing?

703
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,809
Down By That Windmill.
Do you know that?

704
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,603
I know that one.

705
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,851
Sing it.
<i>- I love with all my life.</i>

706
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:43,329
<i>Down by that beautiful windmill...</i>

707
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:50,204
<i>...lives a girl
I love with all my life.</i>

708
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:57,608
<i>Down by that beautiful windmill...</i>

709
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,645
...I <i>want to live</i>
<i>when she becomes my wife.</i>

710
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,209
This one is Edwine's. And that...

711
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,091
...that's Bertje's.

712
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,170
We'll take them.

713
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,162
What did you say?
- Here's another box.

714
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,086
A box with picture albums.
- It's Edwine's.

715
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,249
She's been here for nine years.
Then you collect a lot of stuff.

716
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:26,928
<i>Ah Marietje the roses will blossom.</i>

717
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:32,689
<i>Even when I am gone.</i>

718
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:39,530
<i>You'll smile through your fears.</i>
- Tears.

719
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,720
<i>Today we were done.</i>

720
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:50,649
<i>Even if you think it's all gone...</i>

721
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,806
<i>...it's all gone forever.</i>

722
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,763
<i>Ah Marietje my tears will blossom.</i>

723
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,289
<i>Even when I'm gone.</i>

724
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,561
It's over.

725
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,121
Where do we go now?
- To the Bijster.

726
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,323
We'll see each other at the Bijster.

727
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,245
See you in a couple of days.

728
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,128
I wouldn't want to go there.

729
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,563
Me neither

730
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,171
I think I'd take pills.

731
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,082
I'd take pills so I'd die.

732
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,322
You're not there yet.

733
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,882
They are younger than you are,
but you're not there yet.

734
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,486
I don't want to go there.

735
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,767
I'm not looking forward to it either
but if there's no other way..

736
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,927
You wouldn't go?
That's an option!

737
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,448
I don't think that we have to be
that afraid of it.

738
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,241
I'd take pills
before I'd go there.

739
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,051
I mean what I'm saying.

740
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,804
Boy-o-boy Marieke.

741
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,885
What did you say?
- That I wouldn't go there.

742
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,408
I take pills so I'd die.
- That's one way out.

743
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:49,249
I'm thinking along the same lines.
- I'd ask Wm to give me pills.

744
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,884
Wm won't do that.
He'll give you one if you really ask.

745
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,850
But it's not easy to get.

746
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,800
If there's nothing wrong with you,
you won't get it. No way.

747
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,247
Doctors are doctors, after all.

748
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,201
They don't just kill someone
because they enjoy it.
