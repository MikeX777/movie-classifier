1
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,855
EVERY DAY, CRUEL AND APPARENTLY
INEXPLICABLE THINGS HAPPEN.

2
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,442
ONLY THROUGH A FAITHFUL
RECONSTRUCTION OF THESE INCIDENTS...

3
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:04,406
IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
DRAMATIC AND DISTURBING SIGNIFICANCE.

4
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,789
Come on, harder.
Kick it in.

5
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,426
Come on, men, let's start.

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,181
Call the pathology department.

7
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,435
And somebody writes this down:
School books and notebooks...

8
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,859
cardigan, blouse, blue trousers.

9
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,397
White nylon briefs.

10
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,697
- Half-boots...
- The public prosecutor is here.

11
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,369
Show him in.

12
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,538
- Well?
- It's a lady...

13
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,926
It's a young girl.
No more than fifteen.

14
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,802
She tied the rope
around the beam...

15
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,351
put her head into the noose...
and down.

16
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,849
- Do you know who she is?
- Not yet.

17
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,476
We couldn't find
any papers.

18
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,184
The pages of the notebooks
with her name on them were ripped out.

19
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,897
- Who owns the garret?
- We're checking it out now.

20
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,113
Who knows why she did it...

21
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,571
We had to break the door down
to get in.

22
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,877
Why did she undress herself?

23
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,373
Who knows what goes through
a girl's head...

24
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,801
- who decided to commit suicide.
- How did you find out about this?

25
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,254
An anonymous phone call.
A men's voice.

26
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,682
He only said that
somebody hanged himself here.

27
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,760
May we take the body away now?

28
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,438
Inspector, please write your report
as quickly as possible.

29
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,014
Of course.

30
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,526
Let's get her down.

31
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,853
Yes, sir, a minor.

32
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,734
Perhaps she ran away from home.

33
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,487
- One of many.
<i>- And the parents?</i>

34
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,410
So far we know nothing
about them.

35
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,911
And no girls were reported missing
in the last few days.

36
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,207
But considering I've only been here
for a short while, I've already settled in well.

37
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,794
Thank you anyway.
I'll keep you informed.

38
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,719
Now take a look at this.

39
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,638
Wouldn't it be enough
to only photograph her face?

40
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,840
Yes, I've seen it.

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,016
But in cases like this,
the photographers can't believe their luck.

42
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,891
- What have you got, Valentini?
- The results of the autopsy.

43
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,892
The girl wasn't older than fifteen.

44
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,815
She had complete
sexual intercourse...

45
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,813
shortly before
she killed herself.

46
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,943
Integral intercourse.
So she didn't use any contraceptives.

47
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,778
They found traces of sperm in the vagina,
as well as in the anus and the stomach.

48
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,034
Death occurred yesterday afternoon,
on Tuesday.

49
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,206
Between 5 and 6 p.m.

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,456
The girl was expecting.

51
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,914
- She was pregnant?
- Yes, about two months.

52
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,307
- Did you call the police?
- Yes. It's her, it's Silvia.

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,064
How horrible.
I immediately recognised her in the papers.

54
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,737
My God, the poor thing.

55
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,914
- Where are her parents?
- In Africa.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,461
They own a factory down there.
They departed a week ago.

57
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,633
- Since when has she been missing?
- Since Tuesday afternoon.

58
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,710
Why didn't you call the police
right away?

59
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,469
It wasn't the first time
this happened.

60
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,802
Also that she stayed out
all night?

61
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,482
When her father wasn't home,
it happened.

62
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,108
Silvia always managed to get everything
she wanted from her mother.

63
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,492
- How old was she?
- Not yet fifteen.

64
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,751
Did she have
any acquaintances?

65
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,297
By that I mean...
did she have a boyfriend?

66
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,544
You know anything about that?

67
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,875
When she was little,
she used to tell me things...

68
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,090
but she stopped doing so when...
when she became a woman.

69
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,570
Someone's calling all the time.
I'm so afraid.

70
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,161
What am I going to tell
her parents?

71
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,163
We'll take care of that.

72
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,131
And what's this?

73
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,720
She always wore it around her neck.
Until recently.

74
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:39,161
This is footage shot
by our undercover officers...

75
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,412
during a demonstration
and the riots...

76
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,211
in the centre of town
a few days ago.

77
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,288
Watch carefully here.

78
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,884
We have to take a closer look
at the shots of these three.

79
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,257
Rewind.

80
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,430
They can be identified here,
Ms. public prosecutor.

81
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,555
Stop here.
Mario Felici.

82
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,977
- Student?
- Part-time student.

83
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,476
He's a professional agitator.

84
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,729
- Alright, let's go on.
- Play.

85
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,565
An old acquaintance,
you might say.

86
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,367
An extremist, on record.

87
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,287
- Violent.
- Please go on.

88
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,793
- Excuse me, I was at the girl's house...
- We need to finish this first.

89
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,755
Giovanni Vici, nineteen years old.

90
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,965
- May I see the scene before this again?
- Rewind.

91
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,094
Stop here.

92
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,771
Can you enlarge it?

93
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,862
isn't that the girl
who hanged herself?

94
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,820
- Russo, when was this shot?
- The day before yesterday.

95
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,993
- On Tuesday. What hour?
- Must have been around 5, 5.30 p.m.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,946
That's when we started
to observe that house.

97
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,409
Nobody left it again until midnight.
I was there.

98
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,743
Do you understand, Valentini?

99
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,043
Neither did Silvia
leave it before midnight.

100
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,795
But Silvia was already dead then.

101
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,590
She wasn't already dead.
She had already been murdered.

102
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,648
Did they give you my report?

103
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,606
I already took a look inside.
An ugly affair.

104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,909
I'm sorry, but the case
is now within your jurisdiction.

105
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,829
It first looked like suicide,
but now it's clear that she was murdered.

106
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,749
And during the night,
they shifted the corpse into the garret...

107
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,667
at the other side of the town.

108
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,707
- Are you going to take me or not?
- Wait in the car. I'll be there in a minute.

109
00:09:55,637 --> 00:10:00,598
In a way, I'm relieved
that the case is with you now.

110
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:06,145
This girl, Silvia...
was the same age as my daughter.

111
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,990
Let's go, Giardina.
We'll start with the garret.

112
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,695
Alright.
The coroner is already waiting for us.

113
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:42,177
There, you see?
The body was hanging here, next to the table.

114
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,300
The thing is:

115
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,978
The killer did everything
terribly impeccable.

116
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,807
He didn't only strangle her
before he strung up her body on that beam...

117
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,941
but must have also pulled the body down
with all his force...

118
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,773
until the
cervical vertebra broke.

119
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,986
Now, according to the results
of the autopsy...

120
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,492
- he consequently...
- Stop, don't move.

121
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,699
I said, don't move.

122
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,127
- But it's the assistant public prosecutor.
- He mustn't move either.

123
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,506
Somebody's watching us
from the balcony of the opposite building.

124
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:21,008
With a binocular or something like that.
Top floor. Go, Giardina.

125
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,215
I'm the assistant public prosecutor,
Vittoria Stori.

126
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,436
We'll have to reconstruct the girl's life
minute for minute.

127
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,985
But this has got to be a joke, inspector.
Are you trying to tell me...

128
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,786
that someone who photographs as a hobby
is committing a crime?

129
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,540
Why did you pick that garret
as your target today of all days?

130
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,870
I didn't pick anything as a target.
This is not a cannon....

131
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,204
Here, inspector.

132
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,337
We've printed the film.

133
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,221
Well, Mr. Paglia,
take a good look.

134
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,512
This girl was killed.

135
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,844
Now I'm asking you
to collaborate with the law.

136
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:15,649
But look, I...
I took them by sheer chance.

137
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,067
And when I saw that thing -
terrible, I must say...

138
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,737
- Did you call the police?
- But of course.

139
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,532
- There, you see that I am collaborating.
- And this photo? And that one?

140
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,984
And this one?
All of them by chance?

141
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,663
Well, first off, it needs to be assessed
whether a free citizen may or may not do this.

142
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,285
Indeed, it has to be assessed.

143
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,663
In the meantime,
you're in investigative custody.

144
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,165
Call your lawyer if you like.

145
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,250
These are enlargements of the photos
we found in Paglia's apartment.

146
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:46,305
This is Silvia Polvesi.
The boy is always the same.

147
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,012
They must've been certain
that nobody could watch them.

148
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,472
But Paglia could shoot them
from the opposite building.

149
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,474
They look so happy.

150
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,281
I'd say they had no inhibitions.

151
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,280
They're just two youths.

152
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,741
Yes, two youths.

153
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,620
But they did things for adults.

154
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,707
Now it won't be difficult
to find that boy.

155
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,859
You know this man?

156
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,529
- Yeah, that's Marcello.
- And where is he?

157
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,482
- He's underground.
- Underground where?

158
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,783
In the grotto.
Almost 300 feet down.

159
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,613
- How long has he been buried there?
- For four days.

160
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,705
- Tell him to come up.
- And why?

161
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,581
Because I need to talk to him.
Police.

162
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,287
What does Marcello have to do
with the police?

163
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,965
Make him come up,
I'm asking the questions.

164
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,463
Fabio. Call Marcello.

165
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,466
- Come on, call Marcello.
- Marcello, you hear me? Over.

166
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,172
We've found him, but I don't think
he has anything to do with it.

167
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,382
I'm excluding him.
He's been underground since Sunday.

168
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,889
<i>Underground?
What do you mean?</i>

169
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,595
He's a cave explorer
or something.

170
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,851
<i>But Silvestri,
the girl had intercourse...</i>

171
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,309
<i>shortly before she was killed.
And that was on Tuesday.</i>

172
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,143
Indeed.

173
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,774
But then Silvia
had another lover.

174
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,071
Yes, a lethal lover.

175
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,113
She wasn't even fifteen years old...

176
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,995
It's enough.
What else do you want from me?

177
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,827
I don't even want to hear
her name anymore, understand?

178
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,458
Ask these questions
to the other chap.

179
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,258
I only know...
that she disgusts me.

180
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,387
Don't you understand
that Silvia is only the victim?

181
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,261
And her murderer
is precisely that other fellow.

182
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,218
And you're the only one
who can help us finding him.

183
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:43,398
Did you know that Silvia was underage?
You realise what that means?

184
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,103
For how long did you have
a sexual relationship?

185
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,825
We met each other
three months ago.

186
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,527
By chance.

187
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,825
- We fell in love on the spot.
- And the garret?

188
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,374
That was a surprise.

189
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,545
A surprise she could afford.

190
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,089
I knew little
about Silvia's family.

191
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,668
But they had to be well-off.

192
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,755
Silvia had enough of everything.
Be it money or time.

193
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:19,309
Of which I surely have much less.
But I liked her, and she liked me.

194
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,636
And that was enough for me.

195
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,442
She had rented that garret.

196
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,769
It was our hideaway.

197
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,442
Where we made love.

198
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,989
- Is that where she was killed?
- We don't know yet.

199
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,912
Was she a virgin?

200
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,242
- Why is that important?
- Were you the first?

201
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,230
Would you please sign here?

202
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,446
Seems like we've found the apartment
where the girl was killed.

203
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,451
We need your authorisation
to break the door open.

204
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,783
- You have it.
- Go ahead, Giardina..

205
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,118
Are you sure, though?

206
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,873
We searched the building
top to bottom.

207
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,672
Luckily we found out the name
of the tenant.

208
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,750
You found the tenant?

209
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,209
Well, then...

210
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,386
He's someone
who pays on time every month.

211
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,386
It's just that he's been dead
for three years.

212
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,147
Call Pathology, Giardina.

213
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,186
It's just a formality.

214
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,022
We don't need them to see
that this is blood in saliva.

215
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,700
I'm sure that the girl
was strangled right here...

216
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,652
and then taken to the garret
when she was dead.

217
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,158
Search the entire apartment.

218
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,829
A tape-recorder.

219
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,005
It was hidden inside this wall.
And no tapes, of course.

220
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,583
I bet forensics
won't find a single fingerprint.

221
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:24,171
Inspector.
Inspector, take a look at this over here.

222
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,500
But this is horrible.

223
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,578
This makes it two crimes.

224
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,006
Now we have to find out
who's the second victim.

225
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,513
- Sign here.
- What is he, your brother?

226
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,680
Sign here, Mr. Paglia.

227
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,011
Sign it.

228
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,314
And my best regards
to the inspector.

229
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,266
- What is this?
- The lawyer...

230
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,148
This is the chief prosecutor's
realisation...

231
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,775
- that this has been a misunderstanding.
- Which means?

232
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,073
Well, my clear inspector,
times have changed.

233
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,028
In the past, the suspicion of a guard post
was sufficient to bring a respectable citizen...

234
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,329
I've never met
a respectable citizen...

235
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,534
who took pictures of dead bodies
by sheer chance.

236
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,166
Anyway, you're free to go.
For now.

237
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,334
Does he expect me to be grateful now?

238
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,011
Finally. Can it be possible
that you can't tell us anything?

239
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,713
We have to write
something about it, inspector.

240
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,594
- Do you have a lead?
- Tell us something.

241
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,595
- In what state is the investigation?
- Inspector Silvestri.

242
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,599
Why did the police suppress the story
of this new killing for 24 hours?

243
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,976
Because forensics
had to make absolutely sure...

244
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,478
that it's actually human blood.

245
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,606
You tried to solve a crime
and accidentally came across another?

246
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,279
- Is there a link...?
- Are you certain...

247
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,403
that little Polvesi was killed
in the same apartment?

248
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,325
One question at a time, gentlemen,
or I will refuse to answer.

249
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,197
It's fact that
you have nothing to tell us.

250
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,824
I'm telling you everything I know.

251
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,703
- You don't even listen to us.
- You ask the questions for all of them.

252
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,787
Inspector Silvestri, the fact that
two people were killed at the same place...

253
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,292
allows for the presumption
that you're dealing with a monster.

254
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,750
- A maniac.
- There's no reason to presume this.

255
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,757
Sure, these are conjectures.
But they're quite justified...

256
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,463
considering the sparse facts
you're supplying us with.

257
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,049
First of all, we have to identify
the second victim.

258
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,260
Don't you think the second victim
might also be a girl?

259
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,221
That might indicate the existence
of a madman, of a sex maniac in this city.

260
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,147
If you want to know
whether it's a girl...

261
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,771
you'll have to wait
for the histological evidence.

262
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,274
Regarding the theory
of the monster:

263
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,482
Since you have to sell newspapers...
just go ahead and publish it.

264
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,738
You will cause a panic
among the public.

265
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,535
We will take care of the public.

266
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,953
You better think about
finding the killer.

267
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,997
We will find him...

268
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,997
as long as
you don't tie us in red tape.

269
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,590
This is a disgrace.
Lovers, a double life, even drugs..

270
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:10,045
She was just a child.
How can you permit such a thing?

271
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,554
How can these people be allowed
to print articles like that?

272
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,188
You're right,
but the press is the press.

273
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,517
And naturally they like to embellish things
with lots of fantasy.

274
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,985
Your daughter's a victim.

275
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,860
But unfortunately,
it's my duty to get to the bottom of it.

276
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,282
What do you want to know
from me?

277
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,361
Did you have the confidence
of your daughter?

278
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,659
Silvia adored me.

279
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,997
I asked you if she confided in you.

280
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,003
With me,
there was always fighting...

281
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,839
but adoration for her father.

282
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,433
I thought it was just a phase
all girls go through.

283
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,895
But then...

284
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,442
Then...

285
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,240
when I accidentally
found out...

286
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,240
that Silvia
was not a virgin anymore...

287
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,705
I became frightened.

288
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,119
You knew it?
Since when?

289
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,837
One day I found pills...

290
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,043
in her jacket pocket.

291
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,509
Pills for birth control.

292
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,387
I refused to believe it.

293
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,935
She was still a little girl.

294
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,372
What is it?

295
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,840
Silvia, where did you get these?

296
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,303
In a chemist.
That's where I buy them.

297
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,059
Silvia... But...

298
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,602
- Mother, please don't make a drama out of it.
- What are you saying?

299
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,688
- You're still a little girl.
- Of course, a little girl.

300
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,070
Only that I'm capable of
bearing a child every nine months...

301
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,868
When your father
hears about this.

302
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,663
Because I will tell your father.
You'll see that I'll tell him.

303
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,493
Just try it.
Then I will cut my throat.

304
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,455
She told me
she'd carry it always with her.

305
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,712
"If you tell my father,
I will cut my throat."

306
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:59,051
Of course I would've never had the strength
to tell it to my husband.

307
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,099
I even hired a policeman.

308
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,348
I didn't know what I should do.
I was desperate.

309
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,276
- A private detective, you know?
- What's his name?

310
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,353
A certain Talenti.

311
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,573
At first he calmed me down,
but then...

312
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,617
after a few days he told me
he couldn't take care of it anymore.

313
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,695
He had other things to do.

314
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,623
At heart I was almost
pleased with that.

315
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,077
The man seemed
a little shady.

316
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,043
- Talenti you said?
- Yes. Ruggero Talenti.

317
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:39,638
Talenti, Ruggero, thirty-four years-old,
born in Schio, gun license...

318
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,932
married...
background check in progress.

319
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,937
- So, did you find him?
- His office has been closed for five days.

320
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,141
I made an inquiry at headquarters.
Here.

321
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,610
Married...
Look for the wife?

322
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,065
- They've been separated for two years.
- Well... find her.

323
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,695
She surely knows something.

324
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,245
Perhaps he has a girlfriend, a mistress...
Or did he stop?

325
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,867
Alright.

326
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,911
Get me Polvesi on the line.

327
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:13,667
No, I didn't know that my wife
hired a private detective.

328
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,465
Well, to tell you the truth...

329
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,800
I never had the time
to take care of my daughter.

330
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,550
Only last year I noticed
a strange, alarming change...

331
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:31,139
in the girl's personality.
She was usually so open-hearted and happy...

332
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,894
I then took her to Beltrame -
you know professor Beltrame, I imagine?

333
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,821
- Yes, by reputation. What did he say?
- Well, he calmed me down.

334
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,399
He said that this change
of personality...

335
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,700
is quite normal
for girls of that age.

336
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,155
I'm sorry, but I think
we'll have to pay him a visit.

337
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,993
Why? Do you think he might have
withheld something from me?

338
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,545
No. But we need
to pursue every detail.

339
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,793
Even the smallest one, to which
a year before nobody in the family...

340
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,218
attached much importance,
but maybe a doctor did.

341
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:05,390
No, I don't remember anything special.
And here?

342
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,594
I can't find anything else I noted down
apart from what I've already told you.

343
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,396
I can assure you
my overall impression was...

344
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:20,482
to be faced with an adolescent
who's very sensitive for her age.

345
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,034
- Maybe a little frustrated.
- Frustrated?

346
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,953
I'm not allowed to tell you anything more,
you must understand.

347
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,907
If you knew
how many girls of that age...

348
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,244
can cause their parents
great problems.

349
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,504
Take a look at this.

350
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,083
These are some other girls...

351
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:45,923
who might turn into tragic cases.

352
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,007
Thank you, professor.

353
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,685
Should it be necessary,
I will ask you for a formal statement...

354
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,309
and will free you
from certain professional restrictions.

355
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,357
Alright.
I'm at your service.

356
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,565
There she is.

357
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,029
I'll see you this afternoon.

358
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,535
- Mrs. Talenti, is this your husband?
- That was my husband.

359
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,707
- What do you want from me?
- We need to talk to you.

360
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,126
I don't want to hear
the name of that pig anymore.

361
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,750
- He's a private detective?
- Yes, the private detective...

362
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,797
Could you tell us,
where we can find him?

363
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,921
Me? How should I know?

364
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,548
- Ask his secretary.
- Who's that?

365
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,052
A whore.
Who goes to bed with him.

366
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,179
- And where is she?
- In hospital.

367
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,810
They had an accident.
Unfortunately, they're not dead.

368
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,140
Come on, let's go, Napoli.

369
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:42,194
Whoever this secretary might be,
she can only be better than that one.

370
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,942
Drive.

371
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,077
Did his wife send you?

372
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,407
- What do you want from me?
- We have to ask you a few questions.

373
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,085
We were told that Talenti
used to visit you quite often.

374
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,997
That's him, isn't it?

375
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,883
Is he?

376
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:09,672
When did you last see him?

377
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,802
What are you, a policewoman?

378
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,013
- I'm the assistant public prosecutor.
- Silvestri...

379
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,441
It's possible we've found the car
of that Talenti.

380
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,145
- Could you proceed?
- Of course.

381
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,110
So?

382
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,238
I haven't seen him
in two days.

383
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,867
That never happened before.
He hasn't even called.

384
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,967
According to the license plate
it belongs to Ruggero Talenti.

385
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,929
The car has been parking here
for two or three days - locked.

386
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,481
Come on, force the lock.

387
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,119
Open the trunk.

388
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,520
There we have the second body.

389
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,486
I'm sorry, but I have to ask you
a few questions.

390
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,031
May I continue?

391
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:54,327
Did Talenti ever tell you about
a new, important assignment?

392
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,576
Doesn't the name
Silvia Polvesi ring a bell?

393
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,831
Talk, Rosa. I have to know.
Have you ever felt threatened?

394
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,037
No, I don't know anything.

395
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,419
You work for Talenti,
you were also his secretary.

396
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:12,174
- So how can't you know anything?
- I haven't been to the office in months.

397
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,928
Ever since the accident.

398
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,389
You had three operations.

399
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:24,849
These operations were expensive.
How did Talenti pay for them?

400
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,311
Ruggero... was so good...

401
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,616
But he needed money, is that right?
A lot of money. And how did he get it?

402
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,290
You know it. Did he blackmail someone?
You know it, and you have to tell me.

403
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,038
He found something out
that made him money. A lot of money.

404
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,915
That's why they killed him
in that manner.

405
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,419
- What manner?
- It's enough, Silvestri.

406
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,627
The law forbids me
to say and ask you anything else.

407
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,632
Isn't that right, Mrs. public prosecutor?

408
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,681
The law only forbids you
to apply certain methods.

409
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,634
I'm positive she knows something.

410
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,436
Something that might help us
to find out...

411
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,516
who killed a girl
and murdered a man.

412
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,871
It's not important.

413
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,637
- The murder weapon?
- An axe or something like it.

414
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,059
He was probably still alive
when they started.

415
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,935
- What tells you this?
- Well, everything. Also the blood.

416
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,936
Maybe he tried to defend himself.

417
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,938
Are you ready for the identification?

418
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,487
Cover him up and let the wife in.

419
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,297
Mrs. Talenti,
do you recognise your husband?

420
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,716
We need your official identification.

421
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,296
- I want to see his body.
- That's not necessary. The face will suffice.

422
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,552
I want to see him.

423
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,634
I want to see
what they did to him.

424
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,644
Please...
I'd like to talk to the police.

425
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,813
<i>- That's not possible, Miss.</i>
- I know it's late.

426
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,483
But it's really important.
I'm begging you.

427
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,562
<i>As you wish.
One moment.</i>

428
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,231
Put her through.

429
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,193
Yes, it's me.
Tell me, what is it, Rosa?

430
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,369
Come over right now.

431
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:29,416
I think I kept something from you
that might be important.

432
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,786
Maybe also important for others.

433
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,543
And I'm afraid.

434
00:35:38,318 --> 00:35:39,552
Come right away, I'm begging you.

435
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,470
Of course I will.
Calm down now. I'll be right there.

436
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,570
Let's go, Napoli.

437
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,846
What is going on?
Aren't you feeling well?

438
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,308
Come on. Let's go.

439
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,393
To bed, yes?

440
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,320
What were you planning to do?

441
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,445
You could have called
if you needed something.

442
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,510
Now I will give you a nice injection,
then you can sleep soundly.

443
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,759
No, I don't want to...

444
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,274
Call me if you need something.

445
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,221
Now I will chop you to pieces.

446
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,306
Just like I did with your boyfriend.

447
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,394
But first you will tell me
where you hid the stuff.

448
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,914
After him, Napoli.

449
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,855
Take care of her.

450
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,458
Go.

451
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,059
Notify Giardina and send all cars
that are in this area.

452
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,766
I repeat, all available cars
to the city centre.

453
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,069
<i>He's driving towards
Old Station Square. Over.</i>

454
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:55,276
O Kappa: Car 3 and 7.
Drive to Old Station Square. Over.

455
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,362
<i>Car 3, driving towards
Old Station Square.</i>

456
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,118
<i>Car 7, we're on our way.</i>

457
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,577
We're now at Old Station Square.
We're closing in on him.

458
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,988
Giardina, he drove to Fountain Quarter.
Block the exit.

459
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,327
He's coming towards us.

460
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,655
There, I can see him.

461
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,594
I repeat:
Drive to the highway.

462
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,846
They're forcing him out of town.

463
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,094
- Are you there too, Giardina?
- Right behind you.

464
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,387
I could shoot him, that bastard.

465
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:43,092
Yes, great, good idea.
Then you'd go right to jail.

466
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,393
Better in jail than driving like this.

467
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,655
<i>We forced him onto the road
leading to the lake.</i>

468
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,534
- Try <i>to cut him</i> off
- O Kappa, inspector Silvestri.

469
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,868
At least two cars are driving
for support into this zone.

470
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,516
We're at the tunnel.
Did you set up a road block?

471
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,974
<i>Yes, inspector.
About half a mile ahead of you.</i>

472
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,919
Send all available patrols
to this spot.

473
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,464
Turn this area upside down
even if you sweat blood.

474
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,292
But find me that son of a bitch.

475
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,973
Can she talk, doctor?

476
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,105
Well, what didn't you tell us?

477
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,353
What did they want from you?

478
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,975
- Very good. So you were right.
- It's not important.

479
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,600
We cut the sections together...

480
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,353
in which the voices
are recognisable.

481
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,943
<i>Come in.</i>

482
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,022
<i>- It's open.</i>

483
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,860
<i>Hello, dear.
Let's have a look at you.</i>

484
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:36,037
<i>You know that you're very graceful?
Really.</i>

485
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,744
<i>I've waited for so long.</i>

486
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,378
<i>- Have you never been here before?
- No, it's the first time.</i>

487
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,418
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

488
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:50,722
<i>Don't just stand there so stiff.
Come here.</i>

489
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:55,143
<i>- I won't bite you...
- What do you want me to do?</i>

490
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,435
<i>You seem to be in a hurry.
Relax.</i>

491
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,188
<i>I am going to show you.</i>

492
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:05,361
<i>- But I have to go home.
- I know, I know.</i>

493
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:09,316
<i>You're just coming from school,
and they're waiting for you at home.</i>

494
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,526
<i>But I'm sure
you can think of a nice excuse...</i>

495
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,453
<i>for being
half an hour late.</i>

496
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,667
<i>Well, let's get started.
Take off your clothes.</i>

497
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,461
<i>Off with the smock.</i>

498
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,544
<i>Just like that.</i>

499
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,922
<i>And now... the blouse.</i>

500
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,506
<i>Good.</i>

501
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,716
<i>The skirt...</i>

502
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,300
<i>Come on...</i>

503
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,557
<i>What's the matter?</i>

504
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,184
<i>- You see, I...
- Come on...</i>

505
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,643
<i>Don't be afraid.
Wait...</i>

506
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:50,073
<i>I will take off
the knickers myself.</i>

507
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,575
<i>You're lovely. Lovely...</i>

508
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,536
<i>Walk a few steps.</i>

509
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,295
<i>You're the sweetest thing
in the whole world.</i>

510
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,964
<i>And now...</i>

511
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,168
<i>we'll get to know each other
a little better.</i>

512
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,091
<i>Here, you see?</i>

513
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,639
<i>Come on...</i>

514
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,181
<i>Sit down...</i>

515
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,600
<i>No... here.</i>

516
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,390
<i>Sit on my knees.
Like that...</i>

517
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,101
<i>Yes, just like that.</i>

518
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,152
<i>One leg there...</i>

519
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,026
<i>and the other one here.</i>

520
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,404
<i>That's it.</i>

521
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,582
These are two more voices
from another recording.

522
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,956
<i>What are you doing?</i>

523
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,663
<i>- Easy, you're tearing up my blouse.</i>

524
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,590
<i>Now take off your clothes.
Do it quick.</i>

525
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,669
<i>-What do I have to do now?
- Lay on the bed.</i>

526
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:57,007
<i>No, wait.
Put these two cushions under your legs.</i>

527
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,059
<i>But... what is this.
What is this thing?</i>

528
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,979
<i>Listen, less chatter, please.
I paid a lot of money...</i>

529
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,399
<i>and they told me, I could do what I want
with the girl they send me.</i>

530
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,147
<i>- So be quiet and let me do my thing.
- Quiet?</i>

531
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,980
<i>- But what is this?
- That thing that frightens you so much...</i>

532
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,533
<i>will give you a lot of pleasure.
You'll see.</i>

533
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,905
<i>- No, I don't want that.
- Now stop it. Come on...</i>

534
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,537
<i>- Yes... just like that...</i>

535
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,585
<i>- Yes. You like it.</i>

536
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,254
Well, did you find anything?

537
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,583
A tire print of the motorcycle
on soft ground.

538
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,466
- The plaster cast is with forensics.
- Good. And how's Napoli?

539
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,888
The poor chap,
they operated him.

540
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,057
Come in.

541
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,476
Here, inspector.
The cast turned out very well.

542
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,429
But the tire
is a very common type.

543
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,356
One thing's for sure:
It's from a motocross bike.

544
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,481
That's something.
Now it's your turn, Giardina. We got work to do.

545
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,814
Search for all stores
selling, producing or mounting this tire.

546
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,490
I want a complete list
of all persons...

547
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,738
who bought a bike like this
over the last three years.

548
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,995
- And the hatchet?
- Here it is.

549
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,288
No fingerprints, of course.

550
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,913
But it's a special type,
a cleaver for butchers.

551
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,210
<i>- Look, I...
- Sit on my knees.</i>

552
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,836
<i>Like that...</i>

553
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:17,387
<i>Yes, just like that.
One leg there...</i>

554
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,424
<i>and the other one here.</i>

555
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,758
<i>That's it.</i>

556
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,139
<i>Come here.
Let's have a look at you.</i>

557
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,939
<i>- It's not so bad, is it?
- Could we talk a little less...?</i>

558
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,766
- That's Silvia.
- <i>I don't have much time.</i>

559
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,444
That's my daughter.
But what's she doing on that recording?

560
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,989
- Silvia...
- What is this?

561
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,191
I know this is a painful matter.

562
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,367
Silvia was in a ring
of underage prostitutes...

563
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,037
for men of a certain age.

564
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,989
And not only your daughter.

565
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,247
On this recording
we have voices of six more girls.

566
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,704
- All of them very young.
- But Silvia is dead.

567
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,881
That's exactly
why we must save the others.

568
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,800
- Silvia was beautiful, happy...
- Let's talk about the phone calls.

569
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,933
I wanted to also talk with her mother
about the calls Silvia was getting.

570
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,434
But she told me to stay out of it.

571
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,357
Try to remember
something specific.

572
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,400
For example,
have you ever picked up the phone?

573
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,569
Silvia did everything she could
to keep me from doing so.

574
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,444
- But then suddenly something changed.
- In what way?

575
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,697
Recently she stopped
picking up the phone.

576
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,575
She had intense crying fits.

577
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:28,750
You see, I had the impression
that she's in love.

578
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:34,206
One day I spied on her
and frankly asked her if she was threatened.

579
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,420
She didn't tell me anything but she was
downright terrified and ran away.

580
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,596
- What day was that?
- Tuesday.

581
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,383
The day she was murdered.

582
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,014
Santelli, Zeno: Tramway employee,
Saccio, Annamaria: Student...

583
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,643
Melchiorri, Roberto: Butcher.
Wait a minute.

584
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:02,200
<i>Come in.
It's open.</i>

585
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,996
<i>- Good morning, my dear.</i>

586
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,792
The list of everyone
who recently bought a bike like that.

587
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,165
Look at the bottom.

588
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,044
A butcher, my God.
Have them track him down immediately.

589
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,750
No, you go personally, Giardina.

590
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,131
And please report in right away,
no matter what time it is.

591
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,467
<i>Let's have a look at you.</i>

592
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,472
<i>You know that
you're very graceful?</i>

593
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,742
- Chin up.
- The same goes for you.

594
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,005
I keep asking myself
why I chose this profession.

595
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,092
Although, this one or another,
it's always the same.

596
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,770
- You just have to believe in what you do.
- And you believe in it?

597
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:15,393
Of course.

598
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:19,227
Even if I sometimes have the feeling
that I do everything wrong.

599
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:24,316
That's probably only because
you got involved in a case like this one.

600
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,074
Probably.

601
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:39,255
Did you hear that, Silvestri?
What my colleagues say?

602
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,459
That a case like this
is too tough for a woman.

603
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,464
Because women are weak.

604
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:49,300
So you probably need muscles
to take care of a case like this.

605
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,098
- You think so too, don't you?
- I never said that.

606
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,682
After everything that happened,
you actually seem to have proven the opposite.

607
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,565
Thank you.
I had to get this off my chest.

608
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,402
Yes, Silvestri here.

609
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,782
- It's me.
- Go ahead.

610
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,035
<i>This might be a promising lead.
The butcher disappeared.</i>

611
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,411
<i>But I have a photo of him.</i>

612
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,163
<i>- Can you come to the office?
- Be right there.</i>

613
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:19,670
From his father.

614
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,998
He said his son left home
almost three months ago...

615
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,424
and he hasn't seen him
ever since.

616
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,550
- Which of these four is he?
- That one there.

617
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,015
At least we know
what he looks like.

618
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:40,058
Have a few enlargements made
and sent to all precincts.

619
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,734
Wait...

620
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,146
He doesn't know
we identified him.

621
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,816
Have them watch the butchery
and tap his phone instead.

622
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,323
Already done.

623
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,405
Pathology, send in Fasanelli.

624
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,542
<i>Come on, spread your legs.</i>

625
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:02,213
<i>- No, I don't want to.
- Well, now stop it... Come on...</i>

626
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,667
<i>- Yes, just like that...</i>

627
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,549
<i>- Yes. You like it.</i>

628
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,393
<i>Come in.
It's open.</i>

629
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,849
<i>Good morning, my dear.
You know that you're very graceful?</i>

630
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:25,483
<i>- Have you never been here before?
- No, it's the first time.</i>

631
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:30,867
<i>Don't be afraid.
Don't just stand there so stiff.</i>

632
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,742
<i>- Come here.
- What do you want me to do?</i>

633
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:39,246
<i>- You seem to be in a hurry.
- I have to go home.</i>

634
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,295
<i>- Yes, just like that...</i>

635
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,302
<i>- Yes. You like it.</i>

636
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,895
<i>Come in.
It's open.</i>

637
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,485
<i>Good morning, my dear.
You know that you're very graceful?</i>

638
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,969
LAST WARNING

639
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,162
Would you mind
coming up for a minute?

640
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,666
I'd like to talk to you.

641
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,667
- Did you find the letter yesterday?
- The letter?

642
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,968
- You put it there.
- It was delivered very late yesterday.

643
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,591
And not to disturb you,
I thought...

644
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,423
- I'd slip it under the door.
- Who brought it?

645
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,554
A young man.

646
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:24,575
The Polvesis... filthy rich, scatterbrained -
but no, it has to be someone like me.

647
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:28,377
Condemned to this rubbish job
for a few blasted lira.

648
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,956
And all that just for my daughter,
who's the light of my eyes.

649
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,588
But who are they?
What do they want? Why?

650
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:40,640
That's Patrizia.
That's the voice of my daughter.

651
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:46,017
That's my daughter on these recordings.
My daughter with these pigs.

652
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:50,976
Find me one of them, Silvestri.
I will kill him with my own hands.

653
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,158
But you need to help us.

654
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:04,080
Go and pick up Patrizia from school.
We'll talk together.

655
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,908
And try not to frighten her.

656
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,336
What's that?

657
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:24,638
- Not important anymore.
- An anonymous letter?

658
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,934
In the last one I got...

659
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,979
they threatened
to blow up the headquarters.

660
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,714
Come on.

661
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,550
The papers
won't leave us in peace.

662
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,302
The commissioner called
two minutes ago.

663
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,054
He said those in Rome
are already driving him mad.

664
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,853
And why don't they
search him themselves, those in Rome?

665
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,271
They only need
to show it on

666
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,521
- and the butcher will come on his own.
- TV, that's an idea.

667
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,445
Take this photo
and have them make an enlargement.

668
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,986
Hello.
Give me the commissioner.

669
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,246
Would you like a cigarette?

670
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,986
I asked for
a public announcement on

671
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,118
to support
the search for the killer.

672
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,457
I know, commissioner,
but I can't leave any stone unturned.

673
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,414
I'm sorry.
Did you hear?

674
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,216
TV suggests to show
the public announcement during a show...

675
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,761
on police work that will be broadcast
in two days. Understand?

676
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,713
They're doing us a "favour".

677
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,361
Listen, I forgot something.
Listen....

678
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,359
Are you mad?
Stop it

679
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:01,322
Everything's fine.
I'll take you to your apartment.

680
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,786
- Was it the same man?
- He only confirmed our assumptions.

681
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,714
- How's the public prosecutor?
- Is it true that she was raped?

682
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,134
Hey.
They're bringing the body of the driver.

683
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,184
<i>The deed prompted a manhunt
of unforeseen scale.</i>

684
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,764
<i>Not only the city but also the surrounding
regions are being combed by the police.</i>

685
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,145
<i>After the terrible crimes
of the last few days...</i>

686
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:16,197
<i>the assistant public prosecutor Vittoria Stori
was attacked last night...</i>

687
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,400
<i>when she returned
to her apartment.</i>

688
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,698
<i>The public prosecutor
was miraculously saved...</i>

689
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,952
<i>thanks to the intervention
of her building superintendent.</i>

690
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:31,628
<i>But the driver of her staff car
was unfortunately ferociously murdered.</i>

691
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:36,550
<i>Due to this clustering
of criminal incidents...</i>

692
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:40,379
<i>the police asks for
the collaboration of all citizens.</i>

693
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,514
<i>Reliable evidence
allows for the conclusion...</i>

694
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:48,311
<i>that the culprit
is a certain Roberto Melchiorri...</i>

695
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:51,936
<i>of whom we will now
show you a picture.</i>

696
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:55,018
<i>Every clue could be helpful
to the police.</i>

697
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:58,401
<i>You only have to call 112.</i>

698
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,243
Repeat everything you've told me.
Tell them how you came into this work.

699
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:11,167
But I...
I was only there one time.

700
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:15,042
On this tape is your voice
and that of a man, Patrizia.

701
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,374
Did you know him?

702
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,381
I had never seen him before.

703
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,508
And I haven't
seen him again afterwards.

704
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,513
- How were the appointments arranged?
- By phone.

705
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,139
BY whom?

706
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,186
I don't know.

707
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,145
Bigi told me
that somebody would call.

708
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,476
And who's that Bigi?

709
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:40,109
Giuliana, a classmate of mine.
You know her, father.

710
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,568
I've known her since she was little.
I never liked her much.

711
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,826
Who's Giuliana Bigi?

712
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,250
- That's me. Why?
- You'll have to come with us.

713
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,830
- What do you want from me?
- Come along.

714
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:00,467
Lucia, see you later at your place.

715
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:20,950
They also caught Bigi.

716
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,696
<i>- How do you know?</i>
- How do I know?

717
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,526
I'm standing in front of the school
and they just took her away.

718
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,531
<i>Does she know you?
Did she ever meet you in person?</i>

719
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,364
Of course not, never.
But the others have.

720
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,496
<i>Now don't get on my nerves
like that idiot.</i>

721
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,702
Yes, but excuse me,
if one of them spills the beans...

722
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,585
eventually someone will get it
and we all go to jail.

723
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,588
<i>What are you saying? The more are in on it,
the more relaxed we can be.</i>

724
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,715
<i>If Bigi tells them
all she did and with whom...</i>

725
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,387
<i>no one can get to us,
understand?</i>

726
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,339
- But I...
<i>- Enough.</i>

727
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,926
<i>You know there are people who'll protect us.
Don't leave town.</i>

728
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,888
<i>Trying to run is the only thing
that makes you suspicious.</i>

729
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,974
Yes, but it would be better to stop,
now this thing with Polvesi happened...

730
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,185
<i>Not at all.
You're foolish.</i>

731
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,488
<i>I decide whether we stop,
when and how.</i>

732
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,576
Damn you...

733
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:12,577
I didn't want to...

734
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,874
Calm down, Patrizia.

735
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,413
Take her home, Valentini.

736
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,481
<i>Excuse me, dear.
I'm a little late.</i>

737
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,908
<i>Your loss and your problem.</i>

738
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,781
<i>Now you'll have to settle
for half an hour.</i>

739
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:53,489
<i>What, half an hour?
I paid for one hour.</i>

740
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,244
<i>And I want to spend
one hour with you.</i>

741
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,541
<i>I don't care if you're late.</i>

742
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,211
<i>Just go
and complain to Bruno.</i>

743
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,508
Who is Bruno?

744
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,627
Well?

745
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,346
Such a fuss over
four times fucking...

746
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,050
I asked you who Bruno is.

747
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:17,388
I've never seen him,
he always calls.

748
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,190
You've never seen him?

749
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,143
- Never met him?
- Never.

750
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:27,777
He told me on the phone
where I have to go and when.

751
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,609
Do you know other girls
from the ring?

752
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:34,913
- No, nobody.
- And how did you get into it?

753
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,832
It was Bruno.
He called me every day.

754
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,787
He said, I could earn
a heap of money.

755
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:47,672
- So you do know him.
- No. I've never met him in person.

756
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,099
Who is it?

757
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,227
It's me, open up.

758
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,274
- Who?
- They arrested Bigi.

759
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,147
Open up, quick.

760
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,071
Be quiet.
Don't talk in the hall.

761
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,139
Car 4, are you there?

762
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,559
<i>- Yes he's wounded, loses lots of blood.
- The ambulance is coming.</i>

763
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:42,936
- Does <i>he have any papers?</i>
- Yes, a mail subscription. For Bruno Paglia.

764
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,605
<i>It's Bruno Paglia, inspector.
He was already arrested in the Polvesi case.</i>

765
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,986
- We know that. <i>Nothing else?</i>
<i>- Only that he was interrogated...</i>

766
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,613
<i>- and released again.</i>

767
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,537
If they tried to eliminate him,
he has to know something.

768
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:58,954
They're afraid he'll talk.

769
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,248
If you consider
that we already had him...

770
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,953
But the chief prosecutor,
the protocol, police ordinance...

771
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:07,755
- Step back, step back.
- What happened?

772
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,709
Please step back.

773
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,214
- Will he make it?
- I don't think so.

774
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,046
He was stabbed five times
in the stomach.

775
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,804
It would be a miracle
if he'd make it to the hospital.

776
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:31,571
- They messed him up badly, the poor man.
- Do something, doctor.

777
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,524
I do what I can,
but I can't perform miracles.

778
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,782
This man knows important things,
and he has to tell them to me, doctor.

779
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,456
At any cost, even if I have
to beat them out of him.

780
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,376
Did you call these girls?

781
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,832
- Answer.
- He's lost lots blood...

782
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,134
- and still does.
- But I have to interrogate him.

783
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,008
I can't allow that in his condition.
It's very serious.

784
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,760
Nobody cares
if that son of a bitch dies.

785
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,013
The only bad thing is
if he dies without talking.

786
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,845
Talk, for God's sake.

787
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,226
He's dead.

788
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,865
- Gentlemen, the case is solved.
- Solved, how?

789
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,287
Would you tell us how?

790
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,332
In a few hours I'll be able
to tell you names, all names.

791
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,750
The ones of the executors
as well as the masterminds.

792
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,750
They tried to get rid of a witness
and accomplice.

793
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,922
A certain Bruno Paglia.

794
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,629
He survived and is in hospital.
Nobody can get near him.

795
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,929
As soon as his condition allows...

796
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,883
he'll tell the chief prosecutor
everything he told me.

797
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,468
Please tell us something.

798
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,803
- Did he reveal a lot, that Paglia?
- Unfortunately...

799
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:49,061
I can't say anything
ahead of the official statement.

800
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,233
The case... is solved.

801
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,652
- Can we publish that?
- Yes, of course.

802
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:57,232
You said the case was solved.
That's outrageous.

803
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,908
Don't think about
dragging me into this.

804
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,827
I didn't want to drag
anybody into this.

805
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,871
You promised the press
to make a corpse talk.

806
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:07,371
I don't want anybody to know about
Paglia's death until noon.

807
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:12,001
I need to buy time until the papers
have published the false story.

808
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,710
Alright.
I got a lot of work on my table.

809
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,842
I'll delay the interrogation
of your corpse until noon.

810
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,388
That's all I want.

811
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,388
Someone's behind that whole story
who's now lost his head.

812
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,469
The murder of Bruno Paglia
proves this.

813
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,352
The papers have to make this someone
believe that the man has talked.

814
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:33,060
Silvestri, you're gambling
with your career.

815
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,318
Don't you think it's worth it?

816
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,443
POLVESI CASE:

817
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,496
THE NAMES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS

818
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,290
UNDERAGE CALL-GIRLS:

819
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,869
SENSATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
IN POLVESI CASE

820
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,170
BRUNO PAGLIA HAS TALKED

821
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,591
POLVESI CRIME:
SUDDEN TURN IN INVESTIGATION

822
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:15,815
You know very well that the fact
that Beltrame killed himself...

823
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,363
doesn't prove that
he was involved in this story.

824
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:21,191
Yes, of course.
That's why I asked you...

825
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,071
to authorise
a further investigation of the case.

826
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,950
I don't have a problem with that.

827
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,374
But don't forget
that we need crucial evidence.

828
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,578
I hope to deliver you some soon.

829
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,001
- So have you identified all of them?
- Everybody.

830
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,332
Except for that girl
who was there alone.

831
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,636
But that's exactly the one I want.
Find her and take her to the public prosecutor.

832
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,054
Let's go, Giardina.

833
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,434
- Where are we going?
- To that fine gentleman, Beltrame.

834
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,602
But he's dead.

835
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,475
Dead he'll tell us more
than when he was alive.

836
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,773
We still have to get rid of the nightmare
of that madman with the hatchet.

837
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,602
- Did anybody call?
- Dozens, it's a chaos.

838
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:24,906
- As usual, people saw everything everywhere.
- But nobody can say something specific...

839
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,200
You're Laura Bolero?

840
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,533
Why have you been
to professor Beltrame's funeral?

841
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,585
Since when do you know him?

842
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:44,216
I'm afraid.

843
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:48,547
- They will hurt me.
- And who are you afraid of?

844
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,682
They kept telling me
I mustn't say anything to anyone.

845
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:59,141
They... they will hurt me.

846
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,567
But there's no need
to be afraid, Laura.

847
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:05,864
Nobody can hurt you.
Because we will protect you.

848
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,363
You're completely innocent.
You're a minor.

849
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,616
Be brave, Laura, talk.

850
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,494
Where and when
did you meet professor Beltrame?

851
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,827
When did you visit him
the first time?

852
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,123
My mother took me.

853
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,714
Two years ago.

854
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,177
The professor was different
than the other doctors.

855
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,510
I trusted him.

856
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:41,608
He had me come to his office
several more times.

857
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,691
He said it's to continue
with the therapy.

858
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,481
He gave me pills.

859
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:52,660
Then...
I remembered nothing.

860
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,540
Sometimes...

861
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,997
Sometimes I fell asleep.

862
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:20,183
Then I realised
that he made me do things.

863
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,811
I didn't want to.

864
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,479
I didn't want to...
but I always felt so weak.

865
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,783
One time...

866
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,828
I noticed
that there was another girl.

867
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,209
About my age.

868
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,384
She started to scream.

869
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,007
I was so frightened.

870
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:00,429
One other time
the professor wasn't there.

871
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,981
There was another man.

872
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,150
With white hair.

873
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:10,237
He also gave me some pills.

874
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:15,694
And I had to do the same things...
as with the professor.

875
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,111
Take a look at this girl.

876
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:01,288
Did you see her that day
in Beltrame's office?

877
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,537
Have you ever seen her?

878
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,959
No, I've never seen here.

879
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,379
At least I don't think so.

880
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,835
But I was so confused
when I was there.

881
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,007
I couldn't swear it.

882
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,268
Search the office.

883
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,990
Take a look at this, Giardina.
It's all here. We don't need anything else.

884
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,163
Now we got names
for those voices.

885
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,617
- From the tapes?
- Of course.

886
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,670
It's unbelievable.
He wrote everything down.

887
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:05,432
It's terrible.
Beltrame was a monster.

888
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,186
Insane, perverse and impotent.

889
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,109
He corrupted that girl.

890
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,563
And probably many others.

891
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,988
He raped them.

892
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,908
Didn't you say
he was impotent?

893
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:25,035
He did it with a bottle.
A harrowing story.

894
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,208
He managed to get them to do
whatever he wanted.

895
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,206
Sometimes for free,
sometimes for money.

896
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:34,040
And sometimes he beat them bloody
until they lost consciousness.

897
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,466
And then came
the appointments.

898
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:39,011
A ring of old men
with horrible vices.

899
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,806
They're all in here.
With first names, surnames and addresses.

900
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,688
It's incredible,
he wrote it all down.

901
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,068
And here's a namesake...

902
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,816
He's the minister.

903
01:23:56,907 --> 01:24:00,946
He was a friend of Beltrame's.
He was also at the funeral.

904
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,403
The minister...

905
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,639
- Hello. Is this the police?</i>

906
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:35,852
Are you still looking for the man
they showed on TV yesterday evening?

907
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,438
<i>- Yes why? Have you seen him?</i>
- I just saw him.

908
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:41,149
- He went into a cellar.
- Are you quite sure?

909
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,733
Of course.

910
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,410
We are really sure.

911
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,158
- <i>He wore black leather things.</i>
- <i>And what's your name?</i>

912
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,832
- Marcia.
- <i>And where do you live?</i>

913
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,667
Piazza Matteotti.

914
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,961
Very well, Your Excellency.

915
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:59,967
I'll be in Rome the day after tomorrow
with a detailed report.

916
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,839
Don't worry.

917
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,679
Goodbye, Your Excellency.

918
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:12,013
Congratulations, Miss Stori.
A textbook example of an investigation.

919
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,849
And my compliments
also to you, inspector.

920
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:19,312
Mr. public prosecutor,
the evidence we have is... irrefutable.

921
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:22,615
But I seem to understand
that we can't prosecute the culprits.

922
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:26,490
Those who started the whole thing
and particularly those who picked the girls.

923
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:30,665
Ms. Stori, you understood that perfectly well.
Which I never doubted.

924
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,584
There are names among them
that are untouchable.

925
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,537
You can't get to them,
not without orders from the very top.

926
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:41,752
Which means never. As usual.
It's always the same old song.

927
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:44,212
First we're accused
of incompetency and inefficiency.

928
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,424
And when we've solved the case,
nothing happens.

929
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,848
Wrong.

930
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:54,146
There's still someone running around
who kills people with a hatchet.

931
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:58,359
Try to catch him,
and I will try to convince Rome...

932
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,061
to get to the bottom
of this case once more.

933
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,487
And I assure you that my task
is more difficult than yours.

934
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,399
What is it, Giardina?

935
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,155
Central received a call.

936
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:08,861
Maybe it's the right track.

937
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,035
Let's go.

938
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,867
- Did you know Bigi?
- Sure, she was at my school.

939
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,952
- Is it true that she was in that ring?
- What ring?

940
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:20,085
- Why do they want to interrogate us?
- How should I know?

941
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,469
We're at Piazza Matteotti,

942
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:10,173
All four access roads are blocked.
We're at Piazza Matteotti.

943
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:15,012
The four access roads are blocked.
We're awaiting orders.

944
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:28,532
Silvestri here.
Nobody may leave or enter the square.

945
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:31,155
I'll be right there.
Avoid the use of arms.

946
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:37,370
Get back.
Please, step back.

947
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:55,222
Don't shoot.
Give orders not to shoot.

948
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,061
- What have you got there?
- My resignation. I'm going.

949
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:27,313
Please wait a moment.

950
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,029
- Well, Mr. public prosecutor?
- I already told you, Silvestri.

951
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:33,653
You know it perfectly well.
Bringing everything to light...

952
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:36,110
- would take months.
- Mr. public prosecutor, we have the lists.

953
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,696
- The true culprits are on them.
- Come on, Silvestri...

954
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,157
you've captured the killer
and found the masterminds.

955
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,868
You managed to restore confidence
in the whole town.

956
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,919
What else do you want?
Blow it all up?

957
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,374
What are you saying?

958
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:58,014
I say go to hell.

959
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,263
I agree with that.

960
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:13,322
IN ITALY, 8,000 TEENAGERS DISAPPEAR
FROM THEIR HOMES EVERY YEAR.

961
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,527
ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE
EVER RETURN TO THEIR FAMILIES.

962
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:21,285
OTHERS ARE FOUND DEAD
OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS.

963
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:24,537
THE MAJORITY, HOWEVER,
DISAPPEAR WITHOUT A TRACE.
