1
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,260
If the story you
are about to see

2
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,601
were the product
of a writer’s imagination,

3
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:33,402
you might
label it unbelievable.

4
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,409
But these events
actually took place

5
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:38,036
on the streets and alleys
and the tenements

6
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:40,206
where we filmed them -

7
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:43,114
in the shadow
of the bridge.

8
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:57,449
[Dramatic music]

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,688
(Lawyer)
What did you do
after he fell down?

10
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:04,960
(Defendant)
I hit him.

11
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,932
(Lawyer)
What did you
have in your hand

12
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,266
when you hit him?

13
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,168
(Defendant)
A piece of wood.

14
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,298
(Lawyer)
And this piece of wood
you had in your hand,

15
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,401
what was on it?

16
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,980
(Defendant)
What do you mean?

17
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,810
(Lawyer)
On the end
of piece of wood,

18
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,408
what was there?

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,147
(Defendant)
I don't remember.

20
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:29,952
(Lawyer)
Please, speak up
so we can hear you.

21
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,458
(Defendant)
I don't remember.

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,585
(Lawyer)
What was your answer:
Please, let the court hear it.

23
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,390
Objection!

24
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:37,057
Are you trying to make
a fool of me?

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,066
Your honor, I cannot
complete my examination

26
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,499
if this idiot goes
on interrupting...

27
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,797
That is not
a proper remark

28
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,337
in reference
to counsel.

29
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,736
(Judge pounds gavel)
Gentlemen.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,434
Your remarks are discourteous
not only to one another

31
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,408
but to this court
as well.

32
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,036
I realize everyone
is very tired.

33
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:54,583
Let's just confine ourselves
to questions and answers.

34
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,413
Get away from me!
Don't lay a hand on me.

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,420
Your honor, this man
wants to assault me.

36
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,012
Your honor,
I did not assault him.

37
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,249
Take the defendants
out of here.

38
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,087
I demand police protection
from the prosecution.

39
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:06,593
This court will
be in order at once!

40
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,595
This trial stands adjourned
until 4 o’clock

41
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,187
the jury
will be advised...

42
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,426
Judge...

43
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:13,593
May I have
just a moment?

44
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:14,896
Get that
man out of here!

45
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:16,835
...can I just
say something...

46
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,602
(Policemen)
...Get him out,
get him out...

47
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:28,179
What did I do?

48
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:29,444
All right,
stand there.

49
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:31,383
Lean forward and put your
hands up against the wall

50
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:32,886
and freeze there.

51
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,182
Where's
the weapon?

52
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,190
Weapon?

53
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,190
It's a Bible.

54
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:38,419
Maybe there's
a gun in it.

55
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,017
Who do you work for,
the gangs?

56
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,596
Ahh, it's just a Bible,
where's the gun?

57
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:43,426
I don't
have a gun.

58
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:44,863
I'm a minister.

59
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,332
Those are my
ordination papers.

60
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,096
You always carry ordination
papers with you?

61
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,671
What are you
tryin' a hide?

62
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,605
David Wilkerson.
That your name?

63
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,005
Yes.

64
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,337
What are you
doing here?

65
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,708
I'm trying to get
permission from the judge

66
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,075
to help those kids.

67
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,580
With what,
new evidence?

68
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:03,151
All right, stand up, now.
Watch him.

69
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:05,812
I'll go see what the judge
wants to do about him.

70
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:09,823
How do you think
you can help those kids?

71
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,790
I've got a whole church full
of people praying for them

72
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:13,361
back in Philipsburg,
Pennsylvania.

73
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,453
[Laughter]
They better be praying
for a miracle

74
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:19,125
because the D.A. will
burn those creeps.

75
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,601
(Policeman)
Give him back
his Bible.

76
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,401
Alright, the judge said
he won’t press any charges

77
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,998
if you agree not
to come back here anymore.

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,600
Now what do you say?

79
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,411
What the hell.

80
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,916
These kids aren't
of your faith.

81
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,816
(Reporter)
Hey, reverend, what's that book
you got in your hand?

82
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,048
The Bible?

83
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,282
You ashamed
of it?

84
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,188
Of course not.

85
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,727
Stop hiding it then.
Hold it up where we can see it.

86
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:03,411
(Court personnel)
...All rise, hear ye,
hear ye, hear ye...

87
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:22,422
What can you do,
what can you say?

88
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:31,929
Where do you start
to begin, begin

89
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:44,915
you gotta face the fact that
you're just one guy,

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:59,094
but, on the other hand
the fact is you've got to try.

91
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,044
There's a dude sleeping
in the backseat.

92
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,019
I dig.

93
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:22,613
What if he
wakes up?

94
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,692
He look bad?

95
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,090
He don't look
too bad -

96
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:28,527
but, he don't look
too good either.

97
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,995
You chokin' up,
baby?

98
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,726
How we goin'
about this?

99
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:32,994
Now look.

100
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,868
When he comes out of the car,
you grab him like this.

101
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:39,406
You hold on to him
and I'll grab his wallet.

102
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:40,770
You like that?

103
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,208
Yeah.
That's nice.

104
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:47,271
Okay, when he come out,
we just get on him, dig?

105
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:35,288
Get his wallet.
Watch out! He's fast.

106
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:36,625
Hey, Bottlecap,
cool it.

107
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,597
Turn loose
that cat.

108
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,067
You're the cat from
the trial, ain't ya?

109
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,071
Yes.

110
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,664
Lay it on me, baby.

111
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,767
Don't wrestle with me.
Just lay in the sky.

112
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:52,642
That's it.
Look here.

113
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,080
This is the cat that went
after the judge in the
Egyptian king trial.

114
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:55,980
Right, baby?

115
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,676
Well, in away
I went after him.

116
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,117
I'm David Wilkerson.

117
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,587
Little Bo-peep, Davey baby.
You can call me 'Bo',

118
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,157
and the dude that tried
to slice ya,

119
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:04,816
that's my man
'Bottlecap.'

120
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,224
Hi, Bottlecap.

121
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,528
Hey, you niggers.
Bring that junk back here!

122
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:17,697
Come on! You want me
to whale tail on you?

123
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:19,831
You fools coppin;
From my man.

124
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,943
Get yourselves
together.

125
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:31,042
That's a real fine pair
o' shoes you got there.

126
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:35,453
Sure wish I had me a fine
pair o' shoes like that.

127
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,254
Thanks.

128
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:42,421
Hey do you know that gang,
the Egyptian Kings?

129
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,159
Yeah, they pretty bad,
but they ain't the heaviest.

130
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:48,236
Like they wouldn’t mess with
the Mau Maus or the Bishops.

131
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:50,237
I took these shoes
off of a wino.

132
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,569
He must a had athlete's
feet or something,

133
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:55,006
'cause I'm always itching.

134
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,600
Mau Maus, huh?

135
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:58,839
Sure would like
to meet them.

136
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,107
Is that
you're gang?

137
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,615
What I need a gang for?
I run alone.

138
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,208
I got no use
for jitterbuggin,

139
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:06,344
and getting messed up
and cuttin' cats.

140
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,922
Ain't no bread in it.

141
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:12,426
Bo, do you
believe in God?

142
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:14,689
I don't worry
about him.

143
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:17,458
I just worry about
the pigs and hustlin' bread.

144
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:20,558
Easy for you
to talk about God...

145
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,763
A rich man like you
with that bad car

146
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:28,104
and those
fine shoes.

147
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,179
God worries
about you.

148
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,941
You're on his
mind right now.

149
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:34,743
You better tell him
to think a little harder,

150
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,444
'cause he ain't
comin' through.

151
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,430
What's the gag?

152
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,762
You keep belly achin'
about shoes, put 'em on.

153
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,132
I don't want your
stinking shoes, man.

154
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:59,105
Don't make a thing of it.
Just put them on.

155
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,105
What you
gonna wear?

156
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,402
I've got another
pair at home.

157
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,704
Where’s that?

158
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,676
Philipsburg,
Pennsylvania.

159
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,715
Oh, beautiful, baby.
Give me five.

160
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,512
So you want to see the gang.
I'll show you the gang.

161
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,587
Let's get this chariot
together, Davey baby.

162
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:15,179
I'll take you to see
some real boppers.

163
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,315
Only don’t go laying none
of that God stuff on them

164
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,394
cause they'll cut you
so full of holes

165
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,155
that you could sprinkle
the grass

166
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,060
in which-em-a-call-it,
Pennsylvania,

167
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,292
just by drinking
a glass of water.

168
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:48,449
This turf belongs
to the A.A.A.G.P.

169
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,617
They got a peace treaty with
the Bishops and the Mau Maus.

170
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:54,753
They don't rumble anyhow,
they just freak out.

171
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,024
What's
the A.A.A.G.P.?

172
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:02,035
That's the American Association
for the Advancement
of Gangs and Pot!

173
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,777
You better
park here.

174
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,675
This is about as close
as you're going to get

175
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,577
and still keep
your car.

176
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,698
I think you’re gonna
wish you still had your shoes.

177
00:11:38,206 --> 00:12:46,905
Music

178
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,771
it’s water.

179
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,572
We were lucky.

180
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:59,018
Hey, Angela!
Angie, it's me Bo.

181
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,329
Hello,
where you been?

182
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,367
I haven't seen you around
in along time.

183
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,492
You don't
know him.

184
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,264
You just seen his picture
in the paper.

185
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:19,966
This is the preacher that
got himself busted
at the Egyptian Kings trial.

186
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,633
Oh...

187
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:24,473
(Bo)
Leave him alone.
That's his thing.

188
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,412
And don't go tryin' to turn
a trick on him.

189
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,416
He popped that same smile
on me an' Bottlecap.

190
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,282
Hey, he wants to meet
the gang.

191
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,048
Why don't you
take him inside?

192
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,145
I can't.

193
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:37,725
The Mau Maus waitin' for a war
council with the Bishops.

194
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:38,918
My brother's inside.

195
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,654
That's all right, Bo,
we'll go in.

196
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:43,697
Oh, now wait a minute.
Maybe it's better if I don't.

197
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,061
Like I said,
I'm loner.

198
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,761
I just run dispatches
for one gang or another,

199
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,734
but if I was to just walk
right in the clubhouse,

200
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,305
they might not
like it.

201
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:53,704
You're just afraid
they might cut you.

202
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:54,935
Oh, go on.
Take him in.

203
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,639
Uh huh. I ain't gonna
get bawled out-

204
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:02,615
unless you give me
five dollars.

205
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,515
Go on, you can turn him loose
just inside the door.

206
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,680
Five dollars
is my price.

207
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,294
Let's cool it,
Davey baby.

208
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,489
Five bucks is this
chick's top price.

209
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:18,361
For that you get two
joints of marijuana,

210
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,900
her body,
and two bits change.

211
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,971
Should I give her
some money?

212
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,506
Two bucks tops.

213
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,236
You better
make it three.

214
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,278
You don't wanna
insult her pride.

215
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:38,349
That cat could
only swing two.

216
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,756
Come on.

217
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,883
Later,
Davey baby.

218
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,426
I'm gonna go steal
me some breakfast.

219
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,655
All right, Bo.
Thanks.

220
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,440
Hey, Rosa
can I come in?

221
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,840
Your brother
wouldn't think so.

222
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,139
I brought
a friend.

223
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,180
Hey man.

224
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,487
The tennis club
is down the block.

225
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:21,619
You're stumblin'
around in my turf.

226
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,594
He's okay,
chance.

227
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,062
He's the preacher they
dragged out and beat up

228
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:26,224
for trying to help
the Egyptian Kings.

229
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,926
Yeah?

230
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,163
That's cool,
cool, man.

231
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,137
Smoke my peace pipe?

232
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,903
I will.

233
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:38,309
Have my
peace pipe.

234
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:39,937
Have a piece
of my pipe.

235
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,879
Have a...

236
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:45,379
What are you doing
with that joint?

237
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,387
I like it.
It makes me feel sexy.

238
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,923
Do you want me to embarrass
you by slapping your face?

239
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,549
Will you quit acting
like you own me!

240
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,390
Get out of here.

241
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,793
Hey, man,
don't walk on that grass.

242
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:57,330
That's genuine
Kentucky Blue.

243
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,626
Go home!

244
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,394
I wanna stay!
I want to be a deb.

245
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,527
I keep telling you that
I want to be a deb!

246
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:06,334
Look
look at 'em.

247
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,567
You want to be
like them?

248
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,143
You want to do what
they're doing?

249
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:10,472
I gotta start
doing it sometime,

250
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,546
why can't I start
doing it now?

251
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,341
Tell the man
we have arrived.

252
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:23,584
We are the chosen people.
We are the Bishops.

253
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:47,942
Big Cat's the name,
and jitterbuggin's my game.

254
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,382
Now let's get this
thing together, ace-

255
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:54,683
time and place.

256
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:59,192
Okay, Mr. Cool.

257
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:03,390
Mr. Cool.
I like that.

258
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,702
Israel,

259
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:14,901
President,
and I say the park.

260
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,312
The turf under dispute-
symbolic to boot.

261
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,213
Monday.

262
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,186
It'll be at eight, baby.
Don't be late.

263
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:29,381
Not at night man.

264
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,254
You can't see these
cats at night.

265
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,657
My man, the War Lord,
Abdullah,

266
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,855
he say the night
time's no good.

267
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,558
Too many pigs
out at night.

268
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,601
High noon then so that
the schools ain't out.

269
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:44,137
Yeah, right on, cat,
I like that.

270
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,366
If the pigs come,
then we join forces

271
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,169
and fight 'em together,
you dig it?

272
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,675
Agreed.

273
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,609
What weapons?

274
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:55,046
My War Lord,
Abdullah.

275
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,380
Make it light
on yourself.

276
00:17:57,485 --> 00:18:02,821
My War Lord,
Nicky.

277
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:16,567
Zips, blades, straights,
chains, clubs. Anything goes.

278
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:19,435
That's the way
we like it too.

279
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,805
Wait a minute.
No zips.

280
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,003
The cops don't like shooting.
Even from a homemade job.

281
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:25,306
You chicken?

282
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:27,040
You go one-on-one
with me

283
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,912
and you'll find out
who's chicken, fat lip!

284
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:30,985
Oh, wait
a minute now.

285
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,417
You gonna insult
my War Lord

286
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,420
we gonna get this
thing on right now.

287
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,491
[Brief argument]

288
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:38,923
Cool it man.

289
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,190
I told you you
could use the place
but leave it standing, dig?

290
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,731
Okay. No zips.

291
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,733
No guns at all.

292
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,429
We just use blades,
chains and baseball bats.

293
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:53,974
[Laughing]
Blades, chains
and baseball bats...

294
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:57,567
Can I... can I
say something?

295
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,274
Well, I don't know,
dude, can you?

296
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:05,318
L... uh... I just want to say
that there's somebody

297
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,786
who cares
about you people.

298
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:11,052
He cares about you
very much...

299
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,184
In fact, he loves you
just like you are.

300
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:15,819
Keep talkin'
about me, baby.

301
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,663
He knows about
the drinking, marijuana...

302
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:24,704
[Laughing]
La cucaracha...

303
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:30,335
He knows what you're looking
for when you play with sex.

304
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:34,108
We're looking
to make love, not war.

305
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,740
(Big Cat)
All right, all right,
everybody quiet, now.

306
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,376
Okay, dude,
you go ahead and rap.

307
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:44,390
Anybody give you steam,
I'll pound 'em into cream.

308
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:47,791
He wants you to have what
you're looking for.

309
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,727
Groovy.
Where's his turf?

310
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,093
What she mean,
dude,

311
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,531
the big man in the sky
eludes the naked eye.

312
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,535
He is dere,
but where?

313
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:58,037
You guys talk
about gettin' high.

314
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,903
God'll get ya high.

315
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,806
But he won't
let you down.

316
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,438
What God you talkin'
about - Allah

317
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:07,879
tell me, preach.

318
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:10,280
This God of yours,
does he rumble?

319
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:13,718
Yeah, yeah,
he rumbles.

320
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,584
He's fighting for you
right now.

321
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,715
Whose side
is he fightin' on?

322
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,053
Is he with the Bishops?

323
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,891
Or is he with
the Mau Maus?

324
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:25,693
He's with
both of you.

325
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,825
That's why I'm here.
God sent me.

326
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,472
Look I'm scared.

327
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:34,906
I know you guys
could kill me.

328
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,874
That's why I know
God's on your side

329
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:40,846
because he's making
me do what I'm doing.

330
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:47,479
Big Cat, Mr. President,
I'd like to shake your hand.

331
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:08,970
Nicky, Mr. War Lord,
how 'bout it.

332
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,655
I've got one thing
to say to you,

333
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,628
God loves you.

334
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:34,863
Oh yeah,
now I dig it.

335
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:37,403
You dragged this dude
in here to pacify us.

336
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,632
You thought maybe you
was goin' change our minds.

337
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,141
The only thing we gonna
change is your lip...

338
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:44,404
We gonna push
it up into your nose!

339
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,642
[Brief argument]

340
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,153
Alright, alright, it's bats,
blades and chains...

341
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:55,313
And when all your worstest
plans are made,

342
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:57,983
you best sign up
for medicaid!

343
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,754
You better forget
about medicaid

344
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,889
and start saving
for your tomb!

345
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,194
[Brief argument]

346
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:18,338
This God of yours preach,
is he on my side, too?

347
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:25,651
What's he gonna
do for me?

348
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:28,881
I'm a mainliner.

349
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,792
You know, the hard stuff,
heroin -

350
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:38,229
a whole mountain
of snow white.

351
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,360
That's heaven.

352
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,603
You just don't know what
heaven's like, preach.

353
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:53,977
What da ya got
for me, huh?

354
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:58,109
I don't have any
magic cure.

355
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:03,350
Then what did ya
come here for?

356
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:25,942
Where is your good life
nobody knows . Do, do, do...

357
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,538
Did they dig ya,
Davey baby?

358
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:43,758
You say that love
will change the world someday,

359
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:53,740
how come it doesn’t
happen right away?

360
00:23:53,841 --> 00:24:03,739
Where is the magic?
I like to see.

361
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:08,151
Where is your
good life,

362
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:11,692
aren't you coming on
strong with me?

363
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:13,021
Hey,
look at this!

364
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,652
Can you play
with that?

365
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,025
Sure I can
swing with it.

366
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,428
I used to play
in the Y.M.C.A.

367
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,933
Drum and Bugle Corps-
'till they kicked me out.

368
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:22,730
Why'd they kick
ya out?

369
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,136
They found out
I was a girl.

370
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,370
Bo...

371
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:02,267
[Singing in the background]

372
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,867
Wait a minute.

373
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,776
Is that a church?

374
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:49,720
[Singing]

375
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,190
You are David!

376
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,289
We have all been
praying for you!

377
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,263
You have?

378
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:01,301
This is the preacher
in the newspaper.

379
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:02,733
This is
David Wilkerson.

380
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:05,271
I am Hector Gomez.
I am pastor here.

381
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:08,433
We have been practicing
for the service.

382
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:12,172
And this is my wife,
Graziella.

383
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,617
This is Isaac, Ruth,
Israel, Samuel.

384
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:24,282
Oh go on,
shake his hand.

385
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:27,850
Hello...

386
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,557
So, where are
you staying?

387
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,531
Well... it took
all the bread money

388
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,693
in my congregation
to get me here.

389
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,998
The cat sleeps
in his car.

390
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,333
Oh no, you
mustn't do that.

391
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,600
That's very
dangerous.

392
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:44,007
You must come and stay
with us, Mr. Wilkerson.

393
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:49,981
Oh no, I... although it would be
awfully nice on my back

394
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:52,814
be nice to be near a phone too,
I'm having a baby.

395
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,945
My wife’s
having a baby.

396
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:57,388
[Laughter]

397
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,983
So while you are living in
the city, this is your home.

398
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,289
Thank you.

399
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:03,420
Where do you live?

400
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:05,658
Oh, he's got his car
parked in my parlor.

401
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,927
You don't
have a home.

402
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,468
Yeah,
I got a home.

403
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,299
And I got ten
brothers and sisters.

404
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,872
Better in the streets.

405
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,204
More room and a lot
more quieter.

406
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,403
So you will live
with us, too.

407
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,946
What is it?

408
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:25,883
What miracle brings
such a fine young man

409
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,750
to our troubled streets?

410
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,755
Miracle?

411
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:33,088
I was beginning to think
it was pure insanity.

412
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,957
But you people,

413
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:40,261
you make me feel that maybe
it was... something good.

Nicky?

426
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,817
Yeah, yeah,
it's us.

427
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,587
It's back here.

428
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:18,859
How did it go?

429
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:20,228
Great. For us
it went great!

430
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,528
We burned
'em good.

431
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:22,465
Did you get hurt?

432
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,797
Nahh-we're
doing great.

433
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:24,928
We don't
get hurt, baby.

434
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,097
We hurt them.

435
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,298
Hey, anybody
else been here?

436
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:28,204
Just Mingo.

437
00:34:28,308 --> 00:34:30,071
The Cheer Leader.

438
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:31,769
Will the others
be coming soon?

439
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,937
If they make it.

440
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:33,945
You got your watch?

441
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:34,707
Yeah.

442
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:35,804
Okay. Listen.

443
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,577
You give 'em one
more hour, see?

444
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:38,514
No more.

445
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,916
Anybody comes
in that time,

446
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,386
you give 'em their rags and tell
'em where the new hideout is.

447
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,513
Okay, I dig.

448
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,491
When the hour's up, you stash
the rest of the rags and split.

449
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,185
Okay.

what do you think
you're doing?

452
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:27,591
I'm going
to preach.

453
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:30,261
You're not preaching here.
We got enough trouble.

454
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,304
Okay, everybody.
The circus is over.

455
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:34,169
You can all go
home now. Go on.

456
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:36,367
Officer, don't I have
a constitutional right

457
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,604
to speak on any street
corner in America?

458
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:41,203
Only under
an American flag.

459
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,873
Okay, you people
move on.

460
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,245
You're blocking
traffic.

461
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,477
Come on now.

462
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,554
Does anybody
have an American flag?

463
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:49,815
I can't speak
without a flag.

464
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:52,255
You get outta here, buddy,
or I'll run you in.

[People booing]

466
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,923

[People cheering]

468
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:03,770
That's no flag.

469
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,236
You can't speak
under that.

470
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,829
What do you mean
that ain't a flag?

471
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,998
What is it then?

472
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,939
That's a toy.
Get down from there.

473
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,237
What's going on?

474
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:12,676
Oh hello Sergeant.

475
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,371
This fellow is trying
to make a speech

476
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:17,314
and he's pawning off
that toy as a flag.

477
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,748
What's
your pitch?

478
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:21,412
I just want to tell these people
that somebody loves them.

479
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:24,184
That'll be a novel
experience for them.

480
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,728
But that's no flag -
that's a toy!

481
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:30,854
That looks like
a flag to me.

482
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,761
Go ahead.
You talk to them.

483
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:33,958
Thank you.

I'm just a country preacher,
300 miles from home.

486
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,470
But I've got
a message for you.

487
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,378
Hey! I've got
a message for you!

490
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,355
Is there anything in your
life you'd like you change?

491
00:36:56,456 --> 00:37:01,086
Yeah! Yeah, I'd like to make
the rich poor and me rich!

492
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:04,824
We got no love,
we got no bread.

493
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,958
We try to call out
but the line was dead.

494
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:09,695
Look at that.

495
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:14,137
Hey, man.
That's their president.

496
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:16,675
And he's
all alone.

497
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:21,347
Cool it, man.
Look.

(Big Cat)
What's the matter, preach,
you forget your lines?

499
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:31,947
[Laughter]

500
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:38,589
I don't know much
of what's goin' on around here.

501
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,157
But I do know that some
of you are so blind

502
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:45,830
that you're heading for a ditch
and you don't even know it.

503
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,874
I've seen you walk around
like you own the world.

504
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:52,139
You don't even know how much
danger you're really in.

505
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:55,238
Now you can't live too long
around here on luck.

506
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,716
Because somebody could
put a knife in your back
in the next minute.

507
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:03,483
In fact, for some of you time
may be running out right now.

508
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,421
The Bible says

509
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:08,824
"how can you escape if
you neglect your soul?"

510
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:11,159
Now that's one thing
you can't run away from.

511
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:12,061
Come on.
Let's go.

512
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,154
No, wait
a second.

513
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:16,668
...I can see the hate sticking
out of your eyes - some of you.

514
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,738
I don't know who
put it there,

515
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,502
but I do know who
can take it out.

516

like a big man,

517
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,336
but it's all
a front.

518
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:29,415
I can see right
through ya.

519
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,813
Will you
come on?

520
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,043
You wanna go?
Go.

521
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:34,245
I wanna listen
a minute.

522
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:38,415
You pretend you don't want
anybody to touch you.

523
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,756
But inside you're
crying out for love.

524
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:45,559
Now I know there's some pretty
tough guys in this crowd.

525
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,759
You wouldn't be afraid
to shake hands

526
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,530
with a skinny preacher,
would ya?

527
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:56,804
Will you,
big cat?

528
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,883
What do you
want me to do, man?

529
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:07,613
Pray with me.

530
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,586
Pray with me right now
that the Holy Spirit

531
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,454
will come into your heart
and make you a new man.

532
00:39:17,931 --> 00:39:19,421
I ain't
ready, man.

533
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:25,202
Hey, don't let it
bug ya.

534
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:29,503
You're coming
through.

535
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:46,416
[Spits]

536
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:49,893
[Crowd in awe]

537
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:53,397
God loves
you, Nicky.

538
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,094
You come near me
and I'll kill you.

539
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:59,832
Yeah,
you can do that.

540
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,135
You could cut me up into
a thousand pieces

541
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:04,767
and lay 'em in
the street...

542
00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:07,779
And every piece will
still love you.

543
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:24,924
Sergeant Delano.
Am I glad to meet you.

544
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:46,418
Burn 'em...
Did we ever burn 'em.

545
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,579
You should have seen 'em
when they hit the trees.

546
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:50,747
They were tumbling over
the wires and knocking

547
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,552
each other down
like ten-pins.

548
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,854
And then when they
trapped us in the alley

549
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:57,054
and they were blasting
us with fire-bombs.

550
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,495
I picked up this
garbage can, see.

551
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:00,725
And I was running up the fire
escape with the bricks...

552
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:06,795
Hey, Nicky, hey,
I thought you got busted.

553
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:10,741
I didn't see you get
outta the alley.

554
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:14,405
Next time look over your
shoulder when you run.

555
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,311
Hey, man,
you're kidding, right?

556
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,407
I fought out there
like a maniac.

557
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,749
I don't see
a scratch on ya.

558
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,220
Oh, you're
kidding, man.

559
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:26,087
Look at this.
Look, look at that.

560
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,127
You got that falling
over a garbage can.

561
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:29,820
Are you calling
me a liar?

562
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,798
I'm calling you
a liar and a chicken!

563
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,959
Line up.

564
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:39,334
Come on, get off your butts.
Let's go. Come on.

565
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:43,170
Come on.
Let's go.

566
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:46,473
Get your belts
and leave room to swing.

567
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,512
Nicky, honest.

568
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:49,013
Now you gonna
run through,

569
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,777
or do I have to come
over there and drag you?

570
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,353
You holdin'
an election?

571
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:55,512
Mingo
was chicken.

572
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:56,816
Israel, I swear.

573
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:59,949
I fought the biggest,
blackest jigs you ever saw-

574
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,618
three of 'em...

575
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,322
With bats and bayonets.

576
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,961
What are you trying
to do behind my back?

577
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:08,966
Make an ass
out of me?

578
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,036
You done that
pretty good already.

579
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:10,727
When?

580
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:11,963
Hangin' around
that phony preacher!

581
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,004
Keep your
voice down.

582
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:14,801
Did you get down on your
knees and sing hallelujah!

583
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:15,840
We rapped
for awhile.

584
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:17,034
About what?

585
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,838
How to bring all your
lost sheep into the fold!

586
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,173
Why do you
let that guy bug you?

587
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,247
Because
I hate him!

588
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:23,873
He's just a nice guy with a lot
of guts trying to help people.

589
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:25,383
He wants to break up
the gang!

590
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:27,680
What the hell do you think
he's in the neighborhood for?

591
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:28,913
- To be our chaplain!

592
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:31,456
He wants to bust us!

593
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:49,368
What's the
matter with me!?

594
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:53,003
Why does he have
to pick on me?

595
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,707
Because you're
the worst,

596
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:58,909
craziest bastard
there is.

597
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:05,083
If he can reach you,
he can reach anybody.

598
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:22,064
No!

599
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:59,978
[Dramatic music]

600
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,574
[Ahhhhhh...]

601
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:12,113
[Screams]

602
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:14,887
Somebody get
an ambulance!

603
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:19,764
Who won?

604
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:20,833
What?

605
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:24,233
Who gets the park?

606
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:27,329
I don't know.

607
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:42,017
[Dreaming]
Mingo... Mingo...
Mingo was chicken... ahhh...

608
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:55,393
[Knock at the door]

609
00:44:55,502 --> 00:45:00,166
Who's there?

610
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:03,765
[Knocking continues]

611
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:34,367
Hi, Nick.
Can I come in?

612
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:41,277
You gotta
be kidding!

613
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:43,474
I just had
to come by

614
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,381
and try to make you understand
that God loves you.

615
00:45:46,486 --> 00:45:49,853
You woke me
up to tell me that?

616
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,584
Can we
talk awhile?

617
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:54,387
Listen,
you crazy witch.

618
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:57,725
I told you to
stay away from me.

619
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:59,560
I didn't think
you really meant that.

620
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,566
Tell me
what I meant!

621
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:03,033
I'll kill you!

622
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:06,230
I'm not afraid
of you Nicky.

623
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:07,966
You better be...

624
00:46:08,074 --> 00:46:10,736
You talk tough,

625
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:14,575
but inside you're just like
all the rest of us;

626
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:17,172
you're scared.

627
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:21,185
There are a lot of guys
with scars from Nicky

628
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:23,118
that know
different.

629
00:46:23,223 --> 00:46:25,521
Aren't you sick
of hating people?

630
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:28,753
I like
to hurt people.

631
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:31,387
Aren't you
lonely, Nick?

632
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:37,596
You...

633
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:39,171
Damn you!

634
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:50,808
Love is only a word to me
a word you use

635
00:46:50,917 --> 00:47:00,849
when you're not to sure
of what to say...

636
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,554
Don’t sit down.
I'm meeting someone.

637
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,494
Oh, Norma?

638
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:09,967
Well I'll just sit here till
she comes, then I'll split.

639
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:19,704
How’d the rumble go,
huh?

640
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:23,112
Great.

641
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,549
And how
have you been?

642
00:47:26,653 --> 00:47:30,555
Great.
I been just great.

643
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:33,490
Do you think you could
let me have some money?

644
00:47:33,593 --> 00:47:34,491
Ten bucks.

645
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:36,357
Come on, baby.

646
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:38,896
It’s not for stuff.
It’s for food.

647
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:41,899
Order a soda.
I'll pay for it.

648
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,992
Don’t tease me,
Nicky.

649
00:47:44,103 --> 00:47:45,730
Then don't try to kid
the kidder, baby.

650
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,466
I can see that
look in your eyes.

651
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,873
You're sweating
out you next fix.

652
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:55,277
Ten bucks.

653
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:57,906
Trust me, Nicky.
Just until tomorrow.

654
00:47:58,017 --> 00:48:00,508
I wouldn't trust
you till yesterday.

655
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:11,596
Remember when you used
to do everything for me?

656
00:48:11,698 --> 00:48:15,099
I got a secret.

657
00:48:15,201 --> 00:48:19,968
I know a deb is supposed
to belong to the whole gang

658
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:27,377
but I only really ever
belonged to you, Nick.

659
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,941
Now it isn't a secret
anymore, is it, baby?

660
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:37,819
With all the other guys
it was boring.

661
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:42,554
But with you, Nicky,
I really dug it.

662
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:46,393
Write it
in my yearbook

663
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:51,527
I loved you, Nicky.
And I was good for you.

664
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:56,075
Now you love the needle
and you're good for nothing.

665
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:58,541
Please, Nicky.

666
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,203
Please what?

667
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,838
Give me the money.

668
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:04,678
You're really
desperate, huh?

669
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:07,878
Like I'm down.
You know what I mean?

670
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,820
You want me
to straighten you, huh?

671
00:49:10,924 --> 00:49:16,453
Oh Nicky, would you?
Would you?

672
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:18,860
What do you think
of the preacher?

673
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:20,557
He's okay.
He wants to help people.

674
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,795
No! He wants
to break up the gang.

675
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,564
Why would he
want to do that?

676
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,037
Because
he's a fanatic!

677
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,074
Because he's got
a one-track mind.

678
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,405
He's gotta convert
everybody.

679
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,411
So where does that
leave you, huh?

680
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,912
Without any gangs
to mooch from

681
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,448
you'd have to whore
for your habit.

682
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,179
Think how boring
that'd be.

683
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:44,882
What do you
want me to do?

684
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,663
I want you to get
rid of the preacher.

685
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,431
How?

686
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,972
However.

687
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:05,238
Kill 'im, scare 'im,
ball 'im, I don't care.

688
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:07,711
Nicky, no.

689
00:50:07,814 --> 00:50:09,042
With him out
of the way,

690
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:10,638
you have nothing
to worry about.

691
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,377
I'll see to it.

692
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:14,976
Nicky, you're
teasing me.

693
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:18,524
You can have all
the junk you ever want.

694
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:22,424
You can even be
my girl again.

695
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:27,056
Oh my God, Nicky,
what a mess we're in.

696
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:29,498
You gonna do it?

697
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:31,695
Yeah, but
straighten me first.

698
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:32,862
Uh huh.

699
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:35,372
Do the job first.
Then I'll straighten you.

700
00:50:35,475 --> 00:50:37,636
I can't.
I need to get fixed.

701
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:42,374
I'm shakin' so I can't
even hold a knife.

702
00:50:48,354 --> 00:50:52,654
Okay, baby,
forget it.

703
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:58,629
Oh no, gimme the knife, Nicky.
I'll do it.

704
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,215
What do you think
the stuff is worth?

705
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:18,214
Few bucks.

706
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:20,114
We should da clobbered the guy
and searched the whole pad.

707
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,652
I bet he had tons
of bread

708
00:51:21,754 --> 00:51:22,948
hidden in them closets
in his shoes.

709
00:51:23,056 --> 00:51:24,080
Or in his
yarmalke.

710
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,718
Hey!
Look at this.

711
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:30,921
It was in his
jewel box.

712
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,463
The guy's
a catholic!

713
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:36,467
This worth
anything?

714
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:38,127
We gotta
take it back.

715
00:51:38,237 --> 00:51:40,000
Take it back?

716
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:42,074
It's bad luck
to steal a crucifix.

717
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:43,904
Yeah, 'cause ya can't
get nothin' for it.

718
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,171
You shut
your mouth!

719
00:51:46,279 --> 00:51:48,042
Maybe we could take it
to the hospital

720
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,774
and give it
to Mingo.

721
00:51:49,882 --> 00:51:50,712
Are you crazy?

722
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:51,943
He doesn't
even see us.

723
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:53,382
How is he going
to see this thing?

724
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:54,510
He can feel
what it is.

725
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,848
He don't
feel nothin'.

726
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:57,081
Yeah,
that's right.

727
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,216
He still in a... coma?

728
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,486
A komona?

729
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:02,652
Mingo's in a komona?

730
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:05,629
Hey, Israel,
Mingo's in a komona!

731
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:08,427
What?

732
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:11,128
Somebody's
in the clubroom.

733
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:13,000
I'll go.

734
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,412
It’s Nicky.

735
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,572
What's he doin'?

736
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,013
How should I know?
What am I, his mudder?

737
00:52:27,787 --> 00:52:28,845
What do you call these?

738
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:31,219
Tostones.

739
00:52:31,324 --> 00:52:32,916
Hmm.
These are delicious.

740
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,652
We don't have anything
like this in Philipsburg.

741
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,625
Maybe we should
open a mission there.

742
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:37,787
Seriously, David.

743
00:52:37,897 --> 00:52:39,694
You have done wonders already
with the kids in the street.

744
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,960
You've been working with
a bad bunch of apples

745
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:43,797
and you got 'em
smilin'.

746
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,531
I didn't
see Nicky smilin'.

747
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:47,901
Nicky!

748
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:49,599
Do you know what
you're dealing with

749
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,472
when you're dealing
with Nicky?

750
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:52,942
Yeah, but none
of them are breaking.

751
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,138
I get to the point where I think
I'm really getting through,

752
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:56,738
they turn me off.

753
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:58,316
They turn you off
because they're afraid

754
00:52:58,417 --> 00:52:59,884
of being
called chicken.

755
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:03,080
Being the gang, fighting,
stealing, shooting dope

756
00:53:03,189 --> 00:53:07,717
is their way of proving
that they are a man.

757
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:09,419
Yeah.

758
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:13,829
Maybe if I could just get 'em
all together in on big place -

759
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:15,423
get them to really
commit themselves

760
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:18,766
right in front of their friends
so they couldn't turn back.

761
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:20,304
You mean
like a rally?

762
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,874
Yeah, a rally.

763
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:26,433
A gang rally with all
the beeboppers, jitterbuggers
and everybody.

764
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:27,843
Now wait
a minute.

765
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:29,778
You can't tackle a hoard
of the toughest gangs

766
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:31,349
in New York
with a Bible.

767
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,748
They're liable
to crucify you.

768
00:53:33,853 --> 00:53:34,842
Where could
we get a hall?

769
00:53:34,954 --> 00:53:36,353
I think you just
lost an argument.

770
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:37,615
What kind
of a hall?

771
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:39,816
A big one, big enough
for every gang member

772
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:40,893
and junkie
in New York.

773
00:53:40,993 --> 00:53:42,051
That don't
take a hall.

774
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:43,423
That takes
the Grand Canyon.

775
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:45,224
Well, I could
get you a hall.

776
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:46,263
Will it be
expensive?

777
00:53:46,365 --> 00:53:47,923
Never mind
about that.

778
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:49,524
If you're crazy
enough to go in

779
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:51,102
with those fuzzy
faced killers,

780
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:53,866
I'll find somebody crazy
enough to pay the bill.

781
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,746
What's
the matter?

782
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,080
Nothin'.

783
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:10,485
I felt like
being by myself.

784
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,184
Bugged about
Mingo, eh?

785
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:17,194
Yeah I know.
It gets to me, too.

786
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:26,004
I just want
to know one thing.

787
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:27,970
How can you take
a guy like that?

788
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:29,234
A guy like what?

789
00:54:29,342 --> 00:54:30,570
What do you mean,
Mingo?

790
00:54:30,676 --> 00:54:31,768
I mean
the preacher.

791
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:34,573
Are you still
thinkin' about him?

792
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:45,752
What'd you rap about
that was so interesting?

793
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:47,120
When?

794
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,784
The other day,
by the school.

795
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:51,226
How do I know.
I don't even remember.

796
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,527
God loves me...
Crap like that.

797
00:54:54,634 --> 00:54:56,499
You know...

798
00:54:56,602 --> 00:54:58,832
He came to my place
at 3 o’clock in the morning

799
00:54:58,938 --> 00:55:01,270
just to tell
me that.

800
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:03,672
I almost had
a heart attack

801
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:07,678
if he wasn't right on my
doorstep, I'd a killed him.

802
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,044
So you know
what I done?

803
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:12,811
I sent Rosa over
to kill him.

804
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:15,944
I gave her the knife
and everything.

805
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:18,888
No kidding. Hey, you
think she done it?

806
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:21,016
If she did,
it'd be the first thing

807
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:23,960
she done right since
she's been on the stuff.

808
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,198
[Door buzzer]

809
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:33,294
I'll get it.

810
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:34,805
Vacation time
is the best time.

811
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:36,807
You know some of these
kids do go to school.

812
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,900
So Thanksgiving vacation
would be the time.

813
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:39,602
Right.

814
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,078
[Phone rings]

815
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,273
You know, we're gonna have
to get a bus to move these kids.

816
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,441
They're not gonna cross
each others turfs.

817
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,917
Hadn't thought
about that?

818
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,214
(Mrs. Gomez)
David.

819
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:50,914
For me?

820
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:52,456
Thank you.

821
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,185
Hello.

822
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:57,160
Hi Gwen!
It's my wife.

823
00:55:57,263 --> 00:56:01,393
[Door buzzer]

824
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,436
Rosa! Come in,
come in.

825
00:56:05,538 --> 00:56:07,062
Is the
preacher in?

826
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:09,698
What is the
matter with you?

827
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:11,504
You know
what's the matter.

828
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,407
You've seen
it before.

829
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:15,980
I'm sorry.

830
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,016
You got ten bucks?

831
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:19,448
You know the
answer to that,

832
00:56:19,552 --> 00:56:20,644
you've asked before.

833
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,482
...here with the Gomezes
and Sergeant Delano.

834
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,680
I had a wonderful meal.

835
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,120
Listen honey,
we had a great idea!

836
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:26,657
We're gonna have
a big rally -

837
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:28,124
a lot of the gangs
are going to be there...

838
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:35,565
Hector...
Oh Rosa poor baby.

839
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,033
Where's
the preacher?

840
00:56:37,136 --> 00:56:38,797
(Hector)
Why do you
want to see David?

841
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:41,771
What is this-
a police station?!

842
00:56:41,874 --> 00:56:44,274
I want to give
him something!

843
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,244
...yeah but honey,
it has to be vacation time,

844
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:54,751
it's the only time we
can get the gangs out.

845
00:56:59,425 --> 00:57:01,154
(David)
...What?

846
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,194
I want
to see you.

847
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:10,628
Please, I gotta
see you now.

848
00:57:10,736 --> 00:57:12,067
Yeah, okay...

849
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:14,765
Gwen, I know it's time
for the baby,

850
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:17,399
but aren’t babies
usually late?

851
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,636
Please?

852
00:57:18,744 --> 00:57:19,733
Sit down.

853
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:21,540
Would you like
something to eat?

854
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,445
No!

855
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,919
Uh, Gwen, honey, can I call you
back in just a few minutes?

856
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:32,286
I’ve got
an emergency here.

857
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:40,559
Oh honey, it'll be soon,
I promise. Bye.

858
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,134
I... I love...

859
00:57:43,235 --> 00:57:44,793
I want to see you,
preach.

860
00:57:44,904 --> 00:57:47,771
I gotta talk to you-
alone.

861
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:50,637
Use the chapel.

862
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:52,267
Okay.

863
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:59,050
(Sergeant Delano)
Who was that?

864
00:57:59,151 --> 00:58:00,778
It was a girl
in the neighborhood.

865
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:04,117
She's on heroin.

866
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:07,454
Glad to see you again,
Rosa.

867
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,226
Glad?
Oh sure, why?

868
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:16,733
Sit down.

869
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:22,832
Why are you glad
to see me, huh? Why?

870
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:24,341
Because I've thought
a lot about you

871
00:58:24,443 --> 00:58:27,173
since the last
time we met.

872
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:29,804
You know I love Nicky,
don't you?

873
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:31,610
No, I didn't
know that.

874
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,947
He's like
it for me.

875
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,851
Now he don't give two
pops what happens to me.

876
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,514
You know why?

877
00:58:38,624 --> 00:58:41,354
I think I do,
but you tell me.

878
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,395
He says you're trying
to break up the gang.

879
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:45,691
Break up
the gangs?

880
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:47,288
I'm trying to grab
them with something

881
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,627
that will
wake 'em up!

882
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,134
You don't care who
you hurt, do ya?

883
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,795
Take it easy,
Rosa.

884
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:56,341
Liar!

885
00:58:56,442 --> 00:58:59,900
Lend me ten bucks.

886
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:05,742
Don't touch me!

887
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:10,254
I don't have
ten bucks to lend you.

888
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:12,517
I need a fix!

889
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,991
Oh, can’t you
understand that?

890
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:17,790
A fix!

891
00:59:17,897 --> 00:59:20,365
I need it
twice a day.

892
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:23,697
And I haven't had any
since last night.

893
00:59:23,802 --> 00:59:27,863
So give me some bread,
man, I gotta score.

894
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:30,373
Rosa, I'm
no easy touch.

895
00:59:30,476 --> 00:59:32,171
I'm a man of God.

896
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,075
I'm not going to help
you kill yourself.

897
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:37,273
You're a filthy fink,
that's what you are!

898
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:41,911
You want to scare people
into believing in God.

899
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:46,424
Oh, what am I going
to do without Nicky?

900
00:59:46,525 --> 00:59:50,052
But you didn't think
about that did you?

901
00:59:50,162 --> 00:59:52,687
Rosa, if you
really want Nicky,

902
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,857
you better get
yourself clean.

903
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,401
I want ten bucks!

904
00:59:57,503 --> 01:00:00,165
And you're going
to give it to me.

905
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:03,002
Or I'll cut
it out of you!

906
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:06,009
Rosa, you
don't need that.

907
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:09,771
Rosa...

908
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,982
Help!
Don't come near me!

909
01:00:14,086 --> 01:00:17,817
Help!
He's trying to...

910
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:35,471
Step back...

911
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:38,566
I'm gonna to cut
my throat.

912
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,406
I'm gonna stick
myself like a pig

913
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,412
and you're all
gonna watch!

914
01:00:45,384 --> 01:00:49,252
Don't throw your
life away, Rosa.

915
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:52,222
You're too young.

916
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:57,489
God needs you.

917
01:00:57,596 --> 01:01:01,054
He sent you here
for help.

918
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:05,830
God wants David
to help you.

919
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,935
But there’s
no way out for me.

920
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:17,004
I'm hooked.
I'm hooked.

921
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:22,019
There's no way out.
I'm in hell!

922
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:27,286
We are here,
just for you.

923
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:31,887
Why don't you give us
a chance with you?

924
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:46,543
If there's just a chance,
just the smallest chance

925
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:50,046
that we might succeed,

926
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:54,677
isn't that worth
a try?

927
01:01:54,787 --> 01:02:01,215
Be still, Rosa.

928
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,955
Just let your
body relax.

929
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:10,434
Let your arms
hang loose, easy;

930
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:14,734
just let your mind...

931
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:25,376
That's it, Rosa...
We'll take care of you.

I'll never know
you cried for me

I'll love another
chance and then

940
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:31,682
why do the same
damn thing again?

01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:10,281
I wish he were in
that box instead of Mingo.

944
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:12,880
Yeah,
poor Mingo.

What's the matter,
you get hurt?

Hey, Nicky.

953
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:11,253
It's me, Little Bo.

954
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:15,891
I sometimes run
for your gang.

955
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:21,303

help or somethin'?

help, friend?

I'll be
all right.

958

We gotta get
you to a doctor.

959
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,150
Get away from me.

960
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:14,351

wanted to see me.

your mind?

Nicky, I gotta say
two things to you.

963
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:23,726
Yeah, Jesus loves me
and you love me.

964

I heard it before.

965

Hey, man,
no kidding, look.

967

and my head is busted.

a poor spik a break?

Can't you see
I'm dying?

971
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:44,516
How can I just
walk away and leave you?

be there waiting.

it alone, Bo.

mind helping.

be happy, Nicky.

1052
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,872
No problem.

1053
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:11,381
First one's always
on the house.

1054
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:13,508
Gee, it's good
to have you back.

1055
01:15:13,618 --> 01:15:14,846
I don't
have any fixins.

1056
01:15:14,953 --> 01:15:16,978
No problem.

1057
01:15:17,088 --> 01:15:20,114
The first one
comes with fixins.

1058
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,098
Whenever a steady
customer doesn't show up

1059
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,768
for a few days,
it worries me.

1060
01:15:39,878 --> 01:15:43,370
You know, like maybe I hurt
their feelings or something.

1061
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,881
I can't
make it work!

1062
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:47,576
Relax.

1063
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:51,485
Just call for
room service.

1064
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:57,619
We bone it...
(Singing)...

1065
01:16:18,883 --> 01:16:24,150
Saute it...
(Humming and whistling)...

1066
01:16:43,508 --> 01:16:51,916
Wash the silverware...
(Humming)...

1067
01:16:56,387 --> 01:17:04,954
Fill the sugar tip...
(Humming and whistling)

1068
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,337
And serve it
with a smile.

1069
01:17:21,713 --> 01:17:35,389
[Whistling]

1070
01:17:35,493 --> 01:17:39,190
That's it baby.
Let it out.

1071
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:42,289
Let all the bad
run out.

1072
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,270
Nothing in there now
but the cool, cool snow.

1073
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:55,176
Now let your
head drift off,

1074
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:03,482
drift off into that
purple-violet-squish.

1075
01:18:11,629 --> 01:18:13,256
You cut it!

1076
01:18:13,364 --> 01:18:16,458
Ssh, ssh.
Don't fight it.

1077
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,536
You're selling
garbage!

1078
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:23,095
I didn't sell
you nothing, baby!

1079
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:28,509
I gave it,
and it's the best.

1080
01:18:28,613 --> 01:18:32,208
Put it on
your tongue.

1081
01:18:32,316 --> 01:18:33,544
Taste it.

1082
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:35,812
You taste quinine?
Do you taste sugar?

1083
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,582
No sir, baby,
you taste pure junk.

1084
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,180
I don't
feel the same.

1085
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,885
It’s like a bad drink
or a tranquilizer.

1086
01:18:42,994 --> 01:18:45,019
I've seen 'em trying
to get a free taster before

1087
01:18:45,129 --> 01:18:48,292
but baby,
you're the best.

1088
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:50,833
The second one's
no freebee, baby,

1089
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,267
it's ten bucks and so
is the third, the fourth

1090
01:18:53,371 --> 01:18:55,498
and the four thousandth!

1091
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,335
Get yourself out
in the street, baby

1092
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,433
and you better learn to turn
a sweet trick or two

1093
01:18:59,544 --> 01:19:01,239
because you gonna have to bring
your tail in here more often

1094
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:02,903
and it better be waggin'
up ten dollar bills

1095
01:19:03,014 --> 01:19:05,915
'cause you're already
behind by one!

1096
01:19:06,017 --> 01:19:07,416
And stay away from
that preacher!

1097
01:19:07,518 --> 01:19:10,885
Somebody's messin'
with your head!

1098
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,468
I know what
you're thinking.

1099
01:20:02,573 --> 01:20:05,235

good niks out there.

(David)
All I see
is empty seats.

1101
01:20:07,311 --> 01:20:08,744
Yeah.

1102
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,337
Maybe I'm the reason
they're not coming.

1103
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:14,316
The gangs know
there's a cop around.

1104
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:18,081
They may think it's
a trap or something.

1105
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:22,091
You think so?

1106
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,559
It's a
thought anyway.

1107
01:20:24,662 --> 01:20:27,563
I won't show up
tomorrow.

1108
01:20:27,665 --> 01:20:32,932
They'll see there's no
squad cars parked outside.

1109
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,767
We just won't hang
around at all.

1110
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,434
That is if you think
you can handle them.

1111
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:44,880
I don't see much fight
in those empty seats.

1112

[Dramatic music]

1113
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:17,578
You dudes trampled
my man's grave.

1114
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:20,116
Yeah, baby.
So what's the beef?

1115
01:21:20,218 --> 01:21:24,917
Hey.
I'll talk

1116
01:21:25,022 --> 01:21:27,286
yeah, a few of the people
got out of hand.

1117
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:28,881
You saying
you're sorry?

1118
01:21:28,993 --> 01:21:31,621
I don't
apologize!

1119
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:33,697
And I don't
talk to seconds.

I'm talkin',
Nick.

1121

My people
want blood.

1122
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:45,340
Well then,
blood there'll be, baby.

1123
01:21:45,443 --> 01:21:46,341
When?

1124
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:47,604
Whenever.

1125
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:48,610
Tonight.

1126
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:49,577
Where?

1127
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,510
The park.

1128
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,310
Stick the park.
We had the park!

Clam up!

01:21:53,918 --> 01:21:55,112
Well, what
did it prove?

1131
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:57,346
We trample some grass
and jitterbug around a bonfire

1132
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,480
and whose
turf is it?

1133
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:03,226
I say we have it out
once and for all.

1134
01:22:03,327 --> 01:22:04,851
Winners get the turf.

1135
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,395
Right, baby.

1136
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:07,759
But whose winners?

1137
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:10,197
What do we do, count cuts,
bruises and broken bones?

1138
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:12,667
Last man standin',
that's winners.

1139
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,032
How you gonna
do that?

1140
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,435
Soon as we get it on,

1141

everybody runs
all over the city.

where they can't run.

What the hell
are you talkin' about?

1144
01:22:20,378 --> 01:22:21,504

1145

Man, there's
fuzz all over the place.

1146
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:24,813
Not tonight.

1147
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:26,611
Words around that
the fuzz is laying off

1148
01:22:26,717 --> 01:22:28,514
to give the come-on
to us gangs.

1149
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:29,517
So?

on with all we got.

seal off the doors.

1152

Then we have it on.

you were to lay back?

of that store bought stuff.

making it.

is the first time

of the whole thing.

Mary sing.

1173

Maybe that'll
cool 'em down.

will break upon the shore

will go hungry anymore

new morning over there

new world for us to share

an end to unkind words

no God will know he is a fool

of life and the only rule

new morning over there,

of you gang members to do it.

finished collecting,

take the money through
that back stage door

man.

put it together in a bundle

in the rumble.

cock-sure of himself,

he knows that everybody
in this place

1211

expects us to cop
this bread.

I bet he's going to pop some
stupid sermon about honesty.

1213

I say we cross him up,
and take all the bread

1214
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:03,022
and we give it to
that stupid preacher.

1215

That's cool,
man.

preacher.

1217

Yeah,
every cent of it.

about giving money]

You know, we all like to put
tags on people, don't we?

1221
01:32:12,169 --> 01:32:17,129
Try to make 'em
like everybody else.

1222

those guys to collect the money

01:32:18,942 --> 01:32:23,572
was like askin' a junkie
to guard a drug store.

1224
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,672
[Laughter]

1225
01:32:26,783 --> 01:32:30,617
Right?

1226
01:32:30,721 --> 01:32:33,189
But they fooled you,
didn't they?

1227
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:34,848
They wouldn't
wear your tags.

1228
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:36,152
They shook free.

1229
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,956
(Shout from the audience)
They did it because
they were suckers!

1230
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:40,427
[Laughter]

1231
01:32:40,531 --> 01:32:42,863
There's nobody in this
world that can tag you

1232
01:32:42,966 --> 01:32:47,665
'cause nobody knows how
you really feel inside.

1233
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:50,399
No friend, no gang
member, no deb

1234
01:32:50,507 --> 01:32:53,704
or ditty bopper or preacher
or priest or rabbi,

1235
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:57,473
or social worker
or psychiatrist, nobody!

1236
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:00,914
'Cause your mind,
your feelings, your spirit

1237
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:04,476
are so fantastic it would
take a mind bigger

1238
01:33:04,588 --> 01:33:09,821
than the whole world
to understand you.

1239
01:33:09,927 --> 01:33:14,728
That's why I don't
preach religion.

1240
01:33:14,831 --> 01:33:18,267
I preach about a man.

1241
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:22,771
The only one who knows
why you do the things you do.

1242
01:33:22,873 --> 01:33:25,501
The only one who knows
what's bugging you,

1243
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:27,543
what's eating you.

1244
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:31,774
And the only one who has the
power to do anything about it.

1245
01:33:31,882 --> 01:33:36,751
Now I want every ditty bop off
and I want you to listen to me.

1246
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:38,844
Go on, take 'em off.

1247
01:33:38,956 --> 01:33:40,548
Don't be looking around
at somebody else

1248
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:42,488
to see what everybody
else is doing.

1249
01:33:42,593 --> 01:33:47,257
Have the guts to be different.
To listen for once.

1250
01:33:47,364 --> 01:33:49,764
Now I'm makin' this
God's house right now.

1251
01:33:49,866 --> 01:33:52,357
And this is a pulpit.

1252
01:33:52,469 --> 01:33:57,406
And I'm gonna talk and if you've
go the guts - you'll listen.

1253
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,702
I'm gonna talk
about a man.

1254
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:02,677
And I'm gonna
talk about love.

1255
01:34:02,779 --> 01:34:06,476
That's right, love!
The word that bugs you.

1256
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:07,675
It's a sissy word
to most of you.

1257
01:34:07,784 --> 01:34:10,275
You're going to see tonight
that love is the gutsiest word

1258
01:34:10,387 --> 01:34:12,855
in the English
language.

1259
01:34:12,956 --> 01:34:16,357
I've got to try and make you
understand the meaning of love.

1260
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,587
Love isn't just
something you feel.

1261
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,390
Love is something
you do.

1262
01:34:20,497 --> 01:34:23,193
It's got nothing to do with weak
knees or a fluttering heart.

1263
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,133
Love is the gutsiest act
that you'll ever do.

1264
01:34:26,236 --> 01:34:28,932
Because love is turning
away from hate.

1265
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,304
That takes guts!

1266
01:34:32,409 --> 01:34:36,778
Now this book says
"God is love".

1267
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,714
God looked at the sins
in our heart.

1268
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:43,752
All our hearts-
yours, mine, everybody's.

1269
01:34:43,854 --> 01:34:46,516
And he hated those sins.

1270
01:34:46,623 --> 01:34:48,989
But God turned away
from his own hate

1271
01:34:49,092 --> 01:34:53,426
and sent his only son into
the world to love us.

1272
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,522
Jesus was a package
of pure love.

1273
01:34:56,633 --> 01:35:02,299
Sweet, straight love.
For you and for me.

1274
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:05,102
I don't care
who you've cut.

1275
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:07,676
I don't care what you've
been smoking' or shooting,

1276
01:35:07,778 --> 01:35:10,611
I don't care who you
been layin' around with,

1277
01:35:10,714 --> 01:35:13,683
God loves
you anyway.

1278
01:35:13,784 --> 01:35:15,376
I know each one
of you here

1279
01:35:15,485 --> 01:35:17,578
knows about
the Ten Commandments.

1280
01:35:17,688 --> 01:35:20,248
Most of you have broken
every one of 'em.

1281
01:35:20,357 --> 01:35:24,885
God knows about that too.

1282
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:28,692
He knows about your angers,
you fears, your frustrations.

1283
01:35:28,799 --> 01:35:31,097
He knows that most
of you have fought.

1284
01:35:31,201 --> 01:35:35,604
Some of you have
even killed.

1285
01:35:35,706 --> 01:35:38,834
But God also knows what you
can be like in the future.

1286
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:41,502
Not just what you've
been in the past.

1287
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,045
Jesus said there is just
one great commandment.

1288
01:35:44,147 --> 01:35:46,479
That you love God with
all you heart, your soul,

1289
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:50,713
your mind and your
neighbor as yourself.

1290
01:35:50,821 --> 01:35:53,346
He said, "a new commandment
I give unto you

1291
01:35:53,457 --> 01:35:58,622
that you love
one another.'

1292
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:05,328
I'm gonna ask God right now
for a miracle.

1293
01:36:05,435 --> 01:36:09,098
Father, I'm askin'
you now for a miracle,

1294
01:36:09,206 --> 01:36:14,769
that in this next moment
these live will be changed.

1295
01:36:14,878 --> 01:36:17,540
I'm asking you Mau Maus
to turn away from hating

1296
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,844
your black
brothers.

1297
01:36:20,951 --> 01:36:25,888
I'm asking you Bishops
to forgive the white man's sin-

1298
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,820
just as God
forgives yours.

1299
01:36:27,924 --> 01:36:29,050
Look at this,
preacher!

1300
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:30,524
See this hole
I got in me.

1301
01:36:30,627 --> 01:36:32,458
It came from one of them
nigger zip guns,

1302
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:34,530
and you say that I'm
supposed to love them.

1303
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:35,825
Man, you're not real!

1304
01:36:35,932 --> 01:36:36,830
Hey, man.

1305
01:36:36,933 --> 01:36:38,594
My brother died from
a Mau Mau rumble.

1306
01:36:38,702 --> 01:36:40,670
And you say you want me
to love them honkies?

1307
01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:42,238
Yeah, man,
I'm gonna love 'em.

1308
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:44,307
I'm gonna love 'em
with a sharp blade.

1309
01:36:44,407 --> 01:36:46,204
Now you shut up
and listen to me.

1310
01:36:46,309 --> 01:36:49,005
You say you gotta kill them
because of what they did to you.

1311
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:50,670
And you've got to kill
them because of what

1312
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:52,248
they've done to you.

1313
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:54,613
Everybody's gripping about
this atrocity and that tragedy.

1314
01:36:54,718 --> 01:36:59,815
All I hear is what
a rotten deal we've all got.

1315
01:36:59,923 --> 01:37:03,620
Let me tell you something.
Jesus Christ was perfect!

1316
01:37:03,727 --> 01:37:08,960
And they
crucified him!

1317
01:37:09,065 --> 01:37:11,829
He never said one
complaining word.

1318
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:17,168
And when he died on that cross,
he was a man!

1319
01:37:17,274 --> 01:37:19,834
Like you, he had
the same fears

1320
01:37:19,943 --> 01:37:22,104
and the same feelings
that you have.

1321
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:25,545
He felt pain just
the way you feel pain.

1322
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:30,177
He had those nails driven
into the flesh of the hands.

1323
01:37:30,287 --> 01:37:36,851
His hands, his hands, the most
sensitive part of his body.

1324
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,899
And his feet, they drove
a spike into his feet.

1325
01:37:42,999 --> 01:37:48,266
And they nailed his hands
and feet to the cross.

1326
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:51,431
And he didn't have to let
them do that to him.

1327
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:53,736
He could have called down
a whole legion of angels

1328
01:37:53,844 --> 01:37:56,005
to take him down
from that cross.

1329
01:37:56,112 --> 01:37:59,081
He could have slaughtered
all his tormentors.

1330
01:37:59,182 --> 01:38:01,241
But he didn't.

1331
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:08,382
He hung there.
Bleeding. For you.

1332
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:14,521
And he died there.
For you.

1333
01:38:14,631 --> 01:38:17,532
So you wouldn't have
to die here today.

1334
01:38:17,634 --> 01:38:21,070
So you wouldn't have
to kill here today.

1335
01:38:21,171 --> 01:38:23,969
Why don't you stop crying
about the sins of the past.

1336
01:38:24,074 --> 01:38:25,837
Stop paying
for those sins.

1337
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:28,843
Man, it's all paid up.
It's free!

1338
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,436
All you have to do
it just accept it.

1339
01:38:31,548 --> 01:38:35,917
Just open up your hearts and
let all that bitterness run out.

1340
01:38:36,019 --> 01:38:40,149
And let Jesus Christ
come in!

1341
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:42,418
(Echo the voice of preach)
Just open up your hearts
and let all that bitterness

1342
01:38:42,525 --> 01:38:46,791
run out and let
Jesus Christ come in...

1343
01:38:46,897 --> 01:38:48,728
Come in... come in...
Come in... come in...

1344
01:38:49,165 --> 01:38:51,656
Come in... come in...

1345
01:38:51,768 --> 01:38:52,860
Listen!

1346
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:55,460
All you white cats!
And all you black cats!

1347
01:38:55,572 --> 01:38:56,971
Listen to me.

1348
01:38:57,073 --> 01:38:59,633
Now you been hearing
about the power of love.

1349
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:01,734
Well, I'm going to tell
you about another power.

1350
01:39:01,845 --> 01:39:03,278
It's gang power.

1351
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:05,075
And that's
where it's at.

1352
01:39:05,181 --> 01:39:08,742
Now the Bishops and the Mau Maus
are having it out here tonight.

1353
01:39:08,852 --> 01:39:11,480
And you're going
to be in on it.

1354
01:39:11,588 --> 01:39:12,919
You can't get away.

1355
01:39:13,023 --> 01:39:15,548
All the exits
are shut off.

1356
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,650
And you might
as well face it, man,

1357
01:39:17,761 --> 01:39:21,561
we are going to have it out
right here and now!

1358
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:25,726
[Shouting with music]

1359
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:30,135
Cool it.
I said cool it now!

1360
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:34,370
Hasn't there been enough
killing and cutting?!

1361
01:39:34,477 --> 01:39:36,536
Weren’t you listenin'
to the preacher?

1362
01:39:36,646 --> 01:39:41,640
Well, I heard
the preacher...

1363
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:45,278
I don't know
how to say it.

1364
01:39:45,388 --> 01:39:50,087
He's here.
You feel him.

1365
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:54,994
You all feel him.

1366
01:39:55,098 --> 01:40:01,094
He's here in this room
and he wants to touch you.

1367
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:07,575
If you ever want your lives
changed, now is the time.

1368
01:40:07,677 --> 01:40:09,542
Put your weapons away.

1369
01:40:09,646 --> 01:40:12,171
There's not going to be
a rumble here tonight.

1370
01:40:12,282 --> 01:40:16,309
You're in the presence
of the almighty God.

1371
01:40:16,419 --> 01:40:18,819
Come on up
here together.

1372
01:40:18,922 --> 01:40:21,686
Stand.
Come on.

1373
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,418
Not as saints.

1374
01:40:23,526 --> 01:40:24,720
Don't wait till
you're good enough

1375
01:40:24,828 --> 01:40:26,796
because that day's
never gonna come.

1376
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:28,022
Come on.

1377
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:33,398
Come on with all your hangups
and let Jesus clean you up.

1378
01:40:33,503 --> 01:40:37,405
And would you come.
Let your coming say it.

1379
01:40:37,507 --> 01:40:42,206
God I need you.
God forgive me.

1380
01:40:42,312 --> 01:40:47,716
God I give myself to you.

1381
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:58,924
Hey, man.

1382
01:40:59,029 --> 01:41:04,524
I know you got love.
I can feel it in ya.

1383
01:41:04,634 --> 01:41:07,194
'Cause I ain't scared
of you no more.

1384
01:41:14,511 --> 01:41:16,001
Nicky!!

1385
01:41:21,584 --> 01:41:24,553
Man, I got your life
right in my hands.

1386
01:41:24,654 --> 01:41:36,191
I can take it away,
or I can give it back to you...

1387
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:41,532
I'm gonna give it
back to you.

1388
01:41:41,638 --> 01:41:47,975
Wow, man...

1389
01:41:48,078 --> 01:41:53,744
I really don't dig this
scene tonight at all.

1390
01:41:59,389 --> 01:42:04,486
God loves you,
he loves you

1391
01:42:04,594 --> 01:42:10,328
just as you are
now standing there

1392
01:42:10,433 --> 01:42:16,099
in your cold, dark
and bitter, little world,

1393
01:42:16,206 --> 01:42:28,676
he loves you, he loves you
his hand is reaching out...

1394
01:42:28,785 --> 01:42:34,746
I'm gonna give
my life to God, Davey.

1395
01:42:34,858 --> 01:42:38,259
It better work 'cause
I damn near got killed for it.

1396
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:43,128
...and his love is stronger
than anything...

1397
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:45,463
This is the miracle,
Nicky.

1398
01:42:45,568 --> 01:42:47,536
The miracle I've
been praying for.

1399
01:42:47,637 --> 01:42:51,869
God loves Nicky, too

1400
01:42:51,975 --> 01:42:54,341
this is the miracle
I'm talkin' about.

1401
01:42:54,444 --> 01:42:56,378
That you're gonna find
yourselves tonight.

1402
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,175
You're gonna know in your
hearts it was a miracle

1403
01:42:59,282 --> 01:43:03,013
so you'll never trust
in you own flesh again.

1404
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:09,991
But in the flesh sacrificed
for you by Jesus!

1405
01:43:10,093 --> 01:43:12,084
I want you all
to have Bibles.

1406
01:43:12,195 --> 01:43:17,792
Gomezes, help
me please.

1407
01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:25,602
Hey, hey,
hey preach.

1408
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,801
How about givin' us one
of those big books

1409
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:28,605
so people can really see
what we’re carrying.

1410
01:43:28,711 --> 01:43:29,939
Hey, preach,
me too.

1411
01:43:33,616 --> 01:43:35,106
Me too, preach.

1412
01:43:37,187 --> 01:43:39,621
You look kinda
different, Nick

1413
01:43:39,722 --> 01:43:40,916
how?

1414
01:43:41,024 --> 01:43:46,257
Bright.
All kinds of shiney.

1415
01:43:46,362 --> 01:43:51,925
Maybe it's because I'm about
two minutes old right now.

1416
01:43:52,035 --> 01:43:55,664
I'm different too.

1417
01:43:55,772 --> 01:43:59,139
I know.

1418
01:43:59,242 --> 01:44:02,803
You kicked the junk.

1419
01:44:02,912 --> 01:44:06,006
Oh, Nicky,
I'm free now.

1420
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:09,141
I'm really free.

1421
01:44:15,058 --> 01:44:16,184
Hey!

1422
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:18,192
I'm all over
this book!

1423
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:21,058
My name
is in the Bible!

1424
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:26,731
Israel... Israel...
Israel... Israel...

1425
01:44:26,836 --> 01:44:29,327
I'm practically
on every page.

1426
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,738
[Laughter]

1427
01:44:39,282 --> 01:44:41,341
[Preacher speaking]
So this was the beginning.

1428
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:44,443
The breakthrough that was
to make the ghetto my church.

1429
01:44:44,554 --> 01:44:47,853
Little did I know it was going
to lead to our own center,

1430
01:44:47,957 --> 01:44:50,187
a home where lonely,
mixed up kids

1431
01:44:50,293 --> 01:44:53,387
could be given
a new beginning.

1432
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:56,659
Or that from the tortured
streets of Harlem and Brooklyn,

1433
01:44:56,766 --> 01:44:58,063
the Teen Challenge
concept would spread

1434
01:44:58,167 --> 01:44:59,464
across the land
to other cities,

1435
01:44:59,569 --> 01:45:04,404
to other Nickys
and Israels and Rosas.

1436
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:11,140
Surrounding them with love
instead of hate and fear.

1437
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:14,011
One thing
I already knew,

1438
01:45:14,117 --> 01:45:16,142
in the battle for souls
that surges through

1439
01:45:16,252 --> 01:45:18,618
the tenement lined alleys
and the back street,

1440
01:45:18,721 --> 01:45:21,019
you can take it from
this skinny preacher

1441
01:45:21,124 --> 01:45:23,422
from the hills
of Pennsylvania,

1442
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:28,054
the cross is mightier
than the switchblade.

1443
01:46:28,006 --> 01:46:29,054
