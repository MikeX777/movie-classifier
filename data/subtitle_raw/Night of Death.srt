1
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:12,021
NIGHT OF DEATH!

2
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:39,995
Martine?

3
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,326
DEAR SERGE

4
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:05,048
"Darling...

5
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,887
Our argument was ridiculous.
Please forget it.

6
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:12,952
I don't want to be a burden,
so I've decided to leave.

7
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,707
I'm going to take the job
you so kindly found for me.

8
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:21,534
Thanks again. "

9
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,640
- I'm here for the job.
- There is no job.

10
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,052
But-

11
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,178
- This is Deadlock House, right?
- Yes.

12
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,686
I want to see the director.

13
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:52,888
I was sent this letter.

14
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,617
Read it, if you don't believe me.

15
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,456
What is this, a prison?

16
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:06,778
Convenient for visitors!
Do they need a pass?

17
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,106
Was it from the war?

18
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,214
Which one?

19
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,042
Birth defect.

20
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:26,302
It's quiet here.

21
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,955
A FILM BY

22
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,565
- Wait here.
- Outside?

23
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,223
Here.

24
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:55,607
I don't think I'll last long here...

25
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,762
Mr. Léon!

26
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,279
Mr. Léon!
I'm sick of chasing you!

27
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:30,270
I don't want a damn shot!

28
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,432
- You must have your shot.
- I don't want it!

29
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,026
Follow me.

30
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:09,430
Sorry.

31
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,954
We expected you tomorrow,
not today.

32
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,778
I admire initiative...

33
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,246
but detest excessive zeal!

34
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,547
One day early
doesn't change much.

35
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,686
That's your opinion, not mine.

36
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,239
- So?
- So?

37
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,639
You're problematic.

38
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,623
Hello?

39
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,745
No, don't worry.

40
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,789
Certainly. That's right.

41
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,805
I'll call you back.

42
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,075
I have nowhere else to go.

43
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:56,987
- How did she get here?
- By bus.

44
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,647
- Who saw her?
- Everyone.

45
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:08,663
Prepare a place for her in the attic.

46
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,741
- But-
- I know!

47
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,221
You see, dear...

48
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,799
I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow,
nothing is ready.

49
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,351
But here you are!
Tonight you'll sleep on a cot in the attic...

50
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:24,382
and tomorrow-

51
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,261
Don't worry, I can sleep anywhere.
Even on the floor.

52
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:32,628
What's going on? Tell me!

53
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,198
I haven't quit.

54
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,976
Unless I'm being fired...

55
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,468
That's it- I'm being fired,
without warning!

56
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,805
You're wrong, dear,
you're not being fired.

57
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,391
- Then what's she doing here?
- The same job as you.

58
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,055
I do fine on my own.

59
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:53,144
Ever since you've arrived
you've complained!

60
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,986
- I was just griping.
- I believed you, so I hired Miss Clement.

61
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,223
Wonderful!

62
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,693
With all our free time,
we'll twiddle our thumbs.

63
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,752
In the meantime, why don't you show
Miss Clement around?

64
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:13,150
You don't seem to like her much.

65
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:17,109
That's for sure! And the others,
they're annoying as hell. You'll see.

66
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:18,775
They drive me nuts, I swear.

67
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,766
- Been here long?
- Two months.

68
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,526
- Don't you ever knock?
- No time.

69
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,477
Young people do whatever they please!

70
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,020
- Did you wet the bed again?
- Absolutely.

71
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,533
At your age?

72
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,670
It can happen at any age.

73
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,662
I piss in reaction.

74
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,166
You know...

75
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,881
perhaps you shouldn't drink
before going to bed.

76
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,563
How sweet!

77
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:47,637
Unlike you!

78
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,590
What are you knitting?
A sweater, a scarf?

79
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,469
When my work is finished...

80
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,414
the old people's revolt will begin!

81
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,878
I'm knitting revolution!

82
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,991
- Nicole!
- What?

83
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:07,574
- What day is it?
- You already asked. The 28th.

84
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,362
Get it through your skull.
The 28th.

85
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,982
28, 28...

86
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,351
We spend a lot of time here.

87
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,615
The meals aren't complicated,
they're all vegetarians.

88
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:23,390
They don't want to get fat,
don't want to get old. Typical old people.

89
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,396
- We eat what they eat?
- Yes.

90
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,226
With my appetite,
it won't be easy!

91
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,149
Better get used to it.

92
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,930
At the orphanage, I shined the pots.

93
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,820
- I'm an orphan, too.
- Really?

94
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:37,659
You certainly don't
take care of your pots.

95
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,897
- We never use them.
- It's a shame.

96
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,836
Ready?

97
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,085
- I'll take care of them.
- What?

98
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:48,531
- The pots.
- If it makes you happy!

99
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:53,243
- I'll kill you!
- Save me! He's picking on me!

100
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,750
I'll kill him!

101
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:58,359
- I'll kill him like the Golden Needle Killer!
- But he only kills women!

102
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,829
You're a woman, I know it.

103
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,386
That's enough, Mr. Léon.

104
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,243
Bitch!

105
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:12,795
Comrades, revolution is at hand.

106
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:16,375
From all corners of the world,
old people and children...

107
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:19,348
the forgotten, the useless...

108
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:23,645
will form an army
of the Future and the Past...

109
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:25,717
to fight the final battle!

110
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,660
That's the whole lot.

111
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,774
They're a bit weird, as you'll see...

112
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,439
but they're not bad.

113
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:34,233
Typical old people.

114
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,329
I lack 432 calories.

115
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,991
- Martine?
- Ma'am?

116
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,062
I hope you'll manage my meals
better than your co-worker.

117
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,141
Should I make something else?

118
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:19,996
No point.
I'll make up for it tonight.

119
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,551
You may go.

120
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,037
Although the first few days,
I really thought I'd quit.

121
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,071
But I ended up staying.

122
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,701
Jobs are so hard to find, you know?

123
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,092
You'll see, at first they're annoying...

124
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,010
then it gets easier.

125
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,477
- The hardest is not being able to go out.
- We never go out?

126
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:14,298
Never. For the first two months.

127
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:18,773
Ms. Hélène says it's necessary
for the old people to adapt to you.

128
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:22,302
- You'll have your first day off soon?
- That's right!

129
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,286
I haven't seen my man for two months.

130
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,291
It's going to be wild!

131
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,221
- Have you got a guy?
- Yes.

132
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,726
What's he like?

133
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:34,557
He's smart, charming, and...

134
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:35,734
And?

135
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,522
He's a great lover.

136
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,990
- Can I meet him?
- I'm really jealous.

137
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,745
Don't worry, so am I.

138
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,669
- I'm crazy about my guy.
- What's he like?

139
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,003
I'll show you a picture,
you'll see for yourself.

140
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,297
Sweetie, you'll fall for him!

141
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,655
Unbelievable.

142
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:00,756
- Hey, look.
- What?

143
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,734
That's Léon.
He walks as well as you and I.

144
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,761
The wheelchair is just to bug people.
Old people, I swear!

145
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,308
- Where's that photo?
- Hold on.

146
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,871
What is it?

147
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:20,059
- Telephone.
- For me?

148
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,428
- Yes, you.
- Really?

149
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:28,214
- What do you want?
- The new girl seems nice.

150
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:29,431
Unlike me.

151
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,673
Why are you so mean to me?

152
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,498
I'm not mean to you.

153
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,835
I just find you extremely unpleasant.

154
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,613
What do you want?

155
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:49,756
Nicole...

156
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,440
would you marry a man like me?

157
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,550
- I didn't say me.
- I understood you.

158
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,738
- Too bad.
- Why?

159
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,308
Yes.

160
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,227
I don't know if I can.

161
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,887
Hold on.

162
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,598
Ma'am, my fiancé wants to know-

163
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,069
He wants to-

164
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,564
Could I have the night off?

165
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,252
- Excuse me, but-
- I heard you. I was thinking.

166
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:37,237
In case your co-worker didn't tell you,
outings are forbidden the first two months.

167
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,342
- I know. She told me.
- She's improving.

168
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:44,788
Since you don't start until tomorrow,
I'll make an exception. You may go out.

169
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:45,842
Thank you, ma'am.

170
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,860
Hello? It's okay.

171
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,690
At 8:00.

172
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,092
Of course I'll be alone.
Who would I bring?

173
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,359
Okay, take care.

174
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,892
- Martine?
- Ma'am?

175
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,838
You've just had your only phone call.

176
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,495
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:06,743
That's the good thing
about working here.

178
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,213
I'll stay a few more months
and then I'll leave.

179
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,252
- So it does have good points!
- Sure.

180
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,919
I'd like to buy a café with Maurice.

181
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:14,910
You still haven't shown me his photo!

182
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,948
We have plenty of time, now.

183
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,634
What's that?

184
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,101
- The boiler room. Want to see it?
- Sure.

185
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,975
- There's nothing to see.
- Stupid jerk!

186
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,502
- That guy bugs me.
- It must be hard to be like him.

187
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,054
Oh! Saint Martine!

188
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,842
- Then, he took my hand!
- I don't believe it!

189
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,568
It's the whole truth!

190
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,493
What a charmer!

191
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:49,715
Hey, buddy.

192
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,382
Hello.

193
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,690
You're so lucky.

194
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,922
As soon as they've finished their party,
I'm off to bed.

195
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,772
Say...

196
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,765
- give a kiss to...
- Serge.

197
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:02,423
... Serge for me.

198
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,475
You'll introduce me?

199
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:05,109
Yes.

200
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,621
- Hang in there.
- Bye.

201
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,485
Mr. Léon, what is this?

202
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,590
Don't move.

203
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,156
Hands up?

204
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,880
Keep laughing, stupid bitch!

205
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,665
- Listen, you-
- Don't move!

206
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,457
- Mr. Léon-
- Don't move!

207
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,365
Jerk!

208
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,958
You slapped me,
so I stained your dress!

209
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,622
Look at that!

210
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,726
- I'm telling the director!
- Perhaps you shouldn't have slapped him.

211
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,351
This goody-goody act of yours
is really getting on my nerves!

212
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,551
- Well, good-bye.
- Bye.

213
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,986
Mr. Flavien, please open the gate.

214
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,902
Return it to me tomorrow.

215
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,567
Thanks.

216
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,147
<i>We fall asleep</i>
<i>It's a mistake</i>

217
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:26,965
<i>We're old and grey</i>
<i>When we awake</i>

218
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:32,341
<i>Like a blood-thirsty tiger</i>

219
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:37,943
<i>Your claws are sharp</i>
<i>I hate you</i>

220
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:44,406
<i>We are afraid to see youth fly</i>

221
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:51,323
<i>And we are afraid to die</i>

222
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:57,499
<i>Your face is dark and dry</i>

223
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:04,603
<i>Your claws are sharp</i>
<i>I hate you</i>

224
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,979
- Who wants it?
- I do!

225
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:11,029
<i>You believe</i>
<i>that you hold sway</i>

226
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,133
<i>You give life</i>
<i>You take it away</i>

227
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:24,407
<i>But now it's time</i>
<i>for you to pray</i>

228
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,030
<i>Though your claws are sharp</i>

229
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:30,003
<i>And I hate you</i>

230
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:34,330
<i>TimeI</i>

231
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,401
<i>I'll get youI</i>

232
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:26,263
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

233
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,926
I had a nightmare.

234
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,234
Calm down, honey.
Your heart is pounding.

235
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,741
It was awful.

236
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,398
What time is it?

237
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,917
- 1:00 a. m.
- I'd better get back.

238
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,226
Not so soon.

239
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:42,588
It's my first day tomorrow, I need rest.

240
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:44,893
Just a little longer.

241
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,030
You don't know how strict the director is!

242
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,818
I don't care.
Now I've got you, I'm keeping you.

243
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,545
Nicole, are you asleep?

244
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:56,115
"Forgive me for calling you a goody-goody.
That idiot really pissed me off.

245
00:23:56,221 --> 00:24:00,924
I'm glad we met
and I'm sure we'll be good friends.

246
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,542
Sleep well and don't dream of Serge...

247
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,206
you'll just be more frustrated!

248
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,349
Take care, Nicole. "

249
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:55,069
It's the new girl. Let's try her.

250
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,206
Don't be so greedy!

251
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,548
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

252
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:14,012
You sure did! Who are you?

253
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,558
- Are you new here?
- You're very observant.

254
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:24,978
- Where's Nicole?
- Are you done?

255
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:26,645
Yes.

256
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:40,860
Who's there?

257
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,306
- It's the gestapo!
- Be nice, Mr. Jules.

258
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:49,046
Your sweater is growing.

259
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:54,712
It's like a revolution: each row
is an army marching onward.

260
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,374
When will this revolution occur?

261
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,452
Imagine a huge army-

262
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,597
an old person, a child,
an old person, a child.

263
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:03,702
- Interested?
- Yes.

264
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:06,489
- I'll keep you informed.
- Thanks.

265
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,277
But...

266
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:12,822
I promise.

267
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:24,982
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

268
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,809
Sometimes it's dangerous to fall sleep.

269
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,732
Waking up is much nicer.

270
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,652
Thanks.

271
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,848
You can keep the poison
you call coffee.

272
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,990
Luckily, I have my own.

273
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:40,345
Mr. Flavien.

274
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,228
I wanted to apologize
for picking flowers.

275
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,223
Nicole wasn't in her room
this morning.

276
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:49,781
Once you've finished breakfast...

277
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:52,700
Ms. Hélène wants to see you.

278
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,254
What about Nicole?

279
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,918
Hello. Did you sleep well?

280
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:02,745
Yes, thanks.

281
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:06,457
And then...

282
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:07,964
he kissed me.

283
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,265
- Just like that?
- Like that.

284
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,002
She came to see me
right after you left.

285
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,141
We had a terrible argument.

286
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:20,410
She was unbelievably aggressive
and insolent.

287
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,549
I fired her immediately.

288
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:24,694
You can have her room.

289
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:27,164
Was the argument about me?

290
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:28,668
Obviously.

291
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:31,864
She accused me of hiring you
behind her back...

292
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:34,485
and once she'd trained you...

293
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,564
she expected that I'd fire her.

294
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:38,806
And yet...

295
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,732
What?

296
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,310
I found a letter from her on my suitcase
when I came in last night.

297
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,709
What did it say?

298
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,243
She must have written it
before coming to see me.

299
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,757
Of course.

300
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,865
- Have a nice day.
- You too, ma'am.

301
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,628
I protest! This must change!

302
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,693
Why should you always
get the best piece?

303
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:42,358
I want the heart too!

304
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:45,625
I want it! I pay, for God's sake!

305
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,708
Understand?

306
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:51,001
Who's to thank if you're
able to yell like that today?

307
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,825
Where would you be without me?

308
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:55,640
What about you?

309
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:09,013
Idiot!

310
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:11,060
Can't you lock the door?

311
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,165
You waited until now to do it?
Why not before?

312
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,993
Go on! Hurry up!

313
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:20,121
- They're mine!
- Liar, they're mine! Thief!

314
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:24,215
- You're the thief!
- Help!

315
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:27,351
Let's duke it out!

316
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:29,242
- What's going on?
- They're mine!

317
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,342
What should I do?

318
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:37,875
Get Mr. Flavien.

319
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:39,388
They'll kill each other.

320
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,721
- Where is he?
- In the boiler room, probably.

321
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:55,573
Jules and Pascal are fighting!
They'll kill each other!

322
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,512
Bastard!

323
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,230
Here's the chain-gang!

324
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:18,845
Fascist!

325
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,603
Are you avoiding me
because I scare you?

326
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:34,644
- No, but-
- But what?

327
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,433
The way you treated Jules and Pascal-

328
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:39,421
They're beasts, horrible beasts.

329
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:42,833
- They're old people.
- I'll teach you to recognize them.

330
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,462
Maybe. But I didn't like your violence.

331
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:16,021
Oh! Mr. Jules.

332
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:24,188
I don't want any more fighting.

333
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:28,118
Pascal started it.
He stole my slippers.

334
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:30,357
I'm warning you:

335
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,501
one more fight and I'm leaving.

336
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:34,329
I hate violence.

337
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,469
We are born into violence.

338
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,777
It's everywhere.
Open your eyes.

339
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:40,917
It shouldn't exist here.

340
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:47,321
You're interesting.

341
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:52,853
Of all the girls who've worked here,
you're the only one who cares about us.

342
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,405
What are we, to you?

343
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,253
Men and women
who've worked all their lives...

344
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,099
and who now deserve
rest and tranquillity.

345
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,745
Is Sunday visitors' day?

346
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,461
What visitors?

347
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:12,761
Don't your children visit you?

348
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:14,749
They died a long time ago.

349
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:17,944
Died?

350
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,954
How old are you?

351
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:25,333
What's for dinner?

352
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:29,332
A casserole I invented:
Potatoes, carrots and leeks.

353
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:34,166
I'm surprised that
you're all vegetarians.

354
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,829
Is it a coincidence?

355
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,748
Here, child, drink this.

356
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:47,225
- What is it?
- Something to regenerate your cells.

357
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,147
Do you think I need it?

358
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:53,435
Certainly! Your insides
must be clean and healthy.

359
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,502
- Go on, drink.
- Drink.

360
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,200
That's it!

361
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,438
"My dear Serge...

362
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,858
Just a quick note before bed.
Work is okay.

363
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:12,405
It's easier than I'd thought,
except that I'm busy every second...

364
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,876
because my co-worker left.

365
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:18,137
After eight months of unemployment,
it's good to work again. "

366
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:28,308
Mr. Pascal?

367
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:31,958
I hoped you weren't asleep and...

368
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:36,284
And?

369
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,219
Mr. Pascal!

370
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:46,139
Just a little cuddle.

371
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:47,797
A few minutes.

372
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,748
Really, Mr. Pascal!
Don't be silly.

373
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:52,885
What will the others think?

374
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,739
I like to cuddle and no one
wants to cuddle with me.

375
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:59,282
Okay, but just this once.

376
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,705
But it feels so good!

377
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,941
The heart is gone.

378
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,050
Who stole the heart?

379
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,060
I thought they never ate meat.

380
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,035
Where did it come from?

381
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,955
Thanks, Martine.
I'll take care of it.

382
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,477
That's fine.

383
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:35,061
That's fine, Martine.
My calories are balanced.

384
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:34,457
Did you throw something away
by mistake?

385
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:38,932
- Yes.
- What?

386
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,878
Two pictures of myself.
If you see them-

387
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,664
- Don't worry, I'll give them to you.
- Thank you.

388
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,581
Would you marry a man like me?

389
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:53,467
I don't mean me, but a man like me.

390
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,281
- Why not? If I loved him.
- Thank you.

391
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,444
It's easy to say,
but can you prove it?

392
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:02,645
- Prove what?
- That you love me.

393
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,953
You twist my words, Flavien.

394
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,991
MISS HÉLÈNE ROBERT, 20
1886 BEAUTY QUEEN

395
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:06,516
- Your cleaning is taking forever!
- I'm done.

396
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:10,713
Tell me, dear,
do you enjoy theater?

397
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,812
Yes, I went to see <i>Boeing-Boeing</i>
with the orphanage.

398
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,437
And music,
what sort of music do you like?

399
00:40:17,436 --> 00:40:19,575
The Bee Gees and The Rolling Stones.

400
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:23,412
Good Lord!
Spare me from mediocrity.

401
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,177
Mr. Léon! You and your dumb jokes!
Don't ever do that again!

402
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,202
I'll keep doing it
until the day I die.

403
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:18,203
And that day is far off!

404
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,787
Imbecile!

405
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:52,595
Idiot!

406
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,944
Moron!

407
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,864
Slob!

408
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,169
You're alive today because of me!
Never forget that!

409
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:29,116
Without me,
you'd be rotting in your coffins...

410
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:33,112
so I forbid even the slightest protest.

411
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,349
As for you...

412
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:38,068
no meat for a week.

413
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:40,212
No meat for a week?

414
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:41,877
Hélène, you can't!

415
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:43,868
Have mercy, Hélène.

416
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,160
Please accept my apology.
Forgive me.

417
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:50,487
- Go on, forgive him.
- Forgive him.

418
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,922
I don't like Jules, but...

419
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,014
- We must stick together.
- We must succeed in our attempt!

420
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:58,393
Live for 1,000 years.

421
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,900
I'll forgive you
because we are warriors.

422
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,833
And if one of us falters,
our entire struggle is at risk.

423
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:14,364
Thank you!

424
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,443
Thank you!

425
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,060
- Hello.
- You always surprise me.

426
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:30,328
- I like surprising people.
- You certainly surprise me!

427
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:34,008
Can you mail this?

428
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:36,920
Does it make you sad?

429
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:40,051
I'd rather the letter were for me.

430
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:42,873
- If you want, I'll write to you.
- Thanks.

431
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:47,356
- Have you been delivering here long?
- Two months.

432
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,339
When was the last time
you went to the movies?

433
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:52,153
- A long time ago.
- Want to go?

434
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:54,259
A night out? Why not?
THE GOLDEN NEEDLE KILLER

435
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:56,731
- When?
- In two months.

436
00:46:56,828 --> 00:46:58,868
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

437
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:05,909
By the way, bring apples tomorrow.
I'm almost out.

438
00:47:06,012 --> 00:47:07,573
No problem.

439
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,979
Hello, Mr. Jules. Sleep well?

440
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:16,596
Well, I see the revolutionary sweater
has changed color.

441
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:21,081
- The revolution is in mourning.
- Really?

442
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,587
Why?

443
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,860
They've got nothing!

444
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:53,304
Flavien asks if you have any trash.
The garbage truck is here.

445
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:54,811
I do.

446
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:03,444
Here, Mr. Pascal.
Take this bucket.

447
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,231
If they have ashes, get them for me.

448
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,372
Tell Flavien it's to clean the pots.

449
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:10,843
I love to be given a mission!

450
00:48:26,556 --> 00:48:28,149
THE KILLER'S SIGNATURE

451
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:31,154
A NEEDLE LEFT
IN THE NECK OF HIS VICTIMS

452
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,181
It makes you happy.

453
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,195
Yes.

454
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,861
Very happy.

455
00:48:55,964 --> 00:48:57,786
It reminds me of the orphanage.

456
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,050
Did you like it at the orphanage?

457
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:03,898
That's a good question.

458
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,514
What memories does an orphan have?

459
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:09,876
The orphanage.

460
00:49:11,612 --> 00:49:16,216
I've often asked Flavien
and he never wanted to answer.

461
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:20,694
Oh, I didn't know
Flavien was an orphan.

462
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:24,503
Not that he talks much...

463
00:49:24,604 --> 00:49:26,295
That's true.

464
00:49:27,356 --> 00:49:28,851
Ms. Hélène raised him.

465
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,987
Flavien?

466
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:34,491
Yes.

467
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:39,733
114 YEARS

468
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,162
How old is Ms. Hélène?

469
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,180
I think I'll take a nap.

470
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,187
Keep scrubbing.

471
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:43,956
"... always young women aged 20 to 30. ''

472
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,620
You've nothing to worry about!

473
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,980
"The women are attacked from behind.

474
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:54,679
The madman plunges a golden needle
into the area of their cerebellum.

475
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,537
Then he sexually abuses them
and abandons them in the woods. "

476
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,746
He must have a lot of needles.

477
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,103
They can't be real gold.

478
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:09,204
Who knows. Maybe the killer is rich.

479
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:12,308
- All that glitters is not gold.
- Perhaps you're the killer.

480
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,503
Armand? He'd love to be able
to abuse women!

481
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:19,607
I know who the killer is.

482
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:22,840
It's Flavien.

483
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,762
It's possible.

484
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,176
Where does he go at night?
He goes out every night.

485
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,264
Are you okay?

486
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,747
- What happened?
- You fell off the stepladder.

487
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:50,139
It's due to a vitamin deficiency.
It affects her balance.

488
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,819
You always seem to be
looking for something.

489
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:24,240
I'm not looking for anything.
I simply wanted to raise the heat.

490
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,056
It's at 68 degrees. Isn't that enough?

491
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:37,531
A resident complained.

492
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,351
- Who?
- Pascal.

493
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,859
That's odd. I just saw him
and he didn't mention it.

494
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:45,590
He's afraid of you.

495
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,328
Are you afraid of me?

496
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:51,771
No.

497
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:54,330
I'd like to get to know you.

498
00:53:55,676 --> 00:53:59,473
And you get to know me better
by digging through ashes?

499
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,719
That has nothing to do with it.

500
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:03,859
I'm not so sure.

501
00:54:03,964 --> 00:54:05,371
Meaning?

502
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:09,591
You're looking for something
that I assure you doesn't exist.

503
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:12,059
Since I'm not looking for anything,
it probably doesn't exist.

504
00:54:12,156 --> 00:54:14,043
Exactly.

505
00:54:16,956 --> 00:54:20,753
- Did you know I'm an orphan?
- Yes. Ms. Hélène told me.

506
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,577
Why didn't you say you were, too?

507
00:54:23,676 --> 00:54:26,261
What would be the point?

508
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,601
To establish a contact with me.

509
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:34,040
I doubt you want to establish
a contact simply for me.

510
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:38,262
It's just to get what you're after.

511
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,955
- You're lying, Martine.
- I'm not.

512
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:46,487
I'm just taking an interest in you.

513
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:50,359
- Also, I'm looking for something.
- I know.

514
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,561
I've noticed it for days.

515
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,699
You're different.

516
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,380
Can I know what you're looking for?

517
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:07,702
- Where is Nicole?
- She left, you know that.

518
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:11,156
No one leaves without their suitcase.

519
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,398
Why did you try to burn it?

520
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,060
Why do you have her pen?

521
00:55:15,164 --> 00:55:17,749
Where did the meat I found
in Jules' room come from?

522
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:22,075
You read too many thrillers
as a teenager.

523
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:27,195
Something is going on.

524
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:30,772
I don't know what yet,
but I've got my eyes open.

525
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:34,673
What do you think could go on
in a place like this?

526
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,076
I'll find out.

527
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:57,625
Nicole was nice.

528
00:55:57,723 --> 00:55:59,763
- Did you like her?
- Not really.

529
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:02,234
She was bad at shots.

530
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:04,698
- You have a gentle touch.
- Thanks.

531
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:08,539
- Have you been here long?
- Oh, time...

532
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:11,319
- How long?
- I don't remember.

533
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:15,795
- Have you had many housekeepers?
- I don't remember!

534
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,420
- Done with the shot?
- Yes!

535
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,940
Still trying to establish a contact?

536
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,380
She found a piece of meat
in that fool Jules's room...

537
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:37,371
and knows the other girl
left without her suitcase.

538
00:56:37,468 --> 00:56:38,875
That's all.

539
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,311
- She's asking questions.
- No one will answer.

540
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:47,029
Her questions might
upset the residents.

541
00:56:48,507 --> 00:56:50,809
You're in love with this one, too!

542
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,908
Poor Flavien, you wear
your heart on your sleeve.

543
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,695
We can't fire her now, it's too late.

544
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:59,795
<i>It's almost the 28th. </i>
<i>We're preparing her. </i>

545
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:14,395
I've gained weight.

546
00:57:15,068 --> 00:57:16,856
Your mixture is making me fat!

547
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:19,737
That's good, believe me!
It's better to be envied than pitied.

548
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,396
I don't want it.

549
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:25,712
You're wrong.
It's excellent for your health.

550
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:18,427
Is something wrong?

551
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:20,564
You haven't looked well lately.

552
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:23,476
What day is it?

553
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,996
The 26th.

554
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:28,660
The 26th.

555
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,187
In two days, I'll be strong again.

556
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,803
Why? You'll feel better
after the 28th?

557
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:23,056
- Where are you going?
- To sleep. I'm allowed, aren't I?

558
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:09,303
You had no right to make me so ugly!

559
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:56,721
You never grow old. You never will.

560
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:58,963
I'd like to be old...

561
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,041
very old.

562
01:03:01,563 --> 01:03:04,411
I've got a treat.
Look what I brought you!

563
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:24,859
Nicole.

564
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:53,755
Would you marry a man like me?

565
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:56,851
I didn't say me, but a man like me.

566
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:05,786
What?

567
01:05:07,963 --> 01:05:09,207
No?

568
01:05:12,347 --> 01:05:13,754
Why not?

569
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:16,314
Because I'm too ugly.

570
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:55,222
Poor fool.

571
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:34,041
Tonight.

572
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:08,979
- You're always scaring me!
- I'm sorry.

573
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,643
Do you know what day it is?

574
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:12,438
No.

575
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:14,099
The 28th.

576
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,275
You've been here two months.

577
01:11:16,379 --> 01:11:18,899
Tomorrow night we're going to the movies,
you promised!

578
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:22,298
I'd love to. It will do me good
to get out of here.

579
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:25,113
Are you done?

580
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:26,618
COMPOSITE IMAGE
OF THE GOLDEN NEEDLE KILLER SOON

581
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,121
See you tomorrow night.

582
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,746
I think I already asked:

583
01:11:42,843 --> 01:11:44,883
Would you marry a man like me?

584
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:49,204
Let's leave, Martine!
Let's leave!

585
01:11:49,307 --> 01:11:50,714
Don't you understand?

586
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,658
It's not about your looks.
I don't like you! Got it?

587
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:55,478
Too bad.

588
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:57,139
Why?

589
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:00,946
Too bad.

590
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:07,993
Usually, the difficult part
is dragging them here.

591
01:14:19,387 --> 01:14:20,947
I already asked you:

592
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:24,051
- Would you marry a man like me?
- Murderer!

593
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,905
Murderer!

594
01:16:09,978 --> 01:16:11,539
The phone, please.

595
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:14,520
I need to make a call!

596
01:16:37,019 --> 01:16:38,742
- Hello, Serge?
- <i>Yes?</i>

597
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:40,403
It's Martine.

598
01:16:40,507 --> 01:16:43,027
- Come quickly, they're eating us!
- <i>What?</i>

599
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,775
- It's awful, I ran away!
- <i>You ran away?</i>

600
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,697
They're all totally crazy!

601
01:16:48,795 --> 01:16:51,162
- <i>Did you call the police?</i>
- The line was busy.

602
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:54,041
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- The café on the corner.

603
01:16:54,138 --> 01:16:56,691
<i>Stay calm and don't leave. </i>
<i>I'll come get you. </i>

604
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:58,998
<i>Whatever you do, don't leave. </i>
<i>I'm coming. </i>

605
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:00,276
Hurry!

606
01:17:16,314 --> 01:17:16,914
Roll.

607
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:26,360
Your turn.

608
01:17:37,594 --> 01:17:39,417
FOR MY BELOVED NICOLE...

609
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,650
MAURICE

610
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:54,608
- Your fiancé's not bad!
- Give it back.

611
01:17:56,794 --> 01:17:58,682
"For my beloved Nicole, Maurice. "

612
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:01,521
Maurice is one lucky guy.

613
01:18:24,091 --> 01:18:27,887
- Need a ride?
- The police station. Quick!

614
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,256
- Police?
- Hurry, it's a matter of life and death!

615
01:19:00,538 --> 01:19:01,945
It's not all there.

616
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:04,976
Yes, it is. As usual.

617
01:19:05,082 --> 01:19:06,642
The price has gone up.

618
01:19:07,226 --> 01:19:08,633
Don't you think that's pushing it?

619
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,959
What about the risks I take
for this bullshit of yours?

620
01:19:12,058 --> 01:19:14,676
They're the same,
regardless of the price.

621
01:19:17,306 --> 01:19:20,502
Money always helps.

622
01:19:22,138 --> 01:19:23,927
Especially when one decides
to do nothing.

623
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,546
Oh, please...

624
01:19:27,386 --> 01:19:29,241
eternal youth is priceless.

625
01:19:32,474 --> 01:19:34,034
You'll grow old, too.

626
01:19:35,035 --> 01:19:36,595
I'll move in here.

627
01:19:41,594 --> 01:19:44,115
- Is the next one ready for tomorrow?
- Yes.

628
01:19:44,218 --> 01:19:46,258
But at double the price, in cash.

629
01:19:52,378 --> 01:19:53,938
Go get her.

630
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:56,754
Hélène.

631
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:43,285
Help!

632
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,414
Help!

633
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:46,106
Don't hide.

634
01:21:48,218 --> 01:21:49,844
Look at me...

635
01:21:51,482 --> 01:21:53,304
straight in the eyes.

636
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,342
You tried to make me ugly.

637
01:21:57,338 --> 01:21:58,582
Go!

638
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:20,982
You're my friend. Save me.

639
01:22:21,082 --> 01:22:23,602
You are necessary.

640
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,850
The revolution...

641
01:23:32,954 --> 01:23:35,289
One child, one old person...

642
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,730
I'm your friend.

643
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:35,093
I know we're monsters.

644
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:37,398
But when you think about it...

645
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:40,465
no worse than those living in the city.

646
01:24:41,146 --> 01:24:42,073
No worse.

647
01:24:49,498 --> 01:24:53,208
She's my Martine. Forever.

648
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:14,833
Hélène, you lost.

649
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:18,194
You lost.

650
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,937
So this is Death...

651
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:26,869
the Big Sleep.

652
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:32,502
I was never ugly...

653
01:26:33,882 --> 01:26:35,704
just useless.

654
01:27:24,858 --> 01:27:32,408
<i>There are veils one lifts</i>

655
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:39,184

660
01:28:09,562 --> 01:28:15,923
<i>She saw Death</i>

661
01:28:16,025 --> 01:28:22,703
<i>And she knew Death</i>

662
01:28:23,962 --> 01:28:26,198
<i>Its secret</i>

663
01:28:27,354 --> 01:28:33,649
<i>Her innocence</i>

664
01:28:33,753 --> 01:28:37,049
<i>Condemned her</i>

665
01:28:37,882 --> 01:28:41,330
<i>To Death</i>

666
01:28:41,433 --> 01:28:43,637
