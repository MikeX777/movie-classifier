1
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,930
<i>? There's a story you should know
from 100 years ago</i>

2
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>? And 100 years
we've waited now to tell</i>

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>? Now the Yankees come along
and they'll listen to this song</i>

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>? And they'll quake in fear
to hear this rebel yell</i>

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,360
<i>? And they'll quake in fear
to hear this rebel yell</i>

6
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,490
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,290
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,120
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,460
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

10
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,100
<i>? Robert E. Lee broke
his musket on his knee</i>

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>? And 1,000 pieces
shattered on the ground</i>

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,650
<i>? But he looked up then
and he gathered up his men</i>

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,820
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,150
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,320
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,490
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,790
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,850
<i>? Stonewall took a gun
and he made the Yankees run</i>

20
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,190
<i>? But he took a fatal bullet in the chest</i>

21
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,740
<i>? As he fell down dead old Stonewall said,
I'm a-givin' you a dying man's request</i>

22
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
<i>? I'm a-givin' you a dying man's request</i>

23
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,410
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

24
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,040
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,630
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,980
<i>? Jeb Stuart spurred his horse
and the Yankees run of course</i>

28
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,270
<i>? But there wasn't any powder for his gun</i>

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,440
<i>? So he said to his boys
Let's make a lot of noise</i>

30
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,700
<i>? And we'll charge again
and make them Yankees run</i>

31
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,490
<i>? And we'll charge again
and make them Yankees run</i>

32
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,200
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,040
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,300
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,940
<i>? Robert E. Lee broke
his musket on his knee</i>

37
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,270
<i>? And 1,000 pieces
shattered on the ground</i>

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,740
<i>? But he looked up then
and he gathered up his men</i>

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,990
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

40
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,450
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,620
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,170
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,960
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

45
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,690
<i>? There's a story you should know
from 100 years ago</i>

46
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,900
<i>? And 100 years
we've waited now to tell</i>

47
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,080
<i>? And they'll quake in fear
to hear this rebel yell</i>

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

49
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,960
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,840
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

51
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,990
Now, what do you think this means?

52
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,490
Well, it means detour, lady.

53
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,620
And this looks like a lousy road.

54
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,120
Well, I don't know.

55
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,790
I don't like the looks of this.

56
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,750
It doesn't say how far the detour goes.

57
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,670
Well, want me to drive?

58
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm more than just a hitchhiker, you know.

59
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,670
I just happen to be a schoolteacher
who happened to have a little car trouble.

60
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,800
And it's lucky for me.

61
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Yeah.

62
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,180
Well, don't make me feel sorry
I picked you up back there.

63
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,060
From the looks of this, you just might
be glad before the trip's over.

64
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,760
Bring 'em on down here.

65
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,720
Bring 'em way on down.

66
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,560
Get 'em right here
in the middle of Pleasant Valley.

67
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Come on, bring 'em on down.

68
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,730
Come on!

69
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,610
Come on!

70
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,410
Right here. Come on. Come on.

71
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,410
Yeehaw!

72
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,540
Y'all get back a little bit.

73
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,790
Y'all get back just a little bit.

74
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,490
- That kid!
- Get out of here, you little creep.

75
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,430
You all clear out of here, Billy, hear.

76
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,270
I'm Earl Buckman, mayor of this here town.

77
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,820
The great little town of Pleasant Valley.

78
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,820
- Y'all travelin'?
- Why, yes, Mr. Buckman.

79
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,030
We're on our way to Florida.

80
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,280
Y'all on vacation?

81
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,090
Wait a minute.
Just what's going on here anyway?

82
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,820
Are we under arrest or something?

83
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,430
I mean, what the hell's going on here?

84
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,780
Where are we anyway?

85
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,790
You just keep your pants on, boy.

86
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,460
You're not under arrest.

87
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,960
You're right smack dab
in the middle of Pleasant Valley.

88
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,630
Isn't he, folks?

89
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,880
I'll tell you this much, though.
We've been waiting on you.

90
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,140
Ain't that right, folks?

91
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,640
What do you mean,
you've been waiting for us?

92
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,350
Why, you pretty little Yankee gal.

93
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,390
I didn't say "waiting for you,"
I said "waiting on you."

94
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
What?

95
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,740
Well, I better get to the point.

96
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,620
We 'uns here in Pleasant Valley
are celebrating a little old centennial.

97
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,210
Yes, sir, we are.

98
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,340
And you folks are the guests of honor.
Now, how about that?

99
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,260
Yeah.

100
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,680
I am not sure I understand, Mr. Buckman.

101
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,760
Well, then, you better listen
carefully this time.

102
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,140
We're celebrating something
that happened over 100 years ago.

103
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,020
It's a big deal around here.

104
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,150
And part of the ceremony
is we get us some strangers from up north.

105
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,520
You get everything free.

106
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,940
It's an honor, damn it.

107
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,820
Now, you come on out of there for a second.

108
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeehaw!

109
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,370
Welcome to the Pleasant Valley.

110
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,540
By dinghy.

111
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,540
We got ourselves
some more visitors for the centennial.

112
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,540
That makes six. Yeah!

113
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,000
Billy, you go tell Lester and Rufe

114
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,630
we got ourselves the guests of
honor for the centennial

115
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,840
and we don't need us no more. Go.

116
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,470
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

117
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,560
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

118
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,100
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

119
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,850
Well, what's the matter?

120
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,730
Well, ain't nothing the matter, miss.

121
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,360
Everything's fine. Just fine.

122
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,820
More Yankees
for the centennial, huh, Mayor?

123
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,070
That's right, mister.

124
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,950
Well, now, miss, you and
your mister here...

125
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,490
He's not my mister.

126
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,410
He's a perfect stranger named Tom White.

127
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,540
Oh, well, now, Miss...

128
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,790
Adams. Terry Adams.

129
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,710
Well, Miss Adams, if you know his name,
he's not a perfect stranger now, is he?

130
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,470
My name is John Miller, Miss Adams

131
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,840
and if you'd like, I'll be glad to take on
this, this hitchhiker for you.

132
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,270
And I'm Bea Miller, Tom.
I'm married to that animal.

133
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,730
Don't worry, you can always
hitch a ride with me.

134
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,190
Our guest's a rotten egg, though,
ain't he folks?

135
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,530
Say, uh, would I sound stupid and ungracious
if I asked what this is all about?

136
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,740
I'm David Wells and this
is my wife Beverly.

137
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,200
I am not quite sure, Mr. White,

138
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
but it looks like we're guests of honor
at this centennial.

139
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,460
Us?

140
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,120
Well, why are we guests of honor?

141
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,670
Can't think of a prettier
guest of honor than you,

142
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,590
you big, handsome Yankee, you.

143
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,640
You're blushing.

144
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,100
Why not relax and enjoy it?

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,260
Okay.

146
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,470
I will if you will.

147
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,070
Ahem. Will our guests of honor
come right over here?

148
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,030
Now, some of our guests ain't sure yet
what this shindig's all about.

149
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,410
So we better get started with
our centennial. Right, folks?

150
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,910
Yeah!

151
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,330
Yes, siree!

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,370
Now, it's been 100 years.

153
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,920
But what we're celebrating ain't important.

154
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,170
What we need are guests of honor
and you all are it.

155
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,510
Now, for the next two days,
y'all are gonna be guests of the town.

156
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,140
You're gonna have the best hotel rooms,

157
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,680
the best food,

158
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,100
the best entertainment
and it's all on the house.

159
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,310
Yes, sir, you're all are our guests.

160
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,270
And we're gonna show you
some Southern hospitality.

161
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,030
I reckon this here's one celebration y'all
are gonna remember as long as you live.

162
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,870
Yeah! Won't it, folks?

163
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,080
Yeah, here's two fellas
I want you all to know.

164
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,960
This here is Rufus Tate.

165
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,840
And this here is Lester MacDonald.

166
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,350
Rufus here is head-man of this celebration.

167
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,720
He's general chairman.

168
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,560
And Lester here, he's program chairman.

169
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,320
I reckon everybody know these fellas
pretty good, ain't they folks?

170
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,360
We got us some good 'uns.

171
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,860
Dogged if we don't.

172
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,160
Now, we got us a big barbecue
to start things off tonight.

173
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,220
Hey, Earl, what do you say
we get our guests down in the hotel,

174
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,550
so they can get in good shape
for that barbecue.

175
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,720
That's a good idea, Lester.
Let's get 'em checked in.

176
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,890
- Say, Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah, what is it, son?

177
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,770
Well, we'd like to stay
for your celebration,

178
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,730
but Miss Adams and I have to be getting on.

179
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,860
He's not only a hitchhiker,
he's a party pooper.

180
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,740
Y'all want to leave? You can't!

181
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,530
Of course not.

182
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,080
Only two days.
You'll have the time of your life.

183
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,510
Thought y'all didn't know each other.

184
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,020
But they ain't gonna leave, are they?

185
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,710
Of course not. I'll tell you what.

186
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,630
You got someplace else to be, is that it?

187
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,590
Well, uh, I'm due
in a teachers' convention in Atlanta.

188
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,880
Tell you what.

189
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,530
We went through a lot of trouble
to get you all here.

190
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,140
- We don't give up so easy.
- You can say that again, Earl.

191
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,700
Yeah, as soon as you get to the hotel,

192
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,390
y'all send 'em a wire, tell 'em
y'all be there in a couple of days.

193
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,230
We'll even pay for the
wire, won't we, folks?

194
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,540
Hey, Rufe, you think we ought to go out and
get us a couple of special guests of honor?

195
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,000
Lester, we got us six.
Just the right number.

196
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,750
Y'all know the rules of the celebration.

197
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,050
Got us six Yankees and, boy,

198
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,720
we're gonna have a centennial celebration
to make old Robert E. Lee hisself proud.

199
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah, but we could slip back
and get us some more

200
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,730
and kind of have our own
private centennial.

201
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,440
Hot dog! Lester, aren't you the sneaky one?

202
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,980
Maybe we could get us
a couple of, uh, private guests.

203
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,450
Now, boys, you know
all the rules of the centennial.

204
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,530
Sure wouldn't look good for the
general chairman and the program chairman

205
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,830
to be in business for theirselves,
now, would it?

206
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,870
Now, now, we need six guests
and we got us six.

207
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,620
Enough fun for everybody.

208
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,290
Now, tonight's the big barbecue
and we need the special guest.

209
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,960
Now, which one of the six you all want?

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,220
Uh, let's get us one of them gals!

211
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,090
Yeah! That there big
blonde 'un'd be perfect!

212
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,510
Yeah!

213
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,430
All right, Lester, you're
the head-man tonight.

214
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,990
- Here's a suggestion though.
- All right.

215
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,480
That little old gal, she seems to like
Harper Alexander.

216
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,820
And her husband,
he don't mind looking at Betsy Gunther,

217
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,570
so you have Betsy entertain him,

218
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,400
and old Harper, he can take
that little old gal on a walk

219
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,200
and get her ready for the barbecue!

220
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,660
Wow! Yeehaw!

221
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,650
Such a strange little affair.

222
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
It's almost like Halloween.

223
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,200
This is better than Halloween!

224
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,410
Looks like John C. Calhoun's version
of trick-or-treat.

225
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,500
Why, yeah.

226
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,340
We gonna provide the tricks

227
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,760
and them folks up there,
they're gonna provide the treat.

228
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,680
Isn't this the damnedest thing
that's ever happened to us.

229
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,770
Johnny boy, the world we live,

230
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,480
everything that happens
is the damnedest thing.

231
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,030
Well, honey, you've got to admit, all this,
and we're the guests of honor.

232
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,910
And it's free, too.

233
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,450
Yeah. Including this room at the Waldorf.

234
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,590
Hmm. Old Johnny boy
was watching when that...

235
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,010
That backwoods Daniel Boone
was working on your leg.

236
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,640
Who does he think he is anyway?

237
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,770
Stonewall Jackson's razor blade salesman?

238
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,400
Or maybe he just thought you were
a little puppy dog that needed petting.

239
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,270
Well, his name is Harper.

240
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,530
And for an Arkansas wood-chopper,
he has mighty smooth hands.

241
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,830
What about you
and that overblown Daisy May?

242
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,410
That eyeball treatment usually means
they're steam-heating your radiator.

243
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,870
Johnny boy knows his way around.

244
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,630
Well, honey, you know
you're my one and only.

245
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,260
What you mean is
I haven't caught up with you yet.

246
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,680
Oh, well, come to Mama.

247
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh!

248
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,850
Must be Jeb Davis.

249
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,240
- General Grant's headquarters.
- Johnny, don't do that.

250
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,530
Yeah, I'm only kidding.

251
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,320
This is John Miller speaking.

252
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,990
Yeah.

253
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,330
Who?

254
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,000
I said, a young lady'd like to speak to you
if y'all wait just a second.

255
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,460
You do it right, Betsy, here.

256
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
Hello, Mr. Miller?

257
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,010
This here's Betsy Gunther.

258
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,680
We sort of met, if you know what I mean,
this afternoon.

259
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,360
And I figured your wife might be tired
and I might show you around the town.

260
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,690
Hmm?

261
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,820
How would you like that?

262
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,650
Huh?

263
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,910
Yeah.

264
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,950
Yeah, that'd be fun.

265
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,410
Good idea.

266
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,080
When?

267
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Right now?

268
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,960
Well, uh, if he wants to see me.

269
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
No, no, I won't keep him waiting.

270
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,850
Yeah.

271
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,720
Tell him I'll be right down.

272
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,230
Right.

273
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,020
Honey, that was the mayor.

274
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,900
You know, that Buckman character.

275
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,650
He wants to see me.

276
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,530
I better not keep him waiting.

277
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,740
Are you sure that wasn't
the voice of Bugle Ann?

278
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,750
Now, who the hell are you?
Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover?

279
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,830
No, sweetie.

280
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,380
Mrs. Johnny Boy Casanova,
who warns her little boy blue

281
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,880
that anything you can do I can do better.

282
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,090
That's why I stick to you.

283
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,610
Hi.

284
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,650
You know, I was sort of thinking,

285
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,330
if we're gonna look over the town,
why don't we start with Lover's Lane?

286
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,870
Mr. Miller, I declare.

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,840
You're so clever.

288
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,500
Clever.

289
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,810
Harper, boy, I got a feeling that
you're gonna have more fun

290
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,390
than a beagle dog on a coon hunt.

291
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
- You all go make that call, hear.
- Yeah.

292
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,750
Anybody wanna make a bet?

293
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,920
Go ahead, ring it.

294
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,500
Okay, Harper.

295
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Hello, Mrs. Miller?

296
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,270
Just a moment please, I
have a call for you.

297
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Go ahead, Harper.

298
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,940
Hello. Is this Mrs. Miller?

299
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,200
Mrs. Miller, this is Harper Alexander.

300
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,280
We sort of met a little
earlier this afternoon.

301
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,870
They gonna get
a lot better acquainted, I bet.

302
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,500
Well, I'm rather flattered
you remember, Mrs. Miller.

303
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,420
It was only for a minute.

304
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,970
But I sure remember you, all right.

305
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,050
You was that pretty one.

306
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,180
Huh?

307
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,390
Sure. I'll call you Bea.

308
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,270
My name's Harper.

309
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,860
Well, if you're on the official
welcoming committee, I guess it would be...

310
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,070
Oh, Johnny'll be gone
for a couple of hours.

311
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,240
Well, uh...

312
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,370
Why, Harper.

313
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,620
Well, I wouldn't want you to look bad
with the welcoming committee.

314
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,920
You'll have me back in time
for the barbecue now, won't you?

315
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,800
Why, Bea, honey.

316
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,260
Y'all won't miss the barbecue.

317
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,340
I guarantee you, you'll be there.

318
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,720
Five minutes?

319
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,770
I'll meet y'all in the lobby.

320
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,600
What'd she say?

321
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,650
She don't want to miss the barbecue.

322
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,360
Well, boy, if she ain't there,
there ain't gonna be no barbecue.

323
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Phew.

324
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,940
Wow. Give me those country boys every time.

325
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,870
Bea, I reckon you're the prettiest gal
I've ever seen.

326
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,300
Uh, tell me something, Harper.

327
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,010
What do you do when
you're not having centennials?

328
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,680
Let me show you something.

329
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,560
Feel that blade.

330
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,270
What for, honey?

331
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,570
Why don't you feel that sharp edge?
Go ahead, feel it now.

332
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,620
Ow!

333
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,540
You backwoods hayseed, you!

334
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,370
I'm bleeding!

335
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,790
- Wait.
- Do something, damn it!

336
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,460
- I'll fix it. I'll fix it. Give me the...
- Oh, I'm bleeding all over the place!

337
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,380
- Help me!
- I'll fix it. I'll fix it.

338
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,970
- Don't worry now.
- No, no, no!

339
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,970
Don't want you to get sick.

340
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,610
I told y'all that blade was sharp.

341
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,320
Now, I'm sure sorry to hear that.

342
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,490
I'm a doctor. Let me have a look at that.

343
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,330
Miss Bea.

344
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,410
- I'm afraid this looks serious.
- Ow!

345
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,410
It's gonna cost you
some serious surgery, Miss Bea.

346
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,620
No! No!

347
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,920
Now, now. I'm a doctor. You hold still.
This'll all be over in a minute.

348
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,920
Get the boys in here. Come on.

349
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,930
Hey, Lester, Rufe, come on in here.

350
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,930
- You hold her down.
- No! Oh!

351
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,690
I reckon we got ourselves
the bacon of the barbecue!

352
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,320
- Who is it?
- Tom White, I'd like to talk to you.

353
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,700
Just a minute.

354
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,590
What's the matter?

355
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,680
You know as well as I do

356
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,100
there's something phony
about this centennial.

357
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,430
What do you mean?

358
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,900
You're just imagining things.

359
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,520
They are treating us like kings and queens.

360
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,400
And we're the guests of honor.

361
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,530
Yes, but why?

362
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,700
Has it occurred to you that nobody has told
us what this centennial is all about?

363
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,330
Now this is 1965.

364
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,420
And 100 years ago it was 1865, right?

365
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,420
So?
What happened in 1865, Terry?

366
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,800
Uh...

367
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,720
It was the end of the Civil War.

368
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,390
The war between the states.

369
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,310
Well, then you tell me
why would a Southern town

370
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,600
want Northerners
as guests of honor at a centennial?

371
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,940
It must have had something
to do with the war 100 years ago.

372
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,610
So, something's very wrong in this town.

373
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,070
Well, what should we do?

374
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Something I should've done hours ago.

375
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,410
See, there's a teachers'
convention in Atlanta.

376
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,950
Starts in a couple of days, too.

377
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,580
And I know that some of the people
are already there.

378
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,920
Say, I'll put in a call to someone I know

379
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,250
and he's a specialist in
American history, too.

380
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,630
Then I'll tell him what's going on

381
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,920
and if he can't give me the answers,

382
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,930
then at least he can know where we're at.

383
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,140
And, well, if something's wrong,

384
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,390
that's powerful ammunition.

385
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,900
Uh, operator, I would like to make
a long distance call, please.

386
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,620
What do you mean I can't make
a long distance call on this phone?

387
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,450
It's the hotel rule.

388
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,580
Well, can I send a telegram then?

389
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,300
Well, how do I get word
out of Pleasant Valley?

390
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,130
No, no. Never mind. Thank you.

391
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,070
You know, I can't make an issue out of this

392
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,100
because if I do,
they'll know something's wrong.

393
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,190
Hmm...

394
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,520
Say, have you got any change?

395
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,480
I think so. Why?

396
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,320
Well, there must be
a pay telephone in this town.

397
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,870
I'll find it and I'll make that call
even if I have to disguise my voice.

398
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,240
Here.

399
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,550
Hello, this is Mr. Scray.

400
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,850
I'm puttin' in a call
to my cousin George Markham.

401
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,850
Uh, yes, he's at the
Tower Hotel in Atlanta.

402
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,190
No, I don't know the number.

403
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,570
Ah, yes, uh, I know he's there,
so just give me the hotel, please.

404
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,030
Uh, yessum.

405
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,240
Huh? Uh, this here number is, uh, 727-Jane.

406
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,870
Yessum, thank you, ma'am.

407
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,120
All right, ma'am.

408
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,050
Thank you, ma'am.

409
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,470
Yes, ma'am. Y'all are welcome.

410
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,720
Hello, is this the Tower...

411
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,520
Excuse me,
is this the Tower hotel?

412
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,150
All right. Would you please connect me
with Dr. George Markham?

413
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,020
Please, yes.

414
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,820
George Markham.

415
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,780
He's from Chicago.
He's there for the teachers' convention.

416
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,240
Yes.

417
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,080
He's not... But he must be registered.

418
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,460
Well, I know he is...

419
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,580
Well, yes, let me
speak to the manager, please.

420
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,050
Say, is this the manager?

421
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,260
I want to talk to Dr. George Markham
from Chicago.

422
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,640
Well, I know he's registered there.

423
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,060
Oh? Not until tomorrow?

424
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:31,100
Well, I'll tell you,
would you let me talk to, well, anyone.

425
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,440
Yes, involved in the registration
for the teachers' convention.

426
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,780
None of them until tomorrow?

427
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,450
Say, are you sure this is the Tower Hotel?

428
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,780
Say, look. This is extremely urgent.

429
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,290
Yes. When Mr. Markham checks in,
tell him to call a Mr. White.

430
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:57,040
That's Mr. White, and I'll give you the
name of the hotel that I'm staying in. Yes.

431
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,590
Could you please put this down?
Have you got a pencil?

432
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,230
Yes, well, now here's what you tell him.

433
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:17,860
Yes, sir, Mr. White,

434
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll gladly send your message.

435
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,490
Just as far...

436
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,950
Just as far...

437
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,500
as I can fly it.

438
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,330
? You were walking in the street
with another man

439
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,370
? You wouldn't even post my bail

440
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,010
? Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

441
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,180
? Gonna lay around the shack
till the mail train comes back

442
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,430
? I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

443
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,780
? Well, I ain't gonna work on the railroad

444
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,200
? I ain't gonna work on the farm

445
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,080
? Gonna lay around the shack
till the mail train comes back

446
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,750
? I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

447
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,840
? I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms

448
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,130
? Gonna lay around the shack
till the mail train comes back

449
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,010
Whoo!

450
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,390
Yes, sir.

451
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,810
I have a few more guests
here for the centennial

452
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
and you know why they're here.

453
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,280
Let's give 'em a great big welcome.
What do you say?

454
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,240
All right!

455
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,580
Now, let's have a little more guitar music!

456
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,620
What happened to John and Bea?

457
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,170
Well, Bea must've found
herself another man.

458
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,300
She usually does.

459
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,170
But I see John
and he's in his usual good form, too.

460
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,300
He is.

461
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,430
Ooh!

462
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,600
What have you got in this, mule...
It has a mule kick. Ugh.

463
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,060
What's the matter, Johnny boy?

464
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,600
Can't hold your liquor?

465
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,650
I'll show you.

466
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,690
Pour me another bit of
that white lightning.

467
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,900
No, no, no. Give me the whole bottle.

468
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,990
Ugh.

469
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,000
Listen, you ain't seen
my wife around, have you?

470
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,830
Even if I have,

471
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,460
she ain't seen us.

472
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,260
- Mr. Buckman.
- Hmm?

473
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,350
What is that on that spit over there?

474
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,930
Oh, that's nothing.
That's just part of the centennial.

475
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,440
Uh, symbolic, I think
that's the word that it is.

476
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,360
I don't think you ever explained to me
just what the centennial was all about.

477
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,780
Well, it's a surprise.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

478
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,360
Say, where's that young fella of yours?

479
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,030
- Tom?
- Yeah.

480
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,490
I wish I knew.

481
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,540
And by the way, he's not my young fellow.

482
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,540
Come on, now.

483
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,830
I know you two are sweet on each other.

484
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,170
We're sort of hoping that we can have
an engagement party

485
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,670
as a climax to the centennial.

486
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,460
- Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah.

487
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,130
I hardly know him.

488
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,090
His car broke down and I gave him a lift.

489
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,930
We were going in the same direction.

490
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,720
Well, he's a nice young fella,
ain't he?

491
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,390
Yes, he is.

492
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,060
A very nice fellow.

493
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,730
Lester and me can't find him no how.

494
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,890
What? What does it mean?

495
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,640
It means this centennial
is the centennial of blood vengeance.

496
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,480
It means that...

497
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,690
It means we're here to be killed.

498
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,480
Come on, fast!

499
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,030
Come on, Earl, we got to find 'em.

500
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,860
Must be around here someplace.

501
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,450
They can't get far.

502
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,500
Oh, forget it.

503
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,260
- Let's get back to the horse race.
- All right.

504
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,570
Come on, honey.

505
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,880
Folks, if y'all excuse me.

506
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm supposed to take you
back to your hotel.

507
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,550
We got us some
mighty big plans for tomorrow

508
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,260
and you're gonna need your sleep.

509
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,390
Well, thank you very much, Harper.

510
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,520
Why, not at all. My pleasure.

511
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,900
What about him?

512
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,830
Well, ma'am,
y'all don't need to worry about him.

513
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,080
We're going to take care of him, too.

514
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
Mr. Miller.

515
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,960
Y'all wake up, hear, boy.

516
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,260
Huh?

517
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,300
What?

518
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,640
Where's Betsy? Where's Bea?

519
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,390
You ever been to a horse race, boy, huh?

520
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,230
- Horse race?
- Y'all's gonna be in a horse race.

521
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,860
It's part of the centennial.

522
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,570
I don't know how to ride.

523
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,440
Boy, to be in this race,
you don't have to know how to ride.

524
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,200
All you gotta do is know how to pray.

525
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,290
Hey, come on.

526
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,550
Grab him, boys.

527
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,480
Here's your new girlfriend, Johnny boy.

528
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,940
I'm just gonna put that there.

529
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,790
That's it. Tie him up good there, Lester.

530
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,300
I got him, Rufe. I got him.

531
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,420
Tie him up.

532
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,010
Wait a minute. Hold on, everybody.

533
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,890
It's just this ain't much of a horse race

534
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,530
- unless he's awake.
- Hey, you're right.

535
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
Yeah.

536
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,730
- OK, fetch me some water.
- Get some water.

537
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,410
Your horse race is about
ready to start, boy.

538
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,740
And you're gonna ride four horses.

539
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,160
- Yeah.
- Four horses?

540
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,620
Yeah, and they all gonna be goin'
in four different directions.

541
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,210
Bye, Johnny boy.

542
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,920
Enjoy the race.

543
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,930
No, no.

544
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,310
Ha! Ha! Get up there.

545
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,510
No.

546
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,140
Ha! Ha!

547
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,350
No!

548
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,030
Let's hear us some music.

549
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,780
I said let's hear us some music.

550
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,530
This is our celebration.

551
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,200
You know what happens to
anybody that backs out.

552
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,040
So let's hear us some music.

553
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,090
? Look away, look away

554
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,840
? Look away Dixie Land

555
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,970
? In Dixie's Land, where I was born in

556
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,560
? Early on one frosty mornin'

557
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,850
? Look away, look away

558
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,400
? Look away Dixie Land

559
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,520
? I wish I was in Dixie

560
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,780
? Hooray! Hooray!

561
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,570
? In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand

562
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,530
? To live and die in Dixie

563
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,830
? Away, away
Away down south in Dixie

564
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,560
? Oh the first time I seen darlin' Cory

565
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,270
? She was standin' by the sea

566
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:01,730
? Had a.45 strapped around her bosom, Lord

567
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,030
? Had a banjo on her knee

568
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,080
? Get away, get away

569
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,330
? Darlin' Cory

570
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,000
? Quit hanging around my bed

571
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,380
David, wake up.

572
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,810
David, there's something
so unwholesome about this centennial.

573
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,850
What's it all about?

574
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,480
I don't know.

575
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,230
But I keep getting the feeling
we're being separated from the others.

576
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,540
Would you ring Mr. and Mrs. Miller's room
for me please?

577
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,630
Oh.

578
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,130
Then how about, uh, Mr. White?

579
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,430
He is?

580
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,720
Well, then would you ring
Miss Adams' room for me?

581
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,850
I see.

582
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,560
You don't know when they'll be back?

583
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,570
Thank you. Uh?

584
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,780
Oh, yes, we slept well, thank you.

585
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,700
Beverly, we better get dressed and clear
out as soon as John and Bea get back.

586
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,870
The desk says they're out for a walk.

587
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,460
And the other two, uh,
Tom White and Terry Adams,

588
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,000
they're out for a walk, too.

589
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,090
What time is it?

590
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,000
It's only 8:00.

591
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,760
Well, have you ever known Johnny boy
to get up before 10:00?

592
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,320
And in the condition he was in last night,

593
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,680
it'd be a miracle if he
were up before noon.

594
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,230
And if he did get up, he sure
wouldn't feel like going for a walk.

595
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,190
Judging from yesterday,

596
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,980
even if everything else were true,

597
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,940
John certainly won't be taking
a walk with his own wife.

598
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,690
Let's get dressed.

599
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,330
It sure was a mighty fine
horse race last night.

600
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,210
Hey, Earl, today is gonna be even better

601
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:31,180
because the program committee have
put together a mighty fine show.

602
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,890
Boys, I am a little worried
about this here school teacher.

603
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,810
He don't like us none.

604
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,480
He gonna like us even less
after tonight though.

605
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,520
- Is he in his room?
- Yeah.

606
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,770
He didn't even spend much time with
his gal after they got back.

607
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,650
I don't want him wandering around though.

608
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,570
Watch him close, yeah?

609
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,700
Yeah, I... I wouldn't mind watching
that Terry Adams.

610
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,420
That's one Yankee girl
that's got a lot of class.

611
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:09,710
By night, all that class

612
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,300
gonna be drained out of her, Lester.

613
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,930
Here they come right now.

614
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,890
Morning, folks.

615
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,060
Hope y'all enjoyed your breakfast.

616
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,440
We are your official escorts today.

617
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,020
What happened to Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

618
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,280
Why, now they is out on a nice boat ride.

619
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,150
Y'all get to go real soon.

620
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,260
But why can't Beverly come with me?

621
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,430
Now, Mr. Wells, I told you Mrs. Wells

622
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,310
was going on a scenic tour.

623
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,180
Well, why can't we be together?

624
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,350
You wouldn't wanna ruin
the centennial, would you?

625
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,650
Now be a good sport and come on
with me to the barrel roll.

626
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,530
You're the guest of honor.

627
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,150
What's a barrel roll?

628
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,490
Come on, we gonna start
as soon as you get there.

629
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,420
Lester,

630
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,510
show this little old Yankee boy
this, the barrel roll devil.

631
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,680
All right, Lester, all right.

632
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,140
There's nothing to it.

633
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,350
Now, we is gonna roll this
barrel down to the bottom of the hill

634
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,180
and you is gonna be in.

635
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,350
Yeah.

636
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,190
- That's all?
- Yup.

637
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,360
Oh, exceptin' for one thing you gotta do.

638
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,740
It's a tradition.

639
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,910
You gotta crawl through this here barrel.

640
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,070
Yeah.

641
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,040
What for? I had rather not.
I have a stiff knee.

642
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,290
- Aww.
- Listen, you got to crawl through.

643
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,710
Do you hear me? You got to.

644
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,340
If you don't, we can help.

645
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,390
Come on, get down there.

646
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,600
Stop that, stop that!

647
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,850
Take it easy, will you?

648
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,690
You'll just spoil the
ceremony, like Earl said.

649
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,780
- Yeah.
- Get me out of here.

650
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,230
Now you stop that.

651
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,160
Stop that thrashing around,
you might get hurt.

652
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,110
I said let him go for a second.

653
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,160
I said listen.

654
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,200
What kind of nonsense is this?
Let me out of here.

655
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,580
It's all part of the ceremony.

656
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,660
- Now, you listen here.
- Hear what he said?

657
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,430
We're gonna do something
to this barrel now.

658
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,080
You be still or you might get hurt now.

659
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,460
Don't move now. We're going to start.

660
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:09,940
Make sure he doesn't get out.

661
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,450
Everybody ready for the barrel roll?

662
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,770
We're ready.

663
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,270
Everybody, here we go.

664
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,110
Doggone if this ain't
the best centennial anybody ever had.

665
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,770
Mornin', Mr. White.

666
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,310
Uh, mornin'.

667
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,190
I'll just be out and
about in about a minute.

668
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,410
They're all out?

669
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,420
Mr. White, too?

670
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,050
OK. Thank you.

671
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,650
- Uh, excuse me, sir.
- Huh?

672
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,990
Could you help me for a minute?

673
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,660
I can't turn off the water in the bathroom.

674
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,740
All right, all right.

675
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,960
Where is it?

676
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,420
Come on. I'll show you.

677
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,590
Get some towels, quick.

678
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,790
Tie him up and gag him
and we'll put him in the closet.

679
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,440
Come on, let's find your car.

680
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,890
Hey.

681
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,270
Look out!

682
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,190
It's quicksand. Pull, honey, pull hard.

683
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,440
Come on, honey, pull, please.

684
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,820
Hurry up, honey. Let's go, come on.

685
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,710
What the...

686
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,090
No, no... Help!

687
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,970
Help!

688
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,920
Yeehaw!

689
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,840
What's that?

690
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,390
Can't you see?

691
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,850
That's old teeterin' rock.

692
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,600
I sure wouldn't want that to fall on me.

693
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,900
Oh, I sure wouldn't.

694
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,480
I don't like this.

695
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,030
Get that folks.

696
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,400
She's the guest of honor
and she don't like it.

697
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,240
Yes, ma'am, you're the guest of honor.

698
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:28,670
And, uh, we gonna ask you
do a little judging for us.

699
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,710
Judge... What am I supposed to judge?

700
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,960
You're gonna judge just when
old teeterin' rock's gonna fall.

701
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

702
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,890
You can't judge too good from right here.

703
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,600
So, we kind of got you a
better point of view.

704
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,180
- Right here.
- No.

705
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,580
Hey, how'd the barrel roll go?

706
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,700
Oh, the barrel roll was great.

707
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,870
Just great.

708
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,580
Come on, now.
Let's get along here with this event.

709
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,250
- Mr. Buckman.
- Hmm?

710
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:16,090
Please. I don't wanna get involved in this.

711
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,880
- I wanna leave.
- Leave?

712
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,220
Why, honey, you can't leave.

713
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,800
- You're the guest of honor.
- Yeah.

714
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,350
Didn't old Rufe here tell you
you had to judge something?

715
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,640
Oh, I sure did, Earl.

716
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,100
- Nah.
- I sure did.

717
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:31,270
Rufe, you scared the young lady.
Now that ain't right nice.

718
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,230
No. Just a gentle little joke.

719
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,420
- You're gonna have lots of fun.
- Hope you'll like the ceremony.

720
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,110
You're gotta lie right down here

721
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,110
and look up there and say,
"It ain't fallen yet."

722
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,650
Now, that's all.

723
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:46,200
Mr. Buckman, I said I didn't wanna do this.

724
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,540
If I'm supposed to be your guest

725
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,040
you shouldn't make me do
something I don't wanna do.

726
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,620
Now y'all look here.

727
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,960
This is our centennial,
you've got to abide by our rules.

728
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,840
Now be good here and lie down there
so we can get started.

729
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,090
Otherwise these good folks here
might not like it none.

730
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,470
Y'all wouldn't want 'em
to get nasty now, would you?

731
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,600
No.

732
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,390
That's your centennial.

733
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,310
I'm just not the right person for this.

734
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,640
Oh, you're the right person, all right.

735
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:13,810
Yeah.

736
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,320
Let's end this argument right here and now.

737
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,820
Yeah, you tell her, Mr. Buckman.

738
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,240
We don't need lot of playing.

739
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

740
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,610
You think this thing
here was easy to build?

741
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,740
Girl, you're gonna help us with the
centennial or we're gonna help you.

742
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,830
I ain't kidding you now.
It's a right important ceremony.

743
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,660
You're gonna help us one way or the other.

744
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,830
- Yeah.
- Kill her.

745
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,300
That's better. It's always
better to cooperate.

746
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,140
Mr. Buckman, I don't like this.

748
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,720
You want to know a little secret?

749
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,350
I know you don't.

750
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,390
- Now, lie down there.
- Yeah.

751
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,600
Come on, Mr. Buckman.

752
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
What are you doing this for?

753
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,690
I said I'd go through with it.

754
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,450
I know. It's just to be sure
you don't change your mind.

755
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,610
Yeah.

756
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,340
I get first throw, Earl.

757
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,550
I'm chairman.

758
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,010
Of course you do, Rufe.

759
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,430
But you can't stand this close.

760
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:26,900
It ain't even a sport if it's this close.

761
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,760
Now, stand back. Everybody stand back.

762
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,560
I just thought there was only
gonna be one throw.

763
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,810
It's a celebration.

764
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:39,110
Everybody's got to have
a chance now, don't they?

765
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,610
Come on now, everybody stand back.

766
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,820
All right.

767
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,570
What you gonna throw, Rufe?

768
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,410
I got one of those newfangled things.

769
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,240
A softball.

770
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,460
Looks like a little old rock.

771
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,380
All right, folks.

772
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,750
Let's not keep the little lady waiting.

773
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,770
He threw it.

774
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,770
Well, you got some lines to recite.

775
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,060
You got to say, "It ain't fallen yet."

776
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:24,480
It... It hasn't fallen yet.

777
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,950
Well, pardon my grammar.

778
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,780
All right. Who's next?

779
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,660
Hey, I want to throw it.

780
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,950
Oh...

781
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,050
All right, Miss, say your fancy line.

782
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,300
It... It hasn't...

783
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,840
Fallen yet.

784
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,720
Oh, Miss Beverly.

785
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,430
You haven't got the spirit of this at all.

786
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,180
Now you haven't got the right mood.

787
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,740
Now, don't look at me when you say that,

788
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,640
look up that old teeterin' rock.

789
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,980
It might help you say the line faster.

790
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:07,320
If somebody hits it, it'll fall.

791
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,320
- Oh.
- Oh, please.

792
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,910
No. Nobody round here
can hit the side of the barn.

793
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,990
Next!

794
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,660
Yeah, who's next?
Come on, let's see you...

795
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,830
All right.

796
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,170
Oh...

797
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,290
That's no good.

798
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,090
Wait a minute, folks.

799
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,630
We is embarrasin' our guests.

800
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,220
We ain't showing any marksmanship at all.

801
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,970
Yeah.

802
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:37,100
Come over here, Rufe, come over.

803
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:40,980
That last throw was just a warmup.

804
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,690
This one is gonna be for keeps.

805
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,070
Well, gal, I'm gonna give you a tip.

806
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,410
You judge this just right,

807
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,210
old teeterin' rock's gonna fall

808
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,130
in just 10 seconds.

809
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,840
No. No. No!

810
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,380
Please let me up.

811
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,590
Bet you I could pitch
in them major leagues.

812
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,530
We've got to find out
where they put your car.

813
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:12,360
I know.

814
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,780
Look, there's a little boy.

815
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,950
Uh, little boy, come
here, will you, please?

816
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,830
What y'all want, Yankees?

817
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:24,160
Look, what's your name?

818
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,330
- Billy.
- Well, Billy, uh,

819
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,630
- you like candy?
- Sure I do. Got any?

820
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:33,630
Why, yes, I got a whole big box
for you and the rest of the kids.

821
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,590
But, uh, I would like
to give it to you first

822
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:39,640
so you can take all you want before
the rest of the other kids get it.

823
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,180
Give me. They ain't getting' any.

824
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,890
Well, before we do that, uh,
we got to know where it is.

825
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,560
And it's in our car.

826
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,980
You know where our car is?

827
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,190
Sure do. Down at Lester's garage.

828
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,490
Fixing to taking it apart
after the centennial's over.

829
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,740
Well, I'll tell you what, Billy,

830
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,160
before they do that, we better
get the candy out of it, you see?

831
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,160
So, uh, why don't you take us there

832
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,290
and then you can have the candy and take...
You can take it all.

833
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,250
Well, uh...

834
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,630
Y'all to follow me, you hear?

835
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,870
I reckon the folks are havin'
a fine time on the boat trip.

836
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,040
Yeah.

837
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,700
You promised them a boat trip.

838
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:49,500
Now, they's gettin' one.

839
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,420
Let's see now. What's left?

840
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,590
We done save the best till the last.

841
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:58,220
That boy Tom's gonna judge
the ax-throwing contest.

842
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,720
I got a real sharp blade.

843
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,470
I'll get first throw?

844
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:05,390
Listen, I got as much to say
about that as you do.

845
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:07,730
- I get first throw.
- Now, wait a minute.

846
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:10,810
Now, wait a minute.
There's enough fun for everybody.

847
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,690
When the time comes, we'll toss a coin.

848
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:17,740
One of you can have first throw
at the ax-throwing contest

849
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,910
and the other can have first chance
when that little old Yankee gal

850
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,450
runs the gauntlet tonight.

851
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,910
- They got away.
- What?

852
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,870
They tied up Jimmy and they got away.

853
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,750
Let's find them. Let's find them.

854
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,800
I can't find the keys.

855
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,090
Hey, Billy, look,

856
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,890
the candy's in the trunk of the car.

857
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,180
Now, if you get me the keys,
I'll get it for you, OK?

858
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,770
I'd rather drive. Vroom!

859
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:51,850
Billy, you like to drive?

860
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,150
Well, my pa won't let me.

861
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:57,270
Look, because this is a, well,
you know, special holiday,

862
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,820
if you get the keys, I'll let you drive.

863
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:02,360
- Do you know where the keys are?
- Sure do.

864
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,990
Up in the front office.

865
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,280
I can drive this here new car?

866
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,250
Yes, we'll let you drive.
But find the keys.

867
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,580
If you wait too long
it'll be too late for you to drive it.

868
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,630
Well, OK.

869
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,920
I hope he finds those keys.

870
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,510
- But Tom, what if he doesn't?
- Well, if he doesn't...

871
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:26,010
Look, Terry, now look, if he doesn't,

872
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,140
I'll run out, try and draw their attention

873
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,180
and then you slip down to the highway
and try and get some help, OK?

874
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,560
But Tom, we should both try to escape.

875
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,400
We'd never make it, honey.

876
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,480
Look, don't worry, we're not cooked yet.

877
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,740
What's that?

878
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,350
Sounds like they're looking for us.

879
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,830
Look, honey, you better hide

880
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,000
and I'll go out
and give them a run for their money.

881
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,420
Tom, look.

882
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,260
What's that noise?

883
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,680
Oh, that's nothing, Billy,
it's just some people.

884
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,350
I want to see!

885
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,720
Billy?

886
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,850
Billy, if you don't come here right now,
you won't get the candy or the ride.

887
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,350
- But I want to see.
- Billy?

888
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,860
Right now, right now, or it'll be too late.

889
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,610
Nah.

890
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,870
Come on, get in, get in.

891
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,870
I want to drive.

892
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,540
Look, Billy, it's no fun driving here.

893
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,080
I'll let you drive 70 miles an hour
on the highway, OK?

894
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,960
- Seventy miles an hour?
- Yes.

895
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,090
Hot doggy!

896
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,600
- You get back here!
- Go get them.

897
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,350
If you don't catch them before
they reach the highway, we've lost them.

898
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:04,530
I didn't have a chance...

899
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:06,820
Oh, now, simmer down.

900
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,740
I said, simmer down, you guys.

901
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,780
Hey, what if they make
it to the state police?

902
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:12,870
What does it matter?

903
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,200
Centennial's just about over anyway.

904
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,670
Ain't nobody gonna be around here.

905
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,790
Them nice young people,
them lot will wind up in the loony bin.

906
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,210
Yeah. But what about Billy?

907
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,590
Well, I sort of wish they'd keep him.

908
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,430
But I got kind of a nasty
feeling he'll be back.

909
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,610
<i>? He put his banjo in my hand
and told me what to play</i>

910
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,450
<i>? And danced with my pretty little girl
until the break of day</i>

911
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,620
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
Goodbye, Betsy Brown</i>

912
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,790
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
I'm gonna leave this town</i>

913
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,720
<i>? I don't like that Old Joe Clark</i>

914
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,520
<i>? I'll tell you the reason why</i>

915
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,690
<i>? He's got two muskets in his hand
and madness in his eye</i>

916
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,270
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
Goodbye, Betsy Brown</i>

917
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,190
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
I'm gonna leave this town</i>

918
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:44,130
<i>? Old Joe Clark ran through my yard
He scared my little pups</i>

919
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:47,840
<i>? He ran my rooster out of the yard
and ate my corn bread up</i>

920
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,880
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
Goodbye, Betsy Brown</i>

921
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,490
Y'all are big liars.

922
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:14,780
Didn't even get my candy.

923
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:18,330
They never give me nothing,
the dirty Yankees.

924
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:21,210
<i>? Fair thee well, Old Joe Clark
I'm gonna leave this town</i>

925
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,260
<i>? Old Joe Clark is dead and gone
I hope he's doing well</i>

926
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:41,850
<i>? He tied me up with a ball and chain
and made my ankle swell</i>

927
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,060
<i>? Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
Goodbye, Betsy Brown</i>

928
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:57,320
Well, folks, just settle down
and take it easy for a minute.

929
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,830
Now let me understand all this
just once again.

930
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,580
This town, uh, Pleasant
Valley, is that right?

931
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,120
Pleasant Valley.

932
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,040
I'll never forget that name.

933
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,420
And just where is this town?

934
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,880
You say it's off Highway 202?

935
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,300
It's on a side road about
20 miles from here.

936
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,180
What's the matter,
don't you know the towns in this county?

937
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,260
Now, mister, let me tell you something.

938
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,900
You best just settle down for a minute.
That's what you got to do.

939
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,450
Tell you what, before we do anything else,

940
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,350
I am gonna give you folks
a breathalator test.

941
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,730
A breathalator test...

942
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,030
Officer, do we look drunk?

943
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,200
Uh, mister, I just ain't
about to argue with you at all.

944
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,360
Now, you go right over there
and get yourself a seat

945
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,740
and I'll get the equipment.

946
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,160
And if you ain't drunk

947
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,450
then you ain't got
a thing in the world to worry about.

948
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:46,120
Or maybe you're refusing to take the test?

949
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,580
Sir, we had...

950
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,820
Well, Rufe, you know, we didn't do so bad.

951
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,400
We got four out of six.

952
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,490
Yeah.

953
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:21,280
I sort of hated to lose that gal,

954
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:24,660
but I'd sure say this centennial
was a big success.

955
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,750
Danged old centennial didn't have no fun.

956
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,500
Didn't even get my candy.

957
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,050
You should've got your rear end
caned for what you did.

958
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,510
Now you beat it. Hear?

959
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,380
I'm gonna catch me a cat and have some fun.

960
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,280
I don't understand this.

961
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,530
Now, I know there was a road here.
I know it.

962
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,160
Tom, what's happened? Have we gone crazy?

963
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,870
Now, tell me, how could they
cover the whole road?

964
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,840
Well, mister, I don't rightly
understand it all either.

965
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,550
Now I reckon you know
why I had to give you that there test.

966
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,720
There ain't no Pleasant
Valley in this county

967
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,550
or in the whole darn
state as well as I know.

968
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,970
I told you we were there.

969
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,850
Mister, I have been around
these parts near about all my life.

970
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,090
Now, do you think for a minute

971
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:34,110
if there was a place called
Pleasant Valley around here

972
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,860
that I wouldn't know about it?

973
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,410
Sure is peculiar though.

974
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,330
Yes, siree, it's mighty peculiar.

975
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:48,450
Look, here's our tire tracks.

976
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,370
They come from over there.

977
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,250
By gum, they do now for a fact.

978
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,760
Suppose we just have a look in there.

979
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,970
How far is this town
supposed to be anyway?

980
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,600
It's about a quarter of a mile.

981
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,560
All right, let's go.

982
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:26,280
Oh.

983
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:28,580
Let's stop now.

984
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,750
I can't go any further.

985
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:36,130
Look, Officer, I don't know how
to convince you of this, but...

986
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,590
Well, we're not crazy.

987
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,590
Mister, I didn't say you was crazy.

988
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,710
Nothing like that.

989
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,630
It's just that I think
it's mighty peculiar.

990
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,640
Well, what's peculiar?

991
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,470
Well, to tell you the truth,

992
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,640
they do tell a story around here.

993
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,980
Reason I just didn't just send you
on your way in the first place.

994
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,980
Reason I come back here with you
is on account of that story.

995
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:59,730
What story?

996
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,110
Well, this town, um, Pleasant Valley,

997
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,360
there used to be
a town with that name, all right.

998
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,870
- Used to be?
- Yeah.

999
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:11,750
There used to be a town
by that name, all right.

1000
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:14,670
But back during the war between the states

1001
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:18,170
a bunch of Yankee soldiers came through

1002
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:21,800
and, well, as the story goes,
they wiped out the whole town.

1003
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:28,010
There ain't been a town by that name,

1004
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,850
I reckon, in 100 years.

1005
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,680
But it sure is peculiar.

1006
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,190
It's mighty peculiar.

1007
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:40,730
Can we... Can we get out of here?

1008
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,940
I don't like this place.

1009
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,820
Well, if you ask me,
I think what you folks better do

1010
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,870
is just get in your car
and drive on away from here, right now.

1011
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,080
I sure do.

1012
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,500
The most peculiar thing I ever heard of.

1013
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,270
I don't think I ever want to
drive down that highway again.

1014
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,280
Look, Terry,

1015
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,370
I know people won't believe us, but...

1016
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,740
And I don't even know
if there was a town there or not.

1017
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,450
But I do know one thing.

1018
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,670
It wasn't a dream.

1019
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,460
- Look at this.
- Where did that come from?

1020
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,670
Billy left it in the car.

1021
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:29,670
Souvenir.

1022
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:36,220
Look, Terry,

1023
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,560
try to forget about it, honey.

1024
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,350
Think, well, pretend it was a dream.

1025
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,070
But Tom, those poor people.

1026
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,650
I know they killed them.

1027
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:49,650
Terry, we don't even know
where they came from.

1028
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,490
If we read something in the papers

1029
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,160
about some missing persons
with those names,

1030
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,160
we'll write an anonymous letter.

1031
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,750
I know I'm gonna write a letter
to every authority in the state

1032
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,290
and maybe somebody will take notice of it.

1033
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:05,170
Tom, if it weren't for you,

1034
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:07,090
we'd probably be dead by now.

1035
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,800
Well, anyway, it's over.

1036
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,760
Where are you going?

1037
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,600
Oh, pick up the pieces.

1038
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,850
I still have to get to Atlanta, you know?

1039
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,520
Some of my luggage is in your trunk.

1040
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,730
- I'll make it.
- Get in.

1041
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:27,110
- What?
- I said get in.

1042
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,450
Now what?

1043
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:38,950
Now drive.

1044
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,410
- Where?
- To Atlanta.

1045
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,670
After all the trouble you've been in,

1046
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,670
I don't want you out of my sight.

1047
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:50,380
And after all the trouble I've been in,

1048
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,880
I'm afraid to let you out of my sight.

1049
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,260
If we get there early enough,

1050
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,760
maybe you can show me the town

1051
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:01,060
before the teachers' convention starts.

1052
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,890
You serious?

1053
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,390
Drive!

1054
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,520
Before I change my mind.

1055
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:13,990
But not back through that
state, if you please.

1056
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,890
I hope we have ourselves a centennial

1057
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:41,220
as good as this 100 years from now.

1058
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,430
I don't know if it'll be as good as this.

1059
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,980
But we is gonna have fun all right, Rufe.

1060
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,770
I wonder what the place is gonna look like.

1061
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:53,280
I sure like those automobiles.

1062
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,400
Oh, I wouldn't worry none about that.

1063
01:22:55,450 --> 01:23:00,080
Next time we are likely to have rocket
ships right in the center of Main Street.

1064
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,870
Rocket ships?

1065
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,210
Why, crikey, maybe we can
get one of those rocket ships

1066
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,170
and chase all those Yankees.

1067
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,500
Well, we better get to sleep
before the deadline

1068
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:15,220
or we ain't gonna be around here
100 years from now. Let's get.

1069
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,180
Come on out of there, Harper, you hear me?

1070
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,890
Sometimes I think old
Harper ain't that bright.

1071
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:26,060
No, he ain't like you and me.

1072
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,440
Come on Harper, it's time.

1073
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,810
It's time.

1074
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:52,960
Hey, wait for me!

1075
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,340
<i>? There's a story you should know
from 100 years ago</i>

1076
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:01,600
<i>? And 100 years
we've waited now to tell</i>

1077
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,020
<i>? Now the Yankees come along
and they'll listen to this song</i>

1078
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:10,850
<i>? And they'll quake in fear
to hear this rebel yell</i>

1079
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,860
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

1080
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:18,700
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

1081
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,410
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

1082
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,370
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

1083
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,430
<i>? Robert E. Lee broke
his musket on his knee</i>

1084
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:44,550
<i>? And 1,000 pieces
shattered on the ground</i>

1085
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,180
<i>? But he looked up then
and he gathered up his men</i>

1086
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,390
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

1087
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,730
<i>? And from his lips
there came an awful sound</i>

1088
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,610
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

1089
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,780
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

1090
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:04,280
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

1091
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:06,910
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

1092
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:24,680
<i>? Stonewall took a gun
and he made the Yankees run</i>

1093
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,680
<i>? But he took a fatal bullet in the chest</i>

1094
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:34,560
<i>? As he fell down dead old Stonewall said,
I'm a-givin' you a dying man's request</i>

1095
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,020
<i>? I'm a-givin' you a dying man's request</i>

1096
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,530
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>

1097
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,570
<i>? Oh, the South's gonna rise again</i>

1098
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,450
<i>? Yeehaw!</i>
