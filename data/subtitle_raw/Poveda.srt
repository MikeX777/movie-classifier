Based on a True Story

00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:20,041
"Justice, love and peace are the program"
Saint Pedro Poveda

3
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,641
Start of the Spanish Civil War
Madrid, July 27, 1936

4
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,481
Have you got a cigarette?

5
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,641
I've only one left.

6
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,081
How are you doing?

7
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,921
Not good.

8
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,401
This tastes bad

9
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,281
Ite, Missa est.
- Deo gratias.

10
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,521
I'll open the door, Father.

11
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,481
It's alright.
I'll go with these gentlemen.

12
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,041
Well I'm going with him...
- Whatever you like.

13
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,361
But it's mid-summer...
- It's so that he doesn't get cold

14
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,281
Cover your face with the scarf.

15
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,481
Come on, let's go.

16
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,681
Everyone in.
Come on, everyone in.

17
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,401
You, pay and then go.
- Come on, it's getting late.

18
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,841
At least let me
say goodbye.

19
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,161
Say goodbye?
Well say goodbye!

20
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,441
Hey, please...
Let him do it...

21
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,561
Leave him.

22
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,321
Come on.

23
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:10,721
Keep it.

24
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:12,961
Come on, let's go.

25
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,881
It seems the Lord
wants me to be a martyr.

26
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,561
Hurry up...

27
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,041
Don't worry.

28
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,601
Take care, Carlos.

29
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,921
We have the priest.

30
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,721
Name and surname?
- Pedro Poveda.

31
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,841
Ah! The... teachers.

32
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,161
Put him in the room
on the left.

33
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,721
He once told me:

34
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:11,961
"The truth is in what we do,
not only in words."

35
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,121
Hey!

36
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,201
You wouldn't slip me
the key to the backroom, would you?

37
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,761
The one on the left.

38
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,201
Where the priest is?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:55,521
What? Do you want to go to confession?

40
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,041
Yes, he can toss me a blessing.

41
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:03,681
Alright.

42
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,801
But don't rough him up too much,

43
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,161
the higher- ups
want him in one piece.

44
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:09,521
Don't worry.

45
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,841
I'll do just enough.

46
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,761
Relax, priest.

47
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,961
I'm not going to do
anything to you.

48
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,121
What's your name?
- Pedro.

49
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,921
Pedro...

50
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,601
Mine is Felipe, Pedro.
I'm sure you have more.

51
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,121
More what?

52
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,521
What do you think?
More names.

53
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,761
You little gentlemen are always
given lots of names.

54
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:59,201
You like having a lot of everything.
- I'm not from that kind of family.

55
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,841
But you're right,
I do have more names.

56
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,281
...Lest's see...

57
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,801
What?
- Spit it out!

58
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,681
Come on, tell me!

59
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,761
Pedro Jose' Luis Francisco Javier.

60
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:15,881
Didn't I tell you?
You've got every name going.

61
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,641
But what use are they?

62
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,921
Just for the sake of having them.

63
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,201
You're all just greedy.

64
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:32,401
We were poor, so I was
just called Felipe.

65
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,641
And if I wasn't careful
I'd get half a name.

66
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,601
Half for me
and the other half for my brother.

67
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,321
Here.

68
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,681
Do you want one?

69
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,481
They're Camel, what the rich smoke.
I'm sure you've smoked them.

70
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,121
No, thank you.

71
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,201
Thank you.

72
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:55,681
What's that?

73
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,481
This?
- Yeah.

74
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,481
A breviary.
- That's for priests.

75
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,241
Yes, prayers.
- Give it here.

76
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,321
Give it here!

77
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,161
Who's this?

78
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:26,481
A friend, a cave- dweller from Guadix.
A long time ago.

79
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,601
Guadix?

80
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,041
Yes... Guadix.

81
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:45,921
Hello!

82
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,041
That smells good!
What is it?

83
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,641
Leftovers from the lunch
you didn't come in for.

84
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:55,481
Where have you been all day?
We haven't seen you at all.

85
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,401
I lost track of time, mother,
you know, I was busy.

86
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:02,881
Busy. Well, stop being so busy
and come take a look at this, come here.

87
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,481
That's smells good!

88
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:09,481
Hey, hey...
We eat at the table.

89
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,961
We don't go pecking
about like sparrows.

90
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,761
Let's see...

91
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,961
The books aren't balancing.

92
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:22,081
Look here,
last week, five pesetas.

93
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,721
There were some boys
who had nothing to eat.

94
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,521
Right. And last Wednesday,
another two pesetas.

95
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,801
Señora Jacinta. Her husband
needed new trousers.

96
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,641
Trousers...
and boys.

97
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,881
Look, what I want to say is that
you've got to be a bit more

98
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,481
careful with money.

99
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,721
Don't worry, father.
God will provide.

100
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:50,201
Yes, I believe in divine
providence son, but...

101
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:54,401
Come on. Forget all that,
it's time for dinner.

102
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,681
Here.

103
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,961
Is this where you come
when you want to be alone?

104
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,041
Father Rafael,
I didn't hear you.

105
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,721
I've seen you here a few times
looking towards the caves,

106
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,641
from the chapel of
Our Lady of Grace,

107
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,361
I'm concerned about those people.

108
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,641
We don't even look at them...

109
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:34,681
Well... What can I tell you
that you don't already know?

110
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,521
Nobody goes there.

111
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,761
They go during elections and
fight over the votes of those cave-dwellers.

112
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,441
Apart from that,
they don't matter.

113
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:51,241
The rest of the time
it's diseases that fight over them.

114
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:55,601
Anyway, I...

115
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,601
there's not much I can do.

116
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:02,361
The bishop
wants me in the villages.

117
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,921
Where have you been?

118
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:38,041
I was thinking,
that what with these parish missions,

119
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,601
I could bring the faith
to the cave-dwellers.

120
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,481
The cave-dwellers?
- Shh!

121
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,081
Sorry.

122
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,481
Seminarians have already tried
going to the caves

123
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,241
And they got stones
thrown at them.

124
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,321
Then they came back saying
they were not

125
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,041
ready for martyrdom yet.

126
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:57,361
Father Vicente, I think
you are exaggerating.

127
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,481
Exaggerating, me?
- Shh!

128
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,481
Sorry.

129
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,441
Besides, you don't have
time for the cave district.

130
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:13,241
And his Lordship Bishop Maximiano?

131
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,801
Do you think he will want to
lose his favorite Father Poveda?

132
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,001
You're right,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

133
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,361
But, where are you going?
- Shh!

134
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:27,441
Will you just be quiet?
- Show some respect, please...

135
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,841
Run, Manolo!

136
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,401
Does it hurt?
Let me see.

137
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,081
Angustias, come here, hurry!

138
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,481
What's happened?
- He must have got up to mischief.

139
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,281
Oh, my Lord! How did this happen?
- It was nothing, really.

140
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:33,041
Him and some of his friends
came out to see me and he fell.

141
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:36,401
Oh yeah, I know how this fellow
and my brat of a son meet people.

142
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,281
Juanico, come here right now,
I can see you!

143
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,921
Come here! Come on, hurry!

144
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,801
Oh dear God!
We can't go on like this.

145
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,881
Relax, it's nothing.
- I'm worn out with these frights.

146
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,361
Come here!
What's happened?

147
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:59,881
The best thing is hot water and soap.
- Well, we don't have any of that.

148
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,681
What happened, Juanico?
It's the same thing every day.

149
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,201
Does it hurt much?

150
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,521
How did you fall?
You haven't told me your name.

151
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,401
Hm?
- Come on, tell him!

152
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,241
He's called Manolo,
and his friend is Juanico.

153
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,401
Oh Lord!
- What's happened?

154
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,441
Down there, there's been
a stabbing.

155
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,001
Someone's been killed.

156
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,241
Where are you going, Father?
You could get hurt.

157
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:29,081
Nobody insults me!
- I'll kill you, I swear!

158
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,441
Get out of here!

159
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:38,121
I can help if you...
- Get away! You're not welcome here!

160
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,001
For the love of God!
- God?

161
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,161
God left this
place a long time ago.

162
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,481
That man is going to bleed to death.
- Get out of here!

163
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:48,001
No, Manuel! Don't hurt him!
- Why not? Do you know him?

164
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:51,801
You spend a few minutes with him
and he's poisoned you already.

165
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,281
No!
- Go away!

166
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,521
Get out! And don't come back
or I'll break your face.

167
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,321
Come on, go home.

168
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,881
Monsignor Maximiano...
- Excuse me a moment

169
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:22,961
It is my dear Poveda.
What do you want, my son?

170
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,201
I wanted to ask permission
to take the Blessed Sacrament

171
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,961
to the shrine of
Our Lady of Grace.

172
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,441
To the caves?

173
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,241
Bishop, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

174
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,841
After all, those people
wouldn't appreciate it.

175
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,561
At the caves.
- There is so much to do...

176
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,121
Are you sure you want
to work there too?

177
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,641
Yes, Bishop. There is too much poverty
in those districts.

178
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:49,161
And we, the Church,
have the duty to help.

179
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,041
I know, my son,
our place is also there.

180
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:59,601
I will allow it provided you
fulfill your other obligations.

181
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,641
Thank you very much, Bishop.

182
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,361
Who lives here?
- Uncle Julia'n

183
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,761
He is very old,
he hardly ever goes out.

184
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,761
Wait for me here.

185
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,401
Uncle Julian,
can I come in?

186
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,641
And who are you?
- I'm a new priest.

187
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,761
The caves don't have a priest.

188
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:28,201
I just wanted to say hello.

189
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,641
My name is Pedro.

190
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,121
Come on, to the next cave.

191
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,721
Do you want to see them all?
- Yes, all of them.

192
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,161
Who lives here?

193
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,561
Señora Bernarda.
She has a big family

194
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,241
and her husband
died last year.

195
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:59,961
Fix up a cave?
I know it's not expensive.

196
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,121
But what for?
It's only half an hour from home.

197
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:07,121
I know, father, but I feel that God
is asking me to help those people

198
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,641
and I'm often there until very late.

199
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,961
My son, the cave-dwelling priest...
- Carlos and Vicente will help me.

200
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,641
What do I have to help with?

201
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,721
Manolo! Come here
right now!

202
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,081
Manolo!
- Good afternoon!

203
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:43,081
This child and his father, between them
they'll kill me! I'm sick of it!

204
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,801
I have a feeling the father
is more difficult than the child.

205
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:47,921
What a pigheaded husband I have.

206
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,681
If it weren't for the fact
that deep down he's a good man...

207
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:54,161
...as thick as a plank,
and as dense as a dark night,

208
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,961
But a good man.

209
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,921
If he hadn't been born here...

210
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,361
...who knows.

211
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:09,041
Before we begin, I'd like you
to listen to this young priest.

212
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,001
Many of you know him,
Father Pedro Poveda,

213
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:15,081
And he'd like to talk to you
about a highly important topic.

214
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,481
Father Pedro.

215
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,281
Good afternoon.

216
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:22,401
Thank you very much for allowing
me to speak to you here today.

217
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,441
As Father Manjo' n

218
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,961
Who founded the
Ave Maria schools, says:

219
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,441
"We do not have the right
to anything, except to ask.

220
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:34,601
And we only ask for
whatever you can spare."

221
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,081
It hardly matters to you,

222
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:43,921
but for the cave- dwellers,
it means so much.

223
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:46,561
Did he say the caves?
Oh dear God!

224
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,601
How can we separate our love of God

225
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,881
From how we must love others?

226
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:56,641
Our cave-dwelling brothers and sisters
have so little and it's high time

227
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,281
to pay attention to the destitute,

228
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:05,641
the hungry, the children
who have no school, no clothes.

229
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:27,361
For Señora Bernarda and her children,
ten cents for sandals.

230
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,681
No, seven, seven cents.

231
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,041
Seven? But isn't that
too much for sandals?

232
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,921
A child's pair of shoes costs nine.

233
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:41,121
You have to shop around more, Vicente.
- Son, he's right, it's not cheap,

234
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,641
Although, of course,
they are such a big family...

235
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,841
Seven pesetas, Vicente.

236
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,521
If we are bringing
them to God,

237
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,681
shouldn't we give them sandals
so that they can go near?

238
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,521
Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus

239
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,881
Who's that?
- One of the orphans.

240
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:08,521
Ite Missa est

241
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,281
Deo Gratias

242
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,761
Amen

243
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,361
Why are you crying?
- Because I'm hungry.

244
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,601
At last! We've been
waiting for you.

245
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,241
Who's this child?
- An orphan.

246
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,921
Come, sit down,
the soup is getting cold.

247
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,601
There it is.

248
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:47,761
That's it.

249
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,921
Angustias told me that
there are at least

250
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:56,201
seven other orphans in the area.

251
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:58,601
And who feeds these little angels?

252
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:01,161
Charity does, it's what
keeps everything going.

253
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,401
One, two, three... five.

254
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,801
And four?
- What?

255
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,001
Four comes after three,
not five.

256
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:13,321
Father, Manolo doesn't
know how to count.

257
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,401
What about you, Juanico?
How far can you count?

258
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,881
I know all the numbers
off by heart:

259
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:22,201
One, two, three, four, five,

260
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,841
seventeen, forty and twenty-three.

261
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,121
I see that you know them
very well.

262
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,961
Can you play this game?

263
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:34,961
You have to aim at this
square and then hop,

264
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:36,641
to pick up the stick.

265
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,721
I've been thinking about what you said
about opening a school

266
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:53,281
like Father Manjo' n's,
in Sacromonte.

267
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,081
You surprise me.

268
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:01,801
The Gospel must have education
alongside, to help them

269
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,201
get ahead.

270
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:07,161
That's fine, but where do you think
you'll get the money?

271
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,761
I'm going away
for a few days.

272
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,321
Where to?
- Madrid.

273
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,641
To raise funds for the caves.

274
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,641
My family knows Gonzalo,

275
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,201
the Marquess of Villamejor.

276
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,361
...Mejor...

277
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,881
What's that, Father?

278
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:37,641
Nothing, I'm going
to try our luck.

279
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:42,601
What a high flyer this priest has become!

280
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:48,401
How long did you spend
with the cave-dwellers?

281
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,041
Three years.

282
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,761
And you got tired,
of course.

283
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,481
I would never have got tired.

284
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,721
Everything went well at frst,

285
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:09,121
but sometimes things don't
turn out they way you'd like.

286
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,481
Father! Quick! A fight!
It's Manuel! Quick, we need you!

287
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,321
Get away! Get away from here!
Everybody out of here!

288
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,601
Everybody out!
- Stop, Manuel!

289
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:35,321
Stop, Manuel! For the love of God!
- You...what?

290
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,281
This is your fault! Everything was f Ne
until you arrived!

291
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,641
Manuel, calm down.

292
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,401
Nobody is going to build
anything here! This is all lies!

293
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,521
Think straight, Manuel!
You're drunk!

294
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,761
Come on, Manuel...
- Leave me alone!

295
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,041
No!

296
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:54,601
I'm not going to leave you.
- What a...

297
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,241
The savior of the caves.

298
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:02,361
Tell me, father,
how long will this go on for?

299
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:05,961
How long before
you leave us?

300
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:10,601
Do you think there's a future,
that my son will get places?

301
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:14,081
No. My child no.

302
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:19,561
My son will be a loser...
like his father.

303
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:31,761
There is still hope,
for you and your child.

304
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,041
Help me.

305
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,081
Help me.

306
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,081
Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

307
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,521
The classrooms, on each side of the chapel.

308
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:09,081
And the smaller children could go here.

309
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,401
Has the foreman arrived?

310
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:14,761
The load-bearing walls could go here.

311
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:19,401
Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Esperanza.

312
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,961
Is this where the schools will be?

313
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:23,361
Yes, look.

314
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,681
They will look like this, do you like it?
- Yes.

315
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,281
Aren't they beautiful?

316
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:34,281
Can I go too?
- No, Esperanza.

317
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,321
This is for boys.
Girls have to help at home.

318
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:41,641
No, it will be for girls too.
- Father, come on, it's getting late.

319
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,601
Poveda!

320
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:56,881
Poveda, Poveda...

321
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:59,481
Father Gerardo, it's very kind
of you to see me.

322
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,081
How could I not?

323
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:05,201
Being the bishop's secretary
means a lot of work and worries,

324
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,721
and there are plenty of those.

325
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:11,241
What can I do for you?

326
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,401
My dear friend...

327
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:17,121
They say here that you got
around a lot in Madrid,

328
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,481
seeing to your...
business.

329
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,721
The business of the caves,
Father Gerardo.

330
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,281
Of course.

331
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:27,561
So tell me, how did it go?
- I got some help.

332
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,841
You mean to say you don't
get enough support in Guadix?

333
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,681
I never meant that.

334
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:36,121
So, why go begging there?

335
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:38,921
As if we were a heartless lot here.

336
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,161
I don't think anyone in Madrid
thought that people here are heartless.

337
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,321
No one? For God's sake!

338
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:47,401
You even went to the Royal Family
to ask for money.

339
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:54,841
That pious Reverend Father Poveda
begging for help,

340
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:58,041
and making a fool
of the church in Guadix,

341
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,441
which can't face up to the needs
of their own poor.

342
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,921
How embarrassing! I wonder
what his Majesty thought?

343
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,641
I never thought that
the needs of the caves...

344
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:13,081
Think? You never think of anything
except your own affairs.

345
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:16,921
Your problem is that
you move too fast.

346
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:19,481
You're impulsive.

347
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,201
It's very hard and unpleasant to say this,

348
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:27,641
but I demand that you return
that money.

349
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,801
My dear Poveda!

350
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,321
Come here...

351
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,281
And let me congratulate you
on your hard work.

352
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:42,201
But let's go into my office;
tell me about it.

353
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:47,161
I'm eager to hear all
about your projects.

354
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:09,201
These are bad times for Spain.

355
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,481
And what's worse, I'm afraid
there are big changes to come.

356
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,321
You're exaggerating.
There have always been bad times.

357
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:19,361
In the end, what matters
is how you cope with them.

358
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,641
What do you think,
Father Gerardo?

359
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:25,401
Because we have already seen changes,
even in Holy Mother Church.

360
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,281
Here, without going any further,

361
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:30,601
the seminary students are unsettled,
with their parish missions.

362
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:33,361
You know, our bishop has his fads

363
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:36,241
And what about that little priest?
What was his name?

364
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:40,161
Him?... Poveda, he stirs things
up wherever he goes.

365
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:44,361
What do you think about him
being involved with the caves?

366
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,201
It's embarrassing,
mixing with the rabble.

367
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:51,401
Shouldn't priests be concerned
with their Mass and theology,

368
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:53,921
instead of getting involved in that?

369
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,481
Well, I think it is admirable
that he helps others.

370
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,841
Do you remember what we practiced?
- Yes!

371
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:08,721
Alright then. One, two,
one, two, three.

372
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:14,441
Glory, glory...
- No, no! Stop, stop!

373
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:18,081
...Come on...
We're not herding goats!

374
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:23,481
Juanico, try a bit harder.
- I am trying, Father Vicente.

375
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,161
My father told me
my voice is breaking.

376
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,921
But how can your voice
break at your age?

377
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,841
Manolo, I saw you.
Go back to your place.

378
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,121
I don't like that place.

379
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,801
Yes, yes... but your place is
there because of your voice.

380
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,641
Let's see... alright.

381
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,241
Father Vicente, I think that my place,
because of the voice thing,

382
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,841
must be there at the back.

383
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,641
No, you stay there.
Your voice is fine.

384
00:29:54,521 --> 00:30:00,001
Let's go again. Come on.
One, two, one, two, three.

385
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,721
Gloria, Gloria

386
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,201
Gloria, Gloria

387
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:10,401
In excel sis Deo...

388
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:16,841
Alright... alright...
it'll do, it'll have to do.

389
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:19,921
But I hope the bishop
brings a good umbrella,

390
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,921
because we're going
have a deluge here!

391
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:32,681
Opening of the Sacred Heart Schools, 1902

392
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:38,441
Careful, careful. Slowly...
Be careful, please.

393
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:43,121
Don't push. Slowly.

394
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:44,841
Don't push

395
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,721
Orate, fratres

396
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:05,321
Ut meum ac vestrum sacrifcium
acceptabile fat apud Deum,

397
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,561
patrem omnipotentem.

398
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:15,481
Gloria, Gloria

399
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:19,081
Gloria, Gloria

400
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:22,641
In excel sis Deo

401
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,121
This man is revolutionizing the place.

402
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:36,201
Everyone loves him in Guadix.
Look, he has built a school here.

403
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,161
Even the Mayor's daughter.

404
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:45,601
Honestly, I didn't think he would
get all this done so quickly.

405
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,521
It's so soft.
Can I try it on?

406
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:52,241
I'll let you have my slingshot all day.

407
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:54,881
No, for longer.
Today and tomorrow.

408
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,241
Please, Bishop,
just a moment.

409
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:04,001
No, no. Wait, Poveda.
With everyone.

410
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:06,921
You made this happen.

411
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:11,561
Come, Gerardo. And that
altar boy, the one I didn't tip.

412
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:20,321
Come on, boy, we are waiting.
- But...

413
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,681
Let's see, that altar boy.

414
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:25,841
Come on.

415
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,201
Stand there.

416
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:30,561
That's it, with your hands together.
As if you were praying.

417
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,001
Ready?

418
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,241
Please don't move.

419
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,641
Ready!

420
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,401
Who ever thought
we'd see a school here?

421
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:51,761
Well, there it is.

422
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,801
You know? I might write something
about the caves and Poveda

423
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,641
in my column in El Accitano.

424
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,401
You'll see.

425
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:01,961
What can you tell me
about Father Poveda?

426
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,281
That he is...

427
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,681
...a good man.

428
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:27,161
What do you think?
- They're lovely, Father.

429
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,081
They are for you,

430
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,481
so that you can make
clothes for your children

431
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,721
and for anyone else
who needs them.

432
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,561
Father, this is too much.
- Well, that's not all.

433
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:41,041
I've bought some sewing machines.
I want you to use them.

434
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,481
Since many of you
have no work,

435
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:46,241
I thought we could set up
a workshop here.

436
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,361
We do not deserve all this.

437
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,001
Why not?
That and much more.

438
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,481
Father, here we are.

439
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,961
This would be perfect for trousers.
- This for a skirt.

440
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,201
Like this.

441
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,081
See?

442
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,121
Look here.

443
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:12,401
We are here, in Guadix,
province of Granada.

444
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,841
So far down?
The land is almost running out.

445
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,401
And who lives here?

446
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,001
This city here in the middle
is called Madrid,

447
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,561
it's the capital of Spain.

448
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,361
Father! Father Poveda!
Read this!

449
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:26,441
What is it,
Father Vicente?

450
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:30,241
The Guadix City Council has named
you its favorite citizen.

451
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,841
Oh no!

452
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,161
They say they are going
to name a street after you.

453
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,401
What is it, Father?

454
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,721
Nothing, I'm fine.

455
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,161
I'm not very fond of
these things, that's all.

456
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:48,841
I wish they would ignore me,
both my good and bad points.

457
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,801
Let's focus, we have
to get on with class.

458
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:53,241
And who lives here?

459
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:58,321
Believe me, this is
nonsense, it's absurd.

460
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,761
Putting Poveda in the limelight.

461
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,641
And it's not the frst time.

462
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,441
Something was published
about him a few days ago.

463
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:15,241
And what's this about naming
a street after him?

464
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:20,081
Please, even you
don't have a street.

465
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:26,521
This will encourage him to feel
more powerful to do as he pleases

466
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,161
in the caves.

467
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:41,481
Manolo, shouldn't you be at home
doing your homework?

468
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,281
Yes, but I have been punished,
and it wasn't me who did it.

469
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:48,561
And did you explain that to Father Vicente?
- Yes, but he didn't believe me.

470
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:54,721
I don't want to go to school any more.
- No, don't say that.

471
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:57,841
Going to school and learning
are very important.

472
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:03,201
Knowing and understanding the world
is like having a candle lighting

473
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,921
in the middle of the night.

474
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:08,161
Without light in the middle
of the darkness, you can't see.

475
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:13,281
Right?
- Yes. I'm scared of the dark.

476
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:16,001
But the sun always comes out in the end.

477
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:18,081
Isn't that so?
- Yes.

478
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:24,321
I assure you, Manolo,
light always prevails over the darkness

479
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,441
Come in,
have a seat.

480
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:45,841
What can I do for you?

481
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:53,721
I have seen that some subscribers
of the Catholic Circle are

482
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:55,881
canceling their aid to the caves.

483
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,321
Is that right?

484
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:02,521
Yes, and I'm very disconcerted
about what's going on.

485
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:09,441
On one hand, they give me honors
I don't deserve, and on the other,

486
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:12,001
what little help that's coming
in is decreasing.

487
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:19,121
I'm concerned that without intending to,
you're setting a bad example,

488
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:22,121
It could look as if you
are seeking the limelight.

489
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,281
The limelight?
- Yes, perhaps unintentionally.

490
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:31,081
But with your attitude and
your public profile,

491
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:35,881
you are causing problems among
the clergy of this diocese.

492
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:38,241
Some have suggested a change.

493
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:45,681
I'm at your disposal.
You are my bishop.

494
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:50,881
I think it's best that
you leave the caves.

495
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:54,561
Leave the caves...

496
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:59,761
No, please...

497
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:03,881
Take your time to
reflect and pray.

498
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:08,761
We must understand what God
asks of us at any time.

499
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,401
After all, the schools can
continue without you.

500
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,681
Father Vicente, where is
Father Poveda going?

501
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:33,321
He is leaving.

502
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,801
For Madrid?
- No...

503
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,761
He is going forever.

504
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:00,481
Father!

505
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:04,841
Father, come back!
Stay!

506
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,961
They say it was
the bishop.

507
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:24,721
It says here that my son has left
and they hold the diocese responsible.

508
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:30,281
You'd better correct that note.
It's all lies.

509
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,721
Then let's look for him.
Bring Father Poveda back!

510
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,601
Bring Father Poveda back!

511
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:40,921
Father Pedro had to leave.

512
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:42,881
Down with the bishop!

513
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,161
Down with the bishop!
- Bring back Father Poveda!

514
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,081
You see, Bishop?
Do you believe me now?

515
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:53,361
That Poveda has no excuse!
Look what he's done!

516
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:57,401
And what happened?
What did they say to him?

517
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:00,761
And the poor cave-dwellers,
what happened to them?

518
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:03,441
See?

519
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:06,401
Now do you see why the poor
need to take up arms?

520
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:07,801
But it's not the way, Felipe.

521
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,001
Oh, it isn't? So what
is the way?Tell me.

522
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,961
Put up with lies?
With theft and abuse?

523
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:17,321
Allow those"gentlemen"
to take what little we have?

524
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:21,121
Put up with them killing us?
Is that the way?

525
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,281
Why are you here, Felipe?
- I ask the questions here!

526
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:41,401
Who was the man you said
goodbye to this morning?

527
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:45,761
Carlos... I think his name was Carlos.

528
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,601
He's my brother.

529
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:55,521
Well, you know something?
I had a brother too.

530
00:41:57,001 --> 00:42:00,361
But the rebels killed
him last week.

531
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:04,681
And I said to myself,
why don't I kill some rebel's brother,

532
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,961
so that they can feel
the same as me?

533
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,961
We are not rebels.

534
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,361
You're a priest, which in this case
is the same thing.

535
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:14,441
I am a priest of Christ,

536
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:21,961
and I can assure you that his Gospel
has nothing to do with this madness.

537
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:23,641
That's what you say.

538
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:37,921
And what happened after
they kicked you out of the caves?

539
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:43,201
I tried to establish a home
for street urchins...

540
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,801
in Madrid,
but it didn't work out.

541
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:50,921
After that...

542
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:53,881
I was sent to the North,
to Asturias.

543
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:15,561
Here you have Our Lady of Covadonga,

544
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:17,721
who, as legend has it, helped...

545
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:20,601
So this is the Santina?
- That's right.

546
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,201
Isn't she beautiful!

547
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:48,241
I still don't know how you haven't melted,
wearing so many layers.

548
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:52,361
What keeps you locked up here?
- what you see, reading.

549
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:56,641
I'm thinking about the problem
of education in Spain.

550
00:43:56,921 --> 00:44:00,681
I have read works by a number of teachers
from the Institucio' n Libre de Enseñanza,

551
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,161
who have had the courage
to open Pandora's box.

552
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,481
It's too bad they
aren't Catholic.

553
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:10,121
There's something hatching
in that head of yours...?

554
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:15,401
We need to modernize the entire
education system and its methodology.

555
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:20,361
But you have to start by
training Christian teachers.

556
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:26,281
Well, may God help you, my son.
May God help you.

557
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:29,241
We must have trust,
Father Comas.

558
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,161
We must have trust.
- Yes, yes.

559
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:36,281
Father Comas, wait!

560
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:42,241
Good morning, Father Pedrin!
You're up early today.

561
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:43,761
What have you got for me?

562
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,961
Letters, can you send them off
with the others at the post office?

563
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,041
Young man, haven't
you slept at all?

564
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,401
Not much...

565
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,721
This is a lot of letters.

566
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,921
They are for bishops
and other dignitaries.

567
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:00,721
We must involve them all
in the issue of education.

568
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,761
Fine, alright,
I'll post them.

569
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:05,481
By the way, what time
is the train to Oviedo?

570
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:09,561
In about half an hour.

571
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,521
But you'll have
to run to catch it.

572
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,241
Run, Father Pedrin! Run!

573
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:20,161
Oh, what a fellow!

574
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:24,441
Education is one of the
pillars of democracy,

575
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,641
as Professor Giner has said.

576
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:31,521
We want to train men who are
able to make decisions, free citizens.

577
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:36,241
Students and teachers,
sitting around this table, all equal,

578
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:42,361
talking and debating
as good comrades.

579
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:51,241
It's important that we join forces,
that we link up.

580
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:57,201
So, you agree with the
Law of Associations

581
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,161
that has been presented
in parliament?

582
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:00,481
Indeed I do

583
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:05,201
It's essential to exercise control
over the religious congregations.

584
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:08,961
We must move towards
neutrality in education.

585
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:11,561
This is the last thing
I expected to hear today.

586
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,041
I think I've heard enough.

587
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,521
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it.

588
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:22,161
No, I just can't believe it.
- Who do they think they are?

589
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,001
Oops! Excuse me, father,
I didn't see you.

590
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,521
It's alright,
no damage done.

591
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:29,881
Well...

592
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:33,001
Are you teachers?
- Yes.

593
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:37,041
You may be able to help me.
I'm looking for this bookshop.

594
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,881
That's very close by.

595
00:46:40,161 --> 00:46:43,721
Look, if you follow that street,
you'll f Nd the bookshop at the corner.

596
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,921
Thank you very much.
- It was nothing, Father.

597
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:48,241
Have a good day.
- You too.

598
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:51,921
You were running like a madwoman, Amelia.
You never look where you're going.

599
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,201
Definitely, the key is education

600
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,801
The key to the renewal
of a country.

601
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:07,961
With education, we could avoid
repeating the conflicts of the past.

602
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,721
That's my proposal to them.

603
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,761
As I see it, we should
emphasize the base,

604
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,561
the foundations.

605
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,081
Not only focus on the training
of students, no,

606
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:24,641
but above all on the people who will train
these students in the future.

607
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:28,241
Look, Father, excuse me,
but we do not see eye to eye.

608
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:31,401
Neither the group nor we are
as sure as you are.

609
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:34,401
What's more, we already
belong to another union.

610
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:36,561
I am sorry.

611
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:42,481
These letters have
arrived for you.

612
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,241
They are replies to
the letters I sent.

613
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:57,201
Do not be nervous.

614
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,361
What is wrong?

615
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,761
Hardly anybody has
agreed to implement

616
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,441
The proposals I made.

617
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:13,721
Only a few.

618
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,081
Are you worried?

619
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:21,161
No, no thank you.

620
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:23,121
Thank you.

621
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:29,521
I'll be alright.

622
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,601
What's wrong with me, Mother?

623
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:39,921
These are setbacks.

624
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:46,161
What am I doing here?

625
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:54,521
Help me, I beg you, soon.

626
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,601
Oops!
- Excuse me, Miss.

627
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:13,961
It's nothing.
Don't worry.

628
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:16,921
Have we met?
- The teachers.

629
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:19,721
You're the priest
we met in Oviedo.

630
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:20,881
Yes.

631
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:23,001
It would be good
if we could meet in

632
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,961
a more formal way...

633
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,401
My name is Pedro Poveda.

634
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:30,681
I'm Amelia Del Pozo, I'm a teacher
at the Teachers' College in Oviedo.

635
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,601
And this is Marcelina
and Carmen

636
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:34,561
Teachers?
- Yes

637
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,841
Would you forgive me for a moment?
I'll just be a few seconds

638
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:45,401
Thank you, Mother

639
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:52,201
Things here are not so good, Father.
We are at the bottom of the heap in education.

640
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:54,881
We need to train
competent teachers.

641
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:58,321
That's what the Institucio' n Libre de Enseñanza
wanted to do 30 years ago.

642
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:00,081
Have you heard of it?
- Of course.

643
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,481
And what do you think?

644
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:06,201
I admire its reforming approach
and teaching methods, but...

645
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,801
You hardly agree with
an approach that's

646
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:11,481
marginalizing us Christians.

647
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:12,921
Of course not.

648
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,601
Are there such things as neutral hearts,
ideas or feelings?

649
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:17,201
Does neutral
teaching exist?

650
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:20,161
And they are aiming to take over
the State monopoly on education.

651
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:23,441
That way they'll be the ones who dictate
what children should or shouldn't know.

652
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:26,201
But what can we do if the
government is on their side?

653
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:30,041
Train Christian teachers,
with the best methods,

654
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,521
so that they can teach
in State schools.

655
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:38,161
Would you be willing to get
something going in Oviedo?

656
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:41,801
Imagine a center near the Teachers' College,
that students from the

657
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:43,601
city and towns can attend.

658
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,441
They could study, write,
give lectures, take excursions,

659
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:52,161
exchange views, something similar
to the academies in Athens.

660
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:54,761
Yes, but how could we do that?
How do you envisage it?

661
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,041
We will open academies.

662
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,201
And the students from the villages,
where would they live?

663
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,481
In residences

664
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:04,281
Don't you want to change things?
Put your ideals into practice.

665
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:51,721
Carlos...

666
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:55,041
But... but what are
you doing here?

667
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:56,521
Father sent me.

668
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:59,321
Come here...!

669
00:53:05,201 --> 00:53:07,841
How are you getting on with your studies?
- Alright

670
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:09,721
Alright?
- Little by little.

671
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,081
Little by little.

672
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,481
And what were you doing?

673
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:16,281
I was studying these books
for a project that I have.

674
00:53:45,801 --> 00:53:46,881
That's it!

675
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:51,681
What's that?
- La Santa has given me the inspiration.

676
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:56,641
The Santina?
- No, no... Saint Teresa.

677
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:58,841
Saint Teresa?
- Yes.

678
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:02,001
What are you talking about?
- And what's more, I'm going to publish it.

679
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:06,161
I'm going to publish these reflections;
they'll be very helpful for teachers.

680
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,841
Do you remember our cousin
Antonia, from Linares?

681
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,641
Yes. Will she publish it for you?
- No, no. I'll send it to her.

682
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:17,721
I want her to set up
another academy there.

683
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,601
And then maybe...

684
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,481
... we could have one in Jaen.

685
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,641
Linares, Jaen...
You should get some rest, Pedro.

686
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,201
You're all very welcome.

687
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:50,401
I'm asking for a new system.
A new methodology.

688
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:55,841
Procedures that are as new
as they are old, inspired by love.

689
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,521
Education makes for a
strong people and nation,

690
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:05,321
but lack of it can be
the ruin of a country.

691
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:08,281
Don't you miss home?

692
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:11,641
You've been here
nearly seven years,

693
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,641
father and mother
miss you a lot.

694
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:20,561
Yes... You're right...

695
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,281
They've offered me a place
as Canon in Jaen Cathedral.

696
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:35,481
You could be closer to them.

697
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,361
But it's not so simple.

698
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,001
Are you worried
about the girls?

699
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:53,321
Well, it's clear to me, Father Pedrin.
They are well able to look after themselves.

700
00:55:56,241 --> 00:55:58,121
Hi Gorgeous! Come with us,
why don't you?

701
00:55:58,401 --> 00:55:59,881
You'd learn more than
in that academy.

702
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,241
Cooking and ironing,
which is what you're good for.

703
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:05,441
Who do they think they are? Barbarians!
- Ignore them.

704
00:56:17,321 --> 00:56:21,001
According to the Greek philosopher,
happiness goes with moral goodness.

705
00:56:21,281 --> 00:56:24,361
For Plato, if we are attracted to goodness,
it is because it is good.

706
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:27,921
Not only ethically, but
because it makes us happy.

707
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:30,521
How many young people are enrolled
at the academy this semester?

708
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,321
Only a few so far.

709
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:36,481
Parents prefer domesticated daughters
to look after the home,

710
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,881
rather than focusing on
a professional career.

711
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:44,801
Father, is something wrong?

712
00:56:49,881 --> 00:56:51,401
I find it hard to tell you this.

713
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:57,921
I have decided
to move to Jaen.

714
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:02,601
My parents are
getting old and...

715
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:07,921
Well, we knew you
wouldn't last long here,

716
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:09,721
you feel the cold too much.

717
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:13,641
But don't think you can
get rid of me that easily.

718
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:17,441
We will establish another
academy in Jaen.

719
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:21,921
And there'll be more.

720
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,001
My brother Carlos...

721
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:02,281
has supported me
at my hardest times.

722
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:07,041
I feel sorry that I haven't shown
him how grateful I am.

723
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:15,721
I wasn't even able to say
goodbye to my brother.

724
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:20,201
The night before he left
we had an argument.

725
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:22,361
It was about nothing.

726
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,961
And I never
saw him again.

727
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,201
They say...

728
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:32,241
he was buried
in a field.

729
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:39,161
In a field.

730
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,281
I'm so sorry, Felipe.

731
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:58,001
I'm very sorry

732
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,681
It doesn't matter...

733
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:06,961
Things... happen in this situation...

734
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:10,001
That no one understands.

735
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,481
Go on...

736
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,441
So...

737
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,641
How many...?
How many academies did you set up?

738
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:30,321
Plenty, lots.

739
00:59:30,841 --> 00:59:33,561
And schools?
- Lots of schools too.

740
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,401
Did you teach reading?

741
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:39,561
How long did it take?

742
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:42,201
As long as they needed.

743
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:49,001
Life is strange, Father.

744
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,921
In other circum... cirscun...
- Circumstances

745
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:57,081
...circumstances I would have
asked you to teach me.

746
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:02,481
I know a bit about numbers and sums,
to keep track of things.

747
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:07,441
But I just don't get
letters, you know?

748
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:10,681
But thick-headed,
and stubborn.

749
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:13,561
Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

750
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:18,001
Well that's the
problem, Father.

751
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,321
It's getting late.

752
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,121
This might cheer you up.

753
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:32,281
You never know...
You might start liking them.

754
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:35,721
Here.
- There's no need, Felipe

755
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:38,401
And this too.
- Well, thank you very much.

756
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:43,441
You'll have to excuse me, but when I leave...
I'll have to lock the door.

757
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,801
Don't worry.

758
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:52,601
Felipe...

759
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:58,561
When you can, find someone
to teach you how to read.

760
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:04,761
I'll do that.
I will, Father.

761
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,161
Out! To make a statement!

762
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:59,521
Do you know why you're here?
Why you are under arrest?

763
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:03,041
I suppose it's for preaching
the Gospel and serving the Church.

764
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:07,521
And for hindering instructions from
the Ministry of Education,

765
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:11,161
by interfering in matters
of State education

766
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:15,601
and for stirring up teachers
throughout Spain.

767
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:17,001
How's that?

768
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,761
I'm not an enemy of
State education.

769
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:29,921
All I've done is to help train
Christian teachers.

770
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:34,561
Yes... and getting involved in politics and
in matters that don't concern you.

771
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:38,481
Now you'll tell me that you had
no problems in Jaen...

772
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:06,241
Good morning.
- Good morning

773
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:09,281
I am Pedro Poveda, the new
canon in the cathedral

774
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:12,441
Do I have the pleasure of speaking
with Mr Manuel Segovia?

775
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:16,401
You do. What do you want?
- I'd like to talk with your daughter Pepita.

776
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:21,801
Forgive me, Father,

777
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:25,481
And sorry to be so blunt,
but you are too insistent.

778
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:30,401
Josefa, you see, is still very young.
She's only twenty-two.

779
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:35,161
How could she run an academy?
I have no problem with her teaching.

780
01:03:35,441 --> 01:03:36,801
But managing?

781
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:43,241
If only... If she were at least...
- If only she were a man, right?

782
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,521
But why are you so
interested in my daughter?

783
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:50,561
Because she has the
best references.

784
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:56,201
My academies are for girls and I have already
established them in Oviedo and Linares.

785
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,121
They are being
managed perfectly.

786
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:03,161
What's more, Josefa is the only
woman in Jaen with a degree

787
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,481
from the GraduateTeachers'
College in Madrid.

788
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:11,441
You're asking me to accept
the unacceptable.

789
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:17,081
Father...

790
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:26,041
Look, Father Pedro, listen carefully
to what I'm going to say.

791
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,641
I will allow it,

792
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:34,161
And may God forgive me.

793
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:36,921
Do not worry, Mr. Segovia,
I will take care of that.

794
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:40,561
This is so innovative, Manolo.

795
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:43,641
This year, thanks to the academy,
a lot of girls will be able to study

796
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,401
at the Teachers' College.

797
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,441
The schools had better get ready for
so many teachers. How dangerous!

798
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:50,161
What a thing to say.. silly.

799
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:54,401
Father Pedro says it is the
right time for women

800
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:56,321
to claim their rightful
place in society.

801
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:59,721
You'll be the prettiest
director in all Jaen.

802
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:06,201
I don't care what you say, father!
I want to be a teacher!

803
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,681
If you set one foot outside this house,
don't you dare come back!

804
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:14,601
Never, you hear me!
Never!

805
01:05:23,481 --> 01:05:26,201
You are all very welcome.
Jaen is to be congratulated.

806
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:29,361
In this year 1913 this academy
is opened,

807
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:33,161
and extraordinary teachers
will come from this frst group.

808
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:35,761
So Jaen will have to
get used to it!

809
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:38,641
Marina, right?
- That's me.

810
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:41,601
In addition to studying,
each of you will have a job.

811
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:45,041
There will be someone in charge of the office,
the dining room, library

812
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,401
and the laboratory.

813
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:49,401
Wow! We have a laboratory?
That's great.

814
01:05:49,681 --> 01:05:52,161
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Father.

815
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:53,801
This is Father Pedro.

816
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:56,881
What a joy to see this gallery
of brilliant minds.

817
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,241
Welcome.

818
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:03,201
They say that a certain Pedro Poveda has already
established several academies,

819
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:04,801
with the latest one here,
in Jaen.

820
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:07,521
They have a perverse
dogmatic background.

821
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,721
I don't know if you know anything
about the matter, Mr Echevarria?

822
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,521
I've heard talk.

823
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:16,321
That priest wants to
infiltrator State education.

824
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:21,281
I know, a former student
of mine is involved in this.

825
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,521
We cannot allow them to
take over education

826
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:26,121
as the religious orders
have always done.

827
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:27,841
And that Poveda
gets around.

828
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,601
He teaches at both
Teachers' Colleges,

829
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:31,641
He's involved with
the Press Association,

830
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,521
he's on the Board for Prisoners,
and who knows what else.

831
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:36,321
It seems this Poveda
is winning support?

832
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:37,761
Yes from educated women.

833
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:41,001
We must admit that the idea
is new and interesting.

834
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:43,321
Something must be done.

835
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,001
What should we do, Alfonso?

836
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,641
Cultivate public opinion.

837
01:06:49,641 --> 01:06:52,081
We must discredit him
and stop all this madness.

838
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:56,281
It has taken us nearly 40 years
to get to this point.

839
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:59,561
We can't afford
to lose out now.

840
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:01,401
I agree.

841
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:14,161
What's so funny,
Adelina?

842
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:17,201
Sorry,
it's Miss Marina.

843
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:35,601
Can I help you?

844
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,441
I have never seen
him before.

845
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:51,641
He was tall, well-dressed...
and rude.

846
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:54,001
He didn't look familiar?
- No.

847
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:58,041
Marina, does Father Pedro
know about this?

848
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:04,921
They said something about it,
but I didn't pay much attention.

849
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:09,601
"Master Pedro's altarpiece".
How witty.

850
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:16,681
Master Pedro's main
value is the strings,

851
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:20,321
the subtle threads that he
manipulates to suit himself.

852
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,921
We're beginning to cause trouble, Father.
- No

853
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:28,321
It's not you who's troublesome...
They're after me

854
01:08:29,201 --> 01:08:34,201
No, Father. They're out for all of us.
What's more, this is signed by Alfonso Barea.

855
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:36,521
He was at College with me.

856
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:40,281
What's clear, Father, is that we don't
want to throw in the towel.

857
01:08:40,561 --> 01:08:42,281
For sure, Pepita?
- Absolutely.

858
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:44,241
We are on your side,
Father.

859
01:08:49,361 --> 01:08:52,401
The chicken! The chicken! The chicken
is running away! Catch it!

860
01:08:58,241 --> 01:09:00,721
Marina, the lunch is running away!
- What happened?

861
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:03,961
We thought it was dead but
it turns out that it's alive.

862
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:05,641
Come on, hurry up!

863
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,121
The chicken.

864
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:12,801
What's happening? What is this uproar?
- I'll take care of it.

865
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:21,761
Come here, you!

866
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:25,961
It'll have to be pardoned...
for being so brave, right?

867
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:29,481
Who could that be?

868
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:32,161
Well, get this cleaned up,
it's a mess.

869
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:34,121
I'll get the door
- Come on then.

870
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:42,321
Good afternoon, Pepita.

871
01:09:42,601 --> 01:09:45,521
My goodness, Mr Echevarria,
the last person I expected.

872
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:47,001
Please come in.

873
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:50,001
I'm passing through Jaen
for a few days and I said,

874
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:54,321
"I won't leave for Madrid without saying
hello to one of my brightest students."

875
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:57,481
And very young schools
inspector too.

876
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,841
Excuse me,
this is Marina.

877
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:02,841
A pleasure, forgive me
for not, but...

878
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:04,361
Don't worry.

879
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:08,081
Student teachers.
I see that I am among colleagues.

880
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,281
This is Luis Echevarria, from
the GraduateTeachers' College.

881
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:13,161
He was my Professor
in Madrid.

882
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:16,601
I was just telling Pepita that I admire the spirit
of young people like yourselves,

883
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,961
getting ready to take
a place in society.

884
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,881
Our place, Professor.

885
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:24,721
I'm glad to see you
looking so well.

886
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:29,561
Father! Father!

887
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:31,601
Would you excuse me?

888
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:38,401
Father, this is Professor
Luis Echevarria.

889
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:42,001
A pleasure. I've been wanting
to meet you personally.

890
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:43,161
Me too.

891
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:46,721
I've read some things in
the newspapers about you,

892
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,521
many of them, let's say,
are not very good.

893
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:55,041
Do you think that an attack on
your person is being orchestrated?

894
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:59,721
Let's not beat about the bush.

895
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:02,561
You know the answer to that
question as well as I do.

896
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:06,081
As you rightly said, you only
need to open a newspaper.

897
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:09,241
You must understand that
many people see your work as an intrusion

898
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:11,841
in the State Teacher
Training Colleges.

899
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:16,601
I can imagine that you, sir,
are against all kinds of dogmatism.

900
01:11:16,881 --> 01:11:18,761
That's right, let there be
no doubt about it.

901
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,801
So then you will agree that if we should
not be dogmatic about education,

902
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:23,841
neither should

903
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:27,041
the Institucio' n Libre
de Enseñanza.

904
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:30,681
Don't you think it's pure dogmatism
not to tolerate that Catholics

905
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:33,601
want to train teachers with
a Christian spirit?

906
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:37,881
The people who come to
our academies come freely.

907
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:43,201
It's been a pleasure talking
with such good company.

908
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:44,841
I must get back
to Madrid.

909
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:47,121
Do you like it?

910
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:51,201
It is made of an
exotic wood.

911
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:53,481
I would like to
give it to you.

912
01:11:58,841 --> 01:12:01,561
Have a good journey, Mr Echevarria.
- Good-bye

913
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:12,321
Pepita...

914
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:16,241
Oh, Manolo! I didn't expect to see you.
- If I don't come I'd never see you.

915
01:12:16,521 --> 01:12:19,361
Yes, well, it's just that working at
the academy is very engrossing.

916
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:21,281
I'll walk you home.

917
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:30,121
The hospital is the same as usual.
Several cases of typhoid.

918
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:33,681
And you, how are you?
- Very busy, really.

919
01:12:33,961 --> 01:12:36,841
We start teaching practice
next week.

920
01:12:37,121 --> 01:12:38,201
What's that?

921
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:40,761
Well, committee meetings with
teachers and students,

922
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,481
assemblies, conferences,
excursions...

923
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:47,361
When we're married, you won't
have to go on working.

924
01:12:47,641 --> 01:12:50,321
I have a good salary.
- You're not being serious...

925
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:53,921
Well, what I was saying is that you could live,
you know, better.

926
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:55,281
If you want to.

927
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:57,601
Live better?
How's that?

928
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:01,881
I don't know,
like a queen.

929
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:03,361
Like a queen...

930
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:05,561
Is that what you call
living like a queen?

931
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,961
A married woman
stuck at home.

932
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:10,441
Anyway, my work is as
important as yours.

933
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:13,361
I didn't mean it like that.
- Well, that's what you said.

934
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:14,761
I have to go.

935
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:16,561
Good-bye.

936
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,281
Marina!

937
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:42,161
I want my daughter back!
Marina!

938
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:44,841
Marina!

939
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,721
Good God!
It's my father.

940
01:13:48,681 --> 01:13:51,441
I want my daughter back!
Marina!

941
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:55,681
Is something wrong, Pepita?
- What's happening, Marina?

942
01:13:55,961 --> 01:13:58,241
My father is what's happening,
I don't know what he wants.

943
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:00,921
He seems very angry.
Could he be dangerous?

944
01:14:01,201 --> 01:14:02,361
It depends...

945
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,041
Don't worry,
I'm on the way.

946
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,481
Where is my daughter?

947
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:11,681
What's the matter, my dear fellow?
- My daughter, she's been kidnapped.

948
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,801
Well! Really?
How come?

949
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:16,561
A priest. I read it in
the newspapers.

950
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:20,281
He's called Pedro Poveda. They say awful
things about him and his academies.

951
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,121
You shouldn't believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

952
01:14:23,401 --> 01:14:25,761
I told her not to come.
That it's all a trick.

953
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,841
I assure you that your
daughter is fine.

954
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:31,081
Marina, come on, come and open
the door for your father.

955
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:32,561
Yes, Father Pedro.

956
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:37,681
Father Pedro?

957
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:42,441
Are you the priest in the newspapers?
- The very one.

958
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,201
Daughter!
- Can you see now that she is f Ne?

959
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:53,001
Really, you're too extreme, father.
How could they kidnap me?

960
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,321
The newspapers, people...
- That's all lies, father.

961
01:14:56,601 --> 01:14:59,921
Come in, have a hot chocolate and
let your daughter explain.

962
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:01,241
Come in.

963
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:15,481
You'll be fine, Marina.
Everything will be f Ne.

964
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,121
Of course it will.
Come on.

965
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:35,161
It seems that knowledge
is at rock bottom.

966
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,081
Today we are going to talk about
an extraordinary woman,

967
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:53,801
who was even more important,
in her time, than many men.

968
01:15:54,081 --> 01:15:57,681
And even though she did not focus
on education, she was a great teacher.

969
01:15:57,961 --> 01:15:59,521
Whoever reads Saint Teresa...

970
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:01,641
Do you know who
they are, Father?

971
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:06,401
No, but today they're going to learn
a lot about teaching.

972
01:16:06,681 --> 01:16:10,161
...as in her books and the humanist
principles they enshrine.

973
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:14,241
But we cannot be knowledgeable
if we haven't studied it enough.

974
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:18,321
Well, then... that's all.
Thank you very much.

975
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:20,321
That's my daughter!

976
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,281
This material is
very delicate.

977
01:16:32,561 --> 01:16:34,921
Please treat it with
the utmost care.

978
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,561
Please excuse me.

979
01:16:46,921 --> 01:16:50,081
I couldn't do anything.
He was determined to see you and...

980
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:57,801
Manolo, what do you want?
- To apologize, just that.

981
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:02,641
I've been... thoughtless...
and a dope.

982
01:17:04,081 --> 01:17:06,761
I can't imagine a single day
without you, Pepita.

983
01:17:07,281 --> 01:17:10,361
Without your eyes and your smile.
- Oh...

984
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:15,721
Ah, yes! I...
I'm leaving.

985
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:18,561
I'll leave you there... alone.

986
01:17:18,841 --> 01:17:21,201
I'm going to the library...

987
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:23,481
That way.

988
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:28,561
Manolo...

989
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:32,241
You are a wonderful man.

990
01:17:33,241 --> 01:17:34,361
Really.

991
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:39,601
But I don't know if
we can be together.

992
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:47,601
My work takes up my days
and what we are doing here,

993
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:51,121
in the academies, is...

994
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:55,561
...is what God is asking
me to do.

995
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:00,881
It is what God is asking you.

996
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:03,121
I'm sorry.

997
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,281
Manolo!

998
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:49,801
Pepita, if we don't invite you
to dinner, we never see you.

999
01:18:51,241 --> 01:18:53,481
We have so much work
at the academy, father.

1000
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:56,401
And the girls need us
to be with them.

1001
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:58,841
They sometimes have problems.
- Like a family.

1002
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:02,641
Speaking of family... When are you
and Manolo going to get married?

1003
01:19:02,921 --> 01:19:05,241
Well...
- Yes, I know.

1004
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:08,841
I know the country's future is uncertain,
but what does that matter?

1005
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:11,321
It's a good time for you both.

1006
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:16,001
He has a good career and,
well, I'd like to have

1007
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:19,321
a grandchild running around here,
around the living room.

1008
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:22,041
I broke up with
Manolo today.

1009
01:19:24,521 --> 01:19:25,481
What?

1010
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,321
The academies need
all my time, father.

1011
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:30,721
I can't walk away
from the girls.

1012
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:33,081
Father! Father!

1013
01:19:38,281 --> 01:19:40,961
This daughter will be
the death of me.

1014
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:45,161
I knew that being the
director wasn't a good idea.

1015
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:48,121
That Poveda is to blame.

1016
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:52,041
The newspapers say it loud and clear,
that man cannot be trusted.

1017
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,681
Father, I can't let you speak like
that about Father Pedro.

1018
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:56,801
The newspapers just print lies!

1019
01:19:57,081 --> 01:20:02,761
Oh, Pepita, whatever it is, please,
for my health, leave that academy.

1020
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:06,121
I'll be blunt.

1021
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,281
The news, from
Church circles,

1022
01:20:08,561 --> 01:20:10,281
is not easy to take in.

1023
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,681
And your work...

1024
01:20:12,401 --> 01:20:14,881
Many believe that a Christian
education would ft

1025
01:20:15,161 --> 01:20:17,681
better in the congregations.

1026
01:20:17,961 --> 01:20:19,841
But not in the hands
of a few lay women.

1027
01:20:20,121 --> 01:20:21,961
That is exactly their
contribution.

1028
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:24,441
When Christ said:
"Go and teach"

1029
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:27,761
he was not referring
only to clergy and religious.

1030
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:29,521
And I agree.

1031
01:20:29,801 --> 01:20:32,241
But misfortune never
comes alone,

1032
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:35,121
this small-minded press campaign
is hanging over us.

1033
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:38,281
Slanders against you and
your Teresians.

1034
01:20:39,921 --> 01:20:42,321
From this diocese I have
requested that those

1035
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,921
horrible slurs be withdrawn.

1036
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:53,241
Nonetheless, I suggest that you leave
the governance of the Association.

1037
01:20:54,441 --> 01:20:56,001
You should not worry.

1038
01:20:56,881 --> 01:20:59,921
I myself would ensure
it continues.

1039
01:21:00,881 --> 01:21:05,361
Let's see if, the dust will
settle with this solution.

1040
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:17,081
Father...

1041
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:27,281
I have to tell you that I am
leaving the academy.

1042
01:21:32,361 --> 01:21:36,961
The Teresian undertaking started without you,
and can continue without you.

1043
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:57,601
I'm sorry, Father.

1044
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,361
Don't worry.

1045
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:04,841
Anyone can
have a day.

1046
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,081
I'm not going to leave
the Association.

1047
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,641
I don't care what
people say about me.

1048
01:23:16,161 --> 01:23:19,641
This is a big decision...

1049
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:22,881
Have you thought
about it carefully?

1050
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:25,601
Yes, Father.

1051
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:31,081
I really appreciate
your bravery.

1052
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:36,881
We are breaking
new ground.

1053
01:23:40,801 --> 01:23:43,721
I can tell you something now that
I have been considering carefully.

1054
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:48,881
I would be better if the management
of all the residences,

1055
01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:52,601
academies and
centers,

1056
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:55,681
could be taken
on by you.

1057
01:23:57,001 --> 01:23:59,241
In your hands, Pepita.

1058
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:04,001
Because you represent and embody
the spirit of this enterprise.

1059
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:06,961
But what about you?

1060
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:10,321
I have just received an appointment
as royal chaplain.

1061
01:24:11,161 --> 01:24:12,481
I'm going to Madrid.

1062
01:24:15,481 --> 01:24:19,041
Well, there are well-trained
people here.

1063
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:25,281
What's more, I believe it would
be useful for the Association

1064
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,881
if I am in Madrid

1065
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:31,241
The times are changing.

1066
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:34,321
Your time.

1067
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:47,121
What does your Teresian Association
have to do with the insurgents?

1068
01:24:47,401 --> 01:24:48,361
Nothing.

1069
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:53,201
The Teresian Association has never
had a political position.

1070
01:24:53,481 --> 01:24:55,561
It doesn't know anything
about insurgencies.

1071
01:24:58,321 --> 01:25:02,241
If there's a problem,
take action against me alone.

1072
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:07,361
We already know all that story,
but today it's ending for you.

1073
01:25:08,001 --> 01:25:10,561
The order has come from very high up.
- It's time.

1074
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:13,041
I'll take him.

1075
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:21,561
Conchi, is this the priest?
- Yes.

1076
01:25:21,841 --> 01:25:23,601
You wait here,
I'll take him in a minute.

1077
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:34,721
What happened to all
those ladies in Jaen?

1078
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:37,761
Could they continue
helping the girls?

1079
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:42,881
Yes... And they still do.
They are extraordinary.

1080
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,281
What happened
after that?

1081
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:49,121
Then I moved...
I came to Madrid

1082
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:59,481
It seems clear that we have to win
the battle on the field of teaching

1083
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:02,481
and with a neglected group that
aren't appreciated: women.

1084
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:04,201
Neglected,
but not by everyone.

1085
01:26:04,481 --> 01:26:06,681
Of course, because that wolf
dressed in sheep's clothing

1086
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:08,481
is getting them
on his side.

1087
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:10,841
Yes, he has got
head of us.

1088
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:13,961
He started residences for female
university students

1089
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,121
before you did,
Mr Echevarria.

1090
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:20,001
And if we're not careful,
this man will fill Spain with

1091
01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:21,961
academies and
boarding schools.

1092
01:26:23,321 --> 01:26:25,681
You have to acknowledge
Poveda's daring.

1093
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:29,081
Being a priest he decides to let
the lay people take the limelight,

1094
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:31,681
something even his
own people frown on.

1095
01:26:31,961 --> 01:26:33,121
And what's more, women.

1096
01:26:33,401 --> 01:26:36,321
And add to that the success he has
with the university residence

1097
01:26:36,601 --> 01:26:37,921
he has established here,
in Madrid.

1098
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:40,641
You understand that we must
act immediately, my friend.

1099
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:41,921
I agree.

1100
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:45,521
We mustn't stop at controlling and
blocking religious congregations.

1101
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,441
We must block the way
for lay Catholics,

1102
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:50,521
whether they are men
or women.

1103
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:54,081
We therefore ask that
the confederations

1104
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,641
of Catholic students
be included.

1105
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:59,441
Are we not part of Spanish
university life?

1106
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:03,001
You are controlled by priests!
- You by secularist politicians!

1107
01:27:03,281 --> 01:27:04,881
They will lock you
into sacristies!

1108
01:27:05,161 --> 01:27:07,041
Teaching must be
neutral!

1109
01:27:08,281 --> 01:27:11,641
Enough! Stop it!
Violence is not the way.

1110
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:19,761
So you've had your frst
experience of confrontation...

1111
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:23,561
Yes... I had no idea
Madrid would be so... so...

1112
01:27:23,841 --> 01:27:24,921
So hostile.
- Yes

1113
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:26,841
Feelings are
running high.

1114
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:31,321
Ideas are radicalized and
then violence happens.

1115
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:36,161
Now tell me, how is
everything in Jaen?

1116
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:38,601
Everything is going well, Father,
there is a lot of work.

1117
01:27:38,881 --> 01:27:41,241
But, anyway, it's our students
that matter most.

1118
01:27:41,521 --> 01:27:44,201
By the way, Marina has already
begun her doctorate.

1119
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:46,801
Great! What does your
father think about that?

1120
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:50,161
Oh, my father is ecstatic.
His daughter, the doctor.

1121
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:53,441
I don't think he even knows what it is,
but he still supports me.

1122
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:57,001
There are beginning to be lots of
young qualified women teachers.

1123
01:27:57,281 --> 01:27:59,401
How about that?
- I think it's wonderful.

1124
01:27:59,681 --> 01:28:03,201
However, the gentleman who approves
the degrees, I don't know what he'll think.

1125
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:09,401
Adela, Adelaida, Agripina...

1126
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,121
Amparo, Ana Maria...

1127
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:18,041
Antonio! Look, a man.
- Yes, they are almost all from the academies.

1128
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,281
It's what I expected.

1129
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:23,201
I swore not to approve
any of theseTeresian degrees,

1130
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:25,001
that I'd cut off
my hand frst.

1131
01:28:29,441 --> 01:28:31,041
And if I ever did so...

1132
01:28:38,201 --> 01:28:40,961
What are you still
doing here, Jose'?

1133
01:28:42,561 --> 01:28:44,401
Shouldn't you have
left an hour ago?

1134
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:48,601
Yes, well... Father, I have
to finish this as soon as possible.

1135
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:53,281
It's just that my brother
was in a bad way

1136
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,601
He was ill for a while
and isn't working now.

1137
01:28:57,601 --> 01:28:59,041
A scatterbrain too

1138
01:28:59,321 --> 01:29:02,601
And I have to give him a hand
at home because his roof

1139
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:03,961
is falling to bits

1140
01:29:04,241 --> 01:29:05,801
And now with the rain...

1141
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:10,281
Why don't you tell your brother
to come and give us a hand?

1142
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:13,001
That way he can work a bit
more and you a bit less.

1143
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,041
Are you really going to give
us both work?

1144
01:29:15,321 --> 01:29:16,281
Of course.

1145
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:22,361
Thank you so much, Father.
Well I'm going right now then.

1146
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,121
The report...

1147
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:57,161
Is something wrong, Miss Marina?
- No...

1148
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:02,441
"Report"

1149
01:30:03,681 --> 01:30:07,081
The frst summary of the work done
by the Teresian Association

1150
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:08,681
in recent years.

1151
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:13,401
Has Father Poveda seen this yet?
- No. We're the frst to see it.

1152
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:17,921
He's coming to the residence this evening
and will go over it with Pepita.

1153
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:19,961
What's in it?

1154
01:30:21,321 --> 01:30:25,881
It is about the twelve academies,
the university residence,

1155
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:28,401
and the Catholic
Women's Institute.

1156
01:30:29,361 --> 01:30:33,641
Avila, Barcelona,
Burgos, Cordoba,

1157
01:30:33,921 --> 01:30:36,361
Jaen, Linares...

1158
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:45,761
Three hundred teachers,

1159
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,441
classes for working girls...

1160
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:52,961
Thirteen years of work,
struggle,

1161
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:56,601
of excitement
and hope.

1162
01:30:57,721 --> 01:30:59,241
Good times

1163
01:31:00,561 --> 01:31:02,281
And not so good times.

1164
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:08,921
All in all, memories that
deserve to be documented.

1165
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,281
Who could have
imagined it?

1166
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:16,361
And you,

1167
01:31:16,641 --> 01:31:20,001
how are you getting on in the
Catholic Education Congress?

1168
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:22,041
The girls are nervous.

1169
01:31:22,321 --> 01:31:24,761
Are you?
- Me too.

1170
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:28,441
I have to give a talk and there'll
be so many people there...

1171
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:30,121
Don't you worry.

1172
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:33,681
As Father Pedro says:
"Trust in God and doing good."

1173
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:34,921
That's it!

1174
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:37,601
The brother-in-law
of a friend of...

1175
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:40,641
No, not a friend, it was
the brother of a cousin...

1176
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:44,041
A relative, it was...
the brother

1177
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:48,681
Jose''s the carpenter...
his friend's brother.

1178
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:49,921
Yes

1179
01:31:50,201 --> 01:31:52,281
Well, he told me that you were
looking for someone

1180
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:53,761
to work in a sewing
workshop,

1181
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:57,041
and I am a widow with four children,
and my father...

1182
01:31:57,321 --> 01:31:58,601
That's right,
Elena, yes.

1183
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:02,361
I'm sure you'll do
very well at this work.

1184
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:04,281
For sure?
- Of course.

1185
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:07,201
Thank you so much, Father.
No, you don't need to thank me.

1186
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:08,561
Thank you.

1187
01:32:09,601 --> 01:32:11,001
Please.
- Thank you.

1188
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:18,281
Yes?
- You see, Father, my name is Javier.

1189
01:32:18,561 --> 01:32:21,201
Someone's brother-in-law's friend
told me about you.

1190
01:32:21,481 --> 01:32:24,281
Ah no, it was a student
at the college.

1191
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:26,681
Yes, and all these people
came with you?

1192
01:32:26,961 --> 01:32:28,761
No, I don't know them.

1193
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:30,361
Do you want something?

1194
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:33,001
Yes, I want to talk with
Father Poveda.

1195
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:35,801
And the others all want to talk
with Father Poveda too?

1196
01:32:36,081 --> 01:32:37,121
Yes, Father.

1197
01:32:38,001 --> 01:32:39,921
What did you say your name is?
- Javier.

1198
01:32:40,201 --> 01:32:42,841
I want to be an educator and
I want to ask your advice.

1199
01:32:43,761 --> 01:32:45,441
Come in and let's talk.

1200
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:48,001
Wait for me here...

1201
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:49,641
I'll be...

1202
01:32:50,721 --> 01:32:52,041
I won't be long.

1203
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:09,121
Have... Eat something hot for dinner.

1204
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:13,321
And don't worry about the rest,
everything will work out.

1205
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:15,161
Thanks, Father

1206
01:33:15,441 --> 01:33:18,521
If I were rich, I would
give to everyone.

1207
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:21,361
My dear Bernardo,
you don't have to be rich to give,

1208
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:22,761
It's enough to be good.

1209
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:24,961
I'm a bit worse at that.

1210
01:33:35,761 --> 01:33:38,721
Poveda...
- Don Juan, good to see you.

1211
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:41,601
I've been wanting for some
time to see you and talk.

1212
01:33:41,881 --> 01:33:43,921
Have you got a moment?
- Of course I have.

1213
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:47,761
I know that your work is going very well,
and the activities are multiplying...

1214
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:52,001
Residences, associations...
Where do you get the time?

1215
01:33:52,281 --> 01:33:54,401
Well, tell me.

1216
01:33:54,681 --> 01:33:57,681
How are things at the Teachers'
College in Madrid?

1217
01:33:57,961 --> 01:33:59,041
You see..

1218
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:06,161
I have to admit that this meeting
here is not exactly by chance.

1219
01:34:07,761 --> 01:34:12,041
Things are heating up and I...
I wanted to ask you

1220
01:34:12,321 --> 01:34:13,921
to be careful.

1221
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:17,121
Your activity is disturbing a lot of
people and your academies...

1222
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:18,961
Anyway...

1223
01:34:20,281 --> 01:34:22,961
The problem is that
the net is closing.

1224
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:26,921
I appreciate your advice very much,
but I don't think that...

1225
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:30,601
Father Pedro, I wish I did
not have to tell you this.

1226
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:35,241
Oh, and another
thing:

1227
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:38,521
you shouldn't wear
your cassock.

1228
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:43,641
How are things in Hornachuelos?
going well, very well.

1229
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:46,401
...the circular sent by
the Ministry?

1230
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,281
Yes, regarding child health?
We implemented it this year.

1231
01:35:02,681 --> 01:35:04,361
Good morning, Alfonso.
- Good morning.

1232
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:06,921
Has the assembly started already?
- Yes. Several hours ago.

1233
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:09,161
How many teachers have turned up?
- Too many.

1234
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:11,561
And of course, Everyone's
voting against.

1235
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:14,681
So we're not going to be able to change
the regulations or statutes.

1236
01:35:20,521 --> 01:35:22,601
We're losing control
of the situation.

1237
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:24,641
We're running out of options,
Don Rodolfo.

1238
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:26,721
Even though we discredit
the academies,

1239
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:28,361
the girls still attend.

1240
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:31,481
I don't understand why our
campaigns are not successful.

1241
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:35,161
They've already opened
residences in Chile,

1242
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:37,281
and even the Vatican
supports them.

1243
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,801
This is a serious problem.

1244
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:44,561
These teachers are already in
nearly half of the State posts.

1245
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:49,001
The serpent's head
must be cut off.

1246
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:04,281
Father, we haven't told you the news
about the Professors'meeting

1247
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:05,761
at the Teachers' College.

1248
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:08,881
They're withholding our degrees,
they say we're not qualified.

1249
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:12,481
Yes, yes. I read it this morning.

1250
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,361
Thank goodness, Carmen Cuesta
defended our centers.

1251
01:36:18,361 --> 01:36:21,881
Tonight I'll go to see
the boys at the Shelter.

1252
01:36:22,161 --> 01:36:24,801
What about dinner?
- I'll eat with them.

1253
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:28,161
See you later.

1254
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:34,641
This looks great.

1255
01:36:35,681 --> 01:36:38,601
Children... Quiet please.

1256
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,281
Are you hungry?

1257
01:36:43,961 --> 01:36:45,761
A little here...

1258
01:36:47,561 --> 01:36:49,681
and a little there.

1259
01:36:50,761 --> 01:36:52,121
Are you very hungry?

1260
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:54,521
Father, I'm sick
of soup...

1261
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:56,321
I thought you liked
it last time,

1262
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:58,601
so I asked the cook for
to make it for today,

1263
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,761
and for tomorrow
and the next day...

1264
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:02,681
No!

1265
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:15,081
Boys...

1266
01:37:24,121 --> 01:37:26,001
Aren't you going to
tell me off?

1267
01:37:27,161 --> 01:37:28,201
No.

1268
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:32,641
Sometimes it's enough
to just be here.

1269
01:37:33,401 --> 01:37:34,841
Alright then.

1270
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:52,001
Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Echevarria.

1271
01:37:52,281 --> 01:37:53,961
Have your gentlemen
all arrived?

1272
01:37:54,241 --> 01:37:57,681
Yes, they are gathered in the
Parliamentary Commission room.

1273
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:00,081
Between you and me,
what's the mood like?

1274
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:03,561
Heated. You know,
always the same subject.

1275
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:07,761
I insist, gentlemen,
we must move towards

1276
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:09,001
an absolutely secular state,

1277
01:38:09,281 --> 01:38:11,921
and block out all these
religious orders who have

1278
01:38:12,201 --> 01:38:14,521
control of Education:
Jesuits, Marianists, Teresians...

1279
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:18,161
It should be made clear that
the Teresian are lay women

1280
01:38:18,441 --> 01:38:19,441
and do not belong to
any congregation.

1281
01:38:19,721 --> 01:38:21,401
As has already been
said in this Parliament:

1282
01:38:21,681 --> 01:38:23,761
Spain is no longer Catholic.

1283
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:26,561
And long may that remain the case,
gentlemen. It is an issue

1284
01:38:26,841 --> 01:38:28,121
of public health.

1285
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:30,561
We must end...
- Gentlemen, gentlemen...

1286
01:38:30,841 --> 01:38:31,961
Gentlemen!

1287
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:36,081
If you gentlemen continue towards
radicalization and confrontation

1288
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:38,481
I cannot follow you

1289
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:41,441
I do not want my children to
live through a civil war.

1290
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:01,521
Our friend Julia deserves
special recognition.

1291
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:05,241
It is not at all usual
nowadays to meet

1292
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:07,201
a lady deputy mayor.

1293
01:39:07,481 --> 01:39:10,561
Well, Father, it's not such
a big thing. It's a one-horse town.

1294
01:39:10,841 --> 01:39:11,921
But of course it matters!

1295
01:39:12,201 --> 01:39:15,001
It is high time for women
to be involved in politics.

1296
01:39:15,281 --> 01:39:18,161
As father says, we are essential
for change to happen

1297
01:39:18,441 --> 01:39:20,001
Politics, talking...

1298
01:39:20,281 --> 01:39:22,961
Today things are going
very differently.

1299
01:39:24,601 --> 01:39:26,281
Oh my God!
Take cover!

1300
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:44,641
Fernando, help me!
What can we do for him?

1301
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,281
Nothing.
- Relax...

1302
01:39:49,481 --> 01:39:51,841
Relax, you're not alone.

1303
01:39:53,561 --> 01:39:55,161
Relax son...

1304
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:03,401
Ego Te absolvo, in nomin
Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti...

1305
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,401
Where will all
this take us?

1306
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:22,201
A few years ago, children
played with toy guns

1307
01:40:22,481 --> 01:40:23,721
and now they're playing
with real ones.

1308
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:25,161
To win, we must fight.

1309
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:27,721
I don't want to hear
of winners and losers.

1310
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,641
It's a time to be
very cautious.

1311
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:41,681
It's a time for mercy,

1312
01:40:42,961 --> 01:40:46,321
to be in peace
and give peace.

1313
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:52,841
Christ taught us to
love and forgive,

1314
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:57,721
never, ever, to hate.

1315
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:05,321
Last night they killed a lieutenant
in the Assault Guard.

1316
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,601
The situation is getting
very tense.

1317
01:41:08,601 --> 01:41:10,521
Good night.
- Good night, Father.

1318
01:41:12,001 --> 01:41:13,921
Come on, let's go...

1319
01:41:15,001 --> 01:41:16,521
Everyone to bed.

1320
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:22,441
Come on, into bed...

1321
01:41:23,761 --> 01:41:24,801
Come on.

1322
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:26,601
What's happening, Father?

1323
01:41:28,561 --> 01:41:30,201
Say your prayers and
go to sleep.

1324
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:33,281
Come on...

1325
01:41:33,561 --> 01:41:37,041
And don't worry about outside.
Nothing's going to happen to you here.

1326
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,681
Right, good night.

1327
01:41:44,121 --> 01:41:46,041
Father, be careful.

1328
01:42:19,841 --> 01:42:23,801
Father, you've got to get away,
it's not safe for you here.

1329
01:42:30,921 --> 01:42:34,241
Another criminal plot against
the Republic has been foiled.

1330
01:42:34,521 --> 01:42:39,201
A part of the Spanish army in
Morocco has taken arms,

1331
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:43,721
in a rebellion against the national government
and their own country.

1332
01:42:45,481 --> 01:42:50,521
Spanish peasants, come in by
the thousands, from towns and villages,

1333
01:42:50,801 --> 01:42:54,881
hamlets and farms, and move to the
city which is still held by

1334
01:42:55,161 --> 01:42:56,481
the insurgents.

1335
01:42:57,841 --> 01:43:02,561
We will apply the law with
unyielding formlessness.

1336
01:43:02,841 --> 01:43:05,241
Start preparing graves!

1337
01:43:05,521 --> 01:43:09,841
Any enemy that you find...
I authorize you to kill them like dogs.

1338
01:43:21,481 --> 01:43:23,001
Lord, you see me.

1339
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:25,641
I can't take any more.

1340
01:43:27,921 --> 01:43:30,481
For your sake I've kept
going to the end.

1341
01:43:33,321 --> 01:43:34,921
But in vain, it seems.

1342
01:43:39,241 --> 01:43:41,361
Is this the hour of darkness?

1343
01:43:45,241 --> 01:43:46,401
My God...

1344
01:43:50,881 --> 01:43:54,761
Give me strength to get
through this storm.

1345
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:00,601
I offer you my life.

1346
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,841
And if it is your will,

1347
01:44:08,841 --> 01:44:10,361
give me your grace...

1348
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:14,121
to...

1349
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:20,161
to stay with you,
even to Calvary.

1350
01:44:29,441 --> 01:44:30,521
Comrade...

1351
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:33,161
Comrade!

1352
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:36,721
Do you want a Camel?
- No need to ask!

1353
01:44:37,001 --> 01:44:39,881
I've just been given the packet.
- Well, I can see you like them.

1354
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,201
Ah, no, I'm just a softy.

1355
01:44:42,481 --> 01:44:45,361
I've given some to a prisoner.
From Andalusia, like you.

1356
01:44:45,641 --> 01:44:46,641
From where?

1357
01:44:46,921 --> 01:44:50,281
He'd been around, in Guadix,
and he was a teacher.

1358
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:52,761
A teacher?
- Yes.

1359
01:44:53,441 --> 01:44:54,521
What was his name?

1360
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:58,481
Let's see if I remember,
he had lots of names.

1361
01:45:00,281 --> 01:45:02,201
His surname was Poveda.

1362
01:45:03,721 --> 01:45:06,401
Pedro Poveda?
- Yes, him.

1363
01:45:07,001 --> 01:45:08,721
Where is he?
- At the end to the left.

1364
01:45:09,001 --> 01:45:11,001
But I think he's been taken
to make a statement.

1365
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:19,561
The priest?
- What's up with you, Manolo?

1366
01:45:19,841 --> 01:45:20,961
The priest?

1367
01:45:22,801 --> 01:45:24,081
Because it was
Poveda, right?

1368
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:27,041
Yes, Pedro Poveda.
Why do you want to know?

1369
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,561
Well, you could have told me.
Where is he?

1370
01:45:33,881 --> 01:45:36,161
They have taken him to the
committee in Piamonte Street,

1371
01:45:36,441 --> 01:45:38,161
they wanted to question
him there too.

1372
01:45:39,881 --> 01:45:41,161
Is there a car free?

1373
01:45:41,441 --> 01:45:43,121
The one that was is being used
to take him to Piamonte.

1374
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:44,521
Yes, I know.
Get them on the line.

1375
01:45:44,801 --> 01:45:47,321
And if Poveda is there, make sure
they hold him until I get there.

1376
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:52,001
Miss?

1377
01:45:52,281 --> 01:45:55,921
Maybe you'll get there sooner
if you walk quickly...

1378
01:45:58,321 --> 01:45:59,921
Manolo, good luck!

1379
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:01,321
Hello?

1380
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:08,241
What do you mean no-one knows?
He was brought there hours ago.

1381
01:46:11,161 --> 01:46:13,121
Alright. Thank you.

1382
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,681
I think we should go
and look for him.

1383
01:46:27,521 --> 01:46:31,561
He was registered here, but it seems he
left immediately for Narvaez Street.

1384
01:46:31,841 --> 01:46:33,361
It seems to have
been a mistake.

1385
01:46:33,641 --> 01:46:35,001
Those...

1386
01:46:41,841 --> 01:46:43,001
This way.

1387
01:46:47,361 --> 01:46:48,561
Go through, priest.

1388
01:46:51,561 --> 01:46:52,801
Now there are two of you.

1389
01:46:59,681 --> 01:47:03,761
Are you a priest?
- Yes, my name is Julio Bareia.

1390
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:07,961
And I am Pedro Poveda,
I'm also a priest.

1391
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:11,401
I would like to
have confession.

1392
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:16,321
But he had just arrived.
How can he be gone already?

1393
01:47:16,601 --> 01:47:19,041
Look, comrade, as soon as he came in,
another car arrived,

1394
01:47:19,321 --> 01:47:20,841
they asked for him
and took him away

1395
01:47:21,121 --> 01:47:23,001
So, just like that?
- Just like that.

1396
01:47:23,281 --> 01:47:24,681
There was a political officer.

1397
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:26,601
Right...

1398
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,841
Look, in my office,

1399
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:37,201
in the black book on the table,
you'll f Nd the telephone numbers.

1400
01:47:37,481 --> 01:47:40,321
If you want to call the committees
yourself, it'll be quicker.

1401
01:47:40,601 --> 01:47:41,841
That would be better.

1402
01:47:58,481 --> 01:48:00,441
Take me to the Eastern
Cemetery, quickly!

1403
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:02,161
But... - Move it!

1404
01:48:26,681 --> 01:48:29,081
It's urgent. Hurry up,
please, let's go.

1405
01:48:30,241 --> 01:48:31,561
It's that way.

1406
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:49,601
Yes?

1407
01:48:56,401 --> 01:48:57,481
How's that?

1408
01:50:02,441 --> 01:50:03,841
It can't be.

1409
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,321
Did you know this priest?

1410
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:48,121
Yes.

1411
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:52,001
He's the one who
made me a person.

1412
01:51:00,241 --> 01:51:05,121
I assure you, Manolo,
light always prevails over darkness.

1413
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:35,041
Pedro Poveda Castroverde died giving witness
to his faith on 28th July 1936 in Madrid

1414
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,721
at the beginning of the
Spanish Civil War.

1415
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:43,041
In 1974 he was awarded the title of
"Educator and Humanist"by UNESCO

1416
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:46,321
and was canonized by
Pope John Paul II in 2003.

1417
01:51:47,081 --> 01:51:50,401
Saint Pedro Poveda founded
the Teresian Association

1418
01:51:50,681 --> 01:51:55,201
in Covadonga (Asturias) in 191 1,
a broad educational, spiritual and lay movement.

1419
01:51:55,481 --> 01:51:58,201
The Teresian Association
is extended around the world

1420
01:51:58,481 --> 01:52:01,401
and it continues to promote
the presence of the people of faith

1421
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:05,001
in the public and private areas of social
and educational action.
