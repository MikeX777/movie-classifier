1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,137
(loud explosion)

2
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,215
(clock striking)

3
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:40,274
(smooth jazz music)

4
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,685
- Hey I come here
 to work every day

5
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,087
and I see these women
 getting ahead of me at work,

6
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,290
every day, I see
 them getting the jobs

7
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,659
that I should be
 getting, doing the things

8
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,427
that I should be doing.

9
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,863
I see them here at work
 trying to be just like men

10
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,267
you know and I don't know
 where they're coming from.

11
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,636
Now don't get me wrong I
 think a woman should work

12
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,373
just not making more
 money then the man,

13
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,940
'cause it causes friction.

14
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:13,033
- They can give the jobs to
 black women, white women,

15
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:18,239
the Chinese or a damn
 chimpanzee for that matter.

16
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,642
You see it's not gonna
affect me in the least.

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,648
I'm bringing home in the
neighborhood of $63,000 a year.

18
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,786
Drive this sweet little SX
 and in just a matter of days

19
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,523
I will have closed on this
 rather nice lakefront home.

20
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:40,261
So you see I truly do have
 the best of both worlds.

21
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,296
I mean I go out with
 the cream of the crop

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,335
in both black women
 and white women.

23
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,173
And when you stop to think
 about it, deep down inside,

24
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,245
every man wants to
 be just like me.

25
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:05,453
And could you blame
them, I didn't think so.

26
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,415
(water running)

27
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,861
- You know it aint affected
 none 'cause I aint got no job,

28
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,398
I really don't want my
 motherfucking job you know.

29
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,200
'Cause that work shit it fowl,

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,968
I mean everybody else
getting paid 'cept you,

31
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:58,205
event the government, and
 when you see Uncle Sammy

32
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,808
bust a sweat, you
 know what I'm saying.

33
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,311
I figure if I've gotta do
 something I drive a cab man

34
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,479
'cause drive motherfuckers
 around for money

35
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:09,583
is easy as shit, till
 I hit that old ladies.

36
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,920
I mean there's this old lady
out in the middle of the street

37
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,255
right and I figured
 she got Alzheimer's

38
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,358
so I'm a help her remember
 where the fuck she at.

39
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,228
Say old bitch get you arse
 out the street, right.

40
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,964
She didn't move so I sped up
on her just a little bit right.

41
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:29,002
Tag her arse, cost my
 license but I had a laugh,

42
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,272
straight up.

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,383
- See I knew it was coming
 12 years before it did

44
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,118
so I've prepared myself,
 so I opened up a business

45
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,820
right here in the neighborhood.

46
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,023
That way they can't
 systematically oppress me.

47
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,527
My only problem is finding a
sister involved in the movement

48
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,963
the black women of today
are involved in them

49
00:04:55,996 --> 00:05:00,334
bourgeoisie European values,
 fake hair, fake eyes,

50
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:03,671
fake nails, but talking
 about they want a real man.

51
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,006
But when they see
 that they're not white

52
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,542
and never will be
 they'll be back.

53
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,681
In the meantime I'm gonna
 drop these newsletters off

54
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,983
in their mailboxes
 till they wake up.

55
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,095

* And everything will

79
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,145
(smooth music)

80
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:05,993
- Hey how you doing?

81
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,194
- All right.

82
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,328
- So what's up?

83
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,030
- Working my
 fingers to the bone,

84
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,765
all these nappy head
 assistants coming in here

85
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,468
talking about make me look
 fine, give me the latest

86
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,169
I wanna tell them there
aint nothing I can do

87
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,906
with them naps, especially
 the ones with the kitchens.

88
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,274
But I tell them sit on down
 peer, I'll take care of you.

89
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,543
- Now see I'm gonna do
 what you say about my hair

90
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,477
when I'm not here.

91
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,278
- Nothing, you're beautiful,

92
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,014
I love working on your hair.

93
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:27,848
- Yeah I bet.

94
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,716
- How's work?

95
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:34,221
- Well, I'm up for
 that promotion,

96
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,659
and if I get it I'll
be making so much money

97
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,595
I might even have to pay
 you when I'm supposed too.

98
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,432
- Hmm, well you deserve
 it, how's what's his name?

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,068
- Now you know his
name, Thomas, he's fine.

100
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,837
- Are things improving?

101
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,672
- We're trying, I'm trying.

102
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,540
- I don't know what's
 wrong with you,

103
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,041
you know what you need?

104
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,544
- I don't even know why I
 said anything, don't start.

105
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,045
- No I'm serious, you
 know what you need,

106
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,547
you need a man with
 some cash flow,

107
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,448
not somebody sitting around
 waiting to win the Lotto.

108
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,183
- What did I tell you before,

109
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,252
it has nothing to do with money.

110
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,520
If I just thought
 that he was trying.

111
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,422
- Well I'd like to see
 him try with no money.

112
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,892
You getting your
hair done today?

113
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,393
- No, just a manicure.

114
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,296
- So where you going tonight?

115
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,467
- I'm going to ask Thomas
 to take us to Curry's.

116
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,136
- Curry's, why can't
 you go somewhere nice?

117
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,972
- 'Cause he can't
 afford it right now.

118
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,273
- Forget what he can
 afford, if I were you,

119
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,775
I would put my foot down.

120
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,476
- Well you're not me so
don't worry about it.

121
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,278
- No you see I understand
 how they think.

122
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,980
They think that if they
 can get the goods for free

123
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,348
then why pay for
 it, if I were you

124
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,651
I'd put my services
 on strike until

125
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,152
he came up with some money.

126
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,888
I bet he finds some then.
 - Do you hear how you sound?

127
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,389
I am not a prostitute.

128
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,092
- That doesn't have anything
 to do with prostitution,

129
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,494
just don't settle for less.

130
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,733
(laughing)

131
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,267
- What man, what?

132
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,603
Look man, she's totally into
 me I just want to make sure

133
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,104
she's satisfied man.

134
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,972
- Spoony, Spoony, I can't
 believe you really think

135
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,373
that shit is gonna work.

136
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,509
- Look man when I pop
 a woody, and old girl

137
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,812
gotta play like Paul Bunyan,
 you're gonna be asking me

138
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,347
if you can have some and
 I aint gonna get you none.

139
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,548
- I don't think so,
 I don't think so

140
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,017
besides how you
 gonna buy this shit.

141
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,485
You don't look 21, you don't
 have a drivers license.

142
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,855
- Look man I got all that
 shit taken care of okay.

143
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,257
Let me show you, let
 me show you something.

144
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,125
Bam (laughs).

145
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,961
- Oh yeah that
 should do the trick.

146
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,362
- Yeah.

147
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,797
- Don't you think
 that's a bit extreme?

148
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,733
- Look man Spoony do
 anything to get a nut off,

149
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,135
anything, I'll be
 right back all right.

150
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,237
- It don't even look
real, what is that shit,

151
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,504
piece of you momma's rug?

152
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,981
- Can I help you?

153
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,984
- Yeah I'd like to
 buy some Mr Big Cream,

154
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,586
it's for my little brother
 he's out in the car.

155
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,121
- Small, medium or large?

156
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,393
- Which size do I need
to get about 10 inches.

157
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,796
- Hmm, how long is it now?

158
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,900
- Just give me the
 large will yah.

159
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,601
- Sure, here you go.

160
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,177
- Thank you.
 - Sure.

161
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,645
- Hasta la vista.

162
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,184
It's time to go bust Jimmy man.

163
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,721
- So how long before
this stuff takes effect?

164
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,257
- I don't know I gotta go home
 and read the instructions.

165
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,059
- I can't wait to
 see how it works.

166
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,195
- See?

167
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,530
You better go ask
 old boy how it works,

168
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,365
he aint seeing shit.

169
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,701
- Boy shut up, let's go.

170
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,235
- See how it works?

171
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,708
(smooth music)

172
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,946
- Hey.
 - Hey.

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,848
It's a good movie.

174
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,820
- So, are we still
 going out tonight?

175
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,856
- You know I was
thinking maybe we should

176
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,358
take a rain check tonight, I
 don't think I can afford it.

177
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,795
- Thomas you promised
me we'd go out tonight.

178
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,598
- Yeah I know but hey,
 what am I gonna do,

179
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,601
you don't have it,
 you don't have it.

180
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,206
- You'd have it if you
went to work sometimes.

181
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,975
- How much money do you have?

182
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,376
- Why is it that
 every time we go out

183
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,879
I have to chip in or
pay for the whole thing?

184
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,514
- Come on now, get with
 the program, it's the 90s.

185
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,583
- I don't care what year it
 is, why can't you be a man

186
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,886
sometimes and treat
 me like a lady?

187
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,389
- Hey man, wait a minute,
 what does my being a man

188
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,224
have to do with taking you out?

189
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,228
- Look I'm sorry, it's just
 that you don't even try

190
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,696
to do things for me.

191
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,132
- Valerie come on you know
 how much money I make.

192
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,871
- Honey there has got
 to be more to life

193
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,206
then you making $6 an hour
 and hanging on the street

194
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,341
with your friends drinking.

195
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,276
- You only make $9.

196
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,112
- At least I'm trying.

197
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,315
- Hey come, I'm trying too,
 it's just easier for you.

198
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,717
- Oh yeah here we go again,
 it's easier for a woman.

199
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,920
- It is easier for a
 woman, you know that.

200
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,756
And you know I always try.

201
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,159
All right, all right,
 all right, all right,

202
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,127
where you wanna go?

203
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,966
- Anywhere except Burger King,
 I'll let you choose the place

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,501
- Yeah well I'll surprise you,

205
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,405
at least you aint got to be
 in the kitchen burning shit.

206
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,507
(laughs)

207
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,246
(suspenseful music)

208
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,049
- Hey yeah.

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,903
(screaming)

210
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,475
Fuck that.

211
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,288
- So Carl, just why did you
 become a Jehovah's Witness?

212
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,458
- Because it eliminated
a lot of the confusion

213
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,860
in my life.

214
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:13,793
- Yeah how so?

215
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,999
- Well, when you live by
 God's word, life's heavenly.

216
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,168
- Life's heavenly huh.

217
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,171
Well listen tell me,
 what would you do

218
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,472
in a situation like this right?

219
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,574
You're involved with
this woman and she knows

220
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,678
what your financial situation
 is yet she still insists

221
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,181
that you take her to the most
 expensive restaurant around,

222
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,049
what would you do?

223
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,384
- Am I married to this woman?

224
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,519
- No, no.

225
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,623
- Well I'd tell
 her to seek Jesus.

226
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,560
(laughs)

227
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,598
- You would, I'm sorry you
 don't have a woman now do you?

228
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:55,302
- Gentlemen, a little less talk
and more productivity here.

229
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,669
- Yes ma'am.

230
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:57,670
- Hello Carl.

231
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,638
- Good afternoon.

232
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,273
- Thomas, is everything okay.

233
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,308
- Yeah.

234
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,142
- You sure?

235
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,610
- Yeah.

236
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,678
- All right then well
 let's get busy here okay.

237
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:14,888
- She's quite a lady, she
 belongs to the AME church.

238
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,491
If she was a Witness
I'd try to talk to her.

239
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,660
- Why's she gotta be a Witness?

240
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,662
- You don't mix the
 devil with Jehovah.

241
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,233
- Carl, you shouldn't
 condemn people

242
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,335
just 'cause they're
 a different religion.

243
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,870
- Well all I know is
 there's only one way

244
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,205
to become a righteous man.

245
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,341
- Yeah right.

246
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,442
- Look I'm gonna go try Jack.

247
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:37,911
- Good luck.

248
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,049
- [Carl] Want to come to
 one of the Witness meetings?

249
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:42,916
- Hell no.

250
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,853
(knocking on door)

251
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,955
- Who is it?
 - Carl.

252
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,691
- Carl who?

253
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,593
- [Carl] Carl from
 merchandising sir.

254
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,729
- Oh Carl, come on in.

255
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,300
How you doing Carl?

256
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,302
- Hi.
 - Have a seat.

257
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,239
How can I help you Carl?

258
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,475
- [Carl] I have a
 cousin Rosemary,

259
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,144
she's a singer and I was
 wondering if you could do

260
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,946
a story on her.

261
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,614
- Carl is she top 40?

262
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,249
- [Carl] No sir.

263
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,750
- Does she have a video out?

264
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,986
- [Carl] No.

265
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,220
- Then she can't
 sell my magazine.

266
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,256
- [Carl] I was thinking
maybe you could do

267
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,392
just a little article
 on her in the back.

268
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,731
- No, how many times do
I have to teach you all

269
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,468
that I am not in the business
 of trying to make stars.

270
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,337
I exploit them once they're big.

271
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,973
Now get the hell out of here,

272
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,509
and keep saying to
 yourself all day

273
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:47,414
that exploitation of stars
 is money, money, money.

274
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,551
Close the door behind you Carl.

275
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,825
(car horns blaring)

276
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,593
- See I'm telling you man,
 if Jesse had won the election

277
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,862
this world would
 be a better place.

278
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,832
- Oh yeah, how's that BJ?

279
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,601
- We would have
 someone on the inside

280
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,337
to look after our needs.

281
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,243
- Man that black,
white shit is so tired.

282
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,882
BJ, our needs as you like to
 put it will be looked after

283
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,018
when we stop being
 so complacent,

284
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,454
start taking some
 control of our lives.

285
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,958
I'm a tell you the truth
man I voted for Bush.

286
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,094
Yeah, Bush, you know why,

287
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:39,032
'cause Bush has the
 tendency to look after

288
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:43,336
those of us who know how
to look after ourselves,

289
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,473
and I might add that might
 have just a little bit to do

290
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,209
with why I'm standing
 here getting rich,

291
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,080
and you, you're over
 there behind that counter,

292
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,915
complaining like a bitch.

293
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,350
- Look man it figures
 you would think that

294
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,419
but you know what
 individual success

295
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,821
doesn't mean anything
 compared to the collective.

296
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,623
Sure you get you a couple
 of toms who they let

297
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,459
slip through the cracks and
 then give them a few crumbs.

298
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,196
- Tom, man who
 you calling a tom?

299
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,465
- You, you the one always
 bent over for the white man.

300
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,568
- Hey er, boys, boys, what's up?

301
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,736
- Hey Thomas.

302
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,138
- What's going on Thomas?

303
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,107
- Nothing much, listen--

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,309
- No nothing much at all,
 we just here listening

305
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,845
to Marcus Larvae over here,
 he's just taken another enema

306
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,380
and he's spreading that
back to Africa shit

307
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,815
all over the place again.

308
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,982
- Yeah, yeah, well that's
 real nice but I need

309
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,384
a little favor.

310
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,719
You see I need to
 borrow a little money,

311
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,555
okay, a lot of money,
 well $100 you know,

312
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,523
I gotta take Val out tonight.

313
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,925
- Ah what is it, her birthday?

314
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,562
- No man, you see this class
 thing it's kind of contagious

315
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,030
and our friend here he's
been hanging around me

316
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,266
for a little while and I
do believe I'm starting

317
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,834
to rub off on him.

318
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,437
He wants to explore some of the
finer things in life tonight

319
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,605
- No Alex we just wanna go out.

320
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,775
- Man can't you take her
 somewhere more affordable?

321
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,478
- You know that is
 a serious infraction

322
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,746
of the perpetration laws.

323
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,350
- You know something
 Alex you're deep.

324
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,084
No man I'm just trying to
 take her somewhere nice

325
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,420
because I guess I'm a
little overdue you know.

326
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,324
- You know what man, I had a
 lady pull that one me once.

327
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,959
Wanted me to take her
 to this restaurant

328
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,428
that she saw on television,
 I told her to get that

329
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,830
media hype out there of
 how we're supposed to eat

330
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,733
steak out of her mind,
 go into the kitchen

331
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,336
and make us some tofu
 or she can leave.

332
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,405
- What she do?

333
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,607
- She left.

334
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,776
(laughs)

335
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,879
- Breakfast, lunch and
dinner, BJ the poor girl

336
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,882
probably just couldn't
 eat another bean pie.

337
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,750
- No, no, no man she was a
 down sister when I met her.

338
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,852
But see then my
 business went down

339
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,589
and she had to go get
 one of them downtown jobs

340
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,791
then she started meeting
them shells of men,

341
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,395
well dressed, looking
 good with a nice car,

342
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,564
and then she turned into a
 handkerchief head like you.

343
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,335
- What you mean is she
 developed some taste and class

344
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,337
which is a good thing
 because as I recall

345
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,440
she was one ugly sister.

346
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,741
- Man you wouldn't
 know a beautiful woman

347
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,743
if she slapped you in your face.

348
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:07,947
- Tap, what am I, am I good
 for the money here or what?

349
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:14,354
- Look man, I got
 $34 I can give you.

350
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,224
- There's 16 I wouldn't pay
 a penny more for that heifer.

351
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,595
- Thank you Alex, fuck you Alex.

352
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,697
Thanks BJ.

353
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,932
I'll see you later.

354
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,801
- Okay, hey Thomas
 coming to my rally.

355
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,637
- Yeah, yeah I be there.

356
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,872
- You'll probably be
the only one there too.

357
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,293
- Do you have a reservation sir?

358
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,931
- Uh yeah, Weinstein.

359
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,237
- It just so happens that
 we have a cancellation

360
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,973
but next time I do suggest
 that you make a reservation.

361
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,009
- There won't be a next time.

362
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,616
- Why you always
 gotta embarrass me?

363
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,320
- Well I'm going to work
for everything I want,

364
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,121
I don't need a man
 to take care of me.

365
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,791
- No Paula you're going to
 work for everything you get

366
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,192
because you have too.

367
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,395
- Why won't you
 just lay off Paula?

368
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,196
- I just don't like the
accusation she makes,

369
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,298
she's too jealous.

370
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,566
- Oh jealous of what?

371
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,868
It's just that my body
 isn't up for sale.

372
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,671
- That's because don't
 nobody want to buy it.

373
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,240
- Are y'all gonna
 play cards or what?

374
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,210
- She's just pissed
 because I'm tall,

375
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,680
I have long pretty
hair, I can wear Spandex

376
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,550
and I'm lighter then you.

377
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:55,555
- Sharon, you're a whore, and
 you make all women look bad

378
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,358
and you need to stop.

379
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,793
- Don't blame me for
 making you look bad.

380
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,496
(phone ringing)

381
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,267
- Hello.

382
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:13,306
Oh sure Alex, when
 will you be by?

383
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,176
Uh huh, see you then.

384
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,315
That was Alex, you
 remember the rich guy,

385
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,784
the one with the Corvette.

386
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,219
The one that said
 you look like a turd.

387
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,757
- I see he knows who
 to call when he gets

388
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,860
a little extra money
and wants a little sex.

389
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,428
- Why don't you and
 your ugly ass momma

390
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,565
just get on the bus and work
 your fingers to the bone okay.

391
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,167
- We'll do that.

392
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:46,906
- Guess what.
 - What?

393
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,947
- Guess.

394
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,986
- You want lobster now.

395
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,388
- Now see I don't even
 wanna tell you now.

396
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,856
- I'm joking, I'm
 joking, come on, come on,

397
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,324
tell me, what, what.

398
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,060
- I got the promotion.

399
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:12,031
- Yes, that's great, that's
 great congratulations.

400
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,501
- Now I'll be making
 $35,000 a year.

401
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,169
- Whoa, wow, you
 can buy me that car.

402
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,671
- No.

403
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:21,408
- Come on, come on, that's
 excellent, that's excellent.

404
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,276
You deserve it, you worked
 really hard, I'm proud of you.

405
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,347
- The boss took me out to
 this real fancy lunch today.

406
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,117
- You what, your boss
 took you to lunch?

407
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,986
- He is 40 years old and
 married, don't worry about it.

408
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,357
- Okay, okay.
 - So.

409
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,727
Have you been thinking about
 what you want to do yet?

410
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,433
- No I still really
 haven't figured it out yet.

411
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:50,236
- Well, I can't wait
 till you figure it out

412
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,539
'cause once you do we
can start on the future.

413
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,185
- Welcome to Pierre's
 may I help you?

414
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,087
- I need a touch up
 and please hurry.

415
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:13,325
- You've never been here
 before, I never forget a perm,

416
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,127
what's your name?
 - Sharon.

417
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,165
- Sharon what happened
 to your last dresser?

418
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,367
- He's not in, he's
 in Paris for the month

419
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,803
and I have some
 place to go tonight.

420
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,506
- Let's see how
 beautiful I can make you.

421
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,608
- Pierre I have
 something to tell you.

422
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,842
- What is it?

423
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:30,743
- Bend down.

424
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,616
Be careful I have an extension.

425
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,284
- You mean a weave.

426
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,087
- You know, you have a
lot of tacky tacky nerve

427
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,823
to bust me out in front of
 your customers like that.

428
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,459
- Talk about tacky,
look at this tacky weave

429
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:47,960
you brought up in here.

430
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,396
If God wanted the shit to be
 long, the shit would be long.

431
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,765
- You know I do not have
 to take this abuse from you

432
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,101
I have other places
 I can spend my money

433
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,603
and I think I will go find one.

434
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,704
I know where the door is.

435
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,538
- Then use it.

436
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,009
(smooth jazz music)

437
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,746
- Pierre you are too raw.

438
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,882
- I'm not raw, I just
 don't play that shit.

439
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,819
If you gonna wear
 a weave be proud,

440
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,787
don't go around trying
 to trick people.

441
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,393
(smooth jazz music)

442
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,634
- No bus yet.

443
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,373
- I cannot believe
 I am standing here

444
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,175
all dressed up
 waiting for the bus.

445
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,846
- Rain, rain, rain, rain, why
 you always got to complain?

446
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,614
Besides where's
 your car Miss It?

447
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,849
- I knew you were
 gonna say that.

448
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,717
Look I'm not trying
 to cause a fight.

449
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,987
- Valerie look I know you
 think I'm walking through life

450
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,556
with blinders on but I'm not.

451
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,192
Hey I see what's out here
 but it's hard all right.

452
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,261
Why can't you just
 be satisfied, content

453
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,495
with what you got right now.

454
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,231
- Content, I am so
tired of being content.

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,869
What's gonna happen
 when we get married?

456
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,539
- I thought we'd live
 happily ever after.

457
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,040
- And how are we supposed
 to give our children

458
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,609
a better life if all
 you're living for is today

459
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,177
and not for the future.

460
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,181
- Man being with marriage
 you've got kids now come on.

461
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,217
- Oh I'm sorry we're just
 supposed to fuck all our lives

462
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,652
and never make a commitment.

463
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,556
- Well you know
honestly I never really

464
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,357
gave it that much thought.

465
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,600
- So Thomas where is
this relationship going?

466
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,638
- One step at a time is good
 for me, how's that grab you?

467
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,979
- Where did he take you?

468
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:51,651
- We went to the French
 Riviera, it was so wonderful.

469
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:55,487
- Dave took me to
 Barbados for my vacation.

470
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,925
- Valerie what did
 you say the name

471
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,392
of your boyfriend was again?

472
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,695
- Thomas.

473
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,365
- Where did you and Thomas
 go on your last vacation?

474
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,910
(doorbell ringing)

475
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,284
- Who is it?

476
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,987
- It's Pierre is Valerie home?

477
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,623
- No she isn't.

478
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,725
- Well she'll be home
 in a few minutes,

479
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,326
do you mind if I wait?

480
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,394
- Yes I do.

481
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,065
- Go have a seat.

482
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,238
Go have a seat.

483
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,740
- No, no, no I aint
 here for that sister,

484
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,641
all I want is some
 rubbers that's it.

485
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,743
- I can't hear you.

486
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,648
- I said all I want is some
 rubbers and I'm out of here.

487
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,583
- Could you speak
 up I can't hear you.

488
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:37,156
- Damn, all right you trying
 to bust me, all right.

489
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,358
I said I'm getting
 some ass tonight

490
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,493
and I need some rubbers.

491
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,796
(laughing)

492
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,405
What?

493
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,517
- Thomas why didn't you
let Pierre in the door?

494
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,619
- Hey I was taking a shower
 I didn't want him in here

495
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,955
roaming around.

496
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,723
- You aint got shit I want.

497
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,291
- Yeah well I was
 just making sure.

498
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,795
- You are so childish, oh
 yeah I called your work today.

499
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,932
- Well I was tired,
 so I took half a day.

500
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,269
(burps)

501
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,170
- Disgusting.

502
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,739
- I'm sorry.

503
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,440
- You don't have to
 apologize for that.

504
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,176
- He is so
 frustrating sometimes.

505
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,011
- I told you what
 to do about it.

506
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,480
- I don't want to have this
 conversation again okay.

507
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,353
- Going to the store,
 you want anything?

508
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,855
- No.

509
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,757
- You don't have
 to be so damn rude,

510
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,393
you see me sitting here
I might want something.

511
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:54,466
- Here, suck on that,
 should hold you over

512
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,935
till this evening.

513
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,870
(laughs)

514
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,338
- He is so tired.

515
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,708
Like I was about to say to
 you, you have been seeing

516
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,343
the wrong type of man.

517
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,445
- What kind of man
 should I be seeing?

518
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,413
- Valerie sit down.

519
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,818
You need to get you a rich man.

520
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,052
- I knew you were
 gonna say that.

521
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,253
- With a rich man you
 don't have to worry

522
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,188
about being embarrassed
or anything.

523
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,590
- That is the most ridiculous
 thing I've ever heard.

524
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,726
Men are men, they're dogs.

525
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,028
Probably wouldn't have
 anything in common

526
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,495
with a rich guy anyway.

527
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,431
- Like you have something
 in common with Thomas.

528
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,566
- Yeah that's right.

529
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,872
I don't know, we used to
have so much in common

530
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,842
but it's like he doesn't
 care about anything anymore.

531
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,544
- See rich men believe in
 old fashioned tradition

532
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:42,381
of treating a woman like
a lady, with respect.

533
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,150
- Now how would you know?

534
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,618
- You don't think I go
 out with broke men do you?

535
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,189
- I don't know what to do.

536
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,492
- Look there's a party
 coming up for the Gold Coast

537
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,296
Single Club, there'll be lots
 of single rich men there.

538
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,133
- I cannot do that.

539
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,069
- If you don't like
 it, you can leave.

540
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:12,444
- Well, maybe it
 wouldn't hurt anyway.

541
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,251
(suspenseful music)

542
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,191
- Yo Spoony.

543
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:27,927
- What up yo?

544
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,095
- Give me two.

545
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,863
- Dry or lubricated?

546
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:31,730
- Lubricated.

547
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,236
- That's $7 my brother.

548
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,740
You only gonna crack two huh?

549
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,010
- It's a start I just met her.

550
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,377
- Get it for me
 one time black man.

551
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:46,212
- Sure will.

552
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,814
- Sexy money.

553
00:30:55,988 --> 00:31:00,893
- Thomas look at that.

554
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,933
- That looks boring.

555
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,718
Oh check this out, see that?

556
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,091
- Thomas?

557
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,198
- Oh come on Valerie,
 $2 for a flower

558
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,934
that's gonna die tomorrow,
 I don't think so.

559
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,778
- I wonder where they're going?

560
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,948
- Going to work,
 that mans a waiter.

561
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:56,949
- You're so romantic.

562
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,217
- Come on let's go home.

563
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,221
Oh yeah, oh yeah

564
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,894
oh baby, oh baby,

565
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:11,930
oh yeah.

566
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,137
(groaning with pleasure)

567
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,753
- Hey, hey baby what's wrong?

568
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,620
- Nothing.

569
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,858
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

570
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:16,728
- Come on baby, tell
 me what's wrong.

571
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,699
- Why would you think
there's something wrong?

572
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,501
- You know I've been with
 you for eight months now,

573
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,703
and I know that
 something is wrong.

574
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,705
- Surprised you're
 that sensitive.

575
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,111
- What are you trying to say?

576
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,013
- I'm tying to say you're
 over there huffing and puffing

577
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,149
like you conquered the
 world or something.

578
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,787
- Damn Val you bitch
 about everything,

579
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,055
I just finished.

580
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,091
- Yeah I know what
 you just finished.

581
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:45,957
What about me?

582
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,663
- You didn't, you didn't--

583
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,931
- No I didn't.

584
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,367
I mean do I ever?

585
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:59,538
- Now that's a fucked
 up thing to say.

586
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,739
You see I thought you did.

587
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,007
- That's because
 all you think about

588
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,709
is satisfying yourself.

589
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,412
I mean as bad as
 things are between us

590
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,714
you think that I could at
 least be sexually satisfied.

591
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,049
I mean the way I see it
 that's all you're good for

592
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,384
and you can't even do that.

593
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,922
- You know something
 you can really be

594
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,158
a serious bitch sometimes.

595
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,293
What the fuck am
 I supposed to do?

596
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,368
- You can try thinking
 about my needs sometimes.

597
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,241
- All right, all
right I'm sorry.

598
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,345
Listen just give me a
 few minutes all right

599
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,547
and I'll work it back up.

600
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,483
- You don't need a few minutes.

601
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,557
- Well it's not like I got an
 on and off switch you know.

602
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,925
- You can do something else.

603
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,164
- Something else like what?

604
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,799
- You know.

605
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,334
- What?

606
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:07,373
- You know.

607
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,576
- Valerie have you
 lost your mind?

608
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,446
Have you fucking, I just
finished fucking you.

609
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,219
- Fucking me, you know
 what you're exactly right,

610
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:23,722
you did just finish fucking
 me, satisfying yourself.

611
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:29,328
- I can't believe how
 crazy you are girl.

612
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,363
I mean you know how
 nasty that shit is?

613
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:32,931
- Yeah about as nasty as
 having somebody on top of you

614
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,200
who don't know what
 the fuck he's doing.

615
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,467
- Hey, hey, I can
 say what you want,

616
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:38,103
but I ain't doing
 that nasty shit.

617
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,638
- Yeah well fine, you
 don't ever have to have sex

618
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,173
with me again, it's not
 like I'm getting anything

619
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,374
out of it anyway.

620
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,109
Why don't you just turn
your poor ass around

621
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,010
and go to sleep.

622
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,381
- Why you always got
 to throw that shit in?

623
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:51,317
- Because you're a
 broke motherfucker.

624
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,741
* Lets treat each
 other with respect *

625
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,445
- So as you already know
 I had to call this meeting

626
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,314
because our sales are
down 2.3 million dollars

627
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,884
from last quarter,
 and Jack isn't happy.

628
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,388
And this morning he said
 that he will be laying off

629
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,291
a few people within
 the next 30 days.

630
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,460
These are your
 performance records,

631
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,028
they'll give you an
 indication of what you did

632
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:40,732
last quarter, what you
didn't do this quarter,

633
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:44,202
and where we expect you to
 be by the end of the month.

634
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,838
It will also give you a good
 indication as to whether

635
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,909
your job is in jeopardy,
and if you are in danger

636
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,712
you have 30 days to get
back on the right track.

637
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:57,182
Now I suggest that
 we work real hard

638
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,050
to bring those
 performance levels up.

639
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,954
I wish each of you good
 luck, and let's get to work.

640
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,296
Thomas I'd like to speak
with you for a moment.

641
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,162
- Yeah sure.

642
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,540
- Thomas I'm particularly
 concerned about you

643
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,175
because your performance levels
have been so far below par

644
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,413
that it's almost a cinch that
 you're going to get fired.

645
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,518
Thomas, what do you have
to say for yourself?

646
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:35,454
- Well I've just, I don't know,

647
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,255
been having a lot
 of problems lately.

648
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,824
- It's been more
 then just lately,

649
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,492
your performance levels
have been down now

650
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,160
for several months.

651
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,596
- Yeah I don't know, I
 don't know, I don't know.

652
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,401
- Thomas, did you know
 that your placement scores

653
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,103
ranked you in the top 25%?

654
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,639
- No I didn't know that.

655
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,308
- Well they did, and
 based on that information

656
00:37:56,342 --> 00:38:00,078
quite frankly I'm real
 disappointed in you.

657
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,917
Thomas if there's anything
 that I can do to help

658
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,421
please let me know, okay.

659
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:11,990
Okay.

660
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,726
- Okay.

661
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,961
- Now let's get to work.

662
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,337
- I tell you man Alex
 got it going on man.

663
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:28,507
He got these fine sisters man.

664
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,876
- Man, he's as lost as hell bro.

665
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,678
- Lost in that
 looked good to me.

666
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,680
- Them gold diggers, as
 soon as his money runs out

667
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:37,716
so will they, he be hanging
 out with Martha over there.

668
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,486
- That?

669
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,787
She foul man.

670
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,490
Her hairs so nappy Moses
 couldn't put a part in it.

671
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:47,292
- Your brothers got
 a lot to learn man.

672
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,797
- Yeah, yeah.
 (doorbell ringing)

673
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,664
That's ugly man.

674
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,834
- [Thomas] Who is it?

675
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,869
- It's me and Baby Malcolm.

676
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,270
- [Thomas] Yeah well
I'm having a discussion

677
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,072
I'll be right down.

678
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:01,940
- All right.

679
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,445
(sexy romantic music)

680
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:14,386
- Val please, don't go out
tonight, not tonight all right.

681
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,054
- Don't be stupid,
nothing is gonna happen

682
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,255
to your job tonight.

683
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,959
- I just think we should be
 together tonight, that's all.

684
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,861
- Oh yeah well what about
 the times when I needed you

685
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,797
and you were out with your
friends hanging in the streets.

686
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,266
- I can't believe that
 you're comparing this

687
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,002
time of crisis to some
 stupid shit like that.

688
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,573
- It wasn't stupid
 to me, excuse me.

689
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,809
- Valerie.
 - No.

690
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:38,677
- Valerie.

691
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,782
(doorbell ringing)

692
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,417
- [Valerie] That you Pierre?

693
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,418
- Yeah it's Pierre.

694
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,723
- Yo P man, let me
 ask you a question.

695
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,692
What's a brother like
 you do for fun man?

696
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,193
- You'll never know.

697
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,162
- Oh man why you gotta get
 all smart and shit man.

698
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,798
I bet you go to the
 deli and like pick up

699
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,801
a roll of salami right, run
 around to the drug store

700
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,103
and get a tube of Vaseline
 and you and the girls

701
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,472
make sandwiches all night.

702
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,007
- Look you don't need to
worry about my evenings,

703
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,841
what about yours?

704
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,477
- No problem man.

705
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,410
- You baby, let's
 pick up a 40 ounce,

706
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,945
get a two piece chicken dinner,

707
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,482
take it back to the
crib, turn on the radio

708
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,484
and if you can find
 it and I can get it up

709
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,118
we'll both get
 some tonight, word.

710
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,419
- Well that's real funny.

711
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,156
- Punk motherfucker.

712
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,259
You know what you're
 doing to our women?

713
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,695
- Yeah nothing.

714
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:33,064
- Listen man with the shortage
 we need all of our men

715
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,001
for the survival of the race.

716
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,403
- That's funny, the women
 I talk too don't complain

717
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,839
about the shortage, they
 complain about the black men

718
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,007
not being about shit.

719
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,144
- What are you
 saying man anyway?

720
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:51,082
- I see a strength, I
 see a side of manhood

721
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,183
that most people never see.

722
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,152
- Yeah the back side.

723
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,122
- Love, trust, respect,
qualities that surpass

724
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,191
a black man stereotype, I
 have found in my brothers.

725
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,293
And if you're lucky enough
 to find these qualities

726
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,263
in someone man or woman,
 I suggest you hold onto it

727
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,532
and be proud.

728
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:07,833
- Valerie, Valerie.
 - Let go.

729
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,300
- Are you ready?

730
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,401
- Let's go, hello BJ.

731
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,770
- Hello Valerie.

732
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,775
- That's fucked up you know
 that, that's really fucked up.

733
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,077
- What's that man, Valerie
 going out with Pierre?

734
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,746
- No man the fact
 that I can lose my job

735
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,048
any day and she's
 going out partying.

736
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,918
- Hey guys, what's going on?

737
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,087
- Working like clockwork man.

738
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,955
- Oh shit.

739
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,793
- Told yah, working
 like clockwork.

740
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,698
- And what does Mohammed
BJ have to speak about

741
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,567
on this fine night?

742
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,870
- What I'm speaking about
 man is by the year 2000

743
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:48,840
70% of our brothers gonna
 be unemployed, in jail,

744
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,442
homosexuals or on drugs.

745
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,179
- Where does he get
 this nonsense from?

746
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,247
- It's not nonsense man, so
 you need to educate yourself.

747
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,584
They already said that
 the best place to hide

748
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,151
information from a
 brother is between

749
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,319
the pages of a book.

750
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,690
- Well, at least one
thing we know is I'm in

751
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,592
that 30% percentile.

752
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,127
- What difference does it
 make if you don't reach back?

753
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,396
- I was kind of
thinking man, you know,

754
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,464
you be sounding right
 sometimes you know,

755
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,266
'cause I don't be doing
shit half the time

756
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,369
and I could be doing something
 a little better you know.

757
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:22,708
- Trifling, simply trifling man.

758
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,576
Do you know what I see
when I look at you guys?

759
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,344
- No Alex what do you see?

760
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,881
- Tell you what I see, what
 I see is a bunch of lazy,

761
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:34,920
self defeatist, slave
mentality type niggers.

762
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,857
Who don't have the gumption,
 or let me break this down

763
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,560
for Mr Spoony over
 here, the balls,

764
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,664
to pick themselves up and do
 something with their lives.

765
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,066
- Too bad for us because
you've been brainwashed

766
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,435
to run from that
 which is real man.

767
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,269
- Real?

768
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,339
What the hell you talking
 about with this real stuff?

769
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:57,676
Everything about me is real BJ.

770
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:02,614
I mean just today I pulled me
 another Caucasian persuasion.

771
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,752
- So what's that
 supposed to mean Alex?

772
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,086
- Come on get with it Thomas.

773
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,856
What is means is I'm
extraordinary because it's quite

774
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,125
obvious that not every
brother can have himself

775
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,360
a white woman.

776
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:16,895
- Hey you're right cause
they're gold diggers,

777
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,597
they go after you simple
brothers with money.

778
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,333
(laughing)

779
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,869
- I can sure smell the
 jealousy in the air tonight.

780
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,675
- That's not jealousy,
you just don't see dogs

781
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,943
mating with cats and
 cats mating with rats,

782
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,912
and all that kind of stuff.

783
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,481
- BJ what is this dog,
cat, rat shit got to do

784
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,216
with who I'm sleeping with?

785
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,820
Man listen, I believe
 in a colorless world

786
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:46,157
and not you, you and
 especially not you

787
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,459
will tell me who to
 adorn myself with.

788
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:51,396
- See they got you to assimilate
to that kind of thinking.

789
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,464
- So how do they do that?

790
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,266
- Stop encouraging
 that motherfucker man.

791
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,134
God damn.

792
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,537
- That's all right
 I'll tell you,

793
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,940
it was back in the 70s
 when we had out unity

794
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,010
and they knew that in unity
 there was strength right.

795
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,012
So then they came in,
 they stripped us of it

796
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,880
so we all be like Alex.

797
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:11,850
- Whole lot of hot air
 out here but I'm still

798
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,618
not hearing how.

799
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,654
- I'll tell you how man,
it was back in the day

800
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,757
when we were learning
 who we really were.

801
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,893
(upbeat music)

802
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:24,662
- I told you Rosa Parks
did the right thing.

803
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,565
- You know you right
 man, and ever since

804
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,701
that incident happened we've
 been together in the struggle.

805
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:33,939
- Yep, we even got out own
 black movies coming out now.

806
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:37,142
Speaking of which I think
 it's time for that movie.

807
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,977
- Let's go and check
 this thing out.

808
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:50,555
Yeah bro, I wants me a
 Cadillac and a white bitch.

809
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,192
(laughing)

810
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:00,431
- Now that was the dumbest
 shit I have ever heard

811
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,266
in my life.

812
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:08,673
Thomas listen to me man,
 just forget about Valerie

813
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,243
she don't count, go out
here and get yourself

814
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,679
two or three of those little,

815
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,082
well you know the kind
 of jobs you can get.

816
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:20,151
Save yourself some money
 boy and then you'll go out

817
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:22,687
and find yourself a
new woman and this time

818
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,157
Alex promises you,
 you will keep her.

819
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,329
- Alex, yo my man,
 you don't have a clue.

820
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:39,570
- Hey Alex, remember
 you're black.

821
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,179
- Y'all talking that crazy
 shit man, I'm out of here.

822
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,650
- Hey Thomas, don't
 worry about it man,

823
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,886
things gonna be all right.

824
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,388
- I mean how could the
 bitch do this to me.

825
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,158
- See from what you just
 said I probably can tell you.

826
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,995
- Um Mark, I really need to
 talk to Pierre for one second,

827
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,364
can you excuse us, one minute?

828
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:15,740
- Why you introduce
 me to crazy people?

829
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,275
- What's wrong with
you, you could have gone

830
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,244
to see Rick James, I told
 you the man had big bank.

831
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,181
What is wrong with you?

832
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,350
- You saw how crazy Thomas
 was acting at the house.

833
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,551
- What's up?

834
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,053
- He's probably
 gonna lose his job.

835
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,491
Pierre look, that guys
 been looking at me

836
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,026
ever since we sat down.

837
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,961
- Which one?

838
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,395
- The one in the tan suit.

839
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,230
- But he's a--

840
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,498
- Yeah I know what he is.

841
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,602
- Look Thomas may
 not be the best,

842
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
but you want to do that?

843
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,141
- Why don't you go talk
to your friend Mark,

844
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,410
and maybe he'll come
 over here and talk to me.

845
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,545
(laughs)

846
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,483
* Maybe as soon as it seems

847
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:02,653
* Oh my lover,
 you are the last *

848
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:03,621
- Can I sit down?

849
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,423
- Yeah sure.

850
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:07,758
- Look lets just
 get to the point,

851
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,394
do you wanna go out some time?

852
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,929
- Yeah, I do.

853
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,730
- What's your name?

854
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:13,999
- Valerie.

855
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:15,700
- Valerie, Brandon.
- It's nice to meet you.

856
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,302
- Nice to meet you too.

857
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,469
Can I get you a drink?

858
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,171
- Yeah sure, Perrier water.

859
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:24,142
- Okay one Perrier
 and a beer please.

860
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,178
You know I'm here all the time,

861
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,713
I'm surprised I
 haven't seen you.

862
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,349
- Well this is the first time,
 I came with my friend Pierre.

863
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:32,217
- Oh.

864
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:36,254
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

865
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,123
Um, would you like to dance?

866
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,790
- Um, yeah sure.

867
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:40,658
- Great.

868
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:52,737
So what do you do?

869
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,940
- I'm a computer
 programmer for Comtex.

870
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:56,874
- Oh my God, what a small
 world, I handle their account.

871
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,310
- You're kidding, what
 are you a sales man?

872
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:00,811
- I'm a trader.

873
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,113
- Oh that's good.

874
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,782
- Yeah, it's got
 it's highs and lows.

875
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,492
- Looks like we have
 a short dance here.

876
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,860
Why don't you come over here
 and let me introduce you

877
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,861
to a friend of mine.

878
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,728
- Sure.

879
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,936
- Um Brandon this
 is my friend Pierre,

880
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,637
Pierre, Brandon.

881
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,639
- Hello, nice to meet you.

882
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,978
- Look Valerie, I gotta get
going but dinner tomorrow night?

883
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:33,911
- Sounds great.

884
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,646
- Great, let me get your number.

885
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,084
- Oh okay, um you know
 what why don't you give me

886
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,751
your card and I'll
 give you a call.

887
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:41,619
- Oh great, sure.

888
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,226
Here you go, so tomorrow
night eight o'clock.

889
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,094
- Sounds great.

890
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:52,363
- It's nice seeing
 you, nice meeting you.

891
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,864
- It was nice to meet you.

892
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:56,134
- And I'll talk to you tomorrow.

893
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,168
- Okay.

894
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,269
- Great, bye.

895
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:06,944
- That is mine.

896
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,321
(somber jazz music)

897
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,762
- I just wanted to let you
 know that was real selfish

898
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,164
what you did tonight.

899
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:05,470
- Selfish, you got a lot of
nerve calling somebody selfish.

900
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,173
You have to be the most
 selfish person I've ever met.

901
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,180
You know Thomas you have
 got to start doing something

902
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,215
with your life, I am
tired of you being a bum

903
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:18,416
all your life.

904
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,919
- Do me a favor and
just stop bitching at me

905
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,954
just for once, just
 for a minute here.

906
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,556
- You know what you're
 right, I'm sorry,

907
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,492
it's not like it
 does any good anyway.

908
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:33,564
- All right, all right, since
 you're so unhappy with me

909
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,967
why don't you just pack
your shit and leave?

910
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,239
Yeah that's right, you go
 ahead, you find somebody else

911
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:44,041
'cause I'm sick of this shit.
 - You're sick of this shit?

912
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,043
- Yeah.
 - Well then fine I will leave.

913
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,578
- Good, get the fuck out.

914
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,847
- Don't you even think it
 will be hard to replace you.

915
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,050
(fingers clicking)

916
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,319
- Just hurry it up bitch.

917
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,800
I can't believe you're
 really doing this,

918
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,302
especially at a time like this.

919
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:12,237
- What do you mean
 especially now?

920
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,704
- I'm losing my fucking job.

921
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,772
- So how long did you think
 they were gonna let you

922
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,274
just take off and mess up?

923
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:26,651
- Look, can we just um,

924
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:33,258
can we just try to
give this another shot?

925
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,160
I'll get my shit together
 baby, I just need you,

926
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,093
I need you.

927
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,300
I need you now more then I
 have ever needed you before.

928
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,578
- Thomas I'm sorry but
 it's like we're moving

929
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,780
in two different directions.

930
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,316
I need somebody who wants to
 do the same things that I do.

931
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,751
If I stayed here now
 you'd be fine today,

932
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,120
but next week you'd be
back to the same thing.

933
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,792
- Valerie, you gotta
give me another chance.

934
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,662
You gotta give me
another chance Valerie.

935
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:16,867
- Try not to be here tomorrow,
 I'll come get my stuff.

936
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,843
Thomas I really hope you
get your life together.

937
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,482
- Yeah.

938
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:42,059
- Seems as if this was
 bound to happen man.

939
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:42,927
- I don't know,

940
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,096
I just wish she hadn't left.

941
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,737
You think we could
 have worked it out?

942
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,240
- To be honest with you
 man Valerie was base level.

943
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:57,708
- Base level.

944
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,346
- Yeah see man, put people
 onto three levels right.

945
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,748
The first one is spiritual
 which I'll say is about

946
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,516
8% of the population.

947
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,618
See you get a woman on
this level and you'll be

948
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,320
happy forever.

949
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:11,322
- What are the other two levels?

950
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,157
- Well the second
 is the intellectual.

951
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,193
These are the people that try
 to apply logic to everything,

952
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,364
lot of book sense
 but no common sense.

953
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:22,199
Then the third is the
 base level person,

954
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,502
they're into cars
 and sex and money

955
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,504
and all that superficial stuff.

956
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,240
I hate to say it but this
 is the largest segment

957
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:30,174
of the population.

958
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,715
- Yo how much for the paper?

959
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:38,849
- 20 cent.

960
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,651
- 20?
 - 20 cents.

961
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,852
- 20?

962
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,254
- Yo man the man
 said 20, two dimes,

963
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,089
give the man the
money, damn man.

964
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,728
- Thank you brother.

965
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:02,807
- That brother looked like
 a cricket man didn't he?

966
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,208
All right, all right what up yo.

967
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,776
- Peace bro.

968
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,777
- Man I'm telling you man
 I'm taking you to this

969
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,613
going on ass party tomorrow man.

970
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,182
- Nah man, I don't feel
like going to a party.

971
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,652
- For like, man I know
you aint up and worried

972
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,153
about Val are you man?

973
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:20,090
- I just don't feel like
going to no party okay.

974
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,560
- Okay man look, I
 don't see why not.

975
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,196
I mean it's gonna be much,
 much, much ass there man.

976
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,999
I'm talking about ass,
 all over the place.

977
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:33,170
- Spoony, Spoony, see what
 I tell you, base level.

978
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,279
* We got to try to
 love one another *

979
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,615
* Do the right thing

980
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,851
* We got to try to
 love one another *

981
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:50,721
* Do the right thing

982
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:51,656
- You wrote this?

983
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,595
- Mother maybe that is
 a stereotype just like

984
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,096
the ones they have about us.

985
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,198
- I understand you
wanting to leave Thomas

986
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,434
but I just think you're
going off the deep end.

987
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:04,935
- Are you prejudice?

988
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,971
- No I'm not prejudice, I
 just know you're doing this

989
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,973
for the wrong reasons.

990
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,475
- What do you mean?

991
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:13,310
- Look Valerie if you just
 happened to meet a white man

992
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,414
and he was nice to you then
 you'd have my blessings.

993
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,248
You start telling me how
 they treat your coworkers

994
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,184
and I know you're
 tripping again.

995
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:28,125
- I am not tripping again.

996
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,827
How can you say that
 there's no difference?

997
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,829
- I'm not saying
 there's no difference

998
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,831
I'm just saying that any
 difference that you think

999
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:37,234
exists is more then individual
 thing and not a racial one.

1000
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,540
- Okay well we'll see, do
 you know where the vase is?

1001
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,675
- It's in the pantry,
 why do you need it?

1002
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,745
- For the flowers that
 Brandon's gonna bring me.

1003
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:48,779
- I thought when
 someone brings flowers

1004
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,081
it's usually a surprise.

1005
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,917
- Now see that's why
 I'm making the change,

1006
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,953
they always bring me
 flowers on the first date.

1007
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:58,556
- Oh please, I just hope
 you're not setting yourself up

1008
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:01,025
for a big let down.

1009
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,760
- Well mother when Brandon
 and I are in Europe

1010
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,861
I'll give you a call.

1011
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,451
- God bless you.

1012
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,384
(doorbell ringing)

1013
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,586
- Now see he's even on time.

1014
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,589
- He's probably anxious
to see if it's true.

1015
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:32,523
- If what is true?

1016
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,906
Hi, why don't you come
 in and meet my mother.

1017
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:49,774
- Great.

1018
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:55,345
- Mother this is Brandon,
 Brandon this is my mother.

1019
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,781
- Hello Mrs Young
 nice to meet you.

1020
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,449
- Oh my pleasure Brandon.

1021
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:00,551
Oh I have something for you.

1022
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,491
For you.

1023
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,492
- Thanks.

1024
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:08,959
- I'll take care
of this for you.

1025
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:13,564
- So where are you
 two going tonight?

1026
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,766
- To a restaurant or
 wherever she wants to go.

1027
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,235
- Sounds good.
 - Yeah.

1028
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,337
- Well don't let
 me hold you back.

1029
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,271
- It was nice meeting
 you Mrs Young.

1030
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,439
- Nice meeting you Brandon.

1031
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:23,974
- See you again sometime.

1032
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:26,210
- Maybe next time I can cook
 dinner for you and Valerie?

1033
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,211
- Sounds great.

1034
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:28,613
- Goodbye mother.

1035
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:29,480
- Night.

1036
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:42,226
- Yo sis what they get you for?

1037
00:57:42,259 --> 00:57:45,029
- Brandon, this is
 my brother Andre,

1038
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,964
he thinks he's a comedian.

1039
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:49,166
- Oh I get it I was
 supposed to be a police man,

1040
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,901
how funny, nice
 to meet you Andre.

1041
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:55,405
- I forget, how
 the heck are yah.

1042
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,674
- I'm all right, I'm all right.

1043
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:59,476
- Go on in the house,
 I will see you later.

1044
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,211
- Dope.
- Dope?

1045
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,247
Hey don't you think you're
 a little too young for that.

1046
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,281
- Huh funny.

1047
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:12,056
(upbeat dance music)

1048
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,430
- You know would
 you lighten up man,

1049
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,933
this is a party not a funeral.

1050
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,434
- Yeah I knew I shouldn't
 have come out here.

1051
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:26,904
I don't know how I let you
 talk me into this shit.

1052
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:29,640
- What up homey?

1053
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,986
Sit down man, sit down.

1054
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,325
I'm telling you man
 the honey's is here,

1055
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,995
and they all over the place
 so don't be slow driving.

1056
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,640
Check out old girl, she's fine.

1057
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,577
She got a trunk of funk.

1058
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:08,078
- She does look
 good doesn't she.

1059
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:09,680
- Yeah well that means you
 should go mack her down.

1060
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:11,215
Go on, go get her.

1061
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,420
Yeah, go on.

1062
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,366
I don't know what to say.

1063
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,601
You know how long it's been man.

1064
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:33,137
- Look Thomas I understand okay,

1065
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:38,142
but Valeries gone,
 her days are over.

1066
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:38,976
- Right Valerie's gone.

1067
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:39,844
- You need some yams.

1068
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,879
- All right.

1069
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,147
- Go get them.

1070
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,082
- All right, you're
 right, you're right.

1071
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,150
- Go get them.

1072
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,885
- I'm going.

1073
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,519
Do the right thing yeah.

1074
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:51,088
Do the black thing I'm going.

1075
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:51,956
- Go, go, go.

1076
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:57,127
* You don't have to worry

1077
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,865
- Hey how you doing?

1078
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,933
I'm Thomas, and I was er,

1079
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,603
well I was, and em--

1080
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,739
- Hi, my name is Shirley,

1081
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,676
would you like to
 buy me a drink?

1082
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,378
- A drink yeah, what are
 you, what are you drinking?

1083
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:15,579
- A sloe gin fizz.

1084
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,149
- Sloe gin fizz all
 right coming up.

1085
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:22,987
- Baby we should just
 go back to my crib

1086
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,322
and get busy I'm telling you.

1087
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,590
- But I don't know you.

1088
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,625
- Ooh baby that
 don't mean nothing.

1089
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,960
We can get acquainted
 back at my crib.

1090
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:31,696
- Someone as frank
 as you I don't think

1091
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:32,997
you can handle me anyway.

1092
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:40,337
- Slow gin fizz, Shirley,
 if I, if I put a move on you

1093
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,708
am I gonna get turned down?

1094
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:45,710
- It depends.

1095
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,879
- On what?

1096
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:49,947
- On how drunk I get.

1097
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,787
- Let me straighten
 you out baby.

1098
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,556
Jimmy's strapped
 with four big inches.

1099
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:10,300
- So have you ever gone out
 with anybody black before?

1100
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,602
- You know I haven't
 really on a kind of

1101
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:16,340
one on one basis but I have
 a lot of black friends.

1102
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,911
- So why'd you go out with me?

1103
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:23,380
- Why not I mean I
 find you attractive.

1104
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,281
- That's a good reason.

1105
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,787
I don't know if you could
 tell but my mother's

1106
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,455
a little apprehensive
 about us going out tonight.

1107
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:33,257
- Yeah so that's what's
 going on between you two huh.

1108
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,692
- Yeah I mean I told
 her, I said mother,

1109
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,394
it shouldn't make a difference
 what race somebody is.

1110
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,662
I mean we're all the same right.

1111
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,397
- You know, now that
 I think about it

1112
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,899
there might be a small
 difference here and there

1113
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,134
but I mean we don't have
 to let it get in our way.

1114
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,770
- No we're all God's children.

1115
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:46,603
- I agree.

1116
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,074
So tell me what
 do you like to do?

1117
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,878
- Go to the symphony.

1118
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:54,945
- Do you really?

1119
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,747
I love it, I love Danielle.

1120
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:58,048
- Oh yeah he's great.

1121
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:01,151
- You know, you're all right
 just like your brother.

1122
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,652
- Why?

1123
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:03,954
- Well she's one of the
 greatest conductors around

1124
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:05,422
and you call her a man.

1125
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,290
- Oh.

1126
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:09,459
- Look I'm sorry I
 didn't mean that,

1127
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:10,961
it's a bad habit of mine.

1128
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,966
- I really like shopping
at Neman Marcus.

1129
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,103
- I always thought they
 were a little overpriced.

1130
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,404
- Well you know they
 say you have to pay

1131
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:21,839
for the best things in life.

1132
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:24,274
- Guess you're right.

1133
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:30,380
Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean that.

1134
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,082
- Thomas used to do that.

1135
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:33,683
- Thomas?

1136
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,185
- My ex-boyfriend.

1137
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,387
- Hmm, so I take it that
 kind of thing bothers you.

1138
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,489
- I think it's disrespectful.

1139
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,226
- You know Valerie
 I never understood

1140
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,928
why women get so shook up
 over something like that.

1141
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,762
I mean it's just like if
you're looking at a car

1142
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,965
or something, it's not
 that big of a deal.

1143
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:49,466
- What you think that
 women are objects?

1144
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,735
- No it's just that I mean
 all women look different

1145
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,703
and as long as you
 don't lust, I mean,

1146
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:55,339
I don't see anything
 wrong with it.

1147
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,041
- Yeah I know I just
 figured that if a man

1148
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:59,944
is out with me he shouldn't
 be looking at anybody else

1149
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:02,146
and if he does maybe he
shouldn't be with me.

1150
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,781
- You're that jealous
kind of type aren't you?

1151
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:05,850
- No.

1152
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,684
- Yeah you are, I know you are.

1153
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,286
- Well maybe a little.

1154
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,154
- That's cute.

1155
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,959
- So what time do you go
to work in the morning?

1156
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:16,994
- Hmm, about 8:30.

1157
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,528
- Would you like to go
 for a walk in the morning?

1158
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:21,165
- Yeah that'd be
 great I'd love too.

1159
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:23,633
- What are you thinking about?

1160
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,135
- Nothing.

1161
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:27,704
- Come on you gotta be
 thinking about something.

1162
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,207
- Look what does nothing mean,
 I said nothing all right.

1163
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:37,381
- Could you please not twirl
 my hair I don't like it.

1164
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,183
I don't feel
 comfortable with it.

1165
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,185
(laughs)

1166
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,787
- You know something I
really don't give a fuck

1167
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,955
what you don't like .

1168
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:48,893
- What is your problem?

1169
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,028
- You.

1170
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,198
You're my problem,
 do me a favor,

1171
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,033
get the hell out of here.

1172
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,567
- What?

1173
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,604
- Just shut the fuck up and
 get the fuck out of here!

1174
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:09,313
- You know you are really
 sick, you are sick.

1175
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:18,122
(gentle piano music)

1176
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,597
- Now see that's another
thing about Thomas,

1177
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,466
he wasn't romantic at all.

1178
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,335
He thought it was
 stupid to go for walks

1179
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,170
and go to plays and
 stuff like that.

1180
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:37,407
- That's crazy, you know
Val it really seems like

1181
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,875
you weren't too
 satisfied with him.

1182
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:42,412
- Yeah that's right, now
 see, look at that building.

1183
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:45,315
That's exactly how I wanna
 live, penthouse apartment,

1184
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:49,386
doorman, big car, all
the best things in life.

1185
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,722
- Val that sounds great but
 how do you plan on getting

1186
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,757
all of these things?

1187
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,102
- Thomas I really hate
to have to tell you this

1188
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,773
but I was in Jack's office
 earlier this morning

1189
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:12,876
and I caught a glimpse
 of the pink slip list

1190
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:17,081
that he had on his desk, and
 your name is near the top.

1191
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:20,784
- Well you know
 something Michelle it
 really doesn't matter.

1192
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:24,654
- Thomas, you've either been
 a no show or late for work

1193
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,256
for the past two weeks.

1194
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,158
Now I don't know what it is
 that you're going through

1195
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:30,694
but it can't be the
 end of the world.

1196
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:35,465
- You don't understand,
Valerie left.

1197
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:38,202
- Valerie, who's Valerie?

1198
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,804
- Well she was my lady
till she got tired of me

1199
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,173
not being able to take her out
 and buy her expensive things

1200
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:45,809
so she left.

1201
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,645
- First of all, any
 woman who would leave you

1202
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,081
because you can't
 afford to take her out

1203
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,650
really isn't a woman.

1204
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,988
Secondly, this is a good
 company, and I would hate

1205
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,624
to see you tarnish your work
 record by getting fired.

1206
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:10,867
Thomas, there are some
 good women out here.

1207
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,871
But you have got to
 get your act together

1208
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,606
if you hope to meet one one day.

1209
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,210
As for right now you really
 shouldn't even be thinking

1210
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:23,713
about a lady, you should be
 focusing on getting your life

1211
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:27,117
in order, can you do that?

1212
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,854
Think about it okay.

1213
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,343
- Hey, thanks.

1214
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:57,114
- So is it true.

1215
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:58,815
- About this new guy?

1216
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,550
- What are you
 two talking about?

1217
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:02,819
- Lisa told me what he's like.

1218
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,853
- Oh I get it.

1219
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,091
- So what happened
 to what's his name?

1220
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:10,327
- Thomas, we're not
 seeing each other anymore.

1221
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,262
- So what does Brandon do?

1222
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:14,131
- Oh well he's a trader.

1223
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:17,000
- Sounds nice, have
 you been out yet?

1224
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,502
- Yeah he took me
 to dinner last night

1225
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,338
and then he took me for
a walk this morning.

1226
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,639
- Oh them were the good old days

1227
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:24,374
when George picked me up.

1228
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:26,143
Of course when he
 first started dating.

1229
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:27,877
- He stopped?

1230
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:31,448
- Of course he stopped,
all men do right?

1231
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:33,483
They wine and dine you at first

1232
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,619
and when they get
 used to you they stop.

1233
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,287
- Better enjoy it
 while it lasts.

1234
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,564
- What's up?

1235
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:51,067
- Whoa, so how was traffic?

1236
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:52,502
- The worse, the worse.

1237
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:54,371
- So what are we gonna do today?

1238
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,672
- I didn't tell you, I'm sorry,

1239
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:57,674
I'm gonna have to take
 a rain check today.

1240
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:00,009
I'm in a tennis match
 at the country club.

1241
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:00,844
- Well can I go?

1242
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,948
- Look maybe another time
 it's not a good time.

1243
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,683
- I wish you had told me I
 could have found a way home.

1244
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,585
- No it's okay, I can
 still give you a ride.

1245
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,488
Okay, so how was your day, good.

1246
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:12,889
- Very tiring.

1247
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,192
- All right I need to
 get to this rally man.

1248
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,261
- One more, one more,
just one more all right.

1249
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:18,962
- Come on man, let's go man.

1250
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,697
- All right, all
 right, all right.

1251
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,031
I was walking on the beach right

1252
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,533
getting high with
 some of the homies

1253
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:25,202
and we saw this
 female in the sand.

1254
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:27,237
She didn't have no
 arms, no legs right.

1255
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:28,972
So she called me over
 and says, excuse me

1256
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:31,341
I aint never been hugged before.

1257
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,577
So I figured she wanted a
 hug, I gave her a hug right.

1258
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,979
The next thing you know
she said, excuse me

1259
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,981
I aint never been kissed before.

1260
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,817
So I was like fuck it,
I give her a kiss right.

1261
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,986
Then she pulled me
 real down close to her

1262
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:46,823
and she was like, I aint
 never been fucked before.

1263
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,192
So I picked her up,
 threw her in the water

1264
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:49,659
and said you fucked now.

1265
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,928
(laughing)

1266
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,430
- All right man.
- Be cool.

1267
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,298
- Peace.

1268
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:57,167
- Brothers a fool man.

1269
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:02,539
(smooth jazz music)

1270
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:14,851
(car tires squealing)
 (car horn blaring)

1271
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,290
* Girl we've come so far

1272
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:24,228
* What about my heart

1273
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:29,266
* Don't you even care anymore

1274
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:37,106
* I can't believe you say

1275
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:41,911
* You've thrown it all away

1276
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:46,350
* As if there was
 no love ever there *

1277
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:50,687
* As if we never loved before

1278
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,991
* I never meant
 that much to you *

1279
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:59,463
* You believe you won't
stay to see it through *

1280
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:03,567
* Did you know you would
break my heart today *

1281
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,004
* And you tear it all apart
 and just throw it away *

1282
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,941
* I never knew that
 I could hurt so bad *

1283
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,077
* Never.

1284
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,212
(crying)

1285
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:30,594
* I never knew it
 would hurt so bad *

1286
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,697
* When I think about the
dirty love that we had *

1287
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:38,001
* Should have known when the
 fire wasn't in your eyes *

1288
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:41,538
* I was in too deep to realize

1289
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:45,442
* I didn't know

1290
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,010
* I never meant
 that much to you *

1291
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:51,014
* Can't believe you won't
 stay to see it through *

1292
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:54,384
* Can't you love me baby

1293
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:55,452
* It's hard today

1294
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,487
* Why didn't you let me know,

1295
01:10:57,521 --> 01:11:01,190
* Why didn't you let me know

1296
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:05,729
- Hey what up Spoons.

1297
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,864
- What up man, what the
 fuck you doing up in there?

1298
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,333
- Was talking with a friend
 of mine from high school.

1299
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:12,502
Ex-criminal, now he's
 the pastor of this place.

1300
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:14,538
Guess he was just giving
me some of his truths.

1301
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:15,972
- Look man you bring
 your arse to the crib

1302
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,942
around 8:30, I'll hook
 you up on some truths.

1303
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,677
- Not those kind
 of truths Spoony.

1304
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,112
- Man I hope you
 aint letting Valerie

1305
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,348
make you lose your
 mind are you man?

1306
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:27,584
- Oh Spoony you
 wouldn't understand.

1307
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,986
- Oh man don't even try
 to fade me like that man,

1308
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,389
see that's the problem
you niggers start going

1309
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,691
to college and church
 and all them places

1310
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,326
and you come out
 thinking you're all that,

1311
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,561
but you aint.

1312
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:40,063
- Yeah you know I don't
think I'm all that.

1313
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,531
I aint better then anybody else,

1314
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:43,667
I just went in there to check
 out the service all right.

1315
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,369
- Look man I just hope
 there's no fucking

1316
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:49,005
with our friendship 'cause I
 aint gee for that church shit.

1317
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,474
- Spoony don't talk like
you don't have the sense

1318
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:51,975
you were born with all right.

1319
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:55,244
- I bet you got the Holy
Ghost though didn't yah,

1320
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:56,780
I bet you you did.

1321
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,282
- Yeah, I got your Holy Ghost.

1322
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:26,976
- [Brandon] Hello.

1323
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:27,911
- Brandon it's Valerie.

1324
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,078
- [Brandon] Hey, how you doing?

1325
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,280
- Fine, I was um,
wondering if you'd like

1326
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:32,949
to go to breakfast this morning?

1327
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:34,418
- [Brandon] Oh I'd love
too but I gotta run,

1328
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,085
I have a breakfast meeting
 this morning at work.

1329
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,321
But can we get
 together after work?

1330
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,789
- Oh sure.

1331
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:41,791
- [Brandon] All right, um,
 pick you up at the same time.

1332
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,226
- Okay I'll see you then.

1333
01:12:43,259 --> 01:12:44,227
- [Brandon] Bye.

1334
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,094
- Bye.

1335
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,866
- Marty it sounds like
a real attractive offer

1336
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,402
but I'm not ready to
 make a move just yet.

1337
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:53,970
(knocking on door)

1338
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,072
Oh hold on one second.

1339
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,073
- Cheryl, how you
doing, you got a minute?

1340
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,642
- Sure, sure, come on in.

1341
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,076
Listen Marty I'll have to
 call you right back okay.

1342
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,711
Bye bye.

1343
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,146
So what's on your mind?

1344
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,248
- Uh listen I was wondering
 if there was anything

1345
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,852
I could do to um, save my job?

1346
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:12,221
- Oh really, so why
 the sudden change?

1347
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,458
- Well I guess I
figured that er,

1348
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,391
if I didn't do something
with my life soon

1349
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:16,593
I wouldn't amount to much.

1350
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:19,062
- Wow, I'm glad to hear
that you're finally

1351
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,096
thinking that way.

1352
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:23,500
So what happened, did
 your girlfriend come back?

1353
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:27,370
- No, I er, I just
 want to make a change.

1354
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:32,676
- Wow, I'll tell you what
 if you're really sincere

1355
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:35,579
about making an improvement
 I'll have something

1356
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:39,816
to take back to Jack, and you
 know that I have Jacks ear.

1357
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,585
- Yeah, yeah.

1358
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,620
- So, do we have a deal?

1359
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,423
- Sounds like a deal to me.

1360
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:50,960
- [Cheryl] Okay (laughs).

1361
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:52,996
- Thanks.

1362
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,839
- It was really nice of
 you to make dinner for me.

1363
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,974
- Oh it was my pleasure, can
 I get you something else.

1364
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:07,010
Perrier water, I
bought it just for you.

1365
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,080
(laughs)

1366
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:15,251
- Um, I have to
 tell you something,

1367
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:21,658
I hate Perrier water,
 I um, I told you that

1368
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,127
when I met you because I
didn't know what to say,

1369
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,730
and it seemed like the
right thing at the time.

1370
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:28,264
I was really nervous.

1371
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,166
- Oh come on, it
 didn't matter to me.

1372
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,772
- Why don't you tell
 me about your family?

1373
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,306
I haven't met your parents yet.

1374
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:45,014
- Man let me tell you I
thought I knew all about women,

1375
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:47,751
turns out man I'm just
 beginning to learn.

1376
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,285
- That's 'cause you have
to learn to make love

1377
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,321
to a womans mind man, anybody
 can have sex with them.

1378
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:54,023
- Yeah, yeah, now I
 know what happened

1379
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:55,491
between you and your woman.

1380
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:57,493
Her mind was feeling
 good but her body

1381
01:14:57,527 --> 01:14:59,062
wasn't feeling like nothing man.

1382
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,463
- No, no, don't get
 me wrong now brother,

1383
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,899
I know how to physically
satisfy a woman too,

1384
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,201
I'm just saying she
 needs more then that.

1385
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,737
- Spoony I bet you do what
 I used to do all the time

1386
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:11,040
just bust your nut, roll right
 over and go to sleep right.

1387
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:13,042
- You know that shit dog, she
 better get it while it lasts

1388
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:15,779
'cause it's going fast.

1389
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,280
- Yeah but doesn't that
make you stop and think

1390
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:19,816
why you can't hold onto a woman?

1391
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,284
I mean they gotta be tired
 of being treated like

1392
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:23,953
sex objects.

1393
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:25,421
- You know you really
 shouldn't be so hard

1394
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,391
on black men, you just
 haven't found a good one.

1395
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:31,828
- I'm not hard on them, I
 just know they aint no good.

1396
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,463
They just out to use you
for what they can get.

1397
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,233
- What are you complaining
 about, you get paid for it.

1398
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,335
(laughs)

1399
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:41,905
- Oh here we go.

1400
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:45,775
- I mean look at me
 I've got a good man.

1401
01:15:45,809 --> 01:15:46,943
- A good man?

1402
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:49,012
- Yeah.
 - He works at the gas station.

1403
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,480
He's the reason our
 average income is so low.

1404
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,918
- All right he doesn't
 make a lot of money

1405
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,386
but he treats me right.

1406
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,222
Now I don't sit around
 bitter about men,

1407
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:03,192
or jump at their every whim
 because they bought me.

1408
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:06,195
- You know things always
 seem to work themselves out

1409
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:09,833
for a reason 'cause the men I
 know they wouldn't want you.

1410
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:14,570
- Back to that again,
 Sharon what's wrong?

1411
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:15,805
I thought you and
 Alex were going out?

1412
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:19,275
- Oh Alex is not like
 a real boyfriend.

1413
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:22,712
Shoot he just comes
 around sometimes.

1414
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:26,015
I don't know, they
either conceited, broke,

1415
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:29,152
or uneducated, I think
 they all messed up.

1416
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:31,187
- You shouldn't think that
 way 'cause if we don't believe

1417
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,989
in them for sure
 no one else will.

1418
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:33,857
- There you go.

1419
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,126
- Look at him over there.

1420
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:40,563
I bet you he's a drug dealer.

1421
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,231
- Nope, I'm an accountant.

1422
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:53,576
- And look at him, I bet you
 he's running from the police.

1423
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,911
- Nope, I'm late for work.

1424
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:03,452
- Ooh, my God, now see
that is my kind of man.

1425
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,490
I bet you he's an engineer.

1426
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:10,927
- Hello ladies.

1427
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,561
- Hi.
- Hello.

1428
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:13,596
- Hey how you doing?

1429
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,463
- Okay.

1430
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,568
(laughs)

1431
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,436
- Hey!

1432
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,209
- Am I learning something
 here or what right?

1433
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:30,513
No, no a woman not only
want physical love,

1434
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:33,917
she needs that mental
 love, that spiritual love

1435
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,419
and the emotional love too.

1436
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,955
- See that's something that
 you brothers aren't doing.

1437
01:17:40,123 --> 01:17:43,226
- You know I think
 I've figured out why

1438
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:46,830
some women just might
 fall for a clown like BJ.

1439
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:51,034
I mean his whole game
 is crying, begging,

1440
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:54,170
playing up to them, he's just
 like that pathetic singer,

1441
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:57,173
what's his name, er,
 Ray Parker Junior,

1442
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,709
he used to try to
 put in his music.

1443
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:03,612
* A woman needs love
 just like you do *

1444
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:06,415
Scratch all of that, you
don't have to be whining

1445
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:09,218
like some puppy dog,
 old girl gets hurt

1446
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:12,021
you just take her downtown
 and you buy her something.

1447
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:14,791
Next thing you know
 she's feeling all better.

1448
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:17,526
Now preferably you wanna
 get her some nice lingerie

1449
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,296
so she can make you
 feel better later on.

1450
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:21,965
(laughs)

1451
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,632
- Now see that's
 what you have to do.

1452
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,936
See when I make love to a
 woman I hold her in my arms

1453
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,704
and I let her know
 that she's mine,

1454
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,974
and that together
 we're strong right.

1455
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,176
I use foreplay to stimulate her,

1456
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,511
plus I'm sensitive to her needs.

1457
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,580
- Oh man, man, man, tell you man

1458
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:39,849
by the time you get started
 with all that nonsense

1459
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:43,386
I'm through, Jimmy's wet
 and I'm catching some Z's

1460
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,154
up in the corner, man,
 get out of here with this.

1461
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:47,723
- That's why we all need to
 follow up behind you Spoony

1462
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,059
and make sure we
 satisfy your women

1463
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:52,395
because we know you
 won't be satisfying them.

1464
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,264
- Come on Spoony man
we need you to be a man

1465
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:57,333
for our women, don't you
 know that's one of the main

1466
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:59,735
reasons that women
leave men 'cause you all

1467
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:01,604
are all insensitive
and all you think about

1468
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:03,006
is yourself?

1469
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:04,540
- Tell you the truth guys,

1470
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:09,245
I can't even relate to the
 stuff y'all talking about.

1471
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,784
As a matter of fact, most
 women they get all hot

1472
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:16,619
just looking at me.

1473
01:19:16,652 --> 01:19:19,755
- Man, man, Alex come on
 back down to Earth with us,

1474
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:22,058
join us here on reality
street with that shit.

1475
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,593
- No man straight up,
 listen, just the other day

1476
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:28,231
I had this divine
creature in bed with me

1477
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,399
and you know she had
 the nerve to bet me

1478
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:35,438
that in three tries I
 couldn't knock her arse out.

1479
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,473
- So you fucked her three times

1480
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:38,607
and busted her
 head with a brick.

1481
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:40,910
(laughing)

1482
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,749
- Y'all pathetic man, listen
 I'm out of here later.

1483
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,118
- All right homey take care.

1484
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:06,635
- What are you watching?

1485
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,504
- This show it's
 crazy, I've never seen

1486
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,839
anything like this before.

1487
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,210
- What's so funny about it?

1488
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:15,879
- Val you gotta check it
 out, there's these black guys

1489
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:17,580
they're all walking
around town going yeah,

1490
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,516
where's my hoe, tag up dog yeah.

1491
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,019
I've never seen anything
like this before.

1492
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:24,720
- And you think
 that shits funny?

1493
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:26,789
It's exploitive.

1494
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:32,661
- Yeah so what I'm
 saying is I'm trying

1495
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:34,163
to get my shit back --

1496
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:35,531
- Man Thomas as soon as
 I brought in the crib man

1497
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,765
she was just like --
 - Trying to do better at work.

1498
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:38,001
- Over me man.

1499
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,302
- I'm thinking about
 going back to school.

1500
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,603
- She just whipped her
bra off and her titties

1501
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,138
just blam, fell out
 all over the place.

1502
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,206
- Why do we always have to
 talk about women like this?

1503
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,707
- Nipples this big.

1504
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,376
- Spoony, spoony you don't even
hear a damn word I'm saying.

1505
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,278
- And it was just
waiting on me, waiting--

1506
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:50,513
- You're momma.

1507
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:51,647
- Just calling me, said
Spoony come get it,

1508
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,182
Spoony come get it--

1509
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:54,650
- With a big fat
 skanky ass Spoony.

1510
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,619
- And she was just woo
 man, and finally I was just

1511
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:57,887
getting ready to grab her ass--

1512
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:59,322
- Spoony what is
 that on your lip,

1513
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,190
a big old fat herpes sore?

1514
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:20,343
- Thomas I'd like to see you
 in my office for a moment.

1515
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:26,950
- Me?

1516
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:28,517
- Yes you, your name
 is Thomas isn't it?

1517
01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:35,824
- So, why do you think I've
 called you into my office?

1518
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,427
- I'm fired?

1519
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,930
- No just the opposite,
you've been doing

1520
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:43,666
remarkably well, and I
just wanted to tell you

1521
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,534
to keep up the good work.

1522
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,736
- Yeah well, I'm working,
 you know, I've been,

1523
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,505
I've been trying, I've really
 been trying you know that.

1524
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:54,043
- Yes I know and Jack
 has taken notice.

1525
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:56,112
As a matter of fact
 he wants me to start

1526
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:58,081
working with you a
 little more closely.

1527
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,984
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1528
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:02,285
- That's great.

1529
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:05,221
- Congratulations.

1530
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,624
- Yeah thanks, I've
 really been trying.

1531
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:09,758
Thanks.

1532
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,626
- Well carry on.

1533
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:24,340
- So this place you're taking
 me has great barbecue huh?

1534
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:26,275
- You have to go to the
south side for barbecue,

1535
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:28,044
it's the best.

1536
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:32,781
- I hate this.
 - What?

1537
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:34,984
- Did you see them back there?

1538
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:35,918
The way they're
 all standing around

1539
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,786
wasting taxpayers dollars.

1540
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,622
- They're homeless, where
 are they supposed to go?

1541
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,090
- School, they can get a job.

1542
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,593
- These people are
 trying to find shelter

1543
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:45,995
and they're supposed to
be able to go to school

1544
01:22:46,029 --> 01:22:47,530
and do homework
 at the same time?

1545
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,332
- Oh come on don't you
think that's a cop out?

1546
01:22:49,365 --> 01:22:50,566
- No I don't.

1547
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,735
Brandon you know who
 your parents were,

1548
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:55,971
you had a role model, these
 people have had to rely

1549
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:58,107
on themselves all their lives.

1550
01:22:58,141 --> 01:22:59,508
- So what are you saying?

1551
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,810
- I'm saying too often
 we want to take credit

1552
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,347
for how we end up in
 life, but say for instance

1553
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,681
you had to relive
 your life through

1554
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:08,484
one of these peoples
experiences, do you really think

1555
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:09,852
that you'd still be a trader?

1556
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:11,287
- Of course, Valerie
 that's the great thing

1557
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,922
about living in America,
 rich or poor, black or white,

1558
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:16,525
Chinese, whatever,
 we all have a chance.

1559
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:17,893
I mean what do you think
Federal Aid is for?

1560
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,362
That's why I get so
 aggravated every time

1561
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:20,829
it's being wasted on someone.

1562
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:23,499
- Well you just
 don't get it do you?

1563
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,270
That's what it's supposed
 to be like but it's not.

1564
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:37,146
- So as a result I
 took him to court,

1565
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,615
and they awarded me alimony.

1566
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,484
- That's what he gets.

1567
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,418
- God damn.

1568
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,121
- What did you say?

1569
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,622
- I said God damn.

1570
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,457
- Look I'd advise you
 to look straight ahead

1571
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:50,226
and mind your own business.

1572
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:52,095
- But you're just
 sitting there bragging

1573
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:55,764
about that alimony shit
man, pathetic bitch.

1574
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:57,800
- You don't even know
him, I'm sure if you did

1575
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,936
you would understand that
 she deserves every penny.

1576
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,305
- That's fucked up.

1577
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,640
- Really, well let's
see what your supervisor

1578
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:06,041
thinks about this.

1579
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:06,975
- I mean that's like
 paying for a car

1580
01:24:07,009 --> 01:24:08,844
you can't even drive man.

1581
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,846
- Just wait I'm sure one
day you will be paying

1582
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,248
someone alimony.

1583
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,984
- Fuck that, if I
 send a bitch a check

1584
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:18,154
she's gonna send me
some pussy in the mail.

1585
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:23,426
- Brothers and sisters,
I've been noticing

1586
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:26,695
a lot of talk going
 on about our sisters,

1587
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,365
wearing the contact
 lenses right.

1588
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,100
I just wanted to
 shed a little light

1589
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:33,969
on what I think part
 of the problem is,

1590
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,472
I call them sassy Susies.

1591
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:40,075
She's hanging out
 by the pool room,

1592
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:42,345
over on East Ferry Street.

1593
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:44,380
Seems like a likely place to be,

1594
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,782
when you're out
 to sell your meat,

1595
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:50,119
packaging is so important.

1596
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:54,590
Mini skirts and punk high
heels, she knows your fantasies

1597
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:58,527
by number, the price you
pay to make them real.

1598
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,197
Old Sassy Susie
 she aint a floosy

1599
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:02,698
if you know what I mean.

1600
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:05,434
Old Sassy Susie she
 aint too choosy,

1601
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:07,636
you've got to have the grain.

1602
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,838
A blonde girl died
 and left her hair

1603
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:13,176
so that Susie could
 have more fun,

1604
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:16,044
her neon sign for
 a good, good time,

1605
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:17,780
she knows that she's the one.

1606
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:22,451
Her brown eyes turn
 blue, in an instant

1607
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:25,020
anything to please her man.

1608
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:27,923
You see she gave up
 on herself long ago,

1609
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,558
why can't you understand.

1610
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,263
It's not a matter of pleasure
 when Susie is doing that,

1611
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:38,734
the pleasure's all yours,
 it keeps you coming back.

1612
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:40,869
So why you picking on Susie,

1613
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:44,673
when you ought to smack
Jack, life's a bitch

1614
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:47,710
and Susie's a fact.

1615
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:50,112
- That's right,
 don't be blaming us,

1616
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,915
we're only doing what
 y'all want us to do.

1617
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,116
- That's right sister.

1618
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,320
(gun firing)

1619
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,855
(dramatic music)

1620
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,658
(tires squealing)

1621
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,798
- Oh shit, oh God BJ.

1622
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:15,538
BJ, don't go out the game,
 don't go out the game.

1623
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:17,072
What about the black man
 man, don't go out the game.

1624
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,207
Just please, don't go.

1625
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:24,480
(screaming)
 (crying)

1626
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:32,955
* Treat me right,
 treat me right *

1627
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:36,725
* Stop killing one another

1628
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:44,032
- [Reporter] In memory of
 community leader BJ Brown

1629
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:46,602
slain by a senseless driveby,
 this song is for him.

1630
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:52,375
(knocking on door)

1631
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:54,377
- Come in.

1632
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,714
- Mr Jackson, I
 received your memo.

1633
01:26:58,747 --> 01:26:59,582
- Great.

1634
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,217
- I'm honored that you
 think I could handle

1635
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:03,919
such a position one day.

1636
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:06,789
- Hey you deserve it,
 you know I can see you

1637
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:08,824
being VP of this
company one day.

1638
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:11,660
- Well is there anything I
 should be concentrating on?

1639
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,929
- Well to be honest
with you I thought maybe

1640
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,666
we could go out to
 dinner, see a show.

1641
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,736
- Strictly business?

1642
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:26,709
- Look baby I'm rich, I
can help you get ahead,

1643
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:29,878
I just thought we
 could give it a try.

1644
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,147
It would be most
 beneficial to you.

1645
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,151
- Mr Jackson, I do
believe you're stepping

1646
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:38,654
well beyond the bounds
of professionalism here

1647
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:42,057
and I really thought that
 you knew me better then that.

1648
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,760
- All I know is this
 is something I want,

1649
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:47,996
so if I were you I would
put it in my plans.

1650
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:55,438
- Um, Mr Jackson, no
 disrespect intended,

1651
01:27:58,173 --> 01:27:59,708
but I'm not interested.

1652
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:02,445
- I'm one of the most
 powerful men around,

1653
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:04,647
how in the hell could
 you not want me?

1654
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:09,718
I'll tell you
 what, you're fired,

1655
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:11,620
till you can see things my way.

1656
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:12,588
- But Jack.

1657
01:28:13,756 --> 01:28:16,792
- I'm not joking,
 get out of here,

1658
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,528
and don't come back
 until you're ready.

1659
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:24,467
Oh by the way, you can tell
 whoever you want about this,

1660
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:28,604
I'll take care of that
 too, goodbye Michelle.

1661
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:34,710
- I don't believe you,
 what are you looking for?

1662
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:38,313
- Look Brandon is fine,
you know he's fine.

1663
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:39,548
(laughs)

1664
01:28:39,582 --> 01:28:41,450
It's just we have
different sensitivities.

1665
01:28:41,484 --> 01:28:43,352
- I don't think you've
given it a fair chance.

1666
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:45,354
- Yeah, if we had children
 what kind of values

1667
01:28:45,388 --> 01:28:46,755
would we teach our children?

1668
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,791
- Yours, yours and his.

1669
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,760
- No matter how much he loved
 me, he could only speculate

1670
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:53,829
on my existence as
 an African American.

1671
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:56,098
- You are so confused,
 you find a man

1672
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,300
10 times better then Thomas
 and you start talking

1673
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,635
this shit.

1674
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,903
- Oh now I wouldn't necessarily
say that he's better

1675
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:03,038
then Thomas, but I will
say that he has had

1676
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,541
all the advantages that
 this country has to offer.

1677
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,420
- I don't know
 what you're hiding,

1678
01:29:17,453 --> 01:29:18,654
aint nothing back there.

1679
01:29:32,668 --> 01:29:34,102
- You know BJ may have
 been a lot of things

1680
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:37,740
to a lot of people man,
 but to me he's my family D.

1681
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:43,912
See Thomas man I aint
 never had no family before,

1682
01:29:43,946 --> 01:29:45,347
least none that cared man.

1683
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,651
BJ really cared you know.

1684
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,590
Now that he's gone nobody
 cares, just like it was.

1685
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:03,231
- You know Spoon we all
 miss BJ, he was a good man.

1686
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:10,072
But you still got family,
 I'm your family man.

1687
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:15,410
I mean I'm here and
 I care all right.

1688
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:18,781
Don't forget that bean head.

1689
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,084
- All right man.

1690
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,395
- Why we stopping?

1691
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:39,535
- Sharon I thought the way
 you carried on with Reggie

1692
01:30:39,568 --> 01:30:41,537
back there was a
 bit disrespectful.

1693
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:45,608
- Don't be jealous over
that, he's your friend.

1694
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:49,978
- 12 records in a row, I
 swear if I would have heard

1695
01:30:50,012 --> 01:30:52,581
Key Sweat Wine one more
time I would have taken

1696
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:54,349
this pocket book that
 you left me holding

1697
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,018
and threw it at that damn DJ.

1698
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:59,522
- Oh, he wouldn't stop.

1699
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:01,890
Anyway he's the star, I
wouldn't subject myself

1700
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:03,325
to that kind of life anyway.

1701
01:31:05,494 --> 01:31:09,732
- Um, I have to make a phone
 call I'll be right back,

1702
01:31:09,765 --> 01:31:11,166
I'm gonna use the
 pay phone over there.

1703
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,569
- What's wrong
 with the car phone?

1704
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:15,103
- There's nothing wrong
with the car phone baby

1705
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,372
it's just that well you know
 the guy that I'm gonna call

1706
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,475
he has one of those cheap
 cellular phones right

1707
01:31:20,509 --> 01:31:23,378
and I read somewhere that if
 you call from your car phone

1708
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,013
the static could
 mess up your phone

1709
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:26,882
and I don't wanna use this
 one so don't worry about it,

1710
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:28,651
just relax I'll be
 right back okay.

1711
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:56,712
Hello Alex, this is
 Luther Van Dross man.

1712
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:58,681
Listen I'm coming
 to town next week

1713
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:00,816
and I thought we
 might get together.

1714
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,052
Yeah man, have some dinner
 like old times you know.

1715
01:32:04,086 --> 01:32:05,688
So give me a call all right.

1716
01:32:05,721 --> 01:32:07,656
Talk to you.

1717
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:26,374
- I just tried to
 make a call myself

1718
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:27,475
and it wouldn't work.

1719
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:30,012
- Oh it's probably
 some technical thing

1720
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,479
you just don't understand.

1721
01:32:31,513 --> 01:32:35,483
- No, no, no, my uncle
has the exact same phone

1722
01:32:35,517 --> 01:32:37,653
and aren't they all the
 same, you dial the number

1723
01:32:37,686 --> 01:32:39,622
and then you push send.

1724
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,992
- I don't think so, this
 one happens to be handmade

1725
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:46,394
from Switzerland, it's
 a little different.

1726
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:58,974
(smooth romantic music)

1727
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,982
- Mm leopard skin.

1728
01:33:19,461 --> 01:33:22,798
(moaning with pleasure)

1729
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:44,920
- You know this little
 piggy right here,

1730
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:48,290
she went to Bloomingdales.

1731
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:55,698
While this little
 piggy, she was tired

1732
01:33:57,432 --> 01:33:59,367
so she stayed at the condo.

1733
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:00,703
- Okay.

1734
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:08,110
- And this little piggy,
she had belugar caviar

1735
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,079
and honey.

1736
01:34:15,183 --> 01:34:19,922
But this little piggy,
I'm sorry, she had none.

1737
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:24,927
- Oh.

1738
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,729
- But do you know what,
this little piggy,

1739
01:34:26,762 --> 01:34:31,767
well she cried, oh yeah.

1740
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,673
(moaning in pleasure)

1741
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:46,081
- Oh Alex oh.

1742
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:51,686
Alex, I'm not
 getting any younger,

1743
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,489
I'm looking for something
 a little bit more

1744
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,591
then just a fling in the sack.

1745
01:34:58,827 --> 01:35:01,063
- Come on that's not
 what we have here Sharon.

1746
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:05,934
I mean, where, where do
 women get this nonsense from

1747
01:35:05,968 --> 01:35:08,470
that every time
 they're approaching 30

1748
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:09,772
they have to get married.

1749
01:35:11,173 --> 01:35:14,076
- Alex, you know as well
 as anyone that when a woman

1750
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:17,045
gets older men don't find
 her attractive anymore,

1751
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:18,580
you know that.

1752
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:23,051
- That's, that's just
utterly hogwash Sharon.

1753
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:24,719
Listen, just keep
 yourself together,

1754
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:26,221
you'll always have a man.

1755
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:29,224
- Bet you can say that
now but I never see you

1756
01:35:29,257 --> 01:35:31,927
with any older women, hmm.

1757
01:35:34,296 --> 01:35:37,065
- That's because I have never
 seen one keep herself together

1758
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:40,235
now if you don't mind I'm
 gonna run to the bathroom

1759
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:43,138
and just hit that last
 button over there,

1760
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:44,840
the one on the phone there.
 - Okay.

1761
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,078
- [Miss Burger] Hello

01:35:57,019 --> 01:35:57,853

1766
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,955

1767
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:02,157

(door closing)

1775
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,050

- Oh that's her name, right.

1779
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:43,558
- Yeah, poor girl

1780
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:44,359
- Get the fuck out of here.

1781
01:37:44,392 --> 01:37:45,593
- No man, I kid you not,

01:37:45,627 --> 01:37:47,996

 get married Spoony.

1783
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,899
But me and you both know that
 shit's out of the question.

1784
01:37:50,933 --> 01:37:52,100
- Fuck it man.

1785

- Come on man whenever

- I've bang all their
 damn brains out.

1793
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,589
(laughs)

1794
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:17,059
- Wait a minute, I know

1795
01:38:32,107 --> 01:38:33,541
- 52nd and Woodlong please.

1796
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:34,409

Wait a minute, you look

01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,588
- I don't think you've

1800
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,259

- I don't know,

1806
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:03,938
- Well I don't think he knows.

1807
01:39:11,746 --> 01:39:14,416
(phone dialing)

1808
01:39:17,652 --> 01:39:18,620

1809
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,854

1815
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:33,335
- Come on man get

01:39:33,368 --> 01:39:35,403
a whole lot of practice.

1817
01:39:35,437 --> 01:39:37,805
- Oh man I aint got
 nothing but time black man.

1818
01:39:37,839 --> 01:39:40,742
Anyway, how you get a female
 like Sharon in bed man?

1819
01:39:42,744 --> 01:39:45,113
- Oh Sharon, well you
 know, it's easy to get

1820
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:47,215
a woman like Sharon in bed.

1821
01:39:47,249 --> 01:39:49,951
All you do is you
 wine her, dine her,

1822
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,886
make her feel important,
next thing you know

1823
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:53,388
she'd be all over you.

1824
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:56,291
I swear to you man she asked
 me to go to bed with her.

1825
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,959
- Man you's a bad
 motherfucker man.

1826
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:00,062
- Hey I'll tell you truth man,

1827
01:40:00,095 --> 01:40:03,231
I was fucking that
bitch, next thing I know

1828
01:40:03,265 --> 01:40:05,867
she started hollering
 and screaming and kicking

1829
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:09,304
on in here, I thought she
 was gonna fall out and faint.

1830
01:40:11,773 --> 01:40:13,007
- How many times you hit it G?

1831
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:14,942
- You know it's kind
 of hard to count man

1832
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,078
on the down stroke
 but I must have

1833
01:40:16,111 --> 01:40:17,612
fucked her about three times.

1834
01:40:17,645 --> 01:40:19,381
And she wouldn't
 leave me alone man.

1835
01:40:19,414 --> 01:40:21,383
I was tired, so I ended
up throwing her dumb ass

1836
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:23,318
on out of here.

1837
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:24,752
- Well you know something
 man, I admire you,

1838
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:26,454
I really think you're
 a punk motherfucker.

1839
01:40:26,488 --> 01:40:28,056
Want to know why?

1840
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:31,059
- What's this we're
 talking about?

1841
01:40:31,093 --> 01:40:35,197
- What is wrong with your
 phony, pretentious ass.

1842
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:36,664
- Wait a minute baby.

1843
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:39,601
- Pay your bills, or send
 your haul squirly arse

1844
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:40,935
lying on me like that.

1845
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:42,904
You know good and
 damn well I walked out

1846
01:40:42,937 --> 01:40:45,407
without giving you
 shit since I saw your

1847
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,576
phony one for every
occasion business cards

1848
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:51,113
and your $50 bank balance.

1849
01:40:51,146 --> 01:40:51,946
Broke bastard.

1850
01:40:57,519 --> 01:41:00,488
- That was some cold shit
 you put Alex through man.

1851
01:41:00,522 --> 01:41:02,457
I mean that was a cold stunt.

1852
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:04,492
- Look man when this
 female got in the cab

1853
01:41:04,526 --> 01:41:06,828
buses a line, I could tell
 he was lying and shit,

1854
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:08,596
I just had to bust him out too.

1855
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:12,600
- You know I just don't
understand why the man

1856
01:41:12,634 --> 01:41:15,203
got to put himself
 through that shit.

1857
01:41:15,237 --> 01:41:18,773
It's just a lot less
 confusing if you're at peace

1858
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,275
with yourself.

1859
01:41:20,308 --> 01:41:21,543
- I tell you it's about
 that escapism theory man.

1860
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:24,679
I tell you motherfuckers
always want to escape

1861
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:27,982
their blackness, always want
 to escape their self man.

1862
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,151
If I was that ugly
 motherfucker I'd want

1863
01:41:29,184 --> 01:41:30,452
to escape myself too.

1864
01:41:30,485 --> 01:41:32,554
(laughs)

1865
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,290
- You said Sharon
 was in your cab.

1866
01:41:35,323 --> 01:41:37,525
What was Sharon doing in a cab?

1867
01:41:37,559 --> 01:41:39,427
- Stowaway and driving,
 what the fuck do you think

1868
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:41,329
she was doing in the cab man .

1869
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:42,797
- That's cold, that's just cold.

1870
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:43,965
- Man she didn't
 even have no money

1871
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:44,799
to pay for the
 motherfucking fare,

1872
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,201
she owe me now.

1873
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:48,536
She know how I want to
be paid back don't she.

1874
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,371
- Yeehaw.

1875
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:53,040
Some strange shit be
 happening if you open the cab.

1876
01:41:53,074 --> 01:41:56,077
- You don't know
 the half of it man.

1877
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,213
Just the other day I was
downtown waiting on a fare right

1878
01:41:58,246 --> 01:41:59,514
and this motherfucker
 walked past the cab

1879
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:01,849
and handed me a note,
 you know what it said,

1880
01:42:01,883 --> 01:42:04,051
I'll give you $50 if you
 let me suck your dick right.

1881
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:06,888
I'm telling you man
 I popped out the cab

1882
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:08,856
to see what his
 motherfucking problem was man

1883
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,226
and I would have
 whopped his arse,

1884
01:42:11,259 --> 01:42:12,960
if I didn't need
 the money so bad.

1885
01:42:14,095 --> 01:42:15,863
- Oh man you a
 sick, you're sick.

1886
01:42:17,332 --> 01:42:19,234
- Check it out, check it out,
 check out your boy over there.

1887
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:21,035
Big Al, what up homey.

1888
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:23,838
(laughs)

1889
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,340
- Don't be so cruel man.

1890
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:28,075
- Fuck that front man,

1891
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:30,912

1893
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:37,919
- Hey, wonder where he works?

1894
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:41,556
- I got the cab
 round the corner.

1895
01:42:47,962 --> 01:42:50,265
(laughs)

1896
01:42:50,298 --> 01:42:53,268
Mr black mans wish,

1897
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:55,270

Hey man maybe we should
go inside you know,

1899
01:42:57,339 --> 01:42:58,773

 embarrassing for him.

1900
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:00,074
- Man it's for his own good.

1901
01:43:00,107 --> 01:43:01,476
- Can I help yah?

1902
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:02,610
- Yes, is Alex in?

1903
01:43:03,545 --> 01:43:04,612
- Yeah sure I'll

1904
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:05,480
- Thank you.

1905
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,224
- Can you believe this man,
 look at this, look at this.

1906
01:43:16,258 --> 01:43:17,459
Look at this car here, all
 the bullet holes in it.

1907
01:43:17,492 --> 01:43:20,127
It look like Al
 Capone's car man.

1908
01:43:20,161 --> 01:43:22,196
- Oh man, I can't wait
for this lying ass thing

1909
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,298
to get his butt out here.

1910
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:24,766
- You go get his ass boy.

1911
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:31,172
(laughing)

1912
01:43:35,443 --> 01:43:39,647
- Man you is a messed up
 brother with your rich ass.

1913
01:43:39,681 --> 01:43:42,083
- Let me guess, you
 own the place right.

1914
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,456
- Busted.
- Like a cherry.

1915
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:52,727
- Alex lovely suit, lovely,
 what'd you do rent it?

1916
01:43:54,496 --> 01:43:59,267
- Yeah let's get out of here,
 this brother kills me man.

1917
01:44:05,373 --> 01:44:06,541
- So I'm out of here.

1918
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,176
- If Thomas takes you
 back I'm going to get

1919
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:10,512
his head examined for him.

1920
01:44:11,979 --> 01:44:14,048
- Mother it's not
 like that at all.

1921
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,983
Thomas has a lot
 of good qualities,

1922
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:18,019
I just didn't see it at first.

1923
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:20,955
I'm really gonna do
 my best this time.

1924
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:26,027
- If you're serious and
 not running back to Thomas

1925
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,662
because you and
Brandon didn't work out

1926
01:44:27,695 --> 01:44:30,898
then I'm proud of you.

1927
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:33,501
- I'm really gonna do my
best this time mother,

1928
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:35,603
wish me luck.

1929
01:44:36,738 --> 01:44:37,572
- Good luck.

1930
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:39,774
- Bye bye.

1931
01:44:41,309 --> 01:44:44,312
(smooth jazz music)

1932
01:44:54,356 --> 01:44:57,291
(doorbell ringing)

1933
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,534
- Val, what's up?

1934
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,838
- You look really great.

1935
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:15,410
- So do you, thanks, what
 brings you around the way?

1936
01:45:16,578 --> 01:45:18,913
- I just want to talk to you.

1937
01:45:18,946 --> 01:45:20,147
- Is something wrong?

1938
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:23,618
- No nothing's wrong,
 I was just thinking

1939
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:27,121
about you the other day and
 well I've had a lot of time

1940
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,856
to think and I just
 wanted to apologize

1941
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:31,493
for not being as supportive
 as I could have been.

1942
01:45:31,526 --> 01:45:33,327
- Hey come on, don't
 worry about it,

1943
01:45:34,796 --> 01:45:37,031
we both could have done a
 lot of things differently.

1944
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:42,069
- I was wondering if maybe
 you'd like to go to dinner

1945
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:44,672
tonight, no Curry's or anything.

1946
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:49,276
- Well uh, I'm sort of
 seeing somebody you know.

1947
01:45:51,379 --> 01:45:53,748
- Thomas, are you ready to go.

1948
01:45:54,749 --> 01:45:58,152
* How do you like me now

1949
01:46:09,397 --> 01:46:13,735
* Check it out I got a little
 story, it goes like this *

1950
01:46:13,768 --> 01:46:15,870
* A hard working
brother making peanuts *

1951
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:18,139
* Got enough money but not
 enough to do what I want *

1952
01:46:18,172 --> 01:46:19,474
* When I want so I'm
 in a one bedroom *

1953
01:46:19,507 --> 01:46:21,809
* With no head room,
 no lights, no heat *

1954
01:46:21,843 --> 01:46:23,344
* In other words
 I'm kinda cheap *

1955
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,079
* Can't afford to
 take my lady out *

1956
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:27,181
* Pockets broke, I
 gotta borrow money *

1957
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:28,650
* I don't go to work

1958
01:46:28,683 --> 01:46:30,184
* My lady got a job downtown
 with a whole bunch *

1959
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:32,086
* Of snobs telling her
 girl you do not need him *

1960
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:33,888
* 'Cause I don't
 make a lot of money *

1961
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:35,156
* But it's funny
when I do work *

1962
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,658
* My boss wanna play
 me like a jerk *

1963
01:46:36,691 --> 01:46:38,159
* To top it off my womans
 getting decked out *

1964
01:46:38,192 --> 01:46:39,661
* Kicking it to
 parties without me *

1965
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:41,529
* I'm hoping she aint
 giving the sex out *

1966
01:46:41,563 --> 01:46:43,598
* And now I'm living vexed out

1967
01:46:43,631 --> 01:46:44,732
* She came home I put her out

1968
01:46:44,766 --> 01:46:46,033
* And now her
 stereotype is white *

1969
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,702
* Or should I say she's
kicking it with anyone *

1970
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:50,237
* Without color, making a
 lot more then a brother *

1971
01:46:50,271 --> 01:46:53,340
* Finally I realized I was
 hurt and can't live life *

1972
01:46:53,374 --> 01:46:55,342
* Trying to sleep 'cause
a brother aint working *

1973
01:46:55,376 --> 01:46:57,645
* And yeah I feel depressed,
 nobody listening *

1974
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,180
* And I'm wishing I can
get this off my chest *

1975
01:46:59,213 --> 01:47:01,415
* But I can't, meanwhile
 I'm trying to stay high *

1976
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:03,618
* But for my ass mess
 around and get fired *

1977
01:47:03,651 --> 01:47:05,887
* So to make myself
 exempt from that *

1978
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,456
* I thought of breaking my
 back doing work for jack *

1979
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,091
* Didn't like it
 when I got paid *

1980
01:47:10,124 --> 01:47:12,994
* Now I got a dope woman and
 my whole damn crib is late *

1981
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:15,162
* My ex-girlfriend
 came by to see how *

1982
01:47:15,196 --> 01:47:16,864
* I was living I told her foul

1983
01:47:16,898 --> 01:47:18,966
* Hey I know you like it

1984
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,102
* How you like it

1985
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:24,105
* How you like it

1986
01:47:24,138 --> 01:47:26,774
* Can you get with it

1987
01:47:26,808 --> 01:47:29,310
* I know you like it

1988
01:47:29,343 --> 01:47:30,277
* How you like it

1989
01:47:30,311 --> 01:47:31,946
* How you like it

1990
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:36,050
* How you like it

1991
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,652
* Now I see exactly what
was wrong with myself *

1992
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:39,821
* I had to get my life and
 pull it off the shelf *

1993
01:47:39,854 --> 01:47:41,589
* Too many obstacles,
 too much trust *

1994
01:47:41,623 --> 01:47:43,357
* But I guess nobody
 took me serious *

1995
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:44,626
* Enough to put me to the test

1996
01:47:44,659 --> 01:47:46,528
* But now I look back
 and think oh man *

1997
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:48,195
* I'm glad I didn't let
the economic world *

1998
01:47:48,229 --> 01:47:49,664
* Kill another black man

1999
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:51,398
* 'Cause I was going down
 like a lot of other *

2000
01:47:51,432 --> 01:47:53,167
* Fake frought and knuckle
 time ass brothers *

2001
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,837
* Didn't have to sell
drugs to make a living *

2002
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:57,672
* Didn't have to smell
looking like I'm happy *

2003
01:47:57,705 --> 01:47:59,974
* If I'm eating chicken,
I made it work out *

2004
01:48:00,007 --> 01:48:01,643
* For myself, how you like it

2005
01:48:01,676 --> 01:48:03,110
* Can you get with it

2006
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:05,713
* Yeah, I know you like it

2007
01:48:05,747 --> 01:48:09,150
* How you like it

2008
01:48:09,183 --> 01:48:14,088
* Yo I got a question

2009
01:48:14,121 --> 01:48:15,422
* Can you get with it

2010
01:48:15,456 --> 01:48:17,792
* I know you like it
 * How you like it *

2011
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,460
* How you like it

2012
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:22,630
* As we continue now when
 I be too I see a lot *

2013
01:48:22,664 --> 01:48:24,231
* Of brothers making no
 progress and making no money *

2014
01:48:24,265 --> 01:48:26,668
* But I think I left a job
 that can't hold it's own *

2015
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:29,236
* And God bless the grown
 mess stuffing on the bone *

2016
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:30,972
* 'Cause every time
 you see a black man *

2017
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,840
* He's sort of stopping
 and if he's living large *

2018
01:48:32,874 --> 01:48:34,475
* He's a dope man, or
 he's a steady Marvin *

2019
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:35,910
* Now look at my neighborhood

2020
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:37,111
* Today they play the fool,

2021
01:48:37,144 --> 01:48:38,646
* A lot of people never
went to college, *

2022
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,947
* Some never stay in school

2023
01:48:39,981 --> 01:48:41,248
* Because there
 was no initiative *

2024
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:42,483
* The guy don't want the
place to be friendly *

2025
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:43,818
* 'Cause aint nobody sensitive

2026
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,119
* Sooner or later
 you will find out *

2027
01:48:45,152 --> 01:48:47,054
* Without the education
or a job you a slob *

2028
01:48:47,088 --> 01:48:50,257
* So get yourself together
 quit pushing on the clock *

2029
01:48:50,291 --> 01:48:54,361
* So I can look
 you in your face *
