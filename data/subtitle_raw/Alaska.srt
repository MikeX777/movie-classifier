(lively music)
(people chattering)

00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,429
(mellow music)

00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,892
# It doesn't seem so long ago

5
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:47,977
# We laughed and joked with dear old Joe

6
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:50,821
# Then Joe departed from this Earth

7
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:54,989
# But he's around to share our mirth

8
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:59,999
# Some vandal committed desecration

9
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:05,440
# And now we ask in desperate desperation

10
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,335
# Oh, we'd

11
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:15,376
# Like to find the guy who took his ashes

12
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:19,001
# In the urn that stood
in front his bungalow

13
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:22,669
# For the urn in which the
scoundrel flicked his ashes

14
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,521
# Held the ashes of our dear, departed Joe

15
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,281
# Oh, we'd like to trace
the fiend who cigaretted

16
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,033
# Nonchalantly flicking ashes for a joke

17
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,685
# Well, if that's a joke,
believe us, we don't get it

18
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:41,541
# And we know it wasn't
Joe, he didn't smoke

19
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:45,767
# It was I who accidentally
spilled the ashes on that day

20
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,739
# And the wind blew none too gently

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,836
# Scattering most of them away

22
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,557
# And believe me I've been busy
makin' up for what I spilled

23
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:57,497
# I've been smokin' till
I'm dizzy, but it's filled

24
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:59,998
# It's filled

25
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:06,534
# Oh, it's not so much
because you pulled a boner

26
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,239
# That is making us
displeased, we'll have you know

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,585
# It is just we'll never know an El Corona

28
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:19,753
# From the ashes of our dear, departed Joe

00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:24,181

# Old

31

# Joe

(audience applauding)

33
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,442
Well, what are you looking at?

34
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,972
I'm not trying to learn
the combination, sir.

35
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,264
Oh, no?

36
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:58,430
What were you looking at then?

37
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:59,668
Nothing, sir.

38
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,651
I was just dreaming of my
home in merry old England.

39
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:04,541
Well, do your merry old dreaming

40
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,857
on your own time, will you?

41
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,034
I think I've proven that
you can trust me, sir.

42
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:11,731
I don't trust anyone.

43
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:13,896
I wanna understand, sir.

44
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:16,029
You're a pretty smart fellow, Stumpy.

45
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,483
Thank you, sir.

46
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:19,001
But don't get too smart.

47
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,169
Oh, no, sir.

48
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:29,915
(crowd chattering)
(lively music)

49
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,820
[Man] Hey there, Ike.

50
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,823
Lend me 50, will ya, Steve?

51
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,301
Hey, you're a freaking freighter.

52
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,679
That's why you got it and I ain't.

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,176
Now you'll get rich a
lot sooner haulin' it

54
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,535
than I will diggin' it.

55
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:55,536
All right.

56
00:04:56,832 --> 00:05:00,332
(lively orchestral music)

57
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:22,901
(audience applauding)

58
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,233
[Man] A dollar for a drink of whiskey,

59
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,789
it's robbery, that's what it is.

60
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,667
[Man] You steal it from the
ground, we steal it from you.

61
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:28,705
What's the difference?

62
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:29,539
[Man] He is right, I took out

63
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,014
close to 5,000 post gold Wednesday.

64
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,042
And they found Charlie in the goats

65
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,035
with a bullet in his head.

66
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:35,559
United States Marshal's all right.

67
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,165
But he ain't bulletproof.

68
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,004
Hello, Bill.

69
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,688
Gary, Gary Corbett.

70
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,968
- Say, don't you ever change?
- Oh-ho-ho, Gary.

71
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,224
Boys, I want you to
meet Pop Corbett's son.

72
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,646
This is Steve Jones.

73
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:49,652
- Howdy, Corbett.
- Howdy.

74
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,534
- And this is...
- Bailey, Joe Bailey.

75
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,493
Glad to meet you, Bailey.

76
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:54,222
What are you doing in Moose River?

77
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,056
I thought you were in the States,

78
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:56,803
learning all there is to know about mines.

79
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,078
I was, but now I know all about it

80
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,355
and I'm here to help Pop with his.

81
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,344
I hear it's a whopper.

82
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:01,953
Well, if it is, Pop and
you won't have it long.

83
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:03,176
- What do you mean?
- You'll sell out.

84
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,377
Oh, no, we won't.

85
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,802
Oh, yes, you will, or
lose it all together.

86
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,509
Looks like we find
mines to stake 'em out

87
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,261
for the syndicate, not for ourselves.

88
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,170
No, we sell 'em cheap
or they kick us off.

89
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,157
Well, what happened to the law?

90
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:15,198
The law's on a vacation up here.

91
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,766
Ask your friend Pete.

92
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,177
Well, I aim to but, I
missed him at the post office.

93
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,933
Oh, well, he'll show up later.

94
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,000
Have a little drink?

95
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,277
Thanks, I don't mind if I do.

96
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:26,193
(laughing)

97
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:27,771
- Oh, good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

98
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,054
Well, how's the Chamber
of Commerce tonight?

99
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,869
(chuckling) Fine, thanks.

100
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,784
Hey, as a rule, you should
change the name of this place

101
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:34,616
from the Palace to the (mumbles).

102
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,057
(laughing)

103
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,396
Yeah, how would you
like to make a trade?

104
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,834
Your place here for half
interest in my bank.

105
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:41,610
Well, I don't know what for.

106
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,450
After all, they withdraw
their money from you

107
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:45,141
and deposit it with me.

108
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,266
(laughing)

109
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:51,000
(audience applauding)

110
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,751
(big band music)

111
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,110
I'd gladly give you my entire store

112
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,398
for an interest in Roxie there.

113
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,337
That's a deal, your store
and all the gold in Alaska

114
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,571
and all the tea in China.

115
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,094
- Uh, huh.
(laughing)

116
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,977
- Well, have a good time.
- Thanks.

117
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:14,145
# This is the story of a fool and his gold

118
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,427
- Come on, let's get a table.
# This is the story

119
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:20,516
# That has never been told

120
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:23,352
# I'll tell you how it started

121
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:26,133
# And how they really parted

122
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:30,217
# Just listen to my fable unfold

123
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,648
# There was a lady who
was painted and bold

124
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:42,295
# Skin just like marble
and a heart twice as cold

125
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,990
# The gold was her religion

126
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,811
# And he was such a pigeon

127
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:52,979
# More pity on that fool and his gold

128
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:58,341
# His poor old heart was brittle

129
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:03,219
# Of love he'd been bereft

130
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:08,788
# He asked for oh so little

131
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,419
# And that's exactly all that she left

132
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,276
(laughing loudly) Come on
let's have a lot of drinks.

133
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,339
You know I ain't no minor, I'm a sailor.

134
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,942
I can drink plenty, I'm tellin' ya.

135
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,143
All right, sailor, but quiet down,

136
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,543
give the lady a chance to sing.

137
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,377
What?

138
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:32,544
# This is a story of a fool and his gold

139
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:34,676
# Proving the difference...

140
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,294
Oh, I can sing better than that

141
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:39,495
with one had tied behind my back (laughs).

142
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,138
(yodeling)

143
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:43,376
Hey, pipe down, sailor.

144
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:45,717
Hey, don't tell me to pipe down.

145
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,658
Hey, let's have some more drink, come on!

146
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,632
Oh, I'll teach you fellas how to drink.

147
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,781
You don't know how.

148
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:56,089
Hey, don't leave me, don't leave me.

149
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,840
Hey, don't leave, where we goin'?

150
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:04,445
# That painted gold collector

151
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:09,820
# Is the only one who really got stuck

152
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,666
# This is the payoff and
it's time that it's told

153
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:22,280
# True that she took him
for his bundle of gold

154
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,476
# Here's the part that's funny

155
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:28,894
# It was stolen money

156
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:31,725
# All her work was wasted

157
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:34,477
# 'Cause the sheriff traced it

158
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:37,038
# Found it on her person

159
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,069
# And which there's nothing worsen

160
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,590
# Whosie goes to prison

161
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,463
# Who taketh what ain't hisen

162
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:49,988
# So don't be smart and try to part a fool

163
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,572
# And his gold

164
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,361
(audience applauding)

165
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,439
(crowd chattering)

166
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:14,649
Hey Nick, who busted up my number?

167
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,817
Some big guy down there.

168
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,589
Hello, stranger.

169
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,897
Hello.

170
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:29,496
How'd you like my act?

171
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,591
Well, it gets you a drink.

172
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:35,040
Well, I didn't like
yours, and it gets you this.

173
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,834
(laughing) Just a case
of mistaken identity.

174
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,195
And she (mumbles) wants me in a cup.

175
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,169
Well, why didn't you stop her?

176
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,896
Well, (mumbles) didn't stop her.

177
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,254
The person last March didn't stop her,

178
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,088
who am I to...

179
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,810
Besides, she slaps too fast.

180
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,644
Who is she?

181
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:51,681
Roxie Reagan, she's billed
as the Queen of Yukon.

182
00:10:51,682 --> 00:10:53,654
- Queen got a king?
- Yeah, a king of spades.

183
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,835
They ought to bury him
with his own shovel.

184
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:58,632
Listen to me, brother, that
Roxie plays with a full deck.

185
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,021
No room even for a joker?

186
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,238
Not unless you wanna
finish the game face down,

187
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,489
in the discard.

188
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:06,308
I'll take a chance.

189
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,882
Oh, Roxie.

190
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,363
Yes?

191
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,295
How about having supper with me tonight,

192
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,938
after your last number?

193
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,420
Just to celebrate.

194
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,639
Whose birthday is it this time,

195
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,897
yours or George Washington's?

196
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,665
(laughing) Both, we
were twins, you know.

197
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,086
Not tonight, I've really got to go home.

198
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,006
Not even for a little while?

199
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,331
No, I've been neglecting John too much.

200
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,246
Maybe that's why he's...

201
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:35,094
But surely, you can't be
in love with that drunkard?

202
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,125
Look, Tom, you've been swell.

203
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,939
I like working for you.

204
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,326
But let's leave it at that, hmm?

205
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,577
All right, if you say so.

206
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:49,275
(crowd chattering)

207
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,219
Ah, Gary, Gary Corbett (laughs).

208
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,812
Petey, hi, boy am I glad to see you.

209
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:58,840
Is that so?

210
00:11:58,841 --> 00:11:59,674
Well, why didn't you come straight

211
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,263
to the old postmaster when you got here?

212
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:02,210
Well, it was after store hours,

213
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:03,731
so I figured I'd wait for you here.

214
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:04,625
How bout something to eat?

215
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,918
Come on, I could eat the hip of a horse.

216
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,082
You probably will.

217
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,584
Yeah, say Joe, bring us a couple of them

218
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,973
porterhouse steaks, rare, flock of onions,

219
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,513
golden brown stack of
french fries, you know.

220
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,799
Yes, sir, Postmaster.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,467
Come on Gary, let's
go eat somethin', huh?

222
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:26,358
Say, Pete, the letter I
got was in your handwriting.

223
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,120
Why didn't Pop write me himself?

224
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,016
He couldn't spell fabulous.

225
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,292
You mean the mine's that good?

226
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,297
No, but if somebody
doesn't take it away from ya,

227
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,695
you and your old man don't
have to worry from now on.

228
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:40,156
Imagine Pops striking it
rich after all these years.

229
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,969
Well, nobody deserves
it more than he does.

230
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,731
Now don't go leaving
yourself out, you old galute.

231
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:45,694
Where would he be if you hadn't been

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,046
staking him year after year?

233
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,833
Well, I got faith in him,
same as I got faith in Alaska.

234
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,072
I hope you're gonna stay
home for awhile now.

235
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,077
Home is where the gold is.

236
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,000
Not only gold, it's the land.

237
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,561
Son, you better settle
here and raise yourself

238
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,645
a crop of good Americans.

239
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:07,145
(crowd chattering)

240
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:09,811
Say, do I see a peculiar glint

241
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,506
in your elderly but active eyes?

242
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,060
Yes, and if you'll listen carefully,

243
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,883
you can hear me lickin' my chops.

244
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:19,051
I'm the oldest fool on
Roxie's list (chuckles).

245
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,572
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello, darling.

246
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,774
Roxy, I want you to meet Gary Corbett.

247
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:30,364
Gary, shake hands with Roxie Reagan.

248
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,778
You mind if I get acquainted
with your left hand?

249
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,407
I've already met your right.

250
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:37,807
Ah, I'm terribly sorry,
the bartender told me.

251
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,173
I mistook Mr. Corbett for a
drunk and slapped his face.

252
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,758
- Oh.
(laughing)

253
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,991
You will forgive me, won't you?

254
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:45,563
Oh, why yes, of course not.

255
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:48,571
What I mean to say is,
the pleasure was all mine.

256
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:49,743
What's this all about?

257
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:50,909
Won't you sit down?

258
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,827
I, I, I really can't.

259
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:54,879
Will you have supper with me?

260
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,919
Oh, yes, I'd love to.

261
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,458
Eh, what'll you have, Roxie?

262
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,708
Just some scrambled
eggs and coffee, waiter.

263
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,042
Bring me the same, please.

264
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,661
Well, I've read about this in books,

265
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,617
but I never saw it in real life before.

266
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,663
(laughing) Goodness.

267
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,664
(light, happy orchestral music)

268
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,411
Ah, what have we here?

269
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,097
Forsooth, a canine.

270
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,809
(crowd laughing)

271
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,143
Art lonesome for thy master?

272
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,481
Well, so am I for mine.

273
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,416
Only mine wears a skirt.

274
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,167
(crowd laughing)

275
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:58,387
No?

276
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,603
I wish that I had your wisdom,

277
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:04,187
to scorn the cup that destroys.

278
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,263
Romans, countrymen, and lovers.

279
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:14,859
Hear me for my cause, and be silent!

280
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,501
(crowd laughing)

281
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:23,751
If there be any among you,

282
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:26,085
any dear friend of Caesar's,

283
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,151
to him I say,

284
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,544
not that I love Roxie less,

285
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,472
but that I love this more!

286
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,223
(crowd laughing)

287
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,740
Why, I was in San
Francisco at the same time.

288
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,911
No.

289
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,536
Hey, Roxie, do you know the
cigar store on Market Street,

290
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,363
the one with the wooden
Indian in front of it?

291
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,053
With the dress store right next to it.

292
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,316
Yeah, that's the one.

293
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,950
To think that we might have met then.

294
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,888
You going in for a cigar
and me going in for a dress.

295
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,673
(laughing)

296
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:01,841
(crowd chattering)
(light orchestral music)

297
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,287
Sorry to interrupt, but...

298
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,611
Same as usual?

299
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:10,366
A little worse, I'm afraid.

300
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,566
Where in the world does he get it?

301
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:14,258
I've asked everybody in town
to help me straighten him out.

302
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,751
Not here, none of my bartenders
would give him anything.

303
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,927
We're talking about my husband.

304
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,089
Very charming gentleman,

305
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,454
but a hopeless drinker, I'm afraid.

306
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,747
I'll take him home.

307
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:28,699
No, your number is on shortly.

308
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,339
Nick and I will take him home.

309
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,090
Thanks, Tom, you're very sweet.

310
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,651
- Gary...
- Yes, Mrs. Reagan?

311
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,730
It's one of those difficult situations.

312
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,112
I couldn't explain it in the first hour.

313
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,995
I'm glad it explained
itself in the first hour.

314
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,426
You shouldn't leave your wedding
ring at home, Mrs. Reagan.

315
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,785
Without it, some darn fool
might get some darn fool ideas.

316
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,369
(clinking)
Bye.

317
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,157
Gary.

318
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,938
Well, so long, Pete.

319
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,604
You're not gonna start for
the mine tonight, are you?

320
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,775
Yes, I always do things the hard way.

321
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:12,609
Bye.

322
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:17,111
(whistling)

323
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:21,575
Stop whistling, you drunkard.

324
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:25,743
My peace is addled enough
without that wail of a banshee.

325
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,538
Maybe you better stop drinking.

326
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,797
I have that in mind, my good innkeeper,

327
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:36,713
when and if I choose (laughs).

328
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,133
Now you think you could stop.

329
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:40,967
Instantly, but not too suddenly.

330
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,294
You did bring me some, didn't you?

331
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,030
All right, let him have it.

332
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,781
Ah (chuckles).

333
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,523
I'd ask you, gentlemen, to join me,

334
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:56,604
but unfortunately, my wife is supposed to.

335
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:59,136
If you tell her that I gave it to you,

336
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:02,054
I'll wring your Shakespearean neck.

337
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,987
You have my permission, sir.

338
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:10,513
Well, you won't get another drop.

339
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:14,097
That will be a far,
far greater calamity.

340
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:27,536
Good wine is a good familiar
creature if well used.

341
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:29,787
Exclaim no more against it.

342
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:36,517
If I was crazy about a gal,

343
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,792
I'd bend so she'd get a divorce.

344
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:41,157
The trouble with Dr. Reagan
is his marriage is for keeps.

345
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:42,665
Yeah, but she don't love him.

346
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,625
No, but she thinks he needs her.

347
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,091
Listen, Leroux, suppose he kicks off?

348
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,924
She would leave right away
and she wouldn't come back.

349
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,888
No, my best bet is to
leave things as they are

350
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:55,056
for the time being anyway.

351
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,502
Roxie, Roxie, you're on.

352
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:09,573
(audience applauding)

353
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,760
(slow orchestral music)

354
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:24,269
(Roxie singing, lyrics indistinct)

355
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:57,534
(bold orchestral music)

356
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,219
(gun firing)

357
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,137
(melancholic orchestral music)

358
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,548
Pop, Pop!

359
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:34,538
(melancholic orchestral music)

360
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,269
(fast beat orchestral music)

361
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,518
(guns firing)

362
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:12,178
(firing)

363
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,498
(firing)

364
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,306
(firing)

365
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,521
(firing)

366
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:37,749
[Man On Mountain] Let's get outta here.

367
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:44,433
(upbeat suspenseful orchestral music)

368
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,466
(melancholic orchestral music)

369
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,754
They won't get away with it, partner.

370
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,973
(dog barking)

371
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:36,596
Drop that gun, Corbett.

372
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,213
Now come forward.

373
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:49,847
Hello, Corbett.

374
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,737
I'm John Masters, United States Marshal.

375
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,721
I'm arresting you for murder.

376
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:56,250
They're the murderers.

377
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,470
They killed my father.

378
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:59,408
Let's let the court worry about that.

379
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,326
I'm taking you to Juno.

380
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:10,704
Two names scratched, huh?

381
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:12,549
We'll have to hang you twice.

382
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,550
Good joke.

383
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,408
I'll get the rest.

384
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,890
That's the wrong attitude, Corbett.

385
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:20,474
Now get your stuff.

386
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:28,556
(slow, mysterious orchestral music)

387
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:46,829
(people chattering)

388
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:00,399
Gary Corbett, handcuffed.

389
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,876
Pete, Pete!

390
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:08,994
Pete, Pete!

391
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:10,475
[Pete] Huh?

392
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:11,900
- Come here, hurry.
- What's the matter?

393
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,484
Come on, come on.

394
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:19,891
[Pete] What's the matter, son?

395
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,026
What do you got him for, Marshal?

396
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:21,860
[Marshal] Murder.

397
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,709
[Pete] What about it, Gary?

398
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,261
[Gary] Yeah, a bunch of
claim jumpers murdered Pop,

399
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,563
and I got a couple of them.

400
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,713
[Pete] Well, a man has
got a right to protect

401
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:27,860
his own property, hasn't he?

402
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,165
[Man] You can't hold
a man for that, Marshal.

403
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,258
[Man] No, and he ain't goin' to.

404
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:31,941
[Man] Come on now, Marshal,
take off those irons.

405
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:33,115
I'll take 'em off and put one on you

406
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:34,432
if you don't get outta here.

407
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,295
[Man] I'm telling you,
you better take 'em off.

408
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:38,115
Hold on, wait a minute,
wait a minute here.

409
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:39,942
What happens to him is up to a jury.

410
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:42,788
(men talking excitedly)

411
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,339
I'm taking him to Juno.

412
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,173
Now I don't want any trouble,

413
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:46,788
but if you fellows want it, you'll get it.

414
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,225
(men talking excitedly)

415
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,760
Wait a minute men, wait a minute.

416
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,644
The marshal's right.

417
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:56,674
Nobody wants to see that
boy free more than I do.

418
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:57,779
When they killed his dad,

419
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,271
they killed one of the
best friends I ever had.

420
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:02,122
Now we gotta get Gary out of this.

421
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:03,808
But we're gonna do it the American way,

422
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:04,916
with law and order.

423
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,185
Now you're talkin' sense, Pete.

424
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:08,938
Now go on, scatter
fellows, scatter, go ahead.

425
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:10,708
(men grumbling)

426
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,180
Don't say nothin' to nobody now, Gary

427
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:13,699
and we'll try and think what to do.

428
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,268
Let's get somethin' to
eat here in The Palace.

429
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:19,436
I'll be over there and
see you in a little while.

430
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:24,847
Corbett, if you'd behave yourself

431
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,360
I'll take these things off,

432
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,811
at least until we've had something to eat.

433
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:30,759
I'm going to square things my way.

434
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,264
I'm wanna take the first
chance I get to do it.

435
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,374
Glad you warned me.

436
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,456
Do we have to go in here?

437
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:39,706
What's the matter with it?

438
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,874
(mumbles)

439
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,797
(crowd chattering)

440
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:59,344
(audience applauding)

441
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:06,315
# Forget if you can

442
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:12,189
# The moment we knew

443
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,725
# Let memories fade

444
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:21,893
# Of plans that we made
that never came true

445
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,118
# Forget if you can

446
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:33,412
# My arms about you

447
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,592
# Our favorite tune

448
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:44,260
# Our favorite moon, or two

449
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:53,028
# Forget if you will

450
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,196
# The moment that will reveal every dream

451
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:05,972
# Don't reminisce, don't think of the kiss

452
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,961
# That sealed every dream

453
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:17,410
# We couldn't pretend,
so it came to an end

454
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:23,299
# Before it began

455
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,835
# So shouldn't we both

456
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:31,836
# Forget if you can

457
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,844
(audience applauding)

458
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:48,674
(light, happy orchestral music)

459
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,395
- Hello, Roxie.
- Oh, please don't get up.

460
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,791
- Hello, Gary.
- Hello.

461
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,167
- Won't you sit with us?
- Just for a minute.

462
00:27:58,168 --> 00:28:00,116
I see you still don't like my act.

463
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:01,666
I like it very much.

464
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,417
You didn't applaud.

465
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,412
What did you do?

466
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:08,920
The marshal calls it murder.

467
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,722
That's what the warrant calls it.

468
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,454
Does he have to wear these things?

469
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:15,473
He doesn't have to, Roxie.

470
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,410
I offered to take 'em off
if he'd give me his word,

471
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,296
- but he refused to...
- All right, Marshal,

472
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,297
you have it.

473
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,303
Well, tell me about it.

474
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,909
There isn't much to tell.

475
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,330
Bunch of claim jumpers killed
my father and stole his mine.

476
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,662
So far I've been able to get two of 'em.

477
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:32,909
Who were they?

478
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,544
- Madison and Holden.
- Madison?

479
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,781
Yes, did you know them?

480
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,779
Well, only through Leroux.

481
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,697
They were friends of his, you know?

482
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:45,060
Hello, how are you?

483
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,444
You know Mr. Corbett?

484
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:48,545
Glad to see you again.

485
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, see you later.

486
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,248
Roxie, why don't you stay
and have supper with us?

487
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:55,666
No, thanks, I'm having supper with Tom.

488
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:06,128
(light, bouncy orchestral music)

489
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,533
Shall we eat in my dressing room?

490
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,286
Great, I'll be up in a minute.

491
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:13,865
Give me time to change.

492
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:16,561
You know you're a funny girl.

493
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:17,480
I am?

494
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:22,096
Yes, first night in a year
I haven't asked you to supper,

495
00:29:22,097 --> 00:29:24,012
and you ask me.

496
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,411
Gal's entitled to a change of mind.

497
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:27,671
And heart.

498
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:31,755
I don't know, mine never
seem to work together.

499
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:43,254
I'm glad you took them
things off him, Marshal.

500
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:44,566
You know, I've been thinkin' about

501
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,893
this epidemic of claim jumpin'.

502
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,150
There's brains behind it,

503
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,510
tight, smooth-workin' organization.

504
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:51,907
We just found out that the two I shot

505
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:53,076
were friends of Leroux's.

506
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:54,349
- What?
- Say Pete,

507
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,743
what do you know about this Judge Bennett

508
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,604
who signed the eviction notice?

509
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:58,808
Well, you fellas are wastin' your time

510
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,578
because those eviction notices are legal.

511
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,046
Pete, you miners spend so
much time lookin' for gold

512
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:07,375
you forget the little matter
of paying your assessment.

513
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,948
Well, Pop paid his.

514
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:11,843
Fine, that's good, where's your receipt?

515
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,370
You show that to me and I'll,

516
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:15,433
I'll chase those claim jumpers off so fast

517
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:17,053
it'll make your head swim.

518
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:18,663
Well, you didn't give me
much time to look for it.

519
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:21,427
Wouldn't done you any
good, son, it isn't there.

520
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,248
First thing them bandits go for.

521
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,939
They not only rob and kill decent men,

522
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,839
but they're makin' a joke out
of the territory of Alaska.

523
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,558
Look, Masters, if you'll
give me few days free time,

524
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,288
I bet I can find out who this
Judge Bennett's working for.

525
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:37,875
Then we'll know who really
should be tried for murder.

526
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:41,101
That's a good idea, only
I can't give you free time.

527
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:41,944
Why not?

528
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:44,150
You can't get outta here
for a couple of days yet.

529
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:45,120
The Yukon's a roarin' flood,

530
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,121
you can't get across till it settles down.

531
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:50,192
Well, tell you what I'll do, Pete.

532
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,581
How'd you like to be a
deputy United States Marshal?

533
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:54,956
I'm postmaster now.

534
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:57,380
Well, we'll say just
for a few days, and then,

535
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:00,758
well, if Corbett here
doesn't behave (laughing)

536
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,636
the government can take
it out of your hide.

537
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:06,266
All right, Marshal, you
got yourself a deputy.

538
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:09,025
Postmaster, U.S. deputy.

539
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:13,193
Maybe I'll run for governor
next, huh? (laughing)

540
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:16,780
(knocking at door)

541
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:17,614
Come in.

542
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:20,690
Where's Mr. Leroux?

543
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,458
He's still in his office, Mademoiselle.

544
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:23,459
Thank you.

545
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:28,869
(flowing orchestral music)

546
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,967
[Tom] I'll tell you, this
man Corbett's a dangerous man

547
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,816
to have running around loose.

548
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:49,021
But he's not loose, sir, he's
in Marshal Masters' custody.

549
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:50,076
Well, Corbett has enough friends

550
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,909
to take him away from 10 marshals

551
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,553
once they get out of town
and hit the Juno trail.

552
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:55,761
[Man] Is there a
reason why he should ever

553
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:57,389
get to the Juno trail?

554
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,549
Yes, I hear since the
blizzard, the wolves and bears

555
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,511
walk right into town these dark nights.

556
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:03,445
- [Man In Black Vest]
And it's a public duty

557
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:04,291
to shoot 'em down.

558
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:06,901
Anybody can make a mistake.

559
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,938
[Tom] Shooting Corbett is one thing,

560
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,003
you've gotta be jolly well careful

561
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:12,254
if the marshal is with him.

562
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:19,566
Oh, Roxie, Leroux said to tell you

563
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,692
he'll be up in about 10 minutes.

564
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:22,133
Thanks, Nick, where's the marshal?

565
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:23,217
Over there.

566
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:26,013
[Roxie] Oh, Marshal.

567
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,431
Hello, Roxie, have a drink.

568
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:30,860
Where's Gary?

569
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,762
Oh, he just left, I hope
he's not too far away.

570
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:35,053
You let him go alone?

571
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,584
He is all right.

572
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:37,586
Not without you.

573
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:38,717
You've got to go after him right away.

574
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,380
Don't leave his side for a minute.

575
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:41,321
Why?

576
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:43,872
Because, because his life's in danger.

577
00:32:43,873 --> 00:32:44,990
What makes you think so?

578
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:48,984
I, I can't tell you now,
but he mustn't be left alone.

579
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,151
Well, he's with Pete, they'll
take care of themselves.

580
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,397
They don't care how many
of his friends they kill.

581
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:54,774
He'd only be safe if you were with him,

582
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:56,694
someone they didn't dare hurt.

583
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:59,112
Well, I'll try to find him.

584
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:04,107
(upbeat orchestral music)

585
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,878
(tense music)

586
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:19,565
No, no, don't stop,
I'll walk along with you.

587
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:20,786
You look like you had
a drink with the devil.

588
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:22,892
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

589
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:25,002
I wish women would stop
saying, "Oh, nothing."

590
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,407
Me too, when they say, "Oh, nothing,"

591
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,881
I'm off like a rocky mountain goat.

592
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:28,715
I'll see you later.

593
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,516
Oh, please don't go, I,
I only want to say goodbye.

594
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:34,201
To this fellow without a chaperone.

595
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:35,780
Hey, Pete, Pete.

596
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,614
Come on.

597
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,433
What on earth's the matter with you?

598
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:44,017
Nevermind, just keep walking.

599
00:33:44,924 --> 00:33:46,382
You shouldn't have come
out on a cold night like this

600
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:49,136
- in that thin dress.
- I know it.

601
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:50,271
Maybe you better turn back.

602
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,868
I'm going home.

603
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,107
Then you better put my coat on.

604
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,525
No, don't stop.

605
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,827
I don't wanna take a
chance on hitting her.

606
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,299
No, Tom would kill us.

607
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,555
What's she doin' with him anyway?

608
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,818
Had they rained all
kinds of sores and shames

609
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:06,839
on my bare head,

610
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,165
steeped me in poverty to the very lips.

611
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,629
Must be pretty tough goin'.

612
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,547
At times.

613
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:14,957
Someday people will realize

614
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,861
that an alcoholic isn't a bad man.

615
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:21,095
Make me the fixed figure
of the time for scorn

616
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:24,676
to point his slow and moving finger at.

617
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:26,927
Yet could I bear that, too.

618
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:37,724
I'm glad you like my performance, sir.

619
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,973
Roxie, my dear, I present canine Rex,

620
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:46,693
the king among dogs.

621
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:48,098
Unheralded and unsung,

622
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,516
he came to see my performance of Othello.

623
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,624
Who's our other guest?

624
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:02,153
This is Mr. Corbett,
he owns the dog and...

625
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:04,071
Congratulations, sir.

626
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,562
My husband, Mr. Reagan.

627
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,556
Congratulations, sir.

628
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:13,117
I seem to have a rival
for the dog's affection.

629
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:16,788
You should, after all, the dog's his.

630
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,033
I will avoid the obvious parallel.

631
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,558
John, I'd like Mr. Corbett
to stay here all night.

632
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,733
Well, I'm, I'm staying with Pete.

633
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,053
No, the dangerous part is getting back,

634
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,758
you don't understand.

635
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,105
[Gary] I think I do, those
men who were following us.

636
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,631
Why take chances, what
can you lose by staying?

637
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,715
Yes, what can you lose?

638
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,491
You might even gain, who knows what?

639
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:40,325
John.

640
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,901
(pensive music)

641
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:48,703
(clinking)

642
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,806
Sir, how would you like to trade?

643
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,086
Trade what?

644
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,797
My wife for your dog.

645
00:35:58,798 --> 00:35:59,631
You're drunk.

646
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:04,304
Of course, I'm drunk, that's
why I'm speaking the truth.

647
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:08,472
Have you never heard the
old saying, in vino veritas?

648
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:13,886
He understands, he's a
remarkable quadruped.

649
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,476
He even appreciates Shakespeare.

650
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:20,181
My friend and critic.

651
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:29,192
But that I am forbid to tell
the secrets of my prison house.

652
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:31,423
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

653
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,806
would harrow up thy soul.

654
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:37,797
Freeze thy young blood,
make thy two eyes like stars

655
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,734
start from their spheres.

656
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:42,503
Thy knotted and combined locks to part.

657
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,551
And each particular hair to stand on end,

658
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:48,424
Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.

659
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,370
But this eternal blazon must not be

660
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,172
to ears of flesh and blood.

661
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,923
List, list, oh, list.

662
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:00,962
If ever thy dear father thou didst love,

663
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:04,546
revenge his foul and
most unnatural murder.

664
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,650
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.

665
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:12,151
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

666
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,369
Seems even Shakespeare knew

667
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,849
what was going on in Moose River.

668
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,277
Thanks Roxie, goodnight.

669
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:25,493
Gary, please don't.

670
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:29,327
Stop worrying, we'll
be all right, all of us.

671
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:30,495
Come on, Dike.

672
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:33,079
Come on, Dike.

673
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:41,731
This is pretty tough going, John.

674
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:42,732
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,107
I made a mistake.

676
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,691
I guess we all do.

677
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:50,671
The worse mistake you
ever made was to marry me.

678
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:51,756
And then to run away with me

679
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:54,969
when the law came yapping at my heals.

680
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,898
Even now it's only through a
misguided sense of loyalty.

681
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,816
I don't think that
loyalty is ever misguided.

682
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:08,656
[John] You love him, don't you?

683
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:11,157
I'm trying very hard not to.

684
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:22,705
(people chattering)

685
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:30,476
You will see, Judge Bennett,

686
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,003
that these are simple statements of fact.

687
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:34,002
Proving that we did pay our assessments.

688
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,439
Affidavits aren't proof.

689
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,734
You're not trying this case, Judge.

690
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:38,478
All we want you to do is
certify our signatures

691
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:40,535
and put that little red seal on it.

692
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:43,387
Aren't you men being
somewhat hasty about all this?

693
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,061
You didn't hesitate to certify papers

694
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,956
that threw us off of our property.

695
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,581
Those evictions were perfectly legal.

696
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:52,208
We'll let the high court
in Juno decide that, Judge.

697
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:55,689
Now young man, you know
that won't do you any good.

698
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,293
As a defendant in a murder
charge, you have no standing

699
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,933
in the civil court until the...

700
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,223
Nevermind the speech, Bennett,

701
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:03,219
all we want is your John Hancock.

702
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,255
And you ain't got no right
to refuse us, have ya?

703
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:09,423
Oh no, it's perfectly legal,
but it's a waste of time.

704
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:19,627
There you are, men, that'll be $2 a piece.

705
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:20,679
- $2?
- What for?

706
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,221
Well, you're a public
officer, ain't you?

707
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:24,073
It's the regular recorder's fee.

708
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:24,907
It's...

709
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:26,907
[Men] Perfectly legal.

710
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:33,737
(people chattering)

711
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,479
[Marshal] Hi, boys.

712
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,967
See, now you've offended me, Marshall.

713
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,821
You've got my word, haven't you?

714
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:48,282
Have you changed your mind?

715
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:50,770
No, not at all, I
just wanted you to know

716
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,413
that the trail is open, Corbett,

717
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,971
and we're leaving first
thing in the morning.

718
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:59,055
I thought you'd like to
know as soon as possible.

719
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,736
(upbeat orchestral music)

720
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:35,075
Who's that?

721
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:35,926
Jones and Bailey.

722
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:37,656
They must've kicked something in the dark.

723
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:38,945
Better go down and keep 'em quiet.

724
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:42,731
Well, I hope you find something
that'll do us some good.

725
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,460
That does it.

726
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:47,461
(suspenseful music)

727
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:22,100
(lively orchestral music)
(applauding)

728
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,126
# You can't forget the
menu at the Poker and Waltz

729
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:30,210
# For they're the nicest
dancers that I know

730
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:33,348
# But don't forget the
menu at the Poker and Waltz

731
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,318
# Our dances are that cannot do alone

732
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,734
# But if you can, can, can

733
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:39,395
# You're not a (muffled)

734
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,417
# Just imitate the kangaroo

735
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,110
# You get your pose about

736
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:45,771
# Just all your woes about

737
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:49,493
# Like the fellow that followed you

738
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:52,483
# Show your knees and dimples please

739
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:55,405
# A bit of this you'll never miss

740
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:56,883
# For if you can, can, can

741
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,429
# Then you can plant your man

742
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,513
# And maybe he can, can, can too

743
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:06,849
(audience applauding)

744
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:11,735
(lively orchestral music)

745
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:55,435
(audience applauding)

746
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,307
Certainly has a nice
(mumbles) of girls up there.

747
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:06,576
Yeah, you sure have got an
eye for the girls, Tyler, huh?

748
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:08,416
How'd you get here so quick, Judge?

749
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,119
What do you mean, I've
been here for two hours.

750
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,583
Now wait a minute, I just seen you

751
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:14,285
movin' around your office.

752
00:43:14,286 --> 00:43:15,809
You what?

753
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,034
At least, I thought it was you.

754
00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:19,340
The blind was down, but there was a light.

755
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,835
Is somebody tryin' to get
something on you, Judge?

756
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,492
That's not funny, come on.

757
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:25,481
Wait a minute, we
better see Tom first, huh?

758
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:27,004
Yeah, the boss'll wanna know about this.

759
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,088
[Man] Yeah.

760
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:39,456
Yes, it's Corbett all right,
there's no doubt about it.

761
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:41,753
Pick up your boys and get
over there as fast as you can.

762
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:42,861
But no shooting.

763
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:45,320
- Why not?
- What for?

764
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,564
Pin a burglary charge on 'em.

765
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:49,041
Let's see what happens when
Corbett takes his case to Juno.

766
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:52,055
Yes, that's the way to do
it, I never thought of that.

767
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,562
Uh, should Carter and I go along?

768
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:54,675
By all means.

769
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,649
Two outstanding citizens for witness,

770
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,780
- it will make it per...
- Yes, perfectly legal.

771
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:01,104
Wasn't that what you were about to say?

772
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,450
(laughing)

773
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,254
Well come on boys, let's get started.

774
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,755
[Man] See you later, Leroux.

775
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,373
Well, we might've known
Bennett wouldn't leave

776
00:44:10,374 --> 00:44:13,374
anything important here in the office.

777
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,875
- Oh, but he has.
- Did you find something?

778
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:19,722
Come on, let's go.

779
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:20,965
Wait a minute.

780
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:23,883
We don't wanna be caught in here.

781
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,096
(suspenseful music)

782
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:47,032
They're on the way over.

783
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:47,866
We'll hide in the shadows.

784
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:48,823
When they come close, we'll jump 'em.

785
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:50,990
You two hide around there.

786
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:54,814
[Man] The light's not on.

787
00:44:54,815 --> 00:44:56,003
I wonder if they're still inside.

788
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:57,921
[Man] Let's find out.

789
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:00,921
[Man] What, hey, hey.

790
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:04,635
[Man] Help, help!

791
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:06,434
Help!

792
00:45:07,484 --> 00:45:08,976
Help!

793
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:12,758
[Man] Hey, now where do we get them?

794
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:13,592
[Man] Help!

795
00:45:13,593 --> 00:45:15,041
[Man] Hey, somebody's fighting here.

796
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:17,459
I wonder what it's all about.

797
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,633
How many pounds of coffee do you want?

798
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,087
[John] You better
make it a couple, Pete.

799
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:22,921
Two.

800
00:45:31,107 --> 00:45:33,499
Look, Marshal, there was
a, there was somethin'

801
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,779
I wanted to ask you, I...

802
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,587
Yes, I know what you want
Pete, but I can't do it.

803
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:40,381
I've overdue in Juno now as it is.

804
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:42,268
- Oh.
- Got any beans up there?

805
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:43,372
Yeah.

806
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,958
And some salmon too, Pete.

807
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,709
There's your beans.

808
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:53,505
Say, Marshal, Gary's got a little hunch

809
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:57,087
he wants to follow up, but he
needs a little time on it...

810
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,644
How'd last night's hunch work out?

811
00:45:58,645 --> 00:45:59,478
Huh?

812
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:02,390
Come on now, Pete, you know
you're legally my deputy.

813
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:05,724
Legally, right now I'm sellin' salmon.

814
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:11,302
Where'd you get that cut?

815
00:46:11,303 --> 00:46:13,662
You mean this little scratch on my face?

816
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:16,373
Yeah, and don't tell
me you got it shaving.

817
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,439
(laughs) Well, no (laughs).

818
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,618
I had a little bit too
much to drink last night

819
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,016
and I come in here to light the lamp

820
00:46:22,017 --> 00:46:25,140
and I fell against the counter (laughs).

821
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,105
Sure you didn't get it outside

822
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:28,985
Judge Bennett's office last night?

823
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,541
What happened there?

824
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:31,575
Well, it seems like a bunch of fellas

825
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:33,307
broke into his office last night

826
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:35,668
and turned it upside down
lookin' for somethin'.

827
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:37,786
My goodness, where were you?

828
00:46:37,787 --> 00:46:39,595
I was away.

829
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,935
So the prima absent evidence, eh?

830
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:46,499
(laughing) Here's your
salmon, anything else?

831
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,437
No, this oughta do it.

832
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,770
You about ready, Corbett?

833
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:52,771
[Gary] I'll be packed in a minute.

834
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,631
Now, how much do I owe you?

835
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,713
Let's see, get your
hands outta the raisins.

836
00:46:58,714 --> 00:46:59,881
Two hard pack.

837
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:06,280
Listen, Marshal, give that
boy a couple of days more.

838
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,241
- Can't do it.
- Just one day then.

839
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:11,984
Not for his sake, not for my sake,

840
00:47:11,985 --> 00:47:14,464
but for the sake of the justice
you're suppose to represent

841
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,573
in this great territory of Alaska.

842
00:47:16,574 --> 00:47:19,467
(laughing) Ah, Tratchall
I'd beat you a run

843
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:21,343
for congressional delegate.

844
00:47:21,344 --> 00:47:22,315
Can you do it?

845
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:24,848
One day, and it's as
much as my badge is worth.

846
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:26,632
(laughing) I could kiss you for that.

847
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:29,192
Here have so more raisins,
go on, take 'em all.

848
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,136
(both laughing)

849
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:34,637
(bouncy orchestral music)

850
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,476
[Roxie] Hello, Pete.

851
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,834
(knocking at door)

852
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:48,668
Come in.

853
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,896
Hello.

854
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:55,927
You shouldn't have come here.

855
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:58,151
I heard you were
leaving this morning and

856
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:01,418
I couldn't let you go without
at least saying goodbye.

857
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:04,002
I'll be here for another day.

858
00:48:05,391 --> 00:48:07,356
Let me fix that breakfast.

859
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:08,484
Are you a good cook?

860
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,652
You'll know in a minute.

861
00:48:18,057 --> 00:48:22,057
(slow, gentle orchestral music)

862
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:26,437
Where are the eggs?

863
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:27,623
Over there.

864
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:28,457
Bacon?

865
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,624
I'll get it.

866
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:45,946
Gary.

867
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:47,530
- Yes?
- I...

868
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,239
How do you like your bacon?

869
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,157
With egg.

870
00:48:58,131 --> 00:49:00,720
I wish you didn't have to go, alone.

871
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:02,411
Oh, I won't be alone.

872
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:05,562
The United States is providing
me with a paid companion.

873
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:07,313
Let me go with you.

874
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:11,280
Why, Mrs. Reagan?

875
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,478
Don't you think it's time I
did something about my life?

876
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:15,812
Well, sure.

877
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:18,026
Don't let your heart run away

878
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:19,509
with your tongue, Mr. Corbett.

879
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,116
You say such exciting
things as, "Oh, sure."

880
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:22,987
You'll turn a poor girl's head,

881
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:24,561
make her think you're as
interested in what happens to her

882
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:27,303
as you are in, in breakfast.

883
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:30,387
(slow, gentle music)

884
00:49:46,995 --> 00:49:50,912
What are you trying to
do, burn up the place?

885
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:54,103
(clanking)

886
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:57,740
I'll tell you boss, the
whole town is talkin' about it.

887
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,615
Get Bennett, take him (mumbles).

888
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:01,013
Right, boss.

889
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,599
- Mr. Leroux.
- What is it?

890
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,645
I've received a letter from England.

891
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:05,847
Yeah, tell me about it later.

892
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:07,731
But it's quite important.

893
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:09,482
I said, never mind.

894
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:18,712
At last, give it to me.

895
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,494
You know where Roxie is?

896
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,196
Rehearsing, I suppose.

897
00:50:23,197 --> 00:50:25,428
That's right, rehearsing a love scene

898
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,728
with a new leading man, Gary Corbett.

899
00:50:27,729 --> 00:50:29,773
It's a lie, you're lying your teeth,

900
00:50:29,774 --> 00:50:31,524
you wretched barkeep.

901
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:34,790
Let's go.

902
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,445
Oh, please don't, you've
got to let me have a drink.

903
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,394
Barkeep can't leave if
I give him a way to stop.

904
00:50:40,395 --> 00:50:42,370
Oh, I didn't mean that, I apologize.

905
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:44,256
Apologies won't pay your bill.

906
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:48,332
I'll pay you, I'll get
it from Roxie, some way.

907
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:50,919
Suppose Roxie's not here?

908
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,037
Suppose Roxie goes away with Corbett?

909
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:54,682
Oh, she wouldn't.

910
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:57,766
You can make sure that she doesn't.

911
00:50:58,718 --> 00:51:01,599
I've committed many sins
in my life, but not murder.

912
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,416
Wouldn't be murder to defend your home.

913
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:06,464
No jury would convict you.

914
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:08,495
And every man in Alaska would honor you.

915
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:10,329
Yes, even applaud you.

916
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,835
Why do you want this man dead?

917
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:21,248
Well, I got my reasons,
but not as strong as yours.

918
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:22,916
Well, what about it?

919
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:28,107
I could think better if I had a drink.

920
00:51:28,108 --> 00:51:30,305
Reagan, here's a chance
for you to play a better part

921
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,527
in real life, than you
ever did on the stage.

922
00:51:32,528 --> 00:51:34,137
Give me a drink.

923
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,653
You'd solve all the problems.

924
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:38,033
You could swim in a river of whiskey

925
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:39,994
for the rest of your life.

926
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:42,033
Well what do you say, yes or no?

927
00:51:42,034 --> 00:51:43,367
I can't think.

928
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,260
What kind of a man are you

929
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:49,700
not to defend the honor of your wife?

930
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,676
Mr. Leroux, you are mistaken.

931
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:54,226
I may not be like Caesar, but my wife

932
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:57,492
is like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.

933
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:58,660
Good day, sir.

934
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:03,177
(pensive orchestral music)

935
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,371
You had a good chance of
getting Corbett last night.

936
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:16,354
Instead of that, what did you do?

937
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:17,536
Start fighting each other.

938
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:19,613
- Well, it was dark and...
- Couldn't see a thing.

939
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:20,737
(knocking at door)

940
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,571
Yes?

941
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,457
- Oh, hello, Marshal.
- Hello, Tom.

942
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,922
Big time last night, huh?

943
00:52:27,923 --> 00:52:30,532
- Yes, we had, uh...
- We sure,

944
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,490
now listen here, Marshal,
we, respected citizens

945
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:33,902
of Moose River resent a murderer

946
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:35,827
runnin' around loose on our street.

947
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:37,210
And after all, Marshal,

948
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:39,193
a prisoner in Judge Bennett's jurisdiction

949
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:40,772
should be in his custody.

950
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:41,606
That's right.

951
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,511
Is the Corbett mine
located in Moose River?

952
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:44,922
Just outside.

953
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:46,811
Well then, as long as your
city limits don't extend

954
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:49,945
to the scene of the crime, he's
still my prisoner, isn't he?

955
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:51,805
What about the crime
he committed last night,

956
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:53,206
breaking into my office?

957
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:54,546
That's Moose River, isn't it?

958
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:56,954
Sure, but can you prove he did it?

959
00:52:56,955 --> 00:52:58,745
Yes, Tobin and I can identify...

960
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:02,515
(laughing) What, with those blinkers?

961
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:05,538
Boys, you'll have to think up
somethin' smarter than that.

962
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:06,372
So long.

963
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,277
(door slams)

964
00:53:10,278 --> 00:53:12,586
Well, what do we do now?

965
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:14,422
I think somethin' oughta
be done about Reagan.

966
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:15,473
What about Reagan?

967
00:53:15,474 --> 00:53:17,733
I heard him yellin' about
what we'd done to old Corbett.

968
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:20,547
Something about, if you ever
had any use for your old man,

969
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,171
kill the boys who done him in.

970
00:53:22,172 --> 00:53:24,294
"Murder, darn foul," he called it.

971
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:25,195
What?

972
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:28,720
Now, now, old boy, he was
merely quoting Shakespeare,

973
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:29,796
don't you know?

974
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:31,232
Well, if this guy Shakespeare's in it,

975
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:32,580
then let's get him, too.

976
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:34,991
Yes, we, huh?

977
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:36,246
- Corbett's here.
- Alone?

978
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,975
No, the whole shootin'
match is with him.

979
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:40,132
Oh, get out.

980
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,287
And see it doesn't become
a real shooting match,

981
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:43,672
not in my place.

982
00:53:43,673 --> 00:53:45,006
See you later.

983
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:47,717
Well, Bennett,

984
00:53:47,718 --> 00:53:50,435
looks like we got saddled
with a bunch of fools.

985
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,417
Seriously, Tom, what are we gonna do?

986
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:56,751
Take it easy, I'll think of something.

987
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:04,534
(melancholic music)

988
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,842
Stumpy.

989
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:11,981
[Stumpy] Yes, sir.

990
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,422
You know, it's too
bad that you haven't got

991
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:15,876
the body to match your brains.

992
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:19,120
I'm so sorry sir, but
I feel I must withdraw

993
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:21,475
even the little I've had to contribute.

994
00:54:21,476 --> 00:54:22,745
What do you mean?

995
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:24,755
I've been trying to
tell you all day, sir.

996
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:26,408
I received a letter from England.

997
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:29,573
The family has squared
things with the authorities,

998
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:30,741
I can go home.

999
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,530
How soon do you expect to leave?

1000
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:39,793
In the morning, sir.

1001
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:42,910
I shall accompany Marshal
Masters and his prisoner to Juno,

1002
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:45,258
and go home from there.

1003
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:47,061
There, I've been putting
my papers in order

1004
00:54:47,062 --> 00:54:49,250
to make it easier for my successor.

1005
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:54,077
Will you just sign those
sir, and (mumbles).

1006
00:54:54,078 --> 00:54:55,844
How much of a family have you got?

1007
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,850
Oh, I've got an old mother,

1008
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:00,024
an older brother and three sisters.

1009
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:04,126
The youngest is about 18,
and they're all lovely,

1010
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:05,182
every one of them.

1011
00:55:05,183 --> 00:55:08,161
And they're fond of me too, in spite of,

1012
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,652
in spite of everything.

1013
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:11,756
Excuse me running on like this sir but,

1014
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:14,175
you can imagine how anxious
I am to see 'em all.

1015
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:15,759
I understand you.

1016
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,923
Stumpy, have you got any money?

1017
00:55:21,878 --> 00:55:25,269
Just enough for my
passage, but I don't care.

1018
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,838
But you should care.

1019
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:28,587
Man coming from the
gold country, you know,

1020
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:31,253
people expect gold
pouring out of his ears.

1021
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:34,455
Well, we, we can't
all strike it rich, sir.

1022
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,123
Oh, but you could.

1023
00:55:38,844 --> 00:55:40,440
What did you say, sir?

1024
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,015
You heard me right.

1025
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:46,099
You may take home as much as $10,000.

1026
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,802
10,000...

1027
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:54,171
Uh, no sir, I'm a very poor shot, sir.

1028
00:55:54,172 --> 00:55:58,394
(laughing) No, I don't
expect you to kill anybody.

1029
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:01,728
Sit down here, I'll tell you what to do.

1030
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:06,498
(lively music)

1031
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,527
[Pete] Come on Nick, let's
have a little service here.

1032
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:15,258
Hey, you're havin' quite a
party, ain't you Postmaster?

1033
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:16,532
Yep, farewell party.

1034
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:17,880
Young Corbett man's leavin' for Juno,

1035
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:18,714
first thing in the morning.

1036
00:56:18,715 --> 00:56:21,011
I'll be back before you know
it, you old snow bear, you.

1037
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:23,065
You're sure they won't
convict you of that murder, huh?

1038
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:24,310
[Man] They won't convict him of nothin'

1039
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:25,806
when they hear what he knows.

1040
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:26,845
[Nick] What'll it be, boys?

1041
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:27,832
Little rum and gum, please.

1042
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,408
- Whiskey for me.
- Bourbon.

1043
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:31,151
I wish I could be in Juno
when the judge gets a load

1044
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:32,563
of what Gary's got to tell.

1045
00:56:32,564 --> 00:56:34,814
(laughing)

1046
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,640
So you've got the evidence
you were lookin' for, Corbett?

1047
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,045
Enough, I think.

1048
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:42,040
Good, now you just hand it over to me

1049
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,699
and it'll make it official.

1050
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,035
Well, thanks Marshal but I,
I haven't written it down yet.

1051
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,325
I'm carrying it around in
my head for safe keeping.

1052
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:51,135
Would you have a little touch, Marshal?

1053
00:56:51,136 --> 00:56:52,469
Sure, bourbon.

1054
00:56:55,336 --> 00:56:57,171
Well, a safe return to you, son.

1055
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:58,089
Hurry back.

1056
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,429
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

1057
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,263
Sorry.

1058
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:05,758
(clattering)

1059
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,485
Why don't you leave me alone?

1060
00:57:07,486 --> 00:57:10,312
Now take it easy fella, I
think you've had a few too many.

1061
00:57:10,313 --> 00:57:12,991
That's an insult, take it back.

1062
00:57:12,992 --> 00:57:14,717
Hey, what's the matter with you, Stumpy?

1063
00:57:14,718 --> 00:57:15,934
[Gary] Man, you're loco.

1064
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,943
Take your hands off me.

1065
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:20,795
Are you gonna apologize or not?

1066
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,825
Well, I don't know what
there is to apologize for,

1067
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:24,338
but if you want it, you've got it.

1068
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:26,392
Well, you'll laugh at me, would ya?

1069
00:57:26,393 --> 00:57:28,345
You think I can't fight, huh?

1070
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:30,433
Well, (grunting).

1071
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:32,743
[Gary] Now, now, now, now, hold on.

1072
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:36,327
You better go someplace
and sleep this off.

1073
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,191
Who hit him?

1074
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:42,025
He did.

1075
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,706
He had it comin' to him.

1076
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:47,387
That's no excuse for
hitting a man like that.

1077
00:57:47,388 --> 00:57:50,835
Take the little fellow into my office.

1078
00:57:50,836 --> 00:57:54,507
(crowd chattering)

1079
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:57,417
Fine thing to hit a man like Stumpy.

1080
00:57:57,418 --> 00:58:01,603
(men talking, indistinct)

1081
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:04,187
Put him down here in the chair.

1082
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,107
He'll be all right.

1083
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,191
Yeah, it's only a bump.

1084
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,830
(suspenseful music)

1085
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:18,000
Well, what are you staring at?

1086
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,083
Nothing, boss.

1087
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:21,690
Corbett hit the poor
little Stumpy so hard

1088
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:24,430
that it killed him, understand?

1089
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:26,327
Now get out and spread the news.

1090
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,578
And don't let him get away.

1091
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:38,630
- Stumpy is dead, boys.
- What?

1092
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:40,391
That's right, he just
died in the office.

1093
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:41,306
[Man] What kind of a lug is it

1094
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:43,582
that would slug a man like Stumpy?

1095
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,895
(crowd talking excitedly)

1096
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:48,729
Boys!

1097
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,441
Boys, please, boys.

1098
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:53,025
Boys, you all knew poor Stumpy.

1099
00:58:54,455 --> 00:58:56,131
You know why this inoffensive little man

1100
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,132
was standing at the bar?

1101
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:03,558
He was celebratin', celebratin'
his last stay in Alaska,

1102
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:09,340
for tomorrow, he was goin'
home to his poor old mother.

1103
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,924
And now, he lies dead in there.

1104
00:59:14,396 --> 00:59:16,896
(men yelling)

1105
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:22,810
Stumpy's been killed, and
they say Gary Corbett did it.

1106
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:25,220
I don't believe it.

1107
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,353
What are they doing to him?

1108
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,521
Nothing yet.

1109
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:32,397
(crowd clamoring angrily)

1110
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:34,523
- Take it easy, take it easy.
- Give the man a chance.

1111
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,332
What chance did he
give poor little Stumpy?

1112
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,853
[Crowd] Yeah!

1113
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,213
[Man] I told you Stumpy started it.

1114
00:59:39,214 --> 00:59:40,198
You all saw it.

1115
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,262
[Man] Yes, he was drunk.

1116
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:42,629
[Man] That any excuse for murder?

1117
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,216
[Man] Why, Corbett's no murderer.

1118
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:46,056
[Man] No, why is the
marshal taking him to Juno,

1119
00:59:46,057 --> 00:59:47,124
for a tea party?

1120
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,375
[Crowd] Yeah!

1121
00:59:49,598 --> 00:59:52,431
(crowd clamoring)

1122
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,383
You've gotta stop this, Tom.

1123
00:59:58,384 --> 00:59:59,554
How can I?

1124
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,936
Well, you can't let them kill him.

1125
01:00:01,937 --> 01:00:03,497
Does it really mean that much to you?

1126
01:00:03,498 --> 01:00:04,748
Yes, it does.

1127
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:07,743
You made a deal.

1128
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:15,817
(crowd talking excitedly)

1129
01:00:15,818 --> 01:00:18,068
Men, will you listen to me.

1130
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:22,918
Stumpy was my employee,
but he was also my friend.

1131
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,625
And I assure you that I am
as interested as you are

1132
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,209
to see the murderer
punished for his crime.

1133
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,300
[Man In Crowd] Let's lynch him, boys!

1134
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:30,849
(crowd clamoring)

1135
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,570
Be quite.

1136
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,497
But there is no reason
why we shouldn't do this

1137
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,766
in a civilized manner.

1138
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:37,863
There's nothing
uncivilized about a hangin'.

1139
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,754
(crowd yelling)

1140
01:00:39,755 --> 01:00:41,088
Quiet, listen.

1141
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,676
We have law and order in this town,

1142
01:00:44,677 --> 01:00:47,106
and we are going to do
it in a legal manner,

1143
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:49,692
and after a proper trial.

1144
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:52,702
As judge of Moose River,
I order you to disperse.

1145
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:54,105
(crowd grumbling)

1146
01:00:54,106 --> 01:00:55,567
Quiet.

1147
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,397
Judge Bennett will take
charge of the prisoner,

1148
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:00,446
and he will be perfectly safe in our jail

1149
01:01:00,447 --> 01:01:03,380
till we can give him a fair trial.

1150
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:06,202
[Judge] Everything's
gonna be done (mumbles).

1151
01:01:06,203 --> 01:01:09,036
(crowd clamoring)

1152
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:12,608
Only gonna let them put
him in jail here, aye?

1153
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:13,913
No, might be a good idea for you.

1154
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:16,330
You'd be safer there than
you would in my custody.

1155
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:17,798
At least tonight, you will.

1156
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,940
This time, Marshal, he's my prisoner.

1157
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,882
[Man] I just wanna warn you, Judge,

1158
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:26,566
that jail better be
lynch-proof to catch on.

1159
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:28,390
I know you didn't do it, Gary.

1160
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:29,303
Thanks, Roxie.

1161
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,136
Come on.

1162
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:38,888
Tom.

1163
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:41,356
I wanna thank you what you've done.

1164
01:01:41,357 --> 01:01:42,190
I thought there's more than

1165
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:46,107
a mere polite thank you
involved, wasn't there?

1166
01:01:47,357 --> 01:01:49,921
I didn't understand you to mean...

1167
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,083
We made a deal.

1168
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:54,529
Your friend is safe in jail, isn't he?

1169
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,664
Yes.

1170
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:57,716
You think there's nothing to stop us?

1171
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,227
We can leave tonight.

1172
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:00,484
And don't pack.

1173
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:01,363
We can buy everything

1174
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:04,428
and anything you want in San Francisco.

1175
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,889
I see you expect me to keep

1176
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,228
my end of your deal.

1177
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:10,062
Well, look, come on.

1178
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:16,302
Fun idea.

1179
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:23,314
Just got some news for you.

1180
01:02:23,315 --> 01:02:24,148
Yes?

1181
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:25,020
Corbett's friends are planning

1182
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:26,946
to break him out of jail sometime tonight.

1183
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:27,980
You want us to (mumbles)?

1184
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:29,513
No, you are much too fidgety

1185
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:31,176
with your shooting arrows.

1186
01:02:31,177 --> 01:02:34,260
Besides, they will never get him out.

1187
01:02:35,343 --> 01:02:36,888
But suppose they do get him out?

1188
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,222
Don't worry, they won't.

1189
01:02:38,223 --> 01:02:40,125
And this time it's gonna be an accident.

1190
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:43,055
This time, it'd be done in jail.

1191
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:46,556
(mellow orchestral music)

1192
01:02:53,294 --> 01:02:55,711
(clattering)

1193
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:01,148
(soft, lively orchestral music)

1194
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:12,741
(fire crackling)

1195
01:03:17,183 --> 01:03:19,600
(bell tolls)

1196
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,680
- There's fire there.
- See it.

1197
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:32,639
[Man] Hey, where's the fire?

1198
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,139
(man talking, indistinct)

1199
01:03:37,968 --> 01:03:40,801
(crowd clamoring)

1200
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,419
Hey, somebody let us out!

1201
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,337
Let us out.

1202
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,351
The jail's on fire.

1203
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:05,626
(ominous music)
(clamoring)

1204
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:10,157
Hey, open up.

1205
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:13,172
(banging bars)
Let us out.

1206
01:04:13,173 --> 01:04:15,833
Hey, somebody open up.

1207
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:16,751
Let us out!

1208
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,147
[Roxie] Hey.

1209
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:26,043
Please, you gotta let him out of there.

1210
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:27,654
[Pete] I would, take it easy, darlin'.

1211
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,796
We're doing the best we can over there.

1212
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:31,964
But you can't go in there.

1213
01:04:32,888 --> 01:04:34,009
[Roxie] Why?

1214
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,010
Go help him!

1215
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:41,716
Who has the key to the cell?

1216
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:42,980
Here it is but...

1217
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:43,898
Let me have it.

1218
01:04:43,898 --> 01:04:44,731
John.

1219
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:46,612
John!

1220
01:04:47,894 --> 01:04:51,811
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1221
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:57,914
Help!

1222
01:04:58,749 --> 01:04:59,666
Let us out.

1223
01:05:08,332 --> 01:05:09,575
Hurry!

1224
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:10,409
Move it!

1225
01:05:12,315 --> 01:05:13,148
Move it!

1226
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:19,597
(fire crackling)

1227
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,751
Move it!

1228
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:25,561
Move it!

1229
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:31,123
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1230
01:05:33,741 --> 01:05:35,741
(thuds)

1231
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:10,536
(crowd clamoring)
(fire crackling)

1232
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:17,108
Gary, Gary, thank heaven, you're safe.

1233
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:19,359
(coughing)

1234
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:26,137
[Man] Men, don't stand there

1235
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:29,087
trying to save the jail (mumbles).

1236
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:31,255
Save the rest of the town.

1237
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,519
[Man] Get out, everybody get out.

1238
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,407
Fire spreading to this place.

1239
01:06:36,408 --> 01:06:40,158
Come on, get out.
(screaming)

1240
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:47,938
(fire crackling)
(crowd clamoring)

1241
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,405
(coughing)

1242
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,156
No, don't waste it.

1243
01:06:57,113 --> 01:07:00,686
I hope the devil's generous with his.

1244
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:03,300
I should like to be met with a drink.

1245
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:04,884
Don't talk, dear.

1246
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:09,565
Dear?

1247
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,228
It's been a long time.

1248
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,935
All my fault, I know.

1249
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:23,268
Now maybe I can answer
that old problem (coughs).

1250
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:26,448
To be or not to be,

1251
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,000
that is the question:

1252
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,950
whether 'tis nobler in the mind

1253
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:40,014
to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune,

1254
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,724
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

1255
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:51,512
and by opposing, end them.

1256
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,529
To die,

1257
01:07:58,787 --> 01:07:59,620
to sleep,

1258
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:02,347
no more.

1259
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:05,385
To sleep,

1260
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:09,517
perchance to dream.

1261
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:16,976
To dream.
(somber orchestral music)

1262
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:28,572
(suspenseful music)

1263
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:29,907
Gary, we just found out

1264
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:32,203
that Leroux's the man
behind this whole thing.

1265
01:08:32,204 --> 01:08:33,652
The court clerk (mumbles) back of the jail

1266
01:08:33,653 --> 01:08:35,029
made him talk.

1267
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:36,669
Leroux?

1268
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:39,711
Let him go, he can find his own debts.

1269
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:42,462
(fire crackling)

1270
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:49,291
(crowd clamoring)

1271
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:54,947
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1272
01:09:02,294 --> 01:09:04,058
I'm certainly glad that you got out.

1273
01:09:04,059 --> 01:09:06,474
I was smoked out by your friends.

1274
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,558
My friends?

1275
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,232
I don't understand what you mean.

1276
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:11,268
Leroux, I want you to tell me

1277
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:12,315
who was with you in this scheme

1278
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:14,328
of robbery and murder.

1279
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:16,113
Not really.

1280
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:16,970
I suppose the next thing,

1281
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:18,117
you're going to ask me to sit down

1282
01:09:18,118 --> 01:09:21,728
and write you a letter
about it, (mumbles).

1283
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:24,457
What's strong and Leroux, who are they?

1284
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,388
(gun fires)
(clattering)

1285
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:30,556
(punching)
(thuds)

1286
01:09:38,363 --> 01:09:40,613
(punching)

1287
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:50,446
(clattering)

1288
01:10:10,095 --> 01:10:12,512
(clattering)

1289
01:10:16,556 --> 01:10:18,806
(punching)

1290
01:10:28,793 --> 01:10:32,960
(clattering)
(thuds)

1291
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:48,241
(clattering)

1292
01:10:57,523 --> 01:10:59,773
(punching)

1293
01:11:10,444 --> 01:11:12,861
(clattering)

1294
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:26,239
(punching)
(thuds)

1295
01:11:28,488 --> 01:11:29,534
No, don't.

1296
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,653
Why, are you going to talk?

1297
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:32,044
All right, I'll talk.

1298
01:11:32,045 --> 01:11:33,589
Well, go ahead.

1299
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,435
I'm not the head man.

1300
01:11:35,436 --> 01:11:37,119
I'm only telling you.

1301
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,440
- I told...
- For whom?

1302
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:40,671
You may yet find out.

1303
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:42,755
(firing)

1304
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,222
Thanks, Marshal.

1305
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,310
I wasn't in trouble.

1306
01:11:50,311 --> 01:11:51,478
You are now.

1307
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:55,988
He meant you?

1308
01:11:55,989 --> 01:11:56,822
Well, you didn't think

1309
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:58,309
that he had brains enough to organize

1310
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,072
a plan, did you?

1311
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:03,239
A very good plan, if I do say so myself.

1312
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,791
But he only fronted for me until,

1313
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:09,459
like you, he fell in
love and lost his head.

1314
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,981
Speaking of losing heads,

1315
01:12:13,982 --> 01:12:17,002
I'm sorry I have to blow your resolve.

1316
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:20,126
I won't let you suffer, I'll aim through.

1317
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,745
I like you, Corbett.

1318
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:23,329
Oh, before I die,

1319
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:26,414
there are a few things I'd like to know.

1320
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:27,665
Say it, mate.

1321
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:31,240
Make it quick.

1322
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:33,481
Tom, if you're behind all this,

1323
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,799
why did you bother to arrest me?

1324
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,096
Why didn't you just snuff me out?

1325
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:38,680
That's a fair question.

1326
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,112
I'll answer it, really.

1327
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:42,722
Meanwhile, pack the gold dust

1328
01:12:42,723 --> 01:12:45,223
in that leather pouch, for me.

1329
01:12:48,674 --> 01:12:52,841
(people clamoring)
(fire crackling)

1330
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,678
I let you live for the same reason

1331
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,745
I took those handcuffs off.

1332
01:12:58,746 --> 01:13:00,158
I wanted to find out just what evidence

1333
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,534
you could collect.

1334
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:03,924
I was gonna get it all
from you on the trail

1335
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:07,201
after a little accident I planned for you.

1336
01:13:07,202 --> 01:13:08,435
But when you told me that the evidence

1337
01:13:08,436 --> 01:13:11,024
was not in your pocket, but in the head,

1338
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:13,199
that put me on the spot, Corbett.

1339
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,083
I had to find some other way

1340
01:13:14,084 --> 01:13:16,435
to get the truth out of you.

1341
01:13:16,436 --> 01:13:18,256
This fool upset everything

1342
01:13:18,257 --> 01:13:20,152
by being too impatient.

1343
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:21,408
He wanted his share now,

1344
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:23,546
so he had to die.

1345
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:24,582
Sorry, Corbett.

1346
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:28,856
(firing)
(thuds, clattering)

1347
01:13:28,857 --> 01:13:30,665
Get up quick, Marshal.

1348
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:33,658
It's gonna get a little warm in here.

1349
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,492
Finish our little chat

1350
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,075
if you were gonna join with us.

1351
01:13:39,805 --> 01:13:42,555
(fire crackling)

1352
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:49,312
(tranquil orchestral music)

1353
01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:59,383
How would you kids like
to go (mumbles) of Frisco

1354
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:03,494
when we get there and
have dinner with me, huh?

1355
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:06,078
You know, I guess you wouldn't.

1356
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:09,176
Imagine, he has a gold mine in Alaska

1357
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:11,337
and they gotta go all
the way to San Francisco

1358
01:14:11,338 --> 01:14:15,428
to dig up a little gold band for a finger.

1359
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:17,559
Beautiful any day.

1360
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,773
Kinda hate to leave it

1361
01:14:18,774 --> 01:14:23,449
for a crowded little town
like Washington, D.C.

1362
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,867
but they sent me to congress.

1363
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:28,263
Well, leave.

1364
01:14:29,657 --> 01:14:31,343
And I've got something to tell

1365
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:34,457
those congressmen in the whole country.

1366
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,805
I'm going to make them see that gold

1367
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,445
is not the only important thing in Alaska.

1368
01:14:40,446 --> 01:14:42,692
Gold is just a decoy.

1369
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:44,068
Come on.

1370
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:45,671
Old dame nature's way of getting

1371
01:14:45,672 --> 01:14:48,455
the right kind of people here;

1372
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:52,278
rugged, solid people like Gary here,

1373
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:55,850
men who'll change the whole fate of Alaska

1374
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:59,240
and fill it into pig sty for the plague.

1375
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:01,302
They can't stop a stake.

1376
01:15:01,303 --> 01:15:03,108
We're America.

1377
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:06,609
(mellow orchestral music)
