1
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,624
That was tough, the coronary ostia were
damaged too. Well done, professor !

2
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,832
- Thank you, Fratta.
- I was wondering...

3
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,290
maybe next time,
under your supervision...

4
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,790
if you want, I could...

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,624
- I don't want. Rosa ?
- Yes, professor ?

6
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,082
Have you found a spot
for the patient in the ICU ?

7
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,165
I'll do it now.

8
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,415
It shouldn't be me to remind you,
try to be more professional if you can.

9
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,957
- Well ?
- Line's busy.

10
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:54,290
Go ask in person, a good walk
could help you burn a few kilos.

11
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,915
How did it go, professor ?

12
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,915
It was a complex operation,
but a successful one.

13
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,749
The patient is still sedated,
but his heart's responding well.

14
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,665
Thanks, Professor De Luca,
you're a miracle worker.

15
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,624
Miracles don't exist,
I'm an excellent surgeon. Goodbye.

16
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,790
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

17
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,540
Xenia, can't you see
it's nearly empty ?

18
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,915
Mum, please, I'm watching
something important !

19
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,832
Sorry, Bianca.

20
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,290
You take this,
I'll take care of the wine.

21
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,457
Sorry, Carla,
but I haven't eaten all day.

22
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,582
- Help yourself.
- Really tasty though.

23
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,999
We have a new entry here !

24
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,749
That's right ! You noticed then ?

25
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,915
I adopted her last week.
This is Zinza, from Burkina Faso.

26
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,915
Poor thing, not only an orphan,
she's ugly too !

27
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,582
Dinner's in half an hour.

28
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,082
The Plain of Castelluccio
is so amazing.

29
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,915
So peaceful...

30
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,749
- And the lentils !
- Delicious !

31
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,374
- Carla ?
- No, no wine, you know I don't.

32
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,999
You feel at one with the Universe.
Have you ever been, Dad ?

33
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:49,124
- No.
- Take Mum, she'd love it there.

34
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,290
Andrea, how's it going
with the respiratory diseases ?

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,874
Pretty tough.

36
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,999
Tommaso, aren't you friends
with Professor Savarese ?

37
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,790
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,499
Do you want me to call him and say:
"My son hasn't studied

39
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,665
but pass him anyway
because we're friends" ?

40
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,415
We didn't bring them up
with those values.

41
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,207
I didn't mean it like that,
I meant...

42
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,040
Excuse me.

43
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,540
Andrea's very clever,
he'll make us proud.

44
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,582
Right, sweetie ?

45
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,874
Talking about being proud...

46
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,832
did you know Gianni
wrapped up a great sale today ?

47
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,540
Stop it !

48
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,582
- He'd like to...
- If he doesn't want to tell us...

49
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,874
Okay, I'll tell you.

50
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,082
100 square metres,
unauthorized veranda,

51
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,124
fourth floor, no elevator !

52
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,540
Hear that ?
Well done, my love.

53
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,332
I'll get it, Xenia !
Sorry, that's Furio. I have to go.

54
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,915
Drive carefully.

55
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,249
- Hello, Andrea.
- Hey, Furio !

56
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,207
- Have you told your parents yet ?
- Not yet.

57
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,540
Why not ?

58
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,707
Do Bianca and the wimp have to eat
here every night ?

59
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,957
- You know she can't cook.
- I've no idea what she can do !

60
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,915
Don't be like that !

61
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,499
I saw this documentary
about amoebas.

62
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:35,082
And some ofthem
are a lot more active than she is.

63
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,999
Listen, about Andrea...

64
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,915
what do you think ?

65
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,624
Why ?

66
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,540
What do you mean ?

67
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,374
I don't know, he's been odd lately.

68
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,457
He's always been peculiar.

69
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:53,457
As a kid he'd spend all day
counting ambulances going by !

70
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes, and we took him
to a neurologist.

71
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,915
What exactly do you mean...

72
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,165
by odd ?

73
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,165
Different.

74
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,624
Well, he's probably got a girlfriend.
Good for him ! !

75
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,207
Then why is he
with Furio every night ?

76
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,915
They get on well.

77
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,499
Precisely !

78
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,290
What do you mean ?

79
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,999
Let's see if you get it...

80
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,290
He's gay ?

81
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,415
I think so.

82
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,582
- Oh God ! Now what ?
- What ?

83
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,749
Are we still discriminating against
one's sexual orientation ? Come on !

84
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,124
No, of course not !

85
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,957
I totally agree with you.

86
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,040
It might sound like a clichÃ©...

87
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,457
but love is what counts.

88
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,707
You're a big softie then ?

89
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:58,540
Good night.

90
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,040
Rosa, can't you keep up ?
Go on a diet !

91
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,665
I won't operate you
if you have a heart attack.

92
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,665
Good morning !

93
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,790
- How are you feeling ?
- So and so.

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,957
- How did you sleep ?
- I was a bit breathless.

95
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,207
Did you expect to run
the New York marathon ?

96
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,540
Right.

97
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,374
Continue the treatment
and add 5 mg of Triatec.

98
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,249
- Goodbye.
- Professor, while you're here...

99
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,249
I've had this pain
for the last two days...

100
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,582
I'm sorry to hear that.

101
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,749
They think I'm their GP !

102
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,832
Did this have to happen right now...

103
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,999
with all the problems we already have ?

104
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,082
- Hello, Carla.
- Tommaso !

105
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,624
- He says he wants to talk to us.
- Who ?

106
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,290
Andrea ! He wants to make
an announcement to the family !

107
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,999
This is it then.

108
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,749
- What shall we do ?
- We have to keep calm. Where is he ?

109
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,624
In his bedroom.
He's waiting for you to get back.

110
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,374
- Bianca and the wretch ?
- At home, they don't know anything.

111
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,249
We'll have to warn them, so they won't
say anything that might hurt him.

112
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,624
- Will you do it ?
- Okay.

113
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,665
Is dinner ready ?

114
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,582
So I just wanted to warn you,

115
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,165
because tonight Andrea's probably
going to tell us he's gay.

116
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,082
Tommaso, I'm so sorry.

117
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,082
What are you doing ?

118
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,790
What's he doing ?

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,249
I don't know what to say,
that's terrible news.

120
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,790
No, it's wonderful news !
There's nothing wrong with it.

121
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,165
You're right, but I wouldn't
take it so well.

122
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,540
Dad's right, it's good news.

123
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,457
Dolce and Gabbana's parents
probably weren't happy at first...

124
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,540
- But they made them so proud !
- Bianca, it's an illness !

125
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,124
I know, but there are advantages
of being sick !

126
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,749
Like Dustin Hoffman in that film,
he's a spastic but a genius at cards.

127
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,165
- "The Graduate" ?
- No !

128
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,582
- "Tootsie" ?
- No, come on !

129
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,124
And that short, handsome actor
who's a Jehovah's witness.

130
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,540
- Are you sure I've seen it ?
- That's enough !

131
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,499
Let's go in there now...

132
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:47,165
and when Andrea makes
his announcement, we'll hug him

133
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,207
and say:
"We're all with you." Okay ?

134
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,415
- "Rain Man".
- That's the one !

135
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,165
I'd like Xenia to be here too.

136
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,332
Xenia's cooking artichokes...

137
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,790
That's no problem, Carla.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,707
If Andrea wants
Xenia to be here too...

139
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,332
In fact, it's only right. After
all these years, she's family too.

140
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,624
- What's up ?
- Come here, Xenia.

141
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,165
Andrea's got something important
to tell us.

142
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,915
Forgive me, I'm a little nervous,
it's hard to find the words.

143
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,874
Darling, everyone here loves you.
Right ?

144
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,124
- Right.
- Hell yeah.

145
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,915
- I hope I won't disappoint you.
- You won't !

146
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,332
Love is all that matters,
as Dad says.

147
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,999
Let's hear him out, Carla !

148
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,040
You're right, Mum.
Love is all that matters.

149
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,457
And my decision
was guided by love.

150
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,332
I have lived a meaningless life
for so long.

151
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,332
I felt I lacked something
and thought: "What's wrong with me ?

152
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,707
Why am I so unhappy ?"

153
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,249
Then one day I met someone
who gave meaning to everything.

154
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,624
And this person is Jesus.

155
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,124
I've decided to become a priest.

156
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,290
I'll go and peel the artichokes.

157
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,790
What do you think, Dad ?

158
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,832
What do I think ?

159
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,415
I'm think that if you're happy...

160
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,040
Dad's happy for you.

161
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,249
What about you, Mum ?

162
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,957
Mum is too, very.

163
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,457
Do we still give him a hug ?

164
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,749
We're all with you.

165
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,082
We're all with you

166
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,915
I have to go now.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

167
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,457
Of course.

168
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,332
But thanks again...

169
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,207
I love you all.

170
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,249
Better than what we thought...

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,374
No !

172
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,582
Are you crazy ?

173
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,040
My son, a priest ?
You must be joking !

174
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,915
God doesn't exist...

175
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,165
and even if he did...

176
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,457
which I sincerely doubt...

177
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,832
why throw your life away
being a priest ?

178
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,499
It's an anachronistic profession,
it's like being a chimney sweep !

179
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,624
A knife grinder !

180
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,165
A bagpipe player !

181
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,332
I don't want a son
who's a bagpipe player !

182
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,665
- Calm down, Tommaso...
- But what with calm down, Tommaso ?

183
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,874
We're talking about
the Catholic Church here !

184
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,457
The most obscurantist institution
that ever existed

185
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,457
on the face ofthe Earth.

186
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,124
Anyhow but the Vatican owns
the best real estate.

187
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,374
Enough.

188
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,082
I'm going to bed.

189
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,832
Dad, wait !
What about the artichokes ?

190
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,415
Good night !

191
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,040
- Xenia ?
- Yes, professor ?

192
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,374
Do you call this an ironed shirt ?

193
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,624
- Is that a trick question ?
- Listen, Xenia...

194
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,415
I've always respected you,

195
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,249
and I've always said that
what Pizarro did to the Incas

196
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,540
was one of the bleakest hours
of history.

197
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,332
But I'm a stickler
for well-ironed shirts. Thank you.

198
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,040
I wouldn't have any coffee
if I were you.

199
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,665
- Carla, we have to do something.
- What ?

200
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,707
I don't know.
Do you want your son to be a priest ?

201
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,999
- If it's what he wants.
- It's madness.

202
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,540
Then tell him.

203
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,915
What if he thinks
I don't like the idea ?

204
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,249
- Why, do you like it ?
- You don't get it !

205
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:42,707
I can't force him to change his mind,
I have to do it gradually.

206
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,874
I have to make him see reason.

207
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,915
- You talk to him.
- Me ?

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,374
I'm always at work,
you have nothing to do.

209
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,415
- Do it when you come home from work.
- No, no, no !

210
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,290
You talk to him.

211
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,499
Instead of adopting other people's
kids, look after your own.

212
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,957
I've had enough,
three years and not one incision !

213
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,707
When will I learn ?
That's enough !

214
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,915
I'll give him a piece of my mind
next time I see him !

215
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,249
Rosa !

216
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,874
Good morning, professor !

217
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,165
Sorry, professor.

218
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,957
Go on, stuff yourself !

219
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,790
When you've finished
guzzling carbohydrates,

220
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,082
bring me Mazzanti's case sheet.

221
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,499
Yes, professor.

222
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,790
Another thing: I don't want
to see her on my ward again.

223
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,540
She provides the patients
with spiritual help !

224
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,957
Don't talk heresy, the patients
have all the help they need.

225
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,415
Is that clear ? I don't want
her around when I'm here.

226
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,832
I'm curious about something,
you become a priest... then what ?

227
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,290
What do you mean ?

228
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,874
I mean, do you go freelance...

229
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,249
do you open your own parish...

230
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,874
Let's say it's more
like a franchising.

231
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,749
Sorry, I'm not well informed
about church business.

232
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,124
Maybe you could explain it to me...

233
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,915
Dad says I never look
into things properly.

234
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,415
You can start by reading
the Gospels.

235
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,832
The Gospel.
There's only one.

236
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,165
No, there are four.

237
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,790
Give me one,
I don't want to overdo it.

238
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,832
- May I ?
- Come in, Mum.

239
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,207
How's everything ?

240
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,040
Much better now.

241
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,832
- Do you feel like talking ?
- Of course.

242
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,165
You gave us some wonderful news...

243
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,540
but we weren't expecting it,
you do realize that ?

244
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,165
Mum, I'm happy.

245
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,999
I can't explain it, but I've finally
found the right path in life.

246
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,707
It's terrible not to have a purpose,
I don't know how you do it.

247
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,374
- Me ?
- Yes.

248
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,832
I've seen you, Mum.
I feel sorry for you.

249
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,165
You pretend to be happy and carefree
but you're depressed.

250
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,415
You're always alone,
doing pointless things.

251
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,415
It's as though
you've given up trying.

252
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,999
Have I hurt you ?

253
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,832
Don't be silly, of course not !

254
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,832
<<The Gospel According to St. Matthew.>>

255
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,374
<<Chapter 1: the book>>

256
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,249
<<of the generation of Jesus Christ...>>

257
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,457
<<the son of David, the son of Abraham.>>

258
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,415
<<Abraham begat Isaac,>>

259
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,624
<<and Isaac begat Jacob,>>

260
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,832
<<and Jacob begat Judas>>
<<and his brethren.>>

261
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,124
<<And Judas begat Phares...>>

262
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,749
<<and Zara ofThamar>>

263
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,165
<<and Phares begat Esrom,>>

264
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,082
<<and Esrom begat Aram,>>

265
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,415
<<and Aram begat Amina...>>

266
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,790
<<..dab,>>
<<Aminadab begat Naasson...>>

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,749
Bertocchi, I can't talk right now.
I'm with someone.

268
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,040
I'll call you back. Thank you.

269
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,040
Well ?

270
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,290
Have you been drinking ?

271
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,082
No !

272
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,540
Did you talk to Andrea ?

273
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,082
Tommaso, my life has no meaning.

274
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,332
<<Jechonias begat Salathiel,>>

275
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,124
<<and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,>>

276
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,374
<<and Zorobabel begat Abiud,>>

277
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,540
<<and Abiud begat Eliakim,>>

278
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,624
<<and Eliakim begat Azor,>>

279
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,915
<<and Azor begat Sadoc,>>

280
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,540
<<and Sadoc begat Achim...>>

281
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,832
"All the ends of the earth
will remember.

282
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,999
And all the families of the Gentiles
will adore in his sight,

283
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,874
for the kingdom belongs to the Lord,
and he will have dominion,

284
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,040
in his sight they will fall down,
all those who descend to the ground."

285
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,749
- What is it, Dad ? Be quick !
- I need to talk to you.

286
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,832
- You know your brother...
- Andrea ?

287
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,457
You've only got one !
Focus, Bianca !

288
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,290
I need your help.
Do you know what's going on ?

289
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,624
Right now ?

290
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,790
I've downloaded "Jesus of Nazareth",
it's so exciting !

291
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,165
- Zeffirelli's film ?
- Don't tell me how it ends !

292
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,749
Why are you watching it ?

293
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,540
Andrea lent me the Gospels,
but I couldn't get into it.

294
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,499
Sorry, they're leading him to Pilate.
Come on !

295
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,665
Oh God, poor thing !

296
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,374
- Good morning.
- Hello, how can I help you ?

297
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,832
Tommaso, how nice to see you !

298
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,790
I'll take care ofthis.

299
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,874
Come here !

300
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,374
You'd never guess
but she has a degree in Psychology.

301
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,582
Yes, I got that impression.

302
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,665
I'm glad you've come by.
At last !

303
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,374
Would you like a coffee,
tea, cocktail snack...

304
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,499
No, nothing, thanks.

305
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,124
Listen, Gianni,
I'll get straight to the point.

306
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,249
Over the years you may have
thought that I despised you.

307
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,249
- No !
- And you'd be right !

308
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,832
But I've got a problem,
and I don't know who to turn to.

309
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,957
Tommaso, I'm here to help,
anything you need, you know...

310
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,415
It's Andrea.

311
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,707
This vocation of his makes no sense.

312
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,457
I think he's just a bit confused.

313
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,957
I don't know what to do.

314
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,165
Let's go over everything...

315
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,999
In the past has Andrea...

316
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:33,582
ever shown any interest
in religious matters, like the Pope ?

317
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,749
Padre Pio ?

318
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,457
The Nativity scene ?

319
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,165
- Nuns ?
- No, never.

320
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,499
So it's a recent thing. I reckon
he's keeping bad company.

321
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,415
Do you know
what Andrea does at night ?

322
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,749
Where he goes ?

323
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,790
Who he hangs out with ?

324
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,040
<<The life cycle of this dust mite>>
<<is rather unusual.>>

325
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,707
Tommaso, you and I need to talk.

326
00:22:58,916 --> 00:22:59,915
Go ahead !

327
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,582
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I've not been happy lately.

328
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,249
Can we turn the TV off, please ?

329
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,165
Tell me.

330
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,332
The other day I realized
I cannot carry on this way.

331
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,915
I'm going out, bye !

332
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,457
Bye, Andrea.

333
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,999
The kids have grown up,

334
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,374
you have your work, which you love,
but what do I have ?

335
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,124
It's as though no one's interested
in what I do or say !

336
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,499
I'm ready !

337
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,832
That's enough !

338
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:19,415
Enough, or I'll get big-headed
and want to be Pope !

339
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,790
Right, last time we got to

340
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,874
the multiplication
of the loaves and fishes.

341
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,915
Location: the splendid
Lake Tiberias.

342
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:33,457
Cast: you know the leading man,
he never changes, Jesus,

343
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,999
the disciples,
and a crowd of people,

344
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,582
but not ordinary people,
people of every kind,

345
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,082
mutilated, crippled, blind, paralytic,
in short, a funny crowd.

346
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,499
And they were hungry to boot !

347
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,874
And Jesus said: "Let's feed them,
we can't let them go hungry."

348
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,749
But the disciples were
embarrassed and said:

349
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:58,040
"All we have left are five loaves
and two fishes.

350
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,624
If we'd known before,
we'd have gone for grocery !"

351
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,207
What a cool priest !

352
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:07,082
So Jesus said: "That's no problem,
leave it to me."

353
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,582
What can I tell you ?

354
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,624
There's not much difference
between us and those wretches.

355
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,790
Think about it,
we are lacking something too.

356
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,749
Maybe not an arm or a leg...

357
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:02,374
but sometimes it's worse
not to have any hope or dreams.

358
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:06,957
So, if you are hungry
like those poor wretches,

359
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,457
then take my advice...

360
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,457
give Jesus a try.

361
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,915
Taste his words,
the way my friend Andrea did.

362
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,999
And you will realize
you'll want for nothing.

363
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,457
It's late, I need some sleep.

364
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,165
See you next time.
Bye, and thanks.

365
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,832
I don't like this Father Pietro.

366
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,290
The way he moves and talks...
he's like a guru.

367
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,124
And he's brainwashed my son.

368
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,124
Find something out,
then I can talk to Andrea

369
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,832
and put a stop to it.

370
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,707
The police chief is a friend of mine,
but I don't want to ask him.

371
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,499
Don't worry, Tommaso.

372
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,915
Pizzuti is a very discreet person.

373
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,457
I can vouch for him,
he's worked for me for years.

374
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,749
Bankruptcies, repossessions...
a real sleuth.

375
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,999
I'm just doing my job.

376
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,999
Forgive me, it's an important call.

377
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,415
Dr. Finocchiaro, good morning !

378
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,749
How is Mr. Lucci ?

379
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,040
BARE OWNERSHIP SALES

380
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,915
What ? Much better ?

381
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,290
He was on his deathbed yesterday !

382
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,999
You're puzzled about it too....

383
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:29,332
All right, doctor. Keep me posted.

384
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,790
The age is right. Fingers crossed.

385
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,332
Where were we ?

386
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,124
What's up ? Are you crazy ?

387
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:47,124
I was thinking about our happy
memories in the last ten years.

388
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,790
- And ?
- I couldn't think of a single one !

389
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,999
You've ruined my life !

390
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,249
What's happened ?

391
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,957
He doesn't know !
He never does.

392
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,457
What is there to know ?

393
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,290
You are a selfish and horrible man !

394
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,957
I was a fantastic person
when we met.

395
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,499
- Look what you've done to me !
- Will you calm down, please ?

396
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:11,874
Yes, we mustn't lose face.
That's all that matters to you !

397
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,874
You've become so middle class !

398
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,665
Worse than those people
we despised when we were 20 !

399
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,207
I don't want to stay
with a man like that.

400
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,332
Enough !

401
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,957
- What are you doing ?
- Leave me alone.

402
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,415
- Where are you going ?
- To live in Xenia's room.

403
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,832
Professor, please make up,
it's a very tiny room.

404
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,332
Well ?

405
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,332
You were right. Fr. Pietro
is a very shady character.

406
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,332
Did you find something out ?

407
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,499
Not here.

408
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,207
Not bad, eh ?

409
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,999
Explain them to me.

410
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,915
Look at this.

411
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,457
What do you see ?

412
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,082
- He's posting a letter.
- That's right.

413
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,665
But the question is: who to ?

414
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:52,999
Who to ?

415
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,915
I don't know yet,
but it seems a good lead.

416
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,249
And this one ?

417
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,624
Have you ever seen a priest
using a cashpoint ?

418
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,290
I haven't.

419
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,165
This is the most interesting one.

420
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:12,499
You may say: "So what ?
He's going into a pharmacy."

421
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,457
But you can buy
a lot in a pharmacy.

422
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,499
Medicine, shampoo, but also...

423
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,915
syringes !

424
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,790
- Get out of here, Pizzuti !
- But we're getting somewhere...

425
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,999
- Get out !
- Let me explain...

426
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,290
Out !

427
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,915
Could you give me an advance ?
I'm broke...

428
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,957
Out !

429
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,749
- Photogenic, isn't he ?
- Is that him ?

430
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,624
That's him, that's him !

431
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:15,124
"Pietro Pellegrini,
several charges of robbery,

432
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,540
scams and aggravated fraud.

433
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,332
He discovered the faith
through the prison chaplain.

434
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:23,915
He went straight to the seminary
when he left jail.

435
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,290
Why are you interested
in this priest ?

436
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,040
It's a long story,
I'll tell you some other time.

437
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,582
Stefania and I are having
a house warming on Saturday.

438
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,082
- Tell Carla, we'll see you there.
- Yes.

439
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:38,749
Isn't it strange that a
man like him would drop everything

440
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,249
and become a priest ?

441
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,415
Yes, it is strange, but until
proved otherwise he's clean.

442
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,249
Yes, until proved otherwise...

443
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,207
Thank you.

444
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,957
Sorry for the late notice
but I'm going away tomorrow.

445
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,915
For two weeks.

446
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,374
- Where are you going ?
- Camaldoli Hermitage.

447
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,415
A retreat for young men
who want to be priests.

448
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,082
I thought you had an exam next week ?

449
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,832
Yes, Dad...

450
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,124
but seeing I can't do both things,

451
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,582
I've been thinking
of dropping out of med school.

452
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,457
- What's wrong ?
- Dad !

453
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:27,207
- Darling !
- Tommaso, look at the little birdie !

454
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,332
Look at the birdie !

455
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,999
Have a sip, Dad.

456
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,832
I'm okay now.
Don't worry.

457
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,874
No one was worried.

458
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:44,874
Andrea, what's this hermitage like ?
Like a holiday farm ?

459
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:49,790
- No, it's a monastery !
- Great ! I'd love to go there.

460
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,707
Let's go one weekend.

461
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,290
- Do they have wifi ?
- I don't know.

462
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,082
Fr. Pietro's organized it,
he's a priest friend.

463
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,999
A very special person.

464
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,332
- Really ?
- Yes, he helps everyone.

465
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,665
Whatever problem you have,
financial, family, he'll help you !

466
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,749
That's nice !

467
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,374
I'm very fond of him.

468
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,499
It's thanks to him
I found my vocation.

469
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,582
Come in, Dad.

470
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,040
Listen, Andrea...

471
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,290
we haven't discussed
this matter yet...

472
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:32,749
but I think it's time I told you
what I think of your vocation.

473
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,665
I already know.

474
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,082
- You do ?
- Yes.

475
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,457
I am so happy to have your support.

476
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,290
I was afraid you wouldn't approve,
but you've been great.

477
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,290
As usual !

478
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,624
I feel like crying.

479
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,124
That makes two of us.

480
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,582
<<For the sake>>
<<of His sorrowful passion...>>

481
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:59,249
<<Have mercy on us,>>
<<and on the whole world.>>

482
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,374
<<For his sorrowful passion...>>

483
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:05,082
<<Have mercy on us>>
<<and on the whole world.>>

484
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,540
Darling, I'll go and get a glass...

485
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,290
Well, how did it go ?

486
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,165
Terrible.

487
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,999
I have to make the most
ofthese next two weeks

488
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,707
to prove that this priest
is a rogue.

489
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,207
- How will you do that ?
- I don't know.

490
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,332
I need an idea.

491
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,332
Shall I call Pizzuti ?

492
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,415
Was that a no ?

493
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,707
That evening, when Jesus finished
praying, he went to his disciples

494
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:56,207
and they... they were fast asleep !

495
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,415
You're laughing because you think
we're better than them.

496
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,290
But we're not.
We think we are awake

497
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,457
because we eat, work, chat, and
fill our lives with pointless things.

498
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,457
But the truth is we are sleeping too.

499
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,082
And we don't realize it.

500
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:18,082
But we'll discuss that next week.
Go to bed now, good night.

501
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,999
Thanks.

502
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,290
- Fr. Pietro ?
- Yes ?

503
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,082
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed...

504
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:43,457
- Bye, Fr. Pietro !
- Later. Say hello to Cesarone.

505
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,582
- You were saying ?
- Forgive me...

506
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:49,540
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed,
I have problems at home...

507
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,499
- I have a retarded brother...
- How are you, professor ?

508
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,040
- I'll be right back.
- Do you come here too ?

509
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:59,207
Fratta, you don't know me,
you've never seen me, okay ?

510
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:02,415
- But, professor...
- If you tell anyone...

511
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,749
I'll have you kicked out
of the hospital, so be warned.

512
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,040
- Okay.
- Have a good evening.

513
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,707
Having problems ?

514
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,374
No, no.

515
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,499
Yes !

516
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,457
Yes, lots of them.

517
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,582
I'm desperate, I'm unemployed,

518
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,790
I support my retarded brother,

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,124
my wife had a nervous breakdown
and beats me.

520
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,332
- Nothing else ?
- I want to kill myself.

521
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:42,540
- I'm not surprised.
- I need some spiritual solace.

522
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,540
I want us to get to know
each other better.

523
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,999
What's your name ?

524
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,207
You can't even remember ?

525
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,790
It's with all these problems...
Mauro !

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,999
Mauro, go and get some sleep,
it's late !

527
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,082
- I said I want to kill myself.
- Right now ?

528
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,374
- No...
- No !

529
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:08,790
Okay, come and see me tomorrow,
we'll have a chat.

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,082
Via del Crepaccio, 12.

531
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,415
See ya !

532
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,624
- Sorry, did it hit you ?
- No...

533
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,749
This is the church
my mother used to come to.

534
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,957
I lived nearby when I was a kid,
so I'm doing it up,

535
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,457
bit by bit,
when I'm not in my parish.

536
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,457
- Can you paint ?
- No.

537
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,374
Too bad, you could've
given me a hand.

538
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,249
What was your name again ?

539
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,207
Mauro !

540
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,915
You need to take
something for your memory !

541
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,999
You worry me.

542
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,790
- How are you feeling today ?
- Bad.

543
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,165
Terrible.

544
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,207
It's getting worse.
I think of suicide every day.

545
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:43,499
Don't, life is not yours,
you can't do as you like !

546
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,457
I know, but I'm broke.

547
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,874
I don't know where to turn,
I'm willing to do anything.

548
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,624
Even steal.

549
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,124
What do you say ?

550
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,582
What can I say ?

551
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,874
I'm desperate...
what would you do if you were me ?

552
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,790
Just a sec.

553
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,374
Federico !

554
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,290
Darn it... Never mind,
we'll meet Saturday.

555
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,665
Remember the clams !

556
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,957
Bye, buddy.

557
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:32,124
But you don't look that desperate,
that suit must be worth 1,200.

558
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,415
This ?

559
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:38,582
No, it's second-hand.
I got it from charity.

560
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,540
Good, that chair's still wet !

561
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:51,457
- Want a bite ? It's good.
- No, thanks.

562
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,290
How long have you been a priest ?

563
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,415
Ten years, late-onset vocation.

564
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:02,707
- What's it like being a priest ?
- Working on Sundays sucks...

565
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,915
I'm just kidding !

566
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,999
How come you know
how much this suit costs ?

567
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:15,040
I used to like smart clothes once...

568
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,165
- What did you do before ?
- Lots of things.

569
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,999
- For example ?
- Various jobs...

570
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,499
- Such as ?
- Are you a cop ?

571
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,999
Me ? Of course not !

572
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,957
All right...

573
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,457
I don't remember seeing you
at the meetings.

574
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,332
- Have you been coming long ?
- No.

575
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,415
No, it was my first time.

576
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,749
- They spoke so highly of you...
- Who did ?

577
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,832
Never mind.

578
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:46,582
You don't even remember
your own name...

579
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:50,540
- Are you a believer though ?
- Yes ! Very much so !

580
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,874
Then take my advice and pray.

581
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,374
It's essential to pray,
you must never tire of praying.

582
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,582
- Are you busy right now ?
- No.

583
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:02,874
- Let's go and pray together.
- Don't you have to paint the church ?

584
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,707
Don't worry, I'll do it later.
Come on !

585
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,499
Darn it...

586
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:15,540
Next week we want to organize
a joint meeting...

587
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,249
with representatives
of some high schools

588
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:22,832
to prepare a report to send
to the Ministry of Education.

589
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,415
I'll let you know.

590
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,999
But now we have the solidarity
of a former student.

591
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,040
I'll let her speak.

592
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,957
Thank you.

593
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,415
Hello, everyone, my name's Carla.

594
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:40,040
It feels strange to be back
in this school

595
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,332
after all these years.

596
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,999
My children attended
this school too...

597
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,707
or rather one ofthem,
the other chose a different school...

598
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,290
Okay then...

599
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,874
I am here today
to express my solidarity

600
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,540
and support,

601
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,457
but also to give you
some heartfelt advice.

602
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,707
Student collectives are fine,
so are meetings,

603
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,332
and joint reports, but they are
sometimes not enough.

604
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,207
Because there are people
who just won't listen.

605
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:13,624
If you think someone's interested
in you for what you are,

606
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,040
and what you have inside,
you're wrong.

607
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,582
No one's listening to you,
they don't care.

608
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,832
It's as though you don't exist.

609
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:24,207
So show them you exist,
but do it now,

610
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:27,915
because soon it will be too late,
and you'll regret it all your life.

611
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,999
No more talk, let's take action !

612
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,124
Let's occupy !

613
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,915
Rosa, that's mine.
See who it is.

614
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,999
Hurry up.

615
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,832
It says "priest".

616
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,665
Come closer.

617
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,582
Hello ?

618
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:02,874
Come straight here,
Via delle Sette Chiese, 101.

619
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,249
<<I can't right now, I'm busy.>>

620
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,540
Knock it off,
you've got nothing to do.

621
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,082
<<Are you there ?>>

622
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,165
<<- What's going on ?>>
- Found you a little job.

623
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,207
What kind ?

624
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:21,999
A friend of mine wants someone bright.
You said you'd do anything...

625
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,832
<<- Yes.>>
- Well ?

626
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,165
I'm coming.

627
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,457
Fratta, I have to go.
Can you take over here ?

628
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,499
Me ?

629
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,874
Remember to replace the valve,

630
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,582
or the patient won't survive
the operation.

631
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,415
Good luck !

632
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,874
Fr. Pietro ?

633
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,749
- About time !
- I waited ages for the bus.

634
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:57,124
Said doesn't trust people he doesn't
know, but I persuaded him.

635
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,249
But don't show me up.

636
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,665
By the way, are you
any good with a knife ?

637
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,999
Not too bad, why ?

638
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,874
- Who's next ?
- Me.

639
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,790
Two euros with potatoes.

640
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,665
- Two euros precisely ?
- Two euros.

641
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,082
Have faith, Said.

642
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,415
Does he think
he's performing surgery ?

643
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,665
79 !

644
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,040
Can I have a piece with mushrooms ?

645
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,499
Not the edge,
it's always a bit burnt.

646
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:02,749
And not the middle,
it doesn't look very cooked,

647
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,332
I'll get indigestion.

648
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,290
No, I'll have it
with courgettes instead.

649
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,415
I hope you've put more salt
in it today.

650
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,499
What are you doing ?

651
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,707
Cheese and tomato will be fine.

652
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:19,374
Here's the knife, cut your own.

653
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,374
I ask a friend for a favour,

654
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,749
I find you a job,
which isn't easy right now,

655
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,790
and you walk out ?

656
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,249
I know, but there was
an emergency at home...

657
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,915
Pietro !

658
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,790
Take a walk, I'm busy.

659
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,499
Hello, Fr. Pietro.

660
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:46,040
- Got the money ?
- Yes, but I wanted to ask...

661
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,499
- Hand it over !
- Why are you so aggressive ?

662
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,874
- You do this every week !
- Wait.

663
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:54,624
- What is it ?
- I didn't get as much this week.

664
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,999
Make this last all week.

665
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,832
- Go now.
- This ?

666
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,624
Go home, take my advice.

667
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,749
- Who was that ?
- A friend.

668
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,332
- What did he want ?
- What do you care ?

669
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,124
I was just curious.

670
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:23,082
- What happened at home ?
- An emergency. You know how it is.

671
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,332
Burnt out wife, retarded brother...

672
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,874
Yes, I wouldn't have turned down
that job otherwise.

673
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,124
You can't carry on like this.

674
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,415
I know, so tell me what I should do.

675
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,415
Tell me !

676
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,915
Okay, I tell you what...

677
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,790
I'll come to your place on Friday
and meet them.

678
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,915
- To my home ?
- Yes. What's your address ?

679
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,624
What did you say ?

680
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,249
That I'd send him a text
when I remembered.

681
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:52,040
Brilliant !

682
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,374
I couldn't invite him
to my penthouse in Prati.

683
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:58,540
Can you find me a dreary,
dingy apartment ?

684
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,957
It's not easy,
I deal in luxury real estate.

685
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,290
Does it have to be very dingy ?

686
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,957
Absolutely.

687
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,540
Then my place is perfect.

688
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,749
Tommaso, forgive me.
It is worth all this trouble ?

689
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,790
For your own sake,

690
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,290
you're a well-known surgeon,
what if people find out ?

691
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,665
This criminal has brainwashed
my son !

692
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:25,124
And it's all a cover.
He's got this money racket going.

693
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,082
I need to show my son
he's a rogue.

694
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,332
We'll use Pizzuti's home,

695
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:36,082
you can be my retarded brother,
that shouldn't be too hard...

696
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,707
- I could be a handicapped relative.
- No need.

697
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,999
Your secretary can be my wife.

698
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,832
Patrizia, who's not here right now...

699
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:48,040
- She's in a clinic.
- I'm sorry about that. An accident ?

700
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,999
- No, liposuction on her buttocks.
- Darn it !

701
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,540
- It's a routine op.
- Who cares !

702
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,165
Where will I find another wife ?

703
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,707
- There's no sugar in it.
- No, drink it.

704
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:09,707
I don't want to interrupt
your coffee break.

705
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,540
I said drink it !

706
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,499
Listen, Rosa, I need to ask you
a little favor.

707
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,874
- For friendship's sake.
- Yes, professor.

708
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:24,665
I can't explain it
to you right now,

709
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,499
but I will clarify everything later.

710
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,957
On Friday afternoon,
for a couple of hours,

711
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:33,540
I want you to pretend
to be my wife.

712
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,790
What do you mean ?

713
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,915
I... how can I ?

714
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,207
No, I don't feel up to it.

715
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:42,249
What must I do ?

716
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:45,624
I've told you,
pretend to be my wife.

717
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,374
But be a little aggressive.

718
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,874
In fact, to be honest,
you have to ill-treat me.

719
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,999
What time are we meeting ?

720
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,290
- Where are you going, Dad ?
- I have to go out.

721
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,749
Andrea will be back
from his retreat soon.

722
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:07,624
It would be nice if we were all here
for a family prayer.

723
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:11,165
- Do it with your mother.
- She's at the student's union.

724
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,749
Where ? No, never mind.

725
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,290
Come on, Dad, stay here !

726
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,624
We'll recite the rosary
while we wait !

727
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,457
- What's with the dead smell ?
- Quiet !

728
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,665
- And you live here, Pizzuti ?
- Yes.

729
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,124
Well, I'm staying with
my ex-wife right now.

730
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:03,457
A small problem with the courts,
but it'll be sorted out soon.

731
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,040
This way.

732
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,665
What did I tell you ?
It's perfect !

733
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:17,374
It's a bit stuffy,
let's open the windows...

734
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,582
We'd better not.

735
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,124
You know how it is, the neighbours...

736
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,082
People can be mean.

737
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:26,665
Rosa, there are some teacups
over there.

738
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:31,540
I'll grab a couple of shirts
and underpants before I go.

739
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:39,165
Tommaso, I've been working
on the retarded brother act.

740
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:50,499
- I have another version too...
- No, the first one's fine.

741
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,707
Rosa, understand
what you have to do ?

742
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:55,915
- Yes, professor.
- No, don't call me that !

743
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:59,332
Today I'm Mauro, your husband
and you have to ill-treat me.

744
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:02,374
- I'll try, but I'm not sure I...
- You have to !

745
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,999
I'll be off.
Here are the keys.

746
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,374
Thanks, Pizzuti, you're the best.

747
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,874
You're welcome.

748
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,790
- Who's that now ?
- Probably the municipal police !

749
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,207
My damn neighbour must've called them.

750
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:21,457
- It's okay, it's Fr. Pietro.
- What will you do now ?

751
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,082
Open it, don't worry.
Leave it to me.

752
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,290
What are you doing ?

753
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,457
- May I ?
- Fr. Pietro !

754
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,290
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

755
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,499
Let me introduce my family.

756
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,082
- This is my wife Rosa.
- Hello.

757
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,915
My brother Gianni.

758
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,374
Yes.

759
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,082
And this is...

760
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,790
- Pizzuti ! His brother-in-law.
- Nice to meet you.

761
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,124
A little floral gift, madam.

762
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:05,082
Thank you ! Look and learn !
This asshole never buys me presents !

763
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,374
This way, everyone.

764
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,332
Let's sit down.

765
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,207
How are you, Gianni ?

766
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,624
Fine ! How long
has he been like this ?

767
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:31,832
- He was born that way.
- But he's improved lately.

768
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,624
- Biscuit ?
- No, thanks.

769
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,165
Yes, all he thinks about
is eating, the pig !

770
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,290
Easy, violence doesn't pay.

771
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,374
Sorry, I got worked up.

772
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,540
Isn't Gianni drinking ?

773
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,332
I'll help him. Drink up, dear boy.

774
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,832
It's a little hot.

775
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:01,790
- Am I doing okay, professor ?
- Yes, maybe just a little less...

776
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:06,790
I'm very happy to be here
with you today.

777
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,749
Mauro has told me all about you,
I know times are hard,

778
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:14,707
but Mauro's a good man and with
God's help we'll find him a job.

779
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:17,832
Ajob !? He's a lazy asshole...

780
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,790
Madam, no...

781
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:26,707
Mauro, you were right,
you're in deep trouble.

782
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:30,624
Listen, Pietro, I'll tell you again...

783
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:34,040
if you've anything that needs doing,
even if it's illegal...

784
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,457
- Not again ! I'm a priest !
- I know that...

785
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,249
but how many priests... you know ?

786
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,874
What ? Go and have a rest,
you're tired.

787
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:46,540
I have to go now,
but do me a favour...

788
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,624
- When you feel down, and desperate...
- Pray.

789
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,874
No, call me, any time you want.
I'm here for you.

790
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,790
You must never lose hope.

791
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,207
All right.

792
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,165
Bye.

793
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,790
Is Andrea in his room ?

794
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:18,874
Thanks.

795
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:24,790
- Welcome back !
- Hi.

796
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,790
- I've missed you.
- Me too.

797
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,290
Dad, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

798
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,082
This is the famous Fr. Pietro.

799
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:41,665
- This is my father, Tommaso.
- Hello.

800
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,999
You look more like a Mauro to me.

801
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:52,999
- I don't get it...
- Fr. Pietro likes to joke.

802
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:55,624
- So does your father.
- No, Dad's serious.

803
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:59,249
- He's a famous heart surgeon.
- So he earns a fortune.

804
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,332
Even doctors are struggling.

805
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,040
Dad, can I finish talking
to Fr. Pietro ?

806
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,332
Of course.

807
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:09,540
I have a lot of things
to tell Andrea, too.

808
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,582
- You can tell him next time maybe.
- No !

809
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,040
Go, you're a busy heart surgeon !

810
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,040
- Beverages ?
- No.

811
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,082
- Soft drink ?
- I'll get it.

812
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,540
Go on !

813
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,790
- I'll see to it.
- Thanks.

814
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:31,499
Tommaso, I need your help now.

815
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:35,707
I don't know what to do about Bianca.
She's really into Catholicism.

816
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:39,415
She insists we can't have sex
if it's not for procreation purposes.

817
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,040
Can you imagine ?

818
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,457
What shall I do ?
It's a physical necessity for me !

819
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,082
Perhaps you could talk to her.

820
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,832
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

821
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,999
Will you talk to her ?
Was that a yes ?

822
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,957
Nice house !

823
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,874
Aren't you feeling well ?

824
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:10,165
What a view !
All of Rome at your feet.

825
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:18,790
- What did you tell Andrea ?
- Nothing, I can keep a secret.

826
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,207
Professional ethics.

827
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,749
Thank you.

828
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,124
But I want you to tell me something...

829
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,040
Why ?

830
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,790
Because it's inadmissible

831
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,499
that my son, who has a brilliant
medical career ahead of him,

832
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:40,457
should throw it all away
for something that doesn't exist,

833
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,082
just because someone
has brainwashed him.

834
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,499
- I've brainwashed him ?
- Yes !

835
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:49,999
Before he met you,
Andrea never wanted to be a priest.

836
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:53,124
- How do you know ?
- He's easily influenced.

837
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,540
He's a child !

838
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,790
- You've often influenced him !
- I'm his father, I'm allowed to.

839
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,624
Yes ! And for once when Andrea
makes up his own mind,

840
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:07,040
his father disappears and Mauro
and all his problems appear.

841
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,374
All right...

842
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,249
I apologize for tricking you.

843
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,749
Sorry.

844
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,457
Good man.

845
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,749
Repentance is praiseworthy.

846
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,207
But not enough.

847
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:26,415
In confession, first we have
repentance, then penance.

848
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,124
How many Hail Marys ?

849
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,915
No, that's too easy !

850
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:31,957
What do you mean ?

851
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:36,415
You know all the restoration work
at the church ? I need a volunteer.

852
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:40,624
You must be joking.

853
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:42,207
No.

854
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,915
- You can forget it.
- That's too bad.

855
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,290
What will Andrea think
when he finds out his father,

856
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,915
the intelligent, democratic,
and tolerant man he praises to me...

857
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,582
is actually a hypocrite ?

858
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,457
You get the idea !

859
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,582
You will help me out
for a whole month.

860
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,290
Then you can go your own way.

861
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,457
Right, I'll count to three,
we'll lift it up

862
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,665
and hang it up there.

863
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:10,040
One, two...

864
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,999
Why not call
one of your fanatic followers ?

865
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,249
We can manage, come on !

866
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,624
One, two...

867
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,874
I'll pay for it to get done,
consider it a donation.

868
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:24,374
You priests are good at taking
money... everyone knows that.

869
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,499
One, two...

870
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:34,082
It annoys me on a symbolic level.

871
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:38,415
So are you trying to say
you're too old for this ?

872
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:40,749
One...

873
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,040
two...

874
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,499
Easy now, one step at a time.

875
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,374
Lift your feet up,
it won't hurt as much.

876
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:52,207
- Try tilting your pelvis.
- Oh please...

877
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,999
It helps, trust me.

878
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,874
Slowly now.

879
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,707
Rest, deep breath.

880
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,040
Wait !

881
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,082
- Sorry...
- Is that better ?

882
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,749
- No.
- Good, come on !

883
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:06,249
A few steps more...
It's more a psychological pain.

884
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:10,790
What ? This is a disc hernia.
L-4, L-5, I know !

885
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,290
Okay, now concentrate,
this is the hard bit.

886
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,874
Try and lean forward
and I'll push you in.

887
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:21,249
- Don't push me.
- Slowly does it, from behind.

888
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:24,374
Rotate your hip...
There we go !

889
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:27,332
You should be happy
to have this pain.

890
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:30,707
It means the Lord
is putting you to the test.

891
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:32,665
Go fuck...

892
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,082
Bye-bye.

893
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,040
What's up ?

894
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:03,999
I don't see why you're doing this,
you already have a parish.

895
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:07,749
I'm doing it for my mother,
I caused her so much sorrow.

896
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,082
- If she could see me as a priest...
- But where do I fit in ?

897
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,790
It's for your sake too.

898
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,374
In fact, you should be thanking me...

899
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,040
Listen, priest...

900
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,665
I don't have to thank anyone.

901
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:31,165
While you pretend to save people
with your prayers,

902
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:32,832
blessings and incense...

903
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,040
I really do save people !

904
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,415
And they thank me for it,
every day !

905
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,915
Is that clear ?

906
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,249
What a nasty temper !

907
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,707
But remember,

908
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:57,040
even if you do save people,
you are still a human being.

909
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,832
Perhaps you thought you were God,
but you're not, sorry.

910
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,374
Death comes
when you least expect it,

911
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,665
"like a thief in the night"
as Saint Paul put it.

912
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,832
Have you read his Letters ?

913
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,082
Read his First Letter
to the Corinthians.

914
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,290
- Give me a break.
- "For who regards you as superior ?

915
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,249
What do you have
that wasn't given to you ?"

916
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:23,540
<<This morning there were violent>>
<<clashes in the centre of Rome>>

917
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,499
<<during a student demonstration.>>

918
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,707
I didn't have any palpitations
last night.

919
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:34,124
Perhaps I'm getting better,
doctor.

920
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,540
I don't believe it !

921
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,749
No !
It's a tragedy !

922
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,874
Where are you going ?

923
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:49,124
Tell me the truth, am I dying ?

924
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,457
Thank you, darling.

925
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:08,832
- Carla, we need to talk.
- I have nothing to say to you.

926
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:13,624
- We can't carry on like this.
- Gianni's finding me a place.

927
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:15,707
Now get out.

928
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,457
- Listen, Carla...
- Get out !

929
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,249
What is it, Tommaso ?

930
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,540
- Nothing.
- You look miserable.

931
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,499
- Is anything wrong ?
- No, not at all.

932
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:46,832
I'm here for you.

933
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:54,207
Listen, seeing you're here,
why don't you talk to Andrea ?

934
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:57,582
- He's not cut out to be a priest.
- I don't agree with you.

935
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:01,499
I think it's the right job for him,
he's smart, he'll go far.

936
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:04,207
- Wouldn't you like a bishop son ?
- Pietro, please !

937
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:05,790
It's well paid !

938
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,582
Fr. Pietro !

939
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,457
Hold this.

940
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,457
- What do you want ?
- I've brought you the money.

941
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,499
- Hurry up then.
- Here.

942
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,499
- Just this once.
- Thanks.

943
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,040
- Be good.
- I love you.

944
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,332
- Say hi to your wife for me.
- I will. Bye.

945
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,915
Let's go and clean the brushes.

946
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,707
That's Mimmo, a decent guy
but obsessed with video poker.

947
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:43,749
So I mind his wage and give
him some money now and then.

948
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,790
Give me back my pizza.

949
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,665
Professor, can you sign
Mrs. Mariani's discharge ?

950
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,582
Thank you.

951
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:08,040
- What have I done ?
- Have you changed your hairstyle ?

952
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,374
Yes. I shouldn't have ?

953
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:11,790
It suits you.

954
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:13,749
Thank you.

955
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:27,124
- Is Andrea not here ?
- He's at the priest's meeting.

956
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,249
By the way, that business
about Bianca and Catholicism...

957
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,249
It's okay now,
she's into the Orient now.

958
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:40,332
She saw some tantra videos
on Youtube, and...

959
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:44,124
Tommaso, our sex life
has really taken off again,

960
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,415
we're going whole hog !

961
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,957
Please, I'm eating !

962
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:50,624
So ?

963
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,624
No luck, she says she's not hungry.

964
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:01,915
I'm worried, she's getting
more and more depressed.

965
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,915
Don't worry, you know
what she's like.

966
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,457
Why, do you know
what she's like, Dad ?

967
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:12,665
You don't, or she wouldn't
be in this state now.

968
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,707
Come on, Bianca, eat up !

969
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:19,332
He thinks he knows everything !

970
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,082
With that air of superiority,
always judging people.

971
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,707
Because he's the best !
No way...

972
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,749
All we needed was you
spouting this rubbish !

973
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,665
Of course, I'm stupid !

974
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:33,415
You've always thought that,
but you had Andrea to make up for it.

975
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:36,707
You've always despised me, Dad.

976
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,249
You've always despised us both.

977
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:42,749
My husband might not be a genius
or the most handsome

978
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:46,624
but at least he never judges me
the way you have,

979
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,624
ever since I was a child.

980
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,874
And I have always tried
not to let you down.

981
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,082
I remember when I was a child,

982
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:58,165
you would force me to listen to
Guccini, De Gregori, De AndrÃ© !

983
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,915
Making a 7-year-old
listen to De AndrÃ©...

984
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,790
is really mean !

985
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,582
In fact, I want to tell you
something else

986
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:10,707
that will really hurt you.

987
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:13,040
I like Gigi D'Alessio !

988
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,374
Yes, you heard me !
Because he's great, he moves me,

989
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,207
makes me feel better !

990
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,999
I'm going home.

991
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,082
What's come over her ?

992
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,040
Tommaso, forgive me...

993
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:37,790
Good night.

994
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,540
At the Saviour's command

995
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,249
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:

996
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,999
Our Father who art in heaven,

997
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,999
hallowed be thy name,

998
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:03,999
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

999
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,999
on earth, as it is in heaven.

1000
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,207
Looking for me in church now ?

1001
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,874
What's wrong, Tommaso ?

1002
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,082
Nothing, what could be wrong ?

1003
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,457
Do you never feel lonely ?

1004
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:26,415
No, never, because
I am never on my own.

1005
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,165
And neither are you, because of...

1006
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,457
Not your imaginary friend again !

1007
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:37,957
Come with me.

1008
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:19,082
When I'm feeling down,
I come here.

1009
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,290
I discovered this place
one morning, many years ago,

1010
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,707
after I was released from jail.

1011
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,499
Yes, I've been in jail.

1012
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:32,082
And not just once !
There's lots you don't know about me !

1013
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:35,082
I might tell you one day.

1014
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,415
We're friends now.

1015
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:43,582
I didn't know what to do,
so I sat here.

1016
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,540
- And what did you think about ?
- Nothing...

1017
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,415
Nothing at all.

1018
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,540
I was on my own here.

1019
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:55,832
No desires, no expectations,
no fears.

1020
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,665
Just this.

1021
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:02,957
Then suddenly,
in a fraction of a second

1022
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,082
it all became clear.

1023
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:11,165
Three days later I entered
the seminary, and here I am.

1024
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:16,832
Between you and me, do you
really believe there is a God ?

1025
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,082
- Who do you think God is ?
- I don't know, you're the expert.

1026
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,790
You know those hot summer mornings
when it's really stuffy,

1027
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,582
you open a window
and cool air caresses your face ?

1028
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,582
- That's a breeze.
- No, it's God.

1029
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,832
And when the clouds
take on those strange shapes,

1030
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,415
a horse, a face, a carrot...

1031
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,082
and you keep staring at them...

1032
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:41,582
- That too is God.
- Who's in church then ?

1033
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,624
Do you think God is happy
to be cooped up in one place ?

1034
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,040
It's not enough, is it ?

1035
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,624
See that pear ?

1036
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,707
Inevitably,
that pear will fall one day.

1037
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,707
Bet you think it's due to gravity.

1038
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,374
No, it's God !

1039
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,749
You're starting to get the idea.

1040
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,082
- Darling, what's wrong ?
- I don't know.

1041
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:22,957
- I'm always tired.
- You're okay, don't worry.

1042
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,040
- Let me feel your pulse.
- What are you doing ?

1043
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:34,082
Slight tachycardia.
Let me look at your eye.

1044
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:36,124
Keep still !

1045
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,707
Nothing serious, don't worry.

1046
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:44,665
But go to the pharmacy...

1047
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,749
and ask for these tablets.

1048
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:52,915
Take three a day after meals
for a week.

1049
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,540
And just to be on the safe side,

1050
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,374
have a full check-up done,
okay ?

1051
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:01,999
Here.

1052
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:05,999
- Do you want some more pizza ?
- If you insist.

1053
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:09,040
- Boy !
- Here I am !

1054
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,874
- Two more cheese slices.
- Coming up.

1055
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:14,374
Said, two cheese slices.
Come on !

1056
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:17,374
The service is rubbish,
but the pizza's good.

1057
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,999
<<Back to the news in half an hour.>>

1058
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:11,624
<<I'll leave you with the lyrics>>
<<and music of Gigi D'Alessio !>>

1059
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,790
I was about to call you.

1060
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,624
Have a seat.

1061
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,290
- A drop of wine ?
- No.

1062
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,749
Just a sip.

1063
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,665
Try it.

1064
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,665
I made it,
it was one of your favourites.

1065
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,332
How is it ?

1066
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:05,957
So so...

1067
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:14,874
What's with all this ?

1068
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,832
I wanted us to have an evening
all to ourselves.

1069
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,957
You're so beautiful, Carla.

1070
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:26,374
Tommaso, stop it,
you're scaring me.

1071
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,207
It's the truth.

1072
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,499
Are you courting me ?

1073
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:32,290
Perhaps.

1074
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:36,207
You've started taking
the antidepressants again.

1075
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:37,624
No.

1076
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:40,249
It's just an excuse really.

1077
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,790
I'm more interested in after dinner.

1078
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,749
I've finished then.

1079
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,582
Don't you want the main dish ?

1080
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,874
Pot roast cooked in Barolo wine.

1081
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:53,124
Did you make it ?

1082
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,290
I'd better not then.

1083
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,999
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- No.

1084
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,790
- What do you mean ?
- The month is up, you're free.

1085
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,249
We have to remove the stains
from the floors, move the pews...

1086
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:09,499
I'll take care of that,
you go home !

1087
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:13,332
- I won't see you again ?
- You can come to Mass on Sunday.

1088
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,832
Then I won't see you again !

1089
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:20,874
Watch out !

1090
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,124
Listen, let's grab a bite at Said's.

1091
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:28,749
- I have to work tonight.
- I can't, I have a meeting.

1092
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,374
But if you've nothing to do,
go and talk to Andrea.

1093
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,582
- About what ?
- You know what.

1094
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:38,582
If you're convinced it's not for him,
you have to tell him.

1095
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:43,082
I don't know
what to tell him anymore.

1096
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,082
Tell him whatever you want,
just talk to him.

1097
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:48,249
The time has come, right ?

1098
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:51,124
Look at this bougainvillea !

1099
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,999
Andrea ?

1100
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:08,290
Oh, I'm sorry !

1101
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,457
Dad !

1102
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:13,957
- Dad...
- It's okay.

1103
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:16,249
- No, let me explain.
- You don't need to.

1104
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,457
Yes, I do.
So much has happened recently.

1105
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:23,207
During the weeks
at the spiritual retreat...

1106
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,207
I started to have some doubts

1107
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,540
and I thought perhaps
I wasn't cut out for priesthood.

1108
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,290
I know I should have
told you before, but

1109
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,040
I was embarrassed
because I'd changed my mind.

1110
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:38,374
There's nothing wrong
with changing your mind.

1111
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:40,665
- I do it a lot myself.
- Is that so ?

1112
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,832
I thought you were the man
of absolute certainties.

1113
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:47,582
I thought that too.
But no...

1114
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,749
- So no priest for a son ?
- No !

1115
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:00,874
- Who's going to tell Fr. Pietro ?
- He already knows.

1116
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,415
- What ?
- I told him when he came here.

1117
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,415
So he's known all this time ?

1118
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,665
He convinced me to change paths
because I was too unsure.

1119
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,624
And then I met Alessia
at his meetings,

1120
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:18,499
the girl you...

1121
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:22,249
Okay, I have to go. We're going
to Fr. Pietro's meeting later.

1122
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,582
- Bye, Dad.
- Go on.

1123
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,790
The bastard !

1124
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,207
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

1125
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:17,707
How long will it be ?
I'm due at the hospital.

1126
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:20,207
- Five minutes.
- Good.

1127
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:22,332
I'll go and get changed.

1128
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:47,124
- Excuse me, professor.
- Yes.

1129
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:01,290
I got the CT scan results.

1130
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,874
- Well ?
- He has a frontal-parietal hematoma,

1131
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,915
with considerable shift.

1132
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:09,249
I have to operate immediately.

1133
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,707
De Luca, I'll be honest with you...

1134
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,832
it'd take a miracle.

1135
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,582
Do you want to observe ?

1136
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:43,957
Sandro, I have to go.
Will you look after the ward ?

1137
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:45,665
Of course.

1138
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,957
- Well, Dad ?
- The neurosurgeon's a friend of mine.

1139
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,415
He's very good,
he'll do all he can.

1140
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,249
But how is he ?

1141
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,499
Not well.

1142
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:24,582
He's not well.

1143
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,749
Call me when you get news.

1144
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:30,915
- Where are you going ?
- I have to do something.
