1
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,530
Are you fucking kidding me?

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:39,300
<i><font face=Candara size=17>{\an2}
<b>SubText: NoRMITA.326</b></font></i>

3
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,347
Whoever named this town <i>Downers Grove</i>

4
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,084
had a sick sense of humor.

5
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,900
The suburbs are the ghettos
of the meaningless...

6
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,409
unless your town has its very own curse,

7
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,741
where a senior dies each year
the week before graduation.

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,355
Now that suddenly gives your town
instant meaning.

9
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,478
You asked for it and more!

10
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,982
102.3.

11
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,586
A beautiful sunny day here in Illinois,

12
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,121
a whopping 88 degrees.

13
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,122
Summer around the bend.

14
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,318
Got a big shout out to all our seniors

15
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,156
at Downers Grove High School.

16
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,322
One week to graduation.
Make it count.

17
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,594
Don't get caught up in the curse.
Ha ha!

18
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,669
We're gonna keep playing all the hits.

19
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,397
Your hit music channel.

20
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,166
Only the best music.

21
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,974
Hey.

22
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,782
What's he doing?

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
Whoo!

24
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,184
Danny, come on!

25
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,829
Yeah, yeah!

26
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,342
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,347
It's the fucking curse.

28
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,785
It's only as few days before graduation,

29
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,444
and the curse hasn't happened yet.

30
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,723
Maybe it won't happen this year.

31
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,837
Maybe all the other accidents
are just a coincidence.

32
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,867
Hut!

33
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,736
At last year's sobfest, the class president
read a poem

34
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,604
that went something like...<i>Don't try
to understand everything</i>

35
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,745
<i>because some things don't make sense.</i>

36
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,014
But I can't help wondering
if the curse could be real.

37
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:11,767
The tall swarthy astronaut-type
is why mom dragged us here.

38
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,139
It's a bummer having a single mother
who's miserable.

39
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,805
So if astronaut-guy makes her happy,
astronaut-guy it is.

40
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,084
I mean, come out of the suffering

41
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,818
and problems that you face in life

42
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,726
brought on because of the choices
that you make.

43
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,096
You simply reap what you sow.

44
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,895
Whoa!

45
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,733
No one said a word about Rich
the whole way over,

46
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,272
and I..I would...

47
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,604
I would like your opinion.

48
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,110
Well, he isn't a meth addict.

49
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,805
Can I go now?

50
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,951
Sure.

51
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,947
Mom, I like him.

52
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,456
He seems nice, and I can tell
he really likes you.

53
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,630
I think he does. Thank you.

54
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,424
My angel.

55
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,625
I like him, too.

56
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,815
Who knows what Rich has on his filthy,

57
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,213
repressed religious mind.

58
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,135
Cut him some slack. He's
taking her to Vegas.

59
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,277
Be happy or fake it.

60
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,014
I checked his Match.com profile.

61
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,955
- He enjoys frisky women.
- I don't wanna hear this.

62
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,154
And one day hopes to host
his own reality show.

63
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,889
Let's hope for the best.

64
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,466
Okay, so you've got all the information.
We're at the...

65
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,466
Mandalay Bay and you'll be back Friday.

66
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,899
Okay.

67
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,971
I never left you alone before,

68
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,702
so please, please, please tell me
not to worry.

69
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,507
It is about that time the curse
of Downer's Grove rolls in.

70
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,172
Oh, my God. I didn't even think of that.

71
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,979
Mom, the curse is complete B.S.
We'll be fine.

72
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,315
Go. Have a good time.

73
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,821
Okay. God, I love you guys.

74
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,721
Oh, my angels!

75
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,986
Come here.

76
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,152
No drumming after 7:00.

77
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,159
Wish me luck. How do I look?

78
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,733
Is it okay?

79
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,371
Okay, Dave, you don't have
to hear this part.

80
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,029
I love you guys.

81
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,768
Okay?

82
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,050
Hey, Chrissie!

83
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,283
There's your stalker boyfriend.

84
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,890
Stop it.

85
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,232
- He's harmless.
- He totally likes you.

86
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,735
For the zillionth time,

87
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,075
her room's all pink and lace and shit.
Not your type.

88
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,718
Do you really think I'm interested
in her room?

89
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,478
What am I, an interior decorator?

90
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,486
You misread me completely sometimes.

91
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,387
Did I just pass your morn
and her new dude?

92
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,588
- For an older guy, he's not bad.
- I totally agree.

93
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,990
Drop it. Diner?

94
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,834
And you're looking exceptionally hot,
Tracy.

95
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,801
And you're looking exceptionally 15, Dave.

96
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,068
I think it's adorable that
you like me all the same.

97
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,145
Has she seen our Facebook page yet?

98
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,446
Uh, I don't think so.

99
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,420
I would've heard, so, no.

100
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,286
Cool.

101
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,691
I'll be jamming here later, if you
wanna hang or whatever.

102
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,311
Why are we going this way?
Diner's in the other direction.

103
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,010
I thought you might want to see
if grease boy was still working.

104
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,712
His name's Bobby.

105
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,356
What? How do you know?

106
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,889
Because I asked him.

107
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,617
When?

108
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,058
First semester, when the brakes
on my mom's car went,

109
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,630
I was sitting in the shop waiting,
and we got to talking.

110
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,198
Why didn't you tell me?

111
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,672
Oh. Oh, I see. You gave it up to him

112
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,741
in some hot steamy love pit out back,
didn't you?

113
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,741
You have to ask why I didn't tell you?

114
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,641
You guys have been at it like bunnies.

115
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,645
No. Nothing happened.
We're friends.

116
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,750
- With benefits?
- No.

117
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,647
Not even minimal benefits?

118
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,812
Not unless you count giving my mom
a discount a benefit.

119
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,322
So wait, hold on.
What's he like?

120
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,985
Actually, he defies the clichÃ©
of townie mechanic.

121
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,393
He's smart, ambitious.

122
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,194
He can reassemble an engine in a day.

123
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,894
Why would anyone want to do that?

124
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,032
Just drive.

125
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,881
That's his car.

126
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,575
Dude, that's a lime green
fucking muscle car.

127
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,584
So? I like that about him.
It's unique.

128
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,223
So you already broke the ice
and then some?

129
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,086
Ruthless withholder!

130
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,695
What am I supposed to do with
this battery in my backseat?

131
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,228
You lost me.

132
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,593
I was supposed to take it
to the recycling center,

133
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,132
but then I selflessly thought,

134
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,963
<i>Hey, wouldn't this be a nice opportunity</i>

135
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,399
<i>for Chrissie to meet her crush?</i>

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,439
<i>Ask him to help
with the battery...</i>

137
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,542
Apparently I'm out of the loop.

138
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,374
You gave it up to him

139
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,538
in some hot steamy love pit out back,
didn't you?

140
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,775
He's totally your first, isn't he?

141
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,580
You raging 'ho. Why the hell didn't you...

142
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,499
I bet it's gonna be Matt Goldberg
or James Rocchi.

143
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,337
I have a weird feeling.

144
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,479
Plus they're super secret Internet pervs

145
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,443
into underage shit that'd make you puke.

146
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,812
Total sinners and begging to be punished.

147
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,946
I bet Lauren Solomon.

148
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,149
Bitch.

149
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,022
What are you doing?

150
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,164
Trying to work out who's next.

151
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,493
Did you ever think maybe
there'll be no next?

152
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,295
After so many in a row?
There's gotta be a next.

153
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,528
Says who?

154
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,104
Well, the curse.

155
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,672
Oh, so you spoke to the curse?

156
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,706
Chrissie, ever since '04,

157
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,344
a senior's died right before graduation.

158
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,037
'05, Nina Golden drowned in the quarry.

159
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,309
'06, Scott Riley drove over the embankment
at Knoll's Hill.

160
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,146
Both of them were drunk, by the way.

161
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,949
2007, Jason Martin shot
in the liquor store.

162
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,616
2008, Myra Crawford, OD'd.

163
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,228
2009, '10, '11, '12.

164
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,195
Frank Esposito ripped in half
by the train.

165
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,494
Jennifer Licari, vanished.

166
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,659
Amy Mazur died in her sleep.

167
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,567
Keith Hardy, farming accident.

168
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,234
Last year, Michael Shaw, water tower.

169
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,572
We were there, Chrissie.
We saw it.

170
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,205
I saw a meth head choosing
to climb a water tower,

171
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,646
not a curse.

172
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,410
I have to go. I have a paper to finish.

173
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,215
You still have homework? We're
graduating on Saturday.

174
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,824
I'm late with my big report. Mr. Keller
gave me an extension.

175
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,017
I'm having a really hard time
concentrating.

176
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,559
Why? The curse?

177
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,255
Yeah. I mean, someone we know
is gonna die.

178
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,526
Look, we make choices.

179
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,762
Those choices produce results,
good or bad.

180
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,874
Climbing a water tower high?
Bad choice, bad result.

181
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,202
Going home to do your report

182
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,605
and forgetting all about this curse
so you can finish?

183
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,748
Good choice, good result.
See what I'm saying?

184
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,507
See you guys tomorrow.

185
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,706
Or maybe you won't.

186
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,546
Not funny, Chrissie.

187
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,245
She's right. Don't joke about it.

188
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,721
Lighten up.

189
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,087
Way to clear a room.

190
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,786
Look, I want to believe in a better place.

191
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,557
I remember all my Sunday School stories.

192
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,031
Woman who turned into salt, Noah's Ark,

193
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,534
the burning bush, the star in the east.

194
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,228
I just hope they're all true

195
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,534
and not a bunch of made-up stories
thrown into a book.

196
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,370
I mean, if there's a God,

197
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,137
why would he make my dad addicted to meth

198
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,077
so he could abandon a wife and two kids?

199
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,114
And why would he give
my 12-year-old cousin

200
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,253
incurable bone cancer?

201
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,785
These are just personal gripes.

202
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,889
I'm not even gonna to get into wars,

203
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,321
gas fucking ovens, ethnic cleansing,

204
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,121
random, meaningless violence and all that,

205
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,349
'cause we'd be here all night.

206
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,054
Wow.

207
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,063
That's hardcore deep shit, man.

208
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,498
I have a lot of stuff on my mind.

209
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,898
Way too much stuff.

210
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,060
What the fuck?

211
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,731
Cut the shit! Jesus!

212
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,934
What's your problem, guy?

213
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,080
Are you psychic?
My name is Guy.

214
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,647
- No shit.
- Yeah, shit.

215
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,684
We were wondering if you girls
wanted to join us

216
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,480
on a little adventure.

217
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,781
Maybe next time when you don't
scare the shit out of us.

218
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,418
You don't know who he is, do you?

219
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,084
Um, no.

220
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,196
Hi, pretty.

221
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,990
I'm Chuck. What's your name?

222
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,634
I'm Brittany, she's Courtney.

223
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,168
But we have to go.
Finals for college.

224
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,830
College? Really?

225
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,533
You guys look like maybe
you're still in high school.

226
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,645
And maybe you're worried about the curse.

227
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,214
We survived the curse.
We're at Northwestern.

228
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,782
Where do you go?

229
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,384
Willow Creek.

230
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,545
Chuck is our star QB. Do you guys
not read the paper?

231
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,452
He was our back-up junior year...

232
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,219
Hey, Guy, shut the fuck up.

233
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,953
Why don't you guys come to a party

234
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,155
over on our side of town?
It'll be fun.

235
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,833
No.

236
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,972
Hold, please, Chuck.

237
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,902
Please don't make me beg.

238
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,735
Willow Creek's in another county.

239
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,844
We'll do a drive-by.

240
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,675
If it's sketch, we'll get out of there,
okay?

241
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,544
Please.

242
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,343
- Chuck?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,148
It's a bad night. Maybe some other time.

244
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,985
What if I promise to have you home

245
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,423
before you turn into a pumpkin?

246
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,359
Scout's honor.

247
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,703
Let's not do anything stupid, okay?

248
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,860
When have I ever?

249
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,904
- Really want me to answer that?
- Yes!

250
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,703
Actually, no.

251
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,614
He's kinda cute.

252
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,952
You could totally make out with him.

253
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,492
I wouldn't say anything.

254
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,527
It would just be between you and me

255
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,255
and everyone else who's watching.

256
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,197
One, two, three.

257
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,133
Alright. Let's go find those boys.

258
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,276
I'll be there in a sec.
You'll be okay, right?

259
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,311
I'll be fine. Very fine.

260
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,665
Hey.

261
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,630
Hey, you.

262
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
It's good to see you.

263
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,065
I didn't think you were gonna come.

264
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,144
Yeah, me, too.

265
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,907
- You alright?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

266
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,012
Shh.

267
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,986
Whoa. Um...

268
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,528
I have to pee.

269
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,667
Sorry. I'm just gonna...just a sec.

270
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,454
Just a sec.

271
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,142
Hey.

272
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,211
What was that?

273
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,747
I had to go to the bathroom?

274
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,282
Relax, relax, relax.

275
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,485
Relax, relax, relax.
It's okay, it's okay.

276
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,823
- Um...
- It's okay. Shh...

277
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,127
Why are you freaking out?

278
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,633
- I'm not. I'm just...
- Shh...

279
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,609
- Um, Chuck, I feel like...
- It's okay. You feel like what?

280
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,677
I feel like I should probably
go find Tracy.

281
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,076
Make sure she's okay.

282
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,808
- She's fine.
- Chuck...

283
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,647
Hey. Whoa! Slow down.

284
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,484
Hey! Whoa! Chuck, come on, please?

285
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,189
Chuck, please?

286
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,487
- Please.
- Shh...

287
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,028
What the fuck is wrong with you?

288
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,290
I'm just...

289
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,763
What the fuck is wrong with you?

290
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,958
Please don't!

291
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,125
Stop it! Please!

292
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,033
Come on! Stop it!

293
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,800
- Wait till we finish.
- Get the fuck off me, Chuck.

294
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,806
This is it.

295
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,206
Hey!

296
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,973
Fuckin' finish it, bitch!

297
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,639
Fuck off me! Get off of me!

298
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,478
Get off!

299
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,888
Where's Chuck?

300
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,637
Are you okay?

301
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,636
What the fuck does it look like, you idiot?

302
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,404
Tracy? That guy Chuck tried
to fucking rape me.

303
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,810
Get out of there! It's not fucking safe!

304
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,188
Hey!

305
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,377
- Are you okay?
- Get us out of here.

306
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,524
Okay, so definitely not one
of my best ideas.

307
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,357
Do you think the curse
may be on one of us?

308
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,124
No.

309
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,361
I mean, one of us would be dead, right?
If it was on one of us.

310
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,925
Maybe it just, like, passed over us.

311
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,801
Shut the fuck up!

312
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:54,069
Okay. It's gonna be fine.

313
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,406
No, it's not gonna be fucking fine!

314
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,603
Why not?

315
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,716
Because I think I just poked
some fucking guy's eye out,

316
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,478
so it's so far from fucking fine!

317
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,088
We can never tell anyone about this, okay?

318
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,281
Okay.

319
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,126
We need a plan.

320
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,442
Shit.

321
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,771
God, if you do exist and can hear me,

322
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,460
please let this all be a bad dream.

323
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,440
Our friend seems to be awakening.

324
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,139
I...where...where is this?
Where am I?

325
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,341
Do not be alarmed, my friend.

326
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,884
My man Ivan found you in the crypt.

327
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,318
Shit.

328
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,692
Oh, God!

329
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,460
Fu...

330
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,837
Oh, shit.

331
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,474
Oh, God!

332
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,724
What are you doing?
Let me see your eye.

333
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,359
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?

334
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,017
- Can you see?
- No.

335
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,220
- What?
- No, I can't see!

336
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,728
You know what that does to your
fucking football career?

337
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,389
No, I don't know!

338
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,367
They won't even hire a fucking
one-eyed mascot!

339
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,064
I busted my ass for years to get you out
of this fucked-up town!

340
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,266
And now...

341
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,434
Damn it!

342
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,904
Someone we know is gonna die.

343
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,393
I've been dreaming about Indians

344
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,631
since I was a little girl.

345
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,072
Maybe it's because our town was built

346
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,941
on land that was stolen
from the Indians in 1832.

347
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,451
I can't help but wonder

348
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,587
if this has something to do
with the curse.

349
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,244
But if that were the case,

350
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,913
then all of America would be cursed.

351
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,253
Maybe we all are.

352
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,356
Stop it.

353
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,798
You're making connections
that aren't there.

354
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,493
There is no fucking curse,

355
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,434
God is elusive if he exists,

356
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,665
and you poked out some goon's eye
at a party

357
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,208
after he tried to rape you.

358
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,279
That's reality. Get out
of your head and deal.

359
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:57,211
What are you doing?

360
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,947
The acoustics in the basement
started to sound funk-defied.

361
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:03,355
It's five in the morning.
Everything sounds...

362
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,290
whatever it is you just said.

363
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,452
You came in last night like you
were in a wrestling match

364
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,121
with an engine.

365
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,292
You finally get into it
with that mechanic?

366
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,370
Hey, what is going on with you?

367
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,375
What happened last night?

368
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,636
Nothing.

369
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,178
Hey, hey.

370
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,043
When Dad was around and had his fits,

371
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,878
you always protected me and mom.

372
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,251
The least I can do is step up
and help when you need it.

373
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,914
Okay.

374
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,660
I don't even know where to start.

375
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,424
Ask me about last night.
Whatever you want.

376
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,999
Did Tracy say anything about me?

377
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,535
Dweeb.

378
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,503
I have other follow-ups.
That was just my lead-in.

379
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,137
What?

380
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,476
Did you give any of them your real name?

381
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,113
Hell, no.

382
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,709
What about your purse with your ID's?

383
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,215
Do you still have it?

384
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,148
Hell, yes. Good night.

385
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,788
It's already morning.

386
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,443
Sorry.

387
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,979
It's okay. I'm just jumpy.

388
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,913
You know, we've been friends
since we were in kindergarten,

389
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,179
and there's something weird
happening between us.

390
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,686
I can't take it anymore.

391
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,482
What do you mean?

392
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,956
You haven't answered my texts in weeks.
What did I do?

393
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,527
Nothing. I've just been really busy.

394
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,162
Is it the mechanic?

395
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,323
Are you keeping tabs on me?

396
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,869
Your brother is a fond of useful info,
and...

397
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,507
I happen to care a little bit.

398
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,644
- Come on. I'm parked near you.
- Alright.

399
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,176
I guess I have been avoiding you.

400
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,647
Why?

401
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,616
I don't wanna hurt you.

402
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,118
Hurt me from what?

403
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,349
You know, we went to prom,
and that happened.

404
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,617
It's just weird.

405
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,818
Because you laid a sloppy kiss on me?

406
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,294
We were drunk, and we kissed.
So what?

407
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,400
I don't want to lead you on.

408
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,469
Whoa. You thought I spun a drunken kiss

409
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,538
into some kind of potential relationship?

410
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,572
Really?

411
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,207
I'm such an idiot.

412
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,709
I can just erase it from my mind,
if you so wish.

413
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,482
Want me to...okay.

414
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,992
There you go. It's gone.

415
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,024
Come on.

416
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,563
Where are we going?

417
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,564
I don't remember what I was doing.

418
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,863
You and Monica Chase?
When did that happen?

419
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,030
Uh, recent, recent.
Very recent.

420
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,570
Sorry. You should wait here for a second.

421
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,614
What are you doing here?

422
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,382
You're not a very nice girl.

423
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,525
I mean, why the fuck would
you do something like this

424
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,855
to somebody who has an
earnest interest in you?

425
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,362
An earnest interest in raping me.

426
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,229
Is that how you remember it?

427
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,893
I seem to recall it differently.

428
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,934
No?

429
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,700
What do you want, Chuck?

430
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,302
What do I want?

431
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,311
What do I want?

432
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,888
- Can I get a ride?
- No.

433
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,584
Dave, right?

434
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,491
How do you know his name?

435
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,892
I'm Chuck.

436
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,465
Pleasure.

437
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,795
By the way, I'm really sorry
to hear about your dad.

438
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,064
It's...terrible.

439
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,300
No kid should have to go through that.

440
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,505
- Hi, pal.
- Hi.

441
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,514
Who the hell was that? And how
does he know about Dad?

442
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,846
Chuck Whitmore, starting QB for Willow

443
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,954
with a really fucked-up eye.

444
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,589
If either of you ever see him again,

445
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,122
just stay away from him.

446
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,830
Why are you here on your day off?

447
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
The sooner I get the cars
into racing shape,

448
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,201
the sooner I can sell them.

449
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,615
What's wrong?

450
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,550
Are you mothering your mom again?

451
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,782
No. She's away.

452
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,392
I just did something really stupid.

453
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,120
Like what?

454
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,794
You know that group of Willow Creek
football players?

455
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,302
Yeah. They drive by wasted all the time.

456
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,465
Yeah, well, Tracy and I went
to one of their parties,

457
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:57,205
and that guy Chuck tried to attack me.

458
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,381
Are you okay?

459
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,214
Yeah.

460
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,687
Look, if he ever comes near you again,

461
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,020
just promise me you'll
come to me for help.

462
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,201
You're pretty cute when you're worried.

463
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,199
Nice. That's nice.

464
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,504
How about when I'm not worried?

465
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,705
Un-cute?

466
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,747
No, no, no, no.

467
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,011
You're beautiful.

468
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,122
But, um, you worry a lot.

469
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,280
- So...
- I...

470
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,892
Nice save, Bobby.

471
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,290
- I should go.
- Uh...

472
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,897
No, well, look, don't...you don't
have to leave.

473
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,863
I'm gonna be working on this car
for a while,

474
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:55,630
so you're more than welcome to stay
if...you still want to.

475
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,401
Bobby, mind if I make a complete
and utter ass of myself?

476
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,441
The floor's yours.

477
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,580
I've been coming by for months.

478
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,737
We share all these intimate secrets,
and...

479
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,077
why haven't you asked me out?

480
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,047
I..I don't know.

481
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,456
Okay, uh...

482
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,757
sorry for putting you on the spot.

483
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,593
Bye.

484
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,302
What did the doctor say?

485
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,441
You can play, right?

486
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,942
Spot me. Spot me.

487
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,038
Alright. One more.

488
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,816
- What did the doctor say?
- Shut up!

489
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:22,356
Would you just shut the fuck up?

490
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,790
What'd the doctor say? He said
I'm fucking blind.

491
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,869
That if I'm lucky, I'll be seeing
in my right eye

492
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,397
in about 35 fucking years. That's
what the doctor said.

493
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,556
That someday maybe I'll end up being

494
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,795
some fucking townie piece
of shit loser like you, Guy.

495
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,634
Maybe someday if I'm fucking lucky!

496
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,798
Fuck!

497
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,844
Chrissie.

498
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,387
Ian, what's wrong?
What happened?

499
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,421
I was jumped.

500
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,219
- Did you see him?
- Who?

501
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:01,330
- Whoever did this.
- It happened too fast.

502
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,424
Does this have to do with you?

503
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,662
It's better if you just keep away from me.

504
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,738
But...

505
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,053
- So you hold it like that.
- Yeah?

506
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,247
- Make sure you press here.
- But what's that going to do?

507
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,255
Just ignore that. That's just decoration.

508
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,415
- Decoration?
- Yeah.

509
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,925
- You drew that?
- Yeah.

510
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,619
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah?

511
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,720
Okay, show me.

512
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,132
Show me.

513
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,402
Ugh!

514
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,972
God, this is not happening.

515
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,132
- Seriously?
- Wait! Hey!

516
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,074
Dave said the freak show showed up
at school today.

517
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,578
Shit, man.

518
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,615
Yeah, he came by school,
knew exactly who I was,

519
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,280
who my brother was, mentioned Dad.

520
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,323
Yeah? Hmm?

521
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,824
What are you doing?

522
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,758
You know, I think the freak show

523
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,091
was probably just trying to scare you.

524
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,460
What?

525
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,994
What are you not telling me?

526
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,336
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,443
In advance.

528
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,582
You agreed to what?
A fucking party here?

529
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,150
- Are you out of your mind?
- It was her idea.

530
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,981
- We came up with it together.
- It's all over Facebook.

531
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,646
Yeah, if you checked your page,
Tracy's page, or my page,

532
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,973
you would've known last week.

533
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,186
What's that supposed to mean?

534
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,420
- Tell her, Tracy.
- Yeah, tell me, Tracy.

535
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,786
We were just thinking you
could use a little social jolt

536
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,265
heading into summer.

537
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,028
How selfless of you both,
but no fucking way.

538
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,365
Tracy, you may like hooking up
with random dudes,

539
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,835
doing whatever drug they put in front
of your face,

540
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,201
but that's not me.

541
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,001
I have a dad who's an addict, okay?

542
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,145
Could even be dead by now, for all I know.

543
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,872
I don't want people doing weird shit
in this fucking house!

544
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,677
Cancel it.

545
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,650
What? Post it on Facebook.
Canceled.

546
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,447
It's not that easy.

547
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,490
It's been on our Twitter feeds.
We sent out a mass e-mail.

548
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,786
If you paid more attention to social media

549
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,430
instead of lurking around a gas station
between honors classes,

550
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,159
- you'd know.
- Shut up! Shut up!

551
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,962
Find a way to cancel that party.

552
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,298
And stop smoking that shit in the house!

553
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,542
Hey, Bobby. What's up?

554
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,016
Um...uh...

555
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,553
Chrissie's best-kept secret
here in the flesh.

556
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,521
Bobby, is it? I have heard so many
rad stories about you.

557
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,353
Weren't you in the middle of something
really important?

558
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,688
Oh, yeah, right, the party.
Tuesday night.

559
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,888
I hope you can make it, Bobby.

560
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,334
Urn, so...

561
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,370
Y..Yeah...

562
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,941
I came over here to, uh...

563
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,342
just to ask you if you would
like to go on a date with me.

564
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,345
Now?

565
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,042
No, not..not now. We
don't have to go now.

566
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,449
If you don't, if you can't...
I can come hack.

567
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,385
Now's perfect. Uh...

568
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,456
I'm just gonna go change real quick.

569
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,718
Okay.

570
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,562
Ohh...

571
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,724
It's beautiful.

572
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,452
Question...what where you thinking,

573
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,461
going to that party in the first place?

574
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,896
Why? Do I sense a little jealousy?

575
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,435
Let's...call it concern.

576
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,764
Next question.

577
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,105
What does a girl like you want
with a grease monkey like me?

578
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,305
God. I don't know.

579
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,747
You're, uh...

580
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,080
You're different.

581
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,787
So what do you think about this curse

582
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,758
everyone keeps talking about?

583
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,826
That's like asking if you believe in God,

584
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,697
the afterlife, the supernatural.

585
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,860
Do you?

586
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,667
No. The curse? Absolutely not.

587
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,811
What about God?

588
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,537
I mean, I'm not really a religious guy
or anything,

589
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,978
but just look at that sky.

590
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,176
Impossible that was man-made.

591
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,945
It's made up of molecules.

592
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,887
The clouds are made up
of tiny droplets of water

593
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,824
and ice crystals so light
they hang in the sky.

594
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,557
I flunked in whatever class
you learned that in, but...

595
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,327
let's agree it's not man-made.

596
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,799
Okay.

597
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,970
Um...

598
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,042
What about physical attraction?

599
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,346
Is that made up of molecules, too?

600
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,525
Sorry.

601
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,542
You're fucking...

602
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,948
You're fucking out of your mind, dude.

603
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,851
What the fuck are you doing here?

604
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,787
I need to talk to her.
It's really important.

605
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,858
No, it's not! Get the fuck out!

606
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:09,123
Bobby, it's fine, okay? I'll be back
in one second.

607
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,630
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

608
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,392
This is something that I have to do.

609
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,231
Roll your window up.
He's high as hell.

610
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,373
He tried to fucking rape you.

611
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,737
Bobby, I can handle this.

612
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,720
What? Are you stalking me?

613
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,584
Did you attack my friend Ian?

614
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,746
No.

615
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,459
I, uh...can I just...I need
to talk to you.

616
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,431
About what?

617
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,595
I've been thinking about
that thing you said.

618
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,433
The question you asked.

619
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:52,768
What question?

620
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,934
About what I want.

621
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,808
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

622
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,513
Um...I had a dream.

623
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,314
And it was fucking vivid.

624
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,821
And then all of sudden, it just...

625
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,426
all this stuff made sense.

626
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,085
What? What made sense?

627
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,361
This.

628
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,695
What are you talking about?

629
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,933
See, I know that you...

630
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,507
you're feeling the same thing I'm feeling.

631
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,337
Chuck...

632
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,206
I don't.

633
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,508
Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.

634
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,878
You have to.

635
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,145
- No. You're crazy.
- Right?

636
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,481
No, Chuck.

637
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,386
Yeah. And...

638
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,527
and that's why this all makes sense.

639
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,355
You know, that's why I forgive you.

640
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,861
Forgive me? Are you kidding?

641
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,398
That's why this is gonna work for us.

642
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,799
Chuck, there is no <i>we.</i>

643
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,462
There is no fucking <i>us.</i>

644
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,471
Whatever you think you know about me,

645
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,736
it's all fucking made up in your head.

646
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,141
All this shit you're doing, following me,

647
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,873
you need to stop it,

648
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,678
and you just need to keep the fuck away
from me, Chuck.

649
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,753
Stay the fuck away from me.

650
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,766
He followed us to the bluff.

651
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,669
What did he say exactly?

652
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,504
He thinks we're in some kind
of relationship.

653
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,374
Unfortunately there's not much
we can do with that.

654
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,015
This guy's serious.

655
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,775
He tried to rape me.

656
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,509
- Any witnesses?
- No.

657
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,745
He cornered me in a bathroom.

658
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,390
Hey, look, I mean, she's here now.

659
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,666
Do you guys really want to be the ones
who were warned

660
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,382
and then dropped the ball after the fact?

661
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,521
Can't just arrest him.
I can pay him a visit,

662
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,062
let him know we've been made aware.

663
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,222
Usually that's enough.
What's his name?

664
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,734
- Chuck Whitmore.
- Chuck Whitmore.

665
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,963
The WC football player.

666
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,766
Chuck Whitmore.

667
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,604
Yeah, Charlie Whitmore's son.
Charlie's one of us.

668
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,473
So what, that makes him untouchable?

669
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,309
I think it's best if we show it
to Charlie first.

670
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,041
That's enough for now.

671
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,447
When we know more, you'll know more.

672
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,315
- So that's it?
- Yeah.

673
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,889
That's it.

674
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,396
His dad's an ex-cop?

675
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:35,401
Right, yeah. Which is not a good thing.

676
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,061
Didn't make me feel any better.

677
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,469
As soon as I mentioned his name,
they completely changed.

678
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,234
I'm definitely staying over.

679
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,400
Awesome.

680
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,840
On the couch.

681
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,480
That's cool.

682
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,396
Jake pissed on it a bunch.
It's been cleaned.

683
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,007
I don't know if it ever really,
truly comes out,

684
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,447
but if you want to...

685
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,646
Stop. Please?

686
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,784
Well, hey, I don't want
to invite myself over...

687
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,624
Yes. Stay.

688
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,157
That'd be good.

689
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,495
Okay, cool. Well, um...

690
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,107
I guess I just need to let my boss know
I'll be in and out.

691
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,685
Are you sure you don't mind
sticking around?

692
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,610
No, of course not.

693
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,942
Does that thing work?

694
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,982
Okay, well, use it.

695
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:28,876
What are you doing?

696
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,040
Jesus!

697
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,050
I'm sorry.

698
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,246
I took a mean spill.

699
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,722
Your brother has some serious weed.

700
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,424
Hey, it's Bobby.

701
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,436
I don't have a condom,

702
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,139
and even if you do in your wallet,
I'm still a virgin,

703
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,582
and I'd like for it to stay that way,
temporarily.

704
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,089
You know, it hadn't even crossed my mind.

705
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,452
I was kidding.

706
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,620
It did, but I got rid of the idea quick.

707
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,663
Okay, um...

708
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,894
I should probably go to sleep 'cause
I have school tomorrow.

709
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,907
Will you be here when I get back?

710
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,838
Yeah, of course, if it makes you feel safe.

711
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,756
No sex.

712
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,155
Okay.

713
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,471
Maybe there is a curse,

714
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,597
and this year it's on me.

715
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,763
It's the curse.

716
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,612
Maybe I'm the curse.

717
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,458
Is that the mechanic's car?

718
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,060
It's nothing. Thanks for the ride.

719
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,524
It's not nothing. It belongs to that guy.

720
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,687
So why'd you have to fucking ask, Ian?

721
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,194
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

722
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,234
You barely said a word
the whole ride home.

723
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,065
You got a stranger's car in your driveway

724
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,367
and this look on your face like someone
is trying to kill you.

725
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,738
Oh, and your locker blew up.

726
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,642
You can't pretend like
it's just another day.

727
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,975
Hey, look, I've known you
since kindergarten.

728
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,484
You can tell me anything.

729
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,418
If you're worried about the curse,

730
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,286
there's only three days left to graduation,
and if there's...

731
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:02,830
Bobby, whose car it is, we started dating
and...

732
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,160
and the rest is PMS.

733
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,308
Guys, get out of your PJ's and
cancel that fucking party.

734
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,353
We tried. We posted Facebook messages
and...

735
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,456
We did our best, but it's in the ether,

736
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,616
and we can't stop people from showing up.

737
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,819
What's wrong? Something happen?

738
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,662
Are you sure it was him?

739
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,330
The fucking car battery
was in my locker, Tracy.

740
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,634
Where are you going?

741
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,144
It's probably better if
we don't talk about it.

742
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,543
- You can't.
- The hell I can.

743
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,378
If I don't do something about it,
it's just gonna get worse.

744
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,712
Bobby...

745
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:58,876
Come on.

746
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:01,023
Hey, listen to me.

747
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,350
Bobby?

748
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,686
Bobby, I'm serious. Come on.

749
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,829
Look, you don't know me that well.
I can take him.

750
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,623
You're right. I don't know you.

751
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,131
But I know that if you do
something stupid,

752
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,862
you could wind up in jail or worse.

753
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,973
And I'm not up for that.

754
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,248
Okay.

755
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,187
We'll do it your way.

756
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,753
- What is your way?
- I don't have a way.

757
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,584
I can't think.

758
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:39,888
You know, it might not be such
a bad idea to have the party.

759
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,691
Just hear me out. If this guy's
stupid enough

760
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:46,334
to show up at your door uninvited
with a bone to pick,

761
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,197
we'll have plenty of witnesses.

762
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,235
And as long as I can make sure
you're safe,

763
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,774
then the cops or his dad won't
be able to save him.

764
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:57,606
It's just nights like tonight that
I get so concerned about,

765
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,213
the nights where I won't be here.

766
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,440
I don't get off till 3 a.m.

767
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,448
I'll be here when you get back.

768
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,348
I promise.

769
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,182
You better be.

770
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,403
Your new boyfriend is rad.

771
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,938
And your girlfriend is a slut.

772
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,576
You're not gonna hear any complaints
from me.

773
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,872
She feels bad enough. So do I.

774
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,447
You remember how Dad
taught us how to shoot?

775
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,281
Yeah. I have permanent ear damage.

776
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,923
Well, I guess he was too scared
to use his shotgun on himself

777
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,821
before he left and forgot it
when he split.

778
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,589
It's in my room under my bed.

779
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,595
Good to know.

780
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,441
It's the curse.

781
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,870
Guys, please!

782
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,143
Guys!

783
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,045
Please?

784
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,886
Do you hear that?

785
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,230
Sounds like it's coming from outside.

786
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,556
Hey, Jake, what is it?

787
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,962
Call the cops.

788
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,285
Bobby!

789
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,455
If you keep this up, it's only
gonna get uglier.

790
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,726
Keep what up?

791
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,269
You made your point, alright?
Just let it go.

792
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,771
No, man.

793
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,239
I haven't even come close
to making my point.

794
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,471
So tell me, Bobby,

795
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,777
what the fuck are you gonna do about it?

796
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,781
Whatever I have to.

797
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,455
Let's take a walk.

798
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,628
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up, back up, back up!

799
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,135
Back up, back up.

800
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,935
Put that down.

801
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,100
Let's do this like men.
Put it down.

802
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,258
I love that you think this is
gonna make a difference.

803
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,312
When I'm done with her, you're
going to be tasting me

804
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,956
for the rest of your life.

805
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,011
Ooh!

806
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,657
There you go.

807
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,056
Good stuff.

808
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,008
I learned a lot about conflict resolution

809
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,440
in my advanced psych classes.

810
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,545
- Oh, did you?
- Mm..hmm.

811
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,080
The last resort is physical violence.

812
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,411
I would've had him had he not
cheap-shotted me.

813
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,848
Look, you know about my dad
and meth, right?

814
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,855
What I never told you was
that because of that

815
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,291
he owed some money to some bad people.

816
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,294
I spent too many nights
either fighting him off

817
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,865
or mending him.

818
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:55,902
So, please, do not go after Chuck again.

819
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,539
Hey, look at me.

820
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,739
Look at me.

821
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,404
Say it.

822
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,484
Say it.

823
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,816
I won't go after him again.

824
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,154
Good.

825
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,900
We gotta figure out what to do.

826
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,276
We can't just fucking sit around here
and just...

827
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,437
We're gonna fucking do something.

828
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,776
As soon as Chuck figures what we're doing,

829
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,098
we're gonna go fucking do it.

830
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,416
Whatever he says, that's
what we're gonna do.

831
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,852
What the fuck are we gonna do
about these two?

832
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,158
These chicks, man.

833
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,352
They think that they can get...

834
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:55,997
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm gonna fuck her friend.

835
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,360
- Her little faggot brother, too.
- I'm gonna fuck...

836
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,626
- So what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna do something.

837
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,790
We're going to fucking do something.

838
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,597
As soon as Chuck says what we're gonna do,
we're gonna do.

839
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,297
What about her faggot-ass little brother?

840
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,841
What about her brother?

841
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,103
You know what I think?

842
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,941
What did you say, Chuck?

843
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:19,478
I think she took my life,
and I wanna take hers.

844
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,281
Just like it says in the Bible, man,

845
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,514
an eye for an eye.

846
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,522
Clean this shit up before my dad
gets home.

847
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,354
Okay.

848
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,532
I think we got enough for the party.

849
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,695
Two parties.

850
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,811
- Come on. Go, go, go.
- Shit.

851
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,076
Go.

852
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,220
Lock the door. Don't open it.

853
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:03,591
Hi, Dave.

854
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,233
What's with the ski masks?

855
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,663
Hitting the slopes?

856
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,600
You got lots of stuff in the car.

857
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,933
Are you going to some big party
or something?

858
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,009
It'll distract me from my boredom.

859
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,715
How's that? Hmm?
That wake you up?

860
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:26,581
Are you still bored?

861
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,551
Where's Chrissie?

862
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,387
You tell me.

863
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,453
That's the spirit.

864
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,395
I want in that car.

865
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,394
Guy, take this little fucking scab
out back.

866
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,403
Teach him a lesson.

867
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:49,799
Fuck!

868
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,468
Get him!

869
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,884
Tracy, open the door.

870
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:03,320
Tracy, you open that door, and
I will kill you personally.

871
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,391
Leave him the fuck alone!

872
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,228
Fuck him up.

873
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,400
Aaw!

874
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,624
Ooh!

875
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,395
God, Dave, it looks like it
hurts so bad, huh!

876
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,834
Go and do it again.
One more time.

877
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:18,995
Okay, do it again.
Do it again.

878
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:26,646
Leave him the fuck alone!
Leave him alone!

879
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,655
You tell Mom?

880
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,659
- Not yet.
- Good. Don't.

881
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,422
I'm fine. Let her have her time.

882
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,997
She needs it.

883
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,328
You know who these guys are and yet
you do nothing.

884
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,437
We paid the boys a visit.
They were all nerves.

885
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,539
I could tell by their pupils
they were partying.

886
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:53,936
That's great. That's amazing.

887
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:56,008
So what's next? A line-up or something?

888
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,873
They were partying in their homes.

889
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,709
No contraband was visible and our
search warrant was rejected.

890
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,350
So what are you saying?

891
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,713
We don't have enough to arrest them yet.

892
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,378
They broke his hand in broad daylight.

893
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:10,491
Line them up.

894
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,719
Our hands are tied here, Chrissie.
I'm sorry.

895
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:18,798
Please leave me with my brother.
Please just go.

896
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,161
Just go.

897
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,973
This is all my fault.

898
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,475
There's good news.

899
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,203
What's that?

900
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,508
I'm like a hero to Tracy now.

901
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,742
This is gonna go down big for me.

902
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,476
I'm gonna milk it. Trust me.

903
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,382
It might even get me a home run.

904
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,752
Hey, you alright?

905
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,187
But we did get everything

906
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,728
we need for the party.

907
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,595
We got beer, vodka, tequila, cups.

908
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,207
Don't worry. I'll be okay.

909
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,337
You don't know who he is, do you?

910
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,807
Hey, what is this?

911
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,437
You're not a very nice girl.

912
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,282
What happened?

913
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,922
I was jumped.

914
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,307
See that fat fucking Beaner up there?

915
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,447
He just signed a guaranteed hundred
million dollar contract.

916
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,810
Fucking...

917
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:54,680
Know what Dolphins' first-round pick's
getting this season?

918
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,189
- 7.6 million goddamn dollars.
- That's a lot of money.

919
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,521
Yeah, that's a lot of fucking money,
isn't it?

920
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,823
You'll never find out. That's
for goddamn sure.

921
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:15,056
What the fuck is this?

922
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,371
Fuck.

923
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,894
Is this that Swanson girl?

924
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:19,878
Yeah.

925
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,481
I need your help.

926
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,517
I need you to keep everyone away
from that fucking party.

927
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,381
Okay. Yeah.

928
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,266
It felt like something was
creeping up behind me

929
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,435
and then nothing was there.

930
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,775
I'll..I'll call you right back, okay?

931
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,307
You're security?

932
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,646
I almost feel bad fucking your shit up
all over again.

933
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,722
Not me. I've been dreaming
about fucking your shit up.

934
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,221
What the fuck...

935
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,452
- Oh, my God!
- Turn the lights back on!

936
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,819
Shit. Dave?

937
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,772
Hmm? You scared now?

938
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,056
You should be ashamed of yourself.

939
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,467
I'm sorry.

940
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,829
No, you're not.

941
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,200
- I am.
- No, you're not!

942
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:02,867
Don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me.

943
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,880
I was thinking about that dream you had.

944
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,886
Don't lie to me.

945
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,188
You're so beautiful.

946
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,565
I'm so sorry.

947
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,350
Please.

948
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,555
- I wanna be with you.
- No, you don't.

949
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,387
- I do.
- No, you don't.

950
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,529
Get off!

951
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,961
I'm so sorry.

952
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,434
Chuck...

953
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,535
Please. It's okay.

954
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:28,317
Stop!

955
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,122
Get the fuck off me!

956
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,960
Get off me! Get off me!

957
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,831
Get off me!

958
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:42,671
Get off me! Get off me!

959
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,903
Get off me, please!

960
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,848
- Leave me alone.
- Get off of her!

961
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,454
Get off of her!

962
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,154
Slop!

963
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,134
You okay?

964
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,139
Stay here.

965
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,675
Okay.

966
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:27,103
You son of a bitch!

967
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:33,051
Bobby.

968
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:45,459
Are you okay?

969
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,897
Who taught you how to shoot like that?

970
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,037
So...

971
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,141
you just told the cops

972
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,257
that you took all those guys down
in self-defense,

973
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:04,845
and that's it?

974
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,639
And that's it.

975
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,181
You must be traumatized.

976
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,721
I passed that phase yesterday.

977
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,826
So let's do a head count.

978
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,484
Not the fucking curse again.

979
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,290
Seriously, have any seniors died yet?

980
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,297
Uh, not to my knowledge.

981
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,062
So the curse could still be real.

982
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:33,139
Ian, we bring this on ourselves.

983
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,536
There's no curse.

984
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,872
Some drunk senior is probably
about to drive

985
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,379
into a head-on with a semi
as we speak.

986
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,365
I should..I should go check on Bobby.

987
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:54,054
You're a mess. You need to chill for a sec.

988
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,522
Remember we used to push each other

989
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,529
to see who could get highest?

990
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,729
Do you love grease boy?

991
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,501
Don't be a dick. His name's Bobby.

992
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,405
Bobby doesn't deserve you.

993
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,239
Ian...

994
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,445
Don't.

995
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,550
I've always loved you.

996
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,111
- What happened?
- I was jumped.

997
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:24,811
We pray to thee, our God, this day.

998
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:29,116
But from ashes to ashes
and dust to dust...

999
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:35,091
I feel for all the people
who grieve for me.

1000
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,256
And from where I stand,

1001
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,490
I can say for sure that I was wrong.

1002
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,333
The curse of Downers Grove is real

1003
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,438
because the curse is everywhere.

1004
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,595
The curse is life.

1005
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,799
Another graduation called off

1006
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,285
and a funeral to take its place...

1007
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:54,508
Don't expect me to tell you
to believe in fate

1008
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,675
or that there's some supernatural force
guiding us all.

1009
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,684
I can only say this.

1010
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,845
It doesn't end here.

1011
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,612
Someone we know is gonna die.

1012
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,854
It's the curse.
