(LAUGHS)

659
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,327
When this girl came to me,
she was so pleased with herself,

660
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,964
because she'd been able to overcome
her phobia to the extent

661
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,700
that she could sit in the same room
as a closed banana.

662
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,336
It had to stay closed, unzipped,

663
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,305
or else she'd go
completely psychotic.

664
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,740
But the point is,
open or closed,

665
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,809
she had not made the connection

666

667
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,880
Of bananas?

668
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,382
No, she was afraid
of something else.

669
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,417
A past trauma.
Something far more

670
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:49,918
threatening than a mere banana.

671
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,754
Do you understand?
It's like a movie screen.

672
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,324
She projected her
fear onto the banana,

673
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,694
because looking directly at her trauma
was too terrifying.

674
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,495
It was a projection.

675
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,830

00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,432

Her banana's no different
to your launderette.

678
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,441
I also have a reoccurring nightmare.
About an eyeball.

679
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,777
What sort of eyeball?

680
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,979

682

All fears and neuroses can be traced
back to our early childhood.

683

terrifying recognition

01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,337
Front loading,

1205
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,472
motor power,

1206
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:54,841
elegant design.

1207
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,545
Oh, admittedly,
they don't spin as fast as

1208
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,580
the modern machines do,
but so what?

1209
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,650
As Mahatma Gandhi said,
"There's more

1210
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,652
"to life than simply
increasing its speed."

1211
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,022
And looking at this washing machine,
you'd have to agree with him.

1212
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,792
I mean, it's a bloody
work of art.

1213
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,798
I said it's a work of art.

1214
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,599
Don't you agree?

1215
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,102
Yes, it's very nice.

1216
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:26,173
Right, well, uh,
take comfort in that.

1217
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:30,310
Because it's the last thing you're going
to see before you die.

1218
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,581
If, if you both look closely,

1219
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:37,551
you'll notice a pea
green flashing light.

1220
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:41,154
Which means that while you
were both sleeping,

1221
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,456
this machine has
already passed smoothly

1222
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,193
through the stages of
pre-wash and main wash.

1223
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,028
And is now completing
the last rinse.

1224
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:51,064
(CLATTERING)

1225
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:53,266
Ow.

1226
01:12:55,037 --> 01:13:00,941
This will shortly be followed by
the magnificent "Final Spin,"

1227
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,678
at which point
the cycle will end,

1228
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,080
the light will turn red,

1229
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:13,787
and I shall have the pleasure of
sending you both to a better

1230
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:17,057
and, one would hope,
cleaner world than this.

1231
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,226
You fucking maniac.

1232
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,429
I was just gonna go home tonight
and catch some telly...

1233
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:27,033
<i>But when you mentioned you were a writer,
about serial killers,</i>

1234
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,068

01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,071

What's that, mate?

1239
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:39,246
What do you call yourself?
The... The Spin King? The Laundry Man?

1240
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,115
No, I'm the Hanoi Handshake!
That's me.

1241
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:45,285
After I kill you,
I'm going to chop your fingers off

1242
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:46,987
and pin it on
the Vietnamese lot.

1243
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:48,989
Why?

1244
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,258
Why are you doing this?

1245
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,927
Oh, well, it's complicated.

1246
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,998
You see, this launderette
used to belong to my grandmother.

1247
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,834
That is before the whole neighborhood
went to pot.

1248
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,403
Pol Pot.

1249
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,906
No, the uh, the boat
people elbowed her out.

1250
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,575
Broke her heart. Killed her.

1251
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,877
So, uh, I'm on a rampage.

1252
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,879
A rampage of vengeance.

1253
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:14,814
Oh, I... I see.

1254
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,783
Well, anyway...
That's not important now, though.

1255
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,384
What is important...

1256
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,021
Is that I've got the key,

1257
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,023
and no one knows we're here.

1258
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:24,858
So then, if you don't mind,

1259
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,929
I've just got to, uh, quickly go upstairs
and sharpen my knife.

1260
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:33,300
Sit tight, kids.

1261
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:43,009
And remember, when the light
goes red, you're dead!

01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,193
Hmm.

01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,595
The rinse is ending.

Not only am I not gonna make my meeting
with Harvey Humphries tonight,

I'm gonna fucking die! (SOBBING)

1270

Hey, stop it!

1271
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,423
You mustn't lose hope.

1272
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,092
There's no hope.

1273
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,726
We're dead.

1274
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,729
There is always hope!

1275
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,999
I was abandoned
in a launderette as a child.

1276
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:44,371
I couldn't speak for six weeks,
I was so afraid.

1277
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,340
I've come full circle.

1278
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:53,613
I'm alive, alive to experience
my own death.

1279
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:56,383
It's destiny!

1280
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,252
No!

1281
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:01,454
(FAINTLY) No!

1282
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,057
No!

1283
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,359
No!

1284
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:40,694
Listen, your mother,
she gave up on herself, not on you.

1285
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,663
You don't make the same mistake.

1286
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,166
We can do it together.

1287
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,538
Come on, we have to
try and reason with him!

1288
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,608
There's always hope.

1289
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,548
I don't even know your name.

1290
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,684
Sangeet. My name is Sangeet.

1291
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,554
Sangeet.

1292
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,023
That's a very beautiful name.

1293
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:15,128
Sangeet, do you think
if all this blows over

1294
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:19,732
you and I might perhaps
get some dinner or...

But how can you not like this?

1303
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,604
This is top-notch.
This is classic rock.

1304
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,708
Uh, no.

1305
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,278
Technically, this is
80's hair metal.

1306
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,447
What?

1308
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,485
Right!

1309
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:49,255
I'll have you know that
that track was number one

1310
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,557
in 25 separate
countries in 1986.

1311

Twenty-five!

1312
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,461
Now I think that
qualifies it as an

all-time rock classic.
Don't you?

1314
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,400
Yeah. Well, we,

You don't know what
you're talking about, anyway.

1322
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,657

a very vivid imagination.

<i>At the launderette.</i>

1342

<i>She took me in, bless her heart,
and looked after me, but...</i>

1343
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:24,050
<i>After a while, she decided there wasn't
really enough room</i>

1344
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:25,652
<i>for two people
upstairs in the flat.</i>

1345
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,254
<i>So she made me a room down here.</i>

1346
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,789
<i>Down in the cellar.</i>

1347
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,093
<i>It was... Well...</i>

01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,830
<i>It took a bit of
getting used to...</i>

1349
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,866
<i>But she only locked the hatch
very late at night.</i>

1350
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:46,339
<i>And I was allowed out,
to see the people coming and going.</i>

1351
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,675
<i>To watch them wash.</i>

What do you mean? "Poor thing"?

1355
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,554
You were abandoned, Tone.

1356
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:06,259
Mate, I had this whole
massive bedroom to myself!

This is a cellar, Tone!
It's a cellar!

01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,062
Yeah, but...

01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,163
Yeah, but look, it's Dickensian!

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,299
Well, how big was
your fucking bedroom?

1361
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,567
That's not the point.

keeps a child in a cellar!

01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:22,408
Hey, don't you say
a word about my gran.

1364
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,677
My gran was a very
special person.

1365
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,978
That's the kid talking.

1366
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:29,982
Look, any mother, even a twisted
hag bitch of a mother

1367
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:32,385
is better than no mother at all.
Come on, Tone.

1368
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:35,187
You were dumped!
Alone! In a cellar!

1369
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,624
Yeah, all right, thank you very much,
Sigmund Freud!

in the old hedgerow,
beside the churchyard.

1550
01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,711
there's always
a way across the road

that the false self,

played in surviving

Professor Friedkin.

1564
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:42,387
Next book, Harold must address
his destructive oedipal complex

1565
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,423
and help Brian with his tendency

1566
01:32:44,459 --> 01:32:46,392
towards malignant anal hoarding.
