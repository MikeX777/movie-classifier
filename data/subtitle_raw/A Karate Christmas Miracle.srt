1
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,916
Jesse, dinner's ready.

2
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,166
Jesse, dinner's ready. Come on!

3
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,000
Jesse? Jesse?

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Jesse, where are you?

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,541
Sweden, Finland,
Iceland, Germany,

6
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:47,291
England, Italy,
Spain, Portugal.

7
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:52,458
Okay, now I will list the last
ten U.S. presidents in order.

8
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,791
Donald Trump, Barack Obama,
George W. Bush,

9
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,875
Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush,
Ronald Reagan,

10
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,166
Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford,
Richard Nixon--

11
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,833
Richard Nixon was impeached.

12
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,875
No he wasn't, Mom!

13
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,000
He resigned.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,333
Hold on, let me finish my list.

15
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,375
Richard Nixon,
Lyndon B. Johnson.

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,583
Jesse, so what are
you doing exactly?

17
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm working on my 12
days of Christmas list.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,666
Last year, Dad told me
that if I did everything

19
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,750
on the list, I could have
whatever I wanted for Christmas

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,041
and this year, all I
want for Christmas is

21
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,500
for Dad to come home.

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,458
Oh, Jesse,
we've talked about this.

23
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,500
You know that Daddy
isn't coming home.

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,666
I know this is hard for you,

25
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,291
and I know you may not
understand what happened,

26
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,333
but I need you to know
that Daddy's gone.

27
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,416
No, Mom, he's not gone.

28
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,333
He's just not here.

29
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,375
I know that if I do everything
on my list, he'll come back.

30
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,708
Here.

31
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,958
I wish it was right, Jesse.

32
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,000
I wish it was, but...

33
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,708
just come on.

34
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,708
I think dinner's getting cold.

35
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,791
It's always cold, Mom.

36
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,750
Dad's a better cook.

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,625
Ha-ha, funny.

38
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,625
You know what else is funny?

39
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,083
What?

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,083
You didn't notice
that I lost a tooth.

41
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
You did?

42
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
From karate?

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,625
No, Mom, I'm ten years old.
It just fell out.

44
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,791
You silly goof.

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,750
Come on.

46
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,625
Good.

47
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,875
I'm not a psychologist,
but I do know people's minds.

48
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,666
I need to in order to get
the results that I do.

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,166
What did you say?

50
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:04,750
That's not in the
holiday spirit.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,208
I doubt you would succeed
with that kind of campaign.

52
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,250
Why? Because throwing ice
balls at kids eating

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,875
your competitor's
candy is not that nice.

54
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,916
Jesse, go easy on him.

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,750
I wasn't talking to you.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,541
Look, I gotta go.

57
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,958
I'll come up with a winning
marketing plan, I promise you.

58
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,916
Just no ice balls.

59
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,541
I'm done.

60
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,916
Ah, Jesse, where's the teacher,
instructor...

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,166
You mean Sensei.

62
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,791
Yes, Sensei.
Where is he?

63
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,250
First of all, it's a she.

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,166
My Sensei is a woman.

65
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,416
I hadn't noticed.

66
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,416
I know.

67
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,666
Well, where is she?

68
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,791
I told her I need
to go it alone.

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,458
Go it alone?

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,791
Yeah, I have to earn
my black belt on my own

71
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,000
and I have to do it
by Christmas day.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,666
Uh, what?

73
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,625
Jesse, a black belt
by Christmas day?

74
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,791
And teaching yourself?

75
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,666
Yep, read my list.

76
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,041
Christmas is only
five days from now.

77
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,083
People will think this is
greed and hatred, it's not.

78
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,833
It's just that things
need to be even.

79
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,750
They can ask why but,

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,625
they'll never understand.

81
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,125
The people that hear
about it on the news,

82
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,500
they won't understand.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,791
Only those that come here
tonight will finally see

84
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,541
what it's like,

85
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,666
what it's like to be destroyed by someone you thought

86
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,750
was exactly like you.

87
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,541
Tonight, this town
learns what it's like

88
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,875
to be afraid.

89
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,083
Mom?

90
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,750
Mom?

91
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,000
Mom!

92
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,083
Mom!

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,958
-Mom, Mom, Mom!
-What is it, Jesse?

94
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,125
What's wrong?

95
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,583
I had a terrible nightmare.

96
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,708
There was this scary
man on a screen.

97
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,541
I didn't know what
he was talking about.

98
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,583
Then there was
a clown with a gun.

99
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,750
A clown?

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,750
Yes, and a woman.

101
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,625
Jesse, why did you dream
of that? Do you know?

102
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,708
It was a theater...

103
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,500
the theater where Dad
was when he disappeared.

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
But Jesse, you've never
been in that theater.

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,958
Felt so real.
I feel like I was there.

106
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,583
I know. Sometimes
bad dreams feel real.

107
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,125
But it was just a dream, okay?

108
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,125
You weren't there.

109
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,291
Please go back to sleep.

110
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,041
Can you stay here for a while?

111
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,625
Sure, okay, I will.

112
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh, my God.

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,291
All right,
pass 'em down,

114
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,625
pass 'em down.

115
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,333
Y'all keep 'em upside down now.

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,750
Don't talk about it, all right?

117
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,500
Just pass 'em down.

118
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,166
Pass 'em down.

119
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,833
Everybody pass these
down, keep 'em upside down.

120
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,041
Don't talk.

121
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,791
I want everybody
to think Christmas

122
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,041
because I have something
for you little critters.

123
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,833
I can call you critters, right?

124
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,750
That ain't one of them
forbidden words or something?

125
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,333
Nah, critters is okay.

126
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,375
But how 'bout I
call you my elves?

127
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,916
Oh no, how 'bout my reindeer?

128
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,875
Yeah, you're all little reindeer

129
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,458
but without the horns
'cause I don't like horns.

130
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,416
They kinda remind
me of that devil guy,

131
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,166
and he ain't very
Christmassy, is he?

132
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:05,375
Okay, if you answer
my question correctly,

133
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,000
then you might get
an extra five points

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,541
on your paper as
a Christmas gift.

135
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,500
All right,
all you little reindeer,

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,125
y'all are out celebrating
with your boss.

137
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,208
You're in a bar.

138
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,375
You know,
celebrating with the boss,

139
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,708
that little chubby guy,
ya know?

140
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,750
Little red suit
with a beard, Santa?

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,833
Santa has had a whole lot
of beer to drink tonight.

142
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,625
In fact, he's just plum wasted.

143
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,458
All you little reindeer,

144
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,083
y'all are pretty
kicked to the curb too,

145
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,875
ya know what I'm saying?

146
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,500
Now, all of a sudden, you,

147
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,541
you are Rudolph
the red-nosed reindeer.

148
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,708
And that red bulb on your
nose, it just explodes

149
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:57,666
because you had
a tequila shot that just
didn't agree with you.

150
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,833
Now, that explosion is
so loud that it causes

151
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,666
some drunk guy to fall off
of his bar stool over here

152
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,500
and all of a sudden,
a big ol' brawl ensues,

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,208
and everybody's
just fightin' kinda like

154
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,875
in one of them movies, ya know,

155
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,958
where everybody's just fighting
for no apparent reason?

156
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,875
All these surfers
and these greasers

157
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,416
and don't ask me
why there's surfers

158
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,208
and greasers in this bar.

159
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,041
Okay, they just are along
with all you reindeer.

160
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,916
And all of a sudden ,

161
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,666
Santa just broke a chair
right over some greaser's head

162
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,833
because the greaser
was about to hit you,

163
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,833
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer!

164
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,958
The greaser was about to hit
you with a whiskey bottle!

165
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,500
Everybody get it?
All right.

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,041
Raise your hand if you
think Santa is guilty

167
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,666
of aggravated assault.

168
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,333
All right, raise your
hand if you think Santa

169
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,416
has committed a simple assault.

170
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,666
Okay, now who thinks

171
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:12,500
Kris Kringle is
guilty of reckless endang--

172
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,208
The answer is
none of the above.

173
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,833
Do I know you, young man?

174
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,041
Santa Claus is
guilty of nothing.

175
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,083
He acted in defense of another.

176
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,833
He was protecting
his friend, Rudolph.

177
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,458
You're correct.
You are absolutely correct!

178
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,000
Are you Jesse?

179
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,708
So, your husband's a lawyer?

180
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,000
Look, it was really nice
that your kid interrupted

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,166
my classroom.

182
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,583
He's really smart, by the way.

183
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,500
-But Mrs. Uh...
-Abby.

184
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,333
I don't really
know why you're here.

185
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,708
It's kind of one of the
hazards of those online

186
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,791
appointment things.

187
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,791
You don't really know why people

188
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,625
make those appointments with ya.

189
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,666
If ya have a legal question,
why don't you just uh...

190
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,375
How did you know that
my husband is a lawyer?

191
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,125
Just a little deductive
reasoning based on

192
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,500
your son's answer to my
question in my class.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,208
Look, I'm sure that you have
a whole lot of things to do.

194
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,125
It was really nice to meet you.

195
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,166
I'm sure there's got a
lot of Christmas shoppin'

196
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,375
still to go for that smart
little young man of yours.

197
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,708
But I think it's
time for you to go.

198
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,458
How did you know
my son's name?

199
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,458
Good guess.

200
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,791
I don't think so.

201
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,541
Now, you let Jesse come
and interrupt my class

202
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,333
but why didn't you have
him come in here with us?

203
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,833
When I was 16,
I went to a psychic fair

204
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,083
and got a reading.

205
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,916
You know what that is?

206
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,458
Yeah, I...

207
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,291
The psychic told me
that I would get married,

208
00:12:55,291 --> 00:13:01,375
have one son, and that my
husband would go on a journey

209
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,875
that would be of a
major concern to me.

210
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:09,375
When I asked her for more,
she looked unhappy and then,

211
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,250
refused to tell
me anything else.

212
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,166
That psychic was you.

213
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,625
Look,

214
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,208
I don't know who you are 'cause
I don't remember you, OK?

215
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,666
But nobody around here
knows anything about my

216
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,833
psychic past stuff.

217
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,250
Now I don't even know
how you found me.

218
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,083
How did you find me, by the way?

219
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,916
Everyone in my profession

220
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,208
says I'm a very
resourceful woman.

221
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,250
And what profession is that?

222
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,291
Why don't you guess?

223
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,166
-Marketing.
-Yes.

224
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,583
Oh, dang!

225
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,583
You see?

226
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,083
No, no, I don't see.

227
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,208
I mean, I do see but
I don't wanna see, OK?

228
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,208
I used to help police.

229
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,125
They wanted me to help
them find missing people

230
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,208
and you know what I found?

231
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,083
I found a bunch of dead bodies.

232
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,000
It's all I could see and I
don't wanna see a bunch of

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,666
dead bodies, OK?

234
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,583
You have no idea what it's
like to see dead people

235
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:10,416
and ugh, it's just creepy and
it creeped me out so much!

236
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,125
I didn't wanna do it anymore.

237
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,125
So I paid my way through law
school by doing all those

238
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,166
stupid little psychic fairs
and you just happened to

239
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,250
find me out but I think it's
time for you to leave, OK?

240
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,250
Because I don't want
to remember any of it.

241
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,666
I don't!

242
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,541
I just wanna do something happy.

243
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,541
I wanna do something with kids.

244
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,291
So, Allison, I paid my
way through law school

245
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,083
and I just had this vision.

246
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,541
I saw myself in a
classroom with kids

247
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,000
and that's what brought me here.

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,416
The spirits brought me here.

249
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,500
I need you to tell me if
my husband is alive or dead.

250
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,750
And I told you I
don't do that anymore.

251
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,375
I don't want to see dead bodies.

252
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,666
I really think it's time
for you to leave, OK?

253
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
You know.

254
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,583
What, is it 'cause
I'm having nightmares?

255
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,583
Your son is having
nightmares too.

256
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,708
Did you know that?

257
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,208
It's all about his
Daddy's disappearance.

258
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
It's really not a
fun thing to see.

259
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,041
You really have no idea!

260
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,458
Oh.

261
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,250
That's why I'm sensing clowns.

262
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,833
Oh.

263
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,166
Oh wow, I'm really sorry.

264
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,333
I'm really sorry for you
and I'm sorry for your son,

265
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,291
but I can't help you, OK?

266
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,833
-I really can't.
-You still have it.

267
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,000
It's like a
terminal disease, OK?

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
It's not a fun thing.

269
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,916
I'm just kinda known as the
wacky professor around here, OK?

271
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,750
Sorry.

272
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,000
This is not exactly
what I asked Santa for.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,250
It was Bob's.
The police found--

274
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
Found it in a
alleyway, I know.

275
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,291
They found it in a alleyway
right behind the theater.

276
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,833
Oh, that tragedy.

277
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,041
He pulls his knife
out and he's using it

278
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,500
in self defense.

279
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,208
Karate.

280
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,791
What?

281
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,375
Karate, I don't know.

282
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:35,166
Uh... yeah.

283
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,666
Jesse's trying to get
his black belt in karate

284
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,166
by Christmas Day.

285
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,125
He thinks it will
bring his father back.

286
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,625
It might.

287
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,208
You think it will?

288
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,000
No, I didn't say that it will.

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,333
I said that it might.

290
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,708
Sorry, like I said, I can
get a little scattered, OK?

291
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,333
Everybody around here
thinks I'm scattered.

292
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,166
I'm just known as that little
wacky law professor here.

293
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,791
I really, I'm really
sorry for you.

294
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,375
I'm really sorry for you.

295
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,666
I can't help you.

296
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,541
My home address
is on the back.

297
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,791
So you can return the knife.

298
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,708
I have to take
Jesse to karate now.

299
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,875
He's already on his green belt.

300
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,666
-What's this, Jesse?
-It's on the list.

301
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,833
It's all about karate
now and you know,

302
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,458
getting my black belt.

303
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,291
But we can paint this later
like Dad and I used to.

304
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,583
Ah, I'm really no good
at this kinda thing.

305
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,541
Hey, the pizza's here.

306
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,666
It's not even cold!

307
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,291
We will haunt these victims.

308
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,083
We'll haunt their
minds, their dreams,

309
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,166
even the very land
they walk on.

310
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,875
And our victims won't hate us.

311
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,708
They'll become us.

312
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,166
Dad!

313
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,250
Dad!

314
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,708
There's no
constitutional issue here.

315
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,291
People are permitted
to carry guns,

316
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:34,333
but only in very
specific circumstances.

317
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,375
Dad!

318
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,708
Dad!

319
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,666
-Dad!
-Jesse, wake up.

320
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,250
Wake up, honey.

321
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,666
I just saw Dad, I'm
telling you, he's alive.

322
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,250
I need to get that black belt.

323
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,375
I don't want you to get hurt.

324
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,166
Mom, I'm tough.

325
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,958
I don't mean by karate.

326
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,583
Mom, I'm already
on the blue belt.

327
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,083
Dad will be coming home
soon when I prove that I

328
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,583
earned my black belt.

329
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,833
That's what I'm
talking about, Jesse.

330
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,375
Getting a black belt is not
going to bring back Daddy.

331
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,666
These are just
dreams you're having.

332
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,666
Then how do you
explain my dreams?

333
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,416
I saw you got some
newspaper clippings

334
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,958
about what happened.

335
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,625
That's why you're
having these dreams!

336
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,208
But why didn't you tell
me exactly what happened?

337
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,958
Because you're
so young, Jesse,

338
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,833
and I really didn't
think you needed to hear

339
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,625
all the horrible details
they write in the newspapers.

340
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,666
Then why didn't you tell
me Dad was at the theater

341
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,625
trying to make a constitutional
argument about guns?

342
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,875
How did you know that?

343
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,791
That wasn't in the news.

344
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,666
Gravy speaks Christmas.

345
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,750
No, no, it's not just
a Thanksgiving thing!

346
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,666
You have roast
beef on Christmas.

347
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,333
So you have gravy.

348
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,916
A whole chicken,
you put gravy on it.

349
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,375
What, prime rib?

350
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,958
No, that's au jus.

351
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,833
Au jus is a whole
different thing.

352
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,583
Uh huh, yes.

353
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,708
Yes.

354
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,958
Yeah, now you're thinking, OK.

355
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,000
And I can pull that off
by making Santa Claus

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,083
stir the gravy and then pour
it right over the turkey
for Mrs. Claus.

357
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,291
That way, we kill two
birds with one stone!

358
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,708
It's not just women in
the kitchen anymore.

359
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,875
And turkey gravy is hot
on a cold Christmas day.

360
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,791
OK.

361
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,833
Now let me go, I have
someone sitting here.

362
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,791
Seems like
it was just yesterday

363
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,291
that you were in high
school living next door.

364
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,750
You're graduating college?

365
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,708
Grad school actually, yeah.

366
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,416
-Oh my.
-Holiday break, of course.

367
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,375
You know, it was perfect
timing when you called because

368
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,875
I really need cash for presents.

369
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,083
So, I'm gonna pick
him up after school,

370
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,625
take him to karate and what not?

371
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,083
And maybe make him a snack
when you bring him home.

372
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,708
I work late a lot but ever
since his father went missing,

373
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,125
-I've just
-I am really sorry, Abby.

374
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,833
I remember your husband Bob.
He was a really cool guy.

375
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,750
Thank you.

376
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,583
It must be really
rough on Jesse.

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
I think it is.

378
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,291
I mean, it definitely is.

379
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,958
He's been obsessed with
completing this list of goals

380
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,875
that he set for himself.

381
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,250
I think they were all things
he used to do with his father.

382
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,166
They used to do a lot
of things together

383
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,958
that I wasn't a part of, ya
know, because I'm at work a lot.

384
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,375
I mean, me and Jesse have done
our own things together too.

385
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,500
I understand, Abby.

386
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,208
Um, he's had
these dreams, Sarah.

387
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:58,666
And some of it is rather
amazing, almost mystical.

388
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,833
But now, he's obsessed with
teaching himself to be a

389
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:07,791
back belt in karate,
by Christmas Day, no less.

390
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,541
And he thinks if
he gets a black belt,

391
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,000
it'll bring his father back?

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,125
Yeah, how did you know that?

393
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,833
I studied child
behavior and psychology.

394
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,750
It's a coping mechanism.

395
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,791
Reliving and doing all these
things that he used to do

396
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,250
with his Dad, earning his
missing Dad's approval

397
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,916
in a way so that
he'll come back.

398
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,583
And when he doesn't?

399
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,791
Well, what did your
grief counselor say?

400
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,541
-Well...
-Oh, you never got...

401
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,833
Jesse's a very smart kid.

402
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,583
He's determined, working hard.

403
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,208
He's fine.

404
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,875
He doesn't need a therapist.

405
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,833
Right, I shouldn't
have said anything.

406
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,333
No, no, you're
not the first one.

407
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,958
But we're doing just fine.

408
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,041
We're both strong and busy.

409
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,666
There's always so much
that needs to be done.

410
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,208
I mean, I'm sure it
works for others,

411
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,833
but not for Jesse, no.

412
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,875
Does he have any
dietary restrictions?

413
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,500
Timothy, kick him.

414
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,916
Kick, kick.

415
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,083
Fast.

416
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,875
Deeper, deeper.

417
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,291
You tapped him out again.
Stand up.

418
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,083
Applesauce is
amazing these days.

419
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,166
It's the new Jell-O!

420
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,041
You can get it with
maple syrup, cinnamon--

421
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,333
Are you kidding me?

422
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,833
Of course!

423
00:23:55,833 --> 00:24:00,208
-I can market applesauce
with jalapenos.

424
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,958
I'm sorry, I have
to call you back.

425
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,125
Bob?

426
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,250
Where are you?

427
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,791
Who is this?

428
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,875
Where did you find this phone?

429
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:27,250
So, the Grinch suddenly
has this need for redemption

430
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,708
and he really wants
to be punished.

431
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,208
Maybe he just wants some
of that camaraderie thing

432
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,000
that prison brings
with all the prisoners

433
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,750
after all them years
of being alone up there.

434
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,791
Anyways, he strolls into
the Whosville DA Office

435
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:48,000
and he confesses to grand
larceny, trespassing,

436
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,833
and criminal mischief.

437
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,166
Only, there ain't
no criminal charges

438
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,250
been filed against him.

439
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,208
So, what is the responsibility
of the prosecutor?

440
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,875
The green guy, he even
brought in a whole bunch

441
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,875
of the stolen goods, like a
whole bunch of Christmas toys.

442
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,625
Class dismissed.

443
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,666
Um, that's it?

444
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,125
Yeah, that's it.

445
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,416
You're even gonna get a
little extra bonus for it, OK?

446
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:36,041
So, go home, it's
almost Christmas.

447
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,500
Go home for clown's sake.

448
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,125
OK.

449
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,875
Merry Christmas.

450
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,541
Merry Christmas to you too.

451
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,875
I'm sorry,
I'm looking for someone.

452
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,958
The needy people
won't start coming in

453
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,166
for about an hour.

454
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,500
You could start
dishing out this.

455
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh uh, no, obviously
I'm not here for the...

456
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,833
I thought you said
people weren't arriving

457
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,250
for about an hour.

458
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,250
I guess they came early.

459
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,875
So you can name all the
presidents and you know all

460
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,291
the capitols, but what
I'm really impressed with

461
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,125
is this birdhouse.

462
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,666
Are you gonna paint it?

463
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,750
Yeah! With my dad
when he comes home.

464
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,458
Well how 'bout
with your mom now?

465
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,916
She's busy a lot.

466
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,000
She doesn't do
that sort of thing.

467
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,541
Wanna help me
practice my karate?

468
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:42,750
I would be honored.

469
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,541
Are you Jay?

470
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,916
Do I look like Jay?

471
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,333
I'm sorry, I don't
know what Jay looks like.

472
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,833
Do I look like aJay, hmm?

473
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,541
Um sure, why not?

474
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,583
Jay's a pretty common name.

475
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,125
J's a letter of the alphabet

476
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,916
and I don't think I
look like a letter.

477
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,833
It's also a bird,
as in blue jay,

478
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,041
and I'm not blue.

479
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,333
Do I look blue to you?

480
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,041
Huh, are you trying
to call me blue?

481
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,375
How would you like it
if I called you W, huh?

482
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:18,083
I don't, I uh, I'm
just looking for Jay,

483
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,666
the guy who owns
this restaurant.

484
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,458
Ya know, if you
haven't noticed,

485
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:25,666
today this place is set up to
feed people less fortunate,

486
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,416
people not like yourself.

487
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,833
We usually do this twice
a month, but this month,

488
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,708
we're doing it four times
because it's Christmas

489
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:36,041
and Jay, that blue bird
guy you're looking for.

490
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,250
He sold this spot to
me over a year ago.

491
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,291
It's mines now.

492
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,375
Oh, I'm sorry.

493
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,125
He said to meet him here.

494
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,791
Heh, yo, hold up, babe,
hold up, hold up.

495
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,291
I was just kiddin' around.
I was just joking.

496
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,291
Jay! Yo, Jay!

497
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,541
There's this chick out
here to see you, man.

498
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,208
Hey, he still owns this place.
He and I are best friends.

499
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,458
I'm just here helping him out.

500
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,250
Had you shook,
though, didn't I?

501
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:08,166
Hi, I'm Jay, and I apologize
for Sam's sense of humor.

502
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,666
I'm Abby.
You have my husband's phone?

503
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,583
You're Bob's wife.
I've heard so much about you.

504
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,458
Yeah.

505
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,583
One of the regulars
found it under the booth.

506
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,041
How did you know Bob?

507
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,958
Bob used to do free
legal work for us.

508
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,416
He was so generous
with his time.

509
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,166
Used to stop by
every now and again

510
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,875
and serve food if we had
nothing else for him to do.

511
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:38,166
Of course, that was
a long time ago.

512
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,458
So you haven't
seen him in a while.

513
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:44,000
No, not since the...
ya know?

514
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,833
Since the theater shooting.

515
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:49,041
Yeah.
Is everything all right?

516
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,791
But how could his
phone have gotten here?

517
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,625
I'm really sorry.

518
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,541
I don't know how long
it had been here.

519
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,958
Hello?

520
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,583
Professor?

521
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,000
What do you mean the knife
wasn't used in self defense?

522
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,708
Wait, wait, wait, you're
not making any sense.

523
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,375
Where?

524
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,791
So what's the meaning
behind all these belts?

525
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,208
Well, they all
start with white.

526
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:36,208
That signifies the beginning
or birth of a seed.

527
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,958
A white belt is a beginner
searching for knowledge

528
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,708
in the beginning
of life's cycle.

529
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:45,041
The yellow belt symbolizes
the first beams of sunlight

530
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,375
which shine upon the seed,
giving it new strength

531
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,833
with the beginning of new life.

532
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,708
Knowledge is germinating.

533
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:56,375
An orange belt represents
the growing power of the sun

534
00:29:56,375 --> 00:30:00,083
as it warms the earth to
prepare for new growth.

535
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:05,000
The body and mind are
starting to open and develop.

536
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,958
The green belt signifies
the growth of the seed

537
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:11,541
as it reaches toward the
sun and begins to transform

538
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,166
into a recognizable life.

539
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,958
There is strengthening
of the mind

540
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,333
and refining of techniques.

541
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,000
A blue belt represents
the blue sky

542
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,875
as life sprouts from the earth.

543
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:25,125
The light feeds the life
so it can continue to grow.

544
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,208
Additional knowledge
and power are obtained.

545
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:33,083
The purple belt represents the changing of the sky to dawn.

546
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,208
Here, there is
great advancement.

547
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,250
It takes longer to get
through purple belt

548
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,291
than all the previous belts.

549
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,583
Wow.

550
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,375
Well what about all
the other belts?

551
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,625
Ugh, I'm only up
to a purple belt.

552
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,500
So can you cut a kid a break?

553
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,125
The remaining three belts
are red, brown, and black.

554
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:57,083
The red belt signifies the
red hot heat of the sun.

555
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:01,875
Life growing strongly towards it
but red is a sign of danger.

556
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,041
And a fighter, well, he can
become dangerous with his

557
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,291
knowledge and his
physical ability.

558
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:12,250
So, he has to be cautious
and red is next for Jesse.

559
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,208
Do you wanna know
about the brown belt?

560
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,375
The brown belt, well, it
represents the ripening

561
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,875
of a seed.

562
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:23,833
It's sort of a
harvesting process.

563
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,333
And a fighter, he's gonna
wrestle the longest with

564
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:30,541
gettin' his brown belt because
the next stop is greatness.

565
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,791
And that greatness
is the black belt?

566
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,333
Yes.

567
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,125
And with the black belt
comes profound knowledge

568
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,833
and that's knowledge that
he can pass on to others.

569
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,875
OK.

570
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,958
I'm interested but I'm confused.

571
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,708
Why are we at Jesse's
karate school.

572
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,750
Same knife.

573
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,625
I don't understand.

574
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,333
It just came to me right
when I was in the middle

575
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,333
of a lecture because that's
when things seem to come to me,

576
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,041
at the most inappropriate times.

577
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,250
What does any of this
have to do with my husband?

578
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,791
In my vision, Bob was
not holding this knife.

579
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,291
He wasn't even lookin' for it.

580
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,875
He wasn't even aware
that he had it.

581
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,041
Um, your visions are making me

582
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,750
more tired than those women.

583
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,708
Who are they?

584
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,541
What relevance do
they have to Bob?

585
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:33,791
Abby, psychic
vision isn't 20/20.

586
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:37,541
It's not like ya' know, well
it's kinda like nearsightedness

587
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,541
but only in my case,
it's like bifocals.

588
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,583
I was wrong, I was wrong.

589
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,625
I don't like to admit when
I was wrong but I was wrong.

590
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,750
Bob was not using this
knife to defend himself

591
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,166
in that theater.

592
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,458
He was using it
here to teach women

593
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,416
how to defend themselves.

594
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,250
This is a self defense
class for women.

595
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,291
This is where this
knife comes from.

596
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,958
Bob was using this
to teach these women

597
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,666
how to defend themselves
and he just left with it.

598
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,875
He forgot he even had it on him.

599
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,208
No, this doesn't make sense.

600
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,958
Maybe the powers of the
universe are trying to

601
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,708
teach ya something, Abby.

602
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,041
Maybe guide you to learn a
little bit about your husband,

603
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:21,958
things you didn't even know.
Maybe even surprise you.

604
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,958
Not like bad surprises
or something.

605
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,083
It's not like Bob had a whole
'nother family or something,

606
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,500
-you know, like that.
-You're wasting my time.

607
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,333
Hey Abby, your husband
was a black belt.

608
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,708
What?

609
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:37,416
Then live, you attractive
geniuses, and live large!

610
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,208
Hello out there in Crazyland.

611
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:44,958
I'm Graham Palace, owner
of the Palace Theater chain

612
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,416
and, of course,
this classic theater.

613
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:50,416
As my lovely daughter told
you, this is the crown jewel

614
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,125
in our empire,

615
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,708
and the place we end up
spending most of our time.

616
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:59,958
What she didn't tell you is
that today is her birthday.

617
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,333
Dun dun!

618
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,375
Everyone say happy birthday.

619
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,416
No, no, no, no,
that was terrible.

620
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,166
One more time.

621
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,500
All together.

622
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,333
Happy birthday!

623
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,333
And Aurora, as your
birthday gift in front of

624
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,416
all these wonderful people,

625
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,625
I'd like to give you
this Palace Theater.

626
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,500
I cede full control over
to you to finally do

627
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,708
all the things with it that
you've been yapping about

628
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,875
all these years.

629
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,833
So get ready.

630
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:38,583
You clowns, you two-faced hags.

631
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:41,500
She's got big plans
for this place

632
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,333
and she's the smartest,
most driven person I've met

633
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,416
and that says a lot.

634
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,250
I love you, Aurora.

635
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,958
And I know you'll be great.

636
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,541
But remember...

637
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,458
I will be watching you.

638
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,541
Tell your mother.

639
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,541
Then...

640
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,666
..you must remain silent...

641
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,500
...until Christmas Day.

642
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,625
That's the day you
earn your black belt.

643
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,958
Hey, hey, another dream?

644
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,750
The woman who
owned the theater.

645
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,666
-Aurora Palace?
-Yes.

646
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,083
What about her?

647
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,833
She was very close
with her father too.

648
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,416
How do you know that?

649
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,041
Because I saw him
speaking to her.

650
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,875
He gave her the theater
as a present on the night

651
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,333
of the shooting.
On the night Dad went missing.

652
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,000
On Christmas Day last year.

653
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,500
Yes, it was her birthday.

654
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,166
She was the only person
to survive the shooting.

655
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,041
It was a miracle
on her birthday.

656
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,875
On Hisbirthday.

657
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,708
Christmas wasn't
your father's birthday.

658
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,833
That's not what I
was talking about.

659
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,250
Jesse, what does
Aurora Palace's father

660
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,833
have to do with Daddy?

661
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,625
Dad has a Christmas
gift for me this year

662
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,708
like Aurora's father
had for her last year.

663
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,500
What makes you think this?

664
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,458
But I have to earn my
black belt like Aurora earned

665
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,833
the theater.

666
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,416
Jesse, what makes you
think this, what is it?

667
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,208
Mom, I have
a message for you.

668
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,750
I have to remain completely
silent from now

669
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,833
until Christmas Day and
focus on only one thing,

670
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,416
getting Dad back.

671
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,875
He says he needs
to earn getting his--

672
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,500
Earn getting
his black belt before Christmas

673
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,250
in order to get his daddy back,
and now he doesn't wanna talk?

674
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,166
How could I have not
known my own husband

675
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,875
had a black belt in karate?

676
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:59,125
Well, I sense that he
was trying to tell you,

677
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,333
but you're just
too busy to listen.

678
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,708
Is this what the spirits
are telling you?

679
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,583
That I was neglecting
my husband or something?

680
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,833
No, right now,
the only spirits that are

681
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,791
talking to me are
in those bottles.

682
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,833
Look, you are a very
successful businesswoman

683
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:25,250
and you're a pretty
average mother.

684
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,041
I'm more than
an average mother.

685
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,541
Maybe, but you do need
to pay more attention.

686
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:34,125
And I worked very
hard all my life.

687
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:39,291
Yes, you work hard
but you also had a pony.

688
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,916
You went to private prep school.

689
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,708
You even had a sweet
16 coming out party.

690
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:50,500
And you went to Yale and
your parents paid for

691
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,125
absolutely everything.

692
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,833
You had a very lavish wedding.

693
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,708
Ya' had an even more
lavish honeymoon

694
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,833
and you get a new
car every two years?

695
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,791
Whoop-de-doo.

696
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:12,625
Ouch! She's batting 1,000,
and the crowd goes wild.

697
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,916
Now, your husband John...

698
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:22,916
Bob.

699
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,625
That's what I said.

700
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,000
No, you said John.

701
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,666
Robert.

702
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:31,083
Robert, he had to work for
every single thing he has.

703
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,291
He had to pay his own
way through law school

704
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,583
just like me.

705
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,083
Do you know that he
used to tutor kids

706
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,041
and he even worked
as a bartender!

707
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,625
Yay for bartenders, whoo-hoo!

708
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,958
And he worked
as a bouncer in a bar.

709
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:49,916
That way, he could hobnob
with all the right wizards.

710
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,041
Do you know what though?

711
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,333
He never, ever once
forgot where he came from

712
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,916
or who he was.

713
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,916
How am I doing so far?

714
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,666
Score two.

715
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:09,875
Bartender, can we get
another one of these for me

716
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:15,708
and one for my very privileged,
poor little rich friend.

717
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,666
She's paying.

718
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,458
I know that Emma
laughed at me.

719
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:27,750
Never hated me or
schemed against me.

720
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,291
They thought nothing of me.

721
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:34,041
And before I knew it,
I agreed with them.

722
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,958
Now I feel different.

723
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,625
Now I'm something, something
strong that can't be

724
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,541
laughed at and ignored.

725
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,666
I am an instrument of power

726
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,833
and now my judgment matters.

727
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,833
They can try and judge me and
neuter everything in my life.

728
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:54,000
And relax, thinking they
have safety in numbers.

729
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:02,541
These spirits sure
bring out the spirits.

730
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,750
What is it?

731
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,375
I just keep, I'm having
the same visions as Jesse.

732
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:16,791
I keep seeing that
clown nut job.

733
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,791
You saw him?

734
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,000
That's who my son's seeing in
his dreams, James Whitmore?

735
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:25,750
Yeah and he's
seeing his Daddy too.

736
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,166
May I ask you something, Abby?

737
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,250
Why was Bob there?

738
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,166
There for a meeting?

739
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,666
Did he have a big speech?

740
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,708
Why was he there?

741
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,125
Yeah, yeah, to talk about guns

742
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,750
and constitutional
rights and stuff.

743
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,791
The girl who owned the
place had some kinda

744
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:49,375
three-tiered event,
a few friends first,

745
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:53,833
then a meeting and
then a big party

746
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,458
with the guys dressed
like clowns and the women

747
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,083
in some kinda wild makeup.

748
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,625
That's how he got in.

749
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:07,958
He just blended right on in
and nobody even noticed him

750
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:10,458
because he was dressed
up like a clown.

751
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,625
If you read the newspapers,
you would know that part.

752
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:17,083
I don't have to read
the newspapers, Abby!

753
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,458
I'm just seein' it!

754
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,583
Just seeing it!

755
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,041
I don't wanna see it.

756
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:34,166
Dad, Dad!

757
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:46,166
Everyone thinks that
the newest thing is crazy

758
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,583
up until they fall
in love with it.

759
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,166
Jesse, it's OK.

760
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,500
It was only a dream.

761
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,250
Oh man, no wonder you're
having nightmares.

762
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,500
Sarah, where are you?

763
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,583
Uh, coming, Abby.

764
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,041
Was I a bad wife?

765
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,791
No!

766
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,208
Why did he have to go to
that stupid crummy horror film?

767
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,958
And that theater birthday party?

768
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,375
And give a speech.

769
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,666
Well maybe he loved
horror films, Abby.

770
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,166
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you're right.

771
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,625
He did love horror films.

772
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,416
How did you know that?

773
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,125
You told me that
when you came in.

774
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:51,791
Well, I love to make
arguments and give speeches.

775
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,416
I didn't know that
he was a karate man

776
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,125
and a homeless people helper.

777
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,000
So weird.

778
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,833
If I had
come home that day,

779
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:10,333
maybe he wouldn't have
gone to that theater.

780
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,875
Maybe you both would've gone
and Jesse would have no one.

781
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,625
-Cheers?
-No.

782
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,916
No. I wouldn't have gone.

783
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,708
I hate horror films.

784
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:32,125
So close, so close.

785
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,000
Ya know what, why don't you
take a swig of that coffee.

786
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,291
Pretend that it's a high
ball or whatever you were

787
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,125
just drinking over at the bar.

788
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,166
How did you know
I was at a bar?

789
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,291
Bottoms up, Abby.

790
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,375
No, no, no.

791
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:52,125
Oh yeah, good.

792
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,541
Uh yuck.

793
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,416
It's coffee!

794
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,083
And that's why you
earn the big bucks.

795
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,333
Can I get ya anything else?

796
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:05,083
Mmm, why the heck not?

797
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,875
You're all right.

798
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,041
You know that, Sarah?

799
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Thank you, I try to be.

800
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,208
I try to be all right too.

801
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,666
Wish I was.

802
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,458
You will be.

803
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,416
You have to give yourself time.

804
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:37,083
Time to cope, maybe even grieve.

805
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,875
There's no deadline
on this Abby.

806
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:42,208
It's Christmas.

807
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,958
It is... almost.

808
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,250
I just want Bob back.

809
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,666
What about his father,

810
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,541
-a certain criminal?

811
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:32,791
A man responsible for
probably many deaths.

812
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:36,416
So then, why should he worry
about letting his father go?

813
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,208
He couldn't be expected
to do everything right.

814
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,166
He couldn't be loyal to
everything all at once.

815
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:45,291
I'll never let my
father go.

816
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:48,333
Mr. Palace, you are
right and wrong

817
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,500
in what you are saying.

818
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,333
My father was not a criminal.

819
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,375
He didn't kill anyone.

820
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,291
There, you are wrong.

821
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,083
But you are right in saying
that I can't be loyal

822
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,708
to everything at once.

823
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:03,375
My loyalty is with my
father only and now,

824
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:07,250
Mr. Palace, I need you to give
me a totally correct lesson,

825
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,375
a very private one too.

826
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:12,416
That's the only kind I do now.

827
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:15,166
Katarina, can
ya give me a minute?

828
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,000
You left your daughter
Aurora right after you

829
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,666
gave her the theater.

830
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,458
You didn't do it on purpose
though, I know that.

831
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:24,333
But, you are in a
beautiful place now.

832
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,166
How is New Jersey?

833
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:30,208
It's not warm
like where you are.

834
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,208
It's cold and it's scary.

835
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,291
Aurora knows for sure
where you are but I,

836
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:37,458
I don't know where
my father is.

837
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,875
Focus.

838
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,875
Streamline it.

839
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:44,250
James Whitmore was the
Security Officer at my school.

840
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,458
He was also the security
officer at your movie theater.

841
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,875
Me and Aurora have a bond.

842
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,333
Why would Whitmore wanna take
our fathers away from us?

843
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,375
Think
about what you need.

844
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:59,250
I need to get my father back.

845
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,541
-Sounds simple.
-No, it's not simple.

846
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:05,250
I need to defeat
Whitmore, but how?

847
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,250
Do you remember how
I taught you to fight?

848
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,791
Our creed?

849
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,500
You never taught me
how to fight, Mr. Palace.

850
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,250
We never even met!

851
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,125
But somehow, I understand
your creed, our creed.

852
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,833
It's loyalty, unconditional
loyalty to the ones

853
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,166
that we love.

854
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,625
Then live it.

855
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:28,291
Modify your officer in
every way that you can,

856
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,416
in every aspect of his life.

857
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,958
The only way I can modify
Whitmore is by getting

858
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:34,375
that black belt.

859
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:37,458
There is a powerful
force guiding me to it.

860
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:41,250
My father was always my teacher
and I was always the student

861
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,125
but now, my father
is my student.

862
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:46,583
I must guide him home.

863
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,375
Your owe your
student your loyalty.

864
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:52,958
And remember, you can't
be expected to be loyal

865
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,958
to everything all at once.

866
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:43,291
Hey Abby, so today,
all applesauce, right?

867
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:46,375
-I told you it's the new Jell-O.
-Perfect.

868
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:49,500
So we meet in ten in the
Eisenhower Conference room.

869
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,458
I thought it was the
Grant Conference room.

870
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,541
You're mixing up your
generals who became presidents.

871
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,875
Right.

872
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,833
Yeah, don't mix
up your applesauces.

873
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,458
-I won't.
-Good,

874
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,083
'cause there's
a big bonus for this one.

875
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,416
Oh, nice picture
of your hubby!

876
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,833
How 'bout a little
holiday spirit, hmm?

877
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,833
Uh, what's that?

878
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,625
Oh, just junk that my
students brought in to me.

879
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,416
I know, I know, it's just yuck.

880
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,875
That is not the way
to get a good grade.

881
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,958
Ya know, if they'd have
brought a bottle of wine,

882
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,833
a little spiked eggnog, maybe
even some glitter makeup.

883
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,916
Uh, we're not
drinking buddies now.

884
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,375
Oh, God, no.

885
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:38,666
You are a total downer
and the worst wingwoman.

886
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,500
Do you know guys just repel
against crying mommies

887
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,041
like bungee jumpers.

888
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,541
I get the message.

889
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,291
We're on track to figuring
something out together, I think.

890
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:54,250
But if you don't mind, I have an
important meeting to get to.

891
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,125
I had another vision, Abby.

892
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:58,041
I was thinking about
your visions this morning.

893
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,791
While all hungover and
with a pounding headache.

894
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,708
It seems you're seeing
things about Bob

895
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,166
and what happened that night.

896
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:12,500
But I came to you to
figure out if he was alive,

897
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,750
like Jesse's saying.

898
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,833
Not much in the evidence
the police found

899
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,958
and not much in your
visions is telling me that.

900
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:22,583
I saw your husband, Abby.

901
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,791
Like in the flesh
or in your head?

902
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,791
I saw where he
would be this morning.

903
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,916
What does that mean, Elizabeth?

904
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:37,333
You just called
me by my first name.

905
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,583
That means we're bonding.

906
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,500
I think I made a
mistake coming to you.

907
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,125
Nothing against you,
Elizabeth, but I started buying

908
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,750
into Jesse's dreams.

909
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,291
And I have some belief
in psychic abilities

910
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,625
and in your ability
specifically.

911
00:50:56,625 --> 00:51:02,916
But, Bob isn't coming back.

912
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:06,583
I brought his picture here
to work with me because...

913
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:09,416
I'm fully accepting that
he's not coming back.

914
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:11,666
And I need to get Jesse
to realize that too.

915
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,541
Maybe Bob is just
coming to Jesse

916
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:20,750
to try to get to you ya know,
in some afterlife thing.

917
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,041
I don't know.

918
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,083
Yeah, maybe or
maybe you and Jesse

919
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,625
are seeing things from the past

920
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,750
or maybe you're just
both good investigators.

921
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,500
We can definitely look at
all options, just later.

922
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,666
Right now, I have to get to
that meeting in this world.

923
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:56,000
Stairs, where's those
stairs when you need them?

924
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:04,458
You wanna talk about
meetings and careers?

925
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,250
Not now, Elizabeth,
another time.

926
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,708
Oh come on, don't you
wanna know why I really

927
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,458
gave up the psychic
biz to be a lawyer?

928
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:11,750
-Nope!
-Er... Law Professor?

929
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,958
No.

930
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,416
'Cause it's a doozy.

931
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,750
No, but I'm sure
that won't stop you.

932
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,791
-Love to chat, gotta run.
-Come on.

933
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,916
Oh no.

934
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:26,541
Isn't it supposed to be the
Eisenhower Conference room?

935
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:27,708
How did you know?

936
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:29,791
I was eavesdropping.

937
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:31,916
God.

938
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:34,500
-I saw my fiancé die.

939
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,666
In a vision.

940
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,666
I saw how we were
gonna get married

941
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,750
and he was gonna die.

942
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:46,166
I've never really even talked
to anybody about this before.

943
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:50,166
I loved him so much,
Abby, that I gave him up.

944
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,500
You didn't marry him?

945
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,708
No, I didn't marry him.

946
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,041
I didn't wanna see him die.

947
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:04,208
I figured if I gave him
up and didn't marry him,

948
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,833
then he won't die and
the spell will be broken.

949
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:09,750
Did it work?

950
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't know.

951
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,375
Maybe.

952
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:14,875
He wouldn't speak to me anymore.

953
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,833
He didn't even
wanna stay in touch

954
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,250
and how could I blame him?

955
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,291
I broke both of our hearts.

956
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:28,500
I mean, part of me doesn't
even wanna know if he's...

957
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,125
alive or dead,
I don't even know.

958
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:33,125
I just threw myself into
law school so that I could

959
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:36,916
become a law professor
and for some people,

960
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:39,375
law school would be
complete torture.

961
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:44,333
But for me, well,
it was a release.

962
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,416
I'm sorry.

963
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:50,666
I'm very sorry, but I have
to get to that meeting.

964
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:54,125
Really? You really wanna
give up your husband

965
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,250
for some stupid bonus?

966
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,875
I don't know what you mean...

967
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,083
and that's not fair.

968
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,750
Take it back!

969
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,625
Whatever it means, take it back.

970
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,083
I can't.

971
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:11,541
I can't take back
what I see, Abby.

972
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,875
Don't you see that you're
losing your own son?

973
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:20,291
Why are you doing this to me?

974
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,083
Why today?

975
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:28,166
Maybe I'm the three
ghosts to your Scrooge

976
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,833
and you are a Scrooge, Abby!

977
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,833
Yesterday, that
was Christmas past.

978
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,208
Today, it's Christmas present.

979
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,125
Where did
you see my husband?

980
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,625
You saw Bob here
at your college?

981
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,833
Yeah, this is definitely,
definitely the place.

982
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,958
A gazebo?

983
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,625
That's a beautiful
Christmas tree.

984
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,333
Sensing something?

985
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,666
No, I'm cold.

986
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:14,791
It's freezing out here.

987
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,083
Look, Elizabeth, this
place is nice and all

988
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:22,916
and festive but why
would Bob come here?

989
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,750
You're here, ain't ya?

990
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,375
You brought me here.

991
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,416
No, no, no, the
spirits brought us here.

992
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,125
Really Elizabeth?

993
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:38,333
You have my mind going back and
forth like a ping pong ball.

994
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:41,708
Really?
My ghost of Christmas present?

995
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:45,083
This is definitely the place.
I know this gazebo.

996
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:47,833
I know that Christmas tree
and that nativity scene.

997
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,291
I even know that
tree right there.

998
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,000
Bob was definitely here.

999
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:58,875
Oh, God, this seat is so cold!

1000
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,666
Bob was standing at that tree.

1001
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:08,000
When?
Yesterday, today?

1002
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,666
Two months ago?

1003
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,166
I don't know, he's
just standing there.

1004
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,916
He's tired out from something.

1005
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,166
Tired?
Okay.

1006
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,458
It was the day
before the shooting.

1007
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,916
And he's here with a
whole lot of other people

1008
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:33,166
and I have this sense of
pride and accomplishment

1009
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:37,458
-from him for something.
-Putting lights on the
Christmas tree?

1010
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:40,583
You are not helping matters.

1011
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,958
I'm not sure if
you are either.

1012
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:45,041
He wanted to
tell you something,

1013
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,458
something about this place.

1014
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:49,166
Tell me what?

1015
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,916
I don't know. He was gonna tell
you when he got home,

1016
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:56,666
when you got home from
work but you were late.

1017
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,833
You're always late,
you're always at work, why?

1018
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,708
It's always been
very busy at work.

1019
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,916
You should've
made the time, Abby.

1020
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,958
Bob always made the time,
didn't he?

1021
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,375
Yeah, okay.

1022
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,541
He was better at the work life
time management stuff.

1023
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,416
He wanted to tell
you about this.

1024
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,208
He wanted you to see this.

1025
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,125
Why?

1026
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,208
Beats me.

1027
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,958
That's it?

1028
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,416
I'm cold,
I'm going to the car.

1029
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:42,083
You dragged me here and
now you wanna get in the car?

1030
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,000
It's got a heater.

1031
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:48,208
I must be nuts.

1032
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:51,000
You're nuts and
the car's locked.

1033
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,125
You locked the car?

1034
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,166
Abby, we're at a nativity scene.

1035
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,791
Ain't nobody out here
and you locked the car?

1036
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:04,375
And you think I'm the one nuts?

1037
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,750
Did you drop something?

1038
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,333
Found something.

1039
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:22,041
Car, heat Abby, car!

1040
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,291
Come on, open the door.

1041
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,583
Is it not opening?

1042
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:33,791
No.

1043
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,625
Oh, my God.

1044
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,625
Heat, Abby.
Come on, I'm cold.

1045
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,708
It takes a while.

1046
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,250
Oh no.

1047
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,500
What is it?

1048
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,708
Another vision?

1049
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,958
Yes.

1050
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,958
Oh come on, give me a break.

1051
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,875
I'm cold and she doesn't care.

1052
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,208
She just wants to get
back to the office.

1053
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:09,083
I care.

1054
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,875
Are you sure, Abby?

1055
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,583
'Cause I don't really know
where this is taking us.

1056
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,625
Lead away.

1057
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,250
Okay but fair warning Abby,

1058
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,666
the psychic GPS stuff,
it goes all over the place.

1059
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,041
There's like wrong turns
and then there's U-turns.

1060
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:23,083
I don't know.

1061
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,750
Let's hit the road, Jack.

1062
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,458
Please just stick to
calling me Elizabeth, okay?

1063
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:27,708
I don't like the name Jack.

1064
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:29,208
It reminds me of
the creepy guy from

1065
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,041
"Jack and the Beanstalk,"
and I don't like

1066
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,708
fairy tales in general.

1067
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:36,125
Like "Hansel and Gretel,"
creepy!

1068
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:39,000
-Who makes up that mess?
-Gotcha.

1069
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,041
Seriously,
kids don't even like it.

1070
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,875
Creepy people, oof.

1071
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,708
Creepy, creepy.

1072
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:48,291
-Hiya, hiya, hiya!

1073
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,583
Hiya, hiya!

1074
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,291
Well, definitely not how
Bob would've done it but,

1075
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,791
I'm kinda good at this.

1076
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:18,166
Nah, this is terrible.

1077
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,125
It's terrible.

1078
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:28,166
Jesse, come in here.

1079
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,041
Jesse?

1080
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,375
Jesse?

1081
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,041
Jesse?

1082
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,583
Jesse!

1083
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,083
Look, Jesse.

1084
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,166
I painted it.

1085
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,250
I painted the birdhouse.

1086
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,500
Oh, so you're
happy I painted it.

1087
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:08,291
Purple, one of my
favorite colors.

1088
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,958
You've earned a lot of belts.

1089
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,541
I'll fix it later.

1090
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:21,833
One more belt?

1091
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,625
Brown?

1092
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,666
Then it's the black belt?

1093
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,666
Uh, Charles, what are
you doing at my desk?

1094
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,208
What happened?

1095
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,416
You missed the entire
meeting yesterday.

1096
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:56,708
Sort of a family
emergency thing.

1097
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:59,208
What is that?
It's awful.

1098
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,333
I painted it for my son.

1099
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:04,208
You should keep
it at the house.

1100
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,250
Charles, what do
you want from me?

1101
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:09,666
What do I want from you?

1102
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:13,166
Well, Janice had to
do the entire pitch.

1103
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:14,666
Well, that's good!

1104
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,791
So the presentation was made.

1105
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:18,625
This is your project.

1106
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,208
Remember, "Applesauce
is the new Jell-O."

1107
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,500
-That was your idea.
-Janice is more than competent.

1108
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,750
I'm sure she handled
it perfectly.

1109
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,291
That's not the point.

1110
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,291
My work was in there, right?

1111
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,791
And the client is happy?

1112
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,875
You can't miss
critical meetings.

1113
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:42,625
It's a tough time.

1114
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:45,083
It's Christmas.

1115
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:50,291
Holidays are rough
for lots of people.

1116
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:55,958
Like me and my son?

1117
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:58,625
How many other people lost
their husband last Christmas?

1118
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:01,958
It's just that usually,
you're the most...

1119
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:04,041
"work-is-first person" I know.

1120
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,166
You know, you're
absolutely right.

1121
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,791
Can I ask you a question?

1122
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,958
Of course.

1123
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,750
Have you ever felt like
you missed something?

1124
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,875
Like what?

1125
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,250
Like life?

1126
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,916
Shake hands.

1127
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:57,958
So, Frosty the Snowman,
he's completely had it by now

1128
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,750
'cause of all the salt
and the sand coming up.

1129
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,250
And the soot's blackening
his pretty white coat.

1130
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,208
It's bad enough that some
big ol' blackbird came along

1131
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,416
and chomped off part of
his carrot nose to eat it

1132
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:13,416
and he lost one of his
black pieces of coal
out of his eye.

1133
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:17,125
So now he's got one eye and
half a nose and his whole body

1134
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:20,916
is meltin' faster
than it should.

1135
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:27,458
See, salt and sand is
hazardous waste to Frosty.

1136
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:30,208
But, for the community,
the salt and the sand

1137
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,000
is really good.

1138
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,250
It's good for keeping the
streets and the sidewalks safe.

1139
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:42,500
So, does Frosty have a
legitimate valid lawsuit?

1140
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,916
Now I want you to put
your thinking caps on.

1141
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,791
Come on, I need some
Christmas future advice.

1142
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:48,500
It's Christmas Eve day
and I'm right in the middle

1143
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,708
of an important lecture.

1144
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:53,708
What Professor lectures
on Christmas Eve day?

1145
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:56,291
And who to?

1146
01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:00,000
Well, these students are
in North Sentinel Island.

1147
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,625
It's that island off
of India, ya know,

1148
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,625
where they shoot people
with bows and arrows.

1149
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:07,166
Not sure what their
Christmas plans are.

1150
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,000
What are your Christmas plans?

1151
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,208
Sorry.

1152
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,750
What'd you do that for?

1153
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,916
I'm trying to teach
them international law

1154
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,458
and they are a real
lawless bunch, you know?

1155
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:23,791
You started this.

1156
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,875
You have to help me finish it.

1157
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,208
I hope I have
this number still.

1158
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,250
Nope.

1159
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,625
Ow!

1160
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,250
You managed to direct me away

1161
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:37,791
from a very important
meeting and it did me good.

1162
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,541
I feel like we're close.

1163
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,041
You feel like we're close?

1164
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,333
I love that.

1165
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:58,125
Ya know, there are
times I'm afraid.

1166
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,916
Afraid I'm making
the wrong choice,

1167
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,500
going down the wrong path.

1168
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,083
Just need to hold this,
fire it at the firing range

1169
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,791
a few times.

1170
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:12,916
It reminds me of what
you've taught me.

1171
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,458
What did he teach me?

1172
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,750
Who?

1173
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,916
James Whitmore,
what did he teach me?

1174
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,583
What did he teach you?

1175
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:25,125
I don't know, the
guy's a crazy idiot!

1176
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,041
You're stronger than
all of us put together.

1177
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,166
Aurora, Daddy's little girl.

1178
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,875
I need you to figure this out.

1179
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,000
Daddy, help me to help you!

1180
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,083
We can start to help.

1181
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,916
You must watch for
yourself, Aurora.

1182
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:49,333
You all must watch
for yourselves.

1183
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,791
Unless he stops us.

1184
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:54,000
Some is as it
seems, some is not.

1185
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,875
This is me and this is real.

1186
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:01,125
But if I'm not here,
not exactly here,

1187
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,416
then I'm not real.

1188
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,916
Aurora, you woke up.

1189
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,000
Thank God.

1190
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,166
Oh!

1191
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:24,666
Abby, I need some whiskey.

1192
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,958
I need bourbon or I
just need a drink now.

1193
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,541
What?
What did you see, Elizabeth?

1194
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:34,000
I saw a whole lot more than
I wanted to see, believe me.

1195
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:39,375
Is that... that
Aurora lady,

1196
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,958
was she in the hospital
after the shooting?

1197
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,916
Yeah, I think so.

1198
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,041
She wasn't shot but I think
she went to the hospital, yeah.

1199
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,791
Why?

1200
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,916
'Cause I saw your husband
there with her in the hospital.

1201
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:55,166
That can't be.
He disappeared with Whitmore.

1202
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:58,500
Like seconds after the shooting.

1203
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,333
I don't know, it's just
like a big old jumbled mess.

1204
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:04,583
I don't know if it's from
the past or the present

1205
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:09,333
or the future or maybe
some... other place.

1206
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,666
What it does tell me though,

1207
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:15,625
by seeing a vision of
Bob in the hospital,

1208
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,250
it tells me that he's alive.

1209
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,583
You think he's alive?

1210
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,000
You really think
Bob could be alive?

1211
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,541
Yes, I do.
I really do think he's alive.

1212
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:37,916
But uh, we need to
go back to that bar.

1213
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:43,458
We need to go back to that bar.
The Christmas future is there.

1214
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:45,250
And I need a drink.

1215
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,416
Okay.

1216
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:50,125
You gonna go to
the bar with me?

1217
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,791
Of course I'm gonna go!

1218
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,041
All right, well you're buyin'.

1219
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,500
Okay.

1220
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:14,958
Those Sentinel Islands students
that you cut me off from,

1221
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,416
they're not like the
rest of the world.

1222
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,791
The government doesn't
even let you get within

1223
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:24,208
50 miles of them and they
don't even tolerate outsiders.

1224
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:29,916
We've been here nearly
an hour, Elizabeth.

1225
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:34,291
My days at a bar on
Christmas Eve are long gone.

1226
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:38,541
I wanna get home to
Jesse but you said

1227
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,375
my Christmas future is here.

1228
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:49,583
It might've been my Christmas
future, not yours Abby.

1229
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,500
Mark?

1230
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,458
Elizabeth?

1231
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,750
Mark, you're alive?

1232
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,541
Of course I'm alive.

1233
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:07,625
You upset me, but uh...
you didn't kill me.

1234
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:13,166
Mark, it's been
almost 20 years!

1235
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:16,750
My apologies for
breaking up the reunion.

1236
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:20,291
But let me guess,
you're Mark's ex fiancée?

1237
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:24,625
Yes, and you're his wife?

1238
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,291
Mark told me that
you were psychic.

1239
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:29,833
No it's just that obvious.

1240
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:36,083
Well look, it is Christmas Eve,
so, excuse me for

1241
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:40,916
being rude but uh,
we gotta get home to our son.

1242
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:44,166
Huh, lot of people seem
to be saying that lately.

1243
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,916
Well, bye.

1244
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,958
Merry Christmas.

1245
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,583
Yeah, Merry Christmas,
Elizabeth.

1246
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:54,833
Merry Christmas to y'all.

1247
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,916
That was your ex fiancée!

1248
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,125
He's alive, that's great news!

1249
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,375
Not for you!

1250
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,625
What?

1251
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,500
Why?

1252
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,666
Bartender, two Johnny Walker
shots please, immediately!

1253
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:36,625
In my visions, I always
saw that Mark was dead

1254
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,708
and that Bob was alive.

1255
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,916
Mark's alive, I can't
even believe he's alive.

1256
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:52,375
But if Mark's alive,
then that means Bob,

1257
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,250
he's probably...

1258
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:01,708
This is terrible.

1259
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:04,833
I mean, it's happy
for you but it's,

1260
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,375
it's not what I was
expecting for me and Jesse.

1261
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,125
We can start to help.

1262
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,583
That sounded like Bob's voice!

1263
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,791
That's exactly what I
heard Bob say in my vision.

1264
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:23,916
Bob?

1265
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,375
Bob!

1266
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,541
Bob!

1267
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,666
Bob?

1268
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,125
Bob?

1269
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,625
What, what is it?

1270
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:35,958
Oh, the women's room occupied?

1271
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:40,291
I'm so sorry, we thought
you were someone else.

1272
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:54,000
Abby, I want you to know I'm
really, really, really sorry.

1273
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,541
My visions, they ain't perfect.

1274
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,333
And I think I'm just seeing
all of the good things

1275
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,208
that Bob did and maybe that's
what he wanted you to see,

1276
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,000
all the good things and
he wanted you and Jesse

1277
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,750
to know that he's
OK wherever he is.

1278
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:17,500
I do know that he's definitely
watching over you, OK?

1279
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,500
What you've done for me
and Jesse is wonderful.

1280
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,791
I haven't done anything.

1281
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,791
Bob isn't coming back.

1282
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:33,875
I know that now.

1283
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:39,041
Yes, he is here.

1284
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:44,666
He's left us with something
so very special, his love,

1285
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:48,541
to us and to so
many other people.

1286
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:52,333
And you truly helped
me realize that.

1287
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:54,166
And you helped me realize
that my life with Jesse

1288
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:58,458
is so much more important
than anything else.

1289
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:01,083
There was nothing more
important to Bob than Jesse.

1290
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:06,916
I am so happy that
you see that, Abby.

1291
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,500
And I want you to know
something else.

1292
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,041
You really are a good mama.
I do see that. I want you
to know that.

1293
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:20,541
I may be just a little
bit jealous 'cause I
don't have a kid,

1294
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:24,375
but I do see that you
are a very good mama.

1295
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:30,291
Would you like to
come by to my house

1296
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,208
for Christmas Eve dinner?

1297
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,958
I can promise you
it will be good

1298
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,708
because my parents made it.

1299
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:38,375
Really appreciate that
invite more than you

1300
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:43,416
will ever understand,
but I actually do have a family.

1301
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,666
My mama and daddy are
here from West Virginia.

1302
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:48,375
So I'm going home to them.

1303
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,750
Well, would you be able to
come by tomorrow afternoon

1304
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,000
when Jesse's scheduled to
get his self-dealt black belt?

1305
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,333
I could use all the
support I can with that.

1306
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:03,500
I will absolutely be there.
I promise you.

1307
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,208
Thank you, Elizabeth.

1308
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,708
Merry Christmas, Abby.

1309
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,958
Merry Christmas, Elizabeth.

1310
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:15,125
Come on, let's go home.

1311
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:30,333
Your mother and I are
very proud of Jesse, right?

1312
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,583
Awe, that's so sweet.

1313
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:35,166
I mean, honestly,
I don't know how he does it.

1314
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:40,666
Plus the energy that he's
putting into this project.

1315
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,291
Ah, amazing.

1316
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:46,250
Clearly we all need the
amount of energy Jesse has.

1317
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,791
My God, he's got
so much energy, that kid.

1318
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:53,166
I don't know where he gets it.

1319
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:54,500
People used to, though...

1320
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,125
They did, I know, right?

1321
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,625
It's so funny.

1322
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:03,083
When you break this board,
you'll speak?

1323
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:06,250
Do you want me
to hold the board?

1324
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,166
I would like to
hold the board.

1325
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,541
How 'bout you, Professor, would
you like to hold the board?

1326
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:12,833
Me?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1327
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:14,750
Looking at Jesse,
he might break my fingers

1328
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,333
along with that board, mm-mmm.

1329
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,708
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1330
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:21,041
I think a man needs
to hold that board.

1331
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:24,250
What do you mean?
A woman can hold a board
just as well as a man.

1332
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,791
Mom. Dad.

1333
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,041
I'm going to hold
the boards for Jesse.

1334
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:35,875
OK, Jesse, you're supposed to
break this with one hit, right?

1335
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,125
So give it your best shot.

1336
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,083
Way to go, Jesse!

1337
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,083
All right, Jesse! Way to go!

1338
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,041
My dear God!

1339
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:58,166
All right!
Way to go, Jesse! All right!

1340
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,500
Dear God!

1341
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,625
Dad, Dad!

1342
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,000
You escaped!
I knew you would!

1343
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,083
I did. I escaped.

1344
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:11,125
Well, OK,
guess I was on target.

1345
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:13,250
I'm home! I'm home!

1346
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,625
Come here.

1347
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:24,041
You did this for me, didn't you?

1348
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,125
I did so that you
would come home.

1349
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:30,166
You're a black belt, Jesse.

1350
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,541
You're a black belt.

1351
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:33,916
You earned it.

1352
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,666
Come here.

1353
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,041
It's a miracle.

1354
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,708
It's a true Christmas miracle.
