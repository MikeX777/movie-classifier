1
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
Dear God.

2
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
Please help your servant.

3
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,440
I wish someone would help me
get my telescope.

4
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,680
If it's a woman,

5
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,040
I will make her my sister
for the rest of my life.

6
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,720
If it turns out to be a man,

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
I will make him my husband.

8
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,120
Here's your telescope, miss.

9
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,840
Lengser. You.

10
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,440
Yes, it's me.

11
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Did you listen to what I was saying?

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes, I did.

13
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,880
Sanghyang Rumuhun

14
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,480
has fulfilled your wish.

15
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
You're my soulmate.

16
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,440
Please accept this.

17
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,320
This is destiny.

18
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,600
Humans aren't supposed to refuse it.

19
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
Come on.

20
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
Welcome, Gusti Prabu.

21
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
Pardon me, Gusti Prabu.

22
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,920
I have prepared the coconuts.
The ones you love, Your Highness.

23
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,160
Well done, Lengser.

24
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
You know what I like, right?

25
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,240
Take off your hood.

26
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Lift up your face.

27
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
Kanjeng Adipati.

28
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Pardon me, Prabu. We just got news
that Dayang Sumbi is pregnant.

29
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
What? Dayang Sumbi is pregnant?

30
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,720
Dammit!

31
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,440
Sumbi, is this how you repay
your father's kindness?

32
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Despicable. You have humiliated me

33
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,920
and shamed this kingdom.

34
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Please forgive me, dearest father.

35
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,040
Sumbi, tell me who stained your chastity.

36
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,000
Tell me!

37
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,080
I have asked you many times.

38
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Answer me!

39
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
Just tell us, my granddaughter.

40
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,320
Whatever social class the man is,

41
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,400
your father will act fairly
in this regard.

42
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,720
All right, then.
If you choose to keep silent,

43
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,960
don't regret my decision.

44
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
- Bikalpa!
- Yes, Gusti.

45
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
Come here.

46
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
Chop off her head!

47
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,080
Have mercy, Gusti.

48
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,400
Please have mercy, Gusti Prabu.

49
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm the one who did
the despicable thing to her.

50
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
I have done you wrong.

51
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
Please have mercy on me, Gusti Prabu.

52
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Are you telling the truth, Lengser?

53
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,440
Yes. I'm telling the truth, Gusti Prabu.

54
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
I can't believe it.

55
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,000
You're my loyal and most trusted adjutant,

56
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,840
but you dare to insult me.

57
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,360
Curse you!

58
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Please forgive me, Gusti Prabu.

59
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,800
Please have mercy on me, Gusti.

60
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,560
Have mercy, Gusti.

61
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,240
Stop! Please stop it, Father!

62
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,880
It wasn't all his fault!

63
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,160
Bikalpa!

64
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,920
Take care of them.

65
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
Wait!

66
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,000
My son, Prabu Sungging Purbangkara,
don't do anything foolish.

67
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,680
Because after all, Sumbi is your daughter,
your own flesh and blood.

68
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,280
Even though her mother,
Dayang Wulan, passed away,

69
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,480
and you never established her
as the empress.

70
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
Remember this, Sungging.

71
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
The baby who will also die in her womb

72
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,720
is your innocent grandchild.

73
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,080
I truly uphold your wisdom, Mother,
but this disgrace is too much for me.

74
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,040
No, this reality is Hyang Rumuhun's will.

75
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,680
What should I do, then?

76
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,200
Marry them

77
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,920
and give your grandchild
a chance to be born.

78
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Because of your request, Mother,
I will do it.

79
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,640
Listen, Lengser.

80
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,520
I will let you marry my daughter.

81
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,760
But I still can't accept
your dog-like behavior.

82
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Have mercy on us, Father.

83
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,920
Please have mercy on us.

84
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,760
You have to leave this castle.
I don't want to see your face.

85
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,560
Mother!

86
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,960
Take a look, Mother! Come and take a look.

87
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,640
I brought you a rabbit this time.

88
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Please take it, Mother.

89
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Jaka Sona, my son.

90
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm so proud. Every time
you come home, you bring me game.

91
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,800
But sometimes, I worry.

92
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,240
Worry? What worries you, Mother?

93
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,360
You're bold going into the forest
by yourself.

94
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,560
The forest has become my world.

95
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
It's your world too.

96
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,720
Why should I be afraid?
I have Tumang by my side.

97
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,040
Life in the jungle is fierce.

98
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
We could live a wonderful life

99
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,520
if only you still had a father.

100
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
A father?

101
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,080
You told me that Father has left Earth.

102
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,520
That's true, my son.

103
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,400
Your father died heroically
on the battlefield.

104
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,440
Poor Father.

105
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,080
It's the will of Sanghyang Rumuhun.

106
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Let it go, Mother.

107
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
Mother.

108
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,360
Tumang always takes care of me.

109
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,040
To me, he's my best friend

110
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,960
and also a father.

111
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
Jaka.

112
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,560
Mother!

113
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,760
It's me, Jaka!

114
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,480
I'm here, Mother!

115
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,440
My goodness, Jaka! Get down from the tree.

116
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,840
Wait a second, Mother.
I will bring you lots of firewood.

117
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,680
Enough. That's enough, Jaka!

118
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,120
Yes, Mother! I'm coming down!

119
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,520
Mother, look at me! I will jump from here.

120
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,000
Look at me!

121
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
Mom! Here you go.

122
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
All living things,

123
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,200
including animals,
their birth in this world was solely

124
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,720
by the will of Sanghyang Rumuhun.

125
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,400
It's the same with our births.

126
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,320
Everything is his destiny.

127
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,120
So, in this life, we have to surrender?

128
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,240
Indeed, but we can't give up.

129
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,000
We have to endure this life
despite the bad luck we suffered.

130
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,640
What bad luck you got, poor Tumang.

131
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,520
What's wrong with Tumang, Mother?

132
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,560
I feel sorry for his fate.

133
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,920
Why do you feel sorry for him?

134
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,640
Even though Tumang is a dog,

135
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
he's more loyal than any human.

136
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,920
Hey. Are you crying, Mother?

137
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,560
What does a dog's loyalty mean, Mother?

138
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,960
I'm Jaka, Mother.

139
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
Jaka Sona, your son,

140
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,960
who will be loyal and love you forever.

141
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
That was so touching, Son.

142
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm so proud of you, Son.

143
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,400
Jaka.

144
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm craving a deer's heart.

145
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,680
- Do you want one, Mother?
- Yes.

146
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,400
I will look for one right now.

147
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
Tumang!

148
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,040
Let's find a deer for Mother.

149
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm leaving now.

150
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,840
Don't be loud.

151
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
Tumang, there's a deer over there.

152
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,600
Try to bring it here.

153
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,880
Let's go.

154
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Why are you coming back?

155
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,520
We've got to bring
the deer's heart for Mother. Come on.

156
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,480
Come on!

157
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,600
Are you lazy? Off you go! Let's go.

158
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,760
If you don't want to go,
I will shoot you with an arrow.

159
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,320
Go! Let's go!

160
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,120
Tumang!

161
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,960
Tumang!

162
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Tumang?

163
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,640
Your mother wants a deer's heart, right?

164
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,880
Draw your knife before I die.

165
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,360
Hurry up.

166
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,800
Hurry up, Sona.

167
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
Do it.

168
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Quick. Do it.

169
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,840
Mother!

170
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,080
Mother!

171
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
- Mother.
- Hey, you did it, Jaka!

172
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,080
- Mother.
- What's the matter, Jaka?

173
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,800
I can't understand you.
Tell me. What's going on?

174
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,240
I brought you the heart...

175
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
of Tumang, Mother.

176
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,840
What?

177
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,360
Tumang's heart?

178
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,840
I accidentally shot Tumang, Mother.

179
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,360
- He died and transformed into...
- My goodness.

180
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,280
Please forgive me, Mother.

181
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
You killed Tumang, Jaka.

182
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
He's your own flesh and blood.

183
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,600
- Murderer!
- Forgive me!

184
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,080
Have mercy on me, Mother!

185
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,040
I really regret it, Mother!

186
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,080
Forgive me!

187
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,400
Ouch! I'm terribly sorry!

188
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,160
- Such an insolent child!
- Forgive me!

189
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,720
I didn't mean it, Mother.

190
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
Crazy kid!

191
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Forgive me!

192
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,000
- I didn't mean it!
- Such an ungrateful child. Get lost!

193
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,080
- No, Mother!
- Go away from here! Get lost!

194
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,400
A terrible child! Get lost!

195
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
- Get lost!
- Please forgive me, Mother.

196
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Get lost!

197
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,320
Jaka.

198
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,080
My goodness.

199
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,960
Jaka!

200
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,200
Jaka!

201
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,560
Jaka!

202
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Jaka...

203
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,040
<i>Hey, human boy.</i>

204
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,040
<i>You have apparently been sent by the gods</i>

205
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,480
<i>to live with us.</i>

206
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
<i>What's your name?</i>

207
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Jaka Sona.

208
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,320
I've been kicked out of my house.

209
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
I got lost.

210
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,320
Let me take shelter in this place.

211
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,840
<i>You may live here.</i>

212
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,400
<i>Live here with Guriang.</i>

213
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,120
Guriang?

214
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,680
<i>Indeed. Guriang means the force of nature</i>

215
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,520
<i>that you will receive
during your stay here.</i>

216
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,680
<i>We will make you into one mighty human.</i>

217
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Is that true?

218
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,360
- <i>Indeed.</i>
- I'm willing, then.

219
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,200
Thank you.

220
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
My son,

221
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,640
before I go,

222
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,880
I really want to see and hold
my great-grandchild.

223
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,240
The child of Sumbi.

224
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,920
Twelve years is such a long time
to redeem her oversight.

225
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,120
Please call them back to this castle.

226
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
Forgive them.

227
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Mother, that ship has sailed.
Don't keep thinking about that.

228
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,720
Sumbi has done a really terrible thing.

229
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,120
And what about your behavior?

230
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,920
When will you change
your habit of philandering?

231
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,200
Do you still insist
on not finding an empress?

232
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,920
You're my everything, Mother.

233
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,760
My love for you

234
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
can't be shared with other women.

235
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,600
My son,

236
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,520
a boy's love for his mother

237
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,280
is different from his love for his wife.

238
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Haven't you thought about
who will replace you

239
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,520
to lead this kingdom in the future?

240
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,200
If you haven't, find Sumbi,

241
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,560
and train your grandson
to become the crown prince.

242
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,200
Please forgive me.

243
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,520
Allow me to not answer that.
Just this once.

244
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
Sungging.

245
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm worried that karma will punish you.

246
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,880
<i>Jaka Sona, the human son.</i>

247
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,640
<i>Nine years have passed.</i>

248
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,680
<i>Your existence as a hermit is finished.
You have become superior.</i>

249
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,960
<i>In your body reside the</i> guriangs.

250
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,960
<i>Your body is the vessel,
or "Sangkur" Guriang.</i>

251
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,080
<i>You have the right
to bear the name "Sangkuriang."</i>

252
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,400
<i>Your name is now Sangkuriang.</i>

253
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,720
<i>Now, leave this place.</i>

254
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,520
<i>Leave this place with an honest soul.</i>

255
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,840
<i>A lot of people will be needing you.</i>

256
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,120
<i>Farewell.</i>

257
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,960
Let them out of the stable.

258
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,560
Open the gate!

259
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,880
Take all of them.

260
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,800
Let us go!

261
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,280
How insolent!

262
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,720
Have mercy, please, mister.

263
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,960
She's my only grandchild.

264
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,680
Don't take her away.

265
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,720
Do you dare to oppose your own Prabu?

266
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,560
Have pity on us, mister.

267
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,320
- Have mercy.
- Silence!

268
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,760
One more word,
and I'll chop off your head.

269
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,480
- No, mister. Please.
- Let's go.

270
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,720
- Help, Grandpa!
- My grandchild!

271
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,040
Endah!

272
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Endah, my granddaughter!

273
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,560
My poor grandchild!

274
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,320
Be strong, Gramps.

275
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,280
Give all of your crops to us. Hurry!

276
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,160
Come on!

277
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,800
What's going on in this village?

278
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
My grandchild...

279
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,120
Brother, I sometimes worry

280
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,760
that Gusti Prabu will find out about
our infamous ways with the subjects.

281
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,960
If we don't do these things,
we won't be rich.

282
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,480
Gusti Prabu only pays attention
to the young ladies.

283
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,680
That's what's important.

284
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,160
Kanjeng Adipati,
we've completed our tasks.

285
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,520
Well done. Assign them.

286
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,640
Listen up, all of you.

287
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,440
All the animals and harvests,
bring them to Kepatihan,

288
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,520
and all the young ladies,
take them to Keraton.

289
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
- Let's move, now.
- Wait!

290
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,120
All the women, harvests,
and animals must stay here!

291
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,480
It doesn't belong to the kingdom.

292
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,680
I'm warning you all

293
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,560
to leave this village immediately.

294
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,600
How dare you oppose Gusti Prabu's orders?

295
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
What's your name?

296
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Sangkuriang.

297
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,400
Take care of him.

298
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,200
Chase him.

299
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,720
Surround him.

300
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,280
Surround him.

301
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
Stop!

302
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,240
Do as I told you or else!

303
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,440
Hurry up! Leave!

304
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,400
Forgive me, Kanjeng Adipati.

305
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,400
I have been rude to you.

306
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,080
You may leave.

307
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,360
Thank you for your help, son.

308
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,800
But this could be the start
of a huge disaster for this village.

309
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,920
Why?

310
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,200
Gusti Prabu will destroy us all.

311
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,160
If I'm guilty

312
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,160
of defending justice,

313
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,000
then let me bear it.

314
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,480
But justice is not ours.

315
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,720
It doesn't belong to this village.

316
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,040
Justice is in the hands of Gusti Prabu.

317
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,040
Then I will take it away from Gusti Prabu.

318
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>Mother! Take a look, Mother!</i>

319
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,760
<i>I brought you a rabbit this time.</i>

320
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,920
<i>Take it, Mother.</i>

321
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,880
<i>Jaka Sona, my son.</i>

322
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,680
<i>I'm always proud to receive
your game meat.</i>

323
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
Mother!

324
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,840
Mother!

325
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,240
Mother!

326
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,400
Mother!

327
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,080
Please forgive me, Mother.

328
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,240
Cowards!

329
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,320
You're all lily-livered.

330
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
Who's the young man who dares disobey?

331
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,720
Sangkuriang.

332
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,480
Sangkuriang?

333
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,840
Indeed, Gusti Prabu.

334
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,680
How will you take care of this problem?

335
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,080
What should we do?

336
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,520
- That's right.
- Let's find another way.

337
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,520
We must think about this.

338
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,040
You're all fools.

339
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,040
Catch Sangkuriang. Bring him to me.

340
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,720
Dead or alive.

341
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,440
If anyone helps him,

342
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,440
you can burn them too.

343
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,400
Do it!

344
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,560
We will follow your orders.

345
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,520
Open it!

346
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,800
Sangkuriang, come out of the cage.
Prove to us that you're a champion.

347
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,120
Come out, you water rat.

348
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,240
All right. I have a way to force you out.

349
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,640
Spear him!

350
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,480
Show me what you've got.

351
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,120
I want to find out
who'll win this contest.

352
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,600
No!

353
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,760
Who will die between us.

354
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,440
Curse you!

355
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,320
Pursue and seize him!

356
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Let's go! Surround him!

357
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,840
Who are you? Why are you hiding there?

358
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,760
Don't speak too loud.

359
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,320
My name is Sangkuriang.

360
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,960
The Keraton people are hunting me.

361
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,120
Why? You must be an outlaw.

362
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,000
No. I'm not an outlaw.

363
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,200
Instead, I'm against their tyranny.

364
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,000
What tyranny?

365
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,880
The people sincerely accept
the way they are treated.

366
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,400
Miss, your voice and your face
remind me of someone.

367
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,280
Enough. You look so tired.
Please, have a drink.

368
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,520
Thank you.

369
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,640
Check all the houses.

370
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,640
Don't give that scumbag
any chance to escape.

371
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,640
If necessary, arrest all
the suspicious people in the village.

372
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Do it!

373
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,720
Spread out.

374
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,560
Go and hide inside. I will go see them.

375
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,400
- Why are you helping me?
- I'm not helping you.

376
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,720
I'm helping myself.

377
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,320
Miss.

378
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,640
You're beautiful and so kind.

379
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,600
Excuse me!

380
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,840
Hurry up. Hide.

381
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
Everyone who's in this house, get out!

382
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,800
Quick!

383
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,280
What's going on, sir?

384
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,720
Excuse me, miss.
We're looking for a fugitive from Keraton.

385
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,480
His name is Sangkuriang.

386
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,400
Is he here?

387
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,920
No, mister. I'm all alone.

388
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,480
Let's search this house. Let's go.

389
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,000
Don't, sir. There's no one inside.

390
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,720
Don't argue with us.
We're just following orders.

391
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,000
Step aside!

392
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,240
- No, don't!
- Stop!

393
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,520
Greetings, miss.

394
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,360
I'm so happy to meet Miss Dayang Sumbi.

395
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,480
What do you mean, Kanjeng Adipati?

396
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,960
I never expected you to live
in this village, miss.

397
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,200
Miss, Gusti Prabu is your father.

398
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,280
He misses you so much.

399
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,320
He will be so happy to know about this.

400
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,480
You're mistaken, Kanjeng Adipati.

401
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,720
Both my parents have passed away.

402
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,520
I'm not Dayang Sumbi.

403
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,120
I don't think so.

404
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
You're Dayang Sumbi for sure.

405
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,400
I don't know that name.

406
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,400
I was born and raised in this village.

407
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,960
My name is Larasati.

408
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,560
Whether you're Dayang Sumbi or Larasati,
it makes no difference to me.

409
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,720
I will inform Gusti Prabu
about this immediately.

410
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,400
Everyone, leave this place.

411
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,960
Let's go.

412
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,200
Miss.

413
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,080
It looks like they suspected you.

414
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,800
Why was that?

415
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,560
It's such a bad sign for me.
I should leave.

416
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,800
I've become troublesome for you.

417
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,240
Please forgive me.

418
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,920
I don't blame anyone.

419
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,320
It looks like
they will do something to me.

420
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,400
You saved my life.

421
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,360
Now it's my turn to protect you.

422
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,280
What do you mean?

423
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,840
The Almighty has fated us
to meet each other

424
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,240
and also to share that fate.

425
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,120
<i>Dayang Sumbi?</i>

426
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,720
Are you sure it's my daughter?

427
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,480
That's right, Gusti Prabu.

428
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
My daughter.

429
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,720
I've been longing to see her again.

430
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,600
Miss Dayang Sumbi hasn't aged at all.

431
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,800
She looks the same as when she left.

432
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,000
Ki Patih.

433
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,080
I order you to fetch her immediately.

434
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
Yes, Gusti Prabu.

435
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,520
<i>How peaceful my heart will be</i>

436
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,440
<i>if this young man
really wants to be my protector.</i>

437
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,560
- <i>But...</i>
- Miss!

438
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,160
Miss Larasati!

439
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,840
Did you catch a fish?

440
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,400
Not yet.

441
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,080
Here you go.

442
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,280
Mother! Here you go!

443
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,880
I'm so sorry, miss.
Please get me my clothes over there.

444
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,160
Hurry up, miss.

445
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm so cold, miss.

446
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,600
Close your eyes.

447
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,720
What's the matter?

448
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,560
Do you regret it, miss?

449
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm afraid of my past.

450
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,000
I'm scared of losing
the one I love for the second time.

451
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,920
Stop worrying, miss.

452
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,240
I will always be by your side.

453
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,040
Live for love, love to live.

454
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,160
<i>Living in this nation is so unfair.</i>

455
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,440
<i>The people are always victims
of extortion.</i>

456
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,600
<i>That's because of all the deeds
of Kanjeng Adipati,</i>

457
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,160
<i>led by Prabu Sungging Perbangkara.</i>

458
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,720
My dream of liberating this nation

459
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,920
will never end.

460
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,840
What's the matter, miss?

461
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,840
As a mighty warrior,
you won't ever get hurt.

462
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,160
But I found a scar on your head.

463
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,720
What caused it?

464
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,400
It happened when I was a child.

465
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,160
I accidentally killed our dear dog.

466
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,720
My mother was furious,

467
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,480
and she hit me on the head.

468
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,520
Sangkuriang.

469
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,760
I have a feeling about you.

470
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm worried that you're my...

471
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,400
You don't have to be worried.

472
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,200
Sangkuriang is here.

473
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,360
The man who will love
and protect you forever.

474
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,240
Jaka is here, Mother.

475
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,000
Jaka Sona, your son.

476
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,320
The one who will love
and protect you forever, Mother.

477
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,680
Miss, you should go home, to the palace.

478
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,040
We brought horses to fetch you, miss.

479
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,680
Don't waste your time with this infidel.

480
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,600
Step aside, Sangkuriang!

481
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,320
Allow us to take the woman.

482
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,840
Don't touch her!

483
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,120
Never mind kidnapping.

484
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,160
I'm her guardian.

485
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,720
Curse you, kid!

486
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,560
Seize that scum! And search the house.

487
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,240
Kanjeng Adipati,
we can't find Dayang Sumbi.

488
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,960
Search the whole village
until you find her.

489
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,160
Yes, Kanjeng Adipati.

490
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,520
Do it!

491
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,400
Chase him.

492
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,960
Get him.

493
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,720
Drag and burn him!

494
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,160
Let's go.

495
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,600
Drag him.

496
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,280
Keep dragging him.

497
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,840
Let's go outside.

498
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,920
- Come on!
- Wait for me. Mister.

499
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,400
Bring him in.

500
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,920
Burn the house down.

501
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,520
Everyone, leave this place. Come on.

502
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,600
Pardon me, Gusti Prabu.

503
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,520
I come to demand justice and truth.

504
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,720
What kind of justice
and truth are you demanding?

505
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,120
You have never taken care of your people.

506
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,520
And you don't know

507
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,480
what your two greedy Patih
have been doing all along.

508
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,720
They have been robbing your people

509
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,320
while the king was absorbed
in the pleasure of women.

510
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
Such a cocky kid!

511
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,280
You have guts to insult me.

512
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,360
And also my men.

513
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,520
Kill him!

514
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,000
Chase him!

515
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,400
Miss Larasati.

516
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,200
Miss.

517
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,240
Miss!

518
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,080
Miss Larasati?

519
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,360
What do you mean by all this?

520
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,560
Don't call me miss, Jaka Sona.

521
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,320
How do you know my childhood name?

522
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,320
Because I'm actually your mother.

523
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,760
I gave birth to you and raised you.

524
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,560
Impossible.

525
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,320
My mother passed away.

526
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,960
I buried her body.

527
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,400
I'm Dayang Sumbi.

528
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,760
Lies!

529
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,320
You look like her,

530
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,120
but you're not my mother.

531
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,120
Adipati from the palace
mistook you for Dayang Sumbi, too,

532
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,840
but you told them that you are not her.

533
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,520
Do you remember that?

534
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,720
I just made that up

535
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,680
to protect myself from them.

536
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Why did you do that?

537
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,760
Now you don't have to worry anymore.

538
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,360
I killed them all.

539
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,440
Come on.

540
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,960
I'm ready to marry you.

541
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,320
No way. How can a mother marry her child?

542
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,040
You're not my mother.

543
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,000
I have to marry you, whatever it takes.

544
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,440
<i>My Lord.</i>

545
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,080
<i>Please free me from this suffering.</i>

546
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,800
<i>Please help me, Lord.</i>

547
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,080
If I am really your son,

548
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,640
please tell me. Who's my real father?

549
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:33,960
All right.

550
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,320
Your real father is...

551
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,360
You can't tell me, right?

552
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,880
Because you're not my mother.

553
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,920
All right, Sangkuriang.

554
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,160
I give up.

555
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,920
For what you demand,

556
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,200
you need to do as I ask.

557
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,440
What is it? Tell me.

558
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,800
Make a dam in the Citarum River,

559
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,080
transform the valley into a lake,

560
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,880
and make a boat for us to sail on it.

561
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,840
Is that everything?

562
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,320
Yes.

563
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,960
Everything should be ready

564
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,400
before the sun rises tomorrow morning.

565
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,320
All right.

566
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,640
You will see. It will be done on time.

567
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,600
Lord.

568
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,080
Please make him realize.

569
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,400
He is indeed mighty.

570
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,120
Hey, young man!

571
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,680
If you want to defeat me,

572
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,080
you don't have to destroy
the whole region.

573
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,240
What are you waiting for?
Show me your power.

574
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,160
Pardon me, Gusti Prabu.

575
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,360
Let me face him first.

576
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,160
Hey, Sangkuriang,
you need to step over my dead body

577
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,080
before you get to face Gusti Prabu.

578
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,800
How insolent! Curse you, monkey.

579
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,040
It turns out you're not that good.

580
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,200
Pardon me, Gusti Prabu.

581
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,360
Your transformation powers
won't affect me at all.

582
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,080
Jaka, stop fighting.

583
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,720
Stop it, Jaka!

584
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,720
Father!

585
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,240
Please forgive me, Father.

586
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,880
And also your grandson, Jaka Sona.

587
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,120
- My grandson?
- Indeed.

588
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,840
Sumbi...

589
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,960
I'm proud of his strength.

590
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,600
Wait.

591
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,960
You need to know this, Jaka.

592
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,080
Prabu Sungging Perbangkara
is your grandfather.

593
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,880
No!

594
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,160
He's not my grandfather.

595
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,800
He's a vile king,
the oppressor of the people.

596
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,840
Jaka Sona.

597
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,200
Don't call me that.

598
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,800
Call me Sangkuriang.

599
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,800
Where are you going?

600
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,760
I'm going to fulfill
your conditions for our wedding.

601
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,920
<i>My dear Lord.</i>

602
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,520
<i>This world feels cramped to me.</i>

603
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,840
<i>You put too much karma on me.</i>

604
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:39,040
<i>I have hidden myself from disgrace</i>

605
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,680
<i>because I am ashamed to look at my fate.</i>

606
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,000
<i>But the trial is here again.</i>

607
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,200
<i>It comes and crushes me.</i>

608
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,080
<i>My Lord Romohun.</i>

609
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,040
<i>You gave me a lover,</i>

610
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,600
<i>but it turns out that he is my son.</i>

611
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,200
<i>My own flesh and blood.</i>

612
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,720
<i>But he wants to marry me.</i>

613
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,120
<i>What kind of karma
do you want to put on me?</i>

614
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,560
<i>Please help me!</i>

615
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,160
<i>Show me your greatness.</i>

616
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,320
<i>Show me a miracle.</i>

617
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,640
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

618
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,600
<i>Forgive us, Lord Hyang Rumuhun.</i>

619
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,240
Stop trying, Jaka.

620
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,160
You failed to fulfill your promise.

621
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,200
What do you mean?

622
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,560
Do you see that?

623
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,680
Sanghyang Rumuhun doesn't
give his blessing for our marriage

624
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,160
because you're my son.

625
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,040
Miss Larasati!

626
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,920
Wait, Larasati.

627
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,680
Wait!

628
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,760
Even though I failed
to fulfill your conditions,

629
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,880
you have to be my wife.

630
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,880
No!

631
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,800
You have been possessed by lust,
so you're not yourself, my son.

632
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,440
Whatever!

633
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,080
You've lost your mind.

634
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,640
You won't escape anymore.

635
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,760
Stop your madness.

636
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,920
You are indeed powerful.

637
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,520
You are so mighty.

638
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,720
You possess
the force of nature inside of you.

639
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,560
But your soul is empty.

640
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,760
Listen to me.

641
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,560
Because of your blind desire,

642
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,080
you've forgotten the justice and virtues

643
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,040
that you've been
fighting for all this time.

644
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,880
Moreover for a woman, your mother.

645
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,360
If you force me one more time,

646
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,640
then your mother will fade away forever.

647
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,800
Miss.

648
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,400
I still love you.

649
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,840
<i>Jaka Sona, aka Sangkuriang.</i>

650
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,720
<i>Your aspiration to love me
has been fulfilled.</i>

651
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,040
<i>But not as your wife.</i>

652
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,800
<i>I'm your mother.</i>

653
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,720
<i>Snap out of it.</i>

654
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,560
<i>Keep on aspiring</i>

655
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,520
<i>to free this nation
from its wicked rulers.</i>

656
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,560
<i>Farewell, my son.</i>

657
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,080
Mother.

658
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,400
Mother.

659
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,160
Forgive me, Mother.

660
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,400
<i>Dayang Sumbi is my mother.</i>

661
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,640
<i>Forgive my mistakes</i>

662
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,320
<i>and have mercy on me for my faults.</i>

663
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,360
<i>I truly regret it.</i>

664
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,320
<i>Because I can't get a hold of myself.</i>

665
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,280
<i>I truly regret it.</i>

666
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,880
<i>Because I forgot where I came from.</i>

667
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,000
<i>Please forgive Jaka, Mother.</i>

668
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,880
<i>Please forgive Sangkuriang.</i>

669
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,480
<i>It is said
the boat of the mighty Sangkuriang</i>

670
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,800
<i>has now been transformed
into an eternal monument.</i>

671
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,080
<i>The Tangkuban Perahu mountain.</i>

672
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,680
<i>Sangkuriang is the people's warrior.</i>

673
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,760
<i>Sangkuriang is a hero.</i>

674
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,280
<i>His aspiration to free this nation
from its wicked rulers</i>

675
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,680
<i>has been fulfilled.</i>

676
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,880
<i>The huge dam created by the hero</i>

677
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,040
<i>has slowly changed over the years.</i>

678
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:31,160
<i>It has turned into
the most beautiful city in Indonesia.</i>

679
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,200
<i>Bandung City.</i>

680
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,000
<i>The city of flowers.</i>

681
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,880
<i>The city of struggle.</i>

682
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,160
<i>The city of the Sea of Fire.</i>

683
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:46,240
<i>And the first city in the world
to hold the Asian-African Conference.</i>

684
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,440
<i>One is missing, two are counted.</i>

685
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:01,920
THE END
