1
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,462
Miss, may I help you?

2
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,702
I want some CDs of Jazz oldies

3
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,502
But I don't know which ones are better

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,803
Let me pick some for you

5
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,774
Thank you

6
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,829
Miss, these are Jazz
of sixties and seventies

7
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,360
All classics. You must love them

8
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,905
I like this one
Can you find one for me?

9
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,432
Yes. I'll keep these for you

10
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,599
Thank you

11
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,923
Ma'am, welcome home Yes

12
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,986
What would you like in dinner tonight?

13
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,192
No, thanks. Mr. Tang and I
will dine out tonight

14
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,918
Hello Hello. Mrs. Tang

15
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,023
You're losing weight

16
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,795
Bye Bye

17
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,464
Mr. Tang, Mrs. Tang's arrived

18
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,973
Hello Hello

19
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,195
Hello, Herman

20
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,461
Hello, Mrs. Tang

21
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,659
Come in

22
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,256
Hubby, it's time to go

23
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,358
Can we go now?

24
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,364
I'm ready. I'm only waiting for you

25
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,072
What do you feel about me tonight?

26
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,041
Gorgeous

27
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Thank you

28
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,243
Fiona will go tonight

29
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,306
Give her a lift?

30
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,748
Hello!

31
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,853
Fiona!

32
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,554
Could you go now?
My honey asked me to take you

33
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,389
I don't wanna bother you two

34
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,553
I'll go by myself

35
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,294
Don't take me like that

36
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,888
Clear it up. We'll wait downstairs

37
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,959
OK, I'll come down when done

38
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,584
Mandy... Excuse me

39
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,018
Mandy, my classmate sells red wine

40
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,389
He brought me
many bottles of good wines today

41
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,915
Wanna taste the wine with me?

42
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,597
We first met ten years ago?

43
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,330
More than that. It'll be 12 years soon

44
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,031
We met at the research centre that time

45
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,296
Research centre...

46
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,143
Do you know I've envied you
for 12 years?

47
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,776
Nuts. What do you envy me?

48
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:31,443
Bro. You're taller, stronger
and more handsome

49
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,475
You make more friends
and have better results in school

50
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,543
Remember Dr. Lo?

51
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,584
I do
Something's been long nagging me

52
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,611
What's that?

53
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,251
You're his pet. But he disliked me most

54
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,661
I don't know I'm that great

55
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,022
I'd like to ask you...

56
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,798
What do you think about me?

57
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,035
You...

58
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,232
always keep your old friends in mind

59
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,231
Frankly, we're busy with our business
after the graduation

60
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,268
If you don't hold the annual party

61
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,008
we wouldn't meet for a decade

62
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,809
I'm a good organizer

63
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,647
I can't agree more

64
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,215
And more to come tonight

65
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,413
What's that?

66
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,291
Ladies and gentlemen

67
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,288
My classmates. Come over, please

68
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,124
Well

69
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,731
Thank you for coming
to the alumni party every year

70
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,029
I hold the party
at different times each year...

71
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,933
to give you different surprises

72
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,105
We celebrated the birthday
for Fiona last year

73
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,107
This year she will

74
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,938
tell us what's in the party

75
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,875
Fiona, please

76
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,406
Today is the seventh wedding anniversary

77
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,041
of my buddies
Kenny Tang and Mandy Kwan

78
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,884
We wish them a happy marriage forever

79
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,281
Jason, please

80
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:52,859
Surprised?

81
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,963
I love you so much

82
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,091
Me too

83
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,700
So sweet

84
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,073
Go there to cut the cake

85
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,602
Kenny. You and Fiona...

86
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,166
What're you doing
at the research centre?

87
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,972
We're doing the testing
and observation of animal behaviour

88
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,777
We've got an assumption

89
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,816
Animals living together
including human...

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,254
have their respective communities

91
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,257
The individuals in the community

92
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,588
have their own identities

93
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,625
Such identities do not belong
to any individuals

94
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,757
They are enshrined by the other members
of the community

95
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,093
We are doing research
on animals in community

96
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,697
the relationship between each individual
and its identity

97
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,808
Do you know what he means?

98
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,740
I won't bother his work

99
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,746
Tired? Let's go home

100
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,579
No

101
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,553
You haven't met for long

102
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,056
Go on

103
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,048
Let me take a rest here

104
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,360
Kenny, what's the use of the research?

105
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,362
The fact is... if you can master
the responses of individuals

106
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,995
and the relationship
between subjects or objects

107
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,029
it'll help you to govern the society

108
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,367
What're you working on?
Research or politics?

109
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,173
Ask Dr. Lo, please

110
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,942
Dr. Lo - the snob who's long
been looking down on me?

111
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,840
He's the chief director
of our research centre

112
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,150
I made an appointment with him tonight

113
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,253
When did you make it?
I've never heard of that

114
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,048
Two days ago

115
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,081
When did he come?

116
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,418
It's hard to tell

117
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,329
You know his whereabouts is unknown

118
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,658
He'll come whenever he likes

119
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,827
It's hard to tell exactly

120
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,338
Isn't Dr. Lo your boss?

121
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,771
I've never seen him

122
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,230
Never

123
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,470
Dr. Lo

124
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,838
Dr. Lo, long time no see

125
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,103
Here comes Dr. Lo

126
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:21,909
Please be seated

127
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,742
Who?

128
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,456
Mandy

129
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,597
Get up, the others are gone

130
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,633
Why did you drink so much?

131
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,069
I've slept for a long time?

132
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,003
Yes

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,332
I'll go now. Everybody, bye

134
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,470
Kenny, thanks tonight

135
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,571
Mandy's drunk. Is she OK?

136
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,103
She's OK
She drank a little bit too much

137
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,241
Enjoy tonight

138
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,477
OK, keep in touch. Bye Good night

139
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,011
Has Dr. Lo been here?

140
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,780
Who's Dr. Lo?

141
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,556
Your boss

142
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,625
He's in the US

143
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,952
You're tired. Let's go home

144
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,097
Take care
I've told you not to drink so much

145
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,171
Take a nap
I'll wake you up when we're back

146
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,437
No, thank you

147
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm up

148
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,782
Yes, I was not sober

149
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,049
I seemed to hear you calling Dr. Lo

150
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,750
We did talk about Dr. Lo
But he wasn't here

151
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,419
So you were dreaming?

152
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,326
I really don't know

153
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:18,927
I drank too much

154
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,323
Forget it

155
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,861
Sally

156
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,738
Sally, it's you?

157
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,524
Sally

158
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,747
Sally, where're you?

159
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,554
Where's Sally?

160
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,099
New arrival?

161
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,101
Yes

162
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,831
This new stuff is fit
for matching clothes. Get your pick

163
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,101
This one is good

164
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,034
OK, I want it

165
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,567
OK, let me pack it

166
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,310
Help this miss, please

167
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:22,973
OK

168
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,981
Miss, what else do you want?

169
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,712
Nothing else

170
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,980
$1780. Thank you

171
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,755
Thanks

172
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,254
Miss. Please sign it

173
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,734
Thank you

174
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:47,970
Sorry, miss

175
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,067
Your signature is different
from that on the card

176
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,370
Could it be?

177
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,181
Sorry, I picked the card from my friend

178
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,085
I'll pay cash. Sorry

179
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,419
Let me tear it

180
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,184
OK

181
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,614
Thanks Sorry

182
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,959
May I speak to Fiona?

183
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,492
Sorry, she's not in

184
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,595
Is Mr. Tang in?

185
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,662
Mr. Tang's in the meeting

186
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,502
In the meeting?

187
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,466
Then... Forget it

188
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,069
Bye

189
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,616
Please wait...

190
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,645
Sir, someone's coming

191
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,526
Sorry. I'm late

192
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,567
Sorry. I was held up in traffic

193
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,606
Ms Ho, how's the cough of Uncle Lee?

194
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,771
It's better

195
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,367
That's fine

196
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,649
Good morning, Nanny Lau

197
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,421
Good morning

198
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:18,557
Good morning

199
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,888
Good morning, Uncle Lee

200
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:20,522
Good morning

201
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,701
Ms Ho said your cough is better now

202
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,834
Yes. Thank you. Miss

203
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,600
You called me Miss again?

204
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,841
We're close friends. Call me Mandy

205
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,771
Someone's called Mandy here

206
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,677
But she's off today

207
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,612
Really?

208
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,118
Let me get your lunch

209
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,053
You're so great

210
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,620
Give me one for Uncle Lee

211
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,830
Miss...

212
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,259
Sorry. There're rules
for this home for the elderly

213
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,099
Except the staff, relatives
and recognized volunteers

214
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,002
all the people
aren't allowed to feed the elders

215
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,366
Ms Ho, I'm a volunteer here

216
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,475
I'm Mandy. Remember?

217
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,645
Miss, which elder do you want to see?

218
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,607
I don't mean to see anybody

219
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,946
Why are you so... weird today?

220
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,443
You come here
not to see any people? Sorry

221
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,717
Here's private area. Please stay away

222
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,522
What're you talking about?

223
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,088
You see...

224
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:22,651
Miss!

225
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,054
Uncle Chan, remember me?

226
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,595
I'm Mandy

227
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,693
Miss...

228
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,358
You remember me, right?

229
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,533
I'm a volunteer Miss...

230
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,298
Don't bother the elders. Please

231
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,203
Auntie Ko, your son's going
to get married, right?

232
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,298
Miss, please leave!

233
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,532
What's the matter?

234
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,809
Director Ko

235
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,444
Director. Hi there

236
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,544
I don't know why... Ms. Ho's weird today

237
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,315
She can't make me out and kick me out

238
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,418
What's up?

239
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,582
Director. I don't know

240
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,321
This miss seems to know
many of the elders here

241
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,125
I thought she was here to see someone
But she said no

242
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,721
Sorry, miss

243
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,893
Only the relatives of the elders here
can come in

244
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,463
The others aren't permitted to do so

245
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,499
You've forgotten me?

246
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,871
I came here with my hubby last time...

247
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,376
You hired me as a volunteer

248
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,576
I'm Mandy, the wife of Kenny Tang

249
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,810
We've got a volunteer called Mandy here

250
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,880
But she's off today. Don't fool us

251
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,718
If you go on like this
the security guards will send you away

252
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,922
You'll lose your identity

253
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,168
your lover and even all you own

254
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,036
Sorry, I thought I'm in a wrong place

255
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,771
OK... Go on

256
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,950
Hello Is Mr. Tang in?

257
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,014
Mr. Tang is at the office

258
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,585
Mr. Tang, Fiona visits you

259
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,230
What did you call me?

260
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:09,825
Forget it...

261
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,876
Where did you go this morning?

262
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,746
Where did I...

263
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,438
You've forgotten
where I went this morning?

264
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,741
I ask you where you went this morning?

265
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,551
I was going to buy you a tie

266
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,451
What's up?

267
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,215
I don't care
what you've done this morning

268
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,420
Please finish this priority report
right now

269
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,860
Dr. Lo pushed me for two days

270
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,658
Report?

271
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,664
What're you saying?

272
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,800
What's wrong with you all?

273
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,200
I've just gone
to the home for the elderly

274
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,296
I don't know why no one'd make me out

275
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,934
I came here. Sandy took me as Fiona

276
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,377
By the way, where's Fiona?

277
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,679
Strange enough
her credit card struck me. See

278
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,448
Fiona, are you OK?

279
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,478
What did you say?

280
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,384
Fiona, you look weird today

281
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,347
Yes...

282
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,685
I seemed to be... possessed

283
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,061
Your hubby's got another woman

284
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,064
You're hooked on Fiona?

285
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,333
What's with you?

286
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,144
You're up?

287
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,806
I'll pick you up later

288
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,680
Who's she?

289
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,784
Nuts!

290
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,710
My wife - Mandy!

291
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,653
Your wife - Mandy?

292
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,250
Then who am I?

293
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,859
Fiona, if you're ill, go to see...

294
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,157
You're nuts! Stop!

295
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,430
Anybody else can forget me
but not you...

296
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,166
You go too far!

297
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,831
Go to see a doctor if you're ill
You're nuts

298
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,003
Stop!

299
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,980
Impossible

300
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,218
No way...

301
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,018
Robbery!

302
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,148
Sally!

303
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,911
Sally, do you remember me?

304
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,923
I do. You're Fiona

305
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,921
Why're you so late?

306
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,222
No. I'm Mandy

307
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,254
Mrs. Tang has lent you the car

308
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,796
She's got a poor memory
She's mad for a good day

309
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,027
saying she lost her car

310
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,034
You want Mr. Or Mrs. Tang?

311
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,529
Mrs. Tang's in?

312
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,071
Yes

313
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,135
Where's she?

314
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,349
Sally, who's it?

315
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,091
So late?

316
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,220
What're you up to?

317
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,097
Fiona, what's going on?

318
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,026
You're like that since today afternoon

319
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,900
Why do you call me Fiona?

320
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,803
She's Fiona, not anyone else

321
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,030
What's wrong with her?

322
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,799
Mandy, it's OK

323
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,435
Fiona may be not feeling well. It's OK

324
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,409
Fiona, what's with you?

325
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,483
I... I'm your wife
What're you two up to?

326
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:04,012
I'm Mandy. She's Fiona! OK...

327
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,589
Cool down. Listen

328
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,556
Tonight... stay and take a rest here

329
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,754
I'll take you
to see the doctor tomorrow. OK?

330
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,696
What doctor? I'm alright!

331
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,091
No one said you're ill

332
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,964
It's you-all. You're nuts

333
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,591
What? No kidding!

334
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,367
Fiona, leave us alone. OK?

335
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,708
I believe someone'd make me out

336
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,640
I'll call my former classmates
They'd make me out Fiona...

337
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,683
Sally, go back to your room

338
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,548
My former classmates'd know who I am

339
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,953
I've got some friends else...
Fiona...

340
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,221
They're all here

341
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,324
See

342
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,826
What're you looking for?

343
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,625
Here. All are here

344
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,531
Hands off my things

345
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,403
I think...
tomorrow you'd better go to...

346
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,671
Leave me alone!

347
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,776
Fiona...

348
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,872
Don't touch me! Leave me be!

349
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:06,876
Fiona!

350
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:10,955
Fiona...

351
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,253
Forget it. Go back

352
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,409
I'm so sorry

353
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,307
Ma'am

354
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,266
Good morning

355
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,801
Do you know me? Yes

356
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,871
The mangoes are nice. Do you want some?

357
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,413
I'm so happy. You can make me out

358
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,816
I know you Someone knows me

359
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,479
Mrs. Tang, good morning

360
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,616
Sally's not with you?

361
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,984
No, I went to the restaurant
with my hubby

362
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,219
I wanna buy some fruits here

363
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,386
You said you know me?

364
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,122
You called her Mrs. Tang, who am I then?

365
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,927
Fiona, don't go too far!

366
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,492
Go to see the doctor, OK?

367
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,696
Miss, the bananas are fine today

368
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,932
Buy some. They taste good

369
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,297
OK. Let me see

370
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,211
The apples are fine today

371
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,879
Buy some, miss

372
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,686
My hubby's Mr. Tang

373
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,620
Mrs. Tang, how are you?

374
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,581
She's Sally

375
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,555
You two always buy from me. I know you

376
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,989
You used to drop by at 11 a.m.

377
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,032
And you at 4 p.m.

378
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,729
Fiona, listen to me

379
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,127
You gotta see the doctor

380
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,799
I won't see a doctor!
Don't call me Fiona!

381
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,041
Tell me something about your childhood

382
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,542
Dr. Cheung...

383
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,114
Fiona, you're not at work today?

384
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,383
Hello... Anybody there?

385
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:11,752
Hello!

386
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,252
Anybody there?

387
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,959
Miss. Want someone?

388
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,796
Yes

389
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,894
There was an orphanage
set up by foreign church?

390
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,668
Yes. But it closed down
2 years ago in financial difficulties

391
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,784
Mandy...

392
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,686
Who's calling me?

393
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,958
Who's calling Mandy?

394
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:30,864
You...

395
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,998
Shout louder!

396
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,238
I'm Mandy...

397
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:48,681
Mandy!

398
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,648
Mandy! It's you?

399
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,553
So you're calling Mandy?

400
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,783
Mandy, it's you?

401
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,424
You're calling me?

402
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,324
Are you Mandy?

403
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,260
Yes! Yes! I'm Mandy!

404
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,127
I can make you out now I'm Mandy...

405
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,392
I've made you out. Mandy

406
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,490
You've made me out!

407
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,295
You're Mandy?

408
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,931
Yes, I'm Mandy! I can see you now

409
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,102
Take your time

410
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,384
Do you miss my bro?

411
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,583
I could never believe
my bro would jump to death

412
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,517
Cause he's so optimistic

413
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,486
For some time...

414
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,398
I thought that
his death is linked to you

415
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,761
What does that mean?

416
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,272
One thing, bro told me not to tell you

417
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,668
One time, two guys beat bro up

418
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,203
The one who beat him up
told him to leave you

419
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,486
Do you know who didn't want you
to be with my bro?

420
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,263
You're married?

421
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,200
Have I seen your hubby?

422
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,337
No... never

423
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,640
What, Mandy?

424
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,185
Did I say something wrong?

425
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,283
Sorry

426
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:35,751
Tell me... what's going on?

427
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:41,062
The strange things began
on the night of my husband's party

428
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:48,836
Mandy

429
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,977
Wake up. The others are gone

430
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,450
Take care
I've told you not to drink so much

431
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,547
Take a nap
I'll wake you up when we're back

432
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,255
No, thank you

433
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,292
I'm up

434
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,293
Yes, I was not sober

435
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,597
I seemed to hear you calling Dr. Lo

436
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,260
We did talk about Dr. Lo
But he wasn't here

437
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,000
So you were dreaming?

438
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,906
I really don't know

439
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,769
I drank too much

440
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,709
Forget it

441
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:47,929
Are you OK?

442
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,360
OK. And you?

443
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,399
I'm OK

444
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,678
Hubby, close your eyes, please

445
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,307
Can I read with my eyes closed?

446
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,115
Though it's passed 12 o'clock

447
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,977
this gift is still for you

448
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,653
Guess what it is?

449
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,514
Let me see

450
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,094
It seems to be a phone. Right?

451
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,660
How do you know that?

452
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,099
How do you know I like this model?

453
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,702
It has a handwriting board

454
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,469
Thank you, honey

455
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,902
Where's my gift?

456
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,470
Yours...

457
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,776
Really?

458
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,584
Yes. But the car company said

459
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,921
it's out of stock
We have to wait two months

460
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,926
Anyway, I've ordered it for you

461
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,086
What's the colour of it?

462
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,494
Your favourite... A red one!

463
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,693
My god

464
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,131
What's more...

465
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,433
What's more?

466
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,233
I've got a gift for you

467
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,242
Gift again?

468
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,364
Hello? Hello...

469
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:59,095
Hello? Hello...

470
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,997
Speak. You've woken me up. Speak

471
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,568
Nuts!

472
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,131
Miss Mandy Kwan, how do you do?

473
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,162
Maybe you'd feel weird

474
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,564
Who is this I after all?

475
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,669
That's not important

476
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,900
Cause I'm going to say something
very important to you

477
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,339
Maybe you think
you've got all the blessings now

478
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,576
But let me tell you...

479
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,220
There's an end to the fate of everyone

480
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,414
Your happiness starts from

481
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,155
your recalling
of the unhappiness in childhood

482
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,326
itll end

483
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,960
at your very happiness

484
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,228
Your husband has another woman

485
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:53,069
You will lose everything
including your identity

486
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,534
Mandy

487
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,738
Mandy

488
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,676
Come up. Or you'll catch cold

489
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,642
Don't cry

490
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,484
Tell me. What makes you so sad?

491
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,996
Do you have...

492
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,903
another woman outside?

493
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,608
Of course not

494
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,080
Why do you ask such a question?

495
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,349
Did you hear any rumour?

496
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:57,051
Sorry, it's my fault

497
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,229
Why do you say sorry to me?

498
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,765
I'm busy and leave you alone at home

499
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,306
So your mind is messed up

500
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,207
I do wanna stay more time with you

501
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,180
But my research is in its last stage

502
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:29,148
Dr. Lo keeps an eye out for it
I don't wanna lose here

503
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:36,088
By the way, Director Ko has replied me

504
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,199
Who's Director Ko?

505
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,968
My buddy

506
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,467
He's the director
of a home for the elderly

507
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,641
You always grumble
at the loneliness at home

508
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,045
and want a job

509
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,079
He agreed to let you
to be a volunteer in his institution

510
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,120
You'll help the elders

511
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,088
What's the matter? You don't wanna go?

512
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,561
Forget it if you don't want to

513
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,391
No

514
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,697
It's OK

515
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,667
It's OK now

516
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,837
Don't be nervous. Mr. Ko is a good man

517
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,509
Come in

518
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,372
Director Ko, how are you?

519
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,813
Hello

520
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,942
You must be Mandy

521
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,044
Yes

522
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,053
You're so lucky to have a good hubby

523
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,522
I've got a very good wife, too

524
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,081
Don't make fun of my wife

525
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,650
The dinner is on you On you

526
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,719
No kidding. Please sit

527
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,831
I'm Mr. Ko, the director
of the home for the elderly

528
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,601
How are you?

529
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,033
Please take care of Mandy for me

530
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:21,730
Sure

531
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:26,003
Mandy, let me tell you the procedures

532
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:26,737
Thank you

533
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,472
Excuse me. I have to receive a call

534
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,377
Go on, please

535
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,644
That's OK

536
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,180
Be right back

537
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,144
Mandy, when would you like
to start working?

538
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,650
Any time

539
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,319
What the hell?

540
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,191
Didn't I tell you not to call me today?

541
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,991
Say. It's nothing. Bye

542
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,260
Who's it?

543
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,326
Fiona. She wanna see me

544
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,601
All set?

545
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,362
Yes. All set

546
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,105
Let's go OK

547
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,403
Dine with me next week

548
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,239
Bye Bye

549
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,290
Like it? I've asked the car company

550
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,454
It's out of stock
We have to wait two months

551
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,259
Anyway, I've ordered it for you

552
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,330
Hi, Mandy

553
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,660
Hi What's up?

554
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,601
Excuse me. Talk over there

555
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,737
Wait a moment

556
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,286
Mandy, the research centre
sent me an urgent message

557
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,481
Drive my car back home

558
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,413
I'll take the car of Fiona

559
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,589
See you tonight. Bye

560
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,744
Follow the red car. Quick!

561
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,950
Miss, sorry. Maintenance. No Entry

562
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,755
The lift's over there
Get there to take it

563
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,335
Sorry, miss

564
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,735
Miss, sorry... Did I hurt you?

565
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,235
Sorry. Please take the goods out
I wanna get in

566
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,041
OK...

567
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,510
Miss. Let me take you to the doctor

568
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,810
I'm OK...

569
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,450
No, miss, do you want a security guard?

570
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,539
Hey! Anybody here?

571
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,777
Open the door!

572
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,940
Hello!

573
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,913
Sally

574
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,316
Sally, it was a blackout

575
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,897
Kenny? You...

576
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,492
Hello?

577
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,469
Hello?

578
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,806
Miss Mandy Kwan, how do you do?

579
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,738
Maybe you'd feel weird

580
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,010
Who is this I after all?

581
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,486
That's not important

582
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:18,057
Cause I'm going to say something
very important to you

583
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,722
Sally!

584
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,593
Sally...

585
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,540
Mandy...

586
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:38,937
Kenny

587
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,709
What's going on? I'm so worried

588
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,384
Sally, where were you
during the blackout?

589
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:48,556
There were no blackout

590
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,183
I watched TV at my room
No... there're one!

591
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,820
I shouted to you. Did you hear me?

592
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,557
I didn't hear you shout to me

593
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,231
Sally, go to your room. I'll take over

594
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,640
What's up? Nightmare again?

595
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,038
No! No...

596
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,241
It couldn't be a nightmare

597
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,651
Today afternoon...

598
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,553
What's wrong in the afternoon?

599
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,390
Nothing

600
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,192
Why didn't you ask your hubby...

601
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,664
what he did with Fiona
that day afternoon?

602
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,723
I couldn't ask that

603
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,430
I don't want Kenny know
that I tailed him

604
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,504
He'd be not happy

605
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,575
Mandy

606
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,574
Sally's in her room
Only you and I are here

607
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,810
Tell me. What's just happened?

608
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,513
I was waiting for you here

609
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,182
Suddenly, there was a blackout

610
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,917
I don't know why

611
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,893
there came a queer
calling but no one spoke

612
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,926
Then the TV set played the DVD by itself

613
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,161
Let me show you the DVD. See

614
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,100
A man in this DVD spoke to me...

615
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,162
I don't know what he was talking about!

616
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,132
Where's the DVD? It's gone?

617
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,200
It was over there!

618
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,875
Yes. I've put the DVD here

619
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,280
Trust me

620
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,145
What DVD? Is it important?

621
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,951
It's the man in the DVD who spoke to me!

622
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,853
I... Mandy

623
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,155
Mandy... You must trust me!

624
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,421
Mandy!

625
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,493
Calm down, please?

626
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,761
I'm scared...

627
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,362
I'm scared still

628
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,371
I don't know where it went

629
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,467
Don't be scared

630
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,521
Why don't you go to bed?

631
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,333
I'm scared still

632
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,495
Why? Tell me

633
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,468
I fear that you'd... have another woman

634
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,873
And...

635
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,648
I fear that I'd no longer
be myself suddenly

636
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:39,088
Everything's OK. Don't think that

637
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,991
Listen. Go to bed early

638
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,997
I'll take you to the doctor

639
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,696
What doctor?

640
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,469
My good friend Dr. Chow
He's a psychologist

641
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,571
You think I'm psychotic?

642
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,933
No. I don't mean that

643
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,034
You do!

644
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,311
Do you know I'm so worried today?

645
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,907
See Dr. Chow

646
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:05,853
Forget that he's a doctor
Take him as a friend

647
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,750
I'm worry about you. Be good. OK?

648
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,619
OK, I'll see Dr. Chow tomorrow

649
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,225
Don't go with me. Cause...

650
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,260
I don't wanna bother your work

651
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,997
Don't be like that
I'm worried if you go alone

652
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,735
You really think that I'm psychotic?

653
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,339
Of course not

654
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,178
Don't worry. I'm fine

655
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,445
Got it

656
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,382
Sleep, please

657
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,250
Come in

658
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,625
Mrs. Tang

659
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,155
Hello Hello

660
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,092
Call me Mandy Mandy

661
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,731
Kenny's called me. Please take a seat

662
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,213
Kenny, your wife's arrived

663
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,427
Don't worry. OK. Bye

664
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,694
I'm so sorry. Kenny told me...

665
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,598
to call him after you'd arrived

666
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,032
As his friend
I couldn't but promise him

667
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,596
And he did it out of the care for you

668
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,775
Make yourself comfortable in your seat

669
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,583
You look very tired. Need a rest?

670
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,994
I'm not tired. Thank you

671
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,423
Tell me your story

672
00:58:58,601 --> 00:58:59,863
What do you want?

673
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:01,831
Whatever

674
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,598
Tell the story of your childhood

675
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:14,582
When I was a kid...
I feared to talk with others

676
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,783
Everybody thought that I'm autistic

677
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,349
I grew in an orphanage

678
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,954
No one knew when my birthday was

679
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,660
The nun of the orphanage
gave me the name Mandy Kwan

680
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:41,107
Before that

681
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,506
no one knew who I was

682
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:54,347
Someone adopted children
from the orphanage

683
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,456
I recall that there was a kid

684
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,021
He had been called Mickey Cheung

685
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,062
Then, after the adoption

686
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,702
he came to see us

687
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,041
He said he was no longer Mickey Cheung

688
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:20,806
Cause his adopted dad had changed
his name to William Lam

689
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,717
He left me the phone number

690
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,359
He said when I felt bored

691
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:37,860
I might call him and chat with him

692
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:43,099
I remembered his phone number so well

693
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,901
I thought I could keep it
in mind for good

694
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,348
But soon

695
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,247
when I did wanna call him

696
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,692
I found that I'd forgotten it

697
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:09,997
When did you leave the orphanage?

698
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,594
18

699
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,600
When did you meet Kenny?

700
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,006
Around 19

701
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:25,837
He did treat me well

702
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,509
But I had a boyfriend at that time

703
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,627
You're not very happy these days?

704
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,194
Tell me. See if I can help you

705
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:54,867
I don't wanna say anything

706
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,873
It doesn't matter
Tell me what you wanna say

707
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:08,481
I think it's enough
I gotta go to the home for the elderly

708
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:10,855
Go to the home for the elderly?

709
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,657
Yes. I serve as a volunteer for it

710
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,362
OK. Talk to you later

711
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,136
Bye Bye

712
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,733
We've arrived. Get off carefully

713
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,266
Mandy

714
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,638
Granddads and grandmas, uncles and aunts

715
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,206
I bring you a new friend today

716
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,615
Hello, everybody. My name is Mandy Kwan

717
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:38,881
You may call me Mandy

718
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,015
From now on, we'll often meet
Isn't it good?

719
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,056
Good. Everything's on you now

720
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:44,855
Thank you

721
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,356
Listen to her

722
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,956
Being a volunteer
in the home for the elderly

723
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,301
I think that I'm very happy

724
01:02:55,371 --> 01:03:00,399
The sadness after watching
the DVD is gone

725
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,312
But I can never figure out
why when I woke up

726
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,646
everyone around me forgot me

727
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,678
Even my hubby took me as someone else

728
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:16,452
The strangest of all
I've become Fiona for no reason

729
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,791
And Fiona's become me

730
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:23,060
Only before you, I'm Mandy

731
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,799
So strange?

732
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,102
I don't lie

733
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:29,897
You don't believe me?

734
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,668
Tell me once more
What did the old man in DVD say?

735
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,179
He said Kenny is in love
with another woman

736
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,912
Your husband'd have another woman

737
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,552
And I'd lose everything

738
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,216
Including your identity and name

739
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,362
If what you said is real

740
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,798
I bet someone plays the tricks

741
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,699
And this guy...

742
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,306
has arranged everything around you

743
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,205
No, my hubby mustn't do that!

744
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,573
I don't mean your hubby

745
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,314
Why do you think that I mean your hubby?

746
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,286
If I can make you out

747
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,195
that means, someone else can

748
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,000
In fact, before I met you

749
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,731
I'd tried to find someone
to prove my identity as Mandy

750
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,566
But after the marriage with my hubby

751
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,478
I seldom contact my friends before

752
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:47,812
Cause my social contact is few

753
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,049
I don't even go to bank

754
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,585
I do everything on internet

755
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:59,159
All my friends are Kenny's

756
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,361
Maybe I think too far

757
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,198
I think that your strange encounters

758
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,970
may be linked to the death of my bro

759
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,599
What do you mean?

760
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,741
I've said nothing

761
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,222
Excuse me, miss
Smoking is not allowed here

762
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,560
Sorry. I'll smoke outside

763
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,329
Wait a moment. I smoke outside

764
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,171
Mandy

765
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:53,232
Mandy?

766
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,336
You're all devils!

767
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,404
Mandy, where are you going?

768
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,074
All want me dead! Mandy...

769
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,329
Don't move

770
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,737
Why am I here?

771
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,766
Miss. Calm down, please

772
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,643
You were in a coma for one day

773
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,871
Cause you've got
no identity evidence with you

774
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,347
we can't inform your family

775
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:35,982
Where's my friend Candy?

776
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,508
Where's my friend Candy now?

777
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,784
You meant the girl
sent here with you yesterday?

778
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:40,781
Yes

779
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,452
Sorry. We failed to save her

780
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,220
The cops'll do your testimony soon

781
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,028
I'd like to remind you
that we've checked your body

782
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,229
We found that you're pregnant

783
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,267
Please change her clothes
into a patient one

784
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:06,974
Let me take a rest

785
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:07,911
OK

786
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,251
Fiona

787
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,595
Why're you here?

788
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,993
Actually... I'm so sorry

789
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,372
Tell me. Where were you these days?

790
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,509
Would you have a drink with me?

791
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,303
No, I gotta go home

792
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,179
A moment only, I beg you

793
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,074
Just stay with me for a moment?

794
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,937
I just know you share
the same taste with Mandy

795
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:11,967
You both like lemon tea

796
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,064
Really?

797
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,770
You remember?

798
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,940
Tell me, where did you go these days?

799
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,389
I don't know
if I've lost the memory or not

800
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,523
These days went like dreams

801
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,833
Even I can't figure out the truth

802
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,000
I can't tell true from false

803
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,938
You know what I mean?

804
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,501
I know

805
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,676
Have you seen a doctor?

806
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,715
Even a doctor can't help me

807
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:58,450
I think you gotta go to see a doctor

808
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,490
I said a doctor can't help me

809
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,555
But you can't go on like that

810
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,689
I know

811
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,603
So, tell me what to do now

812
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,849
Tell me if you need my help

813
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:37,957
I'll help you if I can

814
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,524
You always treat me well

815
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,598
I can't hear you. Sorry

816
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,051
I said...

817
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:09,613
You really love Mandy?

818
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,734
I do love Mandy

819
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,363
Why do you ask that?

820
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,084
One day, if...

821
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,649
Mandy leaves you suddenly

822
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,856
you can never see her again

823
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,323
what would you do? Tell me

824
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,938
Fiona

825
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,768
We're always friends

826
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,411
I take I've never heard what you said

827
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,355
Sorry, I wanna go back home early

828
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:23,197
Talk with me tomorrow. Bye

829
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,460
Why do you do that?

830
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,002
Do you know Mandy's got your baby?

831
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,508
I love you

832
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,024
Hubby

833
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,709
Can you make it?

834
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,554
Can you make it, Mandy?

835
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,691
You're a fool! Fool! Fool!

836
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,054
Can you make it...

837
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,495
Mandy...

838
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,477
I won't blame you

839
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,272
Help me...

840
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,847
You're a fool. Mandy!

841
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:33,877
Can you make it...

842
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,750
We therefore come to a conclusion

843
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:42,425
What most people say it is true
it is true

844
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,428
whether it is by itself true or not

845
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,802
To shatter most people's illusions

846
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,102
is like swimming against the tide

847
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:57,077
Those who do not recognize
something everybody recognized

848
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,408
will end up a tragedy

849
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,284
I therefore declare

850
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,920
my project ends here

851
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,757
Because I'm planning another project

852
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:13,126
My objects are the offspring
of objects of this experiment

853
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:18,530
What's the difference between
the 1st and the 2nd generation?

854
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,297
You and I are waiting for the answer

855
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,731
Dr. Lo, I wanna quit

856
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,379
Kenny Tang
you're an outstanding researcher

857
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,672
You ought to know

858
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,948
the one at work is not the real you

859
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,855
Don't let emotion fail you

860
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,703
Remember how we met?

861
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,406
I do

862
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,045
We met at a lift failure

863
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,340
In the lift...

864
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,777
only you and I

865
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,588
At that time, you had a boyfriend

866
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:36,302
But after I first met you
for three months...

867
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,106
he died

868
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,849
We met...

869
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,724
all because of Dr. Lo

870
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,874
The death of your boyfriend

871
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,806
is also arranged by Dr. Lo

872
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,788
Starting from the orphanage

873
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,531
Dr. Lo has been observing you

874
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,727
He did a lot of testing

875
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,065
According to the findings

876
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,208
you're a sample of most ordinary people

877
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,903
So he picked you
as the object of the experiment

878
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:59,317
It costs us a lot of time
manpower and money...

879
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,123
to control and confine
your social contacts

880
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:11,095
The objective is to conduct
a research on the response

881
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,227
of an ordinary person
to facts and illusions

882
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,404
Sorry

883
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,017
I've made you suffer

884
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,170
Look at the birds

885
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,100
They're flying cheerfully

886
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,033
Fly with Mandy

887
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,778
She loves you so much

888
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,454
Kenny, fly with her!

889
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,528
I beg you

890
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,196
She really wants to fly

891
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,362
So you can see me now?

892
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,035
She said she loves you very much

893
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,144
You should be with her

894
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,776
You have to be tender towards her, OK?

895
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,349
You must love Mandy tenderly

896
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,457
Why don't you love Mandy?

897
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:50,363
Fly with her! Quick, fly with her...

898
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,833
She's waiting for you. Fly together

899
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,753
Gorgeous!

900
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:24,593
So high

901
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:31,463
Fear?

902
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,310
Fly if you don't fear

903
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:41,377
OK

904
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:17,983
Mandy

905
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,786
Get up, the others are gone

906
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,062
Let's go home

907
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,931
I've told you not to drink so much

908
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:36,894
We gotta go. Bye

909
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,396
Where's Fiona? Where's she?

910
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,743
Walter's sent her home
And we gotta go now

911
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,445
Kenny, thanks tonight

912
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:47,712
Mandy's drunk. Is she OK?

913
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,683
She's OK
She drank a little bit too much

914
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,475
Enjoy tonight

915
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,418
Keep in touch. Good night Bye

916
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:55,119
Has Dr. Lo been here?

917
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,150
Who's Dr. Lo?

918
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,453
Your boss

919
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,292
He's in the US

920
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:04,556
You're tired. Let's go home

921
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,662
Before I fell asleep

922
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,568
I did hear you calling Dr. Lo

923
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,964
He even held a stick

924
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,968
Could it be?

925
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,443
You must be dreaming

926
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:21,577
I was not dreaming. It's real for sure!

927
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,975
But I'm sure you were drunk
and were dreaming

928
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,079
There's no one called Dr. Lo

929
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:27,786
And no one holds a stick, OK?

930
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,468
Honey, nightmare again?
