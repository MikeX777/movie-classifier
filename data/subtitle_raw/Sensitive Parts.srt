1
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:33,778
Have I told you that
I like your shoulders?

2
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,233
Thanks, they attach my arms to my torso.

3
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:39,280
Yeah, they do.

4
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:58,708
What are you doing?

5
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,491
Nothing, I'm just...

6
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:05,178
Wiping the walls?
- No, I was trying to set the mood

7
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:07,655
by turning off the lights.

8
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,577
No, no, no, you can't
turn off the lights,

9
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:14,161
you gotta leave it on, I wanna see you.

10
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:16,092
Why?
- Because I need...

11
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,913
I need the full sensory experience.

12
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,328
No, that's so dumb.

13
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,675
No!

14
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,399
Don't you wanna see the rest of my tattoo?

15
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,880
The V-necks you wear
are all ready so low,

16
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:33,715
I'm pretty sure I've seen the whole thing.

17
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,877
I love when you sass me, Dolore.

18
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:43,205
Please don't say my name
when we're fooling around.

19
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,541
Why?
- Because it's the least sexiest

20
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,697
pronoun in the world.

21
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,741
I'm tired.

22
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,241
You should go.

23
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:11,123
I don't want you to fall asleep
at the wheel and die.

24
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,967
It's cold out there.

25
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,920
Put your clothes on first obvs.

26
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,105
Can I stay here?

27
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,707
That's a possibility.

28
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,769
It would be nice.

29
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,183
Don't you think?

30
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:44,136
I don't know.

31
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:50,237
I didn't really think about it.

32
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,286
Don't send me out there in the cold.

33
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,232
I feel so used and abused.

34
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:11,752
Okay.

35
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,135
Just...

36
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,198
don't look!

37
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,867
I thought you were tired.

38
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:37,581
I am, but I need to
do something to unwind

39
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,500
and it's either this or

40
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,296
binge watch episodes of
The Mindy Project,

41
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,187
and I thought this would be
quieter for you.

42
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,894
So thoughtful.

43
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,374
How long have you been up?

44
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,390
Just a few minutes.

45
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,827
I was looking forward
to waking up together.

46
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,554
Morning breath.

47
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:25,022
Morning breath is part of the experience.

48
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,883
So what are you doing today?
- Just work.

49
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,829
Then I'm gonna call Sinead and find out
what time her flight gets in.

50
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:42,382
Oh yeah, she gets in tomorrow, right?

51
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,047
I know, I can't wait.

52
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:47,040
I can't wait to see her,
it's gonna be so exciting.

53
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,813
I'm excited to meet her.

54
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:52,046
I tried to creep her
on Facebook actually but,

55
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,158
couldn't find her.

56
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,399
Yeah, she's not on Facebook.

57
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,313
Rebel.
- Yeah.

58
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,582
Do you want any like milk or sugar?

59
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,008
No no, tell me more about Sinead.

60
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:11,099
She's like Ernest Hemingway
with a vagina.

61
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,180
Nice, what else?

62
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,868
She's like confident, and amazing,
and talented,

63
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:18,954
and smart, resilient, and tough, and...

64
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:22,806
She's like a total babe.
- I can't wait to meet her.

65
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,947
Make sure you text me
about those dinner plans.

66
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:30,353
Yeah.
- 'cause you know I'll forget.

67
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:33,275
What about you, what are you doing today?

68
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,158
You're meeting the ex, aren't you?
- Yeah, eventually.

69
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,488
Where you guys going?

70
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:44,285
We're going to...
we're going to the Storm Crow.

71
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,511
I really like that place.

72
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:49,035
I'm really glad that
you introduced me to it.

73
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,043
Yeah, yeah, me too, I mean,

74
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:55,449
it's one of her favorite places too so,

75
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,450
since she's only in town
for a little while,

76
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:01,277
I guess she wants to maximize her time.

77
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,402
Yeah.

78
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,738
Did you guys go there a lot?

79
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:08,457
Yeah, a fair bit,
she knew one of the servers.

80
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:12,941
Are you guys going for a food,
like dinner, or...

81
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,136
No, no, I don't think so.

82
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:19,096
I guess it's just drinks or couple beers,

83
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:21,160
just something chill like that.

84
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:24,791
That'll be good,
that'll be like cool, just...

85
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:27,927
hanging out and having beers.

86
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:32,318
It will be fine, it's just...
just to like mend fences and...

87
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:35,880
maybe catch up a little bit or whatever,
but that's it.

88
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,794
It's good though because...

89
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,505
You know, I hate being on bad terms
with any of my exes.

90
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,325
It's the worst.

91
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,192
<i>You're all right.</i>

92
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,614
<i>You got nothing to worry about.</i>

93
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,356
<i>You're irreplaceable.</i>

94
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:48,488
Hey, hey, thank you
so much for last night, I...

95
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,365
for letting me stay and like...

96
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:52,646
everything, I had such a good time.

97
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,325
Yeah, it's fine, you
don't have to thank me.

98
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,505
I also thought it was pretty great.

99
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,661
I really like you, Dolore.

100
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:03,107
Yeah?

101
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,348
Yeah.

102
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:13,446
Cool.

103
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:43,111
Yeah, no, I know the form
you're talking about.

104
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,743
Yep, you'd, both sides, yeah,

105
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,759
and then sign it at the bottom.

106
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,211
No, no, I'm not saying our
fax machine doesn't work,

107
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,545
yep, we have a fax machine.

108
00:11:55,771 --> 00:12:00,349
Yes, I will call you and let
you know when we have it.

109
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,810
You're welcome, bye.

110
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,358
Honey.

111
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,300
That's not gonna make you feel better.

112
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:05,284
I am pathetic.
- Nothing about you is pathetic,

113
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,855
you just got some bad habits.

114
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:11,699
I just can't stop thinking about all these
horrible things that are happening.

115
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:12,816
Listen...

116
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:16,039
that scrawny white boy
wouldn't do anything

117
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:20,433
to jeopardize his chances
at getting another taste.

118
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,698
You feel me?

119
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,425
You say that, but he's had
a lot of girlfriends.

120
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,658
So?

121
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,128
He'll be able to appreciate you more
in comparison.

122
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:29,511
I'm not like you!

123
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,363
People don't regret it
when they leave me.

124
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:35,589
I also don't get to write a pop song
about it and rub it in their face.

125
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,722
I'm sure you've broken
more hearts than you know.

126
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:45,200
I didn't see... I didn't see it coming
the last time.

127
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:47,559
Yeah well...

128
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:50,098
I knew that one was trouble
the moment he walked in.

129
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,567
Yeah, but you can't always
know it though, right?

130
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,644
No, you can't.

131
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:57,888
But it doesn't matter.

132
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:01,442
No horrible thing could ever
bring you down!

133
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,122
You're tough.

134
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:05,255
Yeah?
- Yeah!

135
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,754
Call your girlfriend.

136
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,973
Hi.
- Hey, let me see your face.

137
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,091
Hey (........)!

138
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,380
What up, slut?

139
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,184
I get to see you tomorrow!

140
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,341
I know, I can't wait, I'm so excited.

141
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,997
Do you need me to pick you up in the airport?
- Yes, please.

142
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:29,473
And you are still packing.

143
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:32,388
I'm almost finished packing, actually.

144
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,644
Are you used to sleeping in airports yet?

145
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:37,622
No, that is not my
favorite part of traveling.

146
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,956
Well at least you have traveled,
I mean...

147
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:40,995
you're so worldly.

148
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,755
You know what, you will travel,
we will travel.

149
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,645
I know, I know.

150
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,864
I'm just... I guess I've just been
getting antsy 'cause

151
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,425
I've worked in an office for a year,

152
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,230
and you've been trotting
the globe like a horse

153
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,934
with a freaking fire card.

154
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,763
Well I have been giving
my fair share of rides.

155
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,638
Giddy up.

156
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:05,016
So... what's your...
last week been like?

157
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:07,641
It's been okay.

158
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,156
I've been a little nervous about leaving,

159
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:12,412
you know, just like uprooting myself,
but...

160
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,774
I'm just not letting it bother me.

161
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:16,977
Makes sense, I mean,
leaving everyone behind,

162
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,688
I'd be pretty crushed.

163
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:24,480
Go to bed sweetie,
what are you even doing up?

164
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:27,980
Hanging out, waiting to talk to
your babely self.

165
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,151
And?

166
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:34,781
I looked at some stuff on the internet
and made myself feel like crap.

167
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:36,172
Dolore...

168
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,586
are you okay?

169
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,904
It's just gonna be really good
to have you back, Sinead.

170
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:46,234
I have missed you so much, my love.

171
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,613
I'm so glad that we're gonna be living
in the same city again!

172
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:02,762
Hello!

173
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:13,989
Yo, girl!
- You're here!

174
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,818
I'm so excited, I was so scared
you were gonna

175
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,358
get on a different flight at Pearson, that

176
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:21,217
I called the passport
office and told them that

177
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,538
you were their first one-way,
jihadess!!!

178
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,093
That makes sense.

179
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:29,914
I was wondering why they took my vibrator.

180
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:33,991
Guess they didn't want me to
blow up a plane, fair enough.

181
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,890
Then I kind of got my
attention caught by something

182
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:40,468
right in the corner of my eye,
so I turned to see what it was

183
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:43,858
and the guy next to me had his dick out.

184
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,483
What?
- Yeah like, fully out on the bus,

185
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,108
fucking masturbating.

186
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,265
Honestly, I was like scared, like how
do you handle this kind of situation?

187
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,647
I've never...

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,163
been around this before.

189
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,021
Like obviously looking back on it,

190
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:59,819
I had nothing to worry about,
it wasn't like real danger,

191
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,701
but it's really...
freaky.

192
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:03,647
I mean, yeah.

193
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:07,538
That was probably like the weirdest,
maybe even worst moment.

194
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:10,265
Like that's the kind of stuff that would
like scar me for life.

195
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,577
That's the kind of stuff
that just makes me so nervous

196
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,265
about traveling, I don't wanna do it.

197
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,724
Honestly, if I let
every weirdo and asshole

198
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:20,419
scar me for life, my whole
body and soul would look

199
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,185
like Seal's face.

200
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,387
You just get over it.

201
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,017
Well, what do you wanna
do now that you're back?

202
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:38,572
Okay, I know this will probably
sound kind of crazy coming from me...

203
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,314
but I feel like I might be ready to,

204
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,901
like settle down and start my real life.

205
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,340
Like get pregnant?

206
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,736
No, no, not, no.

207
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:54,556
I mean like get a steady
job and like save some money

208
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:58,111
and maybe just do some volunteer work,
or read a book

209
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,579
just because.

210
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,689
Have like a real relationship,

211
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,767
and... be a better friend.

212
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,361
Okay, you're a great friend,

213
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,369
but if you run on me again,

214
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:12,291
I'm gonna hunt you down
and I'm gonna kill you.

215
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,056
I'm gonna have you embalmed.
- Do what?

216
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,409
So you can have me around forever.

217
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:19,523
No, so I can like touch your
stupid face whenever I want.

218
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,461
No, you cannot do that
to me while I'm driving,

219
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,319
I almost hit that guy.

220
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,033
Well speaking of relationships,

221
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:30,057
now that you're back, do you think you're
gonna try and ignite an old flame?

222
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,283
You know like...

223
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:35,454
see what that friendly ghost is up to?
- Casper?

224
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,970
I don't know. I mean I haven't
talked to him since I left,

225
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:44,204
so I don't even know what
he's up to these days.

226
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,486
You haven't talked to him at all, have you?
- No.

227
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:55,320
I mean, I think it would
be nice to see him again,

228
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:59,037
but I also think it
could be really awkward.

229
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:03,234
I mean, there's just so
many unresolved feelings.

230
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,164
Feelings?

231
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:08,633
Would you believe that I
still stalk him online a bit,

232
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:11,344
like a little bit, like...
once every two weeks.

233
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,195
Of like all the wieners.

234
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,922
I know, I know, of all the dicks,

235
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,649
he's the one that got away.

236
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:24,273
You know what, I cannot wait to get home,

237
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,523
have a shower, get this plane off of me,

238
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:30,929
and then we can start
talking about tonight.

239
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:34,906
We're gonna like tear it up,
we're gonna like party and stuff.

240
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:38,523
And am I gonna get to meet your new
piece of man meat tonight too?

241
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:39,656
Yes.

242
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:42,851
I am so excited.

243
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:53,642
Sexy moves.
- Thanks, I've picked up a few.

244
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,296
What about the food,
do you two want me watching it?

245
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,435
Tonight is the casserole,
you put in the oven

246
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,030
and it heats.

247
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:02,187
Okay.

248
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,541
Sounds like a dance party in here.

249
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:16,680
Well hello studly do me right.
- Hello.

250
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,837
Listen, I know how
much you love boxed wine

251
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,149
but let me introduce you to...

252
00:20:22,174 --> 00:20:23,259
Bottled wine.

253
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:25,048
Well hello.
- How fancy.

254
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,532
Right?
- Come on.

255
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,693
Sinead?

256
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:36,819
Right, this is my best friend
in the whole entire world... Sinead!

257
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,233
Hey, Riun.

258
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,801
Sinead.

259
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:45,881
She just got back from this crazy adventure
traveling to all these crazy places.

260
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:48,975
She's amazing, she's super smart,

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,725
and she's a total sexy man eater.

262
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:55,520
Obvs!!!
- Obvs... for sure.

263
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,606
Oh, he takes people
around Wisser on tours,

264
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,092
and he makes really good sandwiches,

265
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,092
and he has some pretty neat tattoos.

266
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,365
I do.

267
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,912
I'm gonna have to try
one of those sandwiches.

268
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,748
You like Reuben's?

269
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,178
Sure.

270
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:12,959
This is so exciting
that you guys are actually

271
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,631
in the same room together, oh my gosh!

272
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,584
I have to go pee, but
you guys keep chatting

273
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,280
and...
I'll be back.

274
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,799
I'll get some glasses.
- Yeah.

275
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,908
Hey, how's it going out there?

276
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,299
Great!!!

277
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,607
It's just really hard to
believe that people actually

278
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,869
like me so to have them
in the same room together

279
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:41,518
just really helps prove they're
not figments of my imagination.

280
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,381
So.

281
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:50,303
Where exactly were you traveling?

282
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:54,240
Europe, Amsterdam,
Barcelona, a few places.

283
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:58,412
Yeah... and you were studying at
Dalhousie before that, right?

284
00:21:58,437 --> 00:21:59,437
Yup.

285
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,679
Cool, I've always
wanted to visit Halifax.

286
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:06,743
You should it's...
it's got a really great music scene,

287
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:07,857
lots of history.

288
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:09,990
I will, I will.

289
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,086
So, and you and... you and Dolore...

290
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:17,498
you were, were you friends
before you went there or...?

291
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,312
Yeah, we go way back, junior high.

292
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:26,422
That's cool, that's really cool.
Your relationship's lasted so long,

293
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,570
it's like, I mean, she talks
about you all the time.

294
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:32,148
She has a lot to say about you too.

295
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,640
Good things?

296
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:38,328
I think she appreciates
your sense of humor.

297
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,380
She's really funny.

298
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,021
Yeah?

299
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:45,279
I don't know, she makes me laugh a lot.

300
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:48,969
I really like her.

301
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,487
What about you?

302
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,016
Traveling... what?

303
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,477
Traveling... no, I mean not really,
I mean I just

304
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,331
a couple road trips.

305
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:03,752
Not to far, I could never really
afford to go very far.

306
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:04,737
What about school?

307
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:07,971
Did you do, like a tourism program
or something before

308
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:09,065
getting this job?

309
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,588
Nope.

310
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:14,088
I went to UBC,
did some random stuff for a while...

311
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:16,768
and then dropped out, and then

312
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:19,088
actually got the job
through a friend of mine.

313
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:21,245
You went to UBC?

314
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,424
Yeah, I mean, yeah it
was like six years ago,

315
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:27,835
didn't last very long.

316
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:35,049
You didn't go to UBC, did you?

317
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,494
Yeah, I mean, I started there,

318
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,729
but I transferred to Dal, so.

319
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,369
Okay, yeah, that might be it.

320
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,299
What might be it?

321
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,309
Did you know Luke Sudderbee?

322
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,020
I did.

323
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:55,889
I went to a few of his parties
in my first year.

324
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,466
Yeah.

325
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,884
You do look really familiar.

326
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,809
We didn't...

327
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,848
We did, we totally had sex.

328
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:21,543
They seemed a little awkward.

329
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,793
I mean, it's just really hard when people

330
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:26,761
meet and you have to introduce them
and you've gotta start conversations,

331
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:27,810
and be the facilitator.

332
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,504
You're working yourself
up, just let it happen.

333
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,615
I just, I don't know,
I hate being the center

334
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,490
of attention, it's just way too stressful.

335
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,091
Better get used to being
the center of attention,

336
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:39,210
beautiful face like yours.

337
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:42,247
I mean, I just, I can't
handle these group settings.

338
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,474
I just think that...

339
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,990
Honey, there's two people out there.

340
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,599
Yeah well, that's a company, what is it?

341
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:51,068
Three is a crowd, three is a crowd.

342
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,247
Listen.

343
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,198
They got one major thing in common...

344
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,810
your sexy self.

345
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:03,195
You just gotta unite them around
their mutual love for you.

346
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,787
How many people did
you have to sleep with

347
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:07,530
in order to not even recognize me?
- Your hair's all fucking curly now,

348
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,810
You look totally different!
- You're not wearing my vagina beard

349
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,341
and I can still recognize you eventually.

350
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:13,490
Eventually, nice.

351
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,341
Okay, how drunk were you?
- I don't know, I don't remember.

352
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:19,800
I didn't have a fucking
breathalizer with me.

353
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:22,568
This is really bad, this fucking,
fucking bad,

354
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:24,427
this is so bad.
- All right.

355
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,724
You know maybe...

356
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:30,543
maybe it's not...
the most ideal circumstances,

357
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:33,325
you know, but...
it was six years ago,

358
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,654
and... and... and you...

359
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,458
I don't even know your last name.

360
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,129
And... I barely remember you.

361
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:42,233
I don't think it's a big deal,

362
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:45,279
I think... I think we should just
come clean right away.

363
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:47,105
We should just tell her and just fucking,

364
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,084
like just quick like a
bandage, just fucking rip it.

365
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,582
This isn't gonna be like
a fucking bandage for her, okay?

366
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:52,793
It's not gonna be a bandage!

367
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,316
It's gonna be like ripping off a scab
and rubbing dog shit in the wound.

368
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:57,419
It's...

369
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,975
I just don't feel comfortable lying to her,
you know what I'm saying?

370
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,050
I have known her for a very long time

371
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:04,935
and knowing this would crush her.

372
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:08,192
So if you actually care about
her like you say you do...

373
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:10,622
you will not tell her!

374
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,065
Okay, tell me right now.

375
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,034
Are you absolutely certain,

376
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:20,174
that she can't handle it?

377
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:25,877
Riun... don't say anything.

378
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:31,408
Time to dance bitches.

379
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,034
Come on!

380
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,092
Sinead, this one is for you.

381
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,486
Come on!

382
00:26:58,332 --> 00:27:00,355
Is there something wrong
with the casserole?

383
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,785
Nothing, I'm just
saving room for dessert.

384
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,684
Sinead, I made you a casserole,
you expected me to make you dessert as well?

385
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,111
We could go get gelato after, we could

386
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:11,418
we can go to that 200 flavor
places, is that still open?

387
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:13,129
Yeah, it's just...

388
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:15,941
You don't wanna go there,
they've got ice crystals in their gelato.

389
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:19,355
They also have crazy,
awesome, fun flavors.

390
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,221
I had blue cheese once.

391
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:25,332
Why, why would you do that to yourself?

392
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:26,660
Riun, what about you?

393
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:29,199
What's the weirdest
flavor you've ever had?

394
00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:33,035
I had wasabi once.

395
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:36,340
It was awfu...
I regretted it.

396
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:40,277
You guys are the king and
queen of poor choices.

397
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,190
I do wanna do something
after dinner though,

398
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:44,597
I wanna get reacquainted
with all my favorite spots.

399
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,558
Well, Riun, we should show
Sinead around this week.

400
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,285
Yeah, you should totally do that.

401
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,238
I... I want you to come with us,
I want you to know my better half.

402
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,113
Well yeah, but you...

403
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:57,419
there's a lot of catching up to do and like,
I don't wanna intrude on best friend time.

404
00:27:57,443 --> 00:28:00,066
Riun, it's fine, actually you know,
you and I could,

405
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,691
get to know one another.

406
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:07,166
Yeah, Dolore, I...

407
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:11,119
I'm getting old...

408
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,080
you know?

409
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:14,291
And so...

410
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:16,705
with that,

411
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:22,533
I... I... I just, I'm feeling like I
need to prioritize my time

412
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,666
a little bit, you know?

413
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,259
And my priority...

414
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:30,377
what I want the most... is

415
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:33,150
to get to know you better...

416
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,231
just you...

417
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:38,783
before anyone.

418
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,330
And...

419
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:45,064
you know, I just... I just wanna hang
out with just the two of us.

420
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,756
For a bit, you know?

421
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:51,886
You're a dork.

422
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:54,558
You get to know me so much better
by seeing me with Sinead.

423
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:56,214
Am I right?

424
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:58,578
A little off the chain.

425
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:04,534
Okay, yeah, I mean you're right,
you're right, you are.

426
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,191
I mean, part of getting to know you
is getting to know...

427
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:10,214
people that are important to you.

428
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:11,909
So...

429
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:16,761
all three of us will hang out.
- Great.

430
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,816
I just...

431
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,956
you know Sinead?

432
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:23,276
You and Riun have something in common.

433
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:26,464
You both think that I'm great.

434
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:28,783
And I think that you guys are great,

435
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:33,441
and I really hope that the two of you
think each other are great,

436
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,558
and I wanna stop saying great.
- You do kind of sound like Tony the Tiger, so.

437
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,128
What I'm trying to say is that...

438
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,542
it's just really nice to have

439
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,163
two of my most favorite people,

440
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:48,526
over in my apartment for dinner.

441
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,612
So... thank you.

442
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:52,144
You're so wonderful, Dolore.

443
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,620
Am I really one of your favorite people?

444
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:57,395
You're one of my favorite people too.

445
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,883
Oh, man, there's just so
much love at this table,

446
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,316
it's like this is how threesomes start.

447
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:07,830
No, I could never have a threesome with you
because you are too hot,

448
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:11,042
and I would look like
Danny Devito next to you.

449
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:13,628
Like a super sexy hot Danny Devito.

450
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:16,605
In what universe is there
a sexy Danny Devito?

451
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,276
You guys are both effing ridiculous,

452
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:21,832
you, oh my god, you guys would
have the cutest children.

453
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:22,926
Well I... I can't do this.

454
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,895
What, like what?
- Riun, don't.

455
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,160
What are you talking about?
Do you... do you have an STI?

456
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,835
No, I don't have an STI.

457
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:37,327
But I do have to tell
you something important.

458
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:42,099
We... have to tell you something important.

459
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:47,492
Even though it's important,

460
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,874
it's not a big deal, okay?

461
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:53,093
Okay.

462
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:58,343
We didn't...
we didn't recognize each other at first,

463
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:03,015
but Sinead and I have met before,

464
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:05,890
at a party,

465
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:08,361
like around six years ago.

466
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:13,578
We were really, really drunk,

467
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,883
and we had sex.

468
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:23,813
And it was...
it was a one time thing, Dolore,

469
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:27,436
and it was completely unmemorable,

470
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:32,374
and... and I didn't have feelings
for her and I don't now,

471
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,936
and I haven't seen or spoken to her since.

472
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:42,655
I'm not telling you this to hurt you,

473
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:45,507
not that it should hurt you,

474
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:50,351
I'm telling you this because I respect you

475
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,171
and... because I care about you.

476
00:31:57,202 --> 00:32:01,210
And... because you deserve the truth.

477
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:07,803
And I never, ever wanna lie to you.

478
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:27,080
I just need a few minutes
just to be by myself.

479
00:32:28,338 --> 00:32:29,885
Don't you want to talk about it?

480
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,510
No, I just need a few minutes,
I'll be right back.

481
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:36,307
Okay.

482
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,901
If that's what you want,
we'll be right here waiting.

483
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,339
It's all right...

484
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:20,745
you're special...

485
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,577
you're one in a million.

486
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,316
Honey.

487
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:41,697
Fuck, fuck!

488
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:44,174
Fuck, fuck!

489
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,198
I think that's what got us into trouble
in the first place.

490
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:47,487
She always thought she couldn't trust me.

491
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,604
She had her own reasons,

492
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,338
it had nothing to do with you
for her to be, no.

493
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:52,908
No.

494
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:54,752
No, it's not her fault.

495
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,339
Right, I get it,
you feel like an asshole,

496
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:58,393
I feel like an asshole too.

497
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:01,190
But it's because we care,
we didn't do anything wrong.

498
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,908
I have, I have done things wrong.

499
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,283
Not to her but...

500
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:11,400
you're probably not the only girl
I can't remember.

501
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:18,877
Sinead, I feel like an asshole
because I am an asshole.

502
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,959
Listen, I get it.

503
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:27,844
I've fucked around a lot too
and I've hurt people accidentally

504
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,883
and I'm not proud of it,

505
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:32,236
but I don't feel guilty about consequences

506
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:36,244
that I couldn't expect,
and neither should you.

507
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:40,213
Okay, you know her best,
tell me what to do.

508
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:42,724
What do we do, how do we fix it?
- I don't know.

509
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:44,963
Come on, what do we say to her?

510
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:47,463
What does she need to hear?
- We can't change how she feels.

511
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:49,880
But... bullshit, we just
gotta convince her that this...

512
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,621
How we gonna convince her?

513
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,747
She doesn't trust us
because we're the problem!

514
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:57,146
What kind of friend are you?

515
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:01,560
You're not even willing to try
to help her deal with this.

516
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:06,560
I'm not gonna sit here and be lectured
by a pair of balls and dick!

517
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,731
You know what, what do guys
even know about friendship?

518
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,284
What do you do, you help them move,
you get a fucking beer!

519
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,716
You have never wiped the
tears off your friends face.

520
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,523
You never sat with them for three hours

521
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:23,929
and they have panic attacks
and cried because

522
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,992
the douche bag who cheated on them

523
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:29,157
fucking posts a picture of him
with a new girlfriend.

524
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,157
So fuck you!

525
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:40,804
Dolore...

526
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,395
Dolore, I'm so sorry.

527
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,525
Dolore...

528
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,708
you know I love you.

529
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:52,667
And I am so sorry that this happened.

530
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:57,355
Please don't let it change anything.

531
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,652
It's okay.

532
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:02,730
I'm okay.

533
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:07,603
I know that it happened a long time ago

534
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,241
and... that it was like a one time thing,

535
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:16,874
and... I understand why you
didn't tell me right away.

536
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:18,022
But...

537
00:36:18,374 --> 00:36:21,432
I just need some time to process this,

538
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:23,913
so I just need you guys to leave.

539
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,420
I really want us to talk about this.

540
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:53,897
I don't want to right now.

541
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:20,366
You know those get backed up?
- I know.

542
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,444
Just deal with it later.

543
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:27,358
Can't have them following me around.

544
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,851
I know it hurts right now,

545
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
but you don't have to do this.

546
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:36,374
You can face this, you
can get through this.

547
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,069
No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

548
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,827
No, I can't!

549
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,553
Can't all be Fierce.

550
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:41,874
Hey.

551
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,608
Riun, I told you I needed time,

552
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:52,530
I really wish you hadn't come by.
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

553
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:54,933
I'm sorry.

554
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,637
I wanna give you your space,

555
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:01,053
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

556
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,316
And I really need to talk.

557
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:10,840
Are you sure you're okay
because you don't seem okay?

558
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,806
Are you really not gonna say anything?

559
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,174
Are you just planning on
ignoring me for long enough

560
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:25,166
that I give up and go away?

561
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:27,009
I don't know what you mean.

562
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:29,119
Look.

563
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,611
I know...

564
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,845
I know...
that this kind of thing

565
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,127
really bothers you.

566
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,121
I feel like I can guess as to why.

567
00:40:44,497 --> 00:40:45,841
All I can say...

568
00:40:46,326 --> 00:40:49,154
is that I'm sorry that you had
to deal with that because...

569
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,318
you really don't deserve it.

570
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:53,701
And...

571
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,271
I'm sorry that my shit
gets in the way too, and...

572
00:40:57,296 --> 00:41:01,250
that my personal shit makes
the situation even worse, you know?

573
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,409
I'm so sorry about that!

574
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:10,425
But we have something really good,

575
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,871
and I don't want you to throw it away.

576
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:16,019
I wanna fight for it!

577
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:20,925
I wanna do anything that
I can to hold on to it.

578
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,474
I'm sorry Riun, but...

579
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,060
I don't think that we
can hang out anymore.

580
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,818
No, listen to me!

581
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:36,497
Dolore please, just, just help me...

582
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:38,576
help me understand you. Just...

583
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,751
help me see why it's such a big deal

584
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:44,756
that we can't get past it, that we...
that we can't just work on it.

585
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:49,368
You know when we're...

586
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,048
lying in our bed,

587
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:56,314
or my bed, or whoever's bed,
and we're just kissing and cuddling,

588
00:41:56,939 --> 00:42:01,268
we're staring in each others eyes
and it's intimate and beautiful?

589
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:04,204
In those moments...

590
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:07,603
I am so scared of you.

591
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:11,454
I am so scared that you're
just gonna open your mouth

592
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:15,646
and say something that will
absolutely destroy me.

593
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:21,003
And when you text me,
and when you call me,

594
00:42:21,028 --> 00:42:24,966
I panic because I just imagine opening it

595
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:29,310
and seeing some horrible message,
or that you're just dumping me.

596
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,183
And when you're not with me,
I imagine that you just

597
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,120
don't even miss me,
you don't even miss me!

598
00:42:35,145 --> 00:42:39,802
And when we are together...
it's fake, it's not real!

599
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:43,661
I just imagine you going out

600
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,263
and finding someone
to replace me so easily.

601
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:49,926
And now I can actually
visualize that person,

602
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:52,240
and it's my best friend
in the whole entire world

603
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,748
who's amazing and brilliant, who I love,

604
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:59,334
but I have always felt this big
in comparison.

605
00:43:01,114 --> 00:43:03,373
And it's not your fault.

606
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,738
It's not your fault.

607
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:12,794
But this...

608
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:16,989
is just too shitty, to constantly

609
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:21,724
anticipate what you're gonna say
and what you're gonna do.

610
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:27,266
I just want to enjoy a
moment like everybody else,

611
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:29,539
but I don't.

612
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:34,186
I'm sorry.
- Listen, Dolore.

613
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,891
If I had met you before Sinead,

614
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,461
before any other girl I've ever met,

615
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:41,619
I would never have gone
looking for anyone else.

616
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:46,999
And I am not...
any other person you've ever been with.

617
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:51,889
I'm not!

618
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:55,766
How can I convince you?

619
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:58,842
You can't.

620
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:05,505
Come on.

621
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:09,232
Dolore listen, listen...

622
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,701
I will never, ever hurt you.

623
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:15,763
Okay listen to me, listen to me,
I love you, okay?

624
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16,982
Okay?

625
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:19,005
I will never hurt you!

626
00:44:19,037 --> 00:44:20,905
Don't you believe me?

627
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,966
No, I don't.

628
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:52,269
How did it go?

629
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:54,497
Well, I...

630
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:56,986
called her out for ignoring me.

631
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:59,685
Told her how I feel, I...

632
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,294
told her we could work through this,

633
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:05,669
That she trust me.

634
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,304
Coffee, man.

635
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:13,490
And did you guys wanna do some food?

636
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:14,770
Think we're good.

637
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:16,356
Okay.

638
00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:25,426
I told her that I loved her.
- Were you telling the truth?

639
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,497
For the first time in my life,
it was actually true.

640
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,697
For the first time in my life,
it wasn't very persuasive.

641
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:40,658
I'm really sorry, Riun.
- It's okay.

642
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:43,424
It just means it's your turn.

643
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:47,565
Yeah.

644
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:50,541
I know.

645
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:53,674
Have you heard anything from her?
- No, nothing.

646
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:01,496
You know, you just, you
can't tell her anything.

647
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,493
It's like she just keeps
everything so deep in

648
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:05,737
that big fucking heart of hers,
and it doesn't matter

649
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,593
how many times you tell
her that you adore her,

650
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:10,011
that I adore her, she just...

651
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,114
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

652
00:46:21,808 --> 00:46:23,808
She's just so sensitive.

653
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:26,208
She is.

654
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:31,416
Sinead...

655
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,557
I really don't wanna lose her.

656
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:40,471
Yeah... neither do I.

657
00:46:45,062 --> 00:46:47,218
I suck at everything.

658
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,203
That's the spirit.

659
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,234
I'm gonna try again.

660
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,283
All right.

661
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,138
Sinead, I don't wanna see you right now.

662
00:47:08,163 --> 00:47:11,893
Dolore, I'm sorry, but we need to talk.
- I really can't.

663
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,130
Is that a pool noodle?

664
00:47:17,155 --> 00:47:18,506
Yeah, I was babysitting
at my aunts house,

665
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,239
and I thought it would come in handy.

666
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:25,349
Hey, stop!

667
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:26,888
Come on, okay, what's...

668
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:29,857
a little carnal knowledge
between two best friends?

669
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:31,071
Go away.

670
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:35,263
Dolore, you can't just ignore me
and expect me to go away.

671
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:38,950
All right, we're bajango sisters,

672
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:43,044
so many girlfriends are, and you know,
it could actually be to our betterment.

673
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,677
We can have a stronger
friendship because now

674
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:47,989
we can swap stories about his balls.

675
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,896
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

676
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:52,240
You know you are completely overreacting.

677
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:55,474
Yeah Sinead, my feelings
are completely illegitimate.

678
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,723
Now go away!

679
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:59,115
Don't be stupid, no one
said you're not entitled

680
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,810
to be embarrassed or hurt,
or pissed off, okay?

681
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:05,395
But you know that feeling
that way is irrational

682
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,803
because it didn't mean anything,
what happened between me and Riun.

683
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:11,701
It doesn't mean that what you
have with him isn't special,

684
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:14,670
it doesn't mean that he prefers me to you,

685
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,974
it doesn't mean that you can't trust him,

686
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:20,396
and it doesn't mean
that I am better than you.

687
00:48:21,874 --> 00:48:22,968
Okay?

688
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:26,368
It only means those things
if you decide it does.

689
00:48:26,765 --> 00:48:28,607
I should've known, Sinead.

690
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:30,084
I should've known that you've fucked

691
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,076
so many people that one day it would turn
out to be somebody important.

692
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:36,827
Okay.

693
00:48:37,826 --> 00:48:39,646
You're angry at me, fine.

694
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:41,459
But I'm gonna take you out,

695
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:43,818
and we are actually going
to do something to fix this.

696
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,287
I'm not going anywhere with you.

697
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:46,362
Dolore...

698
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,734
I am not gonna let you
destroy our friendship

699
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,271
and wallow in your apartment
eating fucking Oreos.

700
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,459
Yeah?

701
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:57,170
What are you gonna do about it,
you curly haired munchkin?

702
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:01,816
Get in the car!

703
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:04,424
Get in the car, get in the car!

704
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,147
Watching you!

705
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:10,654
Stay put!

706
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:18,898
Hey, don't! I swear to god,
if you

707
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,188
touch that handle, I will rip out

708
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:23,761
every hair on your pretty little head.

709
00:49:30,828 --> 00:49:34,244
I like this white girl...
she's got spunk.

710
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:55,090
You shouldn't text and drive.

711
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:00,457
Where are we even going?

712
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:04,738
I'll tell you when we get there.

713
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:07,832
It's not like it matters anyways.

714
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:11,816
Can't you see how hard she's trying?

715
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,496
Putting up with your attitude.

716
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,988
All this is for you...

717
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:18,871
for your friendship.

718
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,924
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

719
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,469
You know I'm frustrated with you

720
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:30,375
for doing this to yourself...

721
00:50:30,399 --> 00:50:32,288
for being willing to throw away

722
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:34,305
two good relationships in your life,

723
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,821
over something so insignificant.

724
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,049
But I'm really hurt...

725
00:50:42,096 --> 00:50:44,029
that you would do this to me.

726
00:50:45,363 --> 00:50:47,190
That you would consider...

727
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:50,065
cutting me lose and...

728
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,088
never seeing me again.

729
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:56,315
Because you're my best friend...

730
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:00,518
and I can't imagine anything worse
than losing you.

731
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,015
And it sucks to know that
you don't feel the same way.

732
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,959
No, no, no!

733
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,051
Okay, we're here.

734
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:25,731
Why are we here?
Why are...

735
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:28,121
I don't even like this neighborhood,
this is dumb,

736
00:51:28,146 --> 00:51:30,732
I just wanna go home.
- Okay, okay!

737
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:32,287
Okay, you know what?

738
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:37,013
I'm gonna tell you something that I have
been keeping from you for a long time.

739
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:38,802
Let me guess, you fucked my dad.

740
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:42,994
Okay, can you just stop being
an asshole for one second?

741
00:51:45,492 --> 00:51:46,781
All right, so...

742
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:51,031
remember the dick that got away,
my friendly ghost Casper?

743
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:52,492
Yeah, okay.

744
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,998
Okay, well while we were dating, there...

745
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:58,334
was this one time that
he slept over at my house,

746
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:02,281
hell, and in the night I woke up, and...

747
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,711
I heard him say your name in his sleep.

748
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:09,172
I know, it wrecked me.

749
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:12,554
And I... I just, I liked him so much, and

750
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,664
and, and I'd liked him more
than I had liked anyone

751
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:17,804
in a really long time, and the
fact that he said your name

752
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:22,289
just confirmed everything that I was
afraid of, that he was into you.

753
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:24,953
And I just went kind of crazy,

754
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,617
I just, I kept thinking about you guys.

755
00:52:26,642 --> 00:52:28,812
I kept thinking about
him leaving me for you,

756
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:32,015
I kept thinking about,
about like you guys conspiring

757
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,640
to fornicate behind my back,

758
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:38,117
and I, it just, it just, it just overcame
me and I felt so pathetic,

759
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:41,506
and it was constant, and
the worst part was that it

760
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:45,273
wasn't safe to tell my best friend.

761
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:49,422
Sinead, I don't know why you
would ever feel threatened by me.

762
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:52,172
I know, it doesn't make sense...

763
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:54,582
but that's how I felt.

764
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:57,492
Dolore...

765
00:52:58,563 --> 00:53:01,172
you're not the only one who feels like

766
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:04,851
they don't measure up to their
best friend all the time.

767
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:11,792
Okay, so then why are you
telling me this here, at this bar?

768
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:15,276
Because Casper is in this bar.

769
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:20,634
And I think that in order for
us to get back on even ground,

770
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:24,589
for you to feel like you got back
whatever you think I took from you,

771
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,822
that you need to go in there
and hit that.

772
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:29,089
What, no!

773
00:53:29,114 --> 00:53:32,011
Okay, well then just back on it then.
- No, Sinead, no, come on.

774
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:33,728
I know that you are angry at me,

775
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,917
you feel vulnerable, you want validation,

776
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:37,986
and you wanna get back at Riun,

777
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:39,784
so why don't we just

778
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:43,284
kill all those birds
with one hot make out session?

779
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:47,089
Sinead, I appreciate that
you're trying to fix things...

780
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,784
but this, this is really stupid.

781
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,533
I am not gonna have sex with
your long lost summer love Casper.

782
00:53:53,558 --> 00:53:56,589
Stupid, oh my god, do you
know what's good for you?

783
00:53:56,614 --> 00:53:59,112
Not always.
- Are you willing to do...

784
00:53:59,137 --> 00:54:01,486
anything else to try
to save our friendship?

785
00:54:01,511 --> 00:54:02,884
No.
- All right.

786
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,814
Well I'm not willing to just sit around
and do nothing,

787
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:06,456
so until you come up with your

788
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,526
grown up, responsible plan,

789
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:10,850
we're gonna do my stupid plan!

790
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:15,378
So why don't you get in
there and get that sweet D.

791
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:19,496
<i>But I don't wanna have to
buy you drinks every time...</i>

792
00:54:19,497 --> 00:54:21,020
<i>every time something
good happens at work.</i>

793
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:22,651
<i>But I want you though.</i>

794
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:27,990
<i>I work at G Nelson.</i>

795
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:30,260
<i>It stands out, right.</i>

796
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:36,435
Dolore, hello.
- Oh, hey Casper.

797
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:38,607
Fancy seeing you here.

798
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:41,404
I haven't seen you in ages.
Where have you been hiding?

799
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:43,575
Oh, you know, around.

800
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,866
Well it's good seeing you again.

801
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,466
Hey, what are you doing,
are you here with anyone?

802
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:49,325
No, you know, I just...

803
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,107
came here to have a drink all by myself.

804
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:53,507
You can drink with us if you want, yeah?

805
00:54:53,508 --> 00:54:54,786
Yeah, cool, definitely.

806
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,990
We're cel...
celebrating Cameron's new job.

807
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:58,708
Congrats.
- I got a new job.

808
00:54:58,733 --> 00:54:59,677
It's a big deal.

809
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:02,879
Sorry, where are my manners?
Cameron, Dolore.

810
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:05,419
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

811
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:08,136
So what are you drinking?
- A beer...

812
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:11,091
but maybe you could buy me another one.

813
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:14,615
You should probably finish
that one first though, right?

814
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:16,592
Good advice.

815
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,825
Casper?

816
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:32,833
What have you been doing lately,
other than working out?

817
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:36,599
Well, I'm getting my degree
this year, completing that.

818
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:40,005
I took a year off to do
some volunteering in Haiti.

819
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:44,146
Wow, that is so interesting
and very upstanding of you.

820
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:45,763
Thank you, it's just...

821
00:55:46,536 --> 00:55:50,489
honestly it's just really,
really meaningful work.

822
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,021
What were you studying?

823
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:53,989
I'm getting a degree in urban planning.

824
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:57,255
UBC actually has one of the most larger
programs in the world.

825
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,606
Holly wow, that must have been
really tough to get through.

826
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,968
I enjoy the challenge, I find I excel

827
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,263
in those kind of environments, so.

828
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,285
So that's what you've
been doing lately, Casper?

829
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:14,363
That's what I've been
doing lately, Dolore.

830
00:56:16,794 --> 00:56:20,863
So who have you been
doing lately, Casper?

831
00:56:20,888 --> 00:56:21,800
I'm sorry...

832
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:24,675
I'm just curious, because you know,
a little munchkin

833
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,793
told me a secret.

834
00:56:25,818 --> 00:56:27,175
Yeah, what was that?

835
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,127
That you used to have a crush on me.

836
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,221
Is that so?

837
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:32,925
Yeah, don't be shy about
it, I think it's pretty neat.

838
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:36,566
Who said I was shy, I'm not
even saying that it's true.

839
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:38,707
I think it's great if it were true,

840
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,320
because I think that you're great,

841
00:56:40,345 --> 00:56:44,844
and you're pretty well
dressed, and great overall.

842
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:45,964
I dress myself.

843
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,433
Do you undress yourself?

844
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,765
Okay excuse me, what are you doing?

845
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,019
Seducing you, obvs.

846
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,839
Dolore, I'm gonna be honest,

847
00:56:55,864 --> 00:56:58,425
I find it really unattractive when girls...

848
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,660
Casper, what the hell is wrong with you?

849
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:03,550
She's practically giving it away,
why don't you wanna hit that?

850
00:57:03,575 --> 00:57:05,425
Dolore, what's going on here?

851
00:57:06,296 --> 00:57:08,144
I'm sorry, do I know you?

852
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:10,441
Are you freaking serious?

853
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:13,800
We dated for four months.

854
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,628
Sinead!

855
00:57:15,653 --> 00:57:18,691
I'm sorry, look, I didn't recognize you
with the curly hair.

856
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:21,082
Oh my god, do I really look that different
with curly hair?

857
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:22,899
No, you look terrific.

858
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:25,348
Okay Sinead, what's going on here.
Did you set this up?

859
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:27,262
We spent every other day together
for four months,

860
00:57:27,286 --> 00:57:30,144
I would remember you if you had
Renee Zellweger's plastic surgeon.

861
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:32,237
Look, I don't know what
you want me to say, and I...

862
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:35,043
still wanna know why your friend
is trying to get into my pants.

863
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:36,434
Wait a minute.

864
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:43,161
Did you not recognize me,
or did you not remember me?

865
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,098
Look, it took me a
second to recognize you

866
00:57:47,123 --> 00:57:49,856
'cause it's been a long time.
- Oh my God!

867
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,176
All right Sinead look,

868
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:54,918
I didn't remember you,
it took me a half second.

869
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,862
Please don't take it personally,
it's just...

870
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:58,893
it's been a really long time.
I mean...

871
00:57:58,918 --> 00:58:01,847
a lot has happened, a lot has changed
since you and I were together,

872
00:58:01,872 --> 00:58:05,097
and I'm sorry, you just haven't been
on the forefront of my mind lately.

873
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:07,012
But...

874
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:11,122
What?

875
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:17,173
Casper... I still think about you.

876
00:58:20,382 --> 00:58:21,649
That's okay.

877
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:26,353
Sinead...

878
00:58:26,743 --> 00:58:28,485
look, I remember you...

879
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:31,970
and I remember you fondly,
we had a great time together.

880
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:35,165
But...
in the end it was just four months,

881
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,267
what 2/5 of the decade ago.

882
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,212
I mean, I'm sorry...
- Just stop!

883
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,657
Fuck.

884
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:48,580
Way to ruin Cameron's night.

885
00:58:49,164 --> 00:58:52,331
Sinead!
- That hasn't been proven yet, has it?

886
00:58:59,681 --> 00:59:00,799
Sinead?

887
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:06,549
I'm just so embarrassed.
- No, don't be.

888
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:12,260
I'm sorry, this was supposed to be
about you and I just...

889
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:14,010
Don't worry about it.

890
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:18,603
I just feel so stupid.

891
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:22,002
You are amazing...

892
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:25,353
and extraordinary in a million ways,

893
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:29,002
and I've cherished every moment
we have ever had.

894
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,377
Thanks, Dolore.

895
00:59:32,186 --> 00:59:35,869
Any guy who doesn't see that,
doesn't deserve to be with you.

896
00:59:36,947 --> 00:59:38,854
Yeah, I know.

897
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:45,008
I'll be okay.

898
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,363
Fuck it... let's go get some gelato.

899
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:14,245
What?
- I'm sitting outside a bar crying.

900
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,608
I feel like I'm 19, and I
wanna go get some gelato.

901
01:00:19,273 --> 01:00:20,960
I don't understand.

902
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:27,413
I don't understand how yo...

903
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:32,601
how you can just pull
yourself together and...

904
01:00:33,312 --> 01:00:37,046
get up and leave after going
through something like that.

905
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:42,023
I'm not stronger than you.

906
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,788
I don't have anything that you don't have.

907
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:47,624
It sure seems like you do.

908
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:50,968
I just don't let other people
make me feel small

909
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:52,937
because I know that I'm not.

910
01:01:01,136 --> 01:01:05,206
Dolore, do you know why this thing
with Riun upsets you so much?

911
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:09,518
Why you were ready to throw away
our friendship over it?

912
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,392
It's not because someone else
doesn't think that you're special,

913
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,339
doesn't think that you're lovable.

914
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,362
It's because you don't think you are.

915
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:27,901
And it breaks my heart, because I...

916
01:01:27,926 --> 01:01:30,792
I wanna show you, and I wanna tell you.

917
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,540
But...

918
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:38,044
you need to believe it for yourself.

919
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,292
It's okay.

920
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:55,839
I still love that big, huge heart...

921
01:02:58,084 --> 01:02:59,886
even though it's sensitive.

922
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:04,545
Show you around this week?

923
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:08,834
That would be nice.

924
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:14,527
You wanna do a brunch?

925
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:18,781
Oh my god!

926
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:22,082
I would love to do brunch,
I just love brunch.

927
01:03:22,107 --> 01:03:24,832
Like I could definitely do
brunch, it's my favorite.

928
01:03:25,649 --> 01:03:26,917
Okay.

929
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,550
It's a date.

930
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:31,167
Bye.

931
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,334
If you're looking for a strong...

932
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:01,759
confident...

933
01:04:02,249 --> 01:04:03,827
fearless woman?

934
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:09,413
Enough staring at that poster and
start looking in the mirror.

935
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:16,496
I really wish I could
see myself that way.

936
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:21,168
You know I wasn't born Fierce.

937
01:04:22,419 --> 01:04:25,230
I chose to define myself that way.

938
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:30,300
I decide who I am each and every day.

939
01:04:32,304 --> 01:04:34,374
Don't let yourself be defeated.

940
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,328
You can choose to...

941
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:41,390
you can be fierce.

942
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:50,916
I am fierce?

943
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:07,124
I tried to make out with someone tonight,
I didn't want to though.

944
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:09,209
It's okay.

945
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:12,874
I figured you and Sinead
would be up to something crazy.

946
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:14,279
I...

947
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:17,866
I came by to tell you that I also

948
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:20,757
wanna do whatever it takes
to hang onto you.

949
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:23,664
And like...

950
01:05:23,973 --> 01:05:25,496
well, literally because

951
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,637
you're a great hugger
and you're really tall, and

952
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:32,006
but also like less literally.

953
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:39,434
I just don't think this
is gonna be easy for me,

954
01:05:40,347 --> 01:05:44,080
and I really can't imagine it
being any easier for you.

955
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:46,849
I'm gonna need a lot of reassurance...

956
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:49,378
a lot of honesty...

957
01:05:50,331 --> 01:05:51,481
and...

958
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:54,581
I'm gonna be unreasonable...

959
01:05:54,606 --> 01:05:58,870
like really unreasonable...
- Dolore it's... not a burden for me.

960
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:03,620
I'm always gonna be here
to look out for you.

961
01:06:04,613 --> 01:06:06,636
I really care about you.

962
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:11,268
I just don't think I can say
I love you...

963
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:13,542
back... right now,

964
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:15,784
but I think that I can.

965
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,214
Is that okay?

966
01:06:19,448 --> 01:06:21,893
I don't need you to love me right away.

967
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,839
I do need you to trust me.

968
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:35,323
I... I can't promise not to be scared...

969
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:40,542
but I do promise to be courageous.

970
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,404
How you doin' over there?

971
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:02,771
I love you.

972
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:09,130
You are so beautiful.

973
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:14,756
And you're really funny.

974
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,849
You're completely cool, you know that?

975
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:27,533
Baby, I don't know.
