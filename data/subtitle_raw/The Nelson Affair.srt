1
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,346
Oh, Minto, it's you.

2
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,808
I was looking for some
dull admiralty official.

3
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,352
Yeah, and the guard of honour,

4
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,937
and your usual crowd.

5
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,677
Yes.

6
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,249
And you better have
a pretty good reason

7
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,443
for landing me like a
smuggler in this little hole.

8
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,819
We're off, Nelson.

9
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,320
Best respects, my lord.

10
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,572
Aye-aye.

11
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,740
Pack it on.

12
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,826
Stand by.

13
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,327
Give way together.

14
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,083
And you cannot fool crowds,
especially not English ones.

15
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,461
They'll find out that I've landed,

16
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,587
head straight for London.

17
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,546
Aye, my lord.

18
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,339
You have changes of horses?

19
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,423
- Yep.
- Good.

20
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,301
We're due at the
admiralty in the morning.

21
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,147
Now, why the secrecy?

22
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,942
Because if we'd landed
you among a crowd,

23
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,027
and the word had spread

24
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,321
that you were back in
England after two years

25
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,404
and no longer out there

26
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,447
keeping the French away,

27
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,700
we might have started to panic.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,787
Well, I must say you haven't the air

29
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,870
of a man who's dying.

30
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,915
Oh, by your own reports,

31
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,209
of every illness known to medicine.

32
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,296
Well, I had to exaggerate a little.

33
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,217
I have a fever of the blood.

34
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,053
You more than most
people know its name.

35
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,596
Aye, I know its name.

36
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,015
Everyone in Europe knows its name,

37
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,893
but after a couple of years
absence from the lady,

38
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,686
I thought, well, some of us thought...

39
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,842
every second of every minute

40
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,065
of that two years absence
from Emma Hamilton

41
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,526
has been a torment.

42
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,781
You could tell that to the admiralty.

43
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,864
I'll tell them myself.

44
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,077
I'm not wearing this
damn thing on shore.

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,704
And besides, Emma hates it.

46
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,875
How is it?

47
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,633
Where would she be
waiting for me, in London?

48
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,593
No, she's at Merton,

49
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,303
preparing for your arrival

50
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,431
as befits the mistress
of the household.

51
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,017
A small detour from this
road will come to Merton.

52
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,435
It won't take long.

53
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,979
It will take two hours.

54
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:54,938
Well, two hours, is it?

55
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,108
And 12 hours more after that.

56
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,486
No, I've promised to deliver
you straight to the admiralty,

57
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,990
and straight to the admiralty
I shall deliver you.

58
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:16,710
Lord Nelson, it is my
present duty to extend to you

59
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,255
the lords of the
admiralty's firm in thanks,

60
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,966
and heartfelt congratulations

61
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,010
on your most recent operations.

62
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,433
After an unremitting
cruises of two long years

63
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,894
in the stormy seas off Toulon,

64
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,813
to have proceeded
without going into port

65
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,649
to Alexandria from the west Indies,

66
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,693
back again to Gibraltar,

67
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,112
to have kept your ships afloat,

68
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,822
your rigging standing...

69
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,907
barely.

70
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,451
Yes, quite so.

71
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,247
You have protected England
for two long years,

72
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,792
and have saved the west
Indies by only a few days.

73
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,174
I think there was some more,

74
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,343
but I've seemed to have
misplaced the other sheet.

75
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,178
Which is just as well, perhaps,

76
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,096
since my idiocy in chasing violence

77
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,806
across the Atlantic and back

78
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,726
could have put Bonaparte
on the throne of England.

79
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,937
But it didn't, lord Nelson,

80
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,105
all thanks to your name.

81
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,565
Did he know my name?

82
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,109
You must know that he did.

83
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,655
I like you.

84
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,032
They said I wouldn't, but I do.

85
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,742
Where is violence now?

86
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,952
At Ferrol.

87
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,745
Collingwood's latest dispatch

88
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,580
gives it that
Villeneuve's about to sail.

89
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,831
He won't do that.

90
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,167
Bonaparte is no
seaman, but he's not mad.

91
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,002
Villeneuve will stay in Ferrol.

92
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,339
And that is your
estimation, lord Nelson?

93
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,800
It's the estimation of
a humble flag officer,

94
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,177
but I'll have a Guinea on
it, if you're a betting man.

95
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,432
And how long do you think
he will stay at Ferrol?

96
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,476
Long enough to give me a fair leave.

97
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,274
Lord Barham, I've come home
to beg you and their lordships

98
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,944
to give me some
months' rest from battle.

99
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,779
Did you say months?

100
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,863
Yes, I did.

101
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,242
There's a promise that
I've made a certain lady

102
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,232
from whom I've been wholly
separated for two years,

103
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,400
and who is happy to have me home.

104
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,413
Yes, yes, I see.

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,250
Well, now that the immediate
danger of invasion is past,

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,544
you can of course take some few weeks.

107
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,921
God knows you deserve that, my lord.

108
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,134
And perhaps after that,
her ladyship may relent.

109
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,760
I doubt it, my lord.

110
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,470
In a matter of being
separated from me,

111
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,056
her ladyship is not a
very relenting person.

112
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,017
Perhaps if I wrote to her myself.

113
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,437
Remind me, would you Minto,
to write to lady Nelson?

114
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,816
I think it was to another ladyship

115
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,484
that lord Nelson was referring.

116
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,820
Oh, yes.

117
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,072
I'm very sorry, my lord.

118
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,702
Nevertheless, I trust
lady Nelson is well.

119
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,454
I haven't the faintest idea.

120
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,622
She now lives in bath, I believe,

121
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,667
where the waters no doubt will
help her various infirmities,

122
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,169
real and imagined.

123
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,920
Now, if we've finished our business,

124
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,505
I'd like to take my leave.

125
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,257
By all means.

126
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,800
Can I have your promise that,

127
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,511
only if Villeneuve sails north,

128
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,473
will you call on my services
within the next few months?

129
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,308
You have that promise.

130
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,185
And you've accepted my Guinea bet

131
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,271
that anyway, he won't
come out of Ferrol?

132
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,733
Shall we make it five?

133
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,737
Done.

134
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,801
Lady Nelson, a most present surprise.

135
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,970
I'd almost thought you'd
given up taking our orders.

136
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,138
Thank you, Mr. Long.

137
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,690
Very good, please, for
the viscountess Nelson.

138
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,784
Yes, we're all mentioned.

139
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,037
Lord Nelson has invited all
the members of his family

140
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,497
to stay with him at Merton.

141
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,376
Among the residents of bath,
so honoured are Mr. and Mrs...

142
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,712
George, don't look to your right.

143
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,327
I wasn't looking to
my right, I was reading.

144
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,173
It's her.

145
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,258
It's tomtit.

146
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,428
How dare she come to the
pamplum in the afternoon?

147
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,721
Well, it's free.

148
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,563
Oh, she saw that.

149
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,022
So did the whole pamplum.

150
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,191
Go on reading.

151
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,442
Ah, yes.

152
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,695
Who leave on their joyous expedition

153
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,155
to London tomorrow morning.

154
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,449
Their young son,
George Matcham Jr.,

155
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,951
nephew to lord Nelson,

156
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,194
who must surely count himself

157
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,037
the most fortunate boy in England,

158
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,873
leaves next Saturday to join them.

159
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,718
You smiled at tomtit.

160
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,344
She smiled first.

161
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,988
I've told you and told you about that.

162
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,347
God knows it's hard enough

163
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,503
that we should all be living together

164
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,058
in the same small town.

165
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,311
But whenever you meet her, George,

166
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:31,399
what you must do is to treat
her as if she didn't exist.

167
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,027
I hope you do consider
yourself the most fortunate boy

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,236
in all of England.

169
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,447
Oh yes, I do.

170
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,242
Will lady Hamilton
be at clergy street?

171
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,828
I don't know, dear.

172
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,914
Will he be at clergy street?

173
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
No.

174
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,212
You see, George, for him to
stay with her at clergy street

175
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,421
would hardly be proper.

176
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,006
But she stays at Merton.

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,301
Merton is your uncle's residence.

178
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,679
Lady Hamilton stays
there as his guest.

179
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,932
Well, why can't he
stay at clergy street?

180
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,309
That's her guest.

181
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,978
Don't speak with
your mouth full, dear.

182
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,063
Sorry.

183
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,524
Well, why can't he?

184
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,693
And don't ask foolish
questions, either.

185
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,695
Father, can you tell me?

186
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,573
No, frankly, George, I can't.

187
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,909
Since they live openly
together at Merton...

188
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,244
oh, don't call it that.

189
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,495
What, openly or together?

190
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,579
Together.

191
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,998
George might get quite
the wrong impression.

192
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,626
Together implies something.

193
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,921
It implies together.

194
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,089
That's how they live.

195
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,676
I'll explain it all
to you later, George.

196
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,801
We must go now.

197
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,096
Yes, mum.

198
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,934
Hmm.

199
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,765
Now, pass your exams tomorrow.

200
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,435
If not, the headmaster
might not let you come.

201
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,769
What would you do then, eh?

202
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,354
I'd kill him.

203
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,400
Now remember, George, to
be on your best behaviour

204
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,693
when you come to Merton.

205
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,195
You're not scared, are you?

206
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Oh, no, not of him.

207
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,824
But I will be of her, I think.

208
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,159
Well, you needn't be.

209
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,077
She's the most lovable soul alive.

210
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,537
Is she not, my dear?

211
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,700
Lovable is an accurate
enough description of a lady

212
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,542
who, in her day, has
been greatly loved.

213
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,629
And who is now undoubtedly
loved by our host.

214
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,672
Thank you.

215
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,467
It is much more than just love.

216
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,261
What can be more than just love?

217
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,055
Oh, something altogether higher,

218
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,765
nothing gross or physical.

219
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,018
Something, well, ethereal.

220
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,227
Ethereal?

221
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,479
Of the ether.

222
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,941
The air, spiritual, not
of the flesh at all.

223
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,526
Come along, clear, or we'll be late.

224
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,486
Joseph.

225
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,612
Goodbye, George.

226
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,446
Goodbye.

227
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,655
Be a good boy.

228
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,713
Hello, master George.

229
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,090
Hello, Emily.

230
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,011
You've grown.

231
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,179
Have I?

232
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,349
I'm awfully sorry, Emily,

233
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,059
but I'm not supposed to speak to you.

234
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,143
Mother's ordered.

235
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,021
Well, I can't be doing with that.

236
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,775
Come along, master George.

237
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,001
Thank you for coming, George.

238
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,628
Please sit down.

239
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,298
I thank your ladyship,
but I would rather stand.

240
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,759
I won't insist,

241
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,263
but if you could call me aunt Frances,

242
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
as in the old days,

243
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,684
it might make our talk less formal.

244
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,810
Yes, aunt Frances.

245
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,358
You're growing fast, George.

246
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,154
When I saw you this afternoon,
I hardly recognised you.

247
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,905
But still, it has been six years.

248
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,910
By the way, thank
you for smiling at me.

249
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,609
Well, I shouldn't have,
because my mother said I...

250
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,373
oh, I saw you getting a tongue lashing

251
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,708
from your mother afterwards.

252
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,209
Yes, I am sorry about that.

253
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,838
But I have a little
present for you here,

254
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,008
to make up for it.

255
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,721
Six pounds?

256
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,484
Remember, I gave you
no Christmas present

257
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,724
these past six years.

258
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,310
Go on, take it.

259
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,563
What do you want me to do for it?

260
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,194
When you come back from Merton,

261
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,613
I should like you
to write me a letter,

262
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,450
telling me everything, every
smallest thing about my lord.

263
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,661
How he is, how he looks,

264
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,581
everything he says to you
that you can remember.

265
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,501
That's all.

266
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,252
That's not much, is it?

267
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,548
Isn't that a bit like spying?

268
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,051
I only want news of my husband.

269
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,761
Is that so wicked?

270
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,221
And about lady Hamilton?

271
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,640
No, no, no, this is
not about lady Hamilton.

272
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,977
In fact, George, I forbid you

273
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,271
to write one word about lady Hamilton.

274
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,399
Good.

275
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:12,365
Now, I want to know especially,
how is his good eye?

276
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,617
Does he still get those
terrible headaches?

277
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,371
And is his arm less painful?

278
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,166
And the cough that was so terrible.

279
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,910
He may not even talk to me,

280
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,629
because I've only seen
him twice in my life,

281
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,589
and that was when I was small.

282
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,091
Oh, he'll talk to you, George.

283
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,300
He loves young people,

284
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:37,139
and a kinder... a
gentler man never lived.

285
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,811
Of course, if you could let slip

286
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,481
that I should be overjoyed
to see him again.

287
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,275
Oh, not to talk, you understand.

288
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,651
It displeases him.

289
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,783
Oh dear, I forget how
I began this sentence.

290
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,202
It's a bad habit, George.

291
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,705
I mustn't keep you.

292
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,132
Goodbye, aunt Frances.

293
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,175
Anything at all about him, anything.

294
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,637
No matter how trivial
it may seem to you,

295
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,556
it won't seem so to me.

296
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,609
What did you do?

297
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,236
What does your mother say I did?

298
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,321
She won't tell me.

299
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,742
But she says it was very bad.

300
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,285
Perhaps it was.

301
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,411
Well, what was it?

302
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,706
I made him choose.

303
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,499
Well, that's not bad.

304
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,501
It was bad for him.

305
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,214
Now, let's change the subject.

306
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,926
Tell me, why do they
now call me tomtit?

307
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,389
- Don't you know?
- No.

308
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,932
It's the way you walk.

309
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,310
The way I walk?

310
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,103
Like the bird, you know.

311
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,439
How funny, I never thought...

312
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,232
Well, show me how I walk.

313
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,317
No.

314
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,109
Please go on.

315
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,944
Show me how they
imitate me in the family.

316
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,037
My old, rheumaticy legs.

317
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
Most birdlike, I see.

318
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,210
I never guessed it was my walk.

319
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,050
Is there, is there anything you want?

320
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,134
Shall I call Emily?

321
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,346
Forgive me George, forget it.

322
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,104
Do you ever write to him?

323
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,814
The last time I wrote to him

324
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,149
was at Christmas four years ago.

325
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,028
He sent the letter back to me marked,

326
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,157
"opened by mistake by lord
Nelson, but not read."

327
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,660
But that's something
sort of dishonourable,

328
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,453
and that's not possible.

329
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,956
I'm sorry, but I just
don't believe that.

330
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,586
That opens the right hand compartment

331
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,421
of the desk over there.

332
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,255
There's only one letter in it.

333
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,965
Take it out and look at the cover.

334
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,594
Oh no, George, no, don't.

335
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,057
Oh, please.

336
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,518
Don't read the letter itself.

337
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,647
I'm sorry, but I've just got to.

338
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,401
You see, he's my uncle, you see,

339
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,820
and he's Nelson.

340
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,453
Is this all?

341
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,583
There wasn't another
sheet with a postscript,

342
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,503
saying that lady Hamilton's
a whore or something?

343
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,174
No, dear George.

344
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,801
How fond I could have been of you,

345
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,344
had I only been allowed to.

346
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,222
No, there was no postscript
about lady Hamilton.

347
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,545
And there would've been a little point

348
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,917
in reminding him of the profession

349
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,894
unkind people say she once followed.

350
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,220
You're not trying to get me to believe

351
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,026
that lady Hamilton was, was...

352
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,237
I don't think anyone says
lady Hamilton is a whore now.

353
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,824
It would be good to think she were.

354
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,159
Unhappily, I do not.

355
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,953
No, there was no other sheet.

356
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,320
Lady Hamilton must have
recognised your writing

357
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,333
and opened it.

358
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,251
Of course, that's it.

359
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,128
She opened it and read it,

360
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,048
and then told lord Nelson
that it was a horrible letter,

361
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,508
which he mustn't read.

362
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,385
So then he sent it back to you.

363
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,054
That's how it must have been.

364
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,888
Don't you think?

365
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,015
Dear George,

366
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,268
I'm sure that's exactly
how it must have been.

367
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,355
Now put the letter back
in the compartment,

368
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,148
lock it, and give me the key.

369
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,515
Why don't I take it
down to give to him?

370
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,737
You'll certainly do no such thing.

371
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,573
Well, I'd hate it if
anyone thought uncle Horatio

372
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,993
was capable of such a cruel
and dishonourable thing

373
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,288
as to send back a
Christmas letter to a...

374
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,916
I really think I ought
to show it to him.

375
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,756
Now forget about it, George.

376
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,844
And just remember him as the
kind of man he really is,

377
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:25,970
as I do.

378
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,515
Goodbye, George.

379
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,227
It was good to see you again.

380
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,204
My respects, my lady.

381
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,248
And mine to you, sir.

382
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,817
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

383
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,746
Good morning.

384
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,747
Good morning.

385
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,248
I believe I'm expected.

386
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,332
I'm master Matcham.

387
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,375
Oh, yes.

388
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,336
Come in, come in.

389
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,632
Lord Nelson out now,

390
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,550
but I tell lady Hamilton you here, eh?

391
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,676
You wait here.

392
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,540
Eccellenza.

393
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,046
Master Matcham downstairs.

394
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,839
You must dress.

395
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,424
Not yet, you silly cow.

396
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,510
I've only had three hours sleep.

397
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,761
So many?

398
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,429
Three's more than he's giving you

399
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,056
every night since he come back.

400
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,434
How many times?

401
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,937
Oh, I can't remember.

402
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,523
There was one.

403
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,192
Seven, I think.

404
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,242
Another year and
he would've burst, pop.

405
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,536
Come, cognac?

406
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,671
I tell you, Eccellenza,
one night he'll die of it.

407
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,964
He'll die of it?

408
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,217
For you, Eccellenza,

409
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,053
70 times seven and still not die.

410
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,434
You are an impertinent cow,

411
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,061
and I don't know why
I bother to keep you.

412
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,896
Who'd you say was downstairs?

413
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,107
Younger boy, master Matcham.

414
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,734
Young George Matcham?

415
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:27,818
Yes.

416
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,392
He's never set eyes upon
me in his life before,

417
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,613
and I'm in this state.

418
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,906
Oh, Christ.

419
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,952
There's a lot of work to be done.

420
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,585
Lady Hamilton will see you in her bed.

421
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,669
Come.

422
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,839
Her bed?

423
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,132
No, no.

424
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,009
She received many
gentlemen in her bed.

425
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,510
Many, much bigger gentlemen.

426
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,597
No, but you see, I, I, I...

427
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Um...

428
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,148
My dearest little George Matcham.

429
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,358
Come here, let me give you a kiss.

430
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,990
My, aren't you handsome?

431
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,659
There's even a touch
of my Nelson about you.

432
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,621
In five years, I'll make
him jealous of you.

433
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,832
Well, it's a joke, George.

434
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,087
Oh, all the world knows
there's only one Nelson for me,

435
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,671
and that's my Nelson.

436
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,465
Aye, Francesca?

437
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,217
At seven times a night.

438
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,889
You must forgive Francesca, George,

439
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,015
she's from Naples,

440
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:41,642
where, as you know,

441
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,270
my late dear husband
William was our ambassador.

442
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,438
God rest his soul.

443
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,192
Oh, bugger it, all over the bed.

444
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,112
What was I saying?

445
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,685
I think it was
something about your maid.

446
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,574
Oh yes, Francesca.

447
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,034
She's a Neapolitan.

448
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,204
And her manners at times
are a trifle peasant-like.

449
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,957
Ooh.

450
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,167
This is a medicament,

451
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,671
prescribed by my doctors
for plaguing migraine.

452
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,215
It affects me in the
morning, from time to time.

453
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,592
What's in it?

454
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,845
A variety of ingredients.

455
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,722
All of the most efficacious,
I do assure you.

456
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,435
Ahh.

457
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,773
There, I feel better already.

458
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:33,735
I'm so glad.

459
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,239
Dear little George Matcham,

460
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,243
aren't you happy to be the
nephew of such a great man?

461
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,912
Yes, I am.

462
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,250
Great Jove himself,

463
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,128
immortal of all the immortals.

464
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,088
Hold me up, you silly cow.

465
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,464
You no eat nothing.

466
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,383
I bring you some perca pie, yes?

467
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,802
Oh, I don't know what my
stomach will hold this morning.

468
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,471
Might toy with a piece of cold mutton.

469
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,808
To bit, Eccellenza.

470
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,603
Eccellenza means excellency, George,

471
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,688
which of course in
Naples is what I was.

472
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,650
And to the queen of
Naples I was, guess what?

473
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,946
Carissima Mia, beloved friend.

474
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,073
And so she was to me, George.

475
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,742
And so she was.

476
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,065
Do you know she would sometimes

477
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,205
do me the honour of asking
me to share her bed?

478
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,790
And the king, he did
me much honour, too.

479
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,418
Of course, not quite in the same way.

480
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,003
Jesus.

481
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,546
It's a Neapolitan phrase, George.

482
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,173
They make much use of our lord's name,

483
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,383
and of the blessed virgin, too.

484
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,303
Of course, to our ears it
may sound a little common,

485
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,388
but one soon gets used to it.

486
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,974
As an ambassadress, one has to.

487
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,937
Ooh, I think I must have
drunk my medicine too first.

488
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,438
Yes, who is it?

489
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,790
Is your ladyship visible?

490
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,523
Minto.

491
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,234
Come in, come in.

492
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,359
Good morning, my dear.

493
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,195
Visible to you at any time.

494
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,321
Are you holding a levee?

495
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,864
At least I've risen.

496
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,201
This is young George Matcham,
my lord Nelson's nephew.

497
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,703
Oh, young master
Matcham, your servant, sir.

498
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,373
And this, George, is lord Minto,

499
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,500
your uncle's dearest friend.

500
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,001
My lord.

501
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,045
My Nelson vows he loves Minto

502
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,922
most of all persons in the world,

503
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,383
second only to me, aye, Minto?

504
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,884
A very poor second

505
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,346
for the competition
provided by your ladyship

506
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,140
is, to say the least, large.

507
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,019
Oh, you'd like me thin
as a wraith, aye, Minto?

508
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,312
A flag pole.

509
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,969
Perhaps you think my
Nelson would prefer me so,

510
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,275
that he could more
easily run up his flag?

511
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,358
Well, let me tell you.

512
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,736
His flag does quite
well enough as it is,

513
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,654
thank you very much.

514
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,407
Last night, it was nailed
to the mast at no surrender,

515
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,159
and the signals all at close action.

516
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,290
Oh dear, little George.

517
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,459
Little George, would
you like to run down

518
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,378
to my morning room while I dress?

519
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,338
Yes, my lady.

520
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,549
Don't call me my lady.

521
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,717
What shall I call you?

522
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,135
Aunt Emma, of course.

523
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,886
What else?

524
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,264
That is what I am in the sight of god.

525
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,016
Yes, aunt Emma.

526
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,226
Come here, give me a kiss.

527
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,352
Yes, aunt Emma.

528
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,771
Ah, little Georgie.

529
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,484
There.

530
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,862
Oh, leave all that.

531
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,018
Help me find something to wear

532
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,240
that won't make me look
like a curate's ass.

533
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,994
Oh, what a sweet boy.

534
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,038
I vow I love him already.

535
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,331
I know he loves me.

536
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,719
My bet, lord Barham.

537
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,639
I still don't understand
what madness made the fellow

538
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:55,520
leave Ferrol for Cadiz of all places.

539
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,899
Is it madness to
combine with the Spanish,

540
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,610
and make a battle fleet far larger

541
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,945
than anything we
could bring against him?

542
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,447
Reinforce Collingwood at once,

543
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,617
with every seaworthy vessel
your lordships can dispose of.

544
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,719
Collingwood, my lord?

545
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,703
You said Collingwood?

546
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,537
Yes.

547
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,831
You haven't relieved him
of his command, have you?

548
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,416
Oh, we propose to.

549
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,587
Lord Nelson, you are
here at our invitation,

550
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,423
to be offered the
supreme command yourself.

551
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,682
My lords, I'm deeply honoured.

552
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:33,558
What did he say?

553
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,851
He says he's deeply honoured.

554
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,313
I must nevertheless refuse,

555
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,733
as the first lord
should've told you I must.

556
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,276
How so, my lord?

557
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,112
Because you made me a solemn promise

558
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,989
that only if Villeneuve sailed north

559
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,492
would you call on my services.

560
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,731
Well, that promise was given

561
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,328
before the present
situation was known.

562
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,996
It was nevertheless a promise.

563
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,208
And on account of it,

564
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,377
I gave the same
promise to a certain lady.

565
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,382
If your lordships have any
further business with me,

566
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,758
you'll find me at Merton,

567
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,761
at least for the next few weeks.

568
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,405
Oh, come on, Minto,
don't just sit there.

569
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,158
Pull for the shore, is it?

570
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,242
Right.

571
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,764
Where were you last night?

572
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,373
The court ball, I suppose.

573
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,207
Yes, yes.

574
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,251
I was surprised not to see you there.

575
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,312
That's a poxy lie, you
knew we wouldn't be asked.

576
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,504
Oh, an oversight, surely.

577
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,339
An oversight, my ass.

578
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,633
They won't have us at any price.

579
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,927
I don't mind for myself.

580
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,304
I do mind for him.

581
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,433
Two years away, the west Indies saved,

582
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,560
not so much as a shipped
biscuit at the palace.

583
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,811
It's all because of me.

584
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,940
Still, it'll take more than
a snub from those Hanovers

585
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:04,774
to separate us.

586
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,942
And it will take more

587
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,903
than all you meddling
politicians, too.

588
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,987
Meddling, my lady?

589
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,656
You think I don't know what goes on

590
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,658
in your lords and commons?

591
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,786
"How the devil can we separate Nelson

592
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,331
from that Hamilton bitch?"

593
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,540
Well, it won't work.

594
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,625
Do you hear?

595
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,628
There's not one of you who
can separate us this time.

596
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,671
He has given me his
promise, and that is that.

597
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,632
I can't wear that thing.

598
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,218
It makes me look like an ageing
governess eight months gone.

599
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,135
Try the orange silk.

600
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,386
Well, what do you say?

601
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,251
Oh, I'm sure the orange
silk would go perfectly...

602
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,724
oh, rig the orange silk.

603
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,393
I am talking about the
conspiracy by the admiralty

604
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,063
to send my Nelson out to Cadiz again.

605
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,980
And don't try and tell me

606
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,595
that you and your precious politicians

607
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,025
haven't had a hand in that.

608
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,361
Damn you, you all try to separate us.

609
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,238
Not I, my lady.

610
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,573
Why can none of you understand?

611
00:33:56,368 --> 00:34:00,413
England needs a live, healthy Nelson,

612
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:05,043
not a Nelson broken and sick
and half-dead from longing.

613
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,714
That Hamilton bitch.

614
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,384
Perhaps I am.

615
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,681
But I'm the woman he wants
and who can make him happy.

616
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,101
Oh, Neapolitan ape,

617
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,144
the one with the
frills with less up here.

618
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,854
They all like a bit of titty fill out.

619
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,527
That you have enemies in
certain circles, I know.

620
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,406
But never count me among them.

621
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:39,244
Oh, you disapprove, too.

622
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,955
I neither approve or disapprove.

623
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,039
I accept.

624
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,147
Au revoir, master Matcham,

625
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,815
I shall be seeing you at Merton?

626
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,317
Yes, my lord.

627
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,401
Good.

628
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,953
Master Matcham,

629
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:28,335
you have about you a certain look.

630
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,919
Before you arrive at Merton,

631
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,838
you'd do well to remove it.

632
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,341
It will not be popular there.

633
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,634
What look, my lord?

634
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,474
It's a look of shock, master Matcham,

635
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,936
and is not uncommon among
those friends of lord Nelson

636
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,564
who meet lady
Hamilton for the first time.

637
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,360
But remove it, sir, I beg you.

638
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,654
Your uncle will not like it.

639
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,408
Are you fond of lady Hamilton?

640
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,579
You seem, master Matcham,

641
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,957
to have inherited your uncle's
flare for surprise attacks.

642
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,668
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,795
No, don't be.

644
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,883
I always tell the truth,

645
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,802
except when I need to tell a lie.

646
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,264
Yes, I am fond of Emma Hamilton.

647
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,017
She's a very generous,
good-hearted lady.

648
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,771
Loyal, passionate, and kind.

649
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,941
You'd better have some wine.

650
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,609
You still have that look.

651
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,612
No, thank you.

652
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,364
But if you could,

653
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,742
but if you could only explain...

654
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,786
Explain what?

655
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,329
Oh, it doesn't matter.

656
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,164
Well, I think it does matter,

657
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,459
to you and to some hundreds
of thousands in this land.

658
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:56,172
You want to know what your
uncle sees in lady Hamilton

659
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,425
to love her so
passionately, is that it?

660
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,554
He sees that.

661
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:04,723
Oh, he can't.

662
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,641
He can, and he does.

663
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:12,564
Master Matcham, let
me just tell you this,

664
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,315
as adult to adolescent.

665
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,568
That question,

666
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,321
"what does one person
see in another person?"

667
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,451
Has been asked since
the beginning of time,

668
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,204
and will be asked to the end of it.

669
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:34,002
And dear, young master Matcham,

670
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,174
there is never, never any answer.

671
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,717
But what about his honour?

672
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,636
Well, that's not a word
I'm accustomed to use,

673
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,722
as I never really know what it means.

674
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,141
It would appear

675
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,019
that you've been seeing
your aunt Frances in bath.

676
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,020
How did you know?

677
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,356
Oh, when people start
talking about honour,

678
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,971
it usually means
they've done something

679
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,651
they're ashamed of themselves.

680
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,195
Have you been seeing your late aunt?

681
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,613
She's not late.

682
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,532
She's alive and that's the trouble.

683
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,243
Master Matcham, you have the gift

684
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,120
for telling a profound truth

685
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,372
with a minimum of verbiage.

686
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,166
Therefore, and thank god for it,

687
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,418
you'll have no future in politics.

688
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,672
Your aunt Frances is still alive.

689
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,760
Tell me, when you saw
her, were there any tears?

690
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,584
She cried the way I've
never seen anyone cry before

691
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,722
in my whole life.

692
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,599
Not a grown up, that is.

693
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,101
She cried from deep,
deep down in herself.

694
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,186
It was terrible.

695
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,064
And I'll never forget
it as long as I live.

696
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,399
You must forget it, master Matcham,

697
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,278
for your own good and everyone else's.

698
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,907
In fact, I urge you to
obliterate the incident

699
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,700
utterly from your touching,

700
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,703
but as yet undeveloped mind.

701
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,582
Forget it, master Matcham.

702
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,596
I declare, look at that crowd!

703
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,976
Free Nelson!

704
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,328
Minto, you rat.

705
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,873
Don't desert me, come and rescue me.

706
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,666
And be killed for my pains?

707
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,377
Anyway, since when did
Nelson want rescuing?

708
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,091
You are a cowardly,
treacherous speechmaker.

709
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,360
Close the door, John.

710
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,952
Have you kept your promise?

711
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,078
Did you doubt me?

712
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,164
That poxy admiralty,
I always doubt you.

713
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,528
Did you tell them you
wouldn't go out again?

714
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Yes, my love.

715
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,252
And I've so displeased their lordships

716
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,796
that perhaps I'll never
be asked to go out again.

717
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,799
Let it be never again.

718
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,095
Oh, you don't mean that.

719
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,807
I do.

720
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,101
I do.

721
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,771
I do.

722
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,689
Oh, there's little George.

723
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,733
It's George Matcham, your nephew.

724
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,568
Come out of there.

725
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,488
Oh, George Matcham.

726
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,323
Well, I haven't seen
you for a long time.

727
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,867
Hello, uncle.

728
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
Hello, nephew.

729
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,164
Well, you've grown so much
I didn't recognise you.

730
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,084
Emma, pray attend to your attire.

731
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,487
Oh, you're such a prude, Nelson.

732
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,784
The people out there have seen
me stark naked in their day,

733
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,797
and they love it.

734
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,830
These crowds are a
confounded nuisance, George,

735
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,137
and I sometimes long to
walk in London unrecognised.

736
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,182
Perhaps, uncle Horatio,

737
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,934
if you didn't wear all those, um,

738
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,144
stars and decorations...

739
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,647
He got you there, Nelson.

740
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,399
George is right.

741
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,275
Vanity is my traitor.

742
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,695
Oh no, I didn't,

743
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,529
I didn't mean that.

744
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,571
Yes, you did.

745
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,574
I may be vain in such matters,

746
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,077
but dammit, I'd like people
to know what I've done.

747
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,412
Yes.

748
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,498
Here comes Hardy.

749
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,375
Not as soul's recognising him.

750
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,198
He's not getting so much
as a pat on the back.

751
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,795
Your flag captain?

752
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,963
Yes.

753
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,465
Emma, I do think that your
state of undress is not...

754
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,591
oh, I know, I know.

755
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,678
Dressed or undressed, Hardy
thinks I'm the whore of Babylon.

756
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,309
All right, John.

757
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,644
It's captain Hardy.

758
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,566
Hardy.

759
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,452
Welcome home, your lordship.

760
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,498
This is my nephew, George Matcham.

761
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,417
Captain Hardy, my right hand man.

762
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,627
Master Matcham?

763
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,172
Come in here.

764
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,875
Wouldn't you rather be alone?

765
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,888
No.

766
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,085
You've come from the admiralty?

767
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:38,848
Yes.

768
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,931
Is the news true?

769
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,350
Yes.

770
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,478
Well, when does the victory sail?

771
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,188
I don't doubt, captain,

772
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,064
that you'll get your orders

773
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,066
to sail the victory
south in a few days

774
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,526
to join admiral Collingwood's command.

775
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,322
Yes, my lord.

776
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,784
Excuse me.

777
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,494
I have to go to her ladyship.

778
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,427
Forgive me, master Matcham.

779
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,831
I've never cared for French wine.

780
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,888
I prefer rum.

781
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,641
Wouldn't you know it?

782
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,101
There isn't any.

783
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,787
What kind of an admiral's lady, is it,

784
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,020
that doesn't keep rum?

785
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,355
Nothing but foreign muck.

786
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,149
Oh, here's something.

787
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:30,983
Gin.

788
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,568
A whore's drink.

789
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,446
In the circumstances, quite
suitable, don't you think?

790
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,427
How long have you
been his flag captain?

791
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,915
Six years, on and off.

792
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,126
More on than off, thank god.

793
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,585
Now it appears to be off.

794
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,089
But you must know him as
well as anyone alive, then.

795
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,423
Oh yes, I suppose I do.

796
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,718
Well, let's say I know the man at sea.

797
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,972
The man ashore, that
seems a different matter.

798
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,102
In your view, captain Hardy,

799
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,940
is a man called great for what
he is, or for what he does?

800
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,777
I mean, uh, taking
Arthur, for instance...

801
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,779
you mean take your uncle, don't you?

802
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,992
Your uncle is great, both in
what he is and what he does.

803
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,482
How could he have
done what he has done

804
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,204
without being what he is?

805
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,414
You mean winning battles?

806
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,041
I mean far more than winning battles.

807
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,877
Every schoolboy knows exactly

808
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,045
how the Nile and Copenhagen were won.

809
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,923
But does every schoolboy
know what they were won with?

810
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,050
Surely we have better
ships than the French.

811
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,886
No sir, certainly not,

812
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,388
but they are better handled.

813
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,640
Yet what kind of men
are they handled by?

814
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,604
Four-fifths of them have
been pressed, kidnapped,

815
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,770
knocked on the head, and
thrown aboard a manor wall

816
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,816
to face a brutal and
degrading slavery,

817
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,526
which they must submit to

818
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,070
or bear their backs to
the cat of nine tails.

819
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,364
But at the Nile, the
seamen drank to Nelson.

820
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,326
Yes sir, to Nelson.

821
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,911
And that is my point.

822
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,205
I see.

823
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,373
He's made these
mutinous dogs love him.

824
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,418
They beg to serve in
any squadron he commands

825
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,837
and cry like women when
they hear he's wounded.

826
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,256
Could he have done that

827
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,091
if he hadn't been great in what he is,

828
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,635
as well as in what he's done?

829
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,679
It's so difficult.

830
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,600
Perhaps I expect a perfect
hero to be a perfect Saint.

831
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,560
Perhaps we all do.

832
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,147
Well, England has no need of a Saint

833
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,274
at this hour of her
history, master Matcham.

834
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,526
But she has very dire need of a hero.

835
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,280
Your health, sir.

836
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,876
You're not ready yet, my love?

837
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,336
Very nearly, my dearest.

838
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,803
You know I always want
to look my best for you,

839
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,299
and that takes time.

840
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,177
The carriage is at the door?

841
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,291
Are the servants in the hall?

842
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,471
Si.

843
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,914
Then tell them to open the
doors as a signal to the crowd.

844
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,492
You leave Cleopatra no shades.

845
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,081
Emma.

846
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,457
Oh, no more of that.

847
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,959
I'm too arranged.

848
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,547
They must be coming down.

849
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,603
Ah, captain Hardy,

850
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,023
what honour you do to my house.

851
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,443
It is I who have that
honour, lady Hamilton.

852
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,404
You see how popular you have become?

853
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,887
I am hardly known to them, my lady.

854
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,032
No, but you should be,

855
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,575
and no doubt one day will be.

856
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,244
All about my Nelson will be known.

857
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,164
Now, you and little George
will go in the second carriage,

858
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,333
lord Nelson and I
naturally in the first.

859
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,084
Pray leave a little
distance between us.

860
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,836
The crowd prefer it so.

861
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,340
Um, may I go and watch, aunt Emma?

862
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,008
Yes, of course, little George.

863
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,031
Don't she look a sight
for a widow in mourning?

864
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,992
Go find her, good doggy.

865
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,118
Follow your mistress.

866
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,830
Hooray for Nelson! Hurrah!

867
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,352
They laughed.

868
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,269
Did they?

869
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,854
Yeah, they laughed.

870
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,232
You must have heard,
they laughed at Nelson.

871
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,025
With lady Hamilton.

872
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,366
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

873
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,785
I'm happy to tell you that
her ladyship has consented

874
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,484
to give us one of her
little entertainments,

875
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,247
tonight after dinner.

876
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,081
Ah.

877
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,459
Oh, one of your
attitudes, dearest Emma?

878
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,545
Cleopatra mourning Antony.

879
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,464
Dear brother Nelson
has written some words

880
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,828
to go with Shakespeare's version.

881
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,217
I have composed the music myself.

882
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,676
It's all quite new.

883
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,636
So as you can well imagine,

884
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,763
I'll be as nervous as a pregnant nun.

885
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,724
So perhaps if you'd all be good enough

886
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,351
to muster in the drawing room

887
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,977
at about seven for dinner.

888
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:22,811
Muster?

889
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,855
You make it sound
like a bloody warship.

890
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,281
Oh, it is so good to be
here at paradise Merton.

891
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,660
Our home for eternity, aye, Nelson?

892
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,704
I was thinking of something
a little longer than eternity.

893
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,224
Oh, you should have seen it last year

894
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,600
and the year before.

895
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,936
Why did I have to fall
in love with a sailor?

896
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,691
Well, at least not one
with a wife in every port.

897
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,041
Wait, together.

898
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,126
Heave.

899
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,827
Well, really,

900
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,080
the world's greatest
sailor, and what do you do?

901
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,454
Well, I could hardly
have wished for myself

902
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,009
how happy I should be.

903
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:21,764
Still, exactly which is
starboard and which is larboard?

904
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,850
Well, that depends on which
way the captain is facing.

905
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,934
Oh, you.

906
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,898
What hour exactly did
you order us to muster?

907
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,650
Seven.

908
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:39,073
Emma, if you could perhaps
tonight be closer to the time,

909
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,741
the last two hours.

910
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,132
I'm glad that he's well.

911
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,592
Thank you, my lord.

912
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,605
Francesca!

913
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,500
Good evening.

914
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,252
Ah, Minto.

915
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,377
Oh, I don't believe you've
met captain Blackwood.

916
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,715
Captain Blackwood is the
captain of the frigate Euryalus,

917
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,676
which sails tomorrow to
join Collingwood off Cadiz.

918
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,636
I wish you a fair wind, captain.

919
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,805
I suppose they'll make
Collingwood an Earl

920
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,181
after he fights your battle.

921
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,099
Will you grudge him it?

922
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,226
Can make him ass licker
and ordinary to the king,

923
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,811
saving your cloth, reverend,

924
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,897
so long as I could keep
my Nelson here with me.

925
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,691
Which I intend to do,

926
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:59,528
despite the underhand work
of some who call him friend.

927
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,407
I am so looking
forward, lady Hamilton,

928
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,369
to seeing your C... C... Cleopatra.

929
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,496
It is my favourite part.

930
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,248
But of course.

931
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,292
Emma Hamilton would
have as her favourite

932
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,626
that lass unparallelled.

933
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,295
Thank you, Minto.

934
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,506
I will accept
unparallelled at any hour,

935
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,342
and after seven I'll even accept lass.

936
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,389
Here's to my Antony.

937
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,975
His legs bestride oceans,

938
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,312
in whose livery wore
crowns and crownets.

939
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,635
In that piece of Shakespeare,

940
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,847
I think that her ladyship of
Egypt exaggerated somewhat.

941
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,737
This ladyship of England
exaggerates nothing.

942
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:45,073
When she looks upon her
great pillar of the world,

943
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,452
she sees great Jove himself.

944
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,953
Hey, little George.

945
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,798
It's a wonder she can
see anything at all.

946
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,708
I heard that, captain Hardy.

947
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,671
This is my house.

948
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,132
And if I choose to toast the guest

949
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,092
who brings such honour to its roof

950
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,762
in what, to your puritan mind,

951
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,389
may seem a glass too many of Brandy,

952
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:13,060
I think that is my affair,
not yours, don't you?

953
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,020
I do, my lady, indeed.

954
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,730
It was only that my puritan mind

955
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,220
hadn't perhaps quite grasped the fact

956
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,638
that this was your ladyship's house.

957
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,401
Merton is our house, Hardy,

958
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,738
your house, and
everybody who visits it.

959
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,198
And it's certainly Emma's.

960
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,284
Most of all, it is Emma's.

961
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,994
Then if it is my house,

962
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,622
tell that bugger to get out
of it and never come back.

963
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,623
Captain Hardy only meant...

964
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,877
I know what captain Hardy
meant, and so does he.

965
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,297
He meant that I am not your
wife by virtue of mother church.

966
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,883
Well, a pox on mother church.

967
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:49,221
I am by everything that this
world holds just and honourable

968
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,224
the true and only
wife of this man here.

969
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,058
Emma, please stop.

970
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,936
To everyone who comes to this house.

971
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,605
To my lord's family, huh?

972
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,443
To my lord's friends,
to my lord's servants.

973
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,530
In fact, to the whole of England,

974
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:13,704
I, Emma Hamilton, am the
only wife of lord Nelson.

975
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,248
Excepting, I would
suppose, to lady Nelson.

976
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,875
Hardy, that was unforgivable.

977
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:20,919
I shall leave.

978
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,421
No.

979
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,548
Hardy, you will not
leave, I command it.

980
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,555
Tell him to get out of this
house now and never come back,

981
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,015
I command you.

982
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,226
You command me in most
things, Emma, but not in that.

983
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,398
Oh, indeed.

984
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,987
Then perhaps, it is I

985
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,865
who should leave
your lordship's house.

986
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,910
Francesca, send for
my carriage at once.

987
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,507
Dinner is served, my lady.

988
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,387
Emma, will you lead us in?

989
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,474
May I have the honour, my dear?

990
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,980
I'd like you to sit here.

991
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,984
Oh, sit where you'd like.

992
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,819
Sit where you'd like.

993
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,755
Hardy, another two ships there.

994
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,095
Right here, gentlemen,

995
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:56,848
is your battle of annihilation,
our two squadrons.

996
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:02,437
Isolate here and here, and destroy.

997
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,650
That's the suggested plan
of battle, Blackwood,

998
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,901
that your frigate will carry

999
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,653
tomorrow to admiral Collingwood.

1000
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,989
I'm indeed most... yes, yes.

1001
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,742
Nothing less than total destruction.

1002
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,426
We must have those
Frenchies in the lines

1003
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,620
stranded there forever,

1004
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,165
and Bonaparte staring
at the Dover cliffs

1005
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,460
in a high old imperial rage.

1006
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,296
Bravo, great Nelson.

1007
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,800
The immortal himself has spoke.

1008
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,178
The immortal has spoke
only ordinary common sense.

1009
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,890
You just sunk half the French fleet.

1010
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:39,975
Poor ole buggers.

1011
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,811
Hardy, what do you think of that?

1012
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,355
It's far too risky.

1013
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,387
Risky's the essence of
every battle I've ever fought.

1014
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,191
Of course it is.

1015
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,028
Risk is the essence of all
great battles won by my Nelson.

1016
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,571
This victory, if it is won,

1017
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,781
will not be won by
your Nelson, my lady.

1018
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,242
I am not talking to
you, captain Hardy.

1019
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,952
Have you forgot?

1020
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,829
I beg your ladyship's pardon.

1021
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,914
I had thought that a
kind of peace between us

1022
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:04,666
had been concluded
at the first course.

1023
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,126
Never.

1024
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,545
A truce perhaps, but no more.

1025
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,673
Well, if you are going
to discuss naval tactics

1026
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:12,507
and such like things,

1027
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,552
I shall find myself more
congenial company up there.

1028
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,795
What are you standing up for?

1029
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,794
So you think it's too
risky for Collingwood?

1030
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,893
Too risky for any admiral
in the world, except one.

1031
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,063
Does your lordship know
of any naval commander

1032
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,666
who would risk losing his entire fleet

1033
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,274
in a single afternoon?

1034
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,957
By following a
revolutionary battle plan,

1035
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,027
conceived by a genius

1036
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:36,364
who has been induced to absent
himself from the action?

1037
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:41,369
You mean seduced,
don't you, captain Hardy?

1038
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,330
Well, I don't give a eunuch's ball,

1039
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,790
saving your cloth, reverend,

1040
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:48,502
for what you and your fine
naval friends think of me.

1041
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,588
I know you would all like
to see me roasting in hell,

1042
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,798
every single one of you.

1043
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,424
Not you, dear, I like you.

1044
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,301
But let me tell you this.

1045
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,013
Nelson's vow to me is
unbreakable, isn't it?

1046
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:00,889
Yes, it is.

1047
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,100
Hardy was not trying
to make me break it.

1048
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,936
He was merely talking
about naval matters.

1049
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,687
Hardy, you haven't drank your port.

1050
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,023
I was waiting, my lord,
for the loyal toast.

1051
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,025
Loyal what?

1052
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,279
Emma?

1053
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,492
Ladies and gentlemen.

1054
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,998
I don't drink to the court
that insults you and me,

1055
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,834
you know that, Nelson.

1056
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,961
Seems that her ladyship

1057
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,921
is going to conform
to the naval custom

1058
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,756
of drinking her toast sitting down.

1059
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,675
The king.

1060
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,759
The king.

1061
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,970
God bless him.

1062
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,556
Don't give a fig for that
old lunatic at Windsor,

1063
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,600
or his German bitch of a queen.

1064
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,269
Here, little George, catch.

1065
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,860
A shade too much
Brandy for good bowling,

1066
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,571
but I make a very handsome cricketer,

1067
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,948
aye, little George?

1068
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,908
Emma, you will apologise

1069
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,577
to captain Hardy and captain Blackwood

1070
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,912
for what you just said about
the king and the queen.

1071
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,290
Because they have
sworn a vow of loyalty

1072
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,499
to his old lunacy?

1073
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:10,500
Yes.

1074
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:14,379
And vows of loyalty are such
sacred things, are they not?

1075
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,380
Yes.

1076
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,008
More sacred, I don't doubt,

1077
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,720
than vows made to
certain persons in bed.

1078
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,973
Perhaps you would be happier
in tomtit's bed than mine.

1079
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,560
Emma, you're making
a spectacle of yourself

1080
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,561
in front of strangers.

1081
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,259
There's nothing in the
world I hate more than that.

1082
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,355
Bugger off.

1083
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,986
Apologise to captain Hardy
and to captain Blackwood.

1084
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,824
All right, then.

1085
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,287
Captain Blackwood,

1086
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,497
captain Hardy,

1087
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:51,583
I apologise.

1088
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,839
You really are the
most enchanting creature.

1089
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,303
Oh, you say the prettiest
things to me sometimes.

1090
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,223
Did you say such things to tomtit?

1091
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,851
You know the answer.

1092
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,353
Yes, I do.

1093
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,273
But I like to hear it said, so say it.

1094
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,526
Very well.

1095
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,489
I dislike my wife and I always have.

1096
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,285
I'm sorry, Blackwood,

1097
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,663
but sometimes the
truth must be spoken.

1098
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,249
She's a cruel, vindictive shrew,

1099
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,793
obsessed with hatred of my Nelson.

1100
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,920
Nelson, tell them about that letter

1101
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,089
you had sent back to her marked,

1102
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,716
"opened in error, but not read."

1103
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,429
Very well, then.

1104
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,514
If you won't, I will.

1105
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,142
Can you imagine what kind of
a letter it must have been

1106
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,728
to have made my gentle-hearted Nelson

1107
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,356
send it back to its writer marked so?

1108
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,340
Did you read this letter, my lady?

1109
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,609
No.

1110
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,027
So dreadful was it,

1111
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,281
my Nelson would not even
give it to me to read.

1112
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:09,619
And to think, that letter
was sent dated Christmas day.

1113
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,454
No.

1114
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,040
December the 18th.

1115
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,086
What did he say?

1116
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,547
He said it was dated
December the 18th.

1117
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,844
Yes.

1118
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,762
Have you read this filthy letter?

1119
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,348
Yes.

1120
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,392
And it wasn't filthy.

1121
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,604
Not the letter I read, anyway.

1122
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,856
How could...

1123
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,944
Have you been seeing tomtit?

1124
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,114
I saw her once.

1125
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,784
George, are you a traitor?

1126
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:55,999
A traitor in our family,
here at paradise Merton?

1127
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,376
Come here, boy.

1128
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,387
Why did you go and see her?

1129
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,433
Because she asked me.

1130
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,561
And she showed you that letter?

1131
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,982
She let me see the envelope
and what was marked on it.

1132
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,654
She didn't want me to read
the letter itself, but I did.

1133
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,603
Because I said you couldn't
possibly have known

1134
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,784
what was written on the envelope.

1135
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,786
And why did you say that?

1136
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,246
Because I thought that no man

1137
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,041
could do such a cruel,
dishonourable thing to his wife,

1138
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,461
least of all you.

1139
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,428
So, as I thought your
honour was involved...

1140
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,846
Jesus.

1141
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,641
Go on.

1142
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,060
I've read the letter,

1143
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,093
and I hoped to read the sort of letter

1144
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,023
that lady Hamilton has just spoken on.

1145
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,695
It wasn't like that at all.

1146
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,115
It was a kind letter.

1147
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,410
I don't remember all the words,

1148
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,330
but there was something

1149
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,707
about finding you a
comfortable, warm house.

1150
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:20,792
Go to your room.

1151
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,504
Uncle, uncle.

1152
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,618
Please tell me that was not the letter

1153
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,702
you sent back to your wife.

1154
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,632
Go to your room at once.

1155
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,831
Catty, take him to his room
and see that he's locked in.

1156
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:30,844
Yes, Horatio.

1157
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,601
Not to his room, out
of this house tonight.

1158
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,354
Send him back to his friend,
the bitch woman of bath.

1159
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,885
I still give the orders in this house,

1160
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,066
and I expect them to be obeyed.

1161
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,235
Take him to his room and lock him in.

1162
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,570
Yes, Horatio.

1163
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,867
The rest of you,
please go to your beds.

1164
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,874
You're not going out
in this, it's pouring.

1165
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,334
By your leave, my lady.

1166
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,878
My lady?

1167
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,838
Are we back to that?

1168
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,549
Nelson, come back.

1169
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,842
Come here, come away.

1170
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,926
Nelson!

1171
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,638
Oh, Minto, what am I to do?

1172
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,890
Do what he says.

1173
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,393
Leave him to cool
his temper in the rain.

1174
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,937
And then when he comes
back from his drenching,

1175
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,648
just apply the right arts.

1176
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,405
The right arts?

1177
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,783
When those arts fail,
the world will end.

1178
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,203
True.

1179
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,289
So they mustn't fail, must they?

1180
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,540
They won't.

1181
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:46,294
Minto, you knew me
when I first met him.

1182
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,297
Was I quite such a
vulgar, drunken slut?

1183
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,551
Oh, you won't answer that.

1184
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:58,640
Yes, your ladyship was always vulgar.

1185
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,725
Well, being a blacksmith's
daughter shows.

1186
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,519
Woman, you're talking nonsense.

1187
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,120
You think I couldn't
have turned myself

1188
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,981
into a genteel English lady?

1189
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,108
My god, who wants to
be like Catty Matcham?

1190
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,610
What a death in life.

1191
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,571
Nope, vulgar I always was,

1192
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,074
vulgar I will remain by choice.

1193
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,703
And now, we come to drunken.

1194
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,541
How does that compare
with six years ago?

1195
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:29,003
I think you drink more
now and get less drunk.

1196
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,215
You don't miss much.

1197
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,969
I drink from morning to night,

1198
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,430
no longer for my enjoyment or
anyone else's, it would seem.

1199
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,308
It's from fear.

1200
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,352
Isn't that why most people drink?

1201
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,937
Fear of losing him?

1202
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,063
Of course.

1203
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,315
But my dear lady,
that will never happen.

1204
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,235
You really believe that?

1205
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,572
You think I still look
well enough, do I?

1206
01:07:55,655 --> 01:08:00,159
You look as desirable as
when you sat for Romney.

1207
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,791
Oh, don't say that, my god.

1208
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,669
I can eat flattery, but
when you mention Romney,

1209
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,004
I know you're lying.

1210
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,339
I did not say beautiful,
I said desirable.

1211
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,050
By candlelight, to a man half-blind.

1212
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,596
By candlelight or daylight,

1213
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,473
half-blind or with both eyes clear,

1214
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,351
Nelson will always see
you as Romney saw you,

1215
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,687
as his divine lady.

1216
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,981
And how do I see myself?

1217
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,065
Answer me that.

1218
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,319
I look at myself in the
morning and I think,

1219
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,571
"he can't love that."

1220
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:37,822
Not that.

1221
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,163
And I do love him.

1222
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,247
I think you do.

1223
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,041
Only think?

1224
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:52,462
My god, I love him
more than I love life.

1225
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,597
Oh, Minto, you go to him.

1226
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,557
Oh, please.

1227
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,351
He's thinking of her and that's bad.

1228
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,061
It's always bad.

1229
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,270
You go to him.

1230
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,651
As your ladyship commands.

1231
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,568
Have you come to
plague me with questions?

1232
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,592
No.

1233
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,470
Did you know of that letter?

1234
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,055
No.

1235
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,516
I wonder how many people he's told.

1236
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,809
Does it matter?

1237
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:53,981
May we please take some
shelter from the rain?

1238
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:57,151
I'm not so used to huger
storms on the bay of Biscay.

1239
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,742
Does it matter, you ask?

1240
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:06,953
Possibly not.

1241
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,747
The world must be on her side.

1242
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,375
A faithful and loving wife,

1243
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,878
vilely cheated by her husband,

1244
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,589
now living in loneliness and despair

1245
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:21,259
because that very villain
who cast her off so cruelly

1246
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,178
has bribed his family and
intimidated his friends

1247
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,638
to make them desert her, too.

1248
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:30,518
A pitiful, misused lady,

1249
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,646
flying her flag with genteel dignity

1250
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,814
in her lodgings in bath,

1251
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,024
while her besotted husband

1252
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,695
rollicks away his honour
and his reputation

1253
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,406
with the mother of his bastard child.

1254
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,950
That's how the boy sees it, Minto.

1255
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,870
Why should not the world see
it through his eyes, too?

1256
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,247
The world, Horatio,
is not your nephew.

1257
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,418
I'm not at all sure that
my nephew is not the world.

1258
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,921
Young eyes usually
see the truth of things

1259
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,465
through a distorting mirror,

1260
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,912
but oh, so does the world, I suppose.

1261
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,384
I know what the world sees.

1262
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:05,970
Six years ago in Naples,

1263
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,805
I deserted a loyal and loving wife

1264
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,683
for the embraces of
a notorious charmer.

1265
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,519
"He's not leaving his wife
for that woman," you said.

1266
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,773
That Emma Hamilton, who
displayed herself naked

1267
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,232
at 14 Vauxhall gardens.

1268
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,694
Was sold by Greville to
Hamilton to repay a bad debt,

1269
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,739
and was vetted by half the
nobility and gentry in England?

1270
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,867
Do you think I didn't know
how loud the laughter was?

1271
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,953
Did they laugh in the
house of lords, Minto?

1272
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,039
My lordship, they laugh easily.

1273
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,124
And if I'm to be strangled for it,

1274
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,293
I'd prefer a bit more
shelter than this.

1275
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,934
Her ladyship's private signal.

1276
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,064
Not yet.

1277
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,693
You think I don't see
exactly what you see?

1278
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,781
A vulgar, drunken
woman throwing a fit?

1279
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,868
You think I don't
wince at the stories,

1280
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,703
shudder at the language,

1281
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,707
wretch at the smell
of Brandy sometimes?

1282
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,295
Do you think I'm so
stupid and insensitive

1283
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,840
that I don't suffer a
thousand deaths every day

1284
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,508
when I'm with Emma?

1285
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,638
Forgive me, I must walk.

1286
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,560
Go in if you want to.

1287
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,240
I was jeered at in
clergy street today.

1288
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,868
I think I can understand why.

1289
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,327
No, you don't.

1290
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,623
All you understand is
the tragedy of a love,

1291
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,625
unsuitable to a national hero.

1292
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,670
A man who wins your victories for you.

1293
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:06,424
But there's no tragedy,
Minto, I promise you.

1294
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,094
I'm still content
with my lot and that.

1295
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,765
You can call it an
obsession if you'd like,

1296
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,434
but I love her.

1297
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,688
And I want exactly who she is.

1298
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,985
Goodnight, Minto,

1299
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:27,904
dear friend.

1300
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,261
I was commanded to whip my son.

1301
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:59,310
If I'm too cowardly,
I must command you to do it.

1302
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,520
If it is not done, she will know.

1303
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,815
But you must not
hope to see her tonight.

1304
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,992
The key to his room.

1305
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,831
All right, Matcham.

1306
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,333
You go to bed.

1307
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,989
Well, am I to be the first to talk?

1308
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,033
I have nothing to say.

1309
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,077
How was lady Nelson?

1310
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:43,914
Unhappy?

1311
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,295
I'm sorry you should've seen it.

1312
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,965
Did she talk much about me?

1313
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,593
With love, I suppose.

1314
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,722
With noble, resigned, forgiving love.

1315
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,268
What did she say?

1316
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,650
She said you were the
kindest, gentlest soul alive.

1317
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,361
How easy it is for her
to find the right words.

1318
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,447
And she doesn't mean them?

1319
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,895
Oh yes, of course she means them.

1320
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,533
She has no reason to invent them.

1321
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,662
And she can write them,
too, as well as speak them.

1322
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,332
For instance, George,

1323
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,087
bath, the 18th of December, 1801.

1324
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,128
"My clearest husband."

1325
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,423
It is some time since
I've written to you.

1326
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,050
The silence which you have imposed

1327
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,594
is more than my affection will allow.

1328
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,428
In this instance,

1329
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,348
I hope you will forgive
me for not obeying you.

1330
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,476
One thing that I omitted
from my letter of July,

1331
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,715
that I have now to offer you,

1332
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,396
if your accommodation is
a comfortable, warm house.

1333
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,399
Do, my dear husband,
let us live together.

1334
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:55,361
I can never be happy until
this event takes place.

1335
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:59,532
Let everything be buried in oblivion.

1336
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,700
It will pass away like a dream.

1337
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:05,996
"I am, most sincerely and
affectionately, your wife."

1338
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,794
You see, George, I did read it.

1339
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:14,880
Yes.

1340
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,539
Aunt Frances must have done something

1341
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,927
really dreadful to you once.

1342
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,264
What?

1343
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,267
She wrote that letter.

1344
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,437
Perhaps you'll
understand better one day.

1345
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,482
No, I'll never understand it.

1346
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:34,775
Never!

1347
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,570
It was a kind, loving letter.

1348
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,908
Many cruel acts are done
out of love and kindness.

1349
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,161
Perhaps most, George.

1350
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:49,582
Oh, dear god.

1351
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,960
Must I explain?

1352
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,545
Yes, you must.

1353
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,256
Is it so important to you?

1354
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,925
The most important thing on earth.

1355
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,887
Very well, I'll try.

1356
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,849
But it won't save my honour
that you guard so carefully.

1357
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,475
Oh, don't make fun of that.

1358
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:09,560
I won't.

1359
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:15,191
George, when you have
done wrong to someone,

1360
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,195
an open wrong, a shameful wrong,

1361
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,780
to be forgiven for
it is the very hell.

1362
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,661
What do you do about an
enemy who won't hate you?

1363
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,956
That answers every broadside

1364
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,085
with a signal gently fluttering
from the mast that says,

1365
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,922
"whatever you do to me, I
shall always forgive you,

1366
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,549
and I will go on
loving you forever?"

1367
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,599
And that's the truth, George.

1368
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,106
But why must she be an enemy?

1369
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,858
Because she declared war.

1370
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,903
How?

1371
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,154
She made me choose.

1372
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,783
But that's not war.

1373
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,869
It was to me.

1374
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:14,250
Anyway, don't think I resent
your alliance with her.

1375
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,501
There's no alliance.

1376
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,170
I must take your side.

1377
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,713
Why?

1378
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:22,007
Now you know what
a shameful fellow I am.

1379
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,180
Because you're Nelson.

1380
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,978
Well, here's your first lesson

1381
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,563
in a long and difficult course.

1382
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,775
Human love and human hate.

1383
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,028
It's a complex study for anyone,

1384
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,822
and I never went to school,

1385
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,824
but did you understand any of it?

1386
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,243
No.

1387
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:51,526
Well, you're in good company.

1388
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,749
Now, if you'll oblige me
with the use of your pillow.

1389
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,841
Could I ask you for
a little cooperation?

1390
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,759
A yelp or two might be of service.

1391
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,306
Well, very well.

1392
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:13,559
Now let this be a lesson to you, sir,

1393
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,144
that you'll never forget.

1394
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,981
I'll have no more
treachery under this roof.

1395
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,483
You have both insulted me

1396
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:26,405
and gravely offended lady Hamilton.

1397
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,333
Goodnight, George.

1398
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,715
Goodnight, uncle.

1399
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,884
Perhaps one day we'll both understand.

1400
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,187
You didn't hurt him too much, did you?

1401
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,564
I don't know, but I
have certainly hurt him.

1402
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:02,691
And yourself, too.

1403
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,449
Oh my Nelson, I do
shame you sometimes.

1404
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:15,746
The culprit most humbly
begs your forgiveness.

1405
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,586
Emma, there's no one here.

1406
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,508
Your Emma has most
grievously offended,

1407
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,593
and does most humbly submit herself

1408
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,428
to your lordship's great will.

1409
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,015
You know my will.

1410
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,060
Whether it's great or
not is another matter,

1411
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,728
but it's certainly unquenchable.

1412
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,193
I was very bad, wasn't I?

1413
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,277
It's forgotten.

1414
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,340
Did I really call Hardy a bugger?

1415
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:51,365
You did.

1416
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,658
Let's hope inaccurately.

1417
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,997
Oh, I will behave better, I promise.

1418
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,374
I will, I will.

1419
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,503
My heaven, you're soaking.

1420
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,505
A glass of Brandy.

1421
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,550
Emma's sovereign cure for all ills.

1422
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,053
Oh, Nelson.

1423
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,473
I was so afraid tonight
that I would lose you.

1424
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,517
Never.

1425
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,353
Not 'til death.

1426
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,442
Who shall we drink to?

1427
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,734
Let's drink.

1428
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,409
To Emma and her Nelson.

1429
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,272
Ooh, you've spoiled your pretty plan.

1430
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,356
Yes.

1431
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:08,525
What a shame.

1432
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,529
I had intended keeping the
table laid exactly like this

1433
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:16,366
to show visitors how Nelson
won his battle of Cadiz.

1434
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:21,038
You mean how Collingwood
won Nelson's battle of Cadiz?

1435
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:27,503
I said how Nelson won it.

1436
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,428
Emma, I did not ask...

1437
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,889
no, but you were going to.

1438
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:39,723
No, you're wrong.

1439
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,183
I would never, never have asked.

1440
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:46,688
Well, you'd have called me
my lady a little more often,

1441
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:48,315
or perhaps discovered

1442
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,430
you wanted to walk out of
the house alone in the rain

1443
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,361
as the time of the battle drew nearer.

1444
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:58,283
I love my Nelson,
but I love all of him.

1445
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,117
I don't want half of him,

1446
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,787
with the better half
pining to be out at sea.

1447
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:05,249
Has Hardy been talking to you tonight?

1448
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,585
That person, I would not soil my lips.

1449
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,338
Emma?

1450
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,009
And it's not only
that feeling, Nelson.

1451
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,414
I wouldn't want to be thought of

1452
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,430
as the woman who
kept you from going out

1453
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:21,974
when your country needed you.

1454
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,726
It is my country, too, you know.

1455
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,397
So you, too, think I'm needed?

1456
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,735
There is only one
Nelson in the whole world,

1457
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,241
and he is mine and mine alone.

1458
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,829
Yes, yours alone.

1459
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:48,417
Mine to keep and mine to give.

1460
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:54,463
Promise me one thing.

1461
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,550
This time, take care.

1462
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,720
Don't leave your Emma
alone and deserted.

1463
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,931
I'll do everything in my power

1464
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,475
to see that you are
not alone and deserted.

1465
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:10,897
And this I solemnly vow, before god.

1466
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,320
Well, you're very good with vows,

1467
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:18,113
and you do your best to keep them.

1468
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,995
Where will the victory be?

1469
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,080
Here, I suppose.

1470
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,625
I think it's better to
leave the disposition to me.

1471
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,780
Otherwise, you'll
have sunk half the fleet

1472
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,378
before I've had time
to engage the enemy.

1473
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:38,592
It will be another victory, won't it?

1474
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,177
Yes.

1475
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,595
A big one?

1476
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:42,846
A very big one.

1477
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:21,763
When they see our masts
coming over the horizon,

1478
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,721
they'll see what think
is our line of sail.

1479
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,349
I'll hoist no signal
that betrays them.

1480
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,393
It's also our line of battle,

1481
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,436
except one.

1482
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,022
A little signal to amuse the fleet.

1483
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,003
You'll excuse us, gentlemen,

1484
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,530
but the order's been sounded
to prepare ship for action.

1485
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,200
Well, gentlemen, I think that's all.

1486
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:46,827
You better rejoin your ships.

1487
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,453
There is one question, my lord.

1488
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:49,697
At our conference last night,

1489
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:50,914
you agreed, did you not,

1490
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:53,458
that the victory should not
be the first into battle?

1491
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,419
Villeneuve flies his
flag on the Bucentaure.

1492
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,671
According to the rules of the search,

1493
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,631
he's my prize, nobody else's.

1494
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,925
I take it we're all agreed on that?

1495
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,178
The enemy is sighted, my lord.

1496
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,639
Good gentlemen, to business.

1497
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,349
May god bless our endeavours.

1498
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:14,521
Captain?

1499
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,689
Yes, my lord.

1500
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,108
For five hours, I've
watched you trying to pass me

1501
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,026
in your damn temeraire.

1502
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:20,861
When we come to battle,

1503
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,559
I'll thank you to keep
to your proper state.

1504
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,156
Yes, my lord, what is that?

1505
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,240
Behind me.

1506
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,249
Fresh beef after battle, eh?

1507
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,425
Heave, heave!

1508
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:17,094
England expects that
every man will do his duty.

1509
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,866
_ my great god whom I worship,

1510
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,828
Grant my country and for the
benefit of Europe in general

1511
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,830
a great and glorious victory.

1512
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,167
May no misconduct
in anyone tarnish it.

1513
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:45,130
May humanity after victory

1514
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,632
be the predominant feature
of the British fleet.

1515
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,343
For myself individually,

1516
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,512
I commit my life to him who made me,

1517
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,764
and may his blessing
lie on my endeavours

1518
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,474
to serve my country faithfully.

1519
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:01,980
To him, I resign myself
and the just cause,

1520
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:05,442
which has been
entrusted to me to defend.

1521
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:11,615
Amen, amen, amen.

1522
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:15,785
Blackwood, why aren't
you aboard your ship?

1523
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,913
I stayed, my lord, in
case you should, after all,

1524
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,081
decide to fly your flag in a frigate.

1525
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,417
I beg my pardon, my lord?

1526
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,462
The frigate was for Collingwood.

1527
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,882
You better get on board
yours and carry over.

1528
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:30,592
My lord, will you please reconsider?

1529
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,594
The victory, if she
is first into battle,

1530
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,626
will have the weight of four
enemy battleships against her,

1531
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,598
alone and unsupported.

1532
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,225
You make it four
to you, I make it five.

1533
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,021
Will you at least keep
your personal promise to me

1534
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,272
and wear a plain coat?

1535
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,983
I see you presume to send for it.

1536
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,236
May I assist your lordship into it?

1537
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,071
Don't you trust me, Hardy?

1538
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,405
No, my lord.

1539
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:55,241
Well, since you and Blackwood
are so conveniently here,

1540
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:58,078
I'd like you to attest to my
signature on this document.

1541
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,829
There's no necessity
for you to read it,

1542
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,123
but in case we are burnt or sunk,

1543
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,626
I better give you the gist of it.

1544
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:07,754
Now this document clearly
leaves lady Hamilton,

1545
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,966
I'll read you the last paragraph.

1546
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,676
"I leave Emma lady Hamilton,

1547
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,844
therefore a legacy to
my king and country,

1548
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,097
that they will give
her an ample provision

1549
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,099
to maintain her rank in life."

1550
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,686
Now, if you'd sign it just here.

1551
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:49,838
Thank you, gentlemen.

1552
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:50,922
All right.

1553
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:54,759
Goodbye, Blackwood.

1554
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:55,844
Goodbye, my lord.

1555
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,471
And may I wish your
lordship a most complete

1556
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,390
and crushing victory ever won.

1557
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:04,394
Well, if it's to be, it'll
be no more than I've planned.

1558
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,189
But god will decide all.

1559
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,900
Thank you, gentlemen.

1560
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,217
Stockings and shoes for
the battle. Mr. Pavel.

1561
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:00,677
Easier for the surgeons.

1562
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:17,735
Yes.

1563
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,988
Do you see how careless I've become?

1564
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,115
I'll send a midshipman to your cabin.

1565
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,785
I think the time has
passed for changing clothes.

1566
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,501
It's bad gunnery.

1567
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,254
They'll be firing at each other next.

1568
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,102
It'll be some time
before we can open fire,

1569
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,926
so shall we continue our walk?

1570
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:25,136
When we come to it, louder
than the guns, Mr. McKillop.

1571
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,460
I beg your lordship's pardon?

1572
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:27,796
I said, "when we come to it",

1573
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:31,184
louder than the
guns, Mr. McKillop.

1574
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,714
Prepare all decks for close action.

1575
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,251
Report when ready.

1576
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,835
Starboard gun deck, ready.

1577
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:59,545
Middle gun deck, ready.

1578
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,548
Upper gun deck ready, sir.

1579
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:03,925
All guns ready, sir.

1580
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:07,095
Sink me a ship, master gunner.

1581
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,304
Aye-aye, sir.

1582
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,559
Fire!

1583
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,731
Fire!

1584
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,176
- Justin?
- Lord.

1585
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:12,053
Take a party and man the tiller.

1586
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,472
Make a signal to the fleet.

1587
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:16,265
Engage the enemy more closely.

1588
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,351
Aye-aye, my lord.

1589
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,580
Warm work, Hardy.

1590
01:40:57,843 --> 01:41:00,179
They've done for me at last, Hardy.

1591
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,598
No, no.

1592
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:03,683
Yes.

1593
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,519
My backbone is shot through.

1594
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:10,398
Best cover these up.

1595
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:12,984
The man must know

1596
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:17,071
that plain coat

1597
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:19,282
might've been...

1598
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,913
Cover him and take him below.

1599
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:44,974
Back to the guns.

1600
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:46,726
Look lively!

1601
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,481
I'm done for, doctor.

1602
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,317
You may save other lives.

1603
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,447
Just send for captain Hardy.

1604
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,032
He's here, my lord.

1605
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:51,791
Hardy.

1606
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,794
How goes it, Hardy?

1607
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,838
The Bucentaure has surrendered.

1608
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:03,260
We've captured Villeneuve?

1609
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:08,599
Tell Collingwood to treat him well.

1610
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,102
He,

1611
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:17,733
he has been a most gallant enemy.

1612
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:24,448
I would've enjoyed Villeneuve
as my guest at dinner tonight.

1613
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:30,329
What of the other enemy ships?

1614
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,575
I can't tell your lordship

1615
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:34,667
exactly how many prizes we've taken,

1616
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:38,671
but I can answer for 15
of their larger ships.

1617
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:43,050
I'd bargained 20.

1618
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:49,849
No British ship struck or sunk?

1619
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:51,016
No, my lord.

1620
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:52,393
It is the greatest

1621
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:54,729
and most complete
victory ever won at sea.

1622
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,319
That's good, of course,
but I had bargained for 20.

1623
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:07,950
Hardy.

1624
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,079
Thank god I've done my duty,

1625
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:21,088
for which more, much more
than you will ever know,

1626
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,050
you should thank my darling Emma.

1627
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:33,726
It's difficult to see you.

1628
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:39,899
Kiss me.

1629
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:55,956
I've not ever been too great a sinner.

1630
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:01,754
Too great.

1631
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:14,034
I have been entrusted with dispatches,

1632
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:16,745
which I have brought by the
fastest frigate in our fleet.

1633
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:19,039
And so, my lady,

1634
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:21,292
as I have not yet
reported to the admiralty,

1635
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:22,817
you are the first person in England

1636
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:25,421
to hear the news of this
great victory at Trafalgar.

1637
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:28,966
It was what he sought, my lady,

1638
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,760
the utter and complete
annihilation of the enemy fleet.

1639
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,139
His plan worked, as he knew it would.

1640
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:38,893
It worked as well as he
could ever have wished.

1641
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:48,402
Forgive me, my lady,
I have more to tell.

1642
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:49,737
I know you have, captain.

1643
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,032
I know what other news you
are bearing to the admiralty.

1644
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:54,617
How?

1645
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,826
Who has told you?

1646
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,370
No one has told me,
for no one needed to.

1647
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:01,957
I knew when he left I would
not see him again alive.

1648
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:06,086
How else, if you are Nelson,
can you leave this life,

1649
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,505
except at the moment of
your greatest triumph?

1650
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:12,718
Did he suffer much pain?

1651
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:14,845
Some, but not much.

1652
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,014
Of that, I can assure your ladyship.

1653
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:19,892
I was with him at the end.

1654
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:26,148
Did he speak of me?

1655
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:29,151
He spoke of little else.

1656
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:31,111
You're not inventing that to be kind?

1657
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:32,905
No, my lady.

1658
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,365
I would never do that.

1659
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,743
No, you would not.

1660
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,828
Some other messenger
might, but not you.

1661
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:43,445
I must not detain you, captain,

1662
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,876
from taking your great
news to the admiralty.

1663
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,254
It was kind of you to break
your journey at Merton.

1664
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:52,132
Forgive me if I do not
see you to the door.

1665
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:13,487
"To the right
honourable viscountess Nelson."

1666
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:15,823
Madam, it is with utmost concern

1667
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:18,409
that in the midst of
victory at Trafalgar,

1668
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:19,994
I have to inform your ladyship

1669
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:22,663
of the death of your
illustrious partner,

1670
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,540
lord viscount Nelson.

1671
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:27,543
It is the death he wished for

1672
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,170
and the less to be
regretted on that account.

1673
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:33,215
But the public loss is irretrievable.

1674
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,343
I can only add that
events of this kind

1675
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,178
"do not happen by chance."

1676
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:42,433
No, not by chance.

1677
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,644
"I commend, therefore, your ladyship,

1678
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,480
to the protection of almighty god.

1679
01:48:48,564 --> 01:48:49,565
And since..."

1680
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:02,411
Lady Hamilton,
she says she will see you.

1681
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:04,955
But please, oh please, lady Nelson,

1682
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,499
it would be so kind if you go.

1683
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:09,918
For a whole week, she's not well.

1684
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,587
Not see visitors.

1685
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,921
Lady Nelson?

1686
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:15,382
Lady Nelson.

1687
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:18,886
Or is it countess?

1688
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:21,180
I hear they've made him
an Earl after his death.

1689
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:24,892
Anyway, this is indeed
an unexpected pleasure.

1690
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,521
Pray forgive the attire.

1691
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:32,983
It was all I could find in
my wardrobe of mourning.

1692
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:35,277
I never could abide black.

1693
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,155
Lady Hamilton, I have
come for one purpose only,

1694
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,074
to bring you some news

1695
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:44,870
that you may, in your
grief, find of some comfort.

1696
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:46,330
My grief?

1697
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:47,539
What about yours?

1698
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:50,834
It can hardly be as great.

1699
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:51,710
Six years is a long enough time

1700
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:53,504
to grow accustomed to a loss.

1701
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:55,464
You never did lose him.

1702
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:56,965
Never did quite lose him.

1703
01:49:57,049 --> 01:49:58,092
Didn't you know that?

1704
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:04,681
I would ask your ladyship,
your countess-ship.

1705
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:10,938
Oh, and I did so
want to be a countess.

1706
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:13,941
I'm a snob, you see.

1707
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:14,983
I always have been.

1708
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,320
I would invite you
into my drawing room

1709
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:20,781
had the creditors not already
taken out all the furniture,

1710
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,492
but if your ladyship
should require refreshment...

1711
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,119
no, I thank you.

1712
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:28,330
Well, you will forgive this ladyship.

1713
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:36,547
Oh, why don't they
stop ringing that bell?

1714
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:40,384
They've been ringing it day and night.

1715
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:42,344
I suppose they think my Nelson...

1716
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:46,640
Oh, sorry, our Nelson will hear it

1717
01:50:46,765 --> 01:50:49,184
as he rolls about in
that barrel of Brandy

1718
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:51,395
they're bringing him home in.

1719
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:54,982
Brandy, you know, is the best
preservative for the dead.

1720
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:58,902
But is it for the living?

1721
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:05,659
Oh, I applaud your ladyship's
wit, but I am not living.

1722
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:08,787
What is your comforting news?

1723
01:51:08,871 --> 01:51:11,039
My husband's will has arrived.

1724
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,499
Ah.

1725
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:14,126
In it, of course,

1726
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:15,794
you were left this house.

1727
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,296
And contents.

1728
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:18,505
It had better be.

1729
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:19,744
There aren't any left anyway,

1730
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,633
and the house is buried in mortgages.

1731
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:22,801
Yes, that is known.

1732
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:27,556
But this document should repair all,

1733
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:30,475
much more than all.

1734
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:31,768
How can that be?

1735
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:34,188
He had nothing to leave
but his stars and medals.

1736
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:39,651
This codicil, duly signed,
attested, and perfectly legal,

1737
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,779
requests that your king and country

1738
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:44,740
should give you ample provision

1739
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:47,034
to maintain your rank in life,

1740
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:50,579
and leaves you, Emma lady Hamilton,

1741
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:53,040
as a bequest to the nation.

1742
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:10,641
A bequest to the nation?

1743
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,893
Me?

1744
01:52:18,523 --> 01:52:20,317
I'll die on this.

1745
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:24,738
Can you just see me, in
Westminster hall, on a plin?

1746
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,615
Or at Windsor sitting on the throne

1747
01:52:26,907 --> 01:52:27,987
between the king and queen,

1748
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,869
with a plaque saying,
"here sits Emma Hamilton,

1749
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:33,247
the late lord Nelson's whore."

1750
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:41,546
My poor Nelson, what a baby he was.

1751
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:44,716
Did he really think there
would be the slightest chance?

1752
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:46,843
I give you my word

1753
01:52:46,927 --> 01:52:49,805
that I personally will
do everything in my power

1754
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,724
to see that my lord's
last wishes are met.

1755
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:55,394
I believe you will.

1756
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:56,228
I can't think why.

1757
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:58,230
If it were me, I'd have
torn that thing up.

1758
01:52:58,313 --> 01:52:59,940
I don't think so.

1759
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:03,318
Nothing I have heard about
you has indicated anything

1760
01:53:03,402 --> 01:53:05,404
but the most wide and generous nature.

1761
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,115
Wide and generous?

1762
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,450
A whore, that's all.

1763
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:13,328
A whore who stole your husband.

1764
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:18,458
My husband left my bed for yours.

1765
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:21,670
He was bound to leave it
one day for somebody's.

1766
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:23,797
I've understood that
for a long time now.

1767
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:26,091
But why should we quarrel

1768
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:28,510
because the bed happened to be yours?

1769
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:33,247
You must have hated me, didn't you?

1770
01:53:33,265 --> 01:53:35,892
Yes, just as you hated me.

1771
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,521
You're a good woman.

1772
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:42,357
And the good has triumphed at last.

1773
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:46,695
Is there any triumph for either of us?

1774
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,366
What will happen to you?

1775
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:54,995
Well, debtors' prisons

1776
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,247
aren't that uncomfortable these days.

1777
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:58,999
There's always this.

1778
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:00,709
I might even cheat my creditors.

1779
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:02,586
It'd be a race anyway.

1780
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,968
Let me keep this.

1781
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:12,679
Could always sell the signature.

1782
01:54:13,221 --> 01:54:16,141
I wonder, lady Nelson, as
a matter of idle curiosity,

1783
01:54:16,224 --> 01:54:17,797
which of us will be
the better remembered

1784
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,686
100 years from now?

1785
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:21,229
You, I suppose.

1786
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:22,856
I'll just be the figure of fun.

1787
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:27,152
Well, the figure of fun
is going back to her bed.

1788
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:33,492
Oh, why don't they
stop that bloody bell?

1789
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,579
Can I, I help you?

1790
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:39,664
No.

1791
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:42,626
Thank you for coming down.

1792
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:44,211
I mean that.

1793
01:54:47,756 --> 01:54:49,633
Oh, Jesus.

1794
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:58,266
You know, he very nearly
didn't come to Naples at all.

1795
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,395
Then I'd never have met him.

1796
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:05,190
His first orders were for Gibraltar.

1797
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:14,032
It's a funny world, isn't it?

1798
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:52,195
Stand by.
