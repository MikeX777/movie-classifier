Winds blew in February,
March sewed the dress..

11
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:51,791
April prepared itself for tillage
(Folk saying)

12
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,187
Kakhaber!

13
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,077
Come here, boy

14
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,045
They've all dried off, Kakhaber

15
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,263
Can't anything be
done about it?

16
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,076
What is there to be done?

17
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:05,334
Even a tree is mortal
in this world

18
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,913
I'm to blame

19
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:13,421
I didn't tend them
enough, lately

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,795
I had to replant
them last spring, but...

21
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:22,200
I couldn't attend to it all

22
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,469
How's it going, Anthimos?

23
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,207
Can it be saved?

24
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:40,638
You wouldn't wish it
to your worst enemy

25
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,045
It's all dried up

26
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,975
No trace of life

27
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:49,066
Such a cold winter
we had this year

28
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,063
The kind of wind,
that blew in December

29
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:53,544
Would wither any tree

30
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:56,886
Such a winter is unheard of,
in these areas

31
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,556
Everything comes to an end

32
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,751
These trees have lived
for at least 2 centuries

33
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,500
Isn't that so, Luka?

34
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:05,992
Yes

35
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,604
Around so

36
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,206
"Khechachuri" pears lived here
long before that, but they've wilted

37
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,860
But these ones

38
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,202
My grandfather Giorgi planted

39
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:23,551
Before my father was born

40
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,290
Bless his soul

41
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,900
He sure had a
beneficent hand

42
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,517
Here,

43
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:34,070
It's been more than
a hundred years

44
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,269
He's lying in the ground

45
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,826
But these trees kept on living

46
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,484
You won't find
"Khechachuri" any more

47
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:46,508
In these areas,
they've exctinted long ago

48
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,084
Child told me about it

49
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,717
I almost beat him

50
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,399
I thought it was a joke

51
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,960
It had fruits, like honey

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,971
True

53
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:07,546
It's like my grandfather Giorgi
has passed away this right moment

54
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:26,257
Up to now,
I considered him alive

55
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,302
Kakha

56
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,180
Kakha!

57
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,150
Kakha, where are you

58
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:01,604
You, miserable!

59
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,318
What's the matter, woman

60
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:05,603
Let me go

61
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:09,252
What's all the fuss
with this "Khechachuri"

62
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,292
Why do you harp about
these trees all the time

63
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,719
What's on your mind?
Travelling so far away

64
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,032
I'll get the plants and
see a bit fo this world

65
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:22,374
It's been half a century I haven't left this place

66
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,069
Oh My!

67
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:26,906
Such a long distance

68
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,402
Such a big city

69
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,168
So what

70
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,921
It isn't the first time
I'm visiting the city

71
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,272
How would I know?

72
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,239
You haven't been there,
since we're together

73
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,826
So what?

74
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,866
I clearly remember the place

75
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:44,195
The boy will see the world

76
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:45,779
It is time to

77
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:06,976
All right

78
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,173
All right, all right

79
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,939
Oh my!

80
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,502
What is this?

81
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:24,157
Kakha!

82
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,023
Grades

83
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,397
Grades, eh?

84
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,820
English - D

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,936
Here you go

86
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,872
English - D

87
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,712
Wha's this, boy?

88
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,336
Aren't you ashamed?

89
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:03,452
If you think English is so easy to learn, go on and learn it yourself

90
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:07,122
For example, the word "light" is written in the book

91
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:10,543
"light" is written, but you have to read it as 'lait'

92
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,583
Or let's take the word "whisky"

93
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:15,930
You have to
pronounce it as "uiski"

94
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,077
Boy!

95
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:21,482
If it's called "uiski",
why don't they just write "uiski"?!

96
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,337
I won't study this English at all

97
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:24,385
Why should I
make such effort

98
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,229
Let those englishmen learn Georgian, are we any less?

99
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,128
Here you go!

100
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,398
The boy is right

101
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:41,672
We are leaving now

102
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,433
Right!

103
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,332
Let's go

104
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,063
Good bye

105
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,455
Bye!

106
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,654
Good bye Granny

107
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:21,618
Go inside now

108
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:15,296
Why are you howling like that

109
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,635
Hello Grandpa Luka

110
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:22,025
Come down,
I'll give you a lift

111
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:23,386
What is this boy?

112
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,534
Your bulls look shattered

113
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:25,554
Or the carriage

114
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,282
Come now,
don't start it your way

115
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:32,372
Look how you've
dressed yourself up

116
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:35,861
I've never seen you decorated like this before

117
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:38,335
And the boy looks
like a city boy now

118
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,728
Heading to the city?

119
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,699
I am, my friend

120
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,249
You too, grandpa's boy?

121
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,770
Me too

122
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:48,731
Come now

123
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,082
Does anyone go so far away
for just "Khechachuri" pear plants?

124
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,019
We have "Prangula" pear seeds
in our nursery garden

125
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:57,657
It fruits in just two years

126
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:58,770
I know them, those pears

127
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:00,911
They taste like unboiled potatoes

128
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,350
They give you two abazs for kg

129
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,296
And if you aske me..

130
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,215
Nobody's asking you

131
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,089
Grandpa, Grandpa

132
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:20,191
This world bears
so many blockeads

133
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,034
Grandpa Luka

134
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,470
"Khechachuri" fruits only
after 12 years, right?

135
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,881
Right, so what?

136
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:27,579
So what?

137
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,876
Waiting 12 years for
couple of pears?

138
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,285
You are all so impatient

139
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:35,884
Always in a hurry, wanting it
all at this very minute

140
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:40,305
I prefer today's egg,
over tomorrow's hen

141
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,319
It's a silly proverb

142
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,353
Otherwise, we wouldn't have neither egg, nor hen for now

143
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,811
Grandpa Luka
you must be around 70

144
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,262
73

145
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:58,703
The world was falling apart, but the jackal held the wedding
(folk saying)

146
00:11:58,823 --> 00:11:59,461
Kakha!

147
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,021
Come down here

148
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,377
Come now,
what did I say such?

149
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,314
Neither my song,
nor my word pleases you

150
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,173
What a strange man you are

151
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,277
Grandpa, grandpa

152
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:16,708
Kakha

153
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,169
Kakhaber

154
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,101
What is it, grandpa?

155
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,883
We have to buy tickets

156
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,840
The station is this way

157
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,550
Good day

158
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,025
What?

159
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:40,673
I would like a ticket

160
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,249
For Sachkhere train

161
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,395
The train for Sachkhere
has already left

162
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:47,080
Left? where?

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,999
The train left at 11 in the morning

164
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,229
Things are bad

165
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,298
Come back tomorrow

166
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:58,947
Thank you my dear

167
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,749
Thank you

168
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,074
What can we do, let's go

169
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:12,088
Let's see the
sights of the city first

170
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,878
And spend the night
at the hotel, right?

171
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:14,695
Right

172
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,441
Kakhaber

173
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:23,466
See that garrent?

174
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:24,259
Right?

175
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:25,372
Yes

176
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:27,737
Me and my friend
used to live there

177
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:28,869
Arqipo?

178
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:30,986
Yes, Arqipo

179
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:35,570
If you only knew what a boy your grandpa used to be back then

180
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,769
What about Tsitsino?

181
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:47,431
There

182
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:51,438
That pretty Tsitsino used
to live behind that bridge

183
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,362
Her father was a tenant

184
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:57,548
I remember his tiny
clean white house

185
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,214
If you only knew Kakhaber

186
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,286
How many times has
your grandpa jumped over here

187
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,688
The whole world wondered

188
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:19,108
How did this dreary old man managed to have this beauty child

189
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,739
She would stand on the balcony, just like a moon

190
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,418
The carriages would
hold still at her sight

191
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:27,038
In short, man couldn't
ask for more beauty

192
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,194
I'll show you that
house right away

193
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,942
Everything has been changed

194
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:40,379
The house is gone

195
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,547
Wait, wait

196
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,339
Come

197
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,379
Thank you very much

198
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,015
You're welcome

199
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,122
Good day to you

200
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,269
Won't you recieve
some guests?

201
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,699
I wonder if he's deaf

202
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,959
Good day to you

203
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:18,257
Raise your head

204
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:20,135
And answer my greeting

205
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,596
I have grandchildren
of your age

206
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:23,853
Good day,
we have no rooms

207
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:24,809
How's that?

208
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,954
Won't you let me
spend the night?

209
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:28,071
No place, what can i do?

210
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,854
Shame on you

211
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:35,430
Violating hospitality tradition

212
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:37,373
At least, trouble youself a little

213
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,077
Apologize maybe

214
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:41,377
I treat guests in my own family

215
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:44,463
Visit me and scold me
if I don't treat you well enough

216
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:48,950
Men like you come 300 and 400 times a day, grandpa

217
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,981
You're also right,
what is there to do

218
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,325
Are you on a mission?

219
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,198
What did you say?

220
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,255
I asked if you're
on a buisness trip

221
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,599
I've got my passport
and money in the pocket

222
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,342
Got any documents?

223
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,965
Where are you
coming from, where to

224
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:17,211
My story is to be told
as a fairy tale, my boy

225
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,561
I'm here for the plants

226
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:22,360
What are you lookint at

227
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,234
I was told to get
some pear plants at the...

228
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,969
What plants are
you talking about

229
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,779
We're about to recieve
lots of scientists for the symposium

230
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,435
Mr. Sharmon is coming
any time now

231
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,021
Who's coming?

232
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,701
Mr. Sharmon

233
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,943
He shook hands with Einstein

234
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,136
Mr. Osada from Japan

235
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:49,550
In a minute

236
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,054
Good day to you

237
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,205
All right,
you take care of him and..

238
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:58,134
We'll take care of our own

239
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,247
Good bye

240
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,704
Excuse me, my friend

241
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,729
You said you are
looking for the plants

242
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,243
That's right, we're
heading to Zenati  and..

243
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:17,580
"Khechachuri" is the king of pears, as we used to say in old times but..

244
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,667
Right so, but you
won't find it nowadays

245
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,051
They extincted little by little..

246
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,199
"Khechachuri"

247
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,787
"Tarujula"

248
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,341
"Zape pear"

249
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,961
"Kacistava"
(manhead)

250
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,558
What a breed, what a breed

251
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:34,140
Now what about
old grape varieties?

252
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,460
"Ojaleshi" ,  "Aladasturi"
"White Odessa"

253
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,312
"KiKhvi", "Bulleye"...

254
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:41,629
How's it called?

255
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:42,793
"Chkhaveri"

256
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:46,676
I remember, I celebrated my
wedding with "Chkhaveri" wine

257
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:49,944
Now, what about forests..

258
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,193
I heard it from the old men, that

259
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:55,927
We used to have such forests,
that even a bird wouldn't get through

260
00:19:56,047 --> 00:20:00,998
Plentiful spring waters would flow almost everywhere

261
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,644
I remember,
my father used to recount

262
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:06,349
He came out in the yard, one night

263
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:12,044
Suddenly the wind blew
and extinguished his wick-lamp

264
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,738
My Grandfather  told him then

265
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:18,750
'Someone must have
cut the tree in the forest'

266
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,315
Right, that's so

267
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,252
They write a lot about it, nowadays

268
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:28,260
There was an article in the
newspaper recently, saying that...

269
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,210
50 million tree is
going to be planted

270
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,507
What for?

271
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,079
You won't snatch an
axe from these people's hands

272
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,651
You're right, my friend

273
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:41,669
Where are you from?

274
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:45,024
I am Kvintradze, from Kvakude

275
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,385
What are you saying?!

276
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:52,198
My grandmother, Akhaladze's daughter
was also from Kvakude

277
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,340
No, we are as relatives then

278
00:20:56,766 --> 00:21:00,419
My mother was also Akhaladze

279
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:02,840
This is my grandson, Kakhaber

280
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:05,577
He is a good boy

281
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,562
Thank you

282
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,954
Oh, by the way

283
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:11,072
The tourist bus over there
is heading to Tbilisi

284
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,521
The interpreter girl
is of our kind

285
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:16,570
I'll tell her to take you with her

286
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,649
Let's go, let's go

287
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,901
I sure do like to have a conversation

288
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,286
But I don't understand your language, what can I do

289
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,351
My girl

290
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,580
Come here

291
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,757
Tell me what this honest man is trying to say

292
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,839
Mr. Fletcher wanted to know

293
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,834
if you're also on the sightseeing tour

294
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:59,445
I told him that you're heading to faraway village

295
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,161
to get some plants

296
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,332
God bless you

297
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:15,452
Mr. Fletcher is very interested in this subject

298
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:23,334
Last year he also planted new apple seeds in his farm

299
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,219
Good work my friend

300
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:32,948
Khechachuri, my man

301
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,205
He says he doesn't know this breed

302
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,902
It's a pear breed

303
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:52,293
ancient breed

304
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,626
It grows as tall as an oak

305
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,815
It will grow so tall in 15-20 years

306
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:02,064
That you can hold a wedding under it's branches

307
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,780
The fruit it bears, is sweet like honey

308
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, and if you store it in a special jar

309
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,618
The flavour will be kept for over a year

310
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:39,736
Where are you from, my friend?

311
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:42,333
He's from America grandpa

312
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:45,447
You're from far away as well

313
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:51,702
Luka Odilavadze

314
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,816
Of course

315
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:22,602
I'll send it to you next spring

316
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:33,582
He says, that's his adress

317
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:35,275
Thank you very much

318
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,110
Here, hold it boy

319
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,139
Write down our adress
in their language

320
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,052
Before you plant the seed

321
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,325
Store it in the water
for couple of days

322
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:54,889
Don't touch the plant
for the first 3 years

323
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,292
Then replant it

324
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:59,028
It will bear first fruit
in around 12-13 years

325
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,927
If not in 13,
it won't take longer than 15

326
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,717
You know what?

327
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:41,427
Nobody asked a man
before this planet was born

328
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,082
Nor its destruction will be asked

329
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,728
Tell him that

330
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,231
Kakhaber, help me

331
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:08,100
Help yourself

332
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,994
You're of my age

333
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:24,128
So drink this vodka for me

334
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,316
That's the way it is

335
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,385
Help yourself, It's "Khachapuri"

336
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:38,577
Here's for you my friend

337
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,160
This is "Chacha"

338
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,033
God bless you! Here, eat an apple

339
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:37,104
Grandpa, grandpa

340
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,484
What about me?

341
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:39,643
What, you want to drink it too?

342
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:40,177
Sure

343
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,658
Say something in their language boy

344
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:51,420
Now I'll say it

345
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,246
Don't say anything bad,
don't embarass me

346
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:29,970
Rain, rain go away

347
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,098
John and Mary want to play

348
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:23,912
Grandpa, Grandpa

349
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,020
Here's road to Senaki

350
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,591
Have a nice trip

351
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:46,579
Good bye

352
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,220
Good bye, good bye

353
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:19,172
Visit us some day

354
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:48,351
Farewell grandpa

355
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:49,985
Good bye Kakhaber

356
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,091
Wouldn't it be great..

357
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,293
When I send those seeds
to that american

358
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:16,682
And Georgian "Khechachuri" trees
will grown on american soil

359
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,012
Grandpa grandpa

360
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,202
Teacher said that

361
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:24,706
American and our astronauts
will soon fly together

362
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,480
Is it true?

363
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,020
Yes, that's how we've decided

364
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:31,972
Host

365
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:39,450
Who is it?

366
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,521
Village must be
far away from here

367
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:52,188
Hello

368
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,666
We're passengers

369
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,543
and would like to spend a night

370
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,675
Come in

371
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,020
Blessed is the guest

372
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,471
Thank you my friend

373
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:14,159
I'm Luka Odilavadze

374
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:17,128
This is my grandson, Kakhaber

375
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,415
Hello my boy

376
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,223
Come inside

377
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:26,073
We're here for the plants

378
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,392
And night caught us on the way

379
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,787
Hail to God, peace to you

380
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:44,690
This way, Mr. Luka

381
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:48,969
Have a seat

382
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:50,047
Thank you

383
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:54,360
Come here Kakhaber,
its warm by the fire

384
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,534
I'll leave you for a moment

385
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:57,195
Go ahead

386
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,511
I got really tired

387
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,572
I'm not as strong as I used to be

388
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,686
Here, let's eat and the
fatigue will go away

389
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,133
Don't bother yourself

390
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:31,139
We just had a snack

391
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:32,832
Good Evening

392
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,046
Good Evening to you

393
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:37,980
We came across some
Americans on our way

394
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,475
And had a little feast

395
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,226
Americans?

396
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,447
I look at my boy

397
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:45,441
Such a small boy

398
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,838
But you wouldn't know how well he speaks in English

399
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,142
Good Evening

400
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,610
Ketevan

401
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,891
Good Evening sir

402
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:00,268
We're sorry to bother you

403
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:01,682
It's nothing

404
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:05,300
He amused all those Americans

405
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,029
Telling them all 
the things in the world

406
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,727
Who has the biggest eyes?

407
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:13,072
Octopus

408
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,345
Octopuses live in the oceans and seas

409
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:16,887
Where they hide under big rocks

410
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:18,348
Sometimes they hide out

411
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:19,832
in the depth of the ocean

412
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:21,721
Where it is very dark

413
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:26,367
It has to watch carefully for the loot

414
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:30,749
This is the reason Octopuses have moulded big eyes

415
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,500
during the centuries

416
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:36,441
During the shooting of a film

417
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,296
The tiger escaped from the crew

418
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:44,516
People were delivered from the
 trouble by a 3 year old kid

419
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:47,030
Who...

420
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,751
Time for supper, Mr Luka

421
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,131
Maybe the boy got hungry

422
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:55,086
No my friend, he never
 eats when it's time

423
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,256
We just had our supper

424
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,056
Thank you

425
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,598
If so, I won't bother you any more

426
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:04,380
Have some rest

427
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:05,644
Good night, Mr Luka

428
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:06,931
Good night

429
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:08,635
Good night

430
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,212
Famous french traveler..

431
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:12,406
Good night

432
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:14,122
Expressed concern about...

433
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:19,085
Plants and animals 
of the Mediterranean sea

434
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:20,896
He says that..

435
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:24,644
The sea might be
 dead in 20 years time

436
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:38,855
Grandpa

437
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:43,799
Go to bed, til you've 
fallen in that fireplace

438
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,933
Yes, let's go to bed now

439
00:41:54,735 --> 00:41:57,617
We got to leave 
early in the morning

440
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:35,896
Grandpa

441
00:42:36,777 --> 00:42:40,744
Do you really believe
 in existence of God?

442
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,254
No one knows that
 for sure, my boy

443
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,480
It's embarassing

444
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,529
What will the man say

445
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:12,520
Grandpa

446
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:15,132
Your hair's gone gray

447
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:15,855
Where?

448
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:20,702
Hair is that matters, 
who cares about gray

449
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:23,299
I hate shaving as hell

450
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,204
Say this..

451
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:03,214
Good morning, Mr. Luka

452
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,197
Excuse me sir

453
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,744
Excuse me

454
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:08,568
Don't excuse yourself

455
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:11,329
Good morning my friend

456
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,671
I heard your singing

457
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:17,173
I want to teach him
 all the old songs I know

458
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,337
 I'm keep telling him..

459
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,202
Learn these songs

460
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:22,941
Till I'm alive

461
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,851
When I'm gone

462
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:27,413
You won't hear them
 on the radio

463
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,558
Or read them in books

464
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:30,937
You're right

465
00:44:33,612 --> 00:44:34,446
Good Morning Ms.

466
00:44:34,678 --> 00:44:35,981
Good morning sir

467
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:41,605
Good morning

468
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:48,634
You've woken up 
on a daybreak, Mr. Luka

469
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:52,304
We have a long way 
ahead, my Davit

470
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:54,032
Don't bother, Mr. Davit

471
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:01,595
You're about to have a
 guest in the family

472
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:04,485
Help yourself

473
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:05,158
Thank you

474
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,544
Al those trucks outside..

475
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:28,549
It's about road
 construction, right?

476
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:29,836
No Mr. Luka

477
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:31,949
It's for the artificial sea

478
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:33,433
Sairao sea

479
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:35,659
Much been written about 
it in the newspapers

480
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:39,426
Sairao used to be 
the name of this village

481
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:40,206
But..

482
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,239
The village..

483
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:46,104
Is it going to be flooded?

484
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:49,571
You won't find 
the village anymore

485
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:53,629
There's only one
 household left

486
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,141
And they are also 
going to move next week

487
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:07,850
Mr. Luka

488
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:10,836
Kakhaber

489
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:17,630
We, people you
 face right now

490
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:20,038
We are neighbors 
and relatives...

491
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:22,927
Of this family

492
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,020
This family...

493
00:46:27,926 --> 00:46:30,949
Knows how to 
treat it's guests

494
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:33,463
Here, the guest..

495
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:37,047
Is never recieved
 from the back door

496
00:46:37,414 --> 00:46:38,100
But...

497
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,605
Don't condemn us 
today, Mr. Luka

498
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:45,082
Today...

499
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:50,268
The family is in grief..

500
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:11,424
I did sense, but...

501
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:15,981
How could I imagine
 such a thing..

502
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:22,018
One...

503
00:47:22,846 --> 00:47:24,507
Peaceful...

504
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:26,516
Honest working man...

505
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:32,240
Has left us...

506
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:36,212
All his life...

507
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:38,615
He was....

508
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:42,461
Dedicated to agricultural 
work and now....

509
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:48,271
The same soil is where 
he will find eternal rest

510
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:03,437
Orphile Vashakidze
 will be remembered

511
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:14,514
Mr. Nikoloz

512
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:16,529
The head of collective farm

513
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,330
Mr. Parnavaz, our accountant

514
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,675
My condolecenses

515
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:23,123
Close relatives..

516
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:29,377
Mrs. Nunu, his sister..

517
00:48:35,563 --> 00:48:37,530
His nieces...

518
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,106
Mrs. Albete, his wife

519
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,204
My condolecenses

520
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:53,549
We're all children of death

521
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,498
Daughters..

522
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,541
Great is your loss

523
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:04,715
The young should live

524
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:11,680
Grow up as a big boy

525
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:22,394
My condolecenses

526
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:46,409
Good Morning my friend

527
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:47,068
Good Morning

528
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:48,306
Apple, isn't it?

529
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:51,385
May it rejoice and fruit!

530
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:02,416
Good day

531
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:02,991
Hello

532
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:04,336
Zenati thrift, isn't it?

533
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:05,050
Quite right

534
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,003
Where's the chief?

535
00:50:06,123 --> 00:50:07,358
There's his cabinet

536
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:09,472
But he's not in right now

537
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,522
Here, he comes with his suite

538
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,515
Which one?

539
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,147
The tall one

540
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:16,793
We are not to blame

541
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,724
Working in the field 
from dusk till dawn..

542
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:21,671
Good day to you

543
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:26,418
Won't anyone pay us 
some attention?

544
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:27,651
What do you want?

545
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,423
I'm here for "Khechachuri" plants

546
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:31,250
I was told to get them in Zenati

547
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,963
And here I am

548
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,079
We don't have 
 "Khechachuri" plants

549
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,842
Don't refuse, I beg you

550
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:38,817
Bikenti, Yovel.. do we have "Khechachuri" plants?

551
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:40,691
No, no.. we never had any

552
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:43,885
It takes at least
 10 years to fruit 

553
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,153
Who's gonna wait for it

554
00:50:46,273 --> 00:50:48,629
We have to fullfil
fruit plans annualy

555
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,021
Oh, I'm lost

556
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:52,253
I beg you, help me out

557
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:53,617
Don't let me off
 empty-handed

558
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:58,060
We don't have those plants,
 what can we do

559
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:01,993
What should we do now

560
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,122
Harping on this "Khechachuri"

561
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,514
Don't you see?

562
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:07,026
No one's interested
 in it but you

563
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:07,777
Don't you see?

564
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:08,621
I see

565
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:11,153
Then let's give up
 and go home

566
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:13,460
Let's go

567
00:51:17,884 --> 00:51:18,886
Grandpa

568
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:21,895
Wait

569
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:25,740
Kakhaber, get it in your head

570
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,882
It's not only about 
'Khechachuri" tress

571
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,375
What will you reap tomorrow...

572
00:51:29,495 --> 00:51:31,694
If you don't sow it today?

573
00:51:34,233 --> 00:51:36,691
My grandpa must've been
 strolling just like me

574
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:39,591
Otherwise our "Kchechachuri" trees 
wouldn't rejoice by themselves

575
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:40,499
Grandpa

576
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,612
When I grow up..

577
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,929
I'll travel around the world
 and get the plants

578
00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:45,876
And sow them in our garden

579
00:51:45,996 --> 00:51:47,755
All right, all right

580
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,453
Let's try something out

581
00:51:51,886 --> 00:51:53,104
I want you to know

582
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:55,399
It's better not to go 
back to the village at all

583
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,923
Then go empty-handed

584
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,046
Let's go

585
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,478
He said..

586
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:36,948
The Sun is my mother..

587
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:39,533
The Moon is my father..

588
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:41,225
And those tiny...

589
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:42,489
Come now

590
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,075
Those tiny...

591
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,025
Stars

592
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:47,962
Are my sisters and brothers

593
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:48,704
Good boy

594
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:11,432
Grandpa

595
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,432
The well, grandpa

596
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:20,556
Come

597
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,626
Go, quick

598
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,633
Who's out there?

599
00:53:36,753 --> 00:53:39,497
Life and prosperity to this family

600
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,034
Come inside

601
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:44,819
Excuse us please

602
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:47,590
For this intrusion

603
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:48,611
Come in, come in

604
00:53:48,731 --> 00:53:51,069
No, no..we're passengers

605
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,098
And got thirsty

606
00:53:53,326 --> 00:53:54,184
Come in please

607
00:53:54,304 --> 00:53:56,765
Coming was your free will,
 but leaving is host's wil

608
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,045
Good day to you

609
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:00,213
Good day sir

610
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:03,059
We're passengers and 
we're in a hurry

611
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:07,695
As soon as you step 
in our yard, you're a guest

612
00:54:07,815 --> 00:54:09,005
Come in sir, come in

613
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:24,925
What are you staring at sir?

614
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:25,911
It's "Khechachuri"

615
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:28,663
Planted by my grandfather,
bless his soul

616
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:32,867
God bless it's seeds

617
00:54:33,814 --> 00:54:36,863
Who will sow it nowadays

618
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:44,162
This is the reason of our journey

619
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,435
I was told to find 
the plants in Zenati

620
00:54:46,555 --> 00:54:47,269
But imagine that..

621
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,727
It turned out to be a lie

622
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:51,665
Come here

623
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,852
Over there, Robinzon Dateshidze..

624
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:56,398
Coutivates "Khechachuri" 
plants, but...

625
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:58,283
What good does it do?

626
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,285
He's just a rude, 
rough man

627
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:06,841
He wouldn't trade
 it for money or else

628
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,998
Are you that interested?

629
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:10,524
You'll drive me crazy

630
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:13,724
We travelled through
the country for it

631
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:14,814
If so...

632
00:55:14,934 --> 00:55:17,278
He lives over there, 
on that island..

633
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,611
You'll get there by boat

634
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:21,080
Go and see him..

635
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:25,950
Maybe some miracle happens...

636
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,712
But I doubt

637
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:00,327
Host

638
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:04,339
Host

639
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:07,956
I wonder if he's deaf

640
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,206
Go inside, grandpa

641
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,977
Good day to you

642
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,762
I'm Luka Odilavadze

643
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:36,986
This is my grandson, 
Kakhaber

644
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,226
Come here boy

645
00:56:38,346 --> 00:56:39,501
Hello

646
00:56:39,954 --> 00:56:41,148
Odilavadze?

647
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:42,439
From North?

648
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,016
Yes, coming from
 North to see you

649
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,152
See me?

650
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:46,902
Right so

651
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:49,379
We've been told that..

652
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:51,721
One kind man coutivates..

653
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,576
"Khechachuri" plants and..

654
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,522
What do you need them for?

655
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:56,658
What?

656
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:58,224
"Khechachuri" plants

657
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:00,305
What do I need it for...

658
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:03,432
What kind of question is this?

659
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,882
I can't give it to you

660
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:34,350
What did you see there?

661
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:37,063
What is there?

662
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:39,277
The bottom..

663
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:42,588
The bottom is of "Panta" pear

664
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:46,973
This is "Naperala"

665
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:52,738
And this is peach

666
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:53,437
Right

667
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:06,735
I wasted my time 
in this early spring but..

668
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,501
Nobody cares

669
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:10,924
You can look out if you like

670
00:58:11,044 --> 00:58:13,838
The whole world is seen 
from here as if on a palm

671
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,291
Much obliged

672
00:58:15,952 --> 00:58:18,051
I'll give you 10

673
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:21,711
God bless you

674
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:24,238
Moscow train has left

675
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,563
If so, give me at least 25

676
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:31,811
Won't 15 be enough for you?

677
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,901
Neither mine, nor yours

678
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:34,327
Make it 20

679
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:36,924
That's all right with me

680
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:38,791
But in one condition

681
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:41,272
What condition?

682
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,732
Follow me

683
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:53,842
Here are "Khechachuri" plants

684
00:58:54,642 --> 00:58:55,918
Go ahead, dig them out

685
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,375
But...

686
00:58:57,495 --> 00:59:00,695
Don't pass this stone

687
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:05,369
What?

688
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,259
Follow this path but...

689
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:09,904
Only until this stone

690
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:41,777
Odilavadze

691
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:43,493
I'm not joking

692
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:46,266
You can take the plants

693
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:48,874
But don't go
 further this stone

694
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,615
Grandpa

695
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,545
Pass it from this side

696
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:01,911
Can I pass by from this side?

697
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,487
No no, you can't 
pass by from there

698
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:08,311
You have to follow this path but don't pass the stone

699
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,400
Shame on you

700
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:23,905
I know your kind but..

701
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,152
How can I slap 
the man of your age

702
01:00:27,408 --> 01:00:29,257
A man has to be
virile and honest

703
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:31,048
Even a mole can 
do the ploughing

704
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:31,939
Let's go

705
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:34,812
A man's gotta have brains

706
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,394
Am I to blame,
 that you're short of brains?

707
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:44,467
The blame is all yours, Odilavadze

708
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:54,418
Get up

709
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:56,922
Step right here, sir

710
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:00,147
Hold this

711
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,753
Drop it

712
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:19,962
Drop it, I said

713
01:01:30,702 --> 01:01:32,561
20 sapling is mine

714
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:34,252
You deserved it my Luka

715
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:37,232
Bring them and come here

716
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:38,216
Right away

717
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:43,687
God bless it's saplings

718
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:45,300
Look

719
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:47,144
How tall they've grown

720
01:02:52,457 --> 01:02:53,459
As I was telling you..

721
01:02:53,746 --> 01:02:55,416
Achiko had coupled eyebrows

722
01:02:55,536 --> 01:02:57,243
So we called him 
Achiko Browie

723
01:02:57,363 --> 01:03:00,533
"Achiko Browie! 
How are you doing?"

724
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,831
I would cry after him..

725
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:03,306
There was one girl, 
named Abkhazia

726
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,087
Flirting with him

727
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:07,370
Gee, he will die
 from happiness..

728
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,633
When he sees me 
after 40 years

729
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,487
Grandpa, who was
 the prettiest

730
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:12,813
Tsitsino or Abkhazia?

731
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:13,904
Boy, are you crazy?

732
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:16,232
There was no woman
prettier than Tsitsino

733
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:17,110
She was peerless

734
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,343
Peerless, that's so

735
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:46,673
Look Kakhaber, Look!

736
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:01,636
Didn't I tell you?

737
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,547
He's got blessed hands

738
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:07,832
It's Garden of Eden

739
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:14,211
Grandpa!

740
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:16,999
Come here

741
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:22,053
Let's stay here for the night
and go home by the morning

742
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,676
Hello

743
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:24,631
Come right in

744
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:39,039
Come come

745
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:43,232
Tell me this..

746
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,536
Where is Arqipo Ketiladze?

747
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:49,465
He's at home

748
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,636
So he's at home?

749
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:52,039
Go and tell him this..

750
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,346
A man at the gate
sends you the message...

751
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:58,163
Arqipo the Browie!

752
01:04:59,506 --> 01:05:00,816
Present yourself at once!

753
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:02,659
Here what I say?

754
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:03,595
Like this..

755
01:05:03,715 --> 01:05:05,581
Arqipo the Browie!

756
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,202
Present yourself at once!

757
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:09,175
The Browie?

758
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:11,030
Yes, the Browie..
don't forget to say it

759
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:15,609
The Browie.. the Browie!

760
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,568
Arqipo the Browie!

761
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,247
That tree..

762
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,742
Is it avocado?

763
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:30,328
Avocado

764
01:05:32,797 --> 01:05:34,977
Look how tall it's grown

765
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,682
The first time we saw it,
in Aspazia's yard

766
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,387
It was this size

767
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,503
Grandpa

768
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,349
Where's Arqipo?
I wonder if he's asleep

769
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:55,031
He is Arqipo

770
01:05:58,284 --> 01:05:59,409
Where's the other Arqipo?

771
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:00,835
A man of my age

772
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:03,096
There's no other Arqipo here

773
01:06:03,479 --> 01:06:05,438
Maybe he lives in
another household?

774
01:06:05,558 --> 01:06:06,493
I don't know

775
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:09,044
I haven't heard of another Arqipo

776
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:16,593
Good day to you

777
01:06:16,713 --> 01:06:18,738
Come in sir

778
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,046
I...

779
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:23,805
would like to see Arqipo...

780
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:25,092
Ketiladze

781
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:25,981
Arqipo?

782
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:26,978
Right so

783
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,118
Oh my, sir..

784
01:06:29,238 --> 01:06:31,657
You problably mean my
husband's grandfather

785
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:32,932
Probably, yes..

786
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:36,086
He's been gone for a
long time, sir

787
01:06:37,225 --> 01:06:38,698
When I was brought
in this famiy

788
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,694
He was 2 years dead by then

789
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:55,709
What did you just tell me..

790
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,841
Grandpa

791
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:21,812
I wish I knew what the
man sitting in there..

792
01:07:21,932 --> 01:07:23,466
Is thinkg about
right now

793
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:26,216
He must be thinking
 about the land

794
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:27,596
What else..

795
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:06,466
Grandpa

796
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,468
Grandpa!

797
01:08:13,535 --> 01:08:16,236
I'm here my boy

798
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:18,015
Grandpa

799
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:21,493
Grandpa

800
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:25,992
Things are bad, Kakhaber

801
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:27,583
It's about to rain

802
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:30,087
These 4 started to wither but..

803
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:33,450
I think we've planted
them just in time

804
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,079
In 20 years time...

805
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,954
When you'll get
on the top of this tree

806
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:47,645
You will be able to
see this entire area

807
01:08:49,516 --> 01:08:51,858
Untie the tree and
put the coat on

808
01:08:52,449 --> 01:08:53,655
No, my boy

809
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:55,545
The tree is weak

810
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,942
If I untie it, it will die

811
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:00,881
Put it on, anyhow

812
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,087
Come now

813
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:04,788
Granda entrusted me
to take care of you

814
01:09:17,072 --> 01:09:19,155
The place is not bad, either

815
01:09:19,275 --> 01:09:21,694
Yes, the sun will reach here

816
01:09:21,814 --> 01:09:23,051
Let's go

817
01:09:43,942 --> 01:09:45,600
Go inside my boy

818
01:10:03,474 --> 01:10:04,993
Excuse me sir

819
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:10,187
Excuse me

820
01:10:17,574 --> 01:10:19,012
Have a seat, grandpa

821
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,032
Thank you

822
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:44,742
Hello Chichiko!

823
01:10:45,392 --> 01:10:46,351
Boy, is that you?

824
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:48,035
Come down, let's have a cognac

825
01:10:48,155 --> 01:10:49,607
Which number are you in?

826
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:50,869
Right here

827
01:10:52,806 --> 01:10:53,762
What's this?

828
01:10:54,012 --> 01:10:55,422
Whose are these plants?

829
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,342
Mine sir, mine

830
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,097
Are they any good?

831
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:02,843
These are "Khechachuri" plants

832
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,661
What's this "Khechachuri"?

833
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,452
It's pear

834
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:10,649
Give me couple of saplings

835
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:14,795
I'll give you one

836
01:11:15,172 --> 01:11:17,166
Pick out the good one

837
01:11:31,674 --> 01:11:32,759
Take it

838
01:11:34,593 --> 01:11:35,781
How much?

839
01:11:36,012 --> 01:11:38,090
Don't mention it

840
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:42,991
Tell me where to plant it then

841
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:44,791
Which place is better

842
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:46,395
Don't plant it on stone..

843
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:49,270
Otherwise, any
place is good for it

844
01:11:50,275 --> 01:11:52,139
In 12 years time..

845
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,568
It will bear fruit

846
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:54,653
What?

847
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:57,534
12 years of waiting...

848
01:11:57,654 --> 01:11:59,120
For this?

849
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,843
Are you in a hurry?

850
01:12:05,307 --> 01:12:07,626
Funny man you are

851
01:12:12,964 --> 01:12:13,966
Should we go Chichiko?

852
01:12:14,086 --> 01:12:15,236
Come down

853
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:16,118
I'm thirsty

854
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:17,082
Come down

855
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:21,336
Follow me

856
01:12:27,193 --> 01:12:28,074
Wake up my darling

857
01:12:29,408 --> 01:12:30,289
My dear

858
01:12:38,715 --> 01:12:39,759
Eat now

859
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:42,008
My dear child

860
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,959
Eat now, eat

861
01:12:57,972 --> 01:12:59,224
Come, come

862
01:12:59,344 --> 01:13:01,346
Don't cry

863
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:17,517
What is it?

864
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:18,746
Excuse me

865
01:13:19,846 --> 01:13:21,713
You're Tsitsino, right?

866
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,452
Yes sir, I'm Tsitsino

867
01:13:24,426 --> 01:13:26,223
Hello Tsitsino

868
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,145
Don't you recognise me?

869
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:30,859
I recognised your voice

870
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:33,804
Your voice is still the same

871
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:41,669
Yes, I recognise you

872
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:45,298
How old you've grown, boy

873
01:13:46,562 --> 01:13:47,895
Remember?

874
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:51,184
Do you remember...

875
01:13:51,304 --> 01:13:52,749
Excuse me sir, excuse me

876
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:57,614
Remember...

877
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:02,695
How I threw paper wrapped
stone in your room?

878
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:06,104
It took me 3 days
to write that letter

879
01:14:10,922 --> 01:14:12,313
Good times they were

880
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:14,690
How many silly things
we've done

881
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:18,002
This is my grandson

882
01:14:18,122 --> 01:14:18,987
Hello Grandpa

883
01:14:19,107 --> 01:14:20,738
This is my friend

884
01:14:20,858 --> 01:14:23,092
We grew up together

885
01:15:07,697 --> 01:15:08,625
What is it?

886
01:15:08,868 --> 01:15:11,036
Tell me what's going on

887
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,819
The child is right

888
01:15:13,939 --> 01:15:16,080
You're not that kind of man

889
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,167
You'll spoil the plant

890
01:15:18,758 --> 01:15:21,645
You got greedy,
didn't you old man?

891
01:15:22,098 --> 01:15:24,196
If you don't know
 how to treat elder..

892
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:25,286
I'll teach you

893
01:15:48,052 --> 01:15:49,559
Let's have a seat

894
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,968
Give it to me

895
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:05,076
Grandpa, are you ill?

896
01:16:07,059 --> 01:16:08,659
I don't feel well

897
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,801
Who was that woman?

898
01:16:13,906 --> 01:16:15,178
What woman?

899
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:17,848
The one you were
talking with on the train

900
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,897
Did you like her?

901
01:16:21,017 --> 01:16:24,016
Didn't she still have 
that old charm?

902
01:16:27,339 --> 01:16:28,035
Yes

903
01:16:29,658 --> 01:16:31,073
Was that Tsitsino?

904
01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:38,562
How do you know
what she looked like

905
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:43,314
Like rising Sun

906
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,451
That's what she looked like

907
01:16:55,525 --> 01:16:56,916
Kakhaber, my boy

908
01:16:58,898 --> 01:17:01,503
Aren't Dilitauri mountains
 seen yet?

909
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:02,976
Not yet grandpa

910
01:17:04,715 --> 01:17:05,828
Do you want anything?

911
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:07,219
No, nothing

912
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:10,419
It's all beacuse you
took the coat off yesterday

913
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:11,625
You shouldn't have

914
01:17:12,302 --> 01:17:16,151
Won't you give up
teaching me how to live?

915
01:17:19,904 --> 01:17:21,650
These plants, my boy

916
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:24,380
You have to plant
them in the garden

917
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,702
I know, grandpa

918
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,390
Don't forget those Americans..

919
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:31,379
No Grandpa

920
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:34,538
Send them the seed by the fall

921
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:36,069
As it's been said..

922
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:39,014
One has to keep the promise

923
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:45,741
Don't disgrace me
in front of that foreigner

924
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,811
I won't grandpa

925
01:18:04,283 --> 01:18:06,186
Hand me that bucket

926
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:21,869
Do you want some water?

927
01:18:22,652 --> 01:18:23,974
Kakhaber

928
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,977
Hand me those plants

929
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,127
I'll have some water

930
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,358
Grandpa

931
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:52,842


932
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:52,842
Why are you up?

933
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:55,249
Things are bad, Kakhaber

934
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,208
When a plant withers like that..

935
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:59,201
It has to be rescued in time..

936
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:04,222
Even though I told him,
we had a long way ahead...

937
01:19:04,342 --> 01:19:06,506
But...can you imagine?

938
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:10,581
Grandpa

939
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:12,216
Here's a nice place

940
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:15,741
Yes

941
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:17,306
Get to work now

942
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:28,877
Won't it need watering?

943
01:19:29,317 --> 01:19:30,940
I don't think so

944
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,117
The soil is damp

945
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:41,714
Grandpa

946
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:20,404
Grow, rejoice and..

947
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,549
Rejoice others..

948
01:20:41,438 --> 01:20:43,478
Grandpa Luka,
have you fallen ill?

949
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:45,565
I don't feel well

950
01:20:52,843 --> 01:20:54,246
Seems as it has rained

951
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:56,472
Yes, it rained a bit
in the morning

952
01:21:23,028 --> 01:21:25,080
Help me, help me
(Speaks Russian)

953
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:35,847
What have you done, you fool

954
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:37,749
The brakes have failed

955
01:21:37,869 --> 01:21:38,998
Help

956
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:40,888
Quick, help me

957
01:21:41,008 --> 01:21:42,604
It will slip

958
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:46,372
Go, bring some stones

959
01:21:46,492 --> 01:21:47,435
Quick, till it slips

960
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:01,491
Go grandpa,
 fetch a big stone

961
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:13,012
Hurry grandpa

962
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:43,102
Good grandpa

963
01:22:43,222 --> 01:22:45,235
Put some more plants

964
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:47,275
Things are gonna be bad, if it slips

965
01:23:20,157 --> 01:23:21,618
Thank you, brother

966
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:40,046
I've spoiled such a good jacket

967
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:42,469
One has to chop his head off..

968
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:44,359
It had nothing to do
with the brakes

969
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:46,133
Must have been unexperienced

970
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:49,310
Can you drive so fast
in this moist?

971
01:23:50,295 --> 01:23:52,069
Wasn't grateful enough, either

972
01:23:57,372 --> 01:23:59,077
Let's go grandpa

973
01:24:45,057 --> 01:24:46,529
At least..

974
01:24:46,854 --> 01:24:48,929
We've stopped for the water

975
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:51,538
What is it, my boy?

976
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,121
Spring will come
next year, won't it?

977
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:02,618
The Sun is my mother...

978
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:06,049
The Moon is my father...

979
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:08,901
Those tiny stars..

980
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,417
Are my sisters and brothers

981
