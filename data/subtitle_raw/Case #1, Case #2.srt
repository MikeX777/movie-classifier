1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,250
First Case... Second Case

2
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,610
Those at the last two rows!

3
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,810
You're going to say who was responsible,

4
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
or otherwise you should leave the classroom and not to come back until the weekend

5
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,100
Your son is one of these pupils.

6
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
What do you expect of him?

7
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Does he have to tell the teacher who disturbed the classroom and then get back into the classroom?

8
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,180
Or is it better for him not to say a word and withstand until the weekend?

9
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,130
Should I give an answer?

10
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,210
It's pretty difficult to make a statement in reply to that...

11
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,250
Is it recording? Should I answer? - Yes it is. Go on.

12
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
My son did a right thing. Because they  may learn solidaity from childness on.

13
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Therefore, when they'd mature, they'll stand firm if there would be a battle

14
00:00:04,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Ofcourse, if he wants to ingratiate and desert his classmates

15
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,590
It would be possible for the teacher  to ?*?*

16
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,010
But when he'd grow up, he will definitely become an ass kissing, bootlicking and ostentatious kind of a guy

17
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,360
But by enduring and not saying a word, he will become resistant and then he always will have the opportunity to advise,

18
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:57,730
his classmate -in person- not to brattle at the classroom, and listen to what the teacher is saying, and show respect towards the teacher.

19
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,550
But it's disgusting for him to rat.

20
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,630
- What? - They haven't done a good job.

21
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,870
They should study. What are they doing standing outside the class? Not a thing!

22
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,190
I have worked my bone for him to study, not to do other things.

23
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,610
Yes! He ought to go and study.

24
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,530
I suggest him to retain his solidarity.

25
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,440
and not to get back in the class.

26
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:48,450
I do place emphasis on his keeping solidarity with his classmates.

27
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:56,530
Because if he tells who is responsible for such an act, the solidarity would be lost.

28
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,940
According to the thing shown, I believe it was the last one.

29
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,320
It's possible that the last one sitting in front of Mammad Reza  is responsible.

30
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
No. It wasn't Mammad Reza.

31
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Let's see. There were some people in the classroom.

32
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
One of them is hitting the table with blackboard-eraser.

33
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,390
The teacher couldn't find out who was responsible, so he sent children sitting at last two rows out and your son is among them.

34
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,470
Your son knows who brattled. Now, what do you expect from your son?

35
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:38,640
He's not a naughty boy. He never cheats nor breaks the rules in football.

36
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,280
My son is studious. He's really studious, even more than his older brother.

37
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know whether children did something wrong against him or not. I don't know what it's all about.

38
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,670
Look! Let me explain something. It wasn't Mammad Reza and we know that he wasn't.

39
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,710
There was someone else responsible. Due to the fact that the teacher couldn't find out who the brattler was, he has discharged everyone from the class which are totally 7 people.

40
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
The thing is that Mammad Reza knows who brattled. Now, which one do you prefer?

41
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,610
To rat about the battler and sit in his chair or to wait and stand up in the corridor for a week? Give us your viewpoint.

42
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,480
My viewpoint is that this boy behaved badly at the last row or they did hit the table with something.

43
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Afterwards, they told that it was Mammad Reza Barati's fault. Mammad Reza Barati never does such a thing.

44
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,310
My viewpoint is that I have worked hard to bring money home and he is spending it and studying here.

45
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,060
According to this, it can't be this way. No. It's not. I'm not in agreement with his doing such a thing.

46
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
- Does it mean he has to tell the teacher?

47
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,750
Yes. tell? tell whom? myself?

48
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
- Does that mean he has to tell the teacher?

49
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes. He must tell. He must tell who did hit the table and sit in his chair.

50
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Should I speak?

51
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:25,290
I think that the pupil who did disturb the arrangement of the class must be introduced by other members of the classroom, so that not everyone get involved in the a-week-lasting punishment.

52
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:34,070
The father is laboring. The teacher is laboring.  So that the pupil would learn a lesson and enjoy it.

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:13:03,050
If they resist to offer the name of the disturber, they have to miss the class for a week and it's not right.

54
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,350
They have to do it and introduce the disturber.

55
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:06,650
And I expect my son to associate with his teacher and introduce the disturber.

56
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Saturday

57
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,330
Sunday

58
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Monday

59
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,610
Mister! It was Mohammad Reza Ne'mati.

60
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,650
In your opinion, have this pupil done a right thing?

61
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,430
Please express your reasonings concisely.

62
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Let me say that, if their solidarity is favorable to us, naturally, it would be unfavorable to break such solidarity.

63
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:24,350
In my opinion, the pupil who doesn't resect their solidarity, -at least merely this particular solidarity,  regardless of factors, reasoning and the place in which it took place-

64
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,110
If the group has done something and one of them breaks that work, it'd be regarded as unfavorable.

65
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:40,900
No. The pupil hasn't done a right thing. The one who has made him express this wrong reaction is the teacher.

66
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:51,160
The teacher has destroyed the pupil's personality. The act is wrong but the factor leading to such an act is the teacher, not the pupil.

67
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:00,570
Therefore, the teacher is the guilty one. The act is wrong. I don't blame the performer but the factor.

68
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Undoubtedly, there occured a fault. In my opinion, it wasn't the pupil who did this fault.

69
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:16,940
At first place, it was the teacher who did a fault that asked him to rat. I mean, he did put him in the espionage situation.

70
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:33,390
Second, the pupil's parents who didn't train their child to react properly in such situation, and not to participate in the crime he's been asked to do.

71
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:41,630
Therefore, I don't blame the child but the environmental parameters, which is frustrating.

72
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:54,860
This child acquired a wisdom. When he realized that he had abused other's rights and it wasn't a right thing to do, he returned to the classroom. I admire his courage.

73
00:08:39,250 --> 00:17:22,250
Although he did abandoned his friends group, when he realized that the way he is taking is the right one, it wouldn't matter anymore. The other pupils will return tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

74
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:18,310
In my opinion, it's obviousely not right. We have to see how this pupil has been trained, what has happened in his home, to his spirit, which led him to do this act.

75
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,960
It's easy to prospect what'd be the outcome of this kind of behavior and imagine what kind of a man he will become.

76
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:47,740
For a pupil who couldn't resist, in his own opinion, he did a right thing. But it's the teacher who must not make a situation which leads  to these problems.

77
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Otherwise, you can't ignore the fact that resistances are different.

78
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:04,400
No. Definitely not. I believe that lesson is not just the framework which we see that the activity'd be justified.

79
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:14,850
In other words, it seems worthy to betray and get back in his seat in order to continue his studying. But actually, the lesson held in the back of the class is more important.

80
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:24,210
It's not right. I do even disapprove this pupil's work. Because this has caused harm to their group-work.

81
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,310
Since they have done something in return of the oppressive, painful session and the whole-group have left the classroom, therefore the ratter is a betrayer and in my opinion,

82
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,470
the other members should beat him to a pulp so that he won't dare to repeat his action.

83
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:43,160
This pupil's behavior, after he sat in the bench, is precisely showing that he's not calm and  indeed was pretty stressed-out.

84
00:14:43,190 --> 00:15:01,190
Maybe he was suffering a conscious guilt due to the fact that he had acted against his age-related principles. Therefore,  I don't approve such a work. Because he had done it against his will.

85
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:11,340
He was showing it by his mental demonstration. Maybe he was ashamed of his conscious that he was playing with his hands.

86
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,510
All in all, he wasn't calm and he was suffering and probably he would become abandoned from his group because he didn't support the group.

87
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,800
The answer is shown in the shame this pupil have.

88
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I think he has made a rightful decision. Because he has realized of the crime he was involved in. He knew the truth and he wasn't telling it.

89
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:54,300
therefore, after two days due to his inner challenges and conflicts, he suddenly felt that it's better to reveal the truth and he does it. In my opinion, his action was a positive one.

90
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:08,670
I am speaking about the teacher's approach which is to punish the pupils joinly. Regarding the fact that there's nothing going on in the class and  it is only him painting on the wall,

91
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:23,340
so the pupils become tired and the teacher failed to bring out the cooperation between himself and the pupils. The pupil was shown coming back and ratting against his classmate.

92
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:38,940
I, on the other hand, blame the teacher who punished everyone and caused someone to become a ratter. To rat is a sin in human-manner and in religious-manner.

93
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:49,310
In my opinion, the pupil's work was undoubtedly wrong because he  abandoned himself from the group. The human lives inside the community.

94
00:16:49,900 --> 00:17:05,900
he got his place on the bench but he suffered his conscious for the next semester or maybe longer.

95
00:12:53,120 --> 00:21:36,120
In my opinion, yes. Due to the fact that the subject of solidarity is illegal. The solidarity fails to find its high-value. Whenever, you suppose,

96
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:51,550
Resistance against injustice is a highly-valued resistance. However,  resistance against justice becomes wrong idea.  Resistance against crime is esteemed but against prohibiting-crime is wrong.

97
00:17:53,070 --> 00:18:16,070
this pupil's work is right and I think he have to defend his right and society's right and rat against the responsible-one who isn't anymore a valued-companion.

98
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Well, I disapprove this pupil's action. Like I've told, by this action the roots of this evil and naughtyness isn't going to diminish.

99
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:50,110
I believe if there's someone who wants to detect, investigate, report or discover social diseases, he'd better do it in a more principled and deep percpective rather than in a private framework.

100
00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:13,550
In my opinion, no. The way in which the thought-organization becomes valued is that it could distinguish individuals from eachother and could convert the members' relationships from communialism to individualism and

101
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:20,890
could expand this approach beyond political and social limits.

102
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,010
That means, here we are facing a regimented organization which is confronted against a group-resistance and

103
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:33,510
is desiring to break the group resistance  by one of its member's betrayal.

104
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,080
and it's symbolic and it can expand into all social levels.

105
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:47,190
I do condemn this pupil's action from  such viewpoint.

106
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:59,650
I belive this pupil has became mentally-troubled due to the  fact that he's feeling he had betrayed his belonging-group.

107
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:11,760
These feelings and these confrontings'd become a major trouble in future-era political society. (by this way of education we chose)

108
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:27,060
I think this pupil's action has two faces. In one hand, ha had a hard-to-solve problem (not be able to educate) to solve

109
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:42,070
In other hand, the friendship-solidarity issue,  however it's in a false context, which has positive aspects.

110
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:50,250
I thin k before performing such act, this pupil should have discussed it among his members so that they could find a solution together.

111
00:20:50,430 --> 00:21:07,430
A solution which wouldn't comprise abandonment. He has provoked 6 other member's hate against himself, not to mention his other classmates' opinion.

112
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:17,110
He has produced some difficulties in his relationships with his classmates, which otherwise was friendly.

113
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:28,520
However, he had a right idea that he wanted to solve  this problem. It's impossible to whether condemn or approve his work.

114
00:17:12,550 --> 00:25:58,550
Totally, I blame the school proncipal more than anyone else. It's him responsible for not letting pupil's put in this situations.

115
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,710
He should find a soft approach to solve in-school problems.

116
00:21:47,840 --> 00:22:11,840
To force the pupil to confess is a kind of inquisition. Inquisition is private investigation which foreigns call it "Ingisision"!

117
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:23,240
That means you want to reveal someone's idea/thought and you want to fribble with him.

118
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I think by such act, you are victimizing a pupil's humanity in order that he becomes your puppet; in what form you please.

119
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:58,150
I think this would harm the pupil's spirit and gradually will make the pupil disloyal towards his own personality.

120
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:10,420
It's possible that such pupil who confess against his friends would someday decide to betray (in an important situation)

121
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:26,560
This procedure is a wrong procedure. It's not compatible with Islamic lessons to force someone to testify against someone else.

122
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,660
I can even tell you a poem about this and that's Hafez's poem which goes like this:

123
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:41,760
"Take it easy with yourself, that naturally, the world takes it hard for hard-working people."

124
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:52,050
If you want to behave hard and aggressive, it would undoubtedly end up in a disaster.

125
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,010
SECOND CASE first take

126
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,930
Saturday

127
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Sunday

128
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,210
Monday

129
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Tuesday

130
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Wednesday

131
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,570
Thursday

132
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,570
Saturday

133
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,970
What do you think about theses pupil's teamwork?

134
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Do you think their action and resistance was a right decision?

135
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Please express your reasonings concisely.

136
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
In my opinion, should I talk now?

137
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:29,920
In my opinion, regarding the fact that  they didn't rat against their frind,  their action is completely right.

138
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:41,850
But their teamwork wasn't complete. I'm telling you this because they didn't benefit except that they didin't rat.

139
00:21:26,060 --> 00:30:07,060
In other words, the teacher learns from pupils. Here, it was a learning opportunity for the teacher to learn.

140
00:25:52,260 --> 00:26:02,260
So, because your work wasn't worthy for the children, the brattling and rhythming on the table had been occured.

141
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:17,410
In addition to doing this and not to rat  (which was a very good job) , pupils could altogether  direct the teacher to the better way of teaching.

142
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Pupil's reaction is very suitable. You can't expect otherwise from a human being.

143
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:35,270
Reaction is completely right, and if you're seeing something bad in this scene, it's the teacher's wrong-doing.

144
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:45,690
He must wonder why when he's apparently working, pupils don't pay attention and do some odd jobs?

145
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:52,860
In my opinion, pupils done what one could expect from them.

146
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,680
In other words, until we haven't train pupils <conditional>, reactions are always right.

147
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:08,060
And one mustn't expect other than this from people at the same age.

148
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I think that this solidarity is a good thing.

149
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:25,690
And the important thing which we should discuss and pay attention to is that

150
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,810
why this event has been occured?

151
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:49,170
Concisely, in my opinion, it was a reaction to a failed teacher. And maybe the teacher would wonder and think of and solve his own problems.

152
00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:11,940
I consider this a positive act. Instead of condemning I hope that we'd discuss and find the factors leading to such act.

153
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:21,810
These pupil's resistance was a wrong resistance. They have gathered and united in a nasty work.

154
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Resistance in itself is sacred. But their ambition which led them to leave the class together was a wrong work.

155
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:47,470
The reason behind this is that the class didn't belong only to these 6 or 7 pupil. Classroom did belong to everybody and one of them disturbed the liberty of the class.

156
00:28:49,310 --> 00:29:00,310
I believe we don't have a guilty child. We don't have a wrong child.

157
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:09,170
Guilt and crime belongs usually to the adults. Like the adage they say in doctor's clinic: "The patients have the rights",

158
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,910
because patients are in a hard conditions, likewise pupils have the rights because they're in a special conditions.

159
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:33,900
I think what they have done, establishing a week of resistance, it bears a  political and social credit to itself. It can give them Revolutionary mind.

160
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:49,240
and unity spirit. It can make them ready for establishing the country. Since they don't consider themselves guilty, this credit would credit 100x more.

161
00:29:49,890 --> 00:30:02,890
If they were guilty and showed this uniteness, it was different. Since they didn't commit a crime (it was only environmental factors' fault), it's extraordinarily beautiful.

162
00:25:48,450 --> 00:34:35,450
In my opinion, regarding all of the teacher-pupil relationship we considered here, we have seen our cultural and governmental values.

163
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:40,460
so that pupils show rebelness against system by confronting the teacher. and it showed the teacher's attitude against an event in a revolutionary society.

164
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:53,480
that he's punishing without prerequisite considerations and in biased approach. and it reflects that he's condemning a group for what a single individual has done.

165
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:01,970
In such society, pupil's group reaction is considered natural.

166
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:16,650
Totally, the movie dosn't show whether the teacher could find out the battler or not. But pupils didn't educate properly without distinguishing the troubled-one.

167
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:36,500
One was responsible. 6 innocents were raped of their rights. This shows that this teacher's other judgements weren't based on humanity.

168
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:52,000
Because according to Islam, it's better not to condemn a guilty one rather than accusing an innocent one.

169
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Because he would taste the cruelty and  there must not be no cruelty in Islamic organization.

170
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:06,130
I think it was a wrong work. I don't consider this a positive unity and resistance.

171
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:16,850
why? because they were disturbing. It could be a good thing if it held in a political atmosphere.

172
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:29,520
But in academic atmosphere where telling-the-truth ought to be highly-valued, it was a wrong thing to do for a pupil.

173
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:51,150
Regarding the training-program by this teacher, I think pupil -at least by their resistance- showed they are alive.

174
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,910
They're partisans.

175
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:10,130
training system isn't good. I believe, in such system, this kind of resistance is a best thing to do. They have shown they're human, resistant and fighter.

176
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:33,210
I think that it's better not to talk. it was good that they didn't rat. To perform team-work maintenance is important in this age. (It could be different in other ages).

177
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
In this cut, in this scene, this action was right.

178
00:33:48,560 --> 00:34:04,560
I completely approve pupil's work. Why programing the class in such way that he paints something and then he wants to talk about it? You can't expect 50 pupils in the classroom silently immobile to wait for the teacher to paint and not to talk about it immediately.

179
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:12,670
The teacher could paint it before the class, and by the time pupils has attended the class they would exploit it. So that the class would become more interesting to the pupils.

180
00:29:57,310 --> 00:38:40,310
I approve pupil's work. it was really good. They have resisted and totally, they fighted against the order, against the authority. I approve it. They did pretty good job.

181
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:42,210
They have done a very suitable work. And this kind of confrontation is what's suitable for the healthy society and culture.

182
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:58,090
Now, What pupils would decide to do to the rat is another issue.

183
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:04,340
But In my opinion, how they did face the problem was completely right.

184
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:20,840
This kind of work you're doing is to wipe up the dirty Arya Mehr culture which they always have promoted into our society.

185
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I remember it as a child. Not only it has been promoted in recent 25 years, but also recent 50 years.

186
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:40,360
It's the culture we've been adopted to because of the force and tyranny. that people should behave  in such a way in order to monarchy to live on.

187
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:47,070
to tyranny to live on. And it was indeed an  introduction to wipe up such culture.

188
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:54,810
The culture was based on training rats and it was started during school-years.

189
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:00,510
I believe what pupils have done is completely right. The right procedure ought to be this way.

190
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:14,850
This act which is not to introduce the disturber, psychologically and in religious-manner,

191
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,200
is not considered betrayal. But it's a  kind of loyalty.

192
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:42,190
It's probable that teachers and educational authoritites don't treat children this way.

193
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:51,940
This way is disgusting. Indeed, they are forcing you to betray your kind.

194
00:36:53,080 --> 00:37:02,080
We must act in a way in which  doesn't involve breaking loyalty among children.

195
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:29,390
As an cooperation or symphaty, they shouldn't use  children and pupils, the most intact one, as a rat or informer.

196
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:37,570
It would break their personality and spirit. and it would make them contemn themselves.

197
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Solidarity and team-work is potentially valuable.

198
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,860
But the issue is about training.

199
00:37:53,270 --> 00:38:14,270
whether it's valuable in crime, sloth and murder as much as in good-work, revolutionary work,  and resistance against cruelty?

200
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Therefore, the value of solidarity is related with the subject of solidarity.

201
00:34:10,990 --> 00:38:32,990
In this particular subject, it seems that solidarity has been exceeded beyond the subject.

202
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:42,520
In other words, it's stubbornness in an illegal subject.

203
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:55,010
It seems that in such situation, both teacher and  pupils should treated more casual.

204
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Therefore, solidairty is in itself good unless it's subject is wrong.

205
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:17,900
whatever its form is, resistance is sacred  and wonderful to me.

206
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Apart from what would be this resistance's incentive.

207
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:45,210
This solidarity is like the unity among drug-smugglers. You're saying if solidarity is valuable then this solidarity is valuable too.

208
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,220
I approve these pupil's behavior.

209
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:58,499
And I think the best way to support eachother
against a common enemy, regarding my background,

210
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:07,251
usually this action occurs among pupils here.
I inly approve them.

211
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:15,571
Although their unity is against our work and
sometimes it's necessary for us to be makebat,

212
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:24,624
I don't ever approve to be a makebate.
Because we can use their unity for educational purposes.

213
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:41,770
During recent 25 years, especially from 1956,
the Security Organization been established,

214
00:40:42,190 --> 00:41:04,190
which promoted spying in our culture.
When you consider recent 10 years history
of Iranian fighters,

215
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:16,756
Most of partisan groups due to such
spying and curiosity behavior among people,
get shown up.

216
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,230
Curiosity such as "Who is our neighbour?",
"Who are these people frequently come and go?"

217
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:33,948
If you'd remember, recently the Security Organization,
circularized to all register offices and real-estate offices 

218
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:45,598
to send them a list of tenants.
Due to the spying culture, 
Mostly, it was these neighbours and real-estate agents,

219
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:59,276
who informed the cops withought knowing
what disasters would be the result
of such behaviour to that particular group and
eventually to the whole society.

220
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:06,107
Therefore, I approve these pupil's action.

221
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:10,132
And if I were in one of these pupil's 
father's shoes,

222
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,248
I would be proud of such pupil certainly.

223
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:20,693
It's can't be answered whether these
pupil's behavior was right or wrong.

224
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:28,136
It's a problem facing all of the young
people and educational authorities 
around the globe.

225
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:34,033
In this case, it's hard to whether
approve one side or not.

226
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:44,177
Because in this case, if one of the
pupils would rat, it's the right decision
from one viewpoint.

227
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:50,237
But from another viewpoint, he has lost
his companies' trust.

228
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,535
Which means it had both a positive
and a negative aspect.

229
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:59,683
And if we approve pupil's behavior, well,
it is two faced too.

230
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:07,151
They had supported eachother but 
because of a wrong factor.

231
00:43:07,994 --> 00:43:11,994
It's hard for us to decide between
this case and that case.

232
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:16,385
Because it's two-faced in both cases.

233
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:31,496
According to age of the pupils, the school
environment and their solidarity,
it' hard for them to decide a middle point.

234
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:42,659
We must fairly understand this.
To face such mental disease needs
educationally precise action.

235
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:50,618
I thnik the answer lies in a series
of questions:

236
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:54,067
Whether the teacher's attitude was
right or not? How could we prevent
such situation?

237
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
The main problem isn't to
solve the issue in this case.

238
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:03,883
I think if they had a proper educational
system, they'd better find a reason

239
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:12,433
to find a reason of pupil's lack of interest,
-what we say pupil is a bunch of humanity-

240
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:16,452
Especially, regarding the fact that their
number is rather large.

241
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:22,555
I think they should find a cause, -there's
ofcourse a cause for them to withstand a week-,

242
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:29,805
I think why did they get back to class at last?
why didn't resist much longer to alter the system?

243
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:36,031
Again they went to the same class 
and same teacher!
This time they can't enjoy making niose too!

244
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:46,377
I believe their resistance was good but
it had a negative aspect that they
did get back to class which I believe they shouldn't!

245
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:51,549
Everyone has his own taste and procedure.
If I were in those pupil's shoes, I wouldn't rat.

246
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:59,774
Whether you want to call it fear, maybe
I was a little affraid in my childhood, 

247
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:08,259
But now, I won't do such action neither. 
Because I believe the disasterous outcomes of
rat that pupil is more than it's beneficiary outcomes.

248
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:14,943
Firstly, this thing that pupil is
forced to do is a kind of inquisition.

249
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:24,659
And he would become a society's gendarme
and inform the authorities regularly.

250
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,599
even if there's no crime occuring he 
would produce it.

251
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,838
He would become a makebate for no reason.

252
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:44,266
Ethically, I don't approve to rat
in one own's group even there's
a crime going on.

253
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:52,466
He must try to convince the other pupil
not to do disturb again.

254
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:59,810
To rat would end up in a disaster.
For example, the teacher would send him out
and the other pupil would do the same thing.

255
00:46:00,016 --> 00:46:04,016
And the chaos would linger on and
never be solved.
