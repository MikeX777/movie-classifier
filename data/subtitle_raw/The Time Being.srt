1
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,504
<i>There is a part of me</i>
<i>that feels a man has got to just do</i>

2
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,707
<i>a thing that wakes him up</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

3
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,309
<i>Things that</i>
<i>he can't live without.</i>

4
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,112
<i>Can't survive without.</i>

5
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,863
Good morning, Daddy.

6
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,733
- You wanna see what I'm working on?
- Mm-hmm.

7
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,968
Oy.

8
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,906
What if it's just me and you,
you gonna buy a painting?

9
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,742
Daniel, I love you, you know.

10
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,314
I know.

11
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,855
- What do you think?
- I think it's incredible.

12
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,424
- Olivia.
- Hi.

13
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,725
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

14
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,394
- I got to steal him for a sec.
- All right.

15
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,628
Okay.

16
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,032
This is the artist. Daniel.

17
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,967
Hello. Henry.

18
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,535
Nice to meet you.

19
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,371
And this is my lovely wife
Olivia and my son Marco.

20
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,308
Tell me about your work.

21
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,543
Are you trying to recreate still lifes?

22
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,679
Let's go see the lights, Mommy.

23
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,714
Not really.

24
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,683
How long does it take you to paint
one of these?

25
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,888
Um, how long does it take me to mix
the paintand put it on the canvas

26
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,758
or how long does it take for the idea
to develop?

27
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,728
How long does it take you to paint
a painting?

28
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,862
A month.

29
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,698
Really? A month.

30
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,333
Depending on the size
of the canvas, yeah.

31
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,335
Of course.

32
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,537
Well, have you thought
about painting anything else?

33
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,039
Let me find Eric for you.

34
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,831
You okay?

35
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,636
I don't see any green dots, Eric.

36
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,405
I really need these to move.

37
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,108
It's opening night, all right. You've got
30 more days.

38
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,710
Besides, Apples to Pit sold.

39
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,778
That's something. Where is he?

40
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,546
I talked to him on the phone.

41
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,648
He wants to talk to you.

42
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,518
He wants you to deliver the paintings
personally.

43
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,786
Do you think it's to commission
new work?

44
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,020
Mm, that's the idea.

45
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,776
I'm gonna go see that guy about
the commission.

46
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,515
You deserve it.

47
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,014
Hello.

48
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,617
I'm looking for...

49
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,885
Warner Dax.

50
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,703
I'm going to the pharmacy
now and then do some shopping.

51
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,841
You're stopping at the pharmacy, right?

52
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,722
Life is a lot less complicated when
you can't hear women.

53
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,287
Are you comfortable?

54
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,658
No, please. Sit down.

55
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,735
How's your family?

56
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,740
They are fine.
How do you know about my family?

57
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,742
I read it in your artist bio.

58
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,878
Do they support you?

59
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,114
I thought you wanted
to see more work.

60
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,884
A family that supports you.
That's grand.

61
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,654
I'm very lucky.

62
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,758
Artists don't have families.

63
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,599
You paint from photographs,
don't you?

64
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,235
They're my photographs
and I refer to them while I paint.

65
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,704
I would like to see something.

66
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,339
I would like you to film it for me.

67
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,774
Anjelica has a video camera.
She'll give it to you.

68
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,744
Okay.

69
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,912
Film the sunrise.

70
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,849
I would like to see the ocean
and the sky in one frame.

71
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,250
No land, no beach.

72
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,953
I'm a painter.

73
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,057
Well, then I'd better offer
this to someone else.

74
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,860
Perhaps someone who

75
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,296
has the good sense
to see an opportunity

76
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,231
when it is presented to them.

77
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,037
One thousand dollars.

78
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,172
Two thousand.

79
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,808
If I intended to pay that much,
I would have offered it to you.

80
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,848
- All right.
- Good.

81
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,926
- You want me to...
- I want you to do exactly what I ask

82
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,829
and if you do it well, perhaps
I'll have something else for you.

83
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,032
How long do you want it?

84
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,900
As I said, the sunrise.

85
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,871
Film it on Tuesday morning

86
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,807
and then bring it here Wednesday evening,
about 8:00.

87
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,208
Don't make any copies.

88
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,911
<i>The sun will be rising</i>
<i>and setting somewhere</i>

89
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,314
<i>every second for</i>
<i>the rest of your son's life.</i>

90
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,583
What's his name?

91
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,185
Marco.

92
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,322
Do you spend much time with him?

93
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,257
As much as I can.

94
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,192
You have children?

95
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,461
You mean, do I have someone
to leave my money to?

96
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,634
This is not bad.

97
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,303
I can create a painting
using these images,

98
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,273
or you could commission me
to paint something else.

99
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:40,545
So you are quite happy to whore yourself
out and paint anything anybody wants?

100
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,448
Look, do you want me
to paint something for you?

101
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,949
What do you wanna paint?

102
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,652
I don't understand you.

103
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,220
You asked me here.

104
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,122
I want you to film something else for me.

105
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,526
What?

106
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,896
I'd like to see children.

107
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,631
- Children?
- Yes.

108
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,968
I'd like to see children
playing on a jungle gym.

109
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,907
You know the park at the end of Venice Beach
near Windward Street?

110
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,578
I want you to go there.
Around 4:00 tomorrow.

111
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,315
No, go at 4:00 exactly.

112
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,183
All right, look, I don't know what
you're into, but...

113
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,020
I just told you I want to see children at play

114
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,490
and you accuse me of being some
kind of deviant.

115
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,458
Is there anything else
you'd like to say to me

116
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,327
or would you just like to leave now?

117
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,132
I work tomorrow, I can do it Friday.

118
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,568
Don't you think a man has to do whatever
he has to do

119
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,537
in order to support his family?

120
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,274
I'll give you $2,000.

121
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,283
Bring the footage exactly 5:00 on Friday.

122
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,689
Would you give me the card in there, please

123
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,079
I found a huge one.

124
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,747
You did?

125
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,450
- You wanna pick it?
- Yeah.

126
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,385
These are growing in really well.

127
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,435
Did you film what I asked?

128
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,438
Yes, wanna see it?

129
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,375
Sit down.

130
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,650
Have you told your wife
that you're working for me?

131
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,353
Of course, she's my wife.
I share everything with her.

132
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,689
- Oh, really, everything?
- Yes.

133
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,458
Well, if you tell anybody else,
these meetings are over.

134
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,498
What do you do for a living?

135
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,568
That's a very American way
to qualify a person's value.

136
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,471
I was in commodities.

137
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,739
Does it make any difference?

138
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:07,145
I'm very tired today.
Why don't you show me what you filmed?

139
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,521
Come on, come on.

140
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,527
Would you ask Anjelica please to bring me
some water?

141
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,195
You'll find her standing by the door.

142
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,441
- Warner would like...
- What is this?

143
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,916
Can't you even take a fucking direction?

144
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,451
I told you the jungle gym.

145
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,819
I thought the other kids
were more interesting.

146
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,588
I don't recall asking you

147
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,323
what you think is interesting.

148
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,791
- Look...
- In fact, I'm sure I asked you

149
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,294
not to think at all.

150
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,263
This is a waste of my time.

151
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,598
Get out.

152
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,966
Hey, I'm trying here.

153
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,534
I skipped work,
so that I could get that for you

154
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,469
and I expect to get paid.

155
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,605
You do your job properly,

156
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,607
you get paid.

157
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,675
Get out.

158
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,467
I thought we were cutting back on him
watching TV?

159
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,502
In a perfect world, we would be.

160
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,308
TV is saving my life right now.

161
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,581
Hey, that commission...

162
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,717
From Warner...
It's gonna come through.

163
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,928
I've been thinking I could focus on
my gardening.

164
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,798
Build a business of edible gardens.

165
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,303
I met this couple
at the co-op last week.

166
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,871
They're gonna come by
and check out our garden.

167
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,574
I'm gonna build one for them.

168
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,949
You gotta stop worrying.

169
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,951
You know?

170
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,886
Look...

171
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,756
I don't want you to dismiss me and my
work as worrying.

172
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,692
It's gonna work out.

173
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,495
I'm fucking exhausted, Daniel.

174
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,433
Come on, swing with me.

175
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,342
There's skid marks on
that underwear.

176
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,005
Warner...

177
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,876
I'll do things the way you ask
from now on.

178
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,717
- You want me to film the children again?
- No.

179
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,621
I'd like you to film the new exhibit

180
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,689
at the de Young in San Francisco.

181
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,959
It's on the second floor.
I want to see the whole room.

182
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,530
All the paintings,
when a tour is going through.

183
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,998
Okay.

184
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,766
If I have to go to San Francisco...

185
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,735
- I want an advance.
- Oh.

186
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,938
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,443
I'll pay you $2,000
for the new footage.

188
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,112
I'd like you to shoot it
on Saturday afternoon

189
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,649
and bring it to me
Sunday morning, 11:00 a.m.

190
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,218
Anjelica will give you
half the money now.

191
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,454
Go find her in the kitchen.

192
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,223
Saturday?

193
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,960
You said you would do things my way.

194
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,498
Okay.

195
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,546
Hey, Anjelica.

196
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,821
Where are you from?

197
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,190
- Argentina.
- Ah.

198
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,725
I love your country.

199
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,126
The warmest people I ever met.

200
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,534
How long have you worked here?

201
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,903
For a while.

202
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,075
And you do everything?

203
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,142
Most things.

204
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,750
Do you cook for his guests too?

205
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,253
Not many guests come here.

206
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,989
Family?

207
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,246
Follow me.

208
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,961
This is perhaps Edelman's
most reflective work.

209
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,863
There's a loneliness in this space,

210
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,732
and the sense there's a change coming.

211
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,200
A transition.

212
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,702
It's one of his most celebrated pieces.

213
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,314
Sir, you are not allowed to film here.

214
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,782
Sorry.

215
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:35,919
This painting...

216
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,180
No!

217
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,216
Good.

218
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,251
Total will come up here.

219
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,053
Gus, you got a spare apron?
I forgot mine.

220
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,324
You can't keep skipping work.

221
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,878
Hey.

222
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,290
Anything else sell?

223
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,898
I can't lower the prices anymore.

224
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,934
I'm sorry.

225
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,942
Can you do me a favor,
and call this Warner guy?

226
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,778
I can't get
a commission out of him.

227
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,246
Yeah, I'll give him a call.

228
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,482
I was thinking maybe, um...

229
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,855
I'm trying some of that conceptual
stuff you were talking about.

230
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,460
Maybe I could get another show?

231
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,530
Danny, I'll look at any painting
that you make.

232
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,098
But right now you need to go home

233
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,299
and you need to get some sleep.

234
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,009
Yeah.

235
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,378
Thanks.

236
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,985
Hey!

237
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,438
Is he asleep?

238
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:46,043
He's still in the park, smoking a joint,
waiting for you.

239
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,379
It's 10:30.
Where have you been?

240
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,948
Car got towed.

241
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,182
You couldn't call me?

242
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,250
My phone's in the car.

243
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,988
I'll be right back.

244
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,570
Marco.

245
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,007
Hey.
Hi.

246
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,075
Hey.

247
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,111
Who loves you, buddy?

248
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,213
Daddy.

249
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,416
Yeah, who loves Daddy?

250
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,484
I do.

251
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,221
Sleep next to me, Daddy.

252
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,289
Okay.

253
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,164
Go to sleep, okay?

254
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,269
I'll be right here.

255
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,470
You gonna tell me
about getting fired?

256
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,508
I don't get what you're doing
with Warner.

257
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,978
Filming more stuff for him.

258
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,179
What stuff?

259
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,316
Sunrises,

260
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,951
um, museums,

261
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,154
and children.

262
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:39,690
Do you have any idea
how fucked up that sounds?

263
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,958
Yeah!

264
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,696
I don't know who you are, Daniel.
You lie to me.

265
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:48,165
I don't know what you do all day.

266
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,367
You don't share anything with me.

267
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,735
I'm trying.

268
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,570
I'm trying!

269
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,506
You haven't spent a second with your
son in months.

270
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,575
And when you are here,
you just climb into to bed with him

271
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,243
when he's sleeping.

272
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,012
And that's for you, not for him.

273
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,584
I'm exhausted, Daniel,

274
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,619
and you're not here
even when you are.

275
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,591
I think you're just, you're getting
consumed by Marco.

276
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,194
Your identity will re-emerge
when he gets older...

277
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,199
This is the only time I've
had to myself all day.

278
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,167
And you're gonna talk to me
about my identity?

279
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,738
Get out of my bathroom, please.

280
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,373
Get the fuck out of my bathroom.

281
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,765
Daniel's here.

282
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,102
Would you help me
to the bathroom, please.

283
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,176
Wait out here.

284
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,240
I don't wanna get back
in the bed right now.

285
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,307
Okay.

286
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,455
Would you close
those curtains, please.

287
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,672
How was the museum?

288
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,610
I ran into some trouble.

289
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,281
But I got the footage you want.

290
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,849
Could you show it to me, please.

291
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,080
Look at those paintings.

292
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,683
That artist must have lived some life.

293
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,356
Guess you didn't see that in
my work, huh?

294
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,632
I have a malignant tumor.

295
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,606
I have maybe two or three weeks.

296
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,678
I'm not gonna leave this house.

297
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,514
It faces east.

298
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,718
I'd like you to film a sunset for me.

299
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,654
Go to Santa Monica on the bluff.

300
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:21,057
At the end of Wilshire there's a bench,
on that bluff.

301
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,095
Film it on February 25th.

302
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,933
Make sure it's a clear evening.

303
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,739
<i>Where are you?</i>

304
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:17,807
<i>At my mom's.</i>

305
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,044
You can't just take off like that.

306
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,881
What did you tell Marco?

307
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:27,183
For now, just that
we're visiting Grandma.

308
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,220
Please, come home.

309
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,589
<i>Daniel,</i>

310
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,925
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

311
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,228
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>else to say it.</i>

312
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,999
Why are you doing this?

313
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,738
<i>I'm not trying</i>
<i>to hurt you, Daniel.</i>

314
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,809
Can I please talk with Marco?

315
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,545
He's out with my mom right now.
I'm sorry.

316
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,616
I'll have him call you back.

317
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,302
What's your favorite part about this?

318
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:54,103
All the different colors we get to see?

319
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:55,638
Yeah.

320
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,812
What are the favorite things that we feel
about watching the sunset?

321
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,881
Uh...

322
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,183
- How bright it gets? How pink it gets?
- Yeah.

323
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,853
- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

324
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,155
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

325
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,957
Do you like when it turns orange?

326
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,024
Yeah.

327
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,228
I'm sorry.
Are we in your way?

328
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,763
No, no. Not at all.

329
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,368
It's really something, isn't it?

330
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,905
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

331
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,643
You look familiar.

332
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,979
Do you work at the de Young
in San Francisco?

333
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,082
From time to time.

334
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,751
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

335
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,620
I, uh, took your tour.

336
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,888
You were great.
It was fantastic.

337
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,956
Thank you.

338
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,028
I'm Daniel.

339
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,163
I'm Sarah Edelman.

340
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:56,199
This is my daughter, Winona.

341
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,900
Hi, Winona.

342
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,736
I have a son just about your age.

343
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,304
What's his name?

344
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,372
Marco.

345
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,976
Did you say Edelman?

346
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,044
I did.

347
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,882
<i>Any relation to the painter</i>
<i>Wim Edelman?</i>

348
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,351
He was my father.

349
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,958
I'm sorry.
When did you say he died?

350
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
I didn't.

351
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,294
But it was '73.

352
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,329
- Hello, Daniel.
- Can I see him?

353
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,775
Well, Daniel.

354
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,213
You have the footage I asked for?

355
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,771
<i>I'm Sarah Edelman.</i>

356
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,005
<i>This is my daughter, Winona.</i>

357
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,407

00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,176

00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:21,844
<i>What's his name?</i>

360
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:22,912
<i>Marco.</i>

361
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,216
I know you're Wim Edelman.

362
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,520
Daniel, these matters
do not concern you.

363
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,821
Sarah is your daughter?

364
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,792
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't say anything.

365
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:37,126
Look. How dare you?

366
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,063
How dare you

367
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,801
do this to me?

368
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,474
- Oh!
- Anjelica!

369
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,542
Are you okay?

370
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,914
He doesn't want radiation
or chemotherapy.

371
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,883
This is what he wants.
Understand?

372
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,982
His breathing is fine now.

373
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,118
He didn't aspirate.

374
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,513
Daniel.

375
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,388
Daniel.

376
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,463
What are you doing here?

377
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,540
My intention was not to upset you.

378
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:11,647
Your intention means absolutely
nothing to me.

379
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,282
Where's Anjelica?

380
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,286
I don't know.

381
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,590
You don't know anything about me.

382
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,093
My life.

383
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:30,399
I will not tolerate you doing anything

384
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:33,102
about the little bit that you do know.

385
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,573
Wim, I won't say anything.

386
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,978
You call me Warner and nothing else.

387
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,216
Okay.

388
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,089
Okay.

389
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,591
Go take a shower.

390
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,194
There's a room down the hall.

391
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,397
Eat something.

392
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,004
All the things that give you pleasure

393
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,439
eventually go.

394
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,330
<i>You should leave here.</i>

395
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:22,398
Go home.

396
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,802
I have nothing to go home to.

397
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,806
My wife left me.

398
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,409
Oh.

399
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,945
What about your son?

400
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:38,714
He's with her.

401
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,588
Well, then you've got nothing
to distract you from your work, do you?

402
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,561
Why don't we go outside?

403
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,769
When my daughter was five

404
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,905
I abandoned her and her mother.

405
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,976
Just got on a boat
and never came back.

406
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,783
I couldn't provide for my family.

407
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,487
It was an act of generosity
to leave them.

408
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:23,759
Generosity?

409
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,297
My work was more
valuable after I died.

410
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,606
You left for yourself.

411
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,807
Not for your family.

412
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,893
You know, I don't feel like I exist

413
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,329
if I'm not painting.

414
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,933
I don't want to feel guilty about that.

415
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:08,570
I don't want to feel like somehow
I'm letting somebody else down,

416
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:12,041
like I was put on this planet to provide.

417
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,716
You won't have any choice,

418
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,719
and I'm gonna die alone.

419
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,623
I'm perfectly willing to pay this price.

420
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,712
<i>Hi, it's Olivia. Leave a message.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

421
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,198
I saw your paintings.

422
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,137
Your daughter and your granddaughter
have to see them.

423
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:25,774
No. No one's ever going
to see those paintings.

424
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:27,776
I made them
for myself.

425
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:28,944
They know I'm dead.

426
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,448
I can bring them here.

427
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,821
It's too late.
I've lived this selfish life, Daniel.

428
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,828
I thought I might be like you...

429
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,166
But I'm not.

430
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,903
I need my family.

431
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:55,971
Good.

432
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,475
Because there's something
worse than losing them,

433
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,180
not being able to remember them.

434
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,734
Is there anything I can do?

435
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,372
He lived through his paintings.

436
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:05,773
He said you were right.

437
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,879
Thank you.

438
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,883
Thank you.

439
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:38,233
- Hi, Annette.
- Daniel.

440
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,667
Who is it, Grandma?

441
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:43,671
Daddy!

442
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,407
Oh!

443
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:51,846
I missed you, Daddy.

444
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,918
Me too.
I love you so much, Marco.

445
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,253
I love you too.

446
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,556
- Come see Sade.
- Sade?

447
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,524
- My bird.
- You have a bird?

448
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:06,294
- Uh-huh.
- Where's Mama?

449
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:07,662
Working.

450
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,437
- Look at that hill.
- That's huge.

451
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,407
Oh, do you see the Golden Great Bridge

452
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,843
- right over there?
- Mmm-hmm.

453
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:23,878
That's where Mommy's working.

454
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,506
My mom said you were coming.

455
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,343
I'm sorry.

456
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:34,816
Hmm.

457
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:38,720
Marco must have given
you quite the greeting.

458
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,855
Yeah.

459
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,523
Yeah, he did.

460
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,125
He tackled me.

461
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:46,627
He's big, smart.

462
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:47,695
He is.

463
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,098
He misses you.

464
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:57,405
Listen, I know I've been selfish and, you know,
I've been caught up in...

465
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,607
You made me feel invisible.

466
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,465
I realize that now.

467
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,616
- Biggest skyscraper ever.
- Ever!

468
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,086
Bigger than the biggest.

469
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,456
Oh! Argh!

470
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:49,991
Oh! Party foul.

471
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,029
Mother.

472
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,032
So this is Warner.

473
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,813
You spent time with him?

474
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,886
You were in his house?

475
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,056
Yes.

476
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,858
But they're all for you.

477
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,027
I don't know the man
who painted these.

478
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,064
You were always with him.

479
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,734
That means nothing to me.

480
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:51,939
- I'm sorry.
- He died a long time ago.

481
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,744
Donate them to a museum.

482
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,114
Oh, my God.

483
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,272
It's his life.

484
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,042
Yeah.

485
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,247
Thanks for doing this.

486
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,052
Could you do me another favor

487
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:21,355
and donate these somewhere,
like a museum?

488
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:24,825
Sure.

489
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,962
Who should I say is the painter?

490
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,032
Anonymous.
