1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,152
I loved jewelry.

2
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,909
Van Cleef, Boucheron, Cartier,

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,269
they tickled my fancy!

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,359
One morning, I packed my bags
and headed for Paris.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,232
I knocked on every door!

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,910
But as I had no credentials,

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,634
I wound up at the Ritz:
Washroom attendant!

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,717
I always loved luxury.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,957
But as I couldn't afford
to live in it,

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,276
I went to work in it.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,316
ORCHESTRA
SEATS

12
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,679
I was a naive young thing,
I admit it.

13
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,518
I always loved luxury.

14
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,235
Nothing but the finest hotels,
only palaces.

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,955
You listening, Jessica?

16
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,070
Sure, Grandma.

17
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,749
Found ajob?

18
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,995
Not yet, but...

19
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,318
- Still on your mind?
- What?

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,158
Your boyfriend.

21
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,236
Less and less.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,431
Don't stay here too long.

23
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,278
This place gets you down.

24
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,232
I like being with you.

25
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,194
Come and give me a kiss.

26
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,310
You're my ray of sunshine.

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,231
Could you switch on my soap?

28
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,873
People live too long now.

29
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,196
My dear neighbor, Augustine.

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,073
She's 92!

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,633
Her son's almost 70!

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,718
Know what?
She's ruining his old age.

33
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,950
The visits,

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,754
the worries, costs.

35
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,599
It's expensive here,
though it's not luxury,

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,552
if you've known it!

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,831
I always loved luxury,

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,232
but I couldn't afford to live in it,

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,511
I decided to work in it.

40
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,309
Did I tell you

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,238
how I got ajob at the Ritz?

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,908
No, tell me, Grandma.

43
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,469
One day, I packed my bags
and headed for Paris.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,999
I knocked on every door!

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,872
I was a chambermaid,

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,071
then a housekeeper.

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,156
Mornings,

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,956
I'd come out of the Metro
and get to work...

49
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,594
There were flowers everywhere!

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,873
Those rooms smelled so good!
Roses on the trays,

51
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,510
diamonds on the nightstand...

52
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,078
I always loved luxury,

53
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,672
but I couldn't afford to live in it,
so I pushed my way in!

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,519
Yes, I'm an experienced salesgirl.

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,912
I'm good in cloakrooms.

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,874
We don't hire women here.
Look around, no waitresses!

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,238
This place is special!
You experienced?

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,069
I've done lots of waitressing.
In brasseries, in Mâcon.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,599
Why's it special?

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,236
It's not a brasserie,
and this isn't Mâcon!

61
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,795
We're a microcosm.
Know what that is?

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,232
We get street-cleaners,
nannies, models,

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,237
- Alain Delon...
- Alain Delon?

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,991
Not every day, but...

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,715
Wait.

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,035
Come over here.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,155
Sit down.

68
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,279
That's the manager
of the theater opposite.

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,517
Breakfasts here every morning.
We're his second office.

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,679
We get stagehands, hotel doormen...
Everyone can afford our prices.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,114
Millionaires come when
they're bored with room-service.

72
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,710
A good ham-sandwich
makes them feel at home.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,310
And this area has no supermarkets
or drugstores.

74
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,430
Just us.

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,238
But we don't hire women. Never!

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,509
Why not?

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,269
Tradition.

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,472
But with the 17th coming up...

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,478
- Why the 17th?
- There's a concert,

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,989
an opening night,
and an art auction.

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,316
All at once. Think of it!

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,195
I got 2 waiters out sick.
We'll be swamped.

83
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,514
- Can you make steak tartare?
- Me? I'm a whiz!

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,271
Ladies and gents,
we resume at 2 PM.

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,352
You're in great shape!
Your wife's still as beautiful.

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,394
We have the dates for Salzburg.

87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,068
You prefer 11-18th of June,
or the 8-12th of July?

88
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,478
No, we're at Carnegie Hall in June.
Must be July.

89
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,873
There's still time.

90
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,599
2012 is around the corner!

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,078
Meanwhile, where do we lunch?

92
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,594
Keep well!

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,553
Hope you wind up in my cab again!

94
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,588
You kept everyone waiting!
You're a pain!

95
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,470
Serge, your voice isn't projecting!

96
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,033
Traffic jams, I presume?

97
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,196
We shot all night
in a freezing squat!

98
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,595
I slept an hour!
Thanks to the traffic!

99
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,351
So if you're even faintly
unpleasant, I'm outta here!

100
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,673
- "So you could eavesdrop!"
- "From the window?"

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,833
Doesn't matter.

102
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,156
Catherine, could I ask you to...

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,032
I won't do this play
with poultry on my head!

104
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,677
She gonna be a pain all the way?

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,076
You picked it?

106
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,951
No way!

107
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,437
- You don't recognize me?
- I do...

108
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,789
No, you don't.

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,197
You once dined at my house,
after your concert.

110
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,555
There was a fabulous blue Braque!

111
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,193
Right. I'm selling it.

112
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,518
I'm selling everything,
on March 17th at 9 PM.

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,119
Come, it'll be a good auction.

114
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,196
I can't.

115
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,597
I'm playing here.
It'll be a good concert, I hope!

116
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,591
- Come in. Take a look!
- Thanks, but I need a breather...

117
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,078
- You're selling everything?
- Yes.

118
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,030
Why?

119
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,393
A collection is a living thing.
When its heart stops beating,

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,794
it's over.

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,269
I began as a cabbie,
I don't want to end a museum guard.

122
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,239
I'll stop by.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,711
Here. It's all in there.

124
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,115
My complete works!

125
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,149
I'm quitting the show.
I told you! You told them?

126
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,236
They're devastated.

127
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,676
I don't give a shit!

128
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,952
150,000 Euros an episode,
6 episodes a year for 3 years.

129
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,515
You'll be rich, you can quit work.

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,151
I don't want to quit working.
Just that shitty soap!

131
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,355
Dessert? Coffee?

132
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,076
Herb tea with fake sugar, please.

133
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,791
Sorry, I hadn't recognized you.

134
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,758
You're amazing!
My grandma and I adore you!

135
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,989
That's nice.

136
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,679
No dessert, you sure?

137
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,869
Jessica!

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,149
Excuse me.

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,036
Never recognize a customer!

140
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,037
- But she's...
- Precisely!

141
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,993
Don't push our desserts
or make comments!

142
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,112
Never say:
"They're all coming at once".

143
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,470
It's a restaurant!
That's what happens!

144
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,556
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,949
The name's Marcel!

146
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,471
Any news from Alain Renais?

147
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,750
- His film's been postponed.
- Good!

148
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,871
He wouldn't have picked me anyway.

149
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,394
May we congratulate you?

150
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,635
Thanks.

151
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,511
You're fabulous!

152
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,119
We never miss an episode!

153
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,595
Thanks.

154
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,232
I've had it to here!

155
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,556
You're edgy. You open in 3 days...

156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,836
Don't bet on it!

157
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,234
What do you mean?

158
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,799
That assistant flaunting her boobs
and her dumb dad may do me in!

159
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,948
Working with your daughter
should be fun.

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,271
And your ex-husband's the best,
even if he drinks. Does he still?

161
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,039
Not even!
It's a nightmare.

162
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,310
The play's dumb,
I'm treated like a factory worker.

163
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,272
I added a chocolate.

164
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,956
Is he here?

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,276
- Who?
- He's in Paris.

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,108
I spoke to his casting director,
Magali Garrel.

167
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,595
That bitch?

168
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,394
She hates me! Forget it.

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,788
We were in drama school.
Her whole career was 2 walk-ons!

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,911
You've got to talk to him!

171
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,992
He's sticking to his list.

172
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,790
Sure, Binoche, Baye, Adjani.
We know that list.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,035
And Bellucci, too.

174
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,512
To play Simone de Beauvoir?
Why not Sophia Loren?

175
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,439
OK... he's in Paris,

176
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,114
he's staying at the Plaza.

177
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,156
I'll try to get him to cross
the street and see your show.

178
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,669
How was that?
You want to destroy me?

179
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,952
You know Feydeau's plays!
Wait till you see my hat!

180
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,073
Sobinski won't hire me to clean
Sartre and Beauvoir's toilet!

181
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,475
Listen...

182
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,148
I dropped off a tape at his hotel.

183
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,471
Of "Her Honor the Mayor"?
You didn't?

184
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,477
Working with slave-drivers is tough,
manic-depressives are worse.

185
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,674
I'm not manic-depressive,
I'm bipolar. It's not the same.

186
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,390
Sure. Try to get some sleep, OK?

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,715
I'll call you.

188
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,516
Wait.

189
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,358
How do you know about Bellucci?

190
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,713
She's my client now.

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,035
You kidding me?

192
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,589
No.

193
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,030
I'd say you're her client!
Bastard! Dirty pimp!

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,033
Bellucci!

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,791
Hi. Mr Lefort's dressing room,
please?

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,594
- Who wants to know?
- I work at the Bar des Théâtres.

197
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,199
They hire girls now?

198
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,630
Since this morning. I'm on trial.

199
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,751
He's in the presidential
dressing-room.

200
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,157
Across the stage,
up the stairs, 3rd floor.

201
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,157
His name's on the door.

202
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,395
Thanks.

203
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,190
Thanks.

204
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,914
Mint cordial, right?
Marcel wasn't sure.

205
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,157
- They hire girls over there now?
- I'm on trial.

206
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,475
- This is for you. It goes on my tab.
- Thanks.

207
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,435
It really is presidential here.

208
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,477
Sorry?

209
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,559
You sleep here?

210
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,119
I wish I did.

211
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,958
There's even a shower.

212
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,472
You ever go to concerts?

213
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,671
Not a chance.

214
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,233
Why not?

215
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,676
I like music, but that's it.

216
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,758
Classical music doesn't...
I don't know it well.

217
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,430
Know that?

218
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,795
Sure.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,072
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are</i>

220
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,875
<i>Up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky</i>

221
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,913
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are</i>

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,716
It's Mozart.

223
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,309
Drives me nuts!

224
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,188
I never learned.
No musical education.

225
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,789
Don't apologize!
I'm apologizing to you.

226
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,194
Don't. Why?

227
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,116
Because you're young,
you sing in tune,

228
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,834
and you never go to concerts.

229
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,156
For you it's another world.

230
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,237
A chic, snooty world, right?

231
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,992
I'm sick of it.

232
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,039
Does that surprise you?

233
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,116
Sure does.

234
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,719
You play so well.

235
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,754
- For instance, you're a waitress...
- Not really.

236
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,710
Oh, yeah?

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,548
It's a long story.

238
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,795
Anyway...

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,073
if you want to quit being a waitress,
everybody will understand.

240
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,554
But a concert pianist...

241
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,230
nobody understands!

242
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,351
Not even you, who shunt concerts.

243
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,039
Sit down.

244
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,353
Is it a very long story?

245
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,113
Once I get started,
I can't stop.

246
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,993
I've got time.

247
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,829
OK, here goes...

248
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,875
My parents died when I was little,

249
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,078
and my grandma raised me.

250
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,190
The Braque needs a better place.

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,115
I agree.

252
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,916
- You know Valerie?
- Of course.

253
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,158
It's coming along.

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,992
What's amusing is that
now I can sell them...

255
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,431
but I could never buy them.

256
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,637
- Mr Grumberg?
- Yes.

257
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,274
There's a man waiting for you
across the street in the bar.

258
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,197
- A man?
- Mr Grumberg?

259
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,116
Yes, that's me.

260
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,470
He's called Mr Grumberg, too.

261
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,313
"The Kiss".

262
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,957
There are 5 of them.
This one's carved in stone.

263
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,990
It makes you want to fall in love.

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,434
He'd appreciate that.

265
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,152
Brancusi would.

266
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,672
You're not in love?

267
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,148
No longer.

268
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,551
Jacques,

269
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,678
come over here a moment.

270
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,629
"What came over you?"

271
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,991
"No! Stop wandering around
in your nightgown!"

272
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,712
Wait.

273
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,319
Can I add a "please"?

274
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,917
"Please, what came over you?"

275
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,599
If you want. Keep going.

276
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,440
"In your nightgown,
wearing your hat!"

277
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,835
"I'll remove it later.
Now tell me..."

278
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,439
"Your hat be damned!

279
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,395
"A mother who changes her nightgown
in front of her son..."

280
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,477
- "A boy of 12!"
- "Sorry, 13!"

281
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,275
"No, 12!" Can I drop the "No"?

282
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,118
It works better if I just say "12".

283
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,197
But Feydeau wrote "No, 12!"

284
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,912
In modern speech,
it's better if I say wearily,

285
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,190
at the end of my tether,
if I say "12!"

286
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,355
Get it?

287
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,233
The problem isn't
modern speech patterns.

288
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,509
The problem,

289
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,517
if you can do it,

290
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,154
the problem is to find a modern tone

291
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,159
for old-fashioned lines.

292
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,869
Get it?

293
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,159
"No, 12!"

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,949
That OK?

295
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,828
That's fine. Wonderful!

296
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,315
"13, I tell you!
His birthday was 3 days ago!"

297
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,556
"Yes, well, 3 days!

298
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,557
- "Doesn't count!"
- "Yes. Nothing counts for you!"

299
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,957
Can I take out the "Yes"?
It plays better.

300
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,872
Felix, please, don't you start!

301
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,350
OK.

302
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,710
Thanks.

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,673
"You think he even knows
what a woman is?"

304
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,871
Is this Claudel now?
What's going on?

305
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,913
She's dealing with exhibitionism!

306
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,556
With her own body!
She's bringing up incest!

307
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,792
At last Clarisse is becoming more
than a dodo in a ridiculous hat!

308
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,352
I've told you,

309
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,155
in Feydeau nothing is psychological!
Nothing at all!

310
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,749
Nonsense!
His mother was a Polish Jew!

311
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,348
"Why do you wander around
stark naked?"

312
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,712
Sorry.

313
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,076
What?

314
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,195
300,000 an episode?

315
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,478
I see...

316
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,438
Put it there. Thanks.

317
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,310
I'm in rehearsal.
I'll call you back.

318
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,075
"Stark naked?
What about my day gown?"

319
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,191
"It's worse!
"Transparent as tracing paper!"

320
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,356
"I get it! Spit it out!

321
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,269
"You wish it was made of calico,
or madapolam!"

322
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,837
A few eggheads in the audience
may know what calico is,

323
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,712
but madapolam?

324
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,553
Is Shakespeare unplayable?

325
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,799
Shakespeare is all about us!
He's totally modern!

326
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,877
Compared to Feydeau,
he's a rap-singer!

327
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,270
You're a pain!

328
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,118
Screw you!

329
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,389
Let's move on.

330
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,795
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

331
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,072
She's right. "Madapolam"? Zip!

332
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,396
During rehearsals,
nobody comes in.

333
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,591
"Your hat be damned!

334
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,471
"Is it fitting for a mother..."

335
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,795
Jean-François!

336
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,558
They came from Tokyo to see you!

337
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,875
Tokyo?

338
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,469
They need to rest.
I'll see them later.

339
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,599
How's the faculty?

340
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,438
Still on the Protestants?

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,110
What's your next book?

342
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,078
"Reforms and Persecution in the
16th Century". I just delivered it.

343
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,716
Your text is crap!
You're spouting crap!

344
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,276
I worked hard on it,
and I'm not a writer.

345
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,438
"A transfusion...
the death of a collection...

346
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,319
"by heart-attack."

347
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,431
I thought Mom had the heart-attack!

348
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,077
"The Bible says: There's a time
to sell and a time to buy."

349
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,596
Why drag in the Bible?

350
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
Stick to Protestants,
lay off the Bible!

351
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,676
So, Claudie,
ready for the easy life?

352
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,950
She's retiring. It was her choice.

353
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,956
Shit!

354
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,631
OK, you can take a break.

355
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,398
Mint cordial.

356
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,634
Things OK?

357
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,189
They could be better.

358
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,549
And with you?

359
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,473
They could be better.

360
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,593
You and your sister
scorned my collection!

361
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,035
If I die tomorrow,
you'll screw it up!

362
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,837
I'm planning for its future,
as I planned for your lives.

363
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,828
It was all done:
You have your trust funds.

364
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,029
Thanks.

365
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,878
So, get off my back!

366
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,950
I know all about it:

367
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,436
You never forgave us for the time

368
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,269
we spent in auction rooms,
traveling, in galleries.

369
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,393
And the PTA meeting I missed
because of a gallery opening.

370
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,720
You bring that up every time!

371
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,999
I hated them!

372
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,317
I always hated PTA meetings!

373
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,795
And school plays with 200 kids
dressed up as lolipops.

374
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,831
I walked out after 10 minutes!

375
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,998
I shouldn't sell?
I started as a cabbie. I won't...

376
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,078
...end up a museum guard! I know!

377
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,359
You have money now.
You never spend a dime!

378
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,755
You want to do
everything differently.

379
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,432
You only buy computers
and cheap sofas!

380
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,673
If that gets your rocks off!

381
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,798
We know how you get yours off now!

382
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,153
OK, then...

383
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,713
Let's talk about Valerie,
since you know.

384
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,670
That's why you came,
so let's hear your version.

385
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,717
To you, it's a great love story.
To me, it's a guy getting fleeced.

386
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,279
My great love story
was with your mother.

387
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,398
So what do I do now?

388
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,273
Do I live or die? Well, I'm living.

389
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,349
OK, she's too young,
and it bugs you...

390
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,073
Because she's taller
and slimmer than your wife.

391
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,472
If that amuses you...

392
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,999
Sorry.

393
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,118
You know, Frederic, comes a day...

394
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,199
when time passing
becomes time remaining.

395
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,074
You see things differently.

396
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,392
A new life...

397
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,472
is like a house.

398
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,715
At your age, you build one.

399
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,558
At mine, you buy one.

400
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,519
Can I find a room around here?

401
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,597
There's plenty of rooms.

402
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,394
But a month's wages for you

403
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,955
will buy dinner across the street.
As for a room...

404
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,275
Got no family? Friends?

405
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,754
She's from Mâcon.

406
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,873
Jean-François...
You know my son?

407
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,390
The great Jean-François Lefort!

408
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,437
Don't you want to take a look?

409
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,312
Are you selling "The Kiss"?

410
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,075
I'm selling everything. Why?

411
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,670
Got a small room? And how much?

412
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,997
Room 412. Facing the street,
but with double windows.

413
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,668
Only 540 Euros. It's vacant.

414
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,474
Thanks.

415
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,315
Sir!

416
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,389
Mr Grumberg!

417
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,072
You forgot this on the bench.

418
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,794
- I didn't forget it. I left it.
- Sorry.

419
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,958
Something wrong?

420
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,399
I need to sit down
for a few minutes.

421
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,874
Is it your back?

422
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,550
That hurts.
I tell my grandma to sit straight.

423
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,591
You live in this neighborhood?

424
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,710
Neighborhood?

425
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,114
I need a room and...

426
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,073
This is slut-city! Look at her!

427
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,352
200 minks on her back.
Or her, with alligator feet.

428
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,471
It's not a neighborhood.

429
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,151
Unless you're looking
for a sugar daddy.

430
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,316
The place is crawling with them.

431
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,030
Thanks for all the useful info.

432
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,753
- Don't mention it.
- Bye.

433
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,589
Can I keep it?

434
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,755
Thanks.

435
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,995
I believe in God, but to me,
religions keep us from God.

436
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,678
As classical concerts
keep us from music.

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,879
She should write it down.

438
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,149
It matters.

439
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,312
Now the questionnaire
of the great Bernard Pivot

440
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,158
on his TV show "Bouillon de culture".

441
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,908
OK, shoot.

442
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,835
Your favorite animal?

443
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,597
My favorite animal?

444
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,755
The peacock.

445
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,792
It's like us soloists on stage:
Dazzling but dumb.

446
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,872
How do you say that in Japanese?

447
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,436
That's us.

448
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,914
Write it down.

449
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,111
Thejob you wouldn't want?

450
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,759
Horowitz's.

451
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,434
But that's the job you have?

452
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,430
Sorry.

453
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,310
The interview is over.

454
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,714
A pity...

455
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,829
Come in!

456
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,796
- What should we remove?
- Sorry?

457
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,073
I called them.
There's too much furniture in here.

458
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,916
Take that, that and that!

459
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,877
The dresser, too.

460
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,031
Want your multi-vitamin juice?

461
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,469
Thanks.

462
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,912
I'll run you a bath.

463
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,474
Take that... And that, too.

464
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,678
One day, he decided to sell it all.

465
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,997
To dump everything
he spent a lifetime amassing.

466
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,473
Takes guts, no?

467
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,351
In Venice, you want
the Hotel Gritti or the Monaco?

468
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,790
The Fenice needs an answer.

469
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,275
The work of a lifetime,
dumped in 2 hrs!

470
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,395
Hold it! "The work of a lifetime".

471
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,556
He's not an artist,
he invested in art.

472
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,312
That's totally different.

473
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,478
Like you, in a way.

474
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,628
The signed photo for your niece.

475
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,229
Thanks. I've got mail for you.

476
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,395
Shit! Can I come in?

477
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,471
There's more every day!
In that last episode you were great.

478
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,353
- I've started packing up.
- Soon you'll be on easy street.

479
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,394
Can I sit down?
They're due any minute.

480
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,670
More night shooting. I'm bushed!

481
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,438
They drive me nuts!

482
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,394
And tomorrow's your opening night!

483
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,399
What was the last episode?

484
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,591
You married a lesbian couple,

485
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,199
a dwarf and a paraplegic.

486
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,353
Made me cry.

487
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,351
So that's your memorabilia?

488
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,629
You heard of it?

489
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,637
I don't flaunt it here.

490
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,389
Pop music isn't Mr. Bercoff's thing.

491
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,912
My 30 years at the Olympia
helped me get the job.

492
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,995
But here I keep a low profile.

493
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,073
Mr Coquatrix! He wasn't fussy!

494
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,989
We had big stars,
but also acrobats, circus dogs,

495
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,589
trained fleas. The people I met!

496
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,391
Even knew some intimately!

497
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,036
I was cute then.

498
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,156
I met a lot of people.
Like Gilbert Bécaud...

499
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,638
Hejust came in.

500
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,114
Into the Bar des Théâtres...

501
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,230
Him!

502
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,392
Sobinski!

503
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,479
With that bitch Magali Garrel!

504
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,355
I'm not made up, my hair's a mess.

505
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,836
We shot all night in a squat.
I'm a horrible sight.

506
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,990
He's coming over.

507
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,309
He's looking.

508
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,073
No, he isn't.

509
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,400
He sat down,
didn't see me or know me.

510
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,318
Pascal, what do I do?

511
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,757
Think so?
What did you tell that dumb bitch?

512
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,439
Did you mention me to her?

513
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,114
Think so?

514
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,708
I don't dare.

515
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,913
I can't do that!

516
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,830
Balsamic vinegar
with her croissant? Why?

517
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,157
To dissolve the croissant.
Every morning! Take it over!

518
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,112
- Balsamic vinegar!
- Stay there!

519
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,668
I can't say it,

520
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,316
but when you married the paraplegic,

521
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,839
I almost cried.

522
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,075
Not now!

523
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,035
OK, I'm ready.

524
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,116
Scram!

525
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,199
Magali! You, here?

526
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,276
Hi, Catherine.

527
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,232
- How are you?
- Fine.

528
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,196
Sure, you're appearing
across the street. Going OK?

529
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,038
Sort of...

530
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,073
How about you?

531
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,948
- Casting a new movie?
- I just finished up with Blier.

532
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,474
You know Brian?

533
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,914
Catherine Fersen... Brian Sobinski.

534
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,237
I adored "Taxi Driver".

535
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,439
For me, it's...

536
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,472
Scorsese, of course! I'm an idiot.

537
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,315
Your last film was so moving!
The one with...

538
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,239
Help me!
You know that actor...

539
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,879
Magali, you know...

540
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,475
No, well...

541
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,875
See you.

542
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,915
Shit!

543
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,509
Dumb bitch!

544
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,039
Fuck you!

545
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,154
- Catherine! Things fine?
- Just great! And you?

546
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,596
Fine.

547
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,354
We're having drinks
before the concert tomorrow.

548
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,356
Drinks?

549
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,075
A party for you.
Your farewell is a big event!

550
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,109
<i>Hello, Lucienne.</i>

551
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,834
<i>Show in Miss Rachida Lahoucine.</i>

552
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,351
I have six Sartres to show you.

553
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,756
Her?

554
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,109
Catherine Fersen.

555
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,715
You met her
and hardly looked at her.

556
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,314
<i>Let's get to the point.</i>

557
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,399
<i>On Saturday, I'm marrying you to...
Mr Naoufel Larbi Lahoucine.</i>

558
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,436
<i>He's your cousin, right?</i>

559
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,239
Come with me.

560
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,274
Brian, it's unthinkable.
She's a D list.

561
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,993
You phoned the bar, so here it is.

562
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,519
Thanks.

563
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,190
Catherine Fersen! I adore her!
I missed that show.

564
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,796
You adore her? Why?

565
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,233
Dunno...

566
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,751
She's every woman, all at once!

567
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,554
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

568
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,269
<i>Are you in love with this man?</i>

569
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,918
Don't you have work to do?

570
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,553
No, I'm on my break.

571
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,274
<i>Don't cry, Rachida.
Women who cry don't stand a chance.</i>

572
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,795
Talk to him, Daniel!

573
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,639
Something's got to him.
What's wrong?

574
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,513
I don't know. He won't listen to me,

575
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,551
treats me like an enemy.

576
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,193
Says I don't love him anymore.

577
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,197
Maybe it'll pass,

578
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,674
but he's a mess.

579
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,869
I'll say!

580
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,833
You love him?
Get him back on the track, or else!

581
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,508
Here he is! He wanders in!

582
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,233
40 musicians! Seen the time?

583
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,192
I canceled the rehearsal!

584
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,197
- We must talk.
- Not now!

585
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,915
A TV crew's coming to interview you.
You forgot?

586
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,791
No...

587
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,750
Well, yes.

588
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,996
Go get changed, I'll see you later.

589
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,110
Miss?

590
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,236
A grapefruit juice.

591
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,959
Sorry.

592
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,915
I hate being late.

593
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,230
A man without a cell phone,
or a car can't be all bad.

594
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,795
Just impossible to live with!

595
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,118
Planter's Punch, please.

596
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,359
Glass of cold milk.

597
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,069
You...

598
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,109
You didn't tell him?

599
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,473
Why? I doubt he'd have believed me.

600
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,954
Why not?

601
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,516
He talks of you, not as a saint

602
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,190
but as a kind of monk
or a preacher...

603
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,149
The idea of you and I
having had a torrid affair,

604
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,078
hejust wouldn't get it.

605
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,277
No chance he'II?

606
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,472
He's in London till tonight.

607
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,119
I wanted to tell you...

608
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,677
My wife and I, that's all over.

609
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,796
What? I'm staggered.

610
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,310
You left her?

611
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,076
Surprised?

612
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,310
Frankly, yes.

613
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,919
Why?

614
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,428
A man who's a pain to his mistress,
can only be a pain to his wife.

615
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,470
Your ulcer?

616
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,510
Yes... no.

617
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,756
It moved. No big deal.

618
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,839
Was I such a pain?

619
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,998
Your problems with your father.

620
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,476
Well, your mother's death, OK.

621
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,476
But your ulcer...

622
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,276
your hatred of De Guise
and Queen Catherine...

623
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,119
your fears
your wife would catch us...

624
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,032
- Yet we got on well at the time.
- Thanks to me, no?

625
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,999
Maybe.

626
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,156
Things have changed.

627
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,114
I have a cell phone now.
So if you feel like...

628
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,832
You're kidding me?

629
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,557
There's a man in my life,
hadn't you heard?

630
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,034
Is that a problem?

631
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,309
That kind of stuff
doesn't turn me on.

632
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,597
But you knew he was my dad?

633
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,275
So what?

634
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,153
Is he your good deed,
or your good deal?

635
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,678
I have fun with him.

636
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,919
He teaches me things,
takes me places.

637
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,632
He's proud of me.

638
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,229
- He calls me "sweetie".
- You don't say.

639
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,877
He shows me off to people.

640
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,954
He's full of pep, he loves life.

641
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,388
And you love money.

642
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,512
OK, I love money.
But I'm not a thief, Fred.

643
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,516
Don't call me Fred.

644
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,751
We won't marry, I don't want kids.

645
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,349
- That's a relief!
- So don't fuck us up!

646
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,231
Anything else, miss?

647
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,714
Know what?

648
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,357
If you want to, tell him.

649
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,552
Tell him we were lovers
for 3 months, 3 years ago.

650
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,354
I don't care.

651
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,430
It'll just cause him a little pain.

652
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,592
That's what you want, right?

653
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,874
This is on me.

654
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,719
Now that I'm rich!

655
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,235
That's on me. May I?

656
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,440
You overheard it all.
So tell me what you think.

657
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,311
I didn't mean to...

658
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,919
- What's your name?
- Jessica.

659
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,633
Another cold milk. What'll you have?

660
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,114
Well...

661
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,034
OK, a Planter's Punch.

662
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,556
- Still your back?
- It's agony!

663
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,395
What's your name?

664
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,148
Frederic.

665
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,399
Tell me,
why do you hate Queen Catherine?

666
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,960
I study and teach
the Wars of Religion.

667
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,957
In fact, she fascinates me.

668
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,913
But that little gold-digger
never got it.

669
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,909
- Did you find a room?
- I'm leaving, anyway.

670
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,270
I live in Mâcon,
to be near my grandma.

671
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,357
She raised me, and now she's...

672
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,232
Raised you badly, it seems.

673
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,429
Right.

674
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,518
She taught me
that a sweet tooth and curiosity

675
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,312
never killed the cat.

676
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,670
Listening to you two
was like watching

677
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,836
"The Bold and the Beautiful".

678
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,631
- Where do you teach?
- The Sorbonne.

679
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,910
But I'm changing my whole life.

680
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,076
- You tore it out?
- Yes.

681
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,915
Was it the Brancusi?

682
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,995
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

683
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,954
Even touched it.

684
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,271
My mother's favorite piece.

685
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,438
Put it back in there.

686
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,834
No, you keep it.

687
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,393
Who the hell is that?

688
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,592
What's the gold-digger's name?

689
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,872
Valérie. Why?

690
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,399
She knows her way around.

691
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,152
You want to go back to her?

692
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,749
No, just testing her...

693
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,357
So it's macho stuff. Pathetic.

694
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,716
So what's your exemplary life?

695
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,280
It's a long story,
and once I get going...

696
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,311
If it's too long, I'll stop you.

697
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,868
To start,
I lost my parents when I was 4.

698
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,675
This year, my boyfriend dumped me,
so did my midwifery school:

699
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,395
A doc tried to rape me,
and I kneed him in the balls.

700
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,274
So I think my luck's due to change,

701
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,471
and things'll get better.

702
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,839
What makes you think that?

703
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,598
There's two kinds of people.

704
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,554
Those who say, when their phone rings
"Who the hell's that?"

705
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,593
And those, like me, who say,
"Hey!

706
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,279
"Who can that be?"

707
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,480
- Looks yummy!
- A peach melba, please!

708
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,636
We have contracts
for the next 6 years, all signed!

709
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,033
Would you leave me?

710
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,314
Answer.

711
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,316
I love you for your playing.
A plumber or a banker,

712
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,272
I wouldn't look at! That suit you?

713
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,950
I'm a pianist, always will be.
It's my life.

714
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,071
But I'm fed up with all this.

715
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,635
I want to play in hospitals,
forests,

716
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,195
for sick kids,
old folks' homes, prisons,

717
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,473
and in concert halls
where people don't understand music.

718
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,798
But I'm through with this ritual,
this costume.

719
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,036
I want out of the goddam system!

720
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,356
We're ready for you
on stage, Mr Lefort!

721
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,394
Where do I fit in all this?

722
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,513
Am I part of the system?

723
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,199
That's up to you.

724
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,159
Listen, in 6 years...

725
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,150
Don't talk about contracts, dates,
or how I'll go broke.

726
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,032
Talk to me about us!

727
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,509
I'll touch up your nose, it's shiny.

728
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,712
I'll teach piano,
you and I in a house by a lake...

729
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,393
No more travels, less money...

730
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,309
Will you kill yourself?

731
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,074
I might.

732
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,269
Yes?

733
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,073
I'm still on the train.

734
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,999
I'll be in Paris soon.
It all went fine.

735
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,434
See you soon, sweetie.

736
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,471
I can't wait to see you, too.

737
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,315
Feels weird, huh?

738
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,359
Doesn't it!

739
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,189
They got it all wrong.

740
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,508
This phony replica.

741
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,271
After Tutankhamen's tomb,
Mistinguett's bathroom,

742
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,313
now we get
"The Grumbergs' apartment".

743
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,873
Can you give me a hand?

744
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,159
Rack of lamb for me.

745
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,678
Me, too.
And a bottle of 1995 Marbuzet.

746
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,359
You speak French well.

747
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,791
Who the hell's that?

748
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,430
How about that!

749
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,200
But I've played
all kinds of other roles.

750
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,550
In Koltes, Duras,

751
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,715
Lorca...

752
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,640
I like Feydeau because...
no psychology.

753
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,878
An incredible life...

754
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,991
he died crazy...

755
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,150
His mother was a Polish Jew.

756
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,272
Let's talk about Simone.

757
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,629
Excuse me.

758
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,953
You wanted to talk to me
about the script.

759
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,949
Sorry...

760
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,232
I had no time for lunch...

761
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,950
It takes place in college,

762
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,832
then the start of the affair
between Beauvoir and Sartre...

763
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,270
until she met the American...

764
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,039
What renouncing?
Simone renounced nothing!

765
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,198
She was sex-mad
under her holier-than-thou airs.

766
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,870
She went after Algren,
seduced him, then dumped him.

767
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,679
There was no ambiguity!

768
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,952
Sartre was a lousy lay.
That's all. Yes, he was.

769
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,388
She was the wild one!

770
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,112
She let him screw around
with a lot of bimbos,

771
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,231
supposedly with her blessing,

772
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,475
suffering hell,

773
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,628
even posed as a lesbian
to swipe girls who coveted him.

774
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,708
She was diabolical!

775
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,198
The turban, the hair parted down
the middle was all sham.

776
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,356
Beneath it, she was a tornado!
Balsamic vinegar, please!

777
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,118
She was the rebel!

778
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,356
Who got mangled,
who fought to stand up to men!

779
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,028
Who was ageless.
Look, I can be any age.

780
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,068
It's the role of my life.
Beauvoir is me.

781
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,793
She's in my blood.

782
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,111
Don't listen to the crap
they say about me.

783
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,512
Please, not now!

784
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,193
Know what I'm paid for one episode
of "Her Honor the Mayor"?

785
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,832
Whenever you're ready.

786
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,870
Fine.

787
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,592
I'll do a last voice test.

788
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,075
I needed a dresser
and a chair, a room, in fact.

789
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,073
I had my things moved.

790
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,070
It's true, I made an investment.

791
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,272
I put all my energy and love
into your career.

792
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,635
It wasn't a sacrifice.

793
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,714
I never regretted it.
We didn't have kids.

794
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,114
I can handle that.

795
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,234
Manager, dresser, secretary,

796
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,069
nurse... I'm happy to do it,
it's a pleasure!

797
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,196
But a housemaid in the country,

798
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,428
I'm not sure I could.

799
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,798
Think it over, please.

800
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,073
You, too.

801
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,673
Whenever you're ready!

802
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,195
- You checked the lights "full on"?
- Everything's OK.

803
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,230
I wanted that lamp... Higher!

804
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,479
I went to see my grandpa.
Too bad, you never met him.

805
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,668
He said to me:

806
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,316
"I think it's ugly, but that's good.

807
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,239
"Only buy things other people hate!"

808
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,949
That's better.

809
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,913
Yes, better.

810
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,760
Your mother and I
did well for ourselves.

811
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,359
We handled all the trickiest
twists and turns of life:

812
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,236
Loss of desire, wrinkles,
my by-passes...

813
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,592
Know how? We both had
a hard-on for life every day,

814
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,870
for 30...

815
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,868
No, 40 years,
thanks to this collection,

816
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,719
we built a dam against boredom,

817
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,478
against time...

818
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,114
Like two beavers,

819
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,880
adding twig after twig...

820
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,639
Is your back hurting?

821
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,558
No, not at all.

822
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,110
What's that?

823
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,158
Sorry,
I was looking for the way out.

824
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,270
Hello, anyway.

825
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,552
Hi. You said I could drop by, so...

826
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,670
Come in.

827
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,193
Catherine... Jessica.

828
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,196
So still no room?

829
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,392
Tomorrow, maybe. But for tonight...
This place is cool.

830
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,989
You can have Gilbert's sofa.

831
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,159
The springs are shot, but
it's a bed of feathers, trust me.

832
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,914
I'm sentenced to prime-time TV
for life.

833
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,915
It's true!

834
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,717
Kusturica, Resnais? Forget them!

835
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,196
Sobinski thought
I was a suicidal maniac. And I am!

836
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,597
Anyway, thank God,

837
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,836
there's Feydeau, "Popstars"...

838
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,109
You were on "Popstars"?

839
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,113
Yes, every year.

840
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,318
There! That feels great.

841
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,468
Piaf used to say:
"You have the fingers of an angel".

842
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,111
What did Bécaud say
when you tweaked his wienie?

843
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,712
Water's boiling.

844
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,595
- Pasta shells or macaroni?
- Pasta shells!

845
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,634
For me, life's simple.

846
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,317
For you two, it's trickier.

847
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,909
Mine's simple too: She's leaving me.

848
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,633
Mine already left.

849
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,671
- Your wife?
- I'm such a pain.

850
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,029
So is she!

851
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,671
Mine's scared:

852
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,958
The two of us without all this,

853
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,037
alone in the countryside, no kids.

854
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,549
But it doesn't bother me,
I love her!

855
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,069
Well mine left me,
but I was through with her.

856
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,115
For 13 years,
she's been at all my concerts.

857
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,117
Uncompromising, strong beliefs...

858
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,676
What?

859
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,035
Uncompromising is bad enough,

860
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,631
but strong beliefs, too!

861
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,914
You're both too young.

862
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,319
You too!

863
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,989
She took the elevator with you?

864
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,350
Going up? Good.

865
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,557
Now you want to go back down?

866
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,955
If she won't go down with you,
forget her!

867
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,879
Open the doors and boot her out.

868
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,512
Is she a musician?

869
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,393
- She plays the cello.
- There you are...

870
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,115
<i>She lived through you.
If you take that away,</i>

871
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,230
what's she got left?

872
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,954
Don't listen. He's got theories
about everything nowadays.

873
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,716
To Valerie!

874
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,590
Who's Valerie?

875
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,753
A cute little golddigger, very nice

876
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,439
and smart.

877
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,314
Am I right?

878
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,753
I love Valentine.

879
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,036
Nobody gets what they want, Jessica!

880
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,357
- But you have what everybody wants.
- Yeah, right.

881
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,239
Any balsamic?
I'm a compulsive eater.

882
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,159
In the restaurant, now here.

883
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,517
I peep at the audience
before the curtain goes up.

884
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,474
Someone's always hoping
to pounce on a closer seat.

885
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,069
They watch a free seat
till the last minute.

886
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,033
When the lights go down,
the fastest idiot

887
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,798
dashes for it.

888
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,510
They're obsessed about being closer!

889
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,472
But if you keep at it,

890
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,558
one day you wind up
in the front row,

891
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,832
and there you're too close
to see anything!

892
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,314
She's not even listening.

893
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,751
Yes, I am... best seats...
front row. Don't stop.

894
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,869
Be right there!

895
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,518
Sorry to have leave you,

896
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,076
but tonight the cops bust
a drunken mom in an ugly divorce.

897
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,397
Turns out she's not a drunk,
the dad's a pervert,

898
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,160
they're fighting over a kid,
and I have to solve it.

899
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,554
See ya!

900
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,475
Your mother arrived in a sled,

901
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,797
and she said to me:
"Why do you lie to everyone?"

902
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,558
"Your pretext:

903
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,994
"I'm selling,
because now I couldn't buy them...

904
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,472
"In fact,
you're selling out of pride.

905
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,154
"You want to hear
the stakes going up,

906
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,432
"each extra dollar
gets your rocks off.

907
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,108
"It's not the money, I know.

908
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,718
"It's pride.

909
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,956
"It means: I was right.

910
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,277
"I understood before any of you,

911
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,756
"that one day
this would be worth a fortune.

912
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,118
"And you lived for that day."

913
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,674
Was she right?

914
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,354
She wasn't wrong.

915
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,078
We've become friends.

916
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,790
She's great,
even better in real life.

917
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,910
You'll make it.
Don't worry, it'll be great!

918
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,877
No, it won't wear you out!

919
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,116
And I have another surprise for you.

920
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,788
Love you, Grandma. Big kiss!

921
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,717
Happy auction.
I hope you get your rocks off!

922
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,915
As to Valerie,

923
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,553
I'm guess she's allright.

924
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,110
Don't get carried away.

925
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,036
Why did you tell her
you were in London?

926
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,750
Let's have lunch, some day soon.

927
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,636
- Looks like you were in bed.
- Me?

928
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,073
- Just got off work?
- No, it's just that...

929
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,430
Once again, it's a long story...

930
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,035
Care for a drink?

931
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,239
But not in there.

932
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,954
Come along.

933
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,632
Where was your bedroom?

934
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,159
Over the garage.
There were lots of trucks.

935
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,400
The freight, the airline,
all that came later.

936
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,879
One day he broke his piggy bank
and bought his first twig.

937
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,069
First twig?

938
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,678
It's the story of 2 beavers.

939
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,869
A cartoon?

940
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,389
For grown-ups.

941
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,389
It took me a while to understand.

942
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,393
Strong stuff!

943
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,119
In your nightly wanderings,
have you found anything?

944
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,309
Found what?

945
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,794
What are you looking for?

946
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,348
The best seat in the house,
not too close or too far back.

947
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,396
Is there an empty seat beside it?

948
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,674
My back is stuck...

949
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,110
- It hurts, there!
- Wait, bend your legs.

950
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,389
Breathe deeply...

951
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,953
Keep on breathing.

952
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,238
- That feel better?
- A bit.

953
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,111
Again.

954
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,108
In little puffs.

955
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,796
It's gone.

956
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,274
See?

957
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,675
It's a lovely baby girl!

958
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,394
A window table? None, anywhere.

959
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,591
It's bedlam tonight! Sorry!

960
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,033
We won't manage!
They're all coming in at once.

961
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,228
Thank you!

962
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,792
They're lovely!

963
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,149
Some chocolates.

964
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,592
We've got work to do!

965
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,834
- Mr Lefort!
- I thought I'd drop by.

966
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,232
How sweet of you!

967
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,716
Catherine!

968
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,473
Here, a trifle.

969
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,638
- You know Jean-François Lefort?
- No... of course I do.

970
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,319
Delighted.

971
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,552
- We'd better move.
- Seen Valentine?

972
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,439
Thanks, dear.

973
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,431
I wanted to say...

974
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,791
I hope it goes fine tonight, and...

975
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,149
And?

976
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,634
That's all.
Enjoy your meal!

977
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,958
What a nerve!

978
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,148
Well...

979
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,238
I wanted to be a performer.

980
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,357
But I didn't have enough...

981
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,473
No talent at all.

982
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,275
So, I thought I'd spend my life
with performers.

983
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,755
And at that, I was a hit.

984
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,672
Thanks to them, and to you,
I've had a great life.

985
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,835
Thanks!

986
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,958
I'll miss you all!

987
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,633
Too bad she's leaving.

988
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,549
Don't cry.

989
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,312
I'm sweating, right?

990
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,556
You're fine. You'll be OK?

991
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,674
Ready?

992
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,796
I have the key, I'll lock up.

993
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,314
- Can I have a word with you?
- Can't it wait?

994
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,398
- But it's my last day...
- Your last day?

995
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,477
You said I was "on trial".
So I figured that...

996
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,956
What did you figure?
Hold it a second!

997
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,513
Please!

998
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,834
You figured what?
Must you bring it up now?

999
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,828
That even when you're being nice,
you're nasty!

1000
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,953
- I'm not, I'm doing my job.
- We're all doing that!

1001
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,639
We all have problems!

1002
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,876
You're no worse off than anyone.

1003
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,198
You're not even a pianist
or an actor or rich!

1004
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,356
Can't you be nice to me just once?

1005
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,198
Is there a Jessica here?

1006
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,478
It's this delightful young woman!

1007
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,113
A lady's waiting in my cab.

1008
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,716
Keep it short!

1009
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,311
My God!

1010
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,318
Watch out! You'll fall off!

1011
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,391
Wait!

1012
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,274
I don't believe it!

1013
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,033
Careful!

1014
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,273
You look wonderful!

1015
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,232
We sign tomorrow.

1016
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,359
They wanted 12 episodes.
I agreed to 6.

1017
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,549
She has stagefright.

1018
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,239
200,000!

1019
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,873
250,000 in the back on my right.

1020
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,314
It's 300,000 now!

1021
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,080
400,000 on the balcony.

1022
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,236
450,000 on my left.

1023
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,759
500,000 in the back.

1024
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,915
550,000.

1025
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,429
600,000, who bids higher?

1026
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,070
"Please, what came over you?"

1027
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,272
"No! Stop wandering around
in your nightgown!

1028
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,754
"Wearing that hat!"

1029
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,837
- "You don't like my hat?"
- "I do."

1030
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,632
- "No, you don't!"
- "Yes, I do."

1031
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,079
"No, you disapprove of my hat!"

1032
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,317
"My husband objects to my hat!"

1033
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,112
- "Not at all."
- "You do!"

1034
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,953
"I'm not against it."

1035
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:20,199
"Yes, you are! Say it,
and I'll take it off!"

1036
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,956
"There! Now, let's hear it!"

1037
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,233
"I don't give a fig about your hat.
So take it off!

1038
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,556
"But should a mother wander around

1039
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,716
"in a nightgown
in front of her son?"

1040
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,796
"A 12-year old boy!"

1041
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,070
- "No, 13!"
- "12!"

1042
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,350
"No, 13. 3 days ago."

1043
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,152
"2 or 3 days don't count!"

1044
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,679
"Nothing counts with you!"

1045
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,233
"Hat or no hat!

1046
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,318
"With or without your nightgown!"

1047
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,875
"You're amazing tonight, Clarisse!"

1048
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,308
500,000!

1049
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,636
600,000 on my left!

1050
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,435
700,000... 800,000 on the phone.
It's your bid.

1051
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,513
It's your bid.

1052
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,954
800,000 on my left by phone...

1053
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,195
Sold!

1054
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,673
"I've been stung by a wasp!"

1055
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:06,990
"Poor Madame!"

1056
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,156
"Because you wander around naked!"

1057
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,430
"He's delighted by it!

1058
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,756
"A wasp!
I hope it wasn't poisonous!"

1059
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,274
We move on to lot 28,

1060
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,314
a fine Modigliani that was exhibited

1061
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,078
and reproduced in the catalogue,

1062
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,395
and we start at...

1063
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,717
3,000,000 Euros...
3,200,000...

1064
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,354
3,200,000...
against the bid on my left,

1065
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,518
3,500,000 in the back,
it's your bid, madame...

1066
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,712
Now it's 3,500,000...
3,900,000...

1067
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,035
"Julien!"

1068
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,597
- "What?"
- "I beg you..."

1069
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,835
"Suck me!"

1070
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,235
"I mean really, Clarisse..."

1071
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,432
"Suck me! As you did
for Miss Dieumamour!"

1072
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,438
"But, Clarisse,
it was her neck! Not her...

1073
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,073
"It was a fly, not a wasp!"

1074
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,554
"Wasps can be deadly!

1075
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,911
"I saw in the paper,
a man died of a wasp sting!"

1076
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,437
"Victor, water the plants!"

1077
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,358
I'm so hot in here.

1078
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,350
Aren't you?

1079
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,669
I always found that
so uncomfortable!

1080
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,869
If you knew...

1081
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,788
I feel better now.

1082
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,876
But I'll play the finale for you.

1083
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,959
Can we go on?

1084
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,755
Two bars before S.

1085
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,471
Sold to the lady on the left
in the back.

1086
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,151
Next is lot 31,
Brancusi's "The Kiss", 1925,

1087
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,235
in brown stone,
the only one of its kind,

1088
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,717
a very rare piece.

1089
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,237
I'll start the bidding at...

1090
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,151
2,000,000 Euros.

1091
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,629
2,200000.

1092
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,674
2,400000...
2,600000...

1093
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,836
To the man standing at the back.

1094
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,720
2,800000 to you, madame.

1095
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,155
Now a bid on the phone
at 2, 900000.

1096
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,552
3,000000!

1097
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:38,072
To the man at the back...

1098
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,353
3,500,000 to the same bidder,

1099
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,235
3,500000 to the man at the back.

1100
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,193
Who'll bid more?

1101
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,595
3,700000 on the right.

1102
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,872
3,900000 in the back on the left.

1103
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,152
We're still at 3,900000
in the back...

1104
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,276
I'm sorry,
I've just been told that lot 31

1105
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,550
has been withdrawn...

1106
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,195
It's the seller's right

1107
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,709
if the hammer hasn't come down.

1108
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,718
Next is lot 32,
a fine work by Fernand Léger,

1109
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,152
a fine painting
that we'll start at 2,000000...

1110
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,273
Feel better?

1111
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,910
Catherine, fabulous!
Let me tell you...

1112
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,235
Shut up, witch!

1113
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,715
Save the poisoned apples
for Snow White!

1114
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,037
Mother, you made it! Come in!

1115
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,912
Be right back, girls...

1116
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,118
Darling, you were wonderful...

1117
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,072
In a moment!

1118
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,878
You're my Simone.

1119
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,195
Can I help you?

1120
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,435
Expecting someone?

1121
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,758
My granddaughter.
She works across the street.

1122
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,388
Is that Jessica?

1123
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,791
- She told me about you.
- Really?

1124
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,956
I work nearby, too.

1125
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,990
I'm a musician.

1126
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,553
You're a lucky man.

1127
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:01,831
This is for you.

1128
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,276
How sweet of you!

1129
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,955
Darling!

1130
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,469
- It's only for one night...
- Thank God!

1131
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,552
I know the prices!

1132
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,988
This isn't madapolam!

1133
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,313
It's crazy.

1134
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,919
Are you sure?

1135
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,189
I pre-paid.

1136
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,990
You'll have a rose with breakfast.
But no diamonds...

1137
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,478
Did I ever tell you

1138
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,874
how I started at the Ritz?

1139
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,274
No. Tell me tomorrow!

1140
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,794
You're not staying?

1141
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,913
I have a date.

1142
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,475
Come give me a kiss!

1143
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,789
You're my ray of sunshine.

1144
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,472
Your date is a lucky man.

1145
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,952
It's too simple.

1146
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,550
Declarations of war
and of love, all at once.

1147
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,869
It's too simple.

1148
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,070
As for your strip-tease
before an audience...

1149
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,750
Is it a love letter
or a farewell letter?

1150
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,873
Which do you prefer?

1151
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,432
I want us to be together.

1152
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,440
You're my wife, my soldier.

1153
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,308
My war isn't with you.

1154
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:56,153
But I warn you,
that lake house...

1155
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,749
How about a beach house?

1156
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,953
I'm cold.

1157
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,228
Come...

1158
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:09,829
let's go home.

1159
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,197
It was a lovely concert.

1160
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,834
You played the 2nd movement
beautifully...

1161
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,874
You have to take risks, Jessica.

1162
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,593
I pushed my way in.

1163
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,429
And you know, Jessica,
I had a wonderful life.

1164
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,432
<i>Madapolam: Coarse cotton fabrlc,
between calico and percale.</i>

1165
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,392
<i>Named afterthe city in India
where it was made.</i>
