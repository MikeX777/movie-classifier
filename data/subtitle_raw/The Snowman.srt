2
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:07,797
Mom! Mom!

3
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,766
Uncle Jonas is here.

4
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,868
No, it's not Tuesday today.

5
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,839
But he is. He's here.

6
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,591
So, after
the Germans surrendered,

7
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:39,731
when did our king return
to Norway from exile?

8
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,335
Mm...

9
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:49,275
June 7, 1945.

10
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:55,279
And on what date
did the Norwegian parliament

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,284
hold its first election
after the war?

12
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,186
Mm...

13
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,258
Um...

14
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,528
- July 6...
- Don't guess.

15
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,864
Uh...

16
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,468
August 3...

17
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,639
On what date
did the Norwegian parliament

18
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,612
hold its first election
since the war?

19
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,512
Mm...

20
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,746
August...

21
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,618
August 12, 1945.

22
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,492
You have to help him more.

23
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,673
I'm going to tell your wife
that he's your son.

24
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,612
And then she can tell
the rest of your family.

25
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,253
Then you'll never see me again.

26
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,665
Stop! Please!

27
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,302
Wait!

28
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,072
- No!
- Jonas!

29
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,006
No! Jonas!

30
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,008
No!

31
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,513
Jonas!

32
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,985
Mom!

33
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:03,802
Mom?

34
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,986
Mom, come on.

35
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:25,557
We gotta get out of here.

36
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,562
Mom, come on.

37
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,031
Open the door!

38
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,404
Mom, come on!

39
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,637
Open the door!

40
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,710
Mom!

41
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,513
Mom!

42
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,449
No!

43
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:53,586
Don't leave me!

44
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,924
No...!

45
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,949
Shit.

46
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,793
Morning.

47
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,906
Fuck it!

48
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,312
Piece of shit.

49
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,782
Harry Hole?

50
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,787
Hello.

51
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,823
Dry rot throughout
the whole building,

52
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,392
and I'm afraid we've found
some mold behind the walls.

53
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:00,829
Aspergillus,
toxic and pathogenic.

54
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,834
Yeah, your landlord let me in
to spray the apartment.

55
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,736
I'm gonna have to take
all these panels off.

56
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,071
And this is above your bed.
Jesus Christ.

57
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,940
Is there anywhere else
that you could stay?

58
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,377
The air in here is so bad,

59
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,716
you're actually killing
your house plants.

60
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,323
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

61
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,825
You are familiar
with Emanuel Vigeland?

62
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:32,896
The brothers' work
was most likely influenced

63
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,198
by their father,
who turned to drink,

64
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,371
had an illegitimate child
with a younger woman.

65
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,445
Yeah, that's...
yeah, that's a tragedy.

66
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,214
Yeah. I didn't know that
about his background.

67
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:55,251
You can clearly see
in each artist's case the...

68
00:10:55,253 --> 00:11:00,225
the recurring themes
of love perverted and betrayed.

69
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,892
<i>The good news is that</i>

70
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,329
<i>with this new version
of the EVISYNC,</i>

71
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,131
from version 3.6
to version 4.0,

72
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,968
allows you to manually push
the data back to the server

73
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,802
using the cellular network.

74
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:16,940
The EVISYNC will automatically
upload all the new data

75
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,945
to the central police server
here every 12 hours.

76
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,512
We've also done some work

77
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:26,049
on the fingerprint
scanning software.

78
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:29,319
So you will notice
a significantly faster

79
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,222
opening time after scanning
your fingerprint.

80
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,958
But please make sure
that your fingerprint scans

81
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,762
are done cleanly and clearly
from the start.

82
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:42,065
If you are experiencing
a high number of false scans,

83
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,099
this is probably because
your fingerprints

84
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:47,070
were scanned incorrectly
from the start.

85
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,803
That must be nearly
a whole week of mail this time.

86
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:23,908
Did I miss anything
while I was away?

87
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,846
My uncle died.

88
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,149
Close, were you?

89
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:32,982
A leave of absence has to be

90
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:36,084
formally requested...
in writing.

91
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:37,188
Doesn't matter who you are.

92
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,156
Backdate it,

93
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:43,394
but I can't keep covering
for you.

94
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:48,097
I'm dealing with it.

95
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,501
I need a case to work on.

96
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:55,274
I apologize for Oslo's
low murder rate.

97
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:01,346
Let's, um, stick
to the uncle story.

98
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,925
You scared my clients away.

99
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,426
I didn't forget
Oleg's birthday.

100
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,598
I got him concert tickets.

101
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:57,001
What did you do?

102
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,105
We took him for a pizza.

103
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,574
Oleg misses you.

104
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:09,177
He doesn't get along very well
with Mathias.

105
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:11,647
What about you?

106
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,151
I'm not going to answer that.

107
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,186
He wants to meet
his real father.

108
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,860
I don't think
he's ready for that.

109
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:38,576
Thank you
for walking me back home.

110
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:42,177
See you at the game.

111
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,180
Tell Oleg...

112
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,018
I'm sorry I missed it.

113
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,150
Hi.

114
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:35,554
The snowman.

115
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,554
Snowman!

116
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,259
I'll take a picture.

117
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,197
Oh, it's beautiful, honey.

118
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,270
Mom!

119
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,614
Yeah, hi.

120
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:38,381
Hello.

121
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,681
Can I borrow your scarf?

122
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,250
You want my scarf? Okay.

123
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:45,555
I told you I had
to leave by 8:00.

124
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,658
And I told you that I had
to help one of my students.

125
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,612
Go to sleep. Night-night.

126
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,009
No, thanks.

127
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,745
It's the smoking room.

128
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:52,748
Yeah, but it's the only place
I can concentrate, so...

129
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,684
I'm, um... I'm Katrine Bratt.

130
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,486
Harry Hole.

131
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,689
I know who you are.
We, um...

132
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,024
We actually studied
your cases at the academy.

133
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:05,393
I didn't know
they date back that far.

134
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,662
Yeah, you're up there
with the legends, so...

135
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,741
I don't know who you are.

136
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,344
No, I'm new.

137
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,315
I, um...
I transferred from Bergen.

138
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:27,318
Actually, they put me
in your office.

139
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,922
Okay.

140
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:36,794
Bye.

141
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,350
Mom?

142
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,465
Mommy?

143
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,979
Mommy?

144
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:57,072
Okay, where can I
drop you? I'm on a call.

145
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,107
It's okay. I'm in no hurry.

146
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,142
So, why don't you have a car?

147
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:02,913
I don't have a license.

148
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,518
Missing persons?

149
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,754
Yeah, it's a woman.

150
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,925
The, uh, call just came in.

151
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,132
So, this machine
is called an EVISYNC,

152
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,500
and I will record you,
so there's a little camera

153
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,736
- on the other side. We're aware of it.
- Right.

154
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:29,738
Would you like to walk me
through what happened?

155
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,142
W-Well, I saw Josephine
in the garden in her pajamas,

156
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:35,510
and, uh, I thought,

157
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,580
"What is she doing
out in this cold?"

158
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,949
So I came over to check.

159
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:44,586
And she said she couldn't
find her mother.

160
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,055
I tried calling the father,

161
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,527
but apparently he's away
on business.

162
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,213
How long has she been missing?

163
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,949
Two days.

164
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,785
She said she was going
to visit a friend,

165
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,490
and she never came back.

166
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,856
Why did you come to me?

167
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,959
I've been suspended.

168
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,260
'Cause you're a friend.

169
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:01,632
And you're a great detective.

170
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:06,134
And I don't want anyone knowing
about this just yet.

171
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:09,138
Not yet. I don't want
to go to the police.

172
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,640
Can you tell me...

173
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,809
well, was your wife
seeing anyone?

174
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:18,849
I, uh, checked
her credit card bills.

175
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,017
She's been to see
a pregnancy doctor.

176
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,958
Well, that...
that's great news, Frederick.

177
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,029
We haven't shared a bed
in three years.

178
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,678
This is Birte Becker.

179
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,349
Please leave a message.

180
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,888
This is Birte Becker.
Please leave a message.

181
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:34,759
This is Birte Becker.

182
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,744
Hello, Mr. Donkey.

183
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,851
Can I sit down?

184
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,692
It's a nice place
you've got here, Mr. Donkey.

185
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:14,833
Did you do this by yourself?

186
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,669
My mom helped me.

187
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:24,375
Was she in a good mood
when she got home?

188
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,678
Mm-hmm.

189
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,350
And what about your dad?

190
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:40,756
He was grumpy again
'cause Mommy was late.

191
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:43,761
Did she call
to say she'd be late?

192
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:50,101
My dad doesn't want me
to have a phone.

193
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,072
She didn't phone the house?

194
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,310
Is he grumpy often?

195
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,482
Has your mother
been upset lately

196
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:10,020
when your father's been grumpy?

197
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,761
Have you ever seen her cry?

198
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,796
No.

199
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,965
But I saw Daddy cry.

200
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,333
When?

201
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,301
A few nights ago.

202
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:27,706
He saw me, too.

203
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,440
What did he do?

204
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:34,776
Locked himself in the bathroom.

205
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:37,449
Where was Mommy
when he was crying?

206
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,517
She'd gone out.

207
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,952
Shit.

208
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,921
Yes. Is this Filip Becker?

209
00:28:46,923 --> 00:28:49,490
Okay, um, yeah, um, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

210
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:50,825
I better go.

211
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:51,930
Thank you.

212
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,099
He cried last week.

213
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:02,203
Why did you build the snowman
facing the house?

214
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:05,009
I didn't build the snowman.

215
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,982
<i>This is Birte Becker.</i>

216
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,754
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

217
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,357
<i>This is Birte Becker.</i>

218
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,828
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

219
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:48,083
You want a coffee
or something?

220
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,117
No.

221
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,289
Look, you're not gonna try
and sleep with me, are you?

222
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,390
No.

223
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:57,195
Okay, good.

224
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,130
She'll show up.

225
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:03,899
She's having an affair.

226
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,933
She left her coat
and her handbag in the house

227
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:07,568
and the front doors open.

228
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,071
Even if you're having
an affair,

229
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,907
you do not leave your child
like that.

230
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,242
And, Harry,
she's not the only one.

231
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:15,477
Look, this is Hege Dahl.

232
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,879
Missing two weeks.

233
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,313
Similar age, young children.

234
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,984
Unhappy marriage.

235
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,320
Talk to the husband.

236
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,226
<i>Uh, 411 to dispatch?</i>

237
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,960
Dispatch, do you receive?

238
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:07,328
Go ahead, 411.

239
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,230
We're up in Mount Ulriken.

240
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:10,932
It looks like a homicide.

241
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:13,035
Uh, adult female.
It's hard to see from here,

242
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,937
but, uh,
there's a lot of blood.

243
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,338
Uh, a group of schoolchildren
found her.

244
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,455
I've got a problem.
Rafto just showed up.

245
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,457
What the hell's he doing there?

246
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,025
He's been suspended.

247
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:39,161
Yeah, try telling him that.

248
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,664
Uh, we'll send the
kids down with their teacher.

249
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,499
Make sure there's a
care officer to meet them

250
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:48,205
and someone
to deal with the parents.

251
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,517
One of the children,
they heard a noise,

252
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,518
and they went
to see what, uh...

253
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,388
- what it was.
- Listen, listen, listen, John, John.

254
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,657
I'm gonna need you
to calm down. Calm down.

255
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,392
It's important
that you answer my questions...

256
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:12,361
- Who's in charge?
- Svenson.

257
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,595
Jesus.

258
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:17,032
Uh, it gets worse.

259
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,133
Rafto just arrived.

260
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,036
Perfect.
The drunk and the half-wit.

261
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:24,639
Just keep them apart, will you?

262
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,208
I'll see what I can do.

263
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,711
Whatever.

264
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,450
Where you going?

265
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,150
Rafto!

266
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,235
Rafto!

267
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,668
- We're closed.
- It's all right.

268
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,849
You have something of mine.

269
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,687
It's not yours.

270
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:49,257
Cold case.

271
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,792
I have clearance
to take it out.

272
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,561
You don't.

273
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,799
So, what,
you're going to report me?

274
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,635
Eli Kvale.

275
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:02,572
Tell me.

276
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,142
She was married.

277
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:09,411
She had three children.

278
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,813
The 12th of November,
six years ago,

279
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,249
she went missing.

280
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:17,155
And the day she vanished,
it was snowing.

281
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:23,224
Hege Dahl disappeared
the eighth of November.

282
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:26,293
The day she went missing,
it was snowing.

283
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:28,329
Not unusual. It's winter.

284
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,597
Now Birte Becker.

285
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,434
The night she disappeared...

286
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,603
- Snowing.
- Yeah.

287
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:38,440
I think it's the falling snow
that sets the killer off.

288
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:40,275
And furthermore,
they're all married,

289
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,612
they all have children.

290
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:47,581
Did you talk to Filip Becker?

291
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,251
Nine times out of ten,
the husband did it.

292
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:52,287
He was interviewed,
and his alibi is solid.

293
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,258
He was a hundred miles away.

294
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:58,459
Have you eaten?

295
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,195
No.

296
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,766
No, I haven't. I'm hungry.

297
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,708
28th, handball.

298
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,680
Josephine's handball match.

299
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,583
Third, "F. lunch."

300
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:26,188
That's lunch
with her friend Frida.

301
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,657
I really... I don't see
the point in doing this.

302
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,628
I won't keep you much longer.

303
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:35,229
Ninth, Vetlesen.

304
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:37,566
He's her doctor.
Tenth, yoga.

305
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,967
Do you have any idea
why your wife went to see him?

306
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,536
Who?

307
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,474
Dr. Vetlesen.

308
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,409
No.

309
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,709
Tenth, yoga.

310
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,579
Is there any reason
you can think of

311
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,352
why your wife
might disappear so suddenly?

312
00:35:57,554 --> 00:36:00,222
Your marriage...

313
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,527
was everything all right?

314
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:08,963
Were either of you
having an affair?

315
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,233
Daddy!

316
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,666
Come on!

317
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,568
I promised her we'd walk
around the neighborhood

318
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,371
to see if we could find
her mother.

319
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:18,773
I'm just gonna get my jacket,
darling!

320
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:20,675
Come out!

321
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,276
Dad!

322
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,521
Step inside.

323
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:22,839
Mm. I thought
you wouldn't remember.

324
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:31,479
Is he still
giving you a hard time?

325
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:33,081
If you want, I can talk to him.

326
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,519
Oh!

327
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,988
Just have fun tonight.

328
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,358
He misses you.

329
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,726
Hi, Harry.

330
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,264
Good to see you.

331
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,032
Sorry I'm late, honey.

332
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,900
Have you had anything to eat?

333
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,070
No, I'll-I'll grab
something later.

334
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,505
No, no, no, I've got vouchers.

335
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:59,541
- Yeah?
- Yep.

336
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,575
Hot dog or hot dog.

337
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:03,614
Well, hot dog, then.

338
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,347
Harry?

339
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,019
I'll get something to eat
with Oleg after.

340
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:21,996
So, how are things with you?

341
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,831
- All right.
- Yeah?

342
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,766
Bit tired.

343
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:28,471
You've been working too hard,
haven't you?

344
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:32,042
I can't sleep.

345
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,945
You should try Valzetet.

346
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,613
It's a new one.

347
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:40,951
It'll help you sleep.

348
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:45,153
I can give you
a prescription right now.

349
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,755
- Really?
- Yeah.

350
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,155
With that?

351
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:49,824
Yeah.

352
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:04,972
She won't allow me
to try and find my father.

353
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,444
Your mother
should be the judge of that.

354
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,746
She won't listen to me.

355
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:14,584
She's worried about you.

356
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,552
All she cares about is herself.

357
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:20,155
All she cares about is you.

358
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,624
That's why she dumped me.

359
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,793
I'm such a bad influence.

360
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,461
She's concerned.

361
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:30,465
Concerned about what?

362
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,603
The fact that you run away
from home.

363
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,037
The fact
that you've been drinking.

364
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,612
So you're gonna give me
a lecture about drinking?

365
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,481
Don't be a prick.

366
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,882
Your mum told me
the school's arranged

367
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:50,050
a father-and-son camping trip.

368
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:52,487
If you want, I can come.

369
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:56,126
But you're not
her boyfriend anymore.

370
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,459
So?

371
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,498
Yeah.

372
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,599
Yeah.

373
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:06,737
I want you to come.

374
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:11,742
- You sure?
- Yeah.

375
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,541
Good.

376
00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:18,679
So, what's the...
the big surprise?

377
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:19,716
Uh...

378
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,650
Let's find out.

379
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,820
Someone at work
got me the tickets.

380
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,666
You got a message.

381
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,538
Let me see what it says.

382
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,974
I gotta make a call.

383
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,642
You stay here?

384
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,545
Harry, there's another

385
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:51,945
missing woman...
in Geilo this time.

386
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:53,947
That's not our jurisdiction.

387
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,849
I think we should have
a look at this.

388
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:57,985
I'm going to be with you
in two minutes, okay?

389
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:00,657
Her husband specifically
asked for you.

390
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,097
- Hello.
- Hi.

391
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,900
Oh, I didn't expect you
so early.

392
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,836
- Something came up.
- Oh.

393
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,537
Hi, Harry.

394
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:17,740
- Hi.
- How was the concert?

395
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:22,545
Yeah, it was... it was great.

396
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,115
We spoke.

397
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,786
I'm taking him on the
father-and-son camping trip...

398
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:33,755
thing.

399
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,956
Uh...

400
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,659
See you.

401
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,063
- Hey.
- Bye.

402
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,633
Take me home.

403
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,903
We'll go in the morning.

404
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:31,813
<i>Who reported her missing?</i>

405
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,180
<i>Her husband last night.</i>

406
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:35,316
<i>20:05.</i>

407
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,019
<i>Sylvia Ottersen, 33 years old.</i>

408
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:42,990
<i>Self-employed, married twice.</i>

409
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:44,825
<i>But no children.</i>

410
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,713
Hello?

411
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,050
Hello!

412
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:11,786
Hello?

413
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,054
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,688
Can I help you?

415
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,326
Yeah, well,
we're with the Oslo Police.

416
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:55,396
We got the
missing persons call.

417
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,768
Oh. Who's missing?

418
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,934
Sylvia Ottersen.

419
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:02,970
I'm Sylvia Ottersen.

420
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,706
What, you're Sylvia Ottersen?

421
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,177
Why... why would your husband
report you missing?

422
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,778
I have no idea.

423
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,213
He's not the kind
to play practical jokes.

424
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:15,749
- Is he here?
- No.

425
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:18,286
He's gone to the station
to pick up my sister.

426
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,787
Okay.

427
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:22,255
Well, I guess it must be
a crank call.

428
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:23,858
We didn't know where you were,

429
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,427
so we had a look
inside the house.

430
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,396
I turned your music off.

431
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:30,067
Sorry about that.

432
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,670
Thank you.

433
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,208
Can I just ask you...
is it just

434
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,112
you and your husband,
or do you have any children?

435
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,182
No, it's just us.

436
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:50,253
Okay. Thank you.

437
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
<i>What the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

438
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:10,771
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

439
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:13,775
Calling the police,
telling them I'm missing.

440
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,209
You think that's funny?

441
00:45:16,211 --> 00:45:18,211
Don't you understand?
It's over.

442
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:20,116
I don't want to see you again.

443
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:23,316
No, it wasn't your child.

444
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:25,552
It was mine.

445
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:28,891
If you call one more time,
I'm going to the police.

446
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,932
<i>HQ to DC Bratt.</i>

447
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,499
<i>DC Bratt?</i>

448
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:48,235
<i>Yeah, speaking.</i>

449
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:49,970
<i>We've had
a missing persons report.</i>

450
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:52,072
<i>A woman named Sylvia Ottersen.</i>

451
00:46:52,074 --> 00:46:55,342
<i>Oh, no, she's fine.
We-we just left her.</i>

452
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:59,179
<i>Well, the call
came in two minutes ago.</i>

453
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:02,083
<i>Her husband asked specifically
for Inspector Hole.</i>

454
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,619
<i>How could...</i>

455
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,423
<i>Turn the car around.</i>

456
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,042
Sylvia?

457
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,476
Sorry we're back,
Mrs. Ottersen.

458
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:32,079
We just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

459
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,148
I'm Ann Pedersen.

460
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,284
Sylvia's my sister.

461
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,286
We're twins.

462
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,556
Who are you?

463
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:19,387
- Is that enough?
- Yeah, keep going.

464
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,155
Did you find Hagen?

465
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:23,523
He's at the dinner
at City Hall.

466
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,428
Let's keep it clear,
if you can.

467
00:49:41,643 --> 00:49:43,312
<i>She was a free spirit.</i>

468
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:49,119
And she always liked men.

469
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:52,255
Ever since we were teenagers.

470
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,193
She was a good person.

471
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,827
She didn't want to hurt anyone.

472
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:03,333
It's just the way she was.

473
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:12,472
I know your sister
didn't have any children.

474
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:14,108
It was just that there
was something

475
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,608
in her reaction
that when I asked...

476
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,646
She was pregnant.

477
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,387
She wasn't sure
who the father was.

478
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,027
She got rid of the baby
a few weeks ago.

479
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:01,222
This way, please.

480
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,389
Thank you very much.
That's it.

481
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:19,673
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:21,508
introducing our guest of honor,

483
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,144
king of industry,
philanthropist,

484
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:26,880
and head of Oslo's
Winter Games bid,

485
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:29,483
Arve Stop.

486
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,818
So lovely of you
to be here for us.

487
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,521
I'm not on the list, but I know
many of these people.

488
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:34,521
I'm supposed to be on the list.

489
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:38,258
I'm a close, old friend
of Arve Stop's, you see.

490
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,193
- There's been some kind of misunderstanding.
- I have a...

491
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:41,327
- a person named Vetlesen.
- Come on up.

492
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:42,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you can come here.

493
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:45,231
He says he's
a friend of Arve Stop.

494
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:47,700
- No. Wait, wait.
- No, it's fine, it's fine.

495
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:49,639
No, just relax, just relax.

496
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:54,474
I run over a dozen companies.

497
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,242
When people ask me why

498
00:51:56,244 --> 00:51:59,679
I've given up so much
of my time to lead this bid,

499
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:03,450
I tell them it's because I
never had these opportunities.

500
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:07,521
When I was a boy, the only
winter sports I engaged in

501
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:09,657
were the uphill snow shovel

502
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,258
and the 50-meter
firewood carry.

503
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:20,367
That is why I believe
passionately that this Cup

504
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:24,441
is about much more than just
publicity for our fair city.

505
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:35,615
Homicides?

506
00:52:35,617 --> 00:52:37,251
Just missing persons for now,

507
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,851
but the pattern is disturbing.

508
00:52:38,853 --> 00:52:40,787
And...

509
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,425
I received this.

510
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:48,697
Prints?

511
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:51,565
It isn't just the letter.

512
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:54,001
He reported her missing
before he killed her.

513
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,273
He was watching us
the entire time.

514
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:00,773
What do you need?

515
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:02,508
Small team.

516
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,445
I'll set up a separate
incident room at the mill.

517
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,646
All right, but I don't want
a word of this to be leaked...

518
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:08,782
- To the press.
- Press, yeah.

519
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:11,387
Not until this fucking bid
is over.

520
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,531
Does this strike you as the
proper time and place for this?

521
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,401
Wait.

522
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:22,822
Idiot.

523
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,590
What?

524
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:26,392
Arve?

525
00:54:26,394 --> 00:54:28,628
What? No, don't cry.

526
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,033
Listen, what...

527
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:39,776
Shit.

528
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:00,563
Hey.

529
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:02,899
Hey!

530
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:10,773
Get out.

531
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,509
Get out!

532
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:31,460
Hey.

533
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,862
Oi, mate!

534
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,998
Annette Elden, 33,

535
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,101
disappeared
12th of December, 2006.

536
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:43,737
Her head washed ashore
near Arendal.

537
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:46,472
Rest of the body never found.

538
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:50,043
Forensic reports indicate
saw marks on her neck.

539
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:53,012
Status: unmarried.

540
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:55,983
Two children
by different fathers.

541
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,084
Harry, I got the names
and the addresses

542
00:55:58,086 --> 00:55:59,753
of Sylvia Ottersen's
boyfriends.

543
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:02,488
Now, she went to the clinic
the second of November,

544
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,425
but they won't break
patient confidentiality.

545
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:09,398
They do, however,
perform abortions.

546
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:16,003
What is it?

547
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,838
Magnus, get me the list.

548
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,039
What list?

549
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:21,575
The list of doctors
at the Gellion.

550
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:23,911
I'm thinking
that he's going after women

551
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,646
- that he disapproves of.
- Here you go.

552
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,585
All the doctors at Gellion
from the last five years.

553
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,586
How did he know?

554
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:34,858
How did he know
Sylvia Ottersen was pregnant?

555
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:42,899
Idar Vetlesen.

556
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,569
Birte Becker had an appointment
with the same doctor.

557
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,025
Dr. Idar Vetlesen?

558
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:15,061
Yes, that's me.

559
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:16,662
Step in.

560
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:17,998
Birte Becker
and Sylvia Ottersen

561
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,733
were both patients of yours?

562
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:22,536
Uh, no. Uh, they were both
patients at the clinic.

563
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,137
Uh, I never met
Sylvia Ottersen.

564
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:27,074
Can you tell me
who treated her?

565
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:30,510
No, I am bound
by patient confidentiality.

566
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:32,579
She's dead.

567
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:34,180
Oh.

568
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:35,849
Oh, no.

569
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:37,251
Right.

570
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,786
Well, doctor confidentiality.

571
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:41,054
In theory, would it be possible

572
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:42,655
for you to access
her medical files?

573
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:43,891
Even if you didn't
treat her yourself.

574
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,858
Well, in theory, yes.

575
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,827
The doctors at the clinic
have access

576
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:49,229
to the files of every patient,

577
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:51,097
should they choose
to look at them.

578
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:53,166
Which I did not.

579
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:55,202
What did you see
Birte Becker about?

580
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:57,737
Well, that is,
uh, confidential.

581
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:59,908
How do you know Arve Stop?

582
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:02,809
- Arve?
- Hmm?

583
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,948
Well, I've known Arve
for years.

584
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:08,749
I do research
in premature birth.

585
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,918
We have a small charity,
and Arve Stop is one of

586
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,686
- our biggest supporters.
- Huh, I wouldn't have thought

587
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:15,923
that a man who goes on so much
about family values

588
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,559
would support a clinic
that specializes in abortion.

589
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,961
Well, we specialize
in many different areas.

590
00:58:21,963 --> 00:58:23,764
- Hmm.
- And Mr. Stop

591
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,099
supports our research
in premature birth.

592
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,601
So, do you see each other
socially?

593
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:31,170
Well, yeah, well,
that depends on how you mean.

594
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,673
It's quite simple, actually.
Do you have friends in common?

595
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:36,175
Yes, we-we mix
in the same circles, so...

596
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,579
- Why-why are you, uh...
- To know if you...

597
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:39,746
Have you ever practiced
in other parts

598
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:40,914
of the country, Dr. Vetlesen?

599
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,648
Yes, I have.

600
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,751
In, uh... in Eidsvoll,
in, uh, Lillehammer.

601
00:58:44,753 --> 00:58:46,954
I see you have a picture
of Mon Plaisir pavilion

602
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,025
- in Bergen.
- Yes, yes. In Bergen.

603
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,994
Do you live alone?

604
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,929
Yes, I, uh...
I am a reluctant bachelor.

605
00:58:56,931 --> 00:59:00,099
Is there anyone
in the house right now?

606
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:03,772
Because I thought I saw someone
in the window when I passed.

607
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:07,307
Right, well, if you want
to take a look around,

608
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,775
I will need to see
a search warrant.

609
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:14,347
In fact, if you don't mind,
I would like to call my lawyer

610
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:17,016
before I answer any more
of your questions.

611
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:20,119
That won't be necessary,
Dr. Vetlesen.

612
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:23,592
You can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time.

613
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,999
- Hey.
- Hey.

614
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:32,168
What was that?

615
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:36,168
- What?
- He isn't a suspect yet.

616
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,271
We need his permission
to search the house.

617
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:39,972
I know that.

618
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:42,644
Why'd you ask him
about Arve Stop?

619
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:46,947
I saw a picture
of them both together.

620
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:48,949
And?

621
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,784
And it was
an innocent question.

622
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,086
Jesus, anyone can see
he's trying to hide something.

623
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:54,755
Why...

624
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:00,597
Oh, hey.

625
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:14,810
Cloudberry.

626
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:19,412
If you hadn't told me
to look out for it,

627
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:20,813
I'd have assumed
she was attached

628
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,014
to his security detail.

629
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:23,215
Cloudberry?

630
01:00:23,217 --> 01:00:25,053
It's her password.

631
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:28,921
Does this strike you

632
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:31,226
as the proper time
and place for this?

633
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:38,898
- Arve Stop.
- Idiot.

634
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,202
She filmed him at rallies,

635
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:45,274
at restaurants, at home.

636
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:06,094
Hi.

637
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,897
Do you want a ride?

638
01:01:10,498 --> 01:01:12,100
No.

639
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,245
Bye.

640
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:23,202
The 8:45 train to Bergen

641
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:25,007
is leaving from platform five.

642
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,244
Oh, sorry.

643
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:33,045
This is the 8:45 service

644
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:37,851
to Bergen, stopping at Gol,
Finse, Voss and Bergen.

645
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,356
The next station is Gol.

646
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:00,777
Hi, Harry.

647
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,476
Hi.

648
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:06,213
Hiding in the playroom, are we?

649
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,847
Yes.

650
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:09,849
Don't worry.

651
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:11,953
I-I'm getting off
at the next stop.

652
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:14,454
Going far?

653
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:15,856
Bergen.

654
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,958
Ah, rather you than me.

655
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,994
Then again, I am attending
a three-day conference

656
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:23,630
on bioidentical
hormone restoration.

657
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:26,532
I thought you were
a plastic surgeon.

658
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,869
Well, you know,
cosmetic surgery

659
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,871
needs to move
with the times, too.

660
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:36,208
We're swapping the scalpel for
hormone replacement therapy.

661
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,311
If you can slow down
the aging process,

662
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:42,182
there won't be any need
for face-lifts, will there?

663
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:44,487
I'll bear that in mind.

664
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:48,223
So, how is the prescription
working?

665
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:51,258
Sleeping like a baby.

666
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,528
Splendid.

667
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,967
So, you...
you canceled the Oleg thing.

668
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:02,401
The school trip.

669
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,271
Weren't you supposed to...

670
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,375
Oh, shit.

671
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:10,242
- Shit.
- I'm-I'm sorry, Harry.

672
01:04:10,244 --> 01:04:12,244
- Uh, I'm sure he's fine.
- Oleg, you coming?

673
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:15,548
- He-he knows how busy you are.
- Come on.

674
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,583
Shit.

675
01:04:17,585 --> 01:04:21,189
Look, look, you're-you're not
his father, Harry.

676
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,592
- What does that mean?
- Well, uh...

677
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:27,927
I don't have to be his father
to care about him.

678
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:29,329
I was trying to say that...

679
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:30,930
it's a big enough
responsibility

680
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:33,266
for a real father, isn't it?

681
01:04:33,268 --> 01:04:34,971
Let alone you and me.

682
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,442
- Sorry, Harry.
- No.

683
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,947
Did you hear from him?

684
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:49,983
Why can't I go?

685
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:51,954
- Can I go with you?
- Just go!

686
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,724
Hi, Oleg. It's Mathias.

687
01:04:57,726 --> 01:04:59,291
You know what?

688
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:01,260
Uh, I forgot to check
my messages last night,

689
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:03,128
and, uh, Harry called to say

690
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,597
that he couldn't make
your trip.

691
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,200
No, I know.

692
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:10,537
No, well, he-he couldn't get
through to you

693
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,206
or your mom, apparently,
so I...

694
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,108
No, it-it's totally
my fault, Oleg.

695
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:19,045
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

696
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:21,182
I'm sorry, Oleg. Yes.

697
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:23,650
Yeah.

698
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:26,251
So, see... see you
in a few days, then,

699
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:29,125
wh-when I'm back
from the conference. Yeah.

700
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:34,663
You didn't have to do that.

701
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:21,307
Ready? That's it!

702
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:23,175
Stop!

703
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,647
Hey, Aasen, someone here
to speak to you.

704
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:32,020
Aasen.

705
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,525
My family owned all
of these buildings.

706
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:41,693
And that house over there, too.

707
01:06:41,695 --> 01:06:44,097
Arve Stop worked
for us back then.

708
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,101
He was, uh, bright, ambitious.

709
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,773
My father really
believed in him.

710
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:54,307
The business
wasn't going very well,

711
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,575
so we, uh, offered him a stake.

712
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:59,813
Within a year,
he had forced us out.

713
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,351
Sold the land for a fortune.

714
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:08,220
Have any of my colleagues been
in touch with you recently?

715
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:09,789
A young lady?

716
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,291
No.

717
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,626
I look at this picture now,

718
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:17,333
I see Laila staring at him.

719
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,802
No idea at the time.

720
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,040
Family man, eh?

721
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:31,177
Do you remember the name
of your wife's doctor?

722
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:32,412
Sure.

723
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:33,582
Uh, Morton Freiberg.

724
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:42,222
Did she ever see someone
called Vetlesen?

725
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,557
Vetlesen? No.

726
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,195
Dr. Idar Vetlesen.

727
01:07:49,764 --> 01:07:51,367
No.

728
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:54,467
Any idea where I might find

729
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:56,802
the officer who was
in charge of the case?

730
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:58,339
Rafto?

731
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:02,474
He-he died.

732
01:08:02,476 --> 01:08:07,482
Yeah, he-he died
around the same time.

733
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:54,861
Detective Rafto.

734
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:57,563
Can you connect me
to Haukeland Hospital?

735
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:00,433
What is this?
Am I under arrest?

736
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,468
- A cake!
- Yeah.

737
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,903
I need some information
on a patient.

738
01:09:04,905 --> 01:09:06,839
Laila Aasen.

739
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:09,275
No, I don't... Listen to me.

740
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:10,576
I don't know
the admitting doctor.

741
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,544

for an abortion?

I heard he was
a great detective.

760
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:02,829
He was a suicidal maniac.

761
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,763
They were gonna
suspend him anyway.

762
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,531
They found stuff
in his drawers.

763
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:09,602
Items he'd stolen
from various crime scenes.

764
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:11,707
Is this him?

765
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,477
Where'd you get this?

766
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:18,814
From a colleague.

767
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,351
Yes, that's him.

768
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:26,052
He had this cabin
up on the coast.

769
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,655
Used to go up there
to get smashed.

770
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,726
He was probably drunk
when he shot himself.

771
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,831
What's this on the floor?

772
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:40,299
They look like coffee beans.

773
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:42,402
Maybe he was trying
to sober up after all.

774
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,438
You didn't check?

775
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,642
The cabin was locked
from the inside,

776
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:52,010
and he looked like that
when they found him.

777
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:54,449
There wasn't anything to check.

778
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:58,985
Did he have any family?

779
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:01,653
Wife who left him a year
before he killed himself.

780
01:11:01,655 --> 01:11:04,292
Um, I think there was
a daughter.

781
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,893
Do you know where she is now?

782
01:11:07,895 --> 01:11:10,095
Not a clue.

783
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:12,434
Is the cabin still there?

784
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:21,773
What are you doing
with my fucking gun, you idiot?

785
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,639
- Here's the papers you asked for.
- Hey.

786
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,490
Where's Harry?

787
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,025
In Bergen.

788
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:30,803
- Hello?
- Mr. Hole?

789
01:13:30,805 --> 01:13:32,804
This is Harry Hole's phone.

790
01:13:32,806 --> 01:13:35,007
Can I speak to him?

791
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:36,241
He's not here right now,

792
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:37,943
but I can take
the message for him.

793
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,144
Right, okay.

794
01:13:39,146 --> 01:13:41,546
Uh, this is Rebecca,
NRS at Telenor.

795
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:43,915
We picked up a signal
from a missing person's phone,

796
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:45,617
case number MP2.

797
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,153
Uh, um, I don't have
any files in front of me.

798
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:49,754
Um, who's that?

799
01:13:49,756 --> 01:13:51,022
I'll check.

800
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:52,193
Birte Becker.

801
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:55,628
What, it...

802
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,162
- Is it transmitting now?
- Yeah.

803
01:13:57,164 --> 01:13:59,065
Just got it in minutes ago.

804
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,166
Yeah, but wait, wait. Is it...
is it moving right now?

805
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:03,635
No. I'll send you
the coordinates.

806
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:04,870
No, just...
Wh-What's the address?

807
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:09,909
Uh, Parkway 1, 0139 Oslo.

808
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,178
You're sure that's correct?

809
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,516
Yes, Parkway 1.

810
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,521
Hey, are you all right?

811
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,182
This is Birte Becker.

812
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,953
Please leave a message.

813
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:22,934
Wednesday, unless you...

814
01:17:22,936 --> 01:17:24,736
Yes?

815
01:17:27,908 --> 01:17:29,810
- In his own garage?
- Yeah.

816
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,903
Ah, the great Harry Hole.

817
01:17:57,104 --> 01:17:58,838
How many bodies?

818
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,107
Birte Becker and Ms. Dahl.

819
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,442
- Where's Katrine?
- Suspended.

820
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:06,077
She got a call telling her
they traced the Becker phone

821
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,912
and didn't think
to tell anyone.

822
01:18:07,914 --> 01:18:09,882
I asked you where she was.

823
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:12,785
That's not my problem
right now.

824
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:15,787
He shot himself straight on.

825
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:18,057
How do you do that
with a shotgun?

826
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:21,259
It's too long.
You'd have to angle it.

827
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,763
Pellet marks should be
up there somewhere.

828
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,002
Luckily, we have experts
to determine that.

829
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,870
You sure he was alone?

830
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,403
The garage door was closed.

831
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:33,805
One set of footprints.

832
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:35,941
We found two bodies
in the house

833
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:37,945
and Birte Becker's phone.

834
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,813
It was a suicide.

835
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:43,719
Case closed.

836
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,321
<i>Mathias, listen.</i>

837
01:18:50,323 --> 01:18:53,491
I have no idea where he's gone.

838
01:18:53,493 --> 01:18:56,394
Yes, I've checked my messages.
He hasn't called.

839
01:18:56,396 --> 01:18:59,130
Oh, well, how can you help?

840
01:18:59,132 --> 01:19:01,103
You're at your
bloody conference!

841
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,306
Can I keep this?

842
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:06,875
No.

843
01:19:08,943 --> 01:19:10,878
Can I keep this?

844
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:15,216
Yeah, sure.

845
01:19:21,354 --> 01:19:22,456
She's not picking up.

846
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,900
Katrine!

847
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,419
Get off!

848
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,124
Stop.

849
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:09,069
I guess congratulations
are in order.

850
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:13,205
You know it wasn't that creep.

851
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:16,075
Vetlesen didn't commit suicide.

852
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:19,014
Someone killed him
because we got too close.

853
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:28,122
Like your father.

854
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:32,625
My father would never
have committed suicide.

855
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,160
He would never
have left me like that.

856
01:20:35,162 --> 01:20:36,562
Get off me.

857
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:38,062
Get off me. Get off me!

858
01:20:38,064 --> 01:20:39,430
Get off me!

859
01:20:39,432 --> 01:20:42,433
Get off me, you fucking drunk!

860
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:44,035
Get off.

861
01:20:44,037 --> 01:20:46,138
Get off.

862
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,475
Yeah.

863
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:51,212
I'm a drunk.

864
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:56,985
Like your father.

865
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:15,500
Laila Aasen and Arve Stop
were having an affair,

866
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:18,003
and that's the last thing
my father was investigating

867
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:19,407
before he got killed.

868
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:23,942
You broke into Vetlesen's house

869
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:26,178
because you were afraid
I'd find out this was personal

870
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,478
and take you off the case.

871
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,481
Vetlesen was his pimp.

872
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:31,683
And they were both in Bergen
when the murders started.

873
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:33,419
I know how much you want this,

874
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,553
but you can't force
the pieces to fit.

875
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:37,555
I called the Gellion Clinic,

876
01:21:37,557 --> 01:21:39,124
and Vetlesen
wasn't even working

877
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:41,492
the day he was supposed
to meet Birte Becker.

878
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:43,428
They found two dead bodies
in his house

879
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:44,662
and Birte Becker's phone.

880
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,298
Well, isn't that
convenient, then?

881
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,300
So Hagen has his killer
and Arve Stop's safe,

882
01:21:49,302 --> 01:21:51,570
and no questions are asked.

883
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:54,305
Do you actually think
he killed them?

884
01:21:54,307 --> 01:21:56,607
I don't know.

885
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:59,546
I don't think
either of us do for sure.

886
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:06,988
Maybe this will bring
your balls back.

887
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,474
I'm gonna need your weapon.

888
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:32,212
It's right there
in front of you.

889
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,730
Why did he call you Cloudberry?

890
01:22:54,568 --> 01:22:56,567
Because I liked

891
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:59,306
cloudberry jam with ice cream.

892
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,770
Oleg ran away again.

893
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:54,152
It doesn't really matter

894
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:57,356
if we win or lose
this bid tonight.

895
01:24:57,358 --> 01:24:59,525
What matters most
is that we celebrate

896
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,660
the way this has
brought us together,

897
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:04,162
and use that energy
to restore the values

898
01:25:04,164 --> 01:25:05,930
that make Norway great.

899
01:25:05,932 --> 01:25:08,599
And so it doesn't matter
if, uh,

900
01:25:08,601 --> 01:25:11,736
56 minutes and 33 seconds from
now... but who's counting...

901
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:15,907
...if the World Cup
goes to Beijing

902
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,576
or Denver or Montreal.

903
01:25:18,578 --> 01:25:22,513
Because I believe in my heart,
tonight,

904
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:24,750
Oslo has already won.

905
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:30,688
I tried calling.

906
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:33,491
I thought he might be with you.

907
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:35,294
- Oh.
- He's okay.

908
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,530
He's, uh...
he's at a friend's house.

909
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:41,633
Just didn't bother calling me.

910
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:43,637
What did you argue about?

911
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:47,809
Um, he doesn't want
to leave the city.

912
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:53,678
I thought that change
would be good for him.

913
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,916
Well, for me, too.

914
01:25:57,984 --> 01:25:59,884
Where?

915
01:25:59,886 --> 01:26:04,388
Um, Mathias has a house,
uh, up in Telemark.

916
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,425
And because he consults
all over the place, uh,

917
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:10,528
it's not too inconvenient.

918
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,964
I saw him the other day.

919
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,469
He didn't mention anything.

920
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:19,474
Is that really what you want?

921
01:26:20,908 --> 01:26:23,211
I don't know what I want.

922
01:26:29,582 --> 01:26:31,853
I miss you.

923
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,458
<i>In my head, I know it's 50-50,</i>

924
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,791
<i>but in my heart 100%.</i>

925
01:26:40,793 --> 01:26:42,693
- Thank you for coming.
- Mr. Stop?

926
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:45,630
Mr. Stop, I'm sorry.
I, um...

927
01:26:45,632 --> 01:26:47,732
I just want to thank you.

928
01:26:47,734 --> 01:26:49,768
I really liked your speech.

929
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,740
I found it very, very moving.

930
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,540
Well, you see, I, um...

931
01:26:56,542 --> 01:27:00,646
I was an orphan myself, so...

932
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:04,583
Well, it doesn't have to be
a disadvantage, young lady.

933
01:27:04,585 --> 01:27:06,320
It can motivate us, too.

934
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,521
Oh.

935
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:11,659
Well, yes.

936
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:14,992
I work in Bergen with...

937
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:17,728
with young people
in a care center, and I know

938
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,031
how... how very busy you are,

939
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:20,565
but if you're ever
in the city...

940
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:22,636
I started my career in Bergen.

941
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:25,670
Write to me.

942
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:27,873
- I'll see what I can do.
- Yes. I'm so sorry. I know...

943
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,840
I know people are waiting
to talk to you. Thank you.

944
01:27:29,842 --> 01:27:31,476
- Not at all.
- Oh.

945
01:27:43,724 --> 01:27:45,790
Mr. Stop wanted me
to let you know

946
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,025
how much he enjoyed
your conversation.

947
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:48,360
- Oh.
- It's, um...

948
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:50,297
It's room 472.

949
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:53,865
He'll be free
after the announcement,

950
01:27:53,867 --> 01:27:56,867
if there's anything else
you'd like to ask him.

951
01:27:56,869 --> 01:27:58,405
Thank you.

952
01:29:55,122 --> 01:29:56,987
Mathias.

953
01:29:56,989 --> 01:29:58,190
Where are you?

954
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,661
I just tried calling you
on the landline.

955
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:04,795
I'm at Harry's.

956
01:30:04,797 --> 01:30:05,964
Yeah?

957
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:08,200
Because I phoned
Eric's parents,

958
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,067
and Oleg wasn't there,
either, so I fig...

959
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:11,602
No, no, I found him.

960
01:30:11,604 --> 01:30:15,009
He was with another friend.

961
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:18,843
Are you okay?

962
01:30:18,845 --> 01:30:21,812
Yes, I-I'm fine now.

963
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:25,951
Mathias...

964
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:27,619
Uh, I've got to run, uh,

965
01:30:27,621 --> 01:30:29,620
to one of those
boring dinners, but...

966
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:31,857
I'll call you in the morning
when I'm back.

967
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,528
Okay?

968
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:45,072
Shit.

969
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:37,254
You couldn't have asked
another doctor?

970
01:31:37,256 --> 01:31:39,025
What?

971
01:31:45,565 --> 01:31:47,232
Two minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

972
01:32:25,137 --> 01:32:26,670
Hello?

973
01:32:28,975 --> 01:32:30,143
Hello?

974
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:40,184
And to all our viewers
around the world, thank you

975
01:32:40,186 --> 01:32:44,254
for joining us here tonight
at the hotel...

976
01:32:44,256 --> 01:32:46,257
No! No!

977
01:32:46,259 --> 01:32:48,660
Stop! No!

978
01:32:51,398 --> 01:32:54,965
...of Beijing, Denver, Oslo
and Montreal.

979
01:32:54,967 --> 01:32:57,070
No!

980
01:33:00,907 --> 01:33:02,941
...there can only be
one winner.

981
01:33:09,349 --> 01:33:10,815
...that the 15th

982
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:12,384
Winter Sports World Cup...

983
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:14,184
has been awarded to...

984
01:33:14,186 --> 01:33:15,919
Two, one...

985
01:33:15,921 --> 01:33:18,156
Oslo.

986
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:51,089
Thank you.

987
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:53,060
Congrats to us all.

988
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:10,645
Woo-hoo.

989
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:55,979
That's the last of her files
to download.

990
01:35:55,981 --> 01:35:57,784
There's nothing after that.

991
01:36:00,086 --> 01:36:01,986
Get me a list
of all the phone calls

992
01:36:01,988 --> 01:36:04,091
and appointments she made
while I was away.

993
01:36:05,524 --> 01:36:07,193
Magnus!

994
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,398
Yeah, sure.

995
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:17,335
- When was this taken?
- Two days ago.

996
01:36:17,337 --> 01:36:19,336
Oh, no, no, no, no.

997
01:36:19,338 --> 01:36:21,305
- I'm late to get her to school.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

998
01:36:21,307 --> 01:36:22,906
- I have to get to work.
- I am sorry.

999
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:24,843
I have one quick question
I need to ask you.

1000
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:27,211
- We have been over this hundreds of times.
- I know.

1001
01:36:27,213 --> 01:36:29,112
I know we have been over this
a hundred times,

1002
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:30,481
but I need to sort
something out.

1003
01:36:30,483 --> 01:36:32,482
Dr. Vetlesen was not working
at the clinic

1004
01:36:32,484 --> 01:36:34,384
the day your wife
was supposed to see him.

1005
01:36:34,386 --> 01:36:36,286
He wasn't there.

1006
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:38,223
- So she got the day wrong.
- I...

1007
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:39,590
- How the...
- Daddy!

1008
01:36:39,592 --> 01:36:41,625
Josephine, in the car.

1009
01:36:41,627 --> 01:36:44,862
How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?

1010
01:36:44,864 --> 01:36:46,598
Uh, sir, I'm just trying
to find your wife.

1011
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,898
Please help me.

1012
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,366
How the hell am I supposed

1013
01:36:49,368 --> 01:36:51,268
to remember
what day we saw him?

1014
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,403
Uh, sir, I'm just trying
to find your wife.

1015
01:36:53,405 --> 01:36:55,505
Please help me. I will...

1016
01:36:55,507 --> 01:36:57,208
How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?

1017
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:59,277
Sir, I'm trying
to find your wife.

1018
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:01,646
How the hell am I supposed to
remember what day we saw him?

1019
01:37:01,648 --> 01:37:02,981
Sir, I'm trying
to find your wife.

1020
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:04,382
- ...what day we saw him?
- Sir...

1021
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:06,416
- ...what day we saw him? ...what day...
- Sir...

1022
01:37:06,418 --> 01:37:08,218
Yes, I want all those files.

1023
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:10,120
- Send them to me.
- Give me your car keys.

1024
01:37:10,122 --> 01:37:11,925
- What?
- And your phone.

1025
01:37:43,523 --> 01:37:45,125
Yes?

1026
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,393
You told me Vetlesen

1027
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:50,995
was your wife's doctor
when we spoke.

1028
01:37:50,997 --> 01:37:54,331
And that you had no idea
why she'd gone to see him.

1029
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,035
Yes.

1030
01:37:57,037 --> 01:38:00,370
But you told my colleague
you both went to see him.

1031
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:03,210
She must have misheard me.

1032
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:07,344
She recorded the interview.

1033
01:38:12,185 --> 01:38:13,550
Darling, go back inside.

1034
01:38:13,552 --> 01:38:15,488
I'll come in
in a minute, okay?

1035
01:38:17,489 --> 01:38:19,059
Good girl.

1036
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,496
She isn't mine.

1037
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:27,902
Birte and I were trying
for another child.

1038
01:38:29,301 --> 01:38:31,635
We thought it might
save our marriage.

1039
01:38:31,637 --> 01:38:34,138
We had blood tests done
at the clinic

1040
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:35,342
for hormone treatment.

1041
01:38:36,475 --> 01:38:39,309
And it came out that...

1042
01:38:39,311 --> 01:38:41,547
she wasn't mine.

1043
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:46,183
I am infertile.

1044
01:38:46,185 --> 01:38:48,322
I've always been infertile.

1045
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,958
Can't have children.

1046
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:55,425
But she is mine.

1047
01:38:55,427 --> 01:38:57,661
Do you understand?

1048
01:38:57,663 --> 01:39:00,000
How could I not love her?

1049
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:07,041
But you didn't see Vetlesen
the day you found out.

1050
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:16,013
No, we saw
some hormone specialist.

1051
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:18,415
Visiting consultant.

1052
01:39:24,356 --> 01:39:26,260
Do you know his name?

1053
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:35,732
Yes?

1054
01:39:38,704 --> 01:39:40,341
Just a second.

1055
01:39:42,074 --> 01:39:43,340
Damn it.

1056
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:47,778
I said I'm coming.

1057
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:56,357
You never called.

1058
01:39:58,224 --> 01:40:00,223
Is Oleg back?

1059
01:40:00,225 --> 01:40:01,425
What? Oleg?

1060
01:40:01,427 --> 01:40:03,564
He... he's at school.

1061
01:40:05,064 --> 01:40:07,231
And Harry?

1062
01:40:07,233 --> 01:40:09,400
Is Harry here?

1063
01:40:11,104 --> 01:40:12,437
No.

1064
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:13,740
Oh.

1065
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:19,380
How did he convince you
to give him those pills?

1066
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:22,081
He didn't.

1067
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:25,715
You didn't have
to do it for me.

1068
01:40:25,717 --> 01:40:27,520
I didn't do it for you.

1069
01:40:37,529 --> 01:40:39,766
It was never about you.

1070
01:40:52,878 --> 01:40:55,213
I'm outside his house.

1071
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:56,714
I can't reach Rakel.

1072
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,719
Send someone to her apartment.

1073
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,342
Oleg.

1074
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,079
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1075
01:41:46,365 --> 01:41:48,534
Why do you have Mom's phone?

1076
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:54,205
Come on.

1077
01:42:09,956 --> 01:42:12,192
You and I have more in common
than you think.

1078
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,631
I didn't know
who my father was, either.

1079
01:42:35,948 --> 01:42:38,284
Magnus, track Rakel's phone.

1080
01:42:49,261 --> 01:42:50,827
Sorry, I just...

1081
01:42:56,235 --> 01:42:57,371
All right.

1082
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:00,972
Okay, Harry, we just
picked up her signal,

1083
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:02,940
<i>heading west towards Telemark.</i>

1084
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:04,909
<i>It is a red Volvo,</i>

1085
01:43:04,911 --> 01:43:07,277
<i>registered to
a Mathias Lund-Helgesen,</i>

1086
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:09,649
Rjukan, 2421.

1087
01:43:11,884 --> 01:43:13,683
<i>The house is pretty remote.</i>

1088
01:43:13,685 --> 01:43:15,518
There's-there's an access road,
but that's it.

1089
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,521
And there's a big lake
around it.

1090
01:43:17,523 --> 01:43:19,889
<i>Helicopters are grounded
because of the weather,</i>

1091
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:21,862
<i>but Delta is on their way.</i>

1092
01:43:24,564 --> 01:43:26,630
<i>Anything on Mathias's family?</i>

1093
01:43:26,632 --> 01:43:28,299
<i>Okay, I've got something here.</i>

1094
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:30,433
Jonas Lund-Helgesen,
former police officer,

1095
01:43:30,435 --> 01:43:32,836
lost his job in '89.

1096
01:43:32,838 --> 01:43:36,374
A scandal involving
a woman drowning in a car.

1097
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,708
Probable suicide.

1098
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,644
- <i>She had a son.</i>
- Stop!

1099
01:43:40,646 --> 01:43:42,580
<i>Father unknown.</i>

1100
01:43:42,582 --> 01:43:43,781
Please!

1101
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:45,482
<i>He was sent to an orphanage.</i>

1102
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:54,458
<i>Who led the investigation</i>

1103
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:56,460
<i>into the woman's disappearance?</i>

1104
01:43:56,462 --> 01:43:59,296
<i>Some local talent
in the village nearby.</i>

1105
01:43:59,298 --> 01:44:00,563
<i>What's his name?</i>

1106
01:44:00,565 --> 01:44:02,536
<i>Jonas Lund-Helgesen.</i>

1107
01:44:03,636 --> 01:44:05,969
Jonas! No!

1108
01:44:05,971 --> 01:44:07,506
Please stop!

1109
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,262
<i>Harry?</i>

1110
01:44:29,362 --> 01:44:30,697
Harry? We've lost him.

1111
01:46:28,948 --> 01:46:30,884
Sit down, Harry.

1112
01:46:42,194 --> 01:46:43,630
Pass me the gun.

1113
01:46:53,706 --> 01:46:55,708
I didn't think you'd find me.

1114
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:01,581
Perhaps the pills helped
after all.

1115
01:47:03,515 --> 01:47:05,985
I spoke to Filip Becker.

1116
01:47:08,887 --> 01:47:10,920
What's going to happen

1117
01:47:10,922 --> 01:47:14,795
when Josephine Becker
finds out he isn't her father?

1118
01:47:16,194 --> 01:47:18,728
She'll still love him.

1119
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:19,765
Wrong answer.

1120
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:32,512
Let's try again.

1121
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:35,879
Was it right
for Sylvia Ottersen

1122
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:38,048
to kill her unborn child

1123
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:40,150
simply because
she couldn't keep track

1124
01:47:40,152 --> 01:47:42,189
of who the father was?

1125
01:47:43,989 --> 01:47:45,992
That was her choice.

1126
01:47:48,694 --> 01:47:49,960
Too short.

1127
01:47:49,962 --> 01:47:52,532
Maybe she was afraid.

1128
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:58,204
What about you, Harry?

1129
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:01,841
You have a woman who loves you.

1130
01:48:02,975 --> 01:48:04,778
A boy who's devoted to you.

1131
01:48:06,578 --> 01:48:08,881
Why did you abandon them?

1132
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:13,317
They deserve better.

1133
01:48:14,854 --> 01:48:16,722
Too easy.

1134
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,924
Because...

1135
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:21,761
I'm selfish.

1136
01:48:24,229 --> 01:48:25,931
I'm an addict.

1137
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:31,738
There isn't enough room
for them.

1138
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,257
You know, when I first saw
your picture in the papers...

1139
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:56,660
...with all those medals,

1140
01:48:56,662 --> 01:49:01,967
I thought, "That man
must have a perfect family."

1141
01:49:07,038 --> 01:49:08,974
And here you are.

1142
01:49:10,141 --> 01:49:11,978
Last question.

1143
01:49:13,845 --> 01:49:18,317
This boy, who doesn't even know
who his father is...

1144
01:49:19,918 --> 01:49:22,018
...who's had to put up
with so many men

1145
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,724
like you and me
taking his place...

1146
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:31,064
...does his mother
deserve to live?

1147
01:49:35,234 --> 01:49:38,071
Why don't you ask him?

1148
01:50:22,148 --> 01:50:23,817
You all right?

1149
01:50:27,185 --> 01:50:30,023
Kill him. Kill him.

1150
01:50:31,122 --> 01:50:32,291
Kill him!

1151
01:51:08,793 --> 01:51:10,095
Come on!

1152
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:14,164
I'm ready!

1153
01:51:14,166 --> 01:51:16,133
I'm here!

1154
01:51:16,135 --> 01:51:17,401
Come on!

1155
01:51:50,101 --> 01:51:52,204
I know why you blame her.

1156
01:52:02,981 --> 01:52:05,385
You've been wrong
the whole time.

1157
01:52:12,024 --> 01:52:13,960
<i>It wasn't her.</i>

1158
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:23,002
It wasn't your mother
who didn't want you.

1159
01:52:24,936 --> 01:52:26,872
<i>It was your father.</i>

1160
01:52:30,141 --> 01:52:32,912
It would have been better
for him...

1161
01:52:36,114 --> 01:52:37,850
...had you not been born.

1162
01:54:00,431 --> 01:54:02,232
The pathologist detected traces

1163
01:54:02,234 --> 01:54:04,233
of the drug Ketanome.

1164
01:54:04,235 --> 01:54:06,335
But the direct cause of death
was drowning

1165
01:54:06,337 --> 01:54:08,571
as a result of blood
filling her lungs.

1166
01:54:08,573 --> 01:54:11,441
24 stab wounds
were found in her mouth,

1167
01:54:11,443 --> 01:54:13,277
all at regular intervals,

1168
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:15,278
and at the same depth...
seven centimeters.

1169
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,679
Pathologist can't determine

1170
01:54:16,681 --> 01:54:18,384
what kind of weapon was used.

1171
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:22,585
And he's never seen
anything like it.

1172
01:54:22,587 --> 01:54:25,187
I'll take it.

1173
