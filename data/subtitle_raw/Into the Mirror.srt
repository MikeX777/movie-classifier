1
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Good work with the report
last week, mate.

2
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Edison's transfer account?

3
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Sorry.

4
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
Wake up, pretty boy.

5
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm trying to pay you
a fucking compliment, mate. Huh?

6
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,040
You know, Harry. If you spent
some time working

7
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,920
rather than doing the rounds
maculating your employees,

8
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,680
this office might
be taken seriously.

9
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,760
Yeah, no one's talking
to you, Blu.

10
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
Beer on me tonight, huh?

11
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,720
- Okay.
- That's the spirit.

12
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,360
Honestly, well done on
that account, mate.

13
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,560
Brass balls, eh?

14
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Oh, hi, Daniel.

15
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,960
- Morning Chris.
- How are you?

16
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,160
- I'm good, thanks. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
- Glad it's Friday.
- Yes.

18
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
- Coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

19
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Oh, by the way, mate,
congratulations on that

20
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,720
transfer account.

21
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
- Thank you.
- Honestly, it's good work.

22
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,640
Thanks.

23
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,440
So how are you
finding the place?

24
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Yeah, it's, um, it's good.

25
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,480
Yeah, everyone's friendly,
and I'm enjoying the work.

26
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,120
Good. Good, I'm glad.

27
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,960
- Uh, here you go.
- Thank you.

28
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Uh, look,
if you ever need anything,

29
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,600
here's my card.

30
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Thanks.

31
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,280
Your welcome. Have a nice day.

32
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Yeah, you, too.

33
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,920
- congratulations!
- Thanks.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
So I guess you're going
to be staying here longer then?

35
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,360
- It looks that way.
- Cool.

36
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,040
- Chris is nice.
- Oy, yeah. He's lovely.

37
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,160
Unlike Harry. You just have
to ignore him.

38
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,720
He's like that with everyone.

39
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,680
Talking of the devil,

40
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
I need to make him
a cup of coffee.

41
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
- Yeah, back to work.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Oh, Dan?

43
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,160
- Oh, thank you.
- No, worries, "brass balls."

44
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Danny boy.

46
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,320
Everything alright, mate?

47
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,040
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh?

48
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,040
Yeah. Uh-huh.

49
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Well, see you out there, mate.

50
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
- Alright?
- Yeah.

51
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
Sorry, can you spare me?

52
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Thanks.

53
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,480
Cheers, mate.

54
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

55
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Am I, uh, interrupting?

56
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,000
So...

57
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
What do you think? Hm?

58
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
Girl in there?

59
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
Yeah, she's nice.

60
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,280
She is.

61
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
Who are you fucking then?

62
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Go on, who are you fucking?

63
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,160
- No one.
- No one?

64
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,120
You've been in London, what,
three months?

65
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,680
You need to get laid, mate.
You need to get laid.

66
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just joking,
I'm just joking.

67
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
But...

68
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,240
I need you around, mate.

69
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
Okay, come on. Come on.

70
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,160
- Give us two minutes.
- Alright.

71
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,640
Okay. I'll see you
in there, alright?

72
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,240
Lover boy, right? Lover boy.

73
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,320
Daniel!

74
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Daniel.

75
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,520
- Hey.
- Hi.

76
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
- How are you?
- Yeah.

77
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,640
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

78
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,280
So do you.

79
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,520
So why are you sneaking out?

80
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,680
How did you know
I was doing that?

81
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
I was spying on you
from across the road.

82
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm joking.

83
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,280
I just wanted to hide
from the new lot

84
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
and sat here
with a friend at the bar.

85
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh, okay.

86
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
There's my ride.

87
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,960
Do you want to join us
for a dance and drink?

88
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,160
Uh, I need to get back,
but next time.

89
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,176
- Thanks for the offer.
- Well, if you want to come,

90
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
address is on the back.

91
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,160
See ya.

92
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
Hi,
this is Daniel Reed.

93
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,576
Sorry I can't get
to the phone right now.

94
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,920
Leave a name, number,

95
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and a brief message,
I'll get back to you.

96
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Dan, it's me.

97
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,920
I've been meaning
to find something.

98
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,976
Look, I know
it's a couple of months

99
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,120
since it all happened,
and well...

100
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,880
I just want to try and sort
things out between us.

101
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
It'll be your mum's birthday
next week.

102
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,360
I think it's the right time.

103
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,520
Remember that time
when you were seven,

104
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,120
we had that day at the beach.

105
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,480
I found the old video.

106
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
I miss her, Daniel.

107
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
I miss you, too.

108
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,240
Your mum always understood you
better than I did.

109
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
The door's always open.

110
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,280
Good morning, handsome.

111
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,080
Let me guess, "Where am I?
What did I do?

112
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,960
How did I get here?"

113
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,320
Yeah, something like that.

114
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,880
You know, you were a hit
in there earlier.

115
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,320
It's okay to be one
of the lost ones.

116
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,720
You don't have
to be lost forever.

117
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
Thanks.

118
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
- Daniel.
- I know.

119
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,160
Jennifer.

120
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
- Thanks for the cig.
- It's yours.

121
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Oh.

122
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,680
See you.

123
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
See you soon.

124
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

125
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,160
Brought you some breakfast.

126
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,280
Do you want to come in?

127
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
How do you know
where I live, Blu?

128
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
You told me last night, stupid.

129
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Last night?

130
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Lost and Found?

131
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Sugar?

132
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Daniel?

133
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,520
No, thanks.

134
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,480
Why are you here, Blu?

135
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
Tonight's your big night.

136
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
I can't remember last night,
I was so drunk.

137
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Shut up and eat your breakfast.
Everything's fine.

138
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,760
Hey, Jen. You okay?

139
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,720
Look can you get
there early tonight?

140
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,760
- I'm going to be late.
- Yeah, that's fine.

141
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
How's Daniel?

142
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
Yeah, he's fine.

143
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,176
I've made sure he's got
everything he needs,

144
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
so it's all good.

145
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
Good. Well, take care of it,
would you?

146
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,320
- Yeah.
- Good.

147
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,480
- Okay, love you.
- Love you.

148
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,520
Love you, bye!

149
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Who was that?

150
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,520
- Jen.
- Jen?

151
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,280
Yeah, I, um...

152
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
Whatever I said to you
last night...

153
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,360
I...

154
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,560
I was joking.

155
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,840
Do you seriously don't remember
last night?

156
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,640
Daniel, it's fine.

157
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm not going to treat
this like a joke

158
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,760
like those twats
at the office.

159
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Look, it's okay.

160
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
I think you should leave.

161
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,520
Daniel, it's fine.

162
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,840
- I understand.
- You understand?

163
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,160
Just go, please.

164
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Please.

165
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,880
Daniel, it's me.

166
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Um, I just want to try
and sort things out between us.

167
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
Your mum always understood
you better than I did.

168
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,360
I miss her, Daniel.

169
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
And I miss you, too.

170
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
The door's always open.

171
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,440
You don't have
to be lost forever.

172
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,120
Can I help you?

173
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah, I've come to speak
to Blu.

174
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,696
I think you should
leave right now.

175
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,520
No, no, no. I know Blu.
I work with her.

176
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
This is Lost and Found, right?

177
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
Look, I was here last night.

178
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,440
I've got a Lost and Found card.

179
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,480
There she is.

180
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,280
Thank you.

181
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Blu?

182
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,080
- Hey.
- Daniel.

183
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,440
I needed to come and say

184
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,000
that I'm really sorry
I shouted...

185
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,320
Daniel, it's fine.

186
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,760
Everything I said
last night to you...

187
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
You don't need
to explain yourself.

188
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,440
I understand.

189
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Good luck.

190
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,840
Hi, Daniel.

191
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,320
You're covered I see.

192
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,800
Yeah, that was a...

193
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
A wild night.

194
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Yeah.

195
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,480
You're always welcomed here.

196
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,240
You're part of the family now.

197
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,280
Thank you.

198
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
See you soon.

199
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
Hey, Dad.

200
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Bye-bye.

201
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,520
- Good morning, Daniel.
- Hi, Jan. How are you?

202
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm well, thank you. And you?

203
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,080
I'm good, thank you.

204
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,360
- What time is it?
- It is 10 past eight.

205
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
Ten past eight, thank you.

206
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,800
Hey, cheeky chops!

207
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Morning.

208
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
Jan. Jan!

209
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,040
Jan!

210
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,120
- Oh, thank god it's Friday.
- Yeah.

211
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
That's a really lovely dress
by the way.

212
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,720
Oh, thank you.
I only got it yesterday.

213
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,200
Have a nice day.

214
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,960
You, too.
Have a lovey day, Daniel.

215
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
He's a nice boy, isn't he,
cheeky chops?

216
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,680
What do you think?

217
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
You were smiling, right?

218
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,336
I haven't seen you smile
like that for a while.

219
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Not for me anyway.

220
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,840
- Save it, Harry.
- Well, don't you like him?

221
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
Don't worry, we all do.

222
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
Your post is on your desk.

223
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
Alright, did you open it?

224
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah, right.
Well, you know what?

225
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,520
I was working.

226
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,640
Uh, Blu, coffee.

227
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
You either evolve,
or you fucking die, yeah.

228
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,560
Evolve or die, I've said it
to you before.

229
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,320
Alright, you think about that.

230
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,160
Danny boy. Drinks tonight,
nine o'clock.

231
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,920
And no sneaking away.

232
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,280
No sneaking off like last time.

233
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,720
What? What are you on?

234
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,160
Evening, ladies.

235
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,920
Evening, Gingee.

236
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I said, evening ladies!

237
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,560
Evening, Gingee!

238
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,440
Okay, Jen, how's it going?

239
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,440
I don't know.
I think I'm just about done.

240
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,840
Why, how do I look?

241
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,760
There are no words.

242
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
And that is why I love you.

243
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,640
- Daniel.
- Sorry.

244
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,880
Daniel, wait.

245
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,280
I can't even walk in these,
and my wig...

246
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,440
And I just feel so...

247
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,880
You look fantastic.

248
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Really?

249
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Daniel.

250
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
You know,

251
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,360
I've kept this in
all these years.

252
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,080
I don't...

253
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,360
I've never told anyone.

254
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,480
It’s that one person.

255
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,240
And she understood.

256
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,320
I'm sorry.

257
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,320
I don't know why I'm telling
you this...

258
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
I'm just really scared.

259
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,000
It's okay.

260
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,720
These things take time.

261
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,360
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

262
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,040
Look at you. You're here!

263
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,400
Not everyone feels comfortable
the first time.

264
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,200
You make a beautiful
young woman.

265
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,520
Showtime.

266
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,840
Daniel.

267
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,080
Oh, Danny.

268
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,360
Hello?

269
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,760
Hello?

270
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,760
I was like you once.

271
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,320
She's proud.

272
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,200
Follow this path,

273
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,320
and don't get lost.
