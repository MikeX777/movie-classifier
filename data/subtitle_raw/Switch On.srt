1
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,727
I'm Scott Tinker and
I study energy.

2
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:25,400
I was in remote Colombia to visit a family
living without modern energy of any kind.

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,929
This is the farm of an
Arhuaco tribal elder.

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,264
I'm Scott.

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,932
He lives here with his wife...

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,269
Their daughters and their
husbands, and lots of grandkids.

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,272
Hi.

8
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,441
[foreign language]
Alright.

9
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,445
Using farming methods
passed down over centuries,

10
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,947
the Arhuacos can grow everything they need.

11
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,450
[foreign language]

12
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,297
Beans, bananas...

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,554
And coffee. [Chuckle]
So this feeds everybody.

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
What is this?

15
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,229
For grinding?

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,858
Alright, here we go.

17
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:54,823
Everything here is produced with manual
labor. This press is their only machine.

18
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
Put your back in it.

19
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,466
What did we make, sugar cane?

20
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,279
It's good?

21
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,514
[foreign language]

22
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,432
I'll try it.

23
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:30,692
That's good. I wouldn't drink it
every night, but it's pretty good.

24
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,527
Gracias.

25
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,839
[foreign language]

26
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,365
I think he's done this
before, look at that.

27
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,202
[foreign language]

28
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,876
Oh wow, that's beautiful.

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,885
Eat it?

30
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:05,226
That's good. That's very good.

31
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,397
This seems like a pretty
good life but it's a hard life.

32
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,067
Only half of the Arhuaco children
will make it to adulthood.

33
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,555
Inside this hut, it was around
120 degrees and filled with smoke,

34
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,392
from their only energy source, fire.

35
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,754
Very little windows. What is
this hanging above the fire?

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:34,923
Banana.

37
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,925
Bananas, smoked bananas.

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,572
Mais. Secar mais.

39
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:49,604
Oh, they dry corn. That makes sense.
Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias.

40
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,585
The Arhuacos still get all of
their energy from burning wood,

41
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,946
and you might think
they're a fairly isolated case.

42
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:08,265
But in fact, there are one billion people
in rural Latin America, Africa, and Asia

43
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,100
who live like the Arhuacos do

44
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,962
with no electricity or
modern energy of any kind.

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,443
There are another one billion
people, most of them urban,

46
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,805
with limited energy that's
often unaffordable or dangerous.

47
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,785
Nearly all of these people
and a few hundred million more

48
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,957
still burn wood, straw, dung or
and other biomass for cooking or heating

49
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,316
and suffer from breathing its smoke.

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,989
These two plus billion people worldwide
live in what the UN calls energy poverty.

51
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:48,162
That's nearly a third of the planet without
access to safe, affordable, reliable energy.

52
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,165
In our last film, Switch,

53
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,169
we looked at the continuing energy
transition in the developed world.

54
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,339
We'll now focus on a
more profound transition

55
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,652
for the people moving out of energy poverty

56
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,679
and beginning to receive the many
benefits that energy brings.

57
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:12,186
We'll go to Ethiopia,
and Kenya, and Vietnam

58
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,500
to see how large new
grid-connected electricity projects

59
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,526
will power mostly urban citizens.

60
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,863
We'll go to Colombia and to Kenya again,

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:27,368
to meet rural people getting their first
electricity from off-grid solar solutions.

62
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,517
And we'll go to Nepal to meet people
transitioning from burning wood

63
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,044
to healthier modern cooking fuels.

64
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,049
Their stories are a microcosm of what's
happening across the developing world,

65
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,052
as people and communities Switch On.

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:54,395
On the other side of the mountain from the
Arhuaco farm is the village of Sabana Crespo.

67
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,873
It's a trading center

68
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,234
where families come down from the hills once
a week to exchange goods and see friends.

69
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:05,073
A couple of years ago, this rural
community got its first electricity ever.

70
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,219
Because here, the non-profit
Solar Electric Light Fund,

71
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,246
or SELF, installed a solar microgrid.

72
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,916
I met their CEO Bob Freling.

73
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,894
Scott Tinker: How did you
get involved in this village?

74
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,731
Bob Freling: Well, it all happened
when a leader of the Arhuaco people

75
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,069
came to Washington DC and requested our
support to come in and bring solar power

76
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,738
to his and several other villages here

77
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,931
in the Sierra Nevada
mountains of northern Colombia.

78
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:37,081
That is a remarkably rapid transformation
for indigenous people to make though, right?

79
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:42,586
BF: It's true. And we're very mindful of
the fact that not everybody in the world

80
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,924
wants this. We would never
go and impose our solutions

81
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,283
on a community that has not invited us.

82
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:54,789
For example, they have asked us not to
bring power to their homes and we haven't.

83
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,103
ST: So, this array, this micro-grid is powering
more of the community center type things?

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,296
BF: Correct, this is all for
community-based needs.

85
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,301
This system helps power
the coffee operations.

86
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,972
It's the only crop they
trade with outsiders.

87
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,621
It also powers lights
in the community store,

88
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,981
on the streets at night
and in the health center.

89
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,796
SELF's engineer, Steve McCarney,
showed me a smaller array

90
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,990
that powers a refrigerator
and freezer for vaccines.

91
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,260
Steve McCarney: This is a great
project that was funded

92
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,262
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

93
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,808
to basically prove that solar ice making
could be done and used for immunization

94
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:43,355
and the actual first solar direct drive
battery-free icemakers are right behind us.

95
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,316
Okay, fellas, here is the vaccine room.

96
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:52,013
And in here is the freezer, these are... The
serial number on this is probably 001 or 002.

97
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,516
This is frozen solid, solar energy.

98
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,828
Those are used for outreach.

99
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,330
They pack 'em with these ice
packs, take the vaccines out,

100
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,169
walk out sometimes up to three-day trips
from here so they can immunize outreach

101
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,361
locations far up in the mountains.

102
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,506
So it does extend beyond the village.

103
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,341
ST: Right.

104
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:14,511
BF: The catchment area for this
village is approximately 17,000 people.

105
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,679
ST: 17,000?

106
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,181
BF: 17,000 people...

107
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:22,352
ST: So your 12.5-kilowatt micro-array,
and some smaller ones around,

108
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,881
is actually servicing a
community of 17,000.

109
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,360
BF: You've seen what a little bit
of energy can do, right? ST: Yeah.

110
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:35,365
BF: We think about a few watts or a few thousand
watts in the United States, it's nothing, right?

111
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,891
ST: Yeah.

112
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,871
BF: But a few thousand watts of energy
make all the difference in the world.

113
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,395
ST: Yeah.

114
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,542
Bob and Steve have spent their
careers bringing off-grid electricity

115
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,711
to rural communities like this one.

116
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:53,574
To understand what it really takes to power the
people, I wanted to help them do more of it.

117
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:02,250
[music]

118
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,087
Halfway around the world
there's a different challenge.

119
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,901
Nepal sits between the northern
border of India and the Himalayas

120
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,427
and is one of the poorest
countries in the world.

121
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:19,100
Outside of its capital, most people are
farmers living a very traditional lifestyle.

122
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,602
[music]

123
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,917
I went there with environmental
health scientist, Dr. Amod Pokhrel,

124
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,110
who's been studying their cooking methods.

125
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,617
In the countryside, everything
is done by hand or foot.

126
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,141
Along the main road this small
furniture factory sells scrap wood.

127
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,812
Sanu Kanchi, a mother of five from a
nearby village, is here to buy some.

128
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,648
So why don't they get this
wood from the forest?

129
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,294
So the government opens community forest

130
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,154
for people to collect wood
only one time a year.

131
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,991
Yeah, because there is a big
problem of deforestation.

132
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,161
And then after that, they have
to purchase it from the market,

133
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,996
which is expensive like we'll see...

134
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,515
Scott: Yeah, so this is the market.

135
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,498
Amod Pokhrel: Yeah, this is the market.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,835
ST: I'm curious to see
how much this weighs.

137
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:35,509
21.3 kilos, so almost 45, 50 pounds.

138
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,989
How long will that last for cooking?

139
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,991
[foreign language]

140
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,492
AP: She said it goes for two weeks.

141
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,354
ST: About two weeks. So we need
25 of those every year,

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:51,359
and we just spent 200, so 5000.

143
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:56,864
So that's a lot of money. How much
money do you have each year to spend?

144
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,033
What money do you make?

145
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,369
[foreign language]

146
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,041
AP: So she doesn't know the exact...

147
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,188
But according to her she spends
a lot of money on purchasing...

148
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,024
ST: Probably maybe half of her income
or more. AP: Yeah, half of her income.

149
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,859
ST: Just on fuel.
AP: Just on fuel.

150
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,028
ST: For the fire.
AP: For the fire, to cook.

151
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,887
ST: That's a tremendous amount.

152
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
[music]

153
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,556
Sanu Kanchi is one of the more than
two billion people around the world

154
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,084
who still cooks with wood,
dung, straw, or other biomass.

155
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,636
[foreign language]

156
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,413
So we got corn, dried corn.

157
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,438
[foreign language]

158
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,442
Over here, mais.

159
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:29,266
ST: So people have been cooking over wood
and solid fuels for many hundreds of years.

160
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,603
AP: Yeah, thousands of years. And it's good
because this allowed people to boil water

161
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,942
and give warm food, which is
also helpful in terms of health.

162
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,112
But the smoke is the main issue here.

163
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:49,477
And so you can see there's no vent, ventilation,
any window opening for the smoke to go out.

164
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:55,316
Amod and his team monitor air quality in
more than 3000 households in this area.

165
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,654
The outside air pollution levels are about
50 parts per million of particulates.

166
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,301
ST: So two or three times a
day we're going to 900.

167
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,659
AP: Yeah, yeah.

168
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,000
ST: 15 to 20 times the standard. Every day.

169
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:22,176
Well, you can hear the kids, you can hear
their lungs, you can hear when they cough.

170
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,849
ST: And you've been cooking in your
home all your life, like this?

171
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,519
[foreign language]

172
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:38,859
AP: Yeah. She has always used biomass stoves,
she has not used any other modern fuel...

173
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:46,009
ST: I mean you can see the smoke, completely
darkened rafters and the loft above us.

174
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,844
AP: Yeah.

175
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,347
ST: That's really remarkable with
kids and things, the exposure...

176
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,681
AP: Yes.

177
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,541
ST: Through their lives.
AP: Yeah, yeah.

178
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,855
Amod and I went to the nearby
Siddhi Memorial Hospital

179
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,383
to see how breathing smoke was
affecting the local population.

180
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,555
She's beautiful.

181
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,725
[foreign language]

182
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,747
Okay. I'll just explain.

183
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,768
[foreign language]

184
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,437
How many do you see like this
every day? Who have the respiratory?

185
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,463
How many little kids?

186
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,656
The electricity is not working.

187
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,000
AP: This is a very common problem in Nepal.

188
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,313
In our study here, which was
conducted here in the same hospital,

189
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:08,342
we also found a very strong association
between pneumonia and use of biomass fuel.

190
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,014
Thank you, I hope she gets better.

191
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,685
[foreign language]

192
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,332
Sadly, children die
frequently here of pneumonia.

193
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:27,361
World Health Organization studies show
that diseases from indoor smoke inhalation

194
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,531
kill over 3 million people a year globally.

195
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,867
More than AIDS and malaria combined.

196
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,872
Clearly one of the most important
challenges facing the world today

197
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,712
is how the one-third of its people who
still burn wood can move to something else.

198
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,388
Back in Colombia, we went
with SELF to Gunchukwa,

199
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,725
another Arhuaco village that
had requested electricity.

200
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,894
But first, we had to go
through a cleansing ritual.

201
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,230
[music]

202
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,568
Osiris McCarney, SELF's operation
manager, showed us how it's done.

203
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,414
My son Derek helped organized this trip.

204
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,728
We had to bathe in Arhuaco's sacred waters
before we could meet the village

205
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,255
and address their spiritual
leaders, called Mamos.

206
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,940
Thank you for welcoming us to your village.

207
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,780
And we appreciate very much the nice
ceremony that we went through this morning.

208
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,452
It's very meaningful to us and we want
to extend our respect back to you.

209
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,288
[foreign language]

210
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,806
We are in a partnership
with SELF and Switch.

211
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,645
So our interest is to understand your needs

212
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,482
and if you have a need for electricity

213
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,154
in a way that we could help you,
we would like to learn that.

214
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,325
But only to the extent that you want it.

215
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,828
And we would work with you

216
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:51,505
to bring electricity to your village and
work with you to teach you how to maintain.

217
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,150
Now, we had a mission.

218
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,345
The Arhuacos of Gunchukwa asked for lights
and fans in their community buildings,

219
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,349
a street light in the square,
and a refrigerator for their store.

220
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:09,690
To power all that, like Sabana Crespo,
they would need an off-grid solar system

221
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,525
and we would build it.

222
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,195
[music]

223
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:20,367
But before we could do that, I was off
to Africa to look at on-grid solutions.

224
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,038
This is what you might expect
Ethiopia to look like.

225
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,427
But this is where it's headed.

226
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:46,393
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, is
rapidly modernizing and rapidly growing

227
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,896
and desperately needs more electricity.

228
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,233
To get it, they're building a huge new
hydropower project called the GERD,

229
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,403
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.

230
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,239
There are challenges to building any dam.

231
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:04,411
I talked to Rudo Sanyanga from a watchdog
group about perhaps the most important.

232
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:27,601
But a major dam like that produces
a tremendous amount of steady electricity.

233
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,914
But you're saying it
disproportionally benefits

234
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,416
those who are in cities that can benefit it

235
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,275
compared to those who are displaced.

236
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,987
Interesting.

237
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,826
I met with Dr. Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia's
Minister of Water and Electricity,

238
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,205
about how they'll power the city without
leaving their rural citizens behind.

239
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,848
Yes. Again, how do you get the electricity

240
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,018
in the country, into the hands of the poor?

241
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,855
There's villages that have
nothing, no electricity at all.

242
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Are you building power lines now?
Or the big networks being built?

243
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,705
To learn more, I was off to visit the GERD.

244
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,352
ST: It's nice to meet you, what's your
name? Lazarus: Nice to meet you, Lazarus.

245
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,544
ST: Lazarus, I'm Scott.

246
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,889
From the air, Addis Ababa
looks like any big US city.

247
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,560
In fact, it has a bigger population
than all of them except New York.

248
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,064
But this is not unique to Ethiopia.

249
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,067
In countries across
Africa, cities are growing.

250
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:46,215
Across Latin America, and especially
across developing Asia, it's happening too.

251
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,409
150 million people
moved to cities each year.

252
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,415
Almost half of the people in the developing
world already live in urban centers.

253
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,419
By 2050, it will be closer to 70%.

254
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,798
The future of the
developing world is urban.

255
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,904
Meeting the huge energy demands
of these densely populated

256
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,573
urban centers will be a great challenge

257
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,266
while balancing the
needs of rural citizens.

258
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,980
I'd see how they're doing this
at Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam.

259
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,984
It sits on the Blue Nile in the
desert on the border with Sudan.

260
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,503
I met with the general manager
of the entire project, Kifle Horo.

261
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,775
ST: This is called the Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance... Kifle Horo: Renaissance, yeah.

262
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,467
ST: Why Renaissance? What does that mean?

263
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,804
KH: Ethiopia was great some centuries ago.

264
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,451
That's why we called it "Renaissance,"
coming back to our greatness.

265
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,143
ST: Okay.

266
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:01,314
KH: The finance of this project comes from the
government of Ethiopia and from the public.

267
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,360
The public has a stake in
it, they are buying bond...

268
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,964
ST: They're putting their own money.
KH: Money, yes.

269
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,676
KH: Every year, they give
one month of their salary

270
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,662
on a bond basis, which will
be repaid after five years.

271
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,976
Think about that commitment.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,839
Many Ethiopians are putting one month of
salary each year toward bonds for the dam.

273
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,654
KH: The total intended
capacity is around 6.3 gigawatts.

274
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:36,492
ST: Yes. So that's six or
seven nuclear reactors?

275
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,352
KH: Exactly.
ST: This is big, massive.

276
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,835
KH: From the dam, water comes and the spiral
case guides the water into the turbine.

277
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,694
ST: The turbine, that's unbelievable.

278
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,864
KH: So huge.
ST: The scale of that.

279
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,532
KH: You can imagine the size.

280
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:04,353
ST: Wow, the scale of this is just crazy.

281
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,857
It's hard to appreciate
the size of this project.

282
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,885
When complete, it will provide electricity
for tens of millions of Ethiopians.

283
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,055
ST: What does this dam...

284
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,433
ST: How did that contribute to
lifting up the Ethiopia economically?

285
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,235
ST: So you'll be able to provide
electricity to citizens of Ethiopia?

286
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,097
ST: Yeah, for all of Africa.
KH: Yeah, all of Africa.

287
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:03,436
It seems the dam is well on the
way to achieving its power goals,

288
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,147
but what about the people it has displaced?

289
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,086
In the valley that will be flooded
to create the dam's reservoir,

290
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,588
I met with journalist Abraham Fisseha.

291
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:17,659
We're sitting here on the
upstream side of the GERD.

292
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,288
In a few years, we would be
under about 140 meters of water.

293
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:27,836
And there used to be people that lived here
in this area, and they're gonna be displaced

294
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,630
as this fills. How did they live?

295
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,633
It was a very primitive way of living.

296
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,970
Sometimes they are dependent on fishing.

297
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:42,309
But no farm, no other activities.

298
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,855
So now they have given them an opportunity,

299
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,027
even though it's not enough,
much better than they used to be.

300
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,156
They have never been to school,
they had no access to clean water.

301
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,326
So now with relocating them,

302
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,162
schools are open, clinic is open.

303
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,334
So at least, at the minimum,
they have an access.

304
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,045
Are many of these part of your family?

305
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,345
So your life is very different now?

306
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,683
[foreign language]

307
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:51,711
So, the electricity which
will come to this pole,

308
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,881
comes from the new dam.

309
00:27:55,382 --> 00:28:00,720
[foreign language]

310
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,366
Your little boy will be
able to go to school now.

311
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:09,372
So he could eventually... He
could learn to write and read.

312
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:13,400
[foreign language]

313
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,242
Not all rural people in Ethiopia
will get power from the dam

314
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,452
or react so positively to it.

315
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,747
But here, as in many developing regions,

316
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:32,252
big grid electricity projects
will drive commerce and power cities

317
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,422
and help expand the grid to power villages.

318
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,428
[music]

319
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,916
For most developing countries,
hydropower is one of two choices,

320
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,109
for large grid electricity projects.

321
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,279
I went to Vietnam to look at the other one.

322
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,800
Hang Nguyen, an energy planner,

323
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,453
told me how Vietnam will power
its urban centers and growing economy.

324
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,123
ST: There's a lot of construction
going on over here, in fact, there's

325
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,460
a big jackhammer down here
knocking things down.

326
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,345
So it's been hydro, but it's
going toward more coal?

327
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,181
Why is that, why not keep hydro?

328
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:18,191
So we've built all the dams that could be built
for the most part, or at least the big ones.

329
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,695
So you have to have something
else that feed that economy.

330
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,698
To power its continued growth,

331
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,912
Vietnam plans to double its entire
generation capacity in 10 years.

332
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,873
I went to see if they
could do that with coal.

333
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,210
And I'd start by going into a coal mine.

334
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,546
[foreign language]

335
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,394
[train rumble]

336
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,062
Riding this tiny train, deeper
and deeper into the earth

337
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,422
is enough to make anyone claustrophobic.

338
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,568
ST: How far do we go?

339
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,136
Andy Nguyen: We will
travel around two kilometers.

340
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,432
I was surprised by just how
many miners were there,

341
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,270
going into and out of the mine,
24 hours a day, on different shifts.

342
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,333
ST: Wow.

343
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,466
ST: Wow, that's about as good as it gets.

344
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,611
Pliable.

345
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,136
AN: The coal here is high quality.

346
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,512
ST: Yes, it is.
AN: It's very hot.

347
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,805
ST: Yes, it is.

348
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,695
ST: There it is.

349
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,329
ST: Alright. It's wet. It's a slurry.

350
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,832
[foreign language]

351
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,003
In Vietnam, working in a coal
mine is a steady high-paying job.

352
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,547
How long has this mine been operating?

353
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,674
[foreign language]

354
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,678
ST: Did your father work in this business?

355
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,178
Miner: Yes.
ST: Yes, he did.

356
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:53,823
ST: And you're...

357
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:54,847
[foreign language]

358
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,992
AN: My father, my grandfather also.

359
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,160
ST: Really?

360
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,519
So he's third generation.

361
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,187
[foreign language]

362
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,192
AN: My grandfather, my father, and now me.
ST: Yeah, here you are.

363
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,536
Coal leaves Vietnam's mines on trains
and passes through a network of coal towns.

364
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,914
[train horn]

365
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,020
Each town is made up
mostly of coal workers,

366
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,714
their families and the businesses
that support them.

367
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,867
Most of the coal is
headed toward the coast,

368
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,728
where it will eventually
be loaded and shipped on barges.

369
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,735
I went there with journalist, Andy Nguyen.

370
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,923
AN: This is a port where the ships
come to transport coal.

371
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,907
ST: Right. You can see the coal.

372
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,286
ST: So we are seeing at least
8 or 10 ships right here.

373
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,067
ST: They take it down the coast
back to rivers on a train,

374
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,761
and then to coal plants
and make electricity.

375
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,769
It appears Vietnam has the mining capacity,

376
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:28,649
the trained labor force and the transportation
system to support their coal growth plans.

377
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:35,114
And in the next 20 years, Vietnam plans
to build 50 new coal plants like this one.

378
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,824
ST: So where are we now?

379
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,619
AN: Master control room, the power plant.

380
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,600
ST: And so these guys, they're
basically measuring what? Generators?

381
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,792
AN: Ash.

382
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,605
ST: Oh, it's the ash.
He's looking at the ash.

383
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,506
ST: And this guy is
doing something different?

384
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,633
Water system.

385
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,636
ST: Oh the water system. AN:
Water system. ST: The cooling system.

386
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,471
ST: So everybody has a different job.

387
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,953
ST: Coal has many advantages, but one of
the challenges is just the air quality

388
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,830
the particulates in the ash.

389
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,147
So how do we fix that?

390
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,801
AN: So we do, we are using a limestone powder
to burn with coal to reduce the emissions.

391
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,493
ST: To get the sulfur.

392
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,329
AN: And the ash, the
second challenge is the ash.

393
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,352
AN: This is a conveyor
system to transport ash

394
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,505
from the power plant to
this area to store the ash.

395
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,340
ST: Is this all ash behind us?

396
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,842
[foreign language]

397
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,510
[foreign language]

398
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,514
AN: Around five million cubic meter of ash.

399
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,851
A lot of the ash ends up in this yard,

400
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,186
but a lot still goes out the stack.

401
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,499
I went to talk to some of the
people who live just downwind

402
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,192
from the coal plant to
see if this is a problem.

403
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,197
ST: Does everybody here, everybody
you know have electricity?

404
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:15,381
Yes, of course. When I was born, I had
electricity, my family had electricity.

405
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,760
So you work in a business, the
coal business, which is your life

406
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:26,601
and that business puts pollution.
Do you see that as a conflict?

407
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,204
No, she works for a railway company.

408
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:33,232
But these guys were in coal and the
whole community is based on coal

409
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,067
but it makes the environment...

410
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,111
So how do you change that?

411
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,113
[foreign language]

412
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,453
There are some ideas here. What's going on?

413
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,121
Yeah.

414
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,935
It does not come from the coal mine;
It comes from the thermal power plant.

415
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,896
From the plant.

416
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,421
Yeah. You see the white dust in the air.

417
00:36:55,922 --> 00:37:04,263
In the US, on the coal plants, we have
scrubbers that scrub this out before it goes up.

418
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,439
It makes it more expensive,
it makes it more expensive.

419
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,651
[foreign language]

420
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,946
What are some of the other
challenges in the community?

421
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,453
So you don't want coal to go away?

422
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,632
Coal powers Vietnam's
communities and businesses.

423
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,637
In exchange for these benefits, they
seem willing to accept its air pollution.

424
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,617
Vietnam will use coal to build an economy

425
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,477
that's strong enough to
eventually afford something else,

426
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,982
like many countries have and many will,
across the developing world.

427
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,194
Making the electricity is
just half the challenge.

428
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,990
The other is getting it to
the people who need it.

429
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,329
Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is another
one of Africa's fast-rising cities.

430
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,350
Here, over a million people live in slums

431
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,669
and many are struggling to get
safe, reliable electricity.

432
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,839
I went to visit Kibera, the largest slum,

433
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,342
with Kenya Power's Director of
Infrastructure, David Mwaniki.

434
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,013
Mafuta taa, makaa. What
does this say? Swahili.

435
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,004
ST: So charcoal here, we have
kerosene there. David Mwaniki: Yes.

436
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,507
So this is sort of
what it was, and still is.

437
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,010
Kind of where it's going some.
And that's the future.

438
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,410
That's the future.

439
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,542
ST: So this is a school?

440
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,377
DM: Yeah. It's a nice place to be.

441
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,589
ST: Did you grow up with electricity when
you were young? Did you have electricity?

442
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:12,391
That's perfect.

443
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,730
But that's the opportunity
that these kids will have.

444
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,134
That's phenomenal.

445
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,435
There was illegal connections?
Yes.

446
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,645
Run by?

447
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,773
Like cartels?

448
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,773
I met with Jaelle Mwalo
to find out how Kenya Power

449
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,508
worked with the cartels
to install electricity.

450
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,014
ST: So the cartels were here... Jael
Mwadiloh: Yeah. ST: And the next step was?

451
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,517
To engage the cartels.

452
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,636
William Opiyo is one of the local leaders

453
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,997
that Kenya Power identified
to help install power lines.

454
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,376
ST: We're walking under a brand
new power line here.

455
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:27,693
So Kenya Power put in the poles
and brought legal electricity,

456
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:33,199
and then the cartel said, "No.
We'll tap into it with drops."

457
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,034
William Opiyo: Yeah.
ST: Illegally.

458
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:40,581
Can we see one of those here or not?
Can you point to the illegal wire?

459
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,709
ST: Can I tell which one it is?
WO: Yeah I can see. ST: Which one?

460
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,420
Which one are we looking at?

461
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,547
ST: Right here?
WO: Yes. ST: Okay.

462
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,384
ST: And this one?
WO: Yes.

463
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,897
Wow. So William, these are homes?

464
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,401
I see four doors on this side,
and four down this side.

465
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,409
Hello! I'm Scott.

466
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,411
What's your name?

467
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,248
Dominic. It's nice to meet you.

468
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,918
Thanks for letting us come
to your home today and visit.

469
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,169
Dominic: Yeah. My pleasure.

470
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,898
ST: I can see you use
a lot of electricity.

471
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,425
What's this? What's
this here?

472
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,972
ST: What is it?

473
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,519
ST: Oh, this was Kenya Power's?

474
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,081
ST: And it's empty.
WO: Yeah. Yeah.

475
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,774
ST: And this is the illegal?
WO: Yeah. The illegal.

476
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:57,700
ST: Is it better for you for having
Kenya Power or this cartel power?

477
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,954
ST: It's safe?
Dominic: Yeah.

478
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,541
ST: Have you ever had an electrical
accident? Like you've got shocked?

479
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,877
ST: Yes?
Dominic: That is, oh yes.

480
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,338
Okay. So it's not very safe?

481
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,301
You are laughing because it's scary?

482
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,849
ST: Oh I see. Yes. That looks pretty scary.

483
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:27,354
ST: I mean tell me what happens with illegal
power like that. What are the concerns?

484
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:36,155
ST: Live wires? I mean what... I mean
that's got to have killed people!

485
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,323
WO: Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,165
ST: Children?
WO: Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,310
So when it rains...

488
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,002
Everything is metal.

489
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,674
ST: Boom! WO: Yes. ST: Wow.

490
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,515
So it's a real safety and security issue.

491
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:09,936
And the reason that's still there? Like,
why doesn't somebody go take it down?

492
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,360
Who would do it?

493
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,031
ST: You?
WO: Yes.

494
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:39,385
Around the world, there are about
one billion people living in slums,

495
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,556
and there are a grid expansion projects like
this in cities across developing Africa,

496
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,308
Asia and Latin America.

497
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,435
All will bring lighting and literacy,

498
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,064
communication and safety,
health care and refrigeration,

499
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,233
small business, and industry.

500
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,652
And all will struggle with corruption.

501
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,406
It's perhaps the biggest stumbling
block to energy development.

502
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,909
Hydroelectric dams,
particularly in African countries

503
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,078
where there are still good resources

504
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,664
will increase in size and in number.

505
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,585
They'll face challenges of financing,
environment and displacement of local people.

506
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:18,006
Coal electricity will grow
dramatically in Asian countries.

507
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:22,511
While it's declined in Europe and
North America over the last 40 years,

508
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:27,850
in Asia, coal use for power generation
has increased more than 1000%.

509
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:33,439
Regional particulate air pollution
and CO2 emissions have grown along with it.

510
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,254
It's clear that developing
countries will continue to grow,

511
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,321
urbanize and need more energy.

512
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,202
Reducing environmental impact and
corruption will remain two great challenges.

513
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,460
For the one billion people
living off the grid,

514
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,964
they'll need off-grid solutions like the
solar system we were building in Colombia.

515
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,550
[foreign language]

516
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:06,138
Here, people and equipment converge on
the tiny village of Pueblo Bayo,

517
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,391
where the pavement ends and the
road heads into the jungle.

518
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,786
It had taken a year of work

519
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,313
and a great deal of resources
to organize this trip.

520
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,865
Uno. Dos. Tres... Eso!

521
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,827
We asked our friends at REC
SOLAR to donate solar panels.

522
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,184
The panels were manufactured in Singapore,

523
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,002
shipped to Los Angeles
and trucked to Miami.

524
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,190
Let's back it up a little
so I can get my leg out.

525
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,548
[laughter]

526
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,238
The sun doesn't shine at night which
is when the Arhuacos need power.

527
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,349
That means a battery which
the panels will charge.

528
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,561
The batteries were made
in China, shipped to LA,

529
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,498
trucked to Ohio for testing

530
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,526
then joined our panels in Miami
for the trip to Barranquilla, Colombia.

531
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,010
From there, they passed through
three different trucks

532
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,913
and finally into ours to at last get here.

533
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,917
Most important, we brought a dozen
volunteers from the US and Colombia,

534
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,378
smart, able, educated people,

535
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,589
who Steve could teach how to
install a solar microgrid.

536
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,551
Well, I guess we got
over the first challenge.

537
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,928
There'll be a few more.

538
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,138
[music]

539
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,442
As we drove the last four
hours back into the jungle,

540
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,798
I couldn't help but wonder how much
transportation fuel was involved

541
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:51,577
in getting this solar system and all of
us who would install it out to Gunchukwa.

542
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:10,178
[background conversation]

543
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,814
ST: Towards me.

544
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,693
You ready? Watch your step on those stones.

545
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:29,489
Osi McCarney: Basically the
first message is: Welcome, welcome back.

546
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,785
Thank you for coming back. Thank
you for bringing this gift.

547
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,624
Steve McCarney: Yes, a
trend continued, perfect.

548
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,519
ST: I've been traveling in the last year,

549
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,380
and spoken in probably 10 or 15 countries,

550
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,508
and I always show pictures of
Gunchukwa. So Gunchukwa...

551
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,944
OM: Is traveling.

552
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:53,305
ST: Is going to be known
very well. And I hope that's okay.

553
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,034
OM: He says that he feels
that they are traveling.

554
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,393
ST: Yes. Yes, you are.

555
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,519
[laughter]

556
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,206
ST: And finally, I will thank our team,

557
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,026
we have volunteers from Colombia,
from around the United States,

558
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,463
students, young professionals,

559
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,991
that have all volunteered to come
here this week and to meet you

560
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,870
and to work with you and
bring our cultures together.

561
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:22,834
I was struck that it would take a similar
global convergence of people and technology

562
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:28,340
to electrify any of the hundreds of thousands of
rural villages around the world like Gunchukwa.

563
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,760
But for now we'd focused just on this one.

564
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,012
[music]

565
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,401
ST: Some places are so
rural that there aren't villages.

566
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:52,239
In the Maasai territories of Kenya,
a solar microgrid is too expensive.

567
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,574
Smaller off-grid solutions are required.

568
00:49:56,076 --> 00:50:01,623
Here I met with Isaiah, a member of the
Maasai tribe who is also a traveling salesman.

569
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,967
That's perfect, and they
get good reception here.

570
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,116
Isaiah, you were raised in this community?
Isaiah: Yes.

571
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,742
ST: You went to school here?
Isaiah: Yes.

572
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,227
Did you have any
electricity in school or home?

573
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,898
So this is really changing lives.

574
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,738
ST: That is fantastic.

575
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,763
Utility companies face so many
other challenges in developing countries

576
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,624
that stringing power lines to
scattered homes becomes a low priority,

577
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,921
but this makes it an opportunity
for businesses selling solar home systems.

578
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,470
Isaiah: This is the TV.
ST: The TV.

579
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,073
ST: Then I can see the battery.

580
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,575
Isaiah: Yeah, the battery is over there.

581
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,516
ST: Right.

582
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,611
Okay. Just pull it a little bit this way.

583
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,113
ST: Is that good?
Isaiah: Yeah, that one is good.

584
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,619
Isaiah: The TV is so
big. The TV comes here.

585
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,874
ST: Ah, the power line.
It's very quick. It's very easy.

586
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,127
Hello. Hello.

587
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,299
Hello. So I can activate it now.

588
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,016
Kenya is sometimes called the Silicon Valley
of distributed renewable energy solutions.

589
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:48,480
In Nairobi, I met with Pauline Githugu,
M-KOPA's Director of Marketing.

590
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,626
ST: This is big.

591
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,962
Pauline Githugu: Yeah, there's a lot going
on here. ST: How many people are in here?

592
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:59,967
We have about 200 staff who
are within the call center. ST: 200?

593
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:04,138
Yeah. And the basic activity
here is to support our customers,

594
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:09,477
so once they make the decision to buy
the product we have to switch it on.

595
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,478
ST: Yeah.
PG: Yeah.

596
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,003
ST: Young people.
PG: Yes.

597
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,505
A lot of buzz.

598
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:18,152
Yes, I'd say our average
age here is probably 28.

599
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,680
ST: Really? PG: Maybe even
younger within the call center.

600
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,493
PG: The payment, this
is done by mobile money.

601
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,663
ST: So that comes through a mobile network.

602
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,873
Yes, that comes through
a mobile network, so

603
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:35,402
this device has a SIM card. So
it operates like a mobile phone.

604
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,839
ST: So this is it.

605
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,200
If you don't have the ability
to use your phone and pay...

606
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,512
You don't do this.

607
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,846
No, you can't do this.

608
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,389
ST: This is the heart of your business.
PG: Yeah.

609
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,790
Is this something that Kenya,

610
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:55,690
M-KOPA and others can share and export
to the world as one of the key things?

611
00:52:55,714 --> 00:53:00,027
Absolutely. I think this is something
that we've proved can really work,

612
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:06,975
but it is really predicated on the
existence of a good mobile network.

613
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,561
In Kenya and many other countries,

614
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:15,066
tech startups like this one are allowing rural
families to buy their own off-grid electricity

615
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,612
which can help them get
something even more important.

616
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,952
On the outskirts of Nairobi,
I met with farmer, John Kidenda.

617
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:36,421
ST: Would all of this grow in natural
rainfall or do you have to use more water?

618
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,405
It's January now.

619
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,448
John Kidenda: We're in January.

620
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,431
[laughter]

621
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,580
ST: So you have to irrigate.

622
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,623
I have to irrigate.

623
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,524
How does the water get from
your system to the plants?

624
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,100
ST: Two panels.
JK: Two panels.

625
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,126
What does a system like this cost?

626
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,374
Okay, so your costs are covered
here by what you get every month.

627
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,066
Comfortably. Comfortably.
That's fanastic.

628
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,655
That's deep.

629
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,494
ST: Fifty feet!
JK: Yeah, fifty feet.

630
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,805
So it's really deep.

631
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,998
So you got a lot of water here.

632
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,837
Wow.

633
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:03,067
Samir Ibrahim is the
Kenyan-born American educated

634
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:08,346
Silicon Valley-style entrepreneur who
started SunCulture that built John's system.

635
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,824
Let's take a look at your pump.

636
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,659
Samir Ibrahim: This is the Rain Maker Two.

637
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,351
And this plugs right into here.

638
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,856
It's the strongest energy management
system for off-grid customers in Africa.

639
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,000
Really?
Yeah.

640
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,002
So there's a SIM card in there?

641
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,754
There's a SIM card in
there, WiFi, Bluetooth.

642
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,924
You can talk to things in the
field, so we are actually building,

643
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,511
We've built an Internet of
Things platform to bring

644
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:34,098
precision agriculture services
to farmers for the first time here.

645
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:34,873
Right.

646
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,209
In Africa, we have 60% of
the world's unused farmable land.

647
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,271
Okay. Of the world's
unused farmable land?

648
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,189
Of the world's unused farmable land.

649
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,758
We're the only continent when
we talk about water scarcity,

650
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:48,362
It's not a physical water scarcity,
it's an economic water scarcity

651
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,638
So people just can't afford
to just pull the water up.

652
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:58,372
My dream is to prove this out in a way
where we get dozens of companies doing this.

653
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,124
Yeah.

654
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:02,960
With hundreds of thousands, if
not millions of acres under irrigation

655
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:07,113
with modular energy management systems
so that people can plug in other appliances

656
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,909
and that people have the
choice of what they do.

657
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,971
I mean we are very fortunate.
We can choose what we do.

658
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,390
When we use power, when we take
a shower, when we watch TV.

659
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:16,933
Right.

660
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,584
We wanna give people that choice.
We wanna give people that freedom.

661
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,820
Can you imagine what affordable
access to water would do

662
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,305
to change the entire continent of Africa?

663
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,643
JK: Are you ready?
ST: I'm ready. Let's sprinkle.

664
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,771
JK: There.

665
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,440
JK: Wow.
ST: Whoa!

666
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,418
There you have it.

667
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,526
ST: That's spraying.

668
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,783
Now you're thinking big.

669
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:52,784
Yes.

670
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,704
In this and many developing regions,

671
00:56:56,996 --> 00:57:00,792
small electricity businesses
driven by local entrepreneurs

672
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,795
are using new tech to solve old problems.

673
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,025
In many cases, they have the
potential to scale faster

674
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,969
and reach rural customers
faster than power lines.

675
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,305
[music]

676
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:26,377
Back in Gunchukwa, our team of volunteers
has started the week-long process

677
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,361
of building the solar microgrid.

678
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,156
ST: First panel.

679
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,709
SM: Alright.

680
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,673
It's ready for us?

681
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,720
It's pretty close.
That good?

682
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,100
I think that's it.
Perfect sun.

683
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:04,022
SM: Mmm, yeah.
ST: No trees, pretty clearing.

684
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,693
As long as we don't get the
goats doing the tango on these things.

685
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,403
ST: First panel.

686
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,698
ST: It is good.

687
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,874
SM: You just get them in spots. This one
looks like it's gonna need to be loosened.

688
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,251
We've almost got our first sub-array.

689
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,128
Sterling Richard: We got a 35.5.

690
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:37,180
Doug Ratcliff: Okay, now I'm gonna
just pull it all through. Alright?

691
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,527
ST: Alright.

692
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,280
SM: Alright. We got three kilowatts.

693
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,407
ST: Congratulations.

694
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,326
[laughter]

695
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,348
ST: It's awesome.

696
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,872
The Arhuacos wanted to help.

697
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:08,294
They're farmers and were able to knock out the
trenches for the conduits in a matter of hours.

698
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:17,136
ST: I think when we left a year and a month
ago, we all had that moral conflict within us.

699
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:23,351
The conflict of, "Will this
improve this community or not?"

700
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,332
The challenge, I believe, that they're
wise enough to know about and face

701
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:34,070
is here in the beautiful Sierra Nevada,
places like this are becoming encroached upon.

702
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,283
And I think they know that
they have to be part of that.

703
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:45,307
And my hope is through all of
you and those that we reach,

704
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:49,627
we can communicate
what they bring and share

705
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:54,799
so that this busy, crazy
world that we come from

706
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,176
can become more like this one.

707
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,366
And if we can be one small voice
in how to find that balance,

708
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,394
then I think we will have made
a little bit of a difference.

709
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,874
SM: We're moving into
another phase on this work,

710
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,776
we've got it as we say in the
trades, we're out of the ground now.

711
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,672
So now we're gonna set
up the electrical system,

712
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,740
and so I wanted to just have a brief talk.

713
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:25,830
Essentially, what we're doing is we're
protecting the wiring from kids, animals,

714
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,042
and that's why you see a
light switch this high.

715
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:33,731
That's so kids don't run in here when
everybody else is busy with something else

716
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,215
and turn everything on, they
can't reach that so well.

717
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,177
ST: If we could put a little
glue on there and then...[click]

718
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,349
Paula: More? More? Yes.

719
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,352
ST: Yes Eric, yes Paula.

720
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,854
DT: It just pops on actually.
Sarah Jane Todd: Oh.

721
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,940
SM: So, every room's going to have a light.

722
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,109
DT: Ta-da.
Everyone: Yay.

723
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,088
SM: We spoke a lot about sustainability,

724
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:02,867
and the Achilles heel to all of
these mini-grid systems is the battery.

725
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,639
So the more times the light gets used,

726
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,082
the more time that
ceiling fans are running,

727
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,042
the bigger the battery has to be.

728
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,172
To wire the battery, we called
in the professionals from Bogota.

729
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,527
Every battery in every off-grid village

730
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,030
is technologically complex and dangerous,

731
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,139
if not handled correctly.

732
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,483
It may be the Achilles
heel of the mini-grid,

733
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,319
but it's also what makes it possible.

734
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,157
SM: Good work, fellas.

735
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,910
As a battery, that's as pretty as they get.

736
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,078
Alright.

737
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,834
SM: It's in place.
[laughing]

738
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,088
In 10 years' time, the battery
will need to be replaced.

739
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,674
The Arhuacos wanted this refrigerator,

740
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,194
so they could sell cold
drinks and popsicles

741
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:06,973
to raise $10,000 to $15,000 to buy
a new battery when the time comes.

742
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,413
SM: A lot of electricity is about
bringing the power to the load,

743
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,747
which is the lights,

744
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:17,084
and then switches are
what interrupt that power.

745
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:21,088
If you make a bad connection,
it's just like a switch.

746
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,465
It just breaks that continuity
and then nothing happens,

747
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,093
and then you don't know,
is it that connection?

748
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,553
Is it that connection?

749
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,556
Is it in the light, is it in the
electronics that feed the light?

750
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,391
Did somebody do something wrong back there?

751
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,753
So one error here means checking
sometimes five or six places,

752
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,273
which really sets the whole group back,

753
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,943
especially if it's Friday night and the goat's
cooking, and you're trying to figure out why

754
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:46,471
your circuit isn't lighting
and everyone else is.

755
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,018
We'd need everyone's help for
the last step of the install.

756
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,730
The Arhuacos had turned a
tree into this light post,

757
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,567
and the tropical hardwood
was nearly as heavy as steel.

758
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,549
DT: I always wanted to be a brace.

759
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,968
Solar micro-grids like this one

760
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:30,407
and solar home systems may not have
the power of a coal plant or a dam

761
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,266
to run cities and businesses.

762
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,270
But they'll bring electricity to
millions of off-grid citizens,

763
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,649
allowing their first steps
into the modern world.

764
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,862
All that was left here was for
the panels to charge the battery,

765
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:49,700
so we could switch on the lights
for the first time ever in Gunchukwa.

766
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,501
Perhaps the biggest energy
challenge in the developing world,

767
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,396
affecting both urban and rural citizens

768
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:06,759
is how to move from wood and other biomass
to fuels that produce less smoke.

769
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,847
In Nepal, I was ready to see how
they're making this transition.

770
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,701
I'd start in a suburb of the
capital city, Kathmandu,

771
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:18,062
where this plant bottles
Liquefied Petroleum Gas, or LPG,

772
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,291
the same fuel used in gas barbecue grills.

773
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,150
ST: We are surrounded by canisters.

774
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,258
So this operation is really growing then.

775
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:59,037
ST: How many homes are on LPG now,
do you think? Just rough percentage?

776
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,064
Amod Pokhrel: In Kathmandu Valley, 94%.

777
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,375
Oh, it's that high?

778
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:09,423
Yeah, 94% of the homes have LPG.
And 6% of households still use biomass.

779
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,157
ST: That's not much, though.
AP: Yeah, yeah.

780
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:17,848
ST: We talked about, it's a better fuel.
What are some of the challenges?

781
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:22,418
AP: There are many challenges.
For example, 100% comes from India.

782
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:26,648
Nepal is dependent on India
and there have been some hiccups,

783
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:30,635
like there was a blockade in 2015,
immediately after the earthquake

784
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,639
and the supply was cut for
about five-six months.

785
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,659
Because Nepal has a different
and a very difficult geography.

786
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,269
Then, prices increasing also,
that's another challenge.

787
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:43,290
Because it depends on
international market price also.

788
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:46,484
So, there are many challenges
also associated with this.

789
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,736
ST: Nothing's perfect.
AP: Nothing's perfect.

790
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,490
ST: Ready to take us?

791
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,244
ST: So it's interesting where all
the different people live, the things.

792
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,168
These look like pretty
modern buildings over here.

793
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,754
Here's the facility.

794
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,569
In lieu of pipelines, this is
Nepal's LPG distribution network.

795
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,696
Gas comes from refineries in India,

796
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,931
on ever smaller modes of transportation,

797
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,100
to reach the people who use it.

798
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,245
AP: We'll put this cylinder on a bicycle.

799
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,956
ST: On a bicycle?
AP: On a bicycle, yeah.

800
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,832
ST: Oh good.

801
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,042
AP: Yeah, so one bike
can carry two canisters.

802
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:31,797
ST: Okay, the roads look pretty good
for biking. How about I try it?

803
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,073
AP: Sure, yeah. ST: Can
I bike? AP: Yeah, sure.

804
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,283
AP: We'll help you put on the canister.
ST: Let's take them to a family.

805
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,844
AP: Just go straight.
ST: Okay.

806
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,453
AP: And then turn left
and I'll see you there.

807
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,808
ST: This might not go very straight,
but we're gonna give it a good run.

808
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,209
Wow, where did my heels go?
Alright, we're out of here.

809
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,391
ST: This is the house?
AP: Yeah, this is the house.

810
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,600
ST: This is the house?

811
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,728
AP: Yeah, everybody needs energy.

812
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,815
[foreign language]

813
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,579
AP: There's a blue flame.

814
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,685
ST: And no emissions, no smoke, no...

815
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,854
AP: No smoke. ST: Very
clean. AP: Yes, very clean.

816
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,023
ST: Ask her if she enjoys cooking with it.

817
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,132
[foreign language]

818
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,472
AP: Yeah, it's easy.
ST: It's easy.

819
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:45,061
In urban Nepal, most households
have chosen this easier, cleaner fuel,

820
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,731
which is available, because
there's a system to transport it.

821
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:54,278
But in rural Nepal, where the
roads are few and often unpaved,

822
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,781
LPG canisters are harder to come by.

823
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,910
Here, families need
another alternative to wood.

824
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,662
AP: The mountains.
ST: Yeah, that's beautiful. And the valley.

825
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,626
ST: A bunch of dried corn on the roof.

826
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,720
So, your kitchen.

827
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,723
And you're cooking, you're
boiling something here, I can see.

828
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,476
[foreign language]

829
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,105
ST: Making tea.
AP: Tea.

830
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,941
What are you cooking with?

831
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,236
[foreign language]

832
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,071
S: Gas
ST: Gas?

833
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:38,864
Gobar gas.

834
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,993
So, Gobar gas is a
dung-based gas, like biogas.

835
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,662
Animal dung-based biogas.

836
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,433
AP: It's cow dung.
ST: Cow dung. Okay.

837
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,792
And you like it?

838
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,462
[foreign language]

839
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,511
AP: Yes, you don't have to
buy cylinder, it's free. ST: Right.

840
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,348
AP: So you have one cow.

841
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,892
They can drink milk and then use dung.

842
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,123
ST: So they drink the milk, and they
use the dung and you cook again.

843
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,189
It's a perfect circle.

844
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:22,342
ST: So we're going to get
biomass and look at biogas?

845
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,678
AP: So we'll use dung.

846
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,912
ST: We'll use dung?
AP: This is cow dung.

847
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,598
ST: What's she gonna do?

848
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,267
AP: She'll put this dung in the bucket.

849
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,208
ST: She will?
AP: Yeah.

850
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,253
ST: I guess I probably ought to help, huh?
AP: Yeah.

851
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,464
ST: Oh, nice. That's nice.

852
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,010
ST: Biogas.
AP: Biogas.

853
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,476
ST: That's just a fresh one.
AP: Yes.

854
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,644
[laughing]

855
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,749
AP: So she'll put water.
Do you wanna wash your hands?

856
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,609
ST: Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'll wash my hands, sure.

857
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,736
AP: It'll serve two purposes.

858
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,156
ST: There you go. Efficiency.

859
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,116
AP: Efficiency, yeah.
ST: In every step.

860
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,261
ST: There you go.

861
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,285
[foreign language]

862
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,120
ST: Oh she's got to mix it first.

863
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,265
AP: Yeah, mix it. It has
to be thoroughly mixed.

864
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,999
ST: Oh, I'm glad I already washed my hands.

865
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,461
AP: It has to be thoroughly
mixed and then stir it.

866
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,010
ST: Now I take this here?

867
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:24,929
ST: Now I pour it?

868
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,934
ST: Alright. Oh, yeah, that's
nice. That's not very deep.

869
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,191
AP: So the toilet is also connected.

870
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,985
ST: This is the...
AP: Human waste also goes there.

871
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,864
ST: Nobody's there, luckily.
I just opened the door.

872
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:49,912
So Amod, here we got a concrete
canister and a bunch of stuff in it.

873
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,473
And then there's gas up in the kitchen.

874
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,706
What's the process?

875
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:57,896
AP: So this is an inlet, you put mix
of dung and then water, you stir it,

876
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,716
And then methane is in the
bacteria that works on the manure.

877
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,070
And then it generates biogas.

878
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,324
And then people get biogas through that
pipe. That yellow pipe you'll see.

879
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:13,036
And then it goes to that house.
So this is a 6 cubic meter biogas system.

880
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,688
But, people are building
like 20 cubic meter.

881
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,190
ST: Well, let's go see one of the
bigger ones. AP: Yeah, let's go.

882
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:35,558
ST: So, where do you put
in the dung and the water?

883
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,143
AP: So it will be there.
ST: Oh, wow.

884
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,688
AP: So it will be there. ST: That's a
big room there. AP: It's a big room, yeah.

885
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,715
ST: There's a concrete dome
over the big chamber. AP: Yeah.

886
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,842
And how much biogas will this make?

887
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,403
[foreign language]

888
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:52,325
So it provides you with gas enough for eight
hours to cook food for six family members.

889
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,225
Wow.

890
01:11:56,353 --> 01:12:01,025
ST: So, wonderful system. Where
can it be put around the world?

891
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,278
It can go a lot of places. For
example, if it works in Nepal.

892
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:07,882
There's lots of opportunity to
upscale this in South Asia and Africa.

893
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,552
ST: South America? AP: South
America. ST: Sure. That's good.

894
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,995
AP: If it's possible in Nepal,
then it's possible everywhere.

895
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,163
ST: Right, right.

896
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:18,643
Both these gas solutions: LPG and Biogas,

897
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,296
produce a tiny fraction of the
particulates of burning wood.

898
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,692
And everywhere that particulate
pollution has declined,

899
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,594
respiratory disease has
plummeted along with it.

900
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:34,224
LPG use is growing rapidly, especially
in urban areas across Asia and Africa,

901
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,937
where there are refineries to produce
the gas and road systems to transport it.

902
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,399
There are half a million
biogas systems in Nepal alone.

903
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,861
These could be well suited to
rural areas around the world,

904
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,466
wherever there's livestock to
make the manure that fuels them,

905
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,743
and temperate climates to keep
them from freezing or drying out.

906
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,347
These modern cooking fuels,

907
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,583
combined with access to affordable
on-grid and off-grid electricity,

908
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:04,213
will help literally billions of
people live better, healthier lives.

909
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,177
For my last stop in Nepal, Amod wanted to
show me the newest alternative to wood.

910
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,016
As grid electricity from hydropower
becomes more available and reliable,

911
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,269
a market for electric
cook-tops is springing up.

912
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,750
AP: So Scott, this is the
store that I was referring to,

913
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,251
and one of the entrepreneurs

914
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,403
that is selling induction stoves.

915
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:29,780
ST: It's beautiful.

916
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,156
[foreign language]

917
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,511
AP: So if you want to cook rice.
ST: Right.

918
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,055
AP: Then you press this rice button.
ST: Yeah.

919
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,665
AP: So, if you want to boil
water, then you press water button.

920
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,127
[foreign language]

921
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:48,173
Yeah, if you wanna fry, then you can press
this. So she's saying that it's easy.

922
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,219
How many of these have
you sold in your store?

923
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,973
[foreign language]

924
01:13:56,014 --> 01:14:00,269
Overall 60 induction stoves have
been sold. But she has sold 10.

925
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,188
ST: 10 from here? AP: 10 from here.
ST: And how much time did that take?

926
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,334
Within one month.

927
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,444
Wow, that's amazing.

928
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,506
Are you seeing that bigger
trend in the Valley as well?

929
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,700
Yes, yes, so other people are buying it.

930
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,161
From other markets
also or other stores also.

931
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,848
How much would this cost?

932
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,206
[foreign language]

933
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,185
5500 Nepali rupees.

934
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:29,756
5500 rupees. So that's
about $55. That's a lot.

935
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,092
AP: Yeah.
ST: But you're selling still that many.

936
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:36,930
You know what? Sold. I'll
take it, I'll take it today.

937
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,517
That's beautiful.

938
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:44,563
ST: Thank you so much.
Store Owner: Thank you.

939
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,533
[foreign language]

940
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,745
I found your son out there.

941
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,124
We have something to give you.

942
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,713
Electric cooking.

943
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,678
Have you seen that before?

944
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,599
ST: No. Should we open it?

945
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,479
It's for your pot to sit.

946
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:36,323
Now, we plug it in to electricity,

947
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:41,954
which Amod will help you get to your house

948
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:45,123
and it costs less money than wood.

949
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,430
Very good. And there will be no smoke.

950
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,525
[foreign language]

951
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,071
She's asking if we'd like to have tea.

952
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,799
Absolutely.

953
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,092
[laughing]

954
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,075
Let's have tea.

955
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,766
In Gunchukwa, it's Friday night,

956
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,625
and the goat is cooking,

957
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,669
and there was just one thing left to do.

958
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:39,177
We gathered everyone in the village
square to turn the lights on together.

959
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,723
It's a very exciting time.

960
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,559
[foreign language]

961
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:49,688
A year ago we came as
strangers to Gunchukwa.

962
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,024
Today, we are here as friends.

963
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:57,404
And now we're going to
count backwards from five.

964
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:03,076
We will say, "Five, Four, Three,
Two, One, Light," together.

965
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,204
We will do it very loudly. Are you ready?

966
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,290
ST: In Espanol and English.

967
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,542
OM: Yes. Okay.
ST: Ready.

968
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:20,802
Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Light.

969
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,423
ST: On the count of three, a big duni.

970
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,676
Everyone: One, Two, Three...

971
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:57,149
Energy powers the people
