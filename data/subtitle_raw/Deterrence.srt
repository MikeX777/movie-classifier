WE GOT THE PRICK
BY THE BALLS.
HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

342
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,417
CALL HIM UP AND TELL HIM
THE DEAL'S STILL ON, BUT HE
HAS WITHDRAW BY NOON TOMORROW.

343
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,388
OTHERWISE, NO DEAL.
HE'S GOT NO MANEUVERING ROOM
TO EVEN CHANGE THE PLATFORM.

344
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,123

LIKE HE'S GOT A LITTLE
WRIGGLE ROOM, RIGHT ?

00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,492

JUST PROCEED AHEAD ?
WE'RE GONNA WIN ANYWAYS.

00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:00,232
LET'S JUST--

348
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:00,232
NO, HE'S AT THE HYATT.
I'M GONNA CALL HIM NOW.

HOTEL ROOM WITH A BLONDE,

THAN I.

OF HERE, BY THE WAY ?

TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

361
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,238
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED THAT HE RECEIVED
THE VOTES THAT HE DID.

362
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,875
MANY PEOPLE VIEW EMERSON
AS NOT PRESIDENTIAL.

363
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,878
HE'S VERY VICE PRESIDENTIAL,
VERY SECOND BANANA.

364
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:49,381
HIS EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN POSTS
HAS CERTAINLY BEEN STRONG.

365
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,083
HE BOASTS PROBABLY
ONE OF THE BEST RESUMES
SINCE GEORGE BUSH.

366
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,153
TRUE, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
THE PHYSICAL BEARING
OF A PRESIDENT.

BEEN ASCRIBED TO HAR--

I'LL SAY THIS QUICK.

FROM OUR CORRESPONDENTS...

<i> [ Lancaster ]
 I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE TIME.</i>

488
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,571
FRANK, DOES HE HAVE IT ?

489
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,939
WHAT ?  HE HAS WHAT ?
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ?

490
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,977
NO, SIR,
BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL.

491
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,346
[ Secretary of Defense ]
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A COMPUTER SCREEN.

492
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:51,482
THE IMAGERY APPEARS TO DISPLAY
LAUNCHING PADS FOR IRAQI...

493
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,453
TACTICAL, CHEMICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.

494
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,454
[ Lancaster ]
THE SITE THAT WE HAVE THERE...

495
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:59,390
CONTAINS EIGHT
CANVAS-COVERED
MISSILE TRAILERS...

496
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,293
AND FOUR DEPLOYED
PROBABLE MISSILE LAUNCHERS.

497
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,862
HOW FAR ADVANCED IS THIS ?

498
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,862
I'VE NEVER SEEN...

499
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,432
THIS KIND
OF INSTALLATION BEFORE.

500
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,434
THESE ARE
M.R.B.M.s.

501
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,434
OKAY.

502
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,103
ARE THEY READY TO BE FIRED,
ANY OF THEM ?

503
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,373
[ Secretary of Defense ]
THAT WOULD DEPEND
ON THEIR GROUND SUPPORT.

504
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,307
I'M HESITANT TO SAY,
BUT CONSERVATIVELY,

505
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,776
THE EARLIEST
THEY COULD LAUNCH
IS IN ONE HOUR, FORTY MINUTES.

506
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,513
THEY LOOK POSITIONED
TO ATTACK TEL AVIV.

507
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,513
TEL AVIV.

508
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,415
<i> IN ISRAEL,
 SIR.</i>

509
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,415
<i> THANK YOU.</i>

510
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,684
AND GREECE
 AND TURKEY AS WELL.

511
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,687
-<i> WHERE ARE THESE LAUNCH PADS ?
 - OUTSIDE RABAT, A FEW CLICKS
   FROM THE TURKISH BORDER.</i>

512
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,490
THEY'RE MOBILE.
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
WE HAD NOT YET SEEN THEM.

513
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,927
JESUS.  MARSH,
WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW
OVER AT IBS ?

514
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,928
CARL ISAACSON.

515
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,928
ISAACSON.

516
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,998
HOWARD, YOU WANT TO HOOK UP
THIS ISAACSON FELLOW
WITH MARSH ?

517
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,768
THEN GET ME BEN-RAZZI.
I'M SURE HE'S ON TOP
OF THIS ALREADY.

518
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,337
<i> MARSH, I'M GOING
 TO HAVE TO ADDRESS
 THE NATION.</i>

519
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:49,675
- LET'S TALK TO THIS IBS GUY--
- NO, NO, NO.  NO, I DON'T THINK
  YOU SHOULD ADDRESS THE NATION.

520
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,277
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

521
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,277
JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.

522
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,480
BUT THE WRITERS
AREN'T EVEN HERE.

523
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,480
PLEASE.

524
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,651
OKAY.  UH, HOWARD,
AS SOON AS YOU GOT
ISAACSON, LET ME KNOW.

525
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,519
BRING HIM
RIGHT UP.

526
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,422
GIVE ME WHAT OUR TROOP
MOBILIZATION STATUS IS.

527
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:07,725
WE CAN BEGIN DEFCON 1
AND MOBILIZATION
OF 3,000...

528
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,860
IN LESS THAN
AN HOUR.

529
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,164
WE WOULD RELEASE
THE TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
AT LANGLEY...

530
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,632
AND THEN
THE DIVISION READY BRIGADE
AT THE 82nd.

531
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,835
AND THAT WOULD
PUT THEM IN IRAQ WHEN ?

532
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,437
PARTIAL PROLIFERATION
IN TEN DAYS.

533
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:22,439
THEN WE'D HAVE
TO SLASH OUR TROOP STRENGTH
IN THE KOREAS.

534
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,976
BUT I BELIEVE--
I'M SORRY, SIR.
MAY I INTERRUPT ?

535
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,980
I BELIEVE PREMIER KIM
WHEN HE SAYS THAT
A DOWNSIZING OF OUR TROOPS...

536
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,049
ON THE 38th PARALLEL
WILL PROPEL HIM...

537
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,251
INTO A FLAT-OUT INVASION
OF NORTH KOREA.

538
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,021
I'M NOT GONNA DROP A DOMINO
AND ALLOW CHINA TO WALK
INTO JAPAN, BOTTOM LINE.

539
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:39,658
I'M CERTAINLY
NOT GONNA OFFER UP
ANOTHER TINY FORCE,

540
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,493
NAKED AND VULNERABLE
TO HUSSEIN IN THE GULF,

541
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,896
NOT LIKE THE 300

542
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,731
YEAH.

543
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,731
RIGHT, SIR.

544
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:49,667
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT WE HAVE NO MANPOWER
IN THE GULF AREA ?

545
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,837
-<i> THERE IS ONE CARRIER.
  IT'S THE</i> U.S.S.--
- WAIT.  HOLD IT.

546
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,972
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
THERE WAS A CARRIER ?

547
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,142
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE POINT
OF THIS CONVERSATION IS ?

548
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,142
SIR, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO--

549
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,079
NOW YOU'RE TELLING US
THERE'S ONE CARRIER.

550
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,079
THEU.S.S. POWELL.

551
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,981
UH, HOLD ON, SIR.
HOLD ON, PLEASE.

552
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,981
YES ?

553
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,984
WE'RE JUST GETTING
THE PICTURES
FROM THE N.P.I.C.

554
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,918
<i> [ Marsh ]
 WHAT'S THAT ?
 IS THAT OURS ?</i>

555
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,990
IBS CORRESPONDENTS
HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THREE
IRAQI DIVISIONS--

556
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,392
THE HAMMURABI,
THE MEDINA LUMINOUS...

557
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,461
AND THE IN GOD WE TRUST--
ARE IN KUWAIT.

558
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:19,898
THE KUWAITI MILITARY FORCE
OF A FEW THOUSAND TROOPS...

559
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,867
MUST NOW CONTEND
WITH A HALF A MILLION
IRAQI TROOPS.

560
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,503
UDEI'S NOT GONNA MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES
HIS FATHER MADE.

561
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,871
HE'S NOT GONNA WAIT FOR US
TO BUILD UP OUR STRENGTH.

562
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,871
ALL RIGHT.

563
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:31,409
THERE'S NO TOUGHER
MILITARY PROPOSITION
THAN REVERSING AN INVASION,

564
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,311
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

565
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,846
I'M GONNA HANG UP THE LINE.
I'LL BE BACK TO YOU
IN TEN MINUTES.

566
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:38,550
WHEN I DO, I EXPECT TO BE ABLE
TO CONFERENCE CALL.  HOWARD ?

567
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,119
CONFERENCE CALL MAKES
OUR LINE UNSECURE, SIR.

568
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,420
HOW MANY SPEAKERPHONES
CAN WE SET UP, THEN ?

569
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,224
WE HAVE FOUR SECURE
SATELLITE SPEAKERPHONES
LIKE THIS ONE.

570
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,293
THEY'RE TRAINED ON
THE SIERRA SYSTEM.

571
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,460
BUT WE'VE GOT SOME
CELL PHONES, DON'T WE ?

572
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,864
NO, THOSE ARE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
IN TERMS OF SECURITY.

573
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,667
I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO
IS WE SHOULD STICK
WITH THE SATELLITES,

574
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,903
AND I'LL PLACE THE CALLS
THROUGH MY Q-LINE.

575

THERE ARE SEVERAL UNAUTHORIZED
PEOPLE HERE.  I DON'T THINK--

576

THAT IS MY DECISION.

577
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:04,342

NOT GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT.

OF ONE OF THESE PHONES--

592
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:30,668
NO, I NEED THE PHONE LINES.

00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,454
LOUD AND CLEAR.

647
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,454
GOOD.

648
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:33,425
OKAY.  ALL RIGHT.

649
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:33,425
I'LL GET WORD
TO HIGHLAND HILLS.

650
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,296
NOW, LISTEN.  I DON'T WANT
ANY OF THIS<i> 60 MINUTES
 HIDDEN CAMERA BULLSHIT.</i>

651
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,465
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
YOU GO OVER THERE.

652
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,435
SIR, I HAVE PRIME MINISTER
BEN-RAZZI ON THE PHONE.

653
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,040
MR. PRIME MINISTER.

654
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,476
YES, SIR, I'M FULLY
AWARE OF THE GRAVITY
OF THE SITUATION.

655
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:58,383
YES, SIR, WELL,
SOON MY COUNTRY WILL BE
AT A STATE OF FULL READINESS.

656
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:04,589
I UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ?  NO, SIR.

657
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,390
SIR, I BEG OF YOU
TO RECALL THOSE PLANES,

658
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,761
OR AT LEAST
KEEP THEM IN YOUR AIRSPACE
FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES.

659
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,531
NO, NO, I SEE THIS
NO DIFFERENTLY
THAN BUSH DID IN '91.

660
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:17,335
AN INCURSION ON YOUR PART
WILL ONLY FORM AN ALLIANCE
AMONG THE ARAB NATIONS.

661
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,706
WELL, MR. PRIME--
MR. PRIME MINISTER,

662
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,342
I'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS
TO GO ON IBS LIVE...

663
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,912
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES HERE.

664
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,214
GLOBALLY, YES.

665
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:33,918
EXACTLY.  EXACTLY.

666
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:37,522
THAT WOULD--
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

667
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,524
YES, SIR.

668
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,895
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE
ANY NEED TO TAKE AN OFFENSIVE
ACTION AT THAT POINT.

669
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,898
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, MR. PRIME MINISTER.

670
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,900
OKAY.

671
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,900
THE PRIME MINISTER
HAS AGREED...

672
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,070
TO KEEP HIS AIR FORCE
IN ABEYANCE UNTIL AFTER
THE ADDRESS.

673
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,006
LET'S KEEP AN OPEN,
SECURE LINE THERE.  OKAY.

674
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,643
LET'S GET READY
FOR THE ADDRESS.

675
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,643
OKAY.

676
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,079
ALL RIGHT.
NO, OFF, OFF, OFF.

677
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,982
WE'RE NOT READY YET.

678
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,653
[ Marsh ]
FACTS, FIGURES, LOCATIONS
ARE NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

679
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:12,457
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO CONVEY A SENSE
OF DETERMINATION...

680
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,525
ABOUT WHAT IT IS
WE'RE GONNA DO AS A COUNTRY.

681
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:17,495
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE TO HEAR.  THAT'S WHAT
THIS SPEECH IS ABOUT.

682
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,798
I CAN VERIFY
WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE,
OBVIOUSLY.

683
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,000
YES.

684
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,000
AND THEN I NEED TO BE
VERY, VERY SPECIFIC.

685
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,270
YEAH.  IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN GENERAL WATERS,
BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT IT.

686
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,105
EXCUSE ME, MR. PRESIDENT.

687
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:31,176
AS YOUR NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR,
I MUST INFORM YOU...

688
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,513
THAT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO
IS NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
OR THAT OF THE COUNTRY.

689
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,382
NOTED.  ON THE RECORD.
HOWEVER, HE IS GOING ON
IN A FEW MINUTES.

690
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,352
<i> SO IS THERE ANYTHING
 THAT YOU CAN ADVISE
 THE PRESIDENT...</i>

691
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,555
<i> THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL
 FOR WHAT HE IS ABOUT TO SAY
 TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ?</i>

692
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:47,758
IF UDEI IS IN KUWAIT
ON HIS WAY TO SAUDI ARABIA,

693
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,862
THAT MEANS
THAT HE HAS CLEARED OUT
ALL OF THE MINEFIELDS.

694
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:55,099
WE ARE NOT TALKING
BRIGADES HERE.
WE ARE TALKING<i> ARMIES.</i>

695
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,101
I APPRECIATE THAT
VERY MUCH--

696
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,101
THE REPUBLICAN GUARD...

697
00:28:57,101 --> 00:29:00,672
IS OUT IN FULL FORCE,
AND THAT IS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT MATTER HERE, SIR.

698
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,773
THE DEBATE IS OVER.
I'M GOING ON THE AIR.

699
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,773
NOAH ?

700
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:05,443
YES.

701
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:05,443
WE HAVE TO BRING THE MONITOR
OVER WHERE I CAN READ IT...

702
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,311
AND THE PRESIDENT
CAN SEE IT.

703
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:09,379
[ Noah ]
I'M JUST GRABBING
MY TRIPOD.  JUST A SEC.

704
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,382
<i> I'LL WATCH THE MONITOR
 AND MAKE SURE THAT IBS--</i>

705
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,051
<i> REMEMBER,
 IBS IS WAY AHEAD
 OF EVERYBODY ON THIS.</i>

706
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,153
EVERYBODY KNOWS BASICALLY
WHAT'S GOING ON.

707
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:19,257
I NEED TO GO ON
AND BE VERY SPECIFIC
ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING ABOUT IT.

708
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,726
<i> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
 WHO CAN DO THAT.</i>

709
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,726
<i> LET'S DO THIS.</i>

710
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,827
<i> [ Marsh ]
 WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
 HOLD IT, HOLD IT.</i>

711
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:26,631
WE NEED A DIFFERENT CHAIR.
THIS CHAIR IS NOT ANY GOOD.

712
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,867
IT'S THE ONLY CHAIR
WE GOT.

713
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,867
THIS IS RIDICULOUS,
 THIS CHAIR.

714
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,570
THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE
ARMORED DIVISIONS IN KUWAIT.

715
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,339
OKAY, NOW, LISTEN.
IN THE RED ?

716
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:37,609
BAD COLOR.
IT'S A DISTRACTION.
IF YOU COULD JUST--

717
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,776
EVERYBODY, ACTUALLY,
JUST MOVE TO THAT SIDE.

718
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,547
[ Irving ]
IRAQ STILL USES SOVIET MIGs
IN ITS AIR FORCE.

719
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,549
I THINK YOU SHOULD WEAR
A BLAZER.

720
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,549
OKAY.

721
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,052
ALL RIGHT,
UH, COULD YOU
GET A BLAZER ?

722
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,788
AT LEAST ONE MORE IRAQI DIVISION
HAS ENTERED THE FRAY--

723
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,258
FORTY-FIVE SECONDS
BEFORE WE GET LIVE !

724
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,258
DEX, DEX.

725
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,360
NO TIME.

726
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,360
ALL RIGHT, COME BACK.
WE NEED TO GO OVER YOUR SPEECH.

727
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,796
[ Man ]
ONE THING IS CLEAR, AND THAT IS
THAT THIS IS A LARGE ARMY.

728
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:04,335
EMERSON THE DIPLOMAT,
 EMERSON THE PEACEKEEPER,

729
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,437
EMERSON
THE COOLHEADED.

730
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,240
I HEAR YOU, MARSH.
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

731
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,675
<i> [ Emerson ]
 IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.
 THANK YOU.</i>

732
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,745
- WE'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD--
- BACK AGAINST THE WALL.
  PLEASE BE QUIET DURING THIS.

733
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,681
<i> THE PRESIDENT WILL BE
 ADDRESSING THE NATION.</i>

734
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,681
<i> THERE IS NO TIME DELAY.</i>

735
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,783
WHEN GERALD GOES TO YOU,
START SPEAKING NATURALLY.

736
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,386
RIGHT HERE.
I'LL BE WATCHING THAT.

737
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,455
...FROM A DINER
IN AZTEC, COLORADO.

738
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,925
NICE AND STILL.
WATCH FOR MY CUE.

739
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,925
[ Irving ]  READY ?  VERY GOOD.

740
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,595
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

741
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,532
HERE WE GO.

742
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,532
MY FELLOW AMERICANS,

743
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,870
AS THE WORLD NOW KNOWS,
THE LEADER OF IRAQ,
UDEI HUSSEIN,

744
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:44,841
IN COMPLETE DEFIANCE
OF U.N. RESOLUTIONS
687, 773 AND 883,

745
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,879
HAS INVADED
THE EMIRATE OF KUWAIT
AS HIS FATHER DID IN 1990.

746
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:52,549
IN THE PROCESS,
HE HAS KILLED SEVERAL
HUNDRED AMERICAN TROOPS...

747
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,985
SERVING AS
A PEACEKEEPING FORCE.

748
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,623
OUR INTELLIGENCE
ALSO INDICATES THAT AT LEAST
EIGHT IRAQI DIVISIONS...

749
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,227
ARE HOLDING KUWAIT
AND PROGRESSING TO SAUDI ARABIA.

750
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,564
THIS IS NOT THE ACT
OF A WARRIOR NOR A LEADER...

751
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,733
BUT THAT OF A BARBARIAN.

752
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,304
WE MUST NOW ASSUME THAT
UDEI HUSSEIN'S OBJECTIVE...

753
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,573
IS ONE OF A MANIFEST DESTINY.

754
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,243
AT PRESENT,
NEARLY 80% OF OUR TROOPS...

755
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:22,714
ARE ON THE SEA OF JAPAN
OR THE 38th PARALLEL.

756
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,084
TO PUT IT
AS BLUNTLY AS POSSIBLE,

757
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:29,720
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY...

758
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,125
OF DEALING
WITH THE IRAQI INVASION FORCE
WITH CONVENTIONAL EXPEDITION.

759
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,062
THERE ARE DEFINING MOMENTS
IN THE HISTORY OF EVERY NATION,

760
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:42,165
MOMENTS WHICH DELINEATE
OUR STRENGTHS AND OUR CHARACTER.

761
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:47,671
OFTEN THESE MOMENTS REQUIRE
THAT A HARDER RIGHT BE MADE
OVER AN EASIER WRONG.

762
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:52,810
IT IS WITH THAT IN MIND THAT
I NOW WISH TO SPEAK DIRECTLY
TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE.

763
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,779
UNLESS YOUR LEADER,
UDEI HUSSEIN,

764
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,283
IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWS
FROM HIS POSITION IN KUWAIT,

765
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:02,620
LEAVING ALL WEAPONS BEHIND
WHERE THEY ARE,

766
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,623
AND TURNS HIMSELF IN
FOR ARREST...

767
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,026
AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY
IN KUWAIT,

768
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,161
I WILL AUTHORIZE THE DROPPING...

769
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:14,599
OF A MULTI-MEGATON
NUCLEAR DEVICE
ON THE CITY OF BAGHDAD.

770
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,903
I'M NOW GIVING YOU,
THE CITIZENS OF BAGHDAD,

771
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,773
ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES
TO LEAVE THE CITY,

772
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,074
SAVE YOUR LIVES
AND THOSE OF YOUR CHILDREN.

773
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:30,815
IT IS MY DEEPEST AND MOST
HEARTFELT WISH AND PRAYER...

774
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,518
THAT UDEI HUSSEIN
ACCEPT HIS RESPONSIBILITY...

775
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:39,156
AS THE SOVEREIGN OF A NATION
AND A RESPONSIBLE MEMBER
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

776
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:41,259
THAT IS IT FOR NOW.

777
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,261
GOD SAVE US ALL.

778
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,196
THANK YOU.

779
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,435
OKAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US,

780
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:54,870
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES
HAS JUST GIVEN WHAT MAY BE...

781
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:57,641
THE MOST DRAMATIC SPEECH EVER
GIVEN BY A SITTING PRESIDENT.

782
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:57,641
[ Marsh ]  JESUS.

783
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,077
WHAT ?  WHAT ?

784
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:03,214
WELL, I MEAN,
THAT WASN'T EXACTLY
PEACEMAKING, WAS IT ?

785
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,484
SUBJECTIVE, ISN'T IT ?

786
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,419
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

787
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,290
HE WOULD ORDER
THE DROPPING OF A NUCLEAR BOMB
ON BAGHDAD UNLESS:

788
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,762
ONE, UDEI HUSSEIN WITHDRAWS
AND RETREATS FROM KUWAIT;
TWO--

789
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:20,531
[ Lancaster ]
ACCORDING TO WEATHER INTEL,

790
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,633
NAVIGATING AN AIRCRAFT
TO YOUR POSITION
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

791
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:26,871
WE COULD RISK IT AND TRY
SENDING A HELICOPTER TO YOU.

792
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:26,871
NO, NO, NO, NO.

793
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,706
WE COULD RISK SENDING
A HELICOPTER HERE,

794
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,610
BUT WE CANNOT RISK
PUTTING THE PRESIDENT
ON A HELICOPTER OUT OF HERE.

795
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,780
[ Defense Secretary ]  AGREED.
NORAD HAS DISPATCHED A WINTER
A.P.C. TO YOUR POSITION.

796
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,014
IT SHOULD BE THERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

797
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,014
ALL RIGHT.

798
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:41,552
WHAT WILL MY ABILITY BE
TO COMMUNICATE
ONCE INSIDE THE A.P.C. ?

799
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,423
THERE ARE SHORTWAVES
ON ALL THE A.P.C.s,
HOWEVER THE LINES ARE NONSECURE.

800
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,525
IF THEY'RE NONSECURE,
FORGET IT.  BOTTOM LINE,
WE WORK FROM HERE.

801
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:51,662
MR. PRESIDENT,
ADMIRAL MILLER HERE,
CENTRAL COMMAND.

802
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,365
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU
OFF SPEAKER.

803
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,801
ADMIRAL, HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS
GO HOT IN AN HOUR AND A HALF.

804
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,802
I WILL NOT HOLD
YOUR COMMENTS
AGAINST YOU.

805
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:02,973
OKAY.  SIR, I MUST OBJECT
TO YOUR THREAT ON IBS.

806
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,810
HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS CAN BE
DEALT WITH CONVENTIONALLY.

807
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,478
OUR HIGH-TECH WEAPONS CAN DO
ALL THAT THE NUKES CAN DO--

808
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,478
NO, NO, NO.

809
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:12,482
WE'VE BEEN DOWN
THAT ROAD BEFORE.

810
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:12,482
THAT'S
A GOOD POINT, SIR.

811
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,019
THAT'S NOT A GOOD POINT.  WE'VE
BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD BEFORE.

812
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,019
LISTEN, PEOPLE !

813
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:19,256
LET'S BE CLEAR.
IF WE ATTACK, WE ATTACK,
AND IT'S GONNA BE MAJOR.

814
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,192
I'M NOT GONNA SEND OVER
A COUPLE OF TOMAHAWKS,

815
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,661
AND GET ON THE PHONE AND SAY,
&quot;HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES ?&quot;

816
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,496
IT'S NEVER WORKED BEFORE.
HUSSEIN'S LIKE HIS OLD MAN.
HE'S A SURVIVOR.

817
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:31,802
AFTER EVERY CALAMITY, HE EMERGES
DUSTING OFF HIS UNIFORM ASKING,
&quot;IS THAT IT ?&quot;

818
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:35,039
[ Lancaster ]
EVEN A LIMITED AIR ATTACK
IS AN EXTENSIVE AIR ATTACK.

819
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,374
IT'S NOT 20 OR 50 SORTIES
BUT HUNDREDS.

820
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:39,976
[ Miller ]
WHICH THE<i> U.S.S. POWELL
 CAN'T ACCOMMODATE.</i>

821
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:44,781
RIGHT.  THEN WE'D HAVE
TO MOVE INTO THEIR PLANES,
AIRFIELDS, SAM SITES.

822
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:48,986
[ Miller ]  GRANTED,
BUT EVEN THAT DOESN'T LEAVE US
WITH JUST THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

823
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:53,123
OKAY, OKAY.  BEFORE WE
CARRY OUT THE &quot;SHOULD WE
OR SHOULDN'T WE&quot; DEBATE,

824
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,192
LET'S ENSURE
WHAT WE IN FACT CAN DO.

825
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,728
GENERAL RILEY,
WHAT DO WE HAVE ?

826
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,728
WELL, MR. PRESIDENT,

827
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,696
AT STRATCOM
UNDER START 2,

828
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:03,066
OUR MISSILES ARE NOW SET
ON A TRAJECTORY THAT ENDS
IN THE ATLANTIC.

829
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,535
WHAT BRILLIANT
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
CAME UP WITH THAT ONE ?

830
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,171
HOW LONG TO RESET
THE TARGET ?

831
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,171
OUR RECORD'S 20 MINUTES.

832
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,607
IT USED TO BE SHORTER,
BUT WE DE-ALERTED
FIVE YEARS AGO.

833
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:13,110
<i> [ Emerson ]
 WHAT DO WE HAVE
 IN OUR ARSENAL ?</i>

834
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,146
[ Riley ]
SEVERAL TRIPLE WARHEAD
EXCALIBUR 3 NUCLEAR MISSILES.

835
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,248
- WE COULD HIT OUR DESIGNATED
  TARGETS IN TWO HOURS.
- [ Emerson ]  TWO HOURS ?

836
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:21,552
<i> NO, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
 WE HAVE TO HIT IRAQ BEFORE
 THEIR WEAPONS CAN GO HOT.</i>

837
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,121
HOW THE UNITED STATES
WOULD LAUNCH A NUCLEAR ATTACK,

838
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:28,559
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT MUST BE
INITIATED AND COMPLETED IN LESS
THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF...

839
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,527
IS VERY LIMITING.

840
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:32,362
WE DO HAVE FILE FOOTAGE HERE.

841
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:36,767
THE<i> U.S.S. POWELL</i> IS
OUR ONE AND ONLY WARSHIP
IN THE GULF REGION.

842
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:41,504
THE<i> POWELL</i> IS ONE
OF ONLY TWO SURFACE SHIPS
TO CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS...

843
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:44,775
SINCE PRESIDENT BUSH'S
NUCLEAR BAN INSTITUTED IN 1992.

844
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:48,546
[ Emerson ]
OKAY, WHAT WEAPONS
DO WE HAVE ON THEPOWELL<i> ?</i>

845
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,515
[ Lancaster ]
THE FASTEST DEPLOYMENT
WOULD BE BY TOMAHAWK.

846
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:54,518
DETONATION
IN 40 MINUTES.

847
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:54,518
OKAY, BUT IF WE DO THAT,

848
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:57,454
WE HAVE TO GIVE HUSSEIN
ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLY.

849
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:59,489
WE COULD LAUNCH TOMAHAWKS
45 MINUTES FROM NOW.

850
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:02,626
HE WOULD HAVE THAT TIME
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL 40
TO COMPLY, CORRECT ?

851
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:06,898
[ Miller ]  NOT REALLY.
ONCE THAT MISSILE'S
ON ITS WAY, IT'S ON ITS WAY.

852
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,867
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
TO DIVERT IT, RIGHT ?

853
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,603
[ Lancaster ]
WE CAN DO TWO THINGS...

854
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,905
IF HUSSEIN COMPLIES
WHILE THE MISSILE
IS IN FLIGHT.

855
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,542
FIRSTLY, WE CAN DETONATE.

856
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,542
THEN WE'D HAVE NUCLEAR RAIN
ALL OVER THE DETONATION AREA.

857
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,310
POSSIBLY
A FRIENDLY ONE.

858
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,310
EXACTLY, MA'AM.

859
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,414
WE CAN ALSO
DEACTIVATE THE BOMB.

860
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,849
THE PROBLEM IS THAT, THEN,
WHERE THE BOMB LANDS,
IT LANDS.

861
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:28,619
AND THAT'S LIKE
GIVING HUSSEIN
A FREE NUCLEAR WEAPON.

862
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,355
[ Lancaster ]  SIR,
I'D SAY OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO
ACTUALLY DROP A BOMB ON BAGHDAD.

863
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,358
WE COULD USE OUR B-2s
BASED IN SAUDI.

864
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,360
HOW LONG TO LOAD HER
AND PUT HER UP IN THE AIR ?

865
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,360
ON YOUR ORDERS, SIR.

866
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,497
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THE B-2 CAN BE RECALLED
AT THE LAST SECOND IF NECESSARY.

867
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:42,732
WE CAN STRIKE
WITHIN AN HOUR.

868
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:42,732
THIS IS PROBLEMATIC.

869
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:47,270
THE B-2s WE'D HAVE TO FLY
OVER SAUDI TERRITORY.
WE'D HAVE TO GET PERMISSION.

870
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,740
THIS GUY IS INVADING
THEIR OIL FIELDS.

871
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,975
OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA
GET PERMISSION.

872
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,975
THERE IS NO &quot;OF COURSE.&quot;

873
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:56,280
I KNOW THESE GUYS.

874
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:56,280
SHARING A LITTLE<i> BABA GHANNOUJ
 AT A STATE DINNER...</i>

875
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,348
DOES NOT
MAKE YOU KNOW THEM.

876
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,884
OKAY.  ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA PUT
THE B-2 UP.

877
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,786
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR PROTOCOL.

878
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,556
SIR, IT IS NOT
A MATTER OF PROTOCOL.

879
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,392
IT'S INTERNATIONAL LAW.

880
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,392
UNDERSTOOD.

881
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,428
CONSIDER IT AN ACT
OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.

882
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:17,535
GET ME SECRETARY OF STATE
AND, UH, GIVE ME
A FEW MINUTES, FOLKS.

883
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,848
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
USE SOME COMMON SENSE.
COME ON.

884
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,719
MM-HMM.
SPECIALTY OF THE HOUSE.

885
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,221
OH, WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

886
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,124
BITCH OF A SITUATION
YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR HANDS.

887
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,560
YES.  YES, IT IS.

888
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,998
- IF I WERE YOU--
- EXCUSE ME.  MAY WE HAVE
  A WORD HERE, PLEASE ?

889
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,203
I'LL GET THAT.

890
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,203
OKAY.  WOULD YOU
LIKE SOMETHING ?

891
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,907
NO, I'M FINE.  THANKS.

892
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,410
MR. PRESIDENT,
I WAS THINKING--

893
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,410
GAYLE.

894
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,078
WHAT CAN YOU
TELL ME ABOUT
ADMIRAL MILLER ?

895
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,447
MILLER ?

896
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,447
YES.

897
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,184
DO YOU
KNOW HIM ?

898
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:11,855
HE WAS ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
NOMINEES FOR CHAIR OF THE J.C.S.
TWO YEARS AGO.

899
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,790
HE LOST OUT TO LANCASTER.

900
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,793
HE'S BEEN RUNNING
CENTRAL COMMAND EVER SINCE THEN.

901
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:20,397
SOUTHWEST ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST,
THOSE ARE HIS TERRITORIES,

902
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,833
BUT HE'S BASED IN McDILL,
IN FLORIDA.

903
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,603
THE ARAB COUNTRIES
DON'T WANT US
IN THE GULF AREA.

904
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,105
MY GUESS IS
HE'S PROBABLY FEELING
LIKE A PAPER TIGER.

905
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,907
YEAH, I THINK SO.

906
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,411
THAT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS
THE GIANT CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER.

907
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,547
IT'S A CHIP YOU NEED
RIGHT NOW, SIR.

908
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,016
MADAM CHAIRMAN, WE JUST MIGHT
HAVE TO DROP THAT WEAPON.

909
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:42,853
<i> IF WE DO--</i>

910
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,788
<i> [ Sighing ]</i>

911
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:49,626
YOU KNOW, TRUMAN DEBATED
AGONIZINGLY BEFORE HIROSHIMA.

912
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:52,229
NOT SO MUCH
ABOUT DROPPING THE BOMB...

913
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,298
BUT WHETHER OR NOT TO FOREWARN
THE JAPANESE PEOPLE.

914
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:57,100
<i> WE'D HAVE
 WON THE WAR
 EITHER WAY,</i>

915
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,305
<i> BUT HE WOULD HAVE
 SLEPT BETTER
 THE REST OF HIS LIFE.</i>

916
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:05,375
I'M DETERMINED TO SPARE
AS MANY LIVES AS I CAN,

917
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,379
AND I JUST, FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
CAN'T IMAGINE...

918
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:12,316
HUSSEIN IS GONNA LET
THE CITY OF BAGHDAD DIE.

919
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,652
<i> OUR STRATEGY IS
 TO ROLL THE DICE...</i>

920
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:17,621
<i> THAT HE'LL COMPLY.</i>

921
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:23,627
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR VEGAS METAPHOR, SIR,

922
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,196
NUCLEAR WARFARE
IS NOT ABOUT GAMBLING.

923
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,665
IT'S ABOUT CERTAINTY.

924
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,701
STRATEGIC CERTAINTY.

925
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,770
MORAL CERTAINTY.

926
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,207
<i> SECRETARY CLIFT
 IS ON THE PHONE.</i>

927
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,478
DO I SEEM UNCERTAIN
TO YOU, GAYLE ?

928
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,050
HUSSEIN, FOR EXAMPLE,
COULD WITHHOLD THE OIL FROM US,

929
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,952
OR HE COULD FLOOD
THE WORLD MARKET.

930
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:53,423
IN ANY CASE, HUSSEIN WILL HAVE
THE LEVERAGE TO MANIPULATE
OIL PRICES AT WILL,

931
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,591
AND YOU CAN ASSUME THAT--
WELL, DON'T FORGET, GERALD,

932
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,362
IN 1990, THE ONLY PEOPLE
SMILING WERE THE BOYS
AT EXXON AND SHELL,

933
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:02,132
WHO SAW GAS PRICES
AND STOCKS--

934
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:02,132
DEBRA, WHERE ARE YOU NOW ?

935
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:06,036
<i> I'M ON MY WAY TO STATE.</i>

936
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:06,036
<i> UH-HUH, AND WHAT
 ARE YOU SENSING ?</i>

937
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,804
<i> WELL, I'M NOT
 SENSING SUPPORT.</i>

938
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:10,608
<i> JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY
 IS DEMANDING AN AUDIENCE,</i>

939
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,910
<i> AND ANDREA IN GREECE
 IS GOING TO DEFCON 1.</i>

940
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,080
DEFCON 1 HAS GOT TO BE
THE LIMIT.  IT CANNOT ESCALATE
ONE INCH BEYOND THAT.

941
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,683
UNDERSTOOD.

942
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,683
OKAY, I'M GONNA, UH,

943
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,353
ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
FREEZING ALL KUWAITI ASSETS.

944
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,023
MARSH, WE NEED TO GET ON
WITH TREASURY.

945
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,023
YEAH.

946
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,525
OR IS IT THE A.G. ?

947
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,525
NO, I THINK
IT'S TREASURY.

948
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,594
YEAH.  OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

949
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,594
IT'S TREASURY.

950
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,664
THE OIL LOBBY
IS GONNA GO APE-SHIT.

951
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,664
YEAH, I KNOW,

952
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,667
BUT GET ON WITH NICHOLS
ANYWAYS AND GET THAT
ROLLING ON THE STAT.

953
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,269
I'M SURE HE CAN WORK OFF
MY VERBAL DIRECTIVE FOR NOW.

954
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:42,772
DEBRA, YOU NEED TO GET ON
WITH ANY OTHER FOREIGN NATION
THAT'LL DO THE SAME.

955
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,608
WE NEED TO FREEZE THOSE ASSETS
BEFORE UDEI CAN GET TO THEM.

956
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,944
GOT IT.

957
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,944
OKAY,
AND I NEED GESTAING.

958
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:52,783
MY GUESS IS THAT HE'LL FOLLOW
THE FRENCH PATTERN OF DENYING US
USE OF THEIR AIRSPACE.

959
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,219
GIVE ME SOME TIME.
I THINK I CAN MAKE

WHAT I NEED IS TO SPEAK
WITH GESTAING.

961
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,290
VERY WELL.
AS YOU WILL.

962
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,094
WHAT HAS BEEN MUCH LOUDER--
THIS IS COMING FROM
THE CONGRESSIONAL SIDE--

963
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,163
IS WHAT SEVERAL MEMBERS
OF THE WHITE HOUSE--

964
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,997
EXCUSE ME,
SEVERAL MEMBERS
OF THE HOUSE--

965
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:11,535

A DELIBERATE VIOLATION
OF THE WAR POWERS ACT.

966

969
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,678
MR. PRESIDENT,
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE.

970
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,514
YOU SHOULD NOT NEGOTIATE
WITH AN EMISSARY
FROM ANOTHER HEAD OF STATE.

971
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,717
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THAT
TO GAYLE OR MYSELF.

972
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,717
ABSOLUTELY.

973
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,419
NORMALLY, YES.
DULY NOTED, BUT I
NEED TO DO THIS.

MR. OMARI.  HE'S WITH

ON A MATTER OF GRAVE CONCERN
TO MY GOVERNMENT, MR. EMERSON.

981
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,471
YES, THIS IS VERY GRAVE.

982
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,740
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT HAS CREATED
HAVOC IN OUR STREETS.

WITH YOUNG CHILDREN,

FORGIVE ME,
MR. PRESIDENT,

MR. EMERSON, YOUR THREATS
ARE THE MOST BARBARIC ACT...

1026

AGAINST OUR NATION--
UH, PEACE-LOVING NATION.

I BELIEVE YOUR PEOPLE
TO BE PEACE-LOVING.

1028
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,466

IS CLEARLY IN VIOLATION
OF U.N. RESOLUTIONS.

OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS...

UNCONDITIONALLY...

YOU ARE A, UH,
PUPPET OF ZION.

1052
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,098
YOU ARE NOT AN ELECTED LEADER
OF YOUR NATION.

1053
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,935
I AM THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

1054
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,935
WHEN AN ELECTED LEADER...

1055
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,639
IS IN PLACE,
PERHAPS THEN
WE WILL NEGOTIATE.

1056

INTO IRAQI AIRSPACE--

OTHER THAN PRIMITIVE SYSTEMS
WHICH WE CAN EASILY OVERCOME.

WILL BE OVER BAGHDAD PROPER...

REACHED LAUNCH CAPABILITY.

AND AM CONVINCED...

WILL NOT BE HOT, WE WILL
MAKE GOOD ON MY PROMISE.

I CAN'T MAKE OUT
WHO IT IS
OR WHAT IT IS,

1071
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,949
BUT IT'S SOME KIND
OF ARGUMENT, SIR.

00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,685
OKAY, HE'S BACK.

1073
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:25,087
I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE
WITH A JEW.

1074
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:28,324

AND OBLIGATION...

<i> AND INSTRUCTIONS
 NOT TO NEGOTIATE

1076
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,863

- HE HUNG UP, SIR.
- HE WHAT ?

1078
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,635
HE HUNG UP ?

1079
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,635

1082
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,404
NO, IT WAS
DISTINCT.

1083
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:46,409
DEFINITELY THE SOUND
OF A PHONE SLAMMING DOWN
ON A RECEIVER, SIR.

1084
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,844
[ Redford ]
THAT WAS INEVITABLE.

1085
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:51,281
ISRAEL WILL NOT TIRE
IN ITS DEFENSE,

1086
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,450
AND THE I.D.F. WILL CONTINUE...

1087
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,587
BALANCING BETWEEN
DETERRENCE AND RESTRAINT.

1088
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,123
IT SHOULD NOT
BE AN ISSUE,
AND IT WILL NOT BE.

1089
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,593
I THINK WHAT
GAYLE MEANS IS...

1090
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,593
I KNOW WHAT GAYLE MEANS.

1091
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,662
IT'S ONE THING
IF GEORGE BUSH DROPPED
A BOMB ON AN ARAB COUNTRY.

1092

IT'S WAR.
IF YOU DROP IT, A JEW--

1093
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:10,934
- IT'S JIHAD.
- A HOLY WAR.

1094
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,970
THE PROBLEM
WITH JIHAD IS, YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'VE LOST THE WAR.

1095
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,406
- YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
  WHEN YOU'VE WON IT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1096
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,307
WHEN DO YOU STOP FIGHTING
FOR ALLAH ?

1097
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:22,212
AT LEAST SADDAM WAS SECULAR.
UDEI'S BEEN PLAYING
THE ALLAH CARD FOR YEARS.

1098
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,616
YES.

1099
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,616
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE
TO WIN THIS WAR NOW.

1100
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,850
DROPPING AN ATOM BOMB
ISN'T A WAR, SIR.

1101
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,554
<i> [ Marsh ]
 THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

<i> KATIE, SIT DOWN.</i>

00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,559
ARE YOU FOLLOWING
ANY OF THIS ?

1104
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,559
I THINK SO.

1105

IT IS DIFFICULT
NOT TO.

1106
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,863
YEAH,
I IMAGINE SO.

1107
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,899
MY STAFF HERE THINKS
THAT MY BEING JEWISH...

1108
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,000
MAY AFFECT MY DECISION
ABOUT WHAT TO DO
WITH HUSSEIN AND IRAQ--

1109
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:47,737
THAT I HAVE SOME BIAS,
SOME RACIST--

1110
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:50,240
<i> SIR,
 YOU'RE TAKING THIS
 WAY OUT OF CONTEXT.</i>

1111
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,509
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

1112
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,509
<i> NO.</i>

1113
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,509
<i> WHAT DO YOU THINK ?</i>

1114
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,512
I'M NOT ONE TO SAY.

1115
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,181
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF JEWS IN AZTEC.

1116
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:00,717
I MEAN, SOME MAY PASS BY
IF THEY'RE TRUCKERS,

1117
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,753
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
I CAN'T MAKE A COMMENT...

1118
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:06,889
ON THINGS
HAVING TO DO
WITH JEWS.

1119
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:10,427

01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:18,133
CONVENTIONAL ATTACK, OR NO ?

1447
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:18,133
NOT EVEN THAT
ANYMORE.

1448
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:22,037
I THINK WE MUST
CAREFULLY CONSIDER
WHAT OMARI SAID.

1449
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:24,839
[ Lancaster ]  OUR SATELLITES
HAVE BEEN ON THE LISTED
LONGITUDES AND LATITUDES.

1450
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,742
I SHOULD HAVE
A REPORT IN FIVE MINUTES.

1451
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:31,013
ADMIRAL MILLER, I WANT
THE B-2 TO PROCEED FORWARD
TILL IT REACHES THE BORDER.

1452
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,683
SIR, IN LIGHT
OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT, I MUST
AGREE WITH ADMIRAL MILLER.

1453
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:37,619
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THEY'RE GOING TO FIRE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AT ALL.

1454
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,155
IT'S EVEN LESS LIKELY
NOW THAT ARAB FORCES
ARE MOVING TOWARDS ISRAEL.

1455
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:42,591
THEY'LL BE FIRING
ON THEMSELVES.

1456
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:42,591
EXACTLY.

1457
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:46,895
SO WHY RISK AN INTERNATIONAL
NUCLEAR ATTACK ON SOMETHING THAT
PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN ANYWAY ?

1458
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:49,297
SIR, WE RISK
ALMOST NO CONDEMNATION...

1459
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:52,068
IF WE FIRE ON THEM
USING CONVENTIONALS.

1460
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,938
[ Marsh ]
LOOK, EVEN IF THEY DO
FIRE THOSE WEAPONS--

1461
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,773
LET ME BE FRANK.

1462
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:01,510
IF IT MEANS SACRIFICING
ISRAEL OR TURKEY, SO BE IT,

1463
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:04,880
AS LONG AS WE SAVE
AMERICAN LIVES.

1464
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,583
SOMETIMES THE TOUGHEST DECISIONS
ARE THE ONES WITH ONE OPTION.

1465
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:11,587
UH, EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT YOU
HAVE CREATED A MISTAKE HERE.
YOU'VE CREATED A MONSTER.

1466
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:15,857
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
THAT WE CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS THING METHODICALLY.

1467
01:03:15,857 --> 01:03:20,329
WE TAKE OUT
THEIR CHEMICAL WARHEADS
USING CONVENTIONALS.

1468
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,665
UPON RETURNING
TO THE WHITE HOUSE,
WE DEAL WITH HUSSEIN...

1469
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:26,435

IT'S BAD.  LET ME
GIVE YOU THE LAYOUT.

1473
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,609
OKAY, HOLD ON A SECOND.
HOWARD, YOU GOT A PENCIL ?

1474
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:37,246
I HAVE A RED FELT PEN, SIR,
BUT NO PENCIL.

THERE'S ALSO AN INDICATION

1504

SIR, MR. OMARI
IS BACK ON THE LINE.

1505
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,227
SO MUCH FOR NOT
NEGOTIATING WITH A JEW.

DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.
THEY'RE JUST GONNA SIT BACK
AND TAKE A LICKING.

1602
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,774
SO ONCE WE ARE
IN BAGHDAD AIRSPACE,

1603
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:42,711
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT CAN DETER HIM
FROM HITTING US OR OUR ALLIES.

1604
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,880
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND ?
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ?

1605
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,748
WHAT ARE YOU
TELLING ME ?
TO CAVE IN ?

1606
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:49,451
ABSOLUTELY NOT, SIR.
YOU PRESENT IT
AS HIS CAPITULATION.

1607
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:52,252
HE HAS COME TO YOU WITH THE IDEA
OF PRICE STABILIZATION.

1608
01:09:52,252 --> 01:09:54,723
HEY, WHEN HAS THAT
EVER HAPPENED ?

1609
01:09:52,252 --> 01:09:54,723
<i> [ Marsh ]  NEVER.</i>

1610
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,759
WALT, THIS IS
THE THING.  NEVER.

1611
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:00,795
NOT IN ANY ADMINISTRATION.
THIS WILL BE A FIRST.

1612
01:09:56,759 --> 01:10:00,795
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU'VE SAVED...

1613
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:02,797
THREE COUNTRIES
FROM CHEMICAL ATTACK.

1614
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:07,401
SIR, THE LEVEL OF HEROISM HERE
IS AT LEAST AS HIGH AS THAT
OF KENNEDY IN '62.

1615
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,738
POWELL IN VENEZUELA.

1616
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,738
<i> STOP IT
 RIGHT THERE, SIR.</i>

1617
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,575
<i> I APPRECIATE YOU GOT A JOB
 TO DO, BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE
 A WORD WITH THE MAN.</i>

01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,643
I JUST WANNA
TALK TO HIM.

1619
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,643
NOT NOW, OKAY ?

1620
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,379
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE GIVING ME
THIS STATIC.

1621
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,748
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

1622
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,748
THE MAN
HAS A WEAPON.

1623
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:22,617
I PAY MY TAXES.
 I CAN SPEAK MY MIND.

1624
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,853
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID
IN TAXES LAST YEAR ?

1625
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,853
I CAN UNDERSTAND.

1626
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,323
THREE LARGE.  YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE FOR A GUY LIKE ME ?

1627
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,491
<i> YOU KNOW
 WHAT THAT IS ?</i>

1628
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,491
<i> ALL RIGHT !</i>

1629
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:34,362
- LET'S HEAR
  WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
- YES, SIR.

1630
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,966
KEEP IT
UNDER CONTROL.

1631
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,966
I GOT IT.
THANK YOU.

1632
01:10:38,032 --> 01:10:40,969
THANK YOU.  I PAY
MY TAXES, YOU KNOW ?

1633
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:43,571
YES, I HEARD THAT.

1634
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:47,710
OKAY, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT, SPEAKING FOR
THE COMMON MAN, WE'RE WITH YOU.

THEM MOTHERFUCKERS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

1638
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,252

A LESSON HE AND HIS DADDY
NEVER LEARNED.

1639
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:59,421
KEEP YOUR HANDS AT YOUR SIDES.

1640
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:59,421
YOU DROP THAT BOMB,

1641
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,257
<i> YOU GOT MY VOTE
 AND THE VOTE OF
 EVERY REAL AMERICAN.</i>

1642
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:05,160
MY BUDDY ACE AND I WERE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION
THE OTHER DAY,

1643
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,896
AND ACCIDENTALLY
I LET SLIP
THE WORD &quot;FAG.&quot;

1644
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,798
MY BUDDY GETS
BENT OUT OF SHAPE,

1645
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,267
SAYING, &quot;RALPHIE, BE CAREFUL.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S AROUND.&quot;

1646
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,169
THEN HE TEACHES ME
THIS LITTLE TRICK.

1647
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:17,940
EVERY TIME WE SEE
ONE OF THEM HOMOSEXUALS,
WE USE THE WORD &quot;WATERMELON.&quot;

1648
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,808
<i> YOU SEE A FAG,
 YOU SAY, &quot;WOULDN'T SOME
 WATERMELON BE NICE NOW ?&quot;</i>

1649
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:24,880
I SAID, &quot;GEEZ, ACE,
THAT'S INGENIOUS !
WHAT DO YOU CALL BLACKS ?&quot;

1650
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,615
<i> HE SAYS, &quot;TEXANS.&quot;</i>

1651
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,119
I SAY, &quot;WHAT DO
YOU CALL SPICS ?&quot;
HE SAYS, UH--

1652
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,920
<i> HE SAYS,
 &quot;TRUCKERS.&quot;</i>

1653
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,988
<i> FINALLY, I SAY,
 &quot;WHAT DO YOU CALL
  THEM ARABS ?&quot;</i>

1654
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:37,825

&quot;HELL, RALPH, WE JUST
 CALL THEM SAND NIGGERS.&quot;

1655
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:40,929
<i> SEE WHAT I'M SAYIN' ?
 NOBODY GIVES A SHIT ABOUT
 NO DIRTY-ASS SAND NIGGER.</i>

1656
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,532
AND AS FAR AS THEIR NUKES GO,
THEY'RE SO STONE AGE BACKWARDS,

1657
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,301
THEY PROBABLY NEVER SEEN
A BUTTON, LET ALONE KNOW
HOW TO PUSH ONE.

1658
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:49,771
RALPH, IS IT ?

1659
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:49,771
<i> YEAH.</i>

IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE ?

1663
01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,381
NO, THAT ABOUT COVERS IT.

1664

OKAY.  HOW 'BOUT,

<i> MR. PRESIDENT,

YOU DON'T KNOW IS--

1681
01:12:42,557 --> 01:12:46,995
I MEAN, THE THING OF IT IS,
THESE ARE AMERICAN-MADE WEAPONS.

1682

AMERICAN-MADE ?

1683
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:50,065
YES, SIR.

1685
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:54,402
NO, NOT ARMS DEALERS.
THE MARKINGS ARE CLEAR.

1686
01:12:54,402 --> 01:12:56,437
THESE WEAPONS
WERE FRENCH PROPERTY.

THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ?

1688
01:12:56,437 --> 01:13:00,175
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN, MR. THOMPSON.

BEEN HIS MOST HEROIC ACT.

WELL, NOW THAT EVERYONE
KNOWS WHERE THEY'RE FROM,

1728
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:24,025
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO EXPLAIN IT
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1729

TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

1730

THIS POSITION ALL THESE YEARS.

SOME SUBMARINES ?

OF THESE WEAPONS ?

YOU WERE NEVER ELECTED.

1968

YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE
THE SHALLOW ARGUMENT YOU HAVE
A MANDATE OF THE PEOPLE.

1969

OVERLY CONCERNED
ABOUT THOSE CITIES, SIR.

OVER BAGHDAD.

2087
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:06,667
WE CANNOT CLARIFY
THE NATURE OF THIS EXPLOSION.

THAT, IN FACT,
A NUCLEAR WEAPON
HAS BEEN DROPPED...

POINT OUT THAT NORAD...

MY FELLOW AMERICANS.

2158
01:33:43,216 --> 01:33:47,655
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ONCE SAID,
&quot;WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
 BUT FEAR ITSELF.&quot;

IN THE EARLY '90s,
THE UNITED STATES...

2178
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,556
CREATED
THE TERAFLOP COMPUTER,

<i> OF NUCLEAR DETONATION

WHICH CAN LITERALLY PERFORM
ONE TRILLION CALCULATIONS
PER SECOND,

2183

2185
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:13,841
WE BEGAN TO SELL

2186
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:15,943
<i> OUR MOTIVATION
 WAS SIMPLE.</i>

2187

<i> THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
 HUSSEIN FROM BUILDING
 A NUCLEAR ARSENAL...</i>

2188

<i> WAS TO SUPPLY HIM
 WITH ONE, AND WE DID
 THROUGH AN EMISSARY.</i>

2189

<i> THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
 SUPPLIED IRAQ WITH AS MANY

<i> AS THEY WOULD EVER NEED
 AND A TERAFLOP COMPUTER

<i> AS SOME OF YOU
 MAY HAVE GUESSED,</i>

NOT ONE OF
THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS WE SOLD IRAQ
THROUGH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT...

2194
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:43,770
EVER HAD THE CAPACITY
TO DETONATE, THOUGH THE TERAFLOP
COMPUTER THEY RECEIVED...

2195
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,839
ASSURED THEM THAT THEY WOULD.

<i> THROUGHOUT MODERN HISTORY,
 IT WAS BELIEVED THAT
 THE NUCLEAR ERA DE FACTO...</i>
