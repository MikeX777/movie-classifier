1
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,341
It's too hot.

2
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,809
When I get back,
I'm gonna put it...

3
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,549
Mother?

4
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,109
Mother's the oldest
in our squad.

5
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:38,056
He just had his 26th birthday, and
two days later his baby was born dead.

6
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,060
We call him Mother... Wilkins...

7
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,426
because he's always hounding us
for being sloppy, bugging us...

8
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,431
about leaving things around.

9
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:02,942
They're a little bent.

10
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,818
You want me
to turn you in, Vance?

11
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,755
Between the stuff you did
and the stuff I make up...

12
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:21,700
I could at least get you
to a psychiatrist in some hospital.

13
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,602
Couldn't fool anybody.

14
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,471
Wouldn't let me do
all this shit.

15
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,684
Only you were here.

16
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,755
Doesn't really count.

17
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:46,921
You sure fooled me, Mother.
I'll tell you that.

18
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:51,194
You also broke a squad rule.

19
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,926
What rule?

20
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,934
Well, you said "shit."

21
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,765
What would Father say?

22
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,140
Father Mundy invented our squad
"no obscenity"rule.

23
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,150
We wanna make it clear
we're not actually part of this army.

24
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:15,182
Yes, we have a squad father too.

25
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,417
Mother Wilkins, Father Mundy.

26
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,991
Father Mundy was gonna be a priest,
but never made it through the seminary.

27
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,595
The next guard was taken by Bud Miller,
our mad mechanical genius...

28
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,935
and resident wit...

29
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:36,807
and Stan Shutzer,
our avengingJewish angel.

30
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:42,744
They're supposed to be 12 in
Intelligence and Reconnaissance squads.

31
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:45,012
Ours is down to six.

32
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:48,655
Mel Avakian,
our best remaining soldier...

33
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,750
became corporal to our squad
at the same time I made sergeant.

34
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,988
It wasn't
for anything we did.

35
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,030
Except stay alive.

36
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:00,465
He hasn't sewn on
his stripes either.

37
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,197
Our regimental commander
is Major Griffin.

38
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,833
Griffin was a mortician
in civilian life.

39
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,104
His main passion now
seems to be generating business...

40
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,509
for his army counterparts.

41
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,140
It's thanks to Griffin
and his military mortuary skills...

42
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:18,652
that I've made my recent
headlong leap to three stripes.

43
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:22,382
We lost half our squad, attempting one
of his map-inspired, ill-conceived...

44
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:24,549
recon patrols.

45
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,423
When I say "lost,"
I mean "killed."

46
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,828
Nobody in the army ever admits
that someone on our side is killed.

47
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:33,628
They're either lost,
like Christopher Robin...

48
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:40,367
hit, as in a batter
hit by a pitched ball...

49
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:45,140
or they get "it"
like in hide-and-go-seek.

50
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:48,375
Or maybe they get it
as with an ambiguous joke.

51
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:54,112
Not one of the six killed
had an army intelligence score...

52
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,849
of less than 150.

53
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,914
We gained a few miles
of European real estate...

54
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:02,053
and lost the beginnings to untold
generations of very bright people.

55
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,723
I think the army
considered this a good deal.

56
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,864
So now we've been moved north
into the Ardennes Forest...

57
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,875
to await replacements.

58
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:17,968
It's become a kind
of frontline halfway house...

59
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,979
for straightening out
our nerves.

60
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,950
I'm not sure
I can be straightened out.

61
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,445
I'm scared all the time now.

62
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,428
It's mid-December, 1944.

63
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,199
My family name is Knott.
K-N-O-T-T.

64
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,799
My parents named me William.

65
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:52,971
By the third grade,
I was Will Knott.

66
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,981
I've learned to live with it.

67
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:57,882
What I wasn't prepared for
were the guys of the I & Rplatoon...

68
00:07:57,952 --> 00:08:00,819
who decided I was
to be known as "Won't."

69
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,624
Let's go, Knott!

70
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:11,095
Back in Camp Shelby
before we shipped out...

71
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:15,329
Lieutenant Ware was told that
Intelligence was doing a lousy job.

72
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,099
He figured if he filled the squad
with intelligent soldiers...

73
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,402
he'd get better Intelligence.

74
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,807
He searched the regimental records for
the soldiers with the highest scores...

75
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,812
on the intelligence test...

76
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,610
and requisitioned us
as a squad.

77
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,742
Of course, six of us are dead.

78
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,778
So what's intelligence?

79
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,515
Jesus Christ, Knott.

80
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,357
Haven't you got them fucking
sergeant stripes sewn on yet?

81
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,331
The supply sergeant says they're all
out. They're waiting on a new shipment.

82
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,924
Well, get some staff sergeant
stripes and cut 'em down.

83
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,864
That'd be destruction
of government property, sir.

84
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:56,505
Well, I just hope to hell that
son of a bitch Griffin doesn't see it.

85
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,944
It's amazing how much profanity
goes on in the army...

86
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,346
when you're tuned to hear it.

87
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,591
Yeah, at ease, gentlemen.

88
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,889
Well done.
And, Corporal, if we could...

89
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,895
I'd like the water
a little warmer tomorrow.

90
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,330
Give that razor a fighting chance
up there against the whiskers.

91
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,801
Okay. Lieutenant Ware,
Sergeant Knott.

92
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,771
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to disregard...

93
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,365
all the rumors you've been
hearing around camp lately...

94
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,536
because now there's talk
of a imminent all-out enemy offensive.

95
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:36,049
Of course, the natural route for
any such offensive in this sector...

96
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,178
would obviously be
up these two roads...

97
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,586
and through this path
in the forest.

98
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:48,185
With that in mind,
three days ago, I sent out a patrol.

99
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:51,789
Now, that patrol
has not returned...

100
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,131
and, unfortunately,
they have not reported back.

101
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,902
Accordingly, I've made
the following decisions.

102
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,771
Sergeant Knott...

103
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:05,243
at this particular clearing
in the forest...

104
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,439
is a house.

105
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:11,007
I'd like you to move into that house
with your reduced squad.

106
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,179
Take yourself two jeeps
and a week's rations.

107
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,722
And from that house...

108
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,692
you're to report on any and all
enemy activity within that sector.

109
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,695
Lieutenant Ware...

110
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:25,061
you're to maintain constant
radio contact with Sergeant Knott.

111
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,965
- Is that clear, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:31,903
Sir, is there any evidence
of enemy occupation at that house?

113
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,566
Well, now, Sergeant Knott...

114
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,975
that's something you're just
gonna have to find out, isn't it?

115
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,314
Right, sir.

116
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,641
We drive for hours
through the snow.

117
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:13,242
Mother and I haven't talked about our
cross-country jaunt through the woods.

118
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,839
He just acts
as if it never happened.

119
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,579
That's all right. Just thinking
about something like that scares me.

120
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:33,323
What's going on, Mother?

121
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,766
I don't know.
There's something up the road.

122
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,169
- What is it?
- You can't see it from here.

123
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,974
All right, stay here.

124
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,667
What is it?

125
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,679
Miller.

126
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,556
Check it out.

127
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,149
Why do I always have
to check it out?

128
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,742
Jimmy Brunowski
from Griffin's patrol.

129
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,210
Looks like
he finally found a date.

130
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,563
I don't get it.

131
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,674
What's going on?

132
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:59,669
Those filthy, Nazi...

133
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:03,649
Kraut-headed
motherfucking bastards!

134
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,525
Give me a hand.

135
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,022
May God have mercy
on your souls.

136
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,605
I don't see anything.
No smoke, no movement.

137
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,877
What do you think?
Head on up with the jeeps?

138
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,920
Actually, I thought
maybe shoot through an eye.

139
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,855
We head down the road a ways,
circle around the back...

140
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,518
then come down the front of the road
and check for mines.

141
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,789
Is that okay with you?

142
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:58,832
- Yeah. We'll cover you.
- Great.

143
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,891
If Mel hadn't gotten trench foot,
he'd sure as hell be squad leader.

144
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,903
And that's the way
it should be.

145
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,905
Or maybe he'd be dead.

146
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,693
I'm not exactly sure
what country we're in.

147
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,537
It could be Belgium,
Luxembourg, France or even Germany.

148
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:19,006
I don't know what day it is. I have no
watch, so I don't know what time it is.

149
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,946
I'm not even sure of my name.

150
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,745
The next thing you know,
they'll be making me a general.

151
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,062
We find four mattresses
and satin-quilted covers...

152
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,588
along with some wine
and cases of sardines.

153
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,192
The I & Rplatoon,
or what's left of it...

154
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,397
will be living in luxury
for a few days.

155
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,307
Wow. Sheets and pillows.
I haven't had that since home.

156
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,108
Mel, come on.
Show 'em how we did it for the old USO.

157
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,118
USO, huh?

158
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,685
They call it
theJersey Bounce

159
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:44,390
The rhythm
that really counts

160
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:48,926
The temperature
always mounts

161
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,403
Whenever they play that crazy rhythm
they play

162
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:56,966
It started onJournal Square

163
00:18:57,044 --> 00:19:00,207
Somebody heard it there

164
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,283
They put it
right on the air

165
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:09,354
And now you hear it
everywhere

166
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,288
Uptown

167
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,622
Back at Camp Shelby,
when we finally realized...

168
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,891
they really were going
to ship us overseas...

169
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,897
we went into a mild
state of panic.

170
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:21,229
The thing that
bothered us most was that...

171
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,397
with the exception of Mother Wilkins,
we were all eleven virgins.

172
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,406
I don't know
if this was normal...

173
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:31,604
or if there's some sort of correlation
between a lack of sexual precocity...

174
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:33,942
and what is known as intelligence.

175
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:44,051
I think Shutzer came up with the idea.
Or maybe it was Eddie.

176
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:46,592
Eddie was the youngest
of all of us.

177
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,185
Four of us managed a weekend pass
and headed into town...

178
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,595
to find a nice, complacent whore
who could put us out of our misery.

179
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,607
We kept it to four. We figured any more
would be some kind of gang bang.

180
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:05,634
And, well, we had
more romantic aspirations.

181
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,977
We had fifty dollars.
We spent ten on the room...

182
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,883
and left the rest
for the investment.

183
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:16,047
There was much discussion
as to the kind of woman.

184
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:19,251
I think we were all scared
that we'd end up with a real woman...

185
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:21,260
and not be able to manage it.

186
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:23,762
And the "B"girls
in the bars were out.

187
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,663
We were well-conditioned
by the army VD films.

188
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:30,802
Avakian and Shutzer
were to handle the search.

189
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:34,339
Eddie and I waited.

190
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:45,917
What time is it?

191
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,887
- One.
- You're kidding.

192
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,602
We got company, guys.

193
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,373
Oh, shit.

194
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:15,114
I know right then I won't
be able to do it. I'm glad I'm third.

195
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,067
So we'd just about given up...

196
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,603
when we see this girl
down by the bus station.

197
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,265
Just sitting there
on one of those wooden benches.

198
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,935
Anyway, we got around to talking
about what we'd been doing all night.

199
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,001
And right then,
out of the blue...

200
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,980
she just volunteered
to come back here with us.

201
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,985
I thought she was kidding,
but she's serious.

202
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,988
Well, I got an extra rubber
you can use if you want, Stan.

203
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,990
I got my own rubbers.

204
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,788
You've gotten as bad
as Mother Wilkins.

205
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,795
Actually, I can use one.

206
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:13,867
I should have known Edward
was gonna take forever.

207
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:23,174
What the fuck
are they doing in there?

208
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,219
Watch your language, Stan.
What would Father Mundy think?

209
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,220
Fuck Father Mundy.

210
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,924
Hey, Eddie,
how you doing in there, huh?

211
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,723
Maybe she rolled him
or something.

212
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,198
Knockout drops
or a blackjack.

213
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,577
Would you at least
say something?

214
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,681
Her name's Janice.

215
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:35,186
She was engaged
to a boy named Matt.

216
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:40,488
She found out last week that he was
killed in the invasion of Sicily.

217
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:46,554
She came down to Shelby
to get his stuff...

218
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,534
and decided to kill herself.

219
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:54,173
But she couldn't
work up the nerve.

220
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,368
All she has now is a bus ticket
back home to Pittsburgh.

221
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:12,887
Janice has only made love
to one boy, Matt, just before he left.

222
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:17,027
Now she's volunteering herself
to all of us...

223
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:19,531
insisting it's what
she wants to do.

224
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,634
Of course
we're so guilty and scared...

225
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,500
we end up subjecting
this simple, lovely idea...

226
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:29,872
to every kind
of spurious rationale.

227
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:35,748
We wind down before dawn
and sleep.

228
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:41,719
Then just before the morning,
Janice comes quietly...

229
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:43,722
privately to each of us.

230
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,501
We pass through
the mythical barrier...

231
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,197
between boys and men...

232
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:35,070
men and death.

233
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:37,075
Janice takes us with her.

234
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,781
After a luxurious
mass breakfast in bed...

235
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,580
we walk Janice to her bus.

236
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:48,644
None of us talk
about what happened.

237
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:53,884
And I think I'll always feel strange
about my first sexual experience...

238
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,952
masquerading as a dead boy
named Matt.

239
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,369
- Knott.
- Yeah.

240
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,469
I'll cook lunch if you can get me
some wood for the fireplace.

241
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:16,276
No, Mother. All we need
is a bunch of smoke...

242
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,283
to let the Germans
know we're here.

243
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:21,013
Will, if we don't light a fire,
we're gonna freeze our butts off.

244
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,488
And it's very hard to kill Germans
with a frozen butt.

245
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,428
All right.

246
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:03,221
The smoke's bad,
but not as bad as I thought.

247
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,439
You're taking a little long putting
that back together, aren't you, Bud?

248
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,448
I'm not working
for speed right now.

249
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,450
This wine tastes
like sardines.

250
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:30,689
Well, here. The sardines
taste sort of like wine.

251
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,557
I sit here trying
to work out four bridge hands.

252
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:40,992
Miller invented the game, calling it
"compact, cardless, duplicate bridge."

253
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:52,438
When we lost half the squad,
we also lost our only deck of cards.

254
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:54,446
They were on Eddie.

255
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,340
He died in the field hospital.

256
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,980
With his left arm gone
and his face the way it was...

257
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,490
I don't think he tried
very hard to stay on.

258
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,521
Hi, Bud.

259
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:14,625
Did Mother and Avakian
set up all right down there?

260
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:16,753
They seemed fine to me.

261
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:20,560
Good. Listen. You have got to be more
careful lighting cigarettes, all right?

262
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,727
Some German could sneak up from
behind you, pop one in your head...

263
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,896
while you're pretending
to be Walt Whitman.

264
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:30,599
I think my eyeball's frozen.

265
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,783
- Yeah?
- Is that you, Will?

266
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:42,981
- Yeah. What's going on?
- I don't know. I think I saw something.

267
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:46,025
- What did you see, Mother?
- I'm not sure, Will.

268
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:51,628
I don't know. I think I saw something
move on the hill across from us.

269
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:54,030
Did Avakian see it?

270
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,432
No. Just me.

271
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,596
All right, Mother, hang tight.
I'll call up top.

272
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,606
Oh, shit.

273
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,702
- Father?
- Yeah?

274
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,941
Yeah. Mother says he saw something
on the opposite hill there.

275
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,882
- Did you see anything?
- No. Nothing.

276
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:15,409
Wilkins must have eyes like an owl.
I can't see my hand in front of my face.

277
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:18,924
All right.
Could be he's only jumpy.

278
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,357
Just keep an eye
on their backs, all right?

279
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:24,021
Okay, Will.

280
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:26,531
Hey, Bud. Relax. Relax.

281
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,501
Mother's pretty nervous.
It's probably nothing.

282
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,529
Probably nothing?
That's real reassuring, Will.

283
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,942
Well, what do you think?

284
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,536
I don't know.

285
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:44,879
Maybe I should tell them
about Mother's run through the woods.

286
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,613
The news of his baby being dead
did him in for sure.

287
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:06,460
- Yeah?
- We're hearing something down here.

288
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,973
Mother thinks it's the Germans
signaling back and forth.

289
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,509
All right, Mel, hold on.
We'll be right down.

290
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,807
- Bud. Bud, wake up.
- What?

291
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,713
Listen. Mel says he's
hearing some noises, all right?

292
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:20,241
I want you to call Shutzer, tell him
I'm going down to the lower post.

293
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,686
Then call Mother and Avakian back and
remind them not to shoot me, all right?

294
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,155
Come on. Get up.

295
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:30,228
Go!

296
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,671
Did you hear any more?

297
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:44,676
Not since the last one.

298
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,786
It's closer that time.

299
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,320
Americana.

300
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,889
Easy, Mother. Easy.

301
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:03,919
What do you think?
Maybe they're gone?

302
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,793
I don't know.

303
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,557
Maybe they're
just being quiet.

304
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:21,665
Mel.

305
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:24,505
Let's you and me go
check out the road, all right?

306
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:29,173
Hey, Will, you go if you want.
I'm fine right here.

307
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,478
If they're gone, they're gone.

308
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,485
If they're not,
I'm not walking into an ambush.

309
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,353
Put that pin
back in that grenade.

310
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,870
- No, it wasn't.
- They do shit like this all the time.

311
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:59,605
- I know, but that wasn't the case.
- How do you know?

312
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,943
Do you think
it was five of'em?

313
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:10,251
- Yeah, yeah.
- What the hell is going on?

314
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:13,224
Mel said they were actually talking
to you. What did they say?

315
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:17,729
I don't know. First it was,
"Hey, Americana."

316
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:21,130
Then when they left, they started
saying something like "slap guder."

317
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,103
It didn't make any sense.

318
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:32,410
Shit, that's Yiddish.
It's schlaf gut.

319
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:34,412
It's "sleep well."

320
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,281
"Sleep well"?

321
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,683
Yeah, Will. "Sleep well."
Get it?

322
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:45,747
Holy shit. These fucking Nazis.
They're softening us up for the kill.

323
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,866
Will, wake up.

324
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:59,597
Ware's on the phone.
He doesn't sound real happy.

325
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:12,377
- Is Mother out there alone?
- Yeah.

326
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:15,113
- Why?
- Why? It's the day.

327
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:18,122
You don't need to leave two guys out
there during the day. What's the point?

328
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,181
I don't know, Bud.
How about the Germans?

329
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:22,454
What do you want, Will?
You wanna lose one guy, two guys?

330
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:27,329
I'm just really glad we talked about
this. I'm glad we could work this out.

331
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,833
Shit.

332
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:32,729
It's up to you, Bud.
Bid or pass?

333
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,739
I pass.

334
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:37,105
Able 1 to Able 4. Over.

335
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:44,440
I tell Ware about our nighttime
encounter with the Germans.

336
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,007
Bad idea.

337
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,019
Griffin's desperate
for information...

338
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:51,386
so Ware orders us out
to find their command post.

339
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,391
We decided to head south
down the pass.

340
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:56,656
It's as good a guess as any, and that's
where their voices seem to come from.

341
00:35:57,296 --> 00:36:00,697
Of course that could be seen as a good
argument for heading the other way.

342
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,842
I'm having my usual trouble...

343
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:17,440
noticing how beautiful the world is
just when I might be leaving it.

344
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,680
Just this side of the road.

345
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,198
Don't worry.

346
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,801
I'm just enjoying having
a fucking Nazi in my sights.

347
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:22,947
I think I'm getting a hard-on.

348
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:28,519
Pow!

349
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:48,835
I know we could've killed
those three guys and gotten away.

350
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:52,844
I'm also sure they could've done
the same thing to us last night.

351
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:57,949
What I don't know in both cases
is why it didn't happen.

352
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:37,814
Shit!

353
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,791
Fuck! Here we fucking go!

354
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:46,526
You're gonna get us killed here.
You got to relax.

355
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,502
I said you got to relax.
You gotta shut up. You gotta shut up.

356
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,301
- Shut up, Stan!
- You're gonna get us all killed.

357
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,172
You're gonna get us all killed.
You gotta shut up!

358
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,303
Stan! You gotta...

359
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,811
Come on!

360
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,723
What happened?

361
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,522
- You find any Germans?
- Yeah, we found them all right.

362
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,623
And they found us.
Krauts nearly blew our heads off.

363
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,002
Oh, shit.

364
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:01,005
I lost the scope and the map.

365
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,735
Great. Injury to insult.

366
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:06,710
- What happened, Bud?
- What happened?

367
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,747
Germans found us,
had a dead in their sights.

368
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:11,749
They could've killed all of us
and they just let us go.

369
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:16,516
- That's what happened.
- They had you and then they let you go?

370
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,522
What are you complaining about?
You should be happy.

371
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,491
We should be happy?

372
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:24,825
Oh, okay, Mundy, we're happy.

373
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:28,094
We're happy! Yippee!
Hooray!

374
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,499
You feel better now?

375
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:32,503
All right, Stan, come on.

376
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,871
- What the hell is that?
- That's just Mother.

377
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:44,882
Clumping around in the attic again.
It's fine.

378
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:59,162
- Did you find the stuff?
- They must've come back after we left.

379
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:02,723
There's all kind of tracks.
They took the scope and the map.

380
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:15,172
What did you do? Crawl around
on your hands and knees looking for it?

381
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:19,115
No. I could see right off
the stuff wasn't there.

382
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:23,780
I got wet working out a little
surprise for our Teutonic friends.

383
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,847
What, a trap?

384
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,661
I built a snowman.

385
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,362
Right where
we dropped our stuff.

386
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,560
I used pine needles
for a mustache.

387
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:40,127
And then a branch,
like an arm giving the Nazi salute.

388
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:43,732
I even put a few
pine branches over one eye.

389
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,243
- It's not a bad resemblance.
- Jesus, Stan.

390
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:49,508
They could've come up from behind, made
a few well placed critical comments...

391
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,515
and one more
ventilated whiz kid.

392
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,785
Even stamped out a message
in front of my snowman.

393
00:41:58,857 --> 00:42:00,415
What?

394
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:03,290
F-U-C-K...

395
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:07,128
H-l-T-L-E-R.

396
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:11,029
Made exclamation points
with pine branches.

397
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:35,217
- Where's Mother?
- He's upstairs in his attic.

398
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:39,929
- What's he doing there?
- I have no idea, Will.

399
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,462
Actually, he's been kind
of quiet lately.

400
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:47,562
Maybe he hung himself,
huh, Father?

401
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,915
Are you all right, Mother?

402
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:39,290
Look at the paintings, Will.

403
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,228
Look.

404
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:53,963
See?

405
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,741
Somebody cared.

406
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:04,907
Somebody made something...

407
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:10,286
probably not even for money.

408
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:14,592
For love.

409
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:20,821
Sometimes I didn't believe
there was any love left.

410
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:30,573
Try to remember
who the real enemy is, Will.

411
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:57,891
Christ, I thought we lost
both of you up there.

412
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,165
What did you do,
start a family?

413
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,364
Father, you're on next.

414
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,069
Unless anyone objects, Bud...

415
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:08,806
I think we should go back to at least
two on the lower post for now.

416
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,814
All right?

417
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:14,349
It's too weird out there
for one guy alone.

418
00:45:54,393 --> 00:45:55,883
Shit!

419
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:10,107
What the hell's going on?

420
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,372
The explosion was me throwing a grenade.
They haven't fired back yet.

421
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:20,379
Can you hear that?

422
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:23,954
Can you hear that?

423
00:46:24,022 --> 00:46:27,253
We can hear without the phone.
What are they yelling about now?

424
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,489
I think they're yelling "Fuck Hitler"
the way your grandmother would say it.

425
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:34,589
There's this crazy guy in the cemetery,
pretending grenades don't hurt.

426
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,634
Maybe you should send out
some straitjackets.

427
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:37,634
Grenade!

428
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:18,402
Shit.

429
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:42,228
- We're having a snowball fight.
- What?

430
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,701
You don't think maybe the war's over
and they're not telling us, do you?

431
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,137
- I mean, they wouldn't do that.
- You sure you're okay down there?

432
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:52,108
Goddamn it, Shutzer! You're the one
that started this "Fuck Hitler" shit.

433
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:02,019
Schlaf gut, Kraut.

434
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:43,154
You got that map?

435
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:45,662
Yeah.

436
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,641
I'll be a son of a bitch.

437
00:49:05,717 --> 00:49:07,241
What?

438
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,311
I've been trying to figure out all
this crazy shit that's been going on...

439
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:13,653
for the past couple of days,
and only one answer makes sense.

440
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,858
Remember the frozen American
and the Kraut dancing together?

441
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:22,456
See, it's like a message.
They wanna get together.

442
00:49:22,534 --> 00:49:25,196
- It's crude, but remember who they are.
- So?

443
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,569
So then they come around with that
schlaf gut bit the first night.

444
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,835
It's like they're saying
they know that we're here...

445
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,843
but they're not
so mad about it.

446
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,147
- Yeah.
- Well, listen.

447
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:42,346
Okay. Just try to think of one reason
they didn't mow us down...

448
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,685
or at least take us prisoner.

449
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:48,225
I think they're telling us
that they wanna talk...

450
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,318
maybe even surrender.

451
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,459
- What?
- If I'm right...

452
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,763
they want us to meet them
in this clearing at 1200 hours.

453
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:58,564
What if it's a trap?

454
00:49:58,637 --> 00:50:01,003
If they wanted to kill us,
they could've done it a couple of times.

455
00:50:01,072 --> 00:50:04,940
We could've shot them. We didn't.
That doesn't mean we wanna surrender.

456
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,944
They could be stalling
for reinforcements.

457
00:50:07,012 --> 00:50:08,980
With a snowball fight?

458
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,981
A snowball fight
doesn't mean surrender.

459
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,313
Yeah, but look at this.

460
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,255
- I'll mention it to Ware.
- Come on, Won't.

461
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:22,987
We don't wanna get officers involved
in this, screwing everything up.

462
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,656
You know,
I think we got a chance...

463
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:28,858
to make something good
come out of this for everybody...

464
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:31,664
if we just use our heads.

465
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:35,035
What do you say we just go out there
and see what's going on?

466
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,438
Just the two of us.
I'll take all the risks.

467
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:42,469
- I still say I should call Ware first.
- What do you think Ware is gonna do?

468
00:50:42,547 --> 00:50:44,742
- He'll tell Griffin.
- And you know damn well...

469
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:46,943
that Griffin is gonna come charging
out here and arrange everything...

470
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:49,486
so he looks like General Patton
winning the war single-handed.

471
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:52,648
That's the way it is, Stan. There's
nothing we're gonna do about that.

472
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:18,677
Suppose that one of us captures all
the Germans single-handed, all alone...

473
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:22,875
then we build this guy
into a second Sergeant York?

474
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:26,214
It's got to be worth
at least a Silver Star.

475
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:29,619
Maybe even a trip home
as a returning war hero.

476
00:51:29,689 --> 00:51:32,249
- How does that sound?
- Sounds like a court-martial.

477
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:34,623
How are they ever
gonna catch on?

478
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:37,925
You know, for Mother's sake,
I think we should at least try.

479
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:39,828
For Mother?

480
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:42,459
Sure. Who else?

481
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:47,906
Oh, boy, that would be perfect.

482
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:54,872
We testify that the Germans
had us pinned down...

483
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,644
and Wilkins comes in the nick
of time and saves the whole show.

484
00:51:57,717 --> 00:52:01,847
And we'd have a genuine mob
of enemy soldiers to back up our story.

485
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:04,651
Yeah, okay. For right now
we don't tell anybody, okay?

486
00:52:04,724 --> 00:52:06,851
It's just the two of us.

487
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:10,589
Look, if it doesn't work,
at least we tried.

488
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:15,932
Sneaking out is easy.

489
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:17,993
Mother's back upstairs
by himself...

490
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,437
and Father and Miller
are asleep.

491
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:24,603
We decide we'll have to tell Avakian,
who's on guard at the lower post.

492
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:27,237
You're gonna tromp out there,
set up an armistice conference...

493
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:29,281
and turn Wilkins
into a war hero.

494
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,283
What, are you
out of your tiny minds?

495
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:34,081
- I don't think so.
- It all makes sense.

496
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:38,614
It's a theory. You're gonna get
your butt shot off for a theory.

497
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,886
Well, I'm going.

498
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,487
Will, listen to me.
I'm the one guy here who knows...

499
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:46,657
Mel, I said I'm going.

500
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:53,696
Okay, fine.

501
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:58,433
But even if you do
pull this off...

502
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:00,706
how are you going to get
Mother to go along with it?

503
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:07,077
- We tell him?
- No. No, he's right.

504
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:09,986
We'll have to draw straws
or something and rig it.

505
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:12,581
Wilkins will never accept it
if he thinks it's charity.

506
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:15,594
Plus, you tell him,
he's gonna want to tag along.

507
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:18,563
I don't think you want Mother
facing any Germans.

508
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:25,260
So what do you think, Sarge?

509
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:30,602
It's then I tell them about Mother's run
through the forest back at headquarters.

510
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:35,113
I don't think
we should tell him.

511
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:37,342
Okay, look, when we go
to get the Krauts...

512
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,578
we'll leave Wilkins here to guard
the chateau and mind the radio.

513
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:43,816
- It's all gonna seem perfectly natural.
- What makes you so sure this will work?

514
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,120
What makes you
so sure it's not?

515
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,925
Okay, fine.

516
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,797
Give two quick shots and one more
if you need any help.

517
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,928
Then what?

518
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,665
Then I'll miss you.

519
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:16,217
Hey, have fun, boys.
Don't get killed.

520
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:12,974
Hey, just calm down!

521
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:52,079
They want to talk
to our officer in charge.

522
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:55,120
- I don't speak German or Yiddish.
- It's okay. I'll translate.

523
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:57,486
I don't have stripes on my arm.
They won't believe I'm an officer.

524
00:55:57,557 --> 00:56:00,048
I just don't think they're very happy
about surrendering to a Jew, okay?

525
00:56:00,126 --> 00:56:02,185
Did they say
they want to surrender?

526
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:04,695
Just stuff about wanting
to talk to our officer in charge.

527
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:08,599
- What was all the yelling about?
- I'm not sure.

528
00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:11,364
- You're not sure?
- Look!

529
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:13,405
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

530
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,809
Look, just...
Just come over with me.

531
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:23,212
I'll tell them our officer's
back at the chateau.

532
00:56:23,282 --> 00:56:27,048
You look goy enough. Maybe they'll
come out more with you around.

533
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,054
Okay? Come on.

534
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:39,654
This is, uh, meine friend.
Freund.

535
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:46,294
He's in the "schtieb,"
you know?

536
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:20,938
Okay, I think I got it.
There's seven of them.

537
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,498
They just got sent back
from the Russian front...

538
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:26,067
where it sounds like they got
the shit knocked out of'em.

539
00:57:26,145 --> 00:57:28,807
He keeps talking about that
big offensive south of here...

540
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:30,815
and he doesn't want
any part of it.

541
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,044
They think the war's almost over
and they don't want to get killed...

542
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,054
in the last few days.

543
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:39,819
I told him we'd bring our leader here
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

544
00:57:39,892 --> 00:57:42,417
We're going
to bring Ware here?

545
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:45,191
Look, just get Mother
out on guard duty...

546
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:47,255
and get the squad together,
all right?

547
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,097
What are we gonna do
about an officer?

548
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:50,303
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

549
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:53,204
I don't know about this.
Why can't Will just do it?

550
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:55,433
- He's the leader, for Christ's sake.
- They've already seen him.

551
00:57:55,508 --> 00:57:59,137
Besides, no Kraut's ever gonna believe
that a guy like Will is an officer.

552
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:01,305
- Take a look at him.
- Thank you, thank you.

553
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,678
Then let's let Mel just do it.
He's a natural leader type.

554
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:06,809
Hey, wait a second. I'm not even sure
I want to be part of this plan.

555
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:09,013
Besides, I don't look
like an Aryan god.

556
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:13,216
What is this?
Father, it's all stripes and no rocker.

557
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:17,251
- What's that mean?
- It's something new, Miller.

558
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:21,664
You're our bastard sergeant minor.
Besides, we don't have any rockers.

559
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:23,793
What if it's like some kind of...

560
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,532
"capture the commander" scheme
the Krauts have worked out?

561
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:29,040
You know, put a bullet in my head
or something.

562
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:34,379
Hey, look, Bud, why don't you
just try walking now?

563
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:41,343
- The man walks like a soldier.
- Put more pigheaded asshole into it.

564
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,445
- That I can do.
- Chest out, chest out.

565
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:46,356
Yeah, that's it!
That'll do just fine.

566
00:58:46,425 --> 00:58:48,484
Just stand there like an SOB
and nod occasionally.

567
00:58:48,561 --> 00:58:50,495
You know, you actually do
look like an officer.

568
00:58:50,563 --> 00:58:53,896
- I actually feel like an asshole.
- That's about the same thing.

569
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:55,957
Mother gets off post in five minutes.

570
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,970
- Let's not blow his Christmas present.
- Sure this is a good idea?

571
00:59:05,077 --> 00:59:07,671
I can't stop worrying.

572
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:10,375
God, I hope we're doing
the right thing.

573
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:18,556
- Yeah.
- Will, listen.

574
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:21,457
There are five or six of them
down here working like crazy.

575
00:59:21,527 --> 00:59:24,428
They got something big with them.
Could be a mortar.

576
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:26,863
I think maybe you better have somebody
man that upper post to cover us.

577
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,401
Shit. Mel, you and Mother
go up to the upper post.

578
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:31,436
Stan says they're
setting up a mortar.

579
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:38,042
All right. Listen. Mother and Avakian
are going to the upper post.

580
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,441
You want me down there?

581
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:12,068
- Father?
- Yeah, Will.

582
01:00:12,144 --> 01:00:14,942
Get your butt down here.
You of all people shouldn't miss this.

583
01:01:18,878 --> 01:01:22,780
Bethlehem

584
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,515
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

585
01:01:29,855 --> 01:01:34,019
For you. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

586
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:38,029
Merry Christmas.

587
01:01:44,236 --> 01:01:46,261
Merry Christmas
Happy New Year.

588
01:01:53,746 --> 01:01:55,839
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

589
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:16,401
Merry Christmas.

590
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:37,452
Holy night

591
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:41,755
All is calm

592
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:45,285
All is bright

593
01:02:45,364 --> 01:02:49,698
Round yon virgin

594
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:53,330
Mother and child

595
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:57,274
Holy infant

596
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,971
- So tender and mild
- Merry Christmas.

597
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:02,513
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

598
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:10,113
Sleep in heavenly peace

599
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:17,357
Sleep in heavenly peace

600
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:30,803
O come ye
O come ye

601
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:35,279
To Bethlehem

602
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,941
Hey, Father, they teach you
German in the seminary?

603
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:41,043
What the hell were you two
talking about?

604
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,556
I just kept saying "Merry Christmas"
and "Happy New Year."

605
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:47,319
I said it maybe 50 times.

606
01:03:47,393 --> 01:03:50,055
- What did he say to you?
- Well...

607
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:53,496
he said something
that sounded like...

608
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:56,399
"Throw me a why not."

609
01:03:56,469 --> 01:04:01,338
And then, when he tried
to hand me his gun, he said...

610
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:05,002
"Why not go shrink."

611
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,637
"Frohlich Weihnachten"
is "Merry Christmas..."

612
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:11,012
and "Weihnachtsgeschenk"
is "Christmas present."

613
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:15,045
I wonder what the Germans
thought Father was saying.

614
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:20,153
What's going on?

615
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:23,491
Couldn't get anybody
to answer the phone.

616
01:04:23,562 --> 01:04:26,395
Oh, my God.
Mother, I'm sorry.

617
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:28,797
I forgot all about you
up there.

618
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:35,136
I...

619
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,300
I heard singing.

620
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:41,446
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

621
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:44,005
The Germans just wanted
to spread a little holiday cheer.

622
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,051
Father even did some
present exchanging.

623
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:48,052
They gave us sausages,
Vance.

624
01:04:51,257 --> 01:04:54,454
- Is that what happened, Will?
- Yeah, that's it.

625
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,461
This particular branch
of the German army...

626
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:00,329
seems to believe in turning off
the war every once in a while.

627
01:05:14,613 --> 01:05:17,514
I don't know if I can take
this kind of war.

628
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:21,144
I'd rather we kept out of each other's
way, except when we have to fight.

629
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:01,317
Oh, shit.

630
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:11,066
This is meine kommandier.

631
01:06:18,777 --> 01:06:20,938
Hey, Will, come over here.

632
01:06:21,013 --> 01:06:24,039
Okay. Okay,
they do want to surrender.

633
01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:27,279
As soon as possible.
Today. They...

634
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:31,483
He's convinced that this German push
is coming through here any time now.

635
01:06:31,557 --> 01:06:33,718
There's a kicker.

636
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:36,925
It's a big kicker.

637
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:39,487
The young ones are scared shitless
that if the Germans come through here...

638
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:42,125
and it looks like they
surrendered without a struggle...

639
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:45,068
it's gonna be taken out
on their families.

640
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:48,732
Everything is nuts back home and they
don't want their parents to get shot...

641
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:51,332
or put in camps because
their sons were cowards.

642
01:06:52,645 --> 01:06:54,636
Well, do they have a suggestion?

643
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:57,210
Yeah.

644
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:02,854
They want us to take 'em
in a fake skirmish.

645
01:07:02,921 --> 01:07:03,979
What?

646
01:07:04,056 --> 01:07:07,822
Just make some noise, leave some
spent cartridges, grenade fragments.

647
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:09,884
No. No, absolutely not.

648
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:12,021
- Will...
- No! It doesn't make any sense.

649
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:14,190
Just calm down. Now you're gonna
blow the whole operation here.

650
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:16,564
- It's crazy!
- Be quiet! Quiet!

651
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:18,068
- Shut up!
- You wanna get us killed?

652
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:20,230
We're not gonna do it!
And don't tell me to shut up!

653
01:07:26,478 --> 01:07:29,879
Will, I know it sounds nuts,
I know, but...

654
01:07:29,948 --> 01:07:32,007
I think it's the only way
they're gonna go for it.

655
01:07:33,152 --> 01:07:34,915
They're just kids.
They're just scared.

656
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:37,217
They're just scared kids.
Look at 'em.

657
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:42,927
I don't know.

658
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:45,589
You trust these
fuckin' Nazis, Stan?

659
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,693
- What does that mean?
- He said they're not Nazis.

660
01:07:50,769 --> 01:07:55,263
They're just regular German army.
They're regular army like we are.

661
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:04,972
I say we do it.

662
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,451
What if it's a trap?

663
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,581
It's not much of a trap, having us
both come fully armed to a skirmish.

664
01:08:12,658 --> 01:08:15,821
I mean, at best, it's just
mutual suicide, right?

665
01:08:15,894 --> 01:08:17,953
What if they're using the noise
to bring in reinforcements?

666
01:08:20,099 --> 01:08:23,466
No. If they wanted to do that,
they could've done that the first night.

667
01:08:23,535 --> 01:08:26,834
He's right, Will, he's right.
And take a look at 'em.

668
01:08:26,905 --> 01:08:31,239
Things must be bad in the vaterland
to have an army of old men and boys.

669
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:45,581
- Okay, what do we do?
- Just give a little nod.

670
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:49,917
We agree to come
this afternoon...

671
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:53,954
make a lot of noise with rifles
and grenades and take them in.

672
01:08:54,032 --> 01:08:58,025
Able 1 to Able 4, over.
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

673
01:08:58,103 --> 01:09:00,162
Yeah, you got anything yet, over?

674
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:04,335
Yes, sir, I think we're gonna
be able to take a prisoner, sir.

675
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:06,843
We found some tracks.
Our plan is to hit their outpost...

676
01:09:06,912 --> 01:09:09,039
around 3:00 this afternoon.

677
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:11,844
- Over.
- Good. Do it.

678
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:15,546
I'll come out. Maybe Griffin too.
We'll bring the prisoner back. Over.

679
01:09:16,755 --> 01:09:19,019
No, sir, I don't think
that's necessary, sir.

680
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:21,025
Tell Major Griffin that...

681
01:09:21,093 --> 01:09:23,027
No sense in him taking the risk
coming all the way out here.

682
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:25,325
We'll have the jeeps ready
with the chains...

683
01:09:25,397 --> 01:09:27,365
and we'll get that prisoner
to you, sir, over.

684
01:09:27,432 --> 01:09:29,366
- I'll tell him.
- Over and out.

685
01:09:29,434 --> 01:09:31,368
Over and out.

686
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:37,801
I tell Mother we're going out
to try for a prisoner.

687
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:42,404
I tell him if we're not back in
two hours to call Ware at the base.

688
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:45,712
He's obviously glad
not to be on the patrol.

689
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:50,483
We hide Miller's officer outfit
under his snow poncho.

690
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,587
Now what? Walk down there
and knock on the door?

691
01:09:59,865 --> 01:10:02,732
Well...

692
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:05,736
here I go.

693
01:10:05,804 --> 01:10:07,863
I'm not sure what to do
so they don't shoot me.

694
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:11,598
- Try yelling "comrade."
- Is that it?

695
01:10:11,677 --> 01:10:14,305
Well, Stan, you could
wave a white flag.

696
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:16,574
Then it would look like
the wrong group was surrendering.

697
01:10:20,152 --> 01:10:23,087
We're right here covering you.
Good luck.

698
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,428
Oh, boy.

699
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:09,128
We wait.
There's nothing else to do.

700
01:11:49,474 --> 01:11:51,704
- What's going on? Everything all right?
- Yeah.

701
01:11:51,777 --> 01:11:54,837
He wanted to talk to our officer
"Herr Muller" here.

702
01:11:54,913 --> 01:11:57,143
You know, I'm sure
it's because I'm a Jew.

703
01:11:57,215 --> 01:12:01,447
All right, you nick-prickJew-type,
take me to my Aryan friends.

704
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,511
All right,
if they're really giving up...

705
01:12:03,588 --> 01:12:05,783
why are they
putting a guy on post?

706
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:07,916
Who are they
guarding themselves from?

707
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:11,721
Maybe other Germans.

708
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:13,856
They probably have
a Major Griffin of their own.

709
01:12:13,932 --> 01:12:17,424
Ubergruppenfuhrer Griftoch
or something.

710
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:19,629
Don't worry.

711
01:12:19,705 --> 01:12:21,730
Come on.

712
01:12:43,628 --> 01:12:47,223
- That's nice.
- Okay, here's how it's gonna work.

713
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:51,360
They'll wind up in front of the cabin.
Miller and I will stay as protection.

714
01:12:51,436 --> 01:12:53,904
All right, now, you go on out
with the rest of the squad.

715
01:12:53,972 --> 01:12:56,770
When old Shickelgruber here and I
signal, we all start firing.

716
01:12:56,842 --> 01:12:58,901
When we signal again,
we all stop.

717
01:12:58,977 --> 01:13:03,038
Then you guys come down the hill,
we disarm them and take them in.

718
01:13:03,115 --> 01:13:06,949
All we need is a nod from Miller
and they'll get their stuff together.

719
01:13:35,647 --> 01:13:38,275
Dismiss me.
I'll go inform Father and Mel.

720
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,875
- What?
- Dismiss me.

721
01:13:43,155 --> 01:13:48,149
Will, why don't you get up on that hill
and go inform Father and Will... Mel.

722
01:15:25,257 --> 01:15:28,488
Mother!
Hold your fire!

723
01:15:52,984 --> 01:15:54,918
Go check on
Shutzer and Miller.

724
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:01,592
Hang in there, Father.

725
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,561
We're gonna get you wrapped up
and get you outta here.

726
01:16:08,099 --> 01:16:10,090
You warm enough?

727
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:18,199
Anybody else hit?

728
01:16:18,276 --> 01:16:20,267
Everybody's fine, Father.

729
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:26,448
- Are the Germans dead?
- Don't worry about that.

730
01:16:31,356 --> 01:16:33,790
You all right?

731
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,729
God have mercy
on those poor Germans.

732
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,591
God have mercy on us.

733
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:54,742
- Don't... Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

734
01:16:54,813 --> 01:17:01,548
- Don't tell Mother.
- I won't.

735
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,680
Don't tell...
Don't tell Mother.

736
01:17:04,756 --> 01:17:06,951
Promise me.

737
01:17:07,025 --> 01:17:09,016
I won't.

738
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:00,477
Is he dead?

739
01:18:03,448 --> 01:18:05,973
I think so, Vance.

740
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:15,617
He ran out to warn me.

741
01:18:19,297 --> 01:18:21,231
Why?

742
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,064
I don't understand.

743
01:18:24,135 --> 01:18:27,263
I had a perfect position.

744
01:18:29,808 --> 01:18:31,935
I don't get it.

745
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:39,884
He's stupid, Vance.

746
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:42,818
He does stupid things.

747
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:04,607
What a mess.

748
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:07,839
Shit! It looked so easy.

749
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:11,939
Looks like our friend here
got a million-dollar wound.

750
01:19:12,016 --> 01:19:13,950
The one guy who wants
to fight these bastards...

751
01:19:14,018 --> 01:19:16,384
and I get
the million-dollar wound?

752
01:19:16,454 --> 01:19:18,445
Isn't it the way?

753
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:22,025
How's Mundy?

754
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:26,655
He's dead. He died fast.
There was nothing I could do.

755
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:39,635
What a fuckup.

756
01:19:42,313 --> 01:19:44,747
Father said don't tell Mother.

757
01:19:44,816 --> 01:19:46,750
That's what we'll do.

758
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:51,312
We were pinned down,
and he saved us.

759
01:19:51,389 --> 01:19:53,380
That's the plan.

760
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:23,354
Mother tells us
why he came out after us.

761
01:20:23,421 --> 01:20:27,255
Ware and Griffin are at the chateau,
looking for their prisoner.

762
01:20:27,325 --> 01:20:31,728
Well, we've got one,
if he stays alive.

763
01:20:32,897 --> 01:20:35,388
It's hard to look at Father.

764
01:20:35,467 --> 01:20:38,197
I keep waiting
for his eyes to open...

765
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:44,839
waiting for him to tell me
it'll be all right if I just have faith.

766
01:20:54,486 --> 01:20:56,113
Sergeant Knott.

767
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:58,212
- Yes, sir.
- Get some men out on post.

768
01:20:58,289 --> 01:21:01,747
The enemy camp may have heard
that skirmish and sent out a patrol.

769
01:21:01,826 --> 01:21:04,556
Well, sir, before the prisoner
went into shock...

770
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:07,189
he told Shutzer that an enemy attack
was expected at any time.

771
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:09,756
Well, now, holy shit, soldier!

772
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:12,632
Just when the fuck
were you gonna tell us that?

773
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,934
I thought this was an I & R platoon,
for Christ's sake!

774
01:21:15,006 --> 01:21:17,201
Lieutenant, get me Regiment
on the horn immediately.

775
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:19,266
Whiz kids, my ass!

776
01:21:21,045 --> 01:21:23,912
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

777
01:21:23,982 --> 01:21:28,419
- Able 1 to Able 4, over.
- Corporal Leary here, over.

778
01:21:30,488 --> 01:21:32,718
Son, this is Major Griffin.
You take down this message...

779
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:35,224
and get it to Regimental Command
on the double-quick, over.

780
01:21:35,293 --> 01:21:37,318
Wilco, sir. Over.

781
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:40,228
"Have contacted enemy
and taken prisoner.

782
01:21:40,298 --> 01:21:44,029
Have suffered casualties.
One dead, one wounded.

783
01:21:44,102 --> 01:21:46,570
Have destroyed enemy outpost.

784
01:21:46,638 --> 01:21:50,369
Prisoner claims impending enemy attack
through this sector at any moment.

785
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:55,111
Repeating. Prisoner claims impending
enemy attack at any moment.

786
01:21:55,179 --> 01:21:59,548
Am leaving immediately with prisoner and
wounded for base. Signed, Major Griffin."

787
01:21:59,617 --> 01:22:02,609
- Get that to the regimental commander.
- He ain't gonna make it.

788
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:04,917
Over and out. Let's go.

789
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,685
Sergeant Knott...

790
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:13,162
have your men transfer the chains
from your jeep to my vehicle.

791
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:15,825
We have a long way to go,
and the road's gonna be very rough.

792
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,868
- Yes, sir.
- Son...

793
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:22,901
I am shocked by
the conditions of these quarters.

794
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:24,908
This is private property.

795
01:22:24,976 --> 01:22:27,137
The United States government
is responsible for it.

796
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:29,907
It was in bad shape
when they moved in, Major.

797
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:35,312
Are you finished, Lieutenant?

798
01:22:35,386 --> 01:22:39,447
Because there is ample evidence
to indicate a dereliction of duty...

799
01:22:39,524 --> 01:22:43,551
and conduct not becoming
an American combat troop.

800
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:45,596
I'll be dead honest
with you here, son.

801
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:49,326
I wonder if your fucking men even know
there's a war going on outside.

802
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,564
Were it not for extreme
extenuating circumstances...

803
01:22:53,638 --> 01:22:57,005
I would see that this soldier,
as noncom in charge...

804
01:22:57,075 --> 01:23:00,272
were brought before a military
review board and severely disciplined.

805
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:03,576
And where the fuck
are your stripes?

806
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:06,674
I'll be goddamned if you haven't
had enough time to sew them on.

807
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:09,777
Yes, sir.

808
01:23:09,854 --> 01:23:13,255
- I'll get on it.
- No! You know what you'll do?

809
01:23:13,324 --> 01:23:15,792
You will march your ass outside...

810
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:21,457
and transfer those chains from your jeep
to my vehicle on the double-time.

811
01:23:21,532 --> 01:23:23,591
Now!

812
01:23:34,912 --> 01:23:37,472
Lieutenant...

813
01:23:37,548 --> 01:23:41,678
do not ever contradict me
in front of the men again.

814
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:44,946
All right, buddy,
you're almost home.

815
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:55,357
What do you think, Mel?
Is he gonna be all right?

816
01:23:57,068 --> 01:23:59,662
Yeah, Shutzer's strong.
He'll be okay.

817
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:05,942
They won't fall out
if you're careful, sir.

818
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:08,843
It's a rough trip, but it'd help
if you'd loosen the tourniquets...

819
01:24:08,913 --> 01:24:11,541
every once in a while.

820
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:14,847
- We'll do the best we can, Knott.
- Thank you, sir.

821
01:24:16,587 --> 01:24:19,055
Don't worry, Knott.
You done a good job.

822
01:24:20,124 --> 01:24:22,354
I don't think so, sir.

823
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:29,298
Knott, Major Griffin wants you
to keep the squad here...

824
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:30,891
until the Krauts attack.

825
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,702
Stay here, sir?

826
01:24:35,773 --> 01:24:37,968
What do we do
when the attack comes?

827
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:40,033
You contact us by radio.
We'll give you our position...

828
01:24:40,111 --> 01:24:43,080
then you get the hell out,
understood?

829
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:48,979
- Understood, Knott?
- Yes, sir.

830
01:24:49,053 --> 01:24:51,044
Lieutenant Ware, goddamn it!

831
01:24:51,122 --> 01:24:53,955
Are you going to baby-sit
or drive this fucking jeep?

832
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:57,017
- Be right there, sir, on the double.
- Get your ass in here!

833
01:24:57,095 --> 01:24:59,120
Good luck, Knott.

834
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:37,292
Did you ever think about
how many dead people there must be?

835
01:25:41,205 --> 01:25:44,140
Looks like Father just joined
the great majority.

836
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:51,375
Father told me he still wanted
to be a priest.

837
01:25:54,218 --> 01:25:56,743
He just didn't think
he was pure enough.

838
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,963
You know, I've been thinking
maybe Father's the lucky one.

839
01:26:10,568 --> 01:26:13,901
I mean, is this whole world
run by shits like Griffin?

840
01:26:16,274 --> 01:26:18,868
If we get through this,
is that the way it's gonna be?

841
01:26:47,972 --> 01:26:51,066
What's the tree for?
You gonna burn it?

842
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:55,679
Vance thought
a little Christmas cheer...

843
01:26:55,746 --> 01:26:58,681
would pick things up
around here a little bit.

844
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:03,946
Thought we could roast some chestnuts
and stuff ourselves with turkey.

845
01:27:06,157 --> 01:27:08,250
You first, Will.

846
01:27:12,396 --> 01:27:14,796
You aren't the rankest, but...

847
01:27:14,866 --> 01:27:16,925
you do have rank on us.

848
01:27:18,236 --> 01:27:20,534
It's a...

849
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:22,573
It's a Christmas present.

850
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:32,243
We try to turn off the war.
We don't even keep a guard on.

851
01:27:32,316 --> 01:27:34,614
We figure when the attack starts,
we'll hear it.

852
01:29:43,981 --> 01:29:46,973
I asked Ware to put you in
for a citation.

853
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:49,542
I hope that's okay.

854
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:54,424
I think Father or Stan
should get it.

855
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,186
No. You should.

856
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:02,528
The Germans had us pinned down,
and you saved our asses.

857
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:12,436
I only shot twice.

858
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:17,470
After Father went down,
l... I didn't shoot anymore.

859
01:30:17,548 --> 01:30:20,346
My glasses were all fogged up.

860
01:30:20,418 --> 01:30:23,649
- I don't even know if I hit anybody.
- It doesn't matter.

861
01:30:23,721 --> 01:30:26,281
Just stick with the story.

862
01:30:26,357 --> 01:30:28,291
You shot them all.
That's what I told Ware.

863
01:30:28,359 --> 01:30:31,886
Maybe if you get decorated,
we can get you pulled out of here.

864
01:30:37,968 --> 01:30:42,462
Two-thirds of the squad is gone now.
I don't see how we're gonna make it.

865
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:48,176
I'll make you a bet, Vance.

866
01:30:48,245 --> 01:30:50,873
I'll bet you that
in six months...

867
01:30:50,948 --> 01:30:54,315
you're back with Linda,
and she's pregnant...

868
01:30:54,385 --> 01:30:57,047
and this will all be something
you hardly remember.

869
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,049
I doubt that.

870
01:31:03,694 --> 01:31:05,685
I'll bet you $100.

871
01:31:08,165 --> 01:31:10,326
Who has $100?

872
01:31:14,071 --> 01:31:16,835
You can pay me off
a bit at a time.

873
01:31:19,243 --> 01:31:21,871
We'll start
New Year's Day, 1946.

874
01:31:33,157 --> 01:31:35,489
- It's a bet.
- Yeah.

875
01:31:44,435 --> 01:31:44,935
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

876
01:31:44,935 --> 01:31:46,562
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

877
01:31:46,637 --> 01:31:49,162
Able 1 to Able 4, over.

878
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,674
- Able 1 to anybody, over.
- Will, we got to go.

879
01:31:51,742 --> 01:31:53,676
Pull up the phones and the wires.

880
01:31:53,744 --> 01:31:55,837
Miller, if anybody can get
through on this thing you can.

881
01:31:55,913 --> 01:31:59,610
Just keep trying, all right?
Let's get Father out to the jeep.

882
01:31:59,683 --> 01:32:02,243
- Come on.
- Able 1 in.

883
01:32:03,754 --> 01:32:06,120
Able 4, come on.
Able 1 to Able 4.

884
01:32:18,068 --> 01:32:20,036
- Come on!
- Come on, Will! Let's go!

885
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:22,038
Shit!

886
01:32:22,106 --> 01:32:24,836
Come on, Will, move it!
Move it!

887
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:36,581
Fuckin' Griffin
took the chains off the jeep!

888
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:52,529
Christ! There they are!

889
01:32:59,176 --> 01:33:01,701
- Oh, fuck!
- You all right?

890
01:33:02,947 --> 01:33:07,077
- I think so.
- Father got some.

891
01:33:11,488 --> 01:33:14,218
Another 100 yards
and we'll be out of range!

892
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:20,925
- Straighten out.
- I can't! It's not doing anything!

893
01:33:20,998 --> 01:33:23,398
Straighten out!
Jesus Christ!

894
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:36,502
- You guys all right?
- Hold it! We're about to slide over.

895
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:38,639
Put some weight on the back,
Mother, on the back!

896
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:41,082
Let's go. Let's go.

897
01:33:42,853 --> 01:33:47,449
- All right?
- Let's get Father and get out of here!

898
01:34:07,544 --> 01:34:12,072
Well, Sergeant Knott,
what the fuck do we do now?

899
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:16,017
I can't believe
they'd just leave.

900
01:34:16,086 --> 01:34:19,180
Mel, what do you think?

901
01:34:19,256 --> 01:34:21,850
I don't know,
but we'd better keep moving.

902
01:34:39,977 --> 01:34:43,105
- I have no idea where we are.
- Just go.

903
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:46,343
- We could be heading for Berlin.
- Just go!

904
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:42,931
We're out of gas.

905
01:36:08,165 --> 01:36:11,157
We'll probably have
to surrender any time now.

906
01:36:11,235 --> 01:36:13,362
Miller insisted on
rigging up the.30 caliber.

907
01:36:13,437 --> 01:36:15,371
But without a real mount...

908
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:18,806
it probably wouldn't sit still
long enough to hit anything.

909
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:23,575
We can't stay here long,
and the jeep is dead.

910
01:36:23,647 --> 01:36:26,673
I wish Shutzer were here.
He might know what to do.

911
01:36:28,752 --> 01:36:30,720
I'm through playing soldier.

912
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,462
Did you see those markings?
That was honest-to-shit SS.

913
01:37:14,898 --> 01:37:17,731
What do we do now, Will?

914
01:37:17,801 --> 01:37:20,998
We stay away from them.

915
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:24,666
What, you think they were
advancing or retreating?

916
01:37:27,845 --> 01:37:30,075
I wonder what they'll think?

917
01:37:30,147 --> 01:37:34,174
Maybe this will convince them
I am over the edge.

918
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:36,412
We'll have a mutiny.

919
01:37:36,487 --> 01:37:38,455
I'll join it.

920
01:37:41,758 --> 01:37:44,352
- Thirty caliber?
- We'll bury it.

921
01:37:45,429 --> 01:37:47,829
- Radio?
- Bury it.

922
01:37:47,898 --> 01:37:52,665
- Rifles too?
- There's no other way.

923
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:58,232
Even if we pull this off and get back,
what are we going to say?

924
01:37:58,308 --> 01:38:02,438
We'll say we were captured and they
took our weapons and then we escaped.

925
01:38:02,513 --> 01:38:04,811
But I'm thinking with
all this confusion going on...

926
01:38:04,882 --> 01:38:06,941
there's not gonna be
too many questions.

927
01:38:11,355 --> 01:38:14,188
We do it together or nothing.

928
01:38:14,258 --> 01:38:18,126
If anybody has any objections,
any at all, speak up now.

929
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,923
Well, for what it's worth,
I say we do it.

930
01:38:23,767 --> 01:38:25,701
Yeah, me too.

931
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:31,002
I mean, the idea's so wild, I'd be sorry
for the rest of my life if I didn't try.

932
01:38:31,074 --> 01:38:34,942
Of course, the rest of my life
could be today.

933
01:38:37,247 --> 01:38:39,875
Mother, don't let us pressure you.
You make up your own mind.

934
01:38:41,818 --> 01:38:45,754
I already have. I was only
waiting on the other guys...

935
01:38:45,822 --> 01:38:48,313
so I wouldn't
put pressure on them.

936
01:38:52,396 --> 01:38:55,524
This could be the deepest finesse
in squad history.

937
01:39:02,005 --> 01:39:04,940
I've never seen a better smile.

938
01:39:05,008 --> 01:39:08,808
It's the smile I need to make myself
do what we're gonna do.

939
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,798
All right.

940
01:41:09,299 --> 01:41:10,425
Bleacher!

941
01:41:13,303 --> 01:41:14,793
Bleacher, goddamn it!

942
01:41:14,871 --> 01:41:17,135
We don't know the counter.
We're from another sector.

943
01:41:17,207 --> 01:41:19,675
Stay where you are.

944
01:41:25,115 --> 01:41:27,174
We're Americans.

945
01:41:37,027 --> 01:41:38,892
Is that blood?

946
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:43,599
We give him our escape story.

947
01:41:43,667 --> 01:41:46,192
They tell us to take Father
to the grave registrar.

948
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:20,160
They drive us back
to our own regiment.

949
01:42:20,237 --> 01:42:24,401
I'm sent straight to Ware,
and I tell him our story.

950
01:42:24,474 --> 01:42:26,874
I wander into
the kitchen tent...

951
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:31,539
and curl up to sleep behind
the warm pots of hot water.

952
01:42:48,698 --> 01:42:50,723
Just wanted to let you know
it's all settled.

953
01:42:51,468 --> 01:42:55,029
Since you weren't in a POW compound,
you won't have to go through clearance.

954
01:42:55,105 --> 01:42:57,335
You can go right back
out in the field.

955
01:42:57,407 --> 01:43:01,309
I'm gonna fill out your platoon
with an antitank group they broke up.

956
01:43:01,378 --> 01:43:04,142
I put in for a Bronze Star
for Wilkins.

957
01:43:04,214 --> 01:43:07,411
Had him reassigned to the motor pool.
He's gonna be okay.

958
01:43:07,484 --> 01:43:08,917
Thank you, sir.

959
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:14,154
Just wanted you to know I did my best
to radio you before we pulled out...

960
01:43:14,224 --> 01:43:16,158
but Griffin said
there wasn't any time.

961
01:43:18,328 --> 01:43:20,592
How's Shutzer doing?

962
01:43:20,664 --> 01:43:24,395
Real tough shit. He was dead
before we even got back.

963
01:43:24,467 --> 01:43:29,166
Kraut was dead too. Didn't even
have time to interrogate him.

964
01:43:29,239 --> 01:43:31,469
Before I go, you're gonna have to
fill out a statement of charges...

965
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:34,032
for the jeep, radio and phones.

966
01:43:56,666 --> 01:43:58,964
We'll be moving out soon.

967
01:43:59,035 --> 01:44:02,198
Gonna push those fucking Kraut
bastards all the way back to Berlin.

968
01:44:07,677 --> 01:44:09,702
Merry Christmas, Knott.
