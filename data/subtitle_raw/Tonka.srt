1
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,957
What is happening, White Bull?

2
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,519
The wild ones run
like frightened creatures.

3
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,800
If only they let us ride.
We could catch them.

4
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,740
If you had your choice,
which would you take?

5
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,813
The big brown colt
who trails the herd.

6
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,580
He's too slow.
He can hardly keep.

7
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,918
He runs last to protect the little ones.

8
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,231
Ah, he has courage.
He's truly a brave one.

9
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,128
I do not want him.

10
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,436
Good. He is mine.

11
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,779
And look, they're turning back.

12
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,881
Once they get through the canyon,
you will never see your horse again.

13
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,994
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to capture my horse.

14
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,129
The rope belongs to Yellow Bull.
He has forbidden anyone to use it.

15
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,696
A friend does not tell on another.

16
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,848
- Why are you not watching the travois?
- I try to catch a wild horse.

17
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,750
You'd catch a wild horse
with your bare hands?

18
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,552
- No, I... I used a rope.
- You do not own a rope, my cousin.

19
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,785
I borrowed one.

20
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,228
From the pack horse?
Well where is it now?

21
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,340
Around the neck of the wild horse.
He pulled it away from me.

22
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,411
Bad enough you disobey orders.
You steal my most prized possession!

23
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,618
From now on,
you walk with the women and dogs.

24
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,529
There has been trouble.

25
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,334
My son walks.
A sign he is being punished.

26
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,745
Look, White Bull walks!
Why do you walk, White Bull?

27
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,843
Did your horse throw you?

28
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,813
The great hunter!
White Bull chase buffalo on foot!

29
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,763
Poor White Bull!

30
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,062
The great hunter!

31
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,948
I'm not hungry.

32
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,855
You must eat
if you are to grow to manhood.

33
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,855
It's not food
that keeps me from becoming a man.

34
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,796
Food is important, too.

35
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,428
Not as important as horses.

36
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,491
Or scalps.

37
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,733
You walked back to camp.

38
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,606
Yellow Bull wouldn't let me ride.
He took my horse.

39
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,945
- Why?
- Because...

40
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,041
White Bull!

41
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,452
The chief wants you.

42
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,120
Yellow Bull.

43
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,153
You will know soon enough
what happened, Mother.

44
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,858
The whole camp will.

45
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,440
Yellow Bull has told me
that you disobeyed him.

46
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,414
That you left the travois,
stole his catching rope

47
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,577
and lost it chasing wild horses.

48
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,382
Sometimes, there are
two sides to a story.

49
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,924
It is your turn to speak.

50
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,693
It is true. But I didn't steal the rope.
I only wanted to use it.

51
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,204
Besides,
Yellow Bull has done wrong, too.

52
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,741
He risked losing the meat
when he chased the wild horses.

53
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,743
But I left you to guard it, my cousin.

54
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,211
It is tribal law
that rank has its privileges.

55
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,948
Yellow Bull has earned rank.
It is his right to make decisions.

56
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,788
But it is not the right of an
untried youth to question them.

57
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,387
It was Yellow Bull's duty to teach him
the arts of the hunt and the battle.

58
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,764
- He has done none of these things.
- The boy was too young until now.

59
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,896
When the time comes to teach him these
things, does he prove himself worthy?

60
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,497
No, he steals my rope.

61
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,409
What is worse, he loses the bow
and quiver of arrows our chief gave him

62
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,004
on the passing of his 16th summer.

63
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,949
Is this true, my son?

64
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,817
It is true.

65
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,470
This is a serious thing you have done,
White Bull.

66
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,804
It fills me with sorrow.

67
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:41,336
You must not go hunting again until you
have proved you are worthy of the trust.

68
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,644
That is all.

69
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,096
- I'll get even with Yellow Bull.
- Vengeance is a poor substitute

70
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,404
for honest achievement, my son.

71
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,468
You first duty is to find
the bow and quiver of arrows.

72
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,709
- Surely, you did not look hard.
- I didn't look at all.

73
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,249
Yellow Bull wouldn't let me.

74
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,717
He wanted me to be punished.

75
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,026
I'll go with the new sun
and search until I find them.

76
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,397
You should have seen him, Mother.

77
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,771
He was a reddish-brown in color.

78
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,902
Just like the leaves of trees
when winter comes.

79
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,173
He was big and strong.

80
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,083
He did run a little clumsy, though.

81
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,144
Well, that's because
he's young and still growing.

82
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:01,319
Growing up is a hard time for colts,
as well as for boys.

83
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,488
A time for big heads,
and for bigger feet.

84
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,691
A clumsy time,
a time for making mistakes.

85
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,563
Eat your supper, boy,
and go to sleep with your dreams.

86
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,130
The sun gets up early.

87
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,504
Don't be afraid.

88
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,570
I won't hurt you.

89
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,205
Hold still now.

90
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,713
Hold still now.

91
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,495
So you were trying to reach
the water, weren't you?

92
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,832
I'll get you a drink.

93
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,409
Boy, you sure got yourself
all tangled up, didn't you?

94
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,312
Hold still now.

95
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,889
Hold still now, boy.

96
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,548
That's it.

97
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,599
Easy, boy.

98
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,603
Hold it, boy! Hold it. Easy now.

99
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,977
Drink.

100
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,590
Hold it steady.

101
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,648
Pretty soon I'll let you go, but first,

102
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,058
I wanna make sure that
you don't get away from me.

103
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,771
Good. Good boy.

104
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,137
Now.

105
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,510
I could cut the rope,

106
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,948
but then I won't have it to use again.
Hold still, boy. Hold still.

107
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,245
Besides, it belongs to Yellow Bull.

108
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,017
I only borrowed it to capture you.

109
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,117
I liked you
from the first time I saw you.

110
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,094
I thought you ran good.

111
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:36,032
But Strong Bear, well he's my friend.
He said you were clumsy.

112
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,559
Well, maybe you are. Well that's because
you're still growing, like me.

113
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,132
I'm going to keep you here
and not let anyone know I have you.

114
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,177
Till we ride back to camp together.

115
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,413
You belong to me now.

116
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,349
Now hold still.

117
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,518
Whoa...

118
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,322
Whoa.

119
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,800
You think you are smart, eh?

120
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,934
Tomorrow, I will show you who is master.

121
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,097
Settle down, boy.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

122
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,193
I'll be back.

123
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,618
You did not find the bow and arrows.

124
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,125
- I...
- Never mind.

125
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,604
- You will have better luck tomorrow.
- I'll find them, Mother.

126
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,663
And I'll find Yellow Bull's rope, too.

127
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,611
And I will capture a wild horse
and train him myself.

128
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,548
And he will be the best horse
in all the Dakotas.

129
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,575
I will call him...
I'll call him Tonka Wakan.

130
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,518
The Great One.

131
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,027
- Stop boasting and eat.
- I'm not boasting, Mother.

132
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,120
It will happen as I say.

133
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,596
No more will they call you the mother of
a son who does not know how to be a man.

134
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,049
I'm coming, Tonka.

135
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,193
Look, boy. Look what I've got.

136
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,448
Grass is still wet with dew
and very tender. Better hurry.

137
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,721
Oh, if you want the grass,
you come get it.

138
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,818
Hold it, Tonka! Stop, Tonka!

139
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,474
Now behave yourself.

140
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:21,219
Phew! It's too hot to fight
on a day like this.

141
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,266
You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you?

142
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,837
I guess I'd feel the same way
if a white man capture me.

143
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,241
But, but I
want to be your friend, Tonka.

144
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,578
That's your name, boy. Tonka Wakan.

145
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,455
Now you stop fighting me,
we'll get along real good.

146
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,300
Ah, now that's better.

147
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,845
Now you're being smart.

148
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,088
Hold still, now.

149
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,893
Hold still.

150
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:35,399
There. Soon as I get you washed,

151
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:39,631
and the burrs out of your hair, you'll
look as good as any horse in camp.

152
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,728
Hold still.

153
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,810
Ho!

154
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,857
Well, captain,
looks like we're not so smart.

155
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,259
According to our manual, lieutenant,

156
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,061
surprise is a necessary element
of every attack.

157
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,660
Only they forgot to say
who gets surprised: us or the enemy.

158
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,599
We'll make camp here, Mr. Nowlan.
Place your picket line downstream.

159
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,975
- Prepare to dismount.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,504
Troop? Dismount, lead out.

161
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,858
Ha! Hyah!

162
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,783
Look, Tonka,
I brought you a friend.

163
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,089
She'll teach you
what a good horse should know.

164
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,395
Go on. Go on.

165
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:55,823
In an Indian tepee you will learn:
the woman is always the chief.

166
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,623
You want the grass, you come get it.

167
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,481
You better hurry, or she'll eat it all.

168
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,414
Well, you see?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

169
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,993
This is how a good horse behaves.

170
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,696
This is fun. Come on.

171
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,857
See this? This is wapato,
sweet as sugar and very good.

172
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,203
Mm, you like it. Good, huh?

173
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,011
Good, isn't it?

174
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,422
You want more? More?
No, you must earn it.

175
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,898
Easy.

176
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,663
Easy, Tonka.

177
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,364
Now if you'll let me ride you,
I'll give you more wapatos.

178
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,146
No, this time,
I think I give you more room.

179
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,209
Too many trees to bump into.

180
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,185
Too many rocks, too, to fall on.

181
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,399
No, no, you stay here,

182
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,668
so he'll come back if he throws me.

183
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,437
If he throws me.

184
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,864
Hyah!

185
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,663
You see?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

186
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,434
I'm your friend, Tonka.
You belong to me.

187
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,772
Let's stop and rest a while.

188
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,385
Soon, we'll start for my home,
far to the north.

189
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,650
There'll be rejoicing
when I return to my people.

190
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:56,091
My uncle is a great man. He'll forgive
me when he finds out what I've done.

191
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,287
Wapato.

192
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,193
No longer will my mother
hang her head in shame.

193
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,702
All that remains now
is to go on a hunt.

194
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,002
To kill a buffalo.
And to take a scalp in battle.

195
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,305
And we'll do these things together,
Tonka.

196
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,436
You'll take me to the hunt.

197
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,004
And you'll ride me to the battle.

198
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,606
Come.

199
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,407
Could be one of our horses.

200
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,206
Throw a couple of shots
and scare him.

201
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,544
Run, Tonka, run!

202
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,375
Come on. Come on, boy!

203
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,715
Ho!

204
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,389
Hold it, Hank.

205
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,963
That horse runs like a scared Comanche
with a load of buckshot in his breeches.

206
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,907
He was a lot of horse, all right.

207
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,706
A lot!

208
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,474
We don't have anything
that could even follow him,

209
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,516
let alone catch him.

210
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,051
On the left, ho!

211
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,882
Strong Bear, Strong Bear,
it is White Bull! Look, he has a horse!

212
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,749
Where have you been?

213
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,482
It is the young colt
we saw running with the wild herd.

214
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,820
Where did you get him?
How did you get him?

215
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,554
You will soon find out, Strong Bear.

216
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,265
Welcome home, White Bull.

217
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,276
It is good to be home, my uncle.

218
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,941
I have come back to prove to my chief
that I can be trusted.

219
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:44,579
I have recovered the bow and arrows, and
the rope of many-colored horse hairs,

220
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,748
which belongs to my cousin, Yellow Bull.

221
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:59,331
I wish to give it back,
so there will no bad feeling between us.

222
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:08,671
You have acted wisely. It pleases me.

223
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,214
What of the horses, nephew?

224
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,447
This one I call Tonka Wakan.
I caught him and trained him myself.

225
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,183
Oh,
he's truly the Great One.

226
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,523
And this one I call Prairie Bird,
after my mother.

227
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,463
I stole her from the white soldiers when
they came to the camp to attack you.

228
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,363
What kind of lie do you tell us now?

229
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,302
It is no lie.

230
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,036
I overpowered a soldier.
I drove their horses away.

231
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,635
All except this one.

232
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,044
I kept her to ride
and to help train the colt.

233
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,675
If you killed a soldier,
where's his scalp?

234
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:49,842
There wasn't time.

235
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,424
The soldiers came runnin.
I had to go quickly.

236
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,293
But I have the soldier's long knife
to prove that what I say is true.

237
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,897
I wish you to have it, my chief.

238
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,009
It will long be remembered, my nephew.

239
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,648
In return...

240
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,722
...I wish to give you this talisman
to protect you from evil spirits.

241
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,265
Now that you have
horses of your own,

242
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,528
I give you permission to go on hunts.

243
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,266
If all goes well,
you may soon ride into battle.

244
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,772
He looks like a horse of much courage.

245
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,219
He's the greatest horse
in all the land of the Dakotas.

246
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,183
I will show you.

247
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,953
Come, Tonka. Come on.

248
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,469
Come on!

249
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,009
Whoa!

250
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:38,353
Tonka Wakan,
it is a good name for the colt.

251
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,515
He truly is a Great one.

252
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,887
Did I not keep my promise?

253
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,365
Only a man
could do what you have done.

254
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,164
I am proud, my son.

255
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,398
I forgot to give him his reward.

256
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,372
When he does well, he gets wapato.

257
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,239
Be good to him,
and he will serve you well.

258
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,712
Come, it grows late.
We must take the horses to the pen.

259
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,282
Wait!

260
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,187
I wish to speak with my cousin.

261
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,853
We are in a hurry.
My cousin can speak another time.

262
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,589
You'll wait.

263
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,299
It's a fine horse
you have there, my cousin.

264
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,009
You've trained him well.
Strong legs.

265
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,604
Good teeth. I'll take him.

266
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,248
No. Nobody takes him.
He's mine. Now get away.

267
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,947
- Let go! You're scaring him!
- My horses were stolen!

268
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,923
- I need a horse to start a new string!
- Then find another.

269
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,086
You can't have Tonka. He's mine.
I caught him and I trained him.

270
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,756
- I demand you give him to me.
- No. It isn't fair.

271
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,231
He belongs to White Bull.

272
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,325
You have no right
to take my son's horse.

273
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:02,099
I have the right.
It's the privilege of my rank.

274
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,803
Take the mare. I give her to you.

275
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,608
- I want this one.
- No! Now get away!

276
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,108
Wait!

277
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,054
We will let our chief decide.

278
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,050
Your mother speaks wisely.
We'll let our chief decide.

279
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,400
While I do not approve
of Yellow Bull's action,

280
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,031
I cannot deny it is his right
according to tribal custom.

281
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:41,840
He is a great brave with 40
eagle feathers in his war bonnet.

282
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,437
White Bull has yet to earn
a single feather.

283
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,451
I'm sorry, nephew. The horse will
have to be turned over to Yellow Bull.

284
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,729
The colt is young like the boy.
Treat him kindly.

285
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,564
He must learn quickly that I am master.

286
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,282
It'll only be for a little while, Tonka.

287
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,109
I'll get you back somehow.

288
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,554
We'll still be together.

289
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,989
I'll dig wapatos for you.

290
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,525
Come on.

291
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,993
Spotted Tail, Barking Dog.

292
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,597
Bring me the white man's muzzle
with the iron in the mouth.

293
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,938
I'll take no chances
with this young one.

294
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,573
I'll take my horse, White Bull.

295
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,344
Whoa! Hey!

296
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,953
Down, devil! Down!

297
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,223
I know how to treat your kind!

298
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,094
Down!

299
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,428
Get a rope on him!

300
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,969
Hold on, Spotted Tail! I know
how to deal with this one!

301
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,703
He doesn't know
what they're doing to him.

302
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,707
He is young.

303
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,541
He will soon learn the cruelties
of man's ways, and bow to them.

304
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,346
But the blame is mine. I caught him.

305
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,113
It's my fault he's being hurt.

306
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,428
Leave him alone! He's never
had a bit in his mouth before!

307
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,530
He doesn't know
what you're doing to him.

308
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,158
Well, it's time he learned.

309
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,900
Yellow Bull is a madman.

310
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,639
I'll kill him!

311
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,704
I am your friend.
I will help you kill him.

312
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,512
You talk foolish.

313
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,749
Yellow Bull is a cruel man,
but he is also a brave warrior.

314
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,648
You would have little chance
against such a man.

315
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,773
Whoa!

316
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,643
Hyah!

317
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,289
This sorrow will soon pass.

318
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,797
Here, you still have Prairie Bird.
Take care of her.

319
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,595
I'll break the devil's spirit in you!

320
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,003
I'll break you!
I'll break you! I'll break you!

321
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,404
I'll break you!

322
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,449
Get up!
I'll make a good horse out of you yet!

323
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,081
Get up!

324
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,682
I'll break the devil's spirit in you!

325
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,824
I'll break you! I'll break you!

326
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,228
I'll break you! I'll break you!

327
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,614
I can't bear to see you hurt, Tonka.

328
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,656
I'm sending you back to your own kind.

329
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,168
Where you will be safe.

330
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,896
This is goodbye.

331
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,645
Our chief said it would protect me.

332
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,479
It will protect you, too.

333
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,826
I'll never forget you, boy.

334
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,092
You'll always be my friend.

335
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,368
Now go.

336
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,045
Go on. Run, Tonka.

337
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,243
Run fast and far
so they'll never catch you. Go on.

338
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,490
All right.

339
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,493
One last wapato.

340
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,565
Well, don't stand there! Go on!

341
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,452
Well, do as I say! Run! Run!

342
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,632
Go on! Run!

343
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,948
Goodbye, Tonka.

344
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,634
Whoa! You boys be ready
with them poles when we peal 'em.

345
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,434
We don't wanna take a chance
on spoilin' 'em.

346
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,965
Now Jeb, you and Jim
circle around to the left

347
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,511
and me and Sud'll
close in on 'em from the right.

348
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,447
I'll signal you when to spook 'em.
Come on.

349
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,506
Hold it.

350
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,519
Looks like there's trouble afoot.

351
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,895
Hey, this is gonna make it easy.

352
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:50,365
They'll be so busy a-fightin', they
won't even see us. Come on, let's go.

353
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,157
Get your ropes ready!
This young'n's gonna jump!

354
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,011
He's a strong one, ain't he?
He oughta bring 90 dollars.

355
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,290
Yah! Yah! Yah! Ho!

356
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,260
Ho! Ho!

357
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,195
Yah!

358
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,616
- Good morning, Hank.
- Morning, Myles.

359
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:25,121
Can I have a look at the new broncs
they brought in yesterday?

360
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:29,147
I'm always looking, Mr. Nowlan.
I'm the hopeful sort.

361
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,693
Well, you have a good horse, your Pokey.

362
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,197
Well, Pokey has good legs.

363
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,701
And a stomach only for hay,
not gunpowder.

364
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,295
You know, a cavalry mount should have
more than good legs and wind.

365
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,933
It should have a little extra...
something.

366
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,308
The glory of his snorting is terrible.

367
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:53,281
He paweth in the valley
and rejoices in his strength.

368
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,944
He goeth out to meet the armed men.

369
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,352
He mocketh at feat
and is not dismayed.

370
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:03,654
Neither turneth he back from the sword.

371
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:07,390
That, Mr. Nowlan,
is the kind of a horse I'm looking for.

372
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,831
That, Captain Keogh, is the best
description of a cavalry horse

373
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,889
I ever heard.

374
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,300
- Did you make it up?
- Book of Job, lieutenant.

375
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,637
Thirty-ninth chapter, 21st verse.

376
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,573
Hold still, you!

377
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,710
Ooh!

378
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,688
Where have I seen
that horse before, Hank?

379
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:37,693
It's not likely you ever did, Myles.
He's a real bronc.

380
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,355
He'll go down fightin' like a Comanche.

381
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,593
Wait a minute.

382
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,260
You remember that Indian
who ran away from us last fall

383
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,236
when we were looking
for stolen horses?

384
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,397
That's the young stallion he was riding.

385
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,441
Alright, get him down!

386
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,075
Alright, pry his mouth open.

387
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,992
How long has this been going on, Hank?

388
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,622
Ever since Corporal Jeeth was placed
in charge of the remount corrals.

389
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:20,101
That ring bit's his idea.
It's plain torture.

390
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,761
Grab him! Get a hold of him!

391
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,509
Yee-hoo!

392
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,584
Ah-ha! Ha!

393
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,633
Grab him! Hold him!

394
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,060
Look out! Stop that horse!

395
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,231
Get the corporal!

396
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,571
Whoa, boy, whoa!

397
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,441
Easy now. Nothing to be afraid of.

398
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,641
Easy, boy. That's it.

399
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,352
I don't blame you for doing
what you did, mister.

400
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,652
If that corporal isn't dead,
he deserves to be.

401
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,387
Get the corporal to the doc.
Bring me a halter.

402
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,156
Trooper, take the saddle off.

403
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,296
A good luck talisman.

404
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,860
You did belong to an Indian,
didn't you, boy?

405
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,339
I've got a hunch you took a beating
you didn't deserve.

406
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:09,071
But you stood up to him real good.
Yes sir, real good.

407
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,972
He goeth out to meet the armed men,

408
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,280
he mocketh at fear,

409
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,083
and is not dismayed.

410
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,522
I'll be wanting to buy this horse,
Mr. Nowlan.

411
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,891
- Make out the necessary papers.
- If you say so.

412
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,157
He'll take a name.
What are you gonna call him?

413
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,495
Comanche.

414
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,376
As for you, let me see or hear of
another breaking bit being used,

415
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,938
so help me, I'll give you a taste of it
in your own mouth. Now clear out.

416
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,381
Yes, sir.

417
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,267
Whoa.

418
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,626
Whoa.

419
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,846
Well, Mr. Nowlan, what did you think
of that little demonstration?

420
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:54,246
Well, he's a thoroughly trained horse,
that's for sure.

421
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:58,253
Not only thoroughly,
he's been trained gentle.

422
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,482
With a lot of patience.

423
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:03,354
We're gonna try
and do as well by you, mister.

424
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:08,557
No more ring bits, no tight cinches,
not even a martingale.

425
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:13,227
You can toss this big beautiful head
as much as you please.

426
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:17,966
Yes, sir, Comanche,
we're gonna get along fine.

427
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,230
Yes, sir.

428
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,868
Would you be good enough
to hold his head, Captain?

429
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,845
Go ahead, corporal,
I'll try to keep his mind occupied.

430
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:29,315
Well, now. Aren't you the handsome one?

431
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:33,219
You know, I think I can get
a fair price for you this morning.

432
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:37,282
Not that I'm gonna sell you, mind you.
Now you listen.

433
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,893
Now you see this?
It's a receipt for $100.

434
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:46,526
You belong to me, mister.
Until death do us part,

435
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,469
as the minister would say.

436
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,097
Right.

437
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,979
You see this, Comanche?

438
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,148
Plain old single bit.

439
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:14,094
This won't hurt your mouth any more
than this cigar hurts mine.

440
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:26,774
Now this, my friend,
is known as ground hitching.

441
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:30,677
It's very important a horse
learn to stay where a man leaves him.

442
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:35,343
Case he returns rather quickly with a
half a dozen redskins on his coattails.

443
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:43,253
Oh, no. No, sugar, you did it wrong.

444
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:47,057
You've gotta stay where I put you.
Now let's try it again.

445
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,837
All right. Wait a minute, Comanche.

446
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,669
You win. You win. You win.

447
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,368
Here you are.

448
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,245
Great chiefs, listen to me.

449
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,915
The young braves wear paint and cry
for war. We can restrain them no longer.

450
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,424
Each day, we grow strong in number.

451
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,088
Soon we will have more braves
than there are stars in the sky.

452
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,797
We must run the white men from our lands

453
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,302
or kill them off
as they have killed the buffalo.

454
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:33,102
First, we must know if the white man's
soldiers are many or few.

455
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:36,009
We will send braves to every fort
to find this out.

456
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:39,844
They will tell us
if we should have war or not.

457
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,999
Tonka. My horse, Tonka.

458
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,876
Turn out the door! Arm party!

459
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,243
We know how many soldiers
we have seen.

460
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,782
But we do not know
how many soldiers we have not seen.

461
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,316
When darkness comes,
let us go close to the fort.

462
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,779
- I will try to slip in.
- Too dangerous for you to go alone.

463
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,258
- I will go with you.
- No.

464
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:28,491
No. If I am to be a brave worthy
of trust, I must prove myself. Alone.

465
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,125
When darkness comes, the gates would be
closed and lights would be put out.

466
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,432
- You cannot count sleeping soldiers.
- I could count their horses.

467
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,167
That is true. And the risk is great.

468
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,400
But it would be a good thing to do.

469
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,567
See that he gets a good scrub down
and an extra ration of oats.

470
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,732
- Yes, sir.
- Captain Keogh reporting, sir,

471
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,709
- with 27 transferees from Hays.
- Welcome to Fort Lincoln, captain.

472
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,474
- Thank you, sir.
- General Custer, Commander of the 7th,

473
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,448
- Adjutant Cooke.
- I'm fortunate to have you with me.

474
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,782
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time, General.

475
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,084
Solid looking animal
you're riding, Captain.

476
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,819
Thank you, sir. Not as handsome
as your Vic or Dandy, General,

477
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:33,327
but all heart and legs.

478
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,387
Give him an
extra ration of oats and boom.

479
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:38,126
- He's ready to go again.
- What about you?

480
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,327
Give me a bag of oats, sir,
and I'm ready, too.

481
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,635
Good! The 7th's a fighting outfit.
There's some exciting times ahead.

482
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,268
Suits me fine. The sooner
you put me to work, the better.

483
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:52,075
Well,
then fall out at reveille, Mr. Keogh.

484
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:55,584
Captain Benteen's heading a small patrol
to run down some Indians.

485
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:59,610
Burned a wagon train, ran off with
two white women. They must be punished.

486
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,781
And the women rescued.

487
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:05,156
It's more important to teach those
red savages who's running this country.

488
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:08,253
They must learn quickly,
or be exterminated.

489
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:14,393
Mr. Cooke,
show, uh, Captain Keogh to his quarters.

490
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:18,065
- Yes, sir.
- See you at my table for supper.

491
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,904
- At 7:00.
- Yes, sir.

492
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,347
If I can't come back,
I will throw a rock over the wall.

493
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,713
A big rock
will mean there are many soldiers.

494
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,877
A little one, there are few.

495
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,330
Tonka!

496
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,934
It's good to see you again, Tonka.

497
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,139
You remember me, don't you?

498
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,376
Oh, I knew you would.

499
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:52,987
I... I saw them bring you here.

500
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,165
My heart was filled with sorrow.

501
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,826
But I knew you'd be protected.

502
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,900
Well, what is this?

503
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,877
Oh, you've been hurt, Tonka.

504
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,380
It's only a little thing, but...

505
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:20,380
White man's medicine. It is not good.

506
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:24,514
Only Indian medicine is good.

507
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:01,593
This will draw out the poison.

508
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,298
Soon as it dries. There.

509
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,815
Sorry to be late, old man,
but Chief Longhair was recounting

510
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,754
some of his Indian exploits,
and I couldn't walk out on him.

511
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:32,192
It doesn't pay to be rude
to a general. You remember that. Hear?

512
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,760
What's this?

513
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,892
Mud.

514
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,643
Climb out.

515
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,496
You understand white man talk?

516
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,964
What's your name? Your name!

517
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:19,474
- White Bull.
- What tribe?

518
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,635
- Teton Sioux.
- What are you doing in here?

519
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,511
- I came to see my horse.
- Your horse?

520
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:30,450
- Comanche?
- His name is Tonka Wakan.

521
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:34,353
- How do you know what his name is?
- He belonged to me.

522
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,288
I caught him. I named him.

523
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,194
What does Tonka Wakan mean?

524
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,631
- The Great One.
- I see.

525
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,269
And I suppose you trained him?

526
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,602
We had many good times together.

527
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:58,044
That explains a lot.

528
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,412
I knew he was trained
with great love and patience.

529
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,782
And I figured it was an Indian
because of the charm bag.

530
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:10,286
What puzzles me is how he got mixed up
in a band of wild horses again.

531
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,422
I was a youth without rank.

532
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,726
My cousin, Yellow Bull, claimed him.

533
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,095
He's a cruel man.

534
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:25,438
I couldn't bear to hear
Tonka's cries of pain in my sleep.

535
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,574
So I...

536
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,076
I set him free.

537
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:32,846
You think a lot of him, don't you?

538
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,219
I don't know why.

539
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,415
He's an ugly brute.

540
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,790
- He's beautiful.
- Well, in a homely sort of way.

541
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,399
When you came here tonight,
what were you gonna do?

542
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,436
- Steal him back?
- No.

543
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,171
No, Yellow Bull would only
take him from me again.

544
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,380
I saw you ride in this afternoon. I...

545
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:10,276
- I only wanted to see him.
- I think I understand, White Bull.

546
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:14,351
I feel the same way about Tonka.

547
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:18,484
Only I call him Comanche.
Because he's a fighter.

548
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:27,432
Well, I suppose it doesn't make any
difference how you got in here.

549
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,939
The fact remains
I can't let you just walk out.

550
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,542
They'll probably
wanna question you and...

551
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,238
But I promise you
no harm will come to you.

552
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,208
Let's go.

553
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,751
Oh, uh, wait a minute.

554
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:47,755
You think the, uh,
the mud is better than the salve?

555
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,586
Then we'll leave it.

556
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,955
I don't suppose it would do any good
to ask what you told 'em.

557
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,063
This much we know.

558
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,730
Sitting Bull is bringing all the tribes
of the Sioux Nation together.

559
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:40,301
Why?

560
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,744
I am only a youth. The great shaman
does not tell me what he is thinking.

561
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,111
Does he plan to make war?

562
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,674
- I don't know, Chief Yellow Hair.
- Lying, thieving redskin!

563
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,652
- Speak up!
- General.

564
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:57,283
He'd have his tongue cut out before he
told you the truth, even if he knew it.

565
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,159
Keogh's right, Custer.
The boy came to see his horse.

566
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,824
We caught him.
Now let it go at that.

567
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,732
All right. I'll let him go.

568
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,606
But first, I wanna give him a message
to take back to Sitting Bull.

569
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:20,540
Tell your great shaman that we have
many forts with many soldiers.

570
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:24,814
Tell him they will march and burn
every Sioux village to the ground,

571
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:28,755
unless he comes back to the reservation
and lives in peace.

572
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,251
Now you can turn him loose, captain.

573
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:37,287
Um... better lock him up. Turn him loose
first thing in the morning.

574
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:05,019
- My friends wait for me in the trees.
- Goodbye, White Bull.

575
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,994
I hope there will be no trouble
between your people and mine.

576
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,195
You have a good master, Tonka.

577
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,140
No longer will my heart
be heavy with sorrow for you.

578
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,912
Goodbye, boy.

579
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:50,197
Comanche, if we should ever meet him
out there as the enemy,

580
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,900
I want you to know
it was no doings of mine.

581
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,235
General Sheridan's plan of attack
calls for a three-pronged movement

582
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,970
against Sitting Bull's village here.

583
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,536
At the forks
of the Little and the Bighorn River.

584
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,515
General Gibbon will go up
the Yellowstone and down Bighorn.

585
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:45,678
General Custer
will go up the Rosebud two days' march.

586
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,119
Then move westward to meet up

587
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,522
with Gibbon and Cooke's column
on the 26th without forced march.

588
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,320
You will not attack
until you have joined forces.

589
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,263
- Any questions?
- Yes, sir.

590
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,665
Are we making war on all Indians?
Some are still at peace.

591
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,704
With your permission, General Terry,

592
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,864
I'd like to answer Captain Keogh.

593
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,670
There's no way
to separate the good from the bad.

594
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,577
They've burned, pillaged, murdered.
They're all bad.

595
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,376
Are there any questions?
If not, you may proceed at once.

596
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:24,485
And remember, Custer, the 26th.
Wait for us.

597
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:31,830
Yes, sir.

598
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,873
It's probably rank heresy, Hank,
but I think Chief Longhair

599
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:48,677
has a few plans of his own. It'd be
interesting to know what they are.

600
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,877
I'd feel better if I was going with you.

601
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,216
Gibbon's a good man.
You take care of him,

602
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,848
- Comanche'll take care of me.
- Good luck, Myles.

603
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,721
Thank you.

604
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,802
- Ho!
- Ho!

605
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:19,476
Big Indian village. About half a day's
march away in Valley of Bighorn.

606
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:20,981
- Over hill.
- Good.

607
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:22,573
- Mr. Cooke.
- Yes sir.

608
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,382
Make camp. But no bugles.
I want an officer's call immediately.

609
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,752
- Yes.
- Forward!

610
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,122
- Ho!
- Ho!

611
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:32,888
Close up! Close up!

612
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:45,134
Oh, at ease, gentlemen.
Be seated if you wish.

613
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,843
I promised Elizabeth
I wouldn't make a target of myself.

614
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:03,518
You know, it would make
a tempting scalp lock at that.

615
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,891
Mark Kellogg, gentlemen.
Newspaperman from Bismarck.

616
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,796
He's here for a story,
and I think we can give him one.

617
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,630
A large Indian village
lies directly ahead

618
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,035
in the Valley of the Little Bighorn.

619
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:21,064
We'll hit them at dawn tomorrow morning.
Catch them in their sleep.

620
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,202
Begging the general's pardon,
our orders were not to attack

621
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,214
until we joined forces
with Gibbon and Cooke.

622
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:30,547
An unsuspecting enemy
lies ahead of us, Captain.

623
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,986
It would be dereliction of duty
if I did not press the advantage.

624
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:37,252
More Indians than soldiers.
More Indians than stars in sky.

625
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:40,123
I pay you for scouting, Boyer,
not to make decisions.

626
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:44,393
Captain Benteen, you will circle west
with troops D, H and K

627
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:46,525
to cut off retreat upriver.

628
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,866
Major Reno, you will push
straight into the village

629
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:53,374
with troops A, G and M
and spearhead the attack.

630
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:56,604
I will sustain you
with troops C, E, F, L and I.

631
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:00,170
We'll rest here
without cooking fires or bugles,

632
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,546
and move out two hours before dawn.

633
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:07,247
without the jingle of sabers, gentlemen,
to give away our approach.

634
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,482
Take them off.

635
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,226
- That's all.
- Excuse me, sir.

636
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,593
We saw Indians trailing us.

637
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,758
They fled in the
direction of a village 15 miles ahead.

638
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,564
- They know our position, sir.
- Very good, lieutenant.

639
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,931
We will not wait.
We'll strike the hostiles quickly,

640
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,636
before they have a chance to prepare.

641
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:33,704
Pass the word to assemble at once.
That's all, gentlemen.

642
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,340
My guns, Boyer.

643
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:45,124
- No sabers. That's a funny one.
- Funnier, him cutting his hair.

644
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:47,058
Maybe he's got a hunch.

645
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,995
Into the valley of Death
rode the brave 600.

646
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,226
If we had 600, we'd have a chance.

647
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,030
To split us up...
You heard what the scout said.

648
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,836
- Good luck.
- You too.

649
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,437
Follow me!

650
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,880
- Ho!
- Ho!

651
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,250
- Officers front, Mr. Cooke.
- Yes, sir. Officers front!

652
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,694
- Officers front!
- Officers front!

653
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:35,808
Major Reno's engaged the enemy.
We'll ride north.

654
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:38,744
Cross the river.
Attack their camp from the rear.

655
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:42,146
I'm afraid your element of surprise
is lost, general.

656
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,330
Do not turn back until I signal.

657
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,466
- Are you afraid?
- No.

658
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,637
- Are you?
- Of course not.

659
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,469
- I will count first coup.
- I will take many scalps.

660
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,481
Earn many feathers for my war bonnet.

661
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,053
They're trying
to draw us away from Reno.

662
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,887
Which suits my plan exactly.

663
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:29,191
Rejoin your troops, General. Ready
your small arms for close-in fighting.

664
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,803
You'll get a story today, My. Kellogg.
You'll write history.

665
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:39,169
Forward to the devil, Mr. Cooke! Ho!

666
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,782
Fire at will! Fire at will!

667
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,985
Look, Strong Bear!

668
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:08,157
My friend, the white captain.
He's riding Tonka!

669
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:11,130
All white soldiers are enemies.
They must die!

670
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:20,173
Chief Yellow Hair is down!
It is a good omen!

671
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:25,303
Fight on foot! Dismount! Fight on foot!

672
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:30,045
Close up ranks!

673
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,987
Sound dismount!

674
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,622
- Form a service line!
- Steady now!

675
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,996
Form a line!

676
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,035
Take those horses uphill!

677
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,871
Horse holders, double up on your mounts!

678
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,935
Close up! Close up!

679
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:08,756
Watch that gully! Keep down!

680
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:15,289
Steady! Keep low!

681
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,439
Sir, our ammunition bags
are on those horses.

682
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:34,444
Never mind. Benteen'll be here soon.
Close ranks! Close ranks!

683
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:35,607
Watch your left flank!

684
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,299
Down, boy. Down! Down!

685
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,804
Close up! Rally! Rally!
Watch those shots!

686
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,644
Make every one count!
Pick your targets!

687
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:17,982
Watch Yellow Bull!

688
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:20,994
He will touch a dead soldier
and earn a feather for his bonnet!

689
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,464
I will earn a feather, too!

690
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,592
You won first coup.

691
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,492
You earned a feather.

692
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,770
We'll make 'em pay, boy.
We'll make 'em pay.

693
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:57,881
Ah!

694
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,908
Strong Bear?

695
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:38,023
May the spirit of Tonka Wakan
go with you.

696
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:46,697
Tonka? Tonka?

697
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:51,300
Tonka!

698
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:18,322
Tonka!

699
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:41,250
Your medicine is weak!

700
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,423
It didn't protect him.

701
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,403
Tonka.

702
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,442
Ho!

703
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:08,902
Tonka.

704
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,145
Lieutenant!

705
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:23,654
Poor devil.

706
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:26,124
Might as well put him out of his misery.

707
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,993
No!

708
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,100
No.

709
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,944
This horse is not your enemy.

710
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:49,710
- I am your enemy. Kill me.
- Glad to oblige you, redskin.

711
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,217
Wait!

712
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,345
This is the lad
we questioned at the fort.

713
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:02,624
Doctor.

714
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,924
7th Cavalry, US Army,
orders of the day.

715
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:11,028
Headquarters, US 7th Cavalry,
Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota Territory,

716
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:13,801
April 10th, 1878.

717
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,671
General orders number seven.

718
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:18,974
The horse known as Comanche,
being the only living representative

719
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:23,574
of the bloody tragedy of the Bighorn,
Montana, June 25th, 1876,

720
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:26,449
his kind treatment and comfort

721
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,546
should be a matter
of special pride and solicitude

722
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:32,353
on the part of the 7th Cavalry.

723
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:35,987
To the end that his life
may be prolonged to the utmost.

724
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:39,191
The command officer of Troop I
will see that a special

725
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,757
and comfortable stall
is fitted up for Comanche.

726
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:46,036
He will not be ridden by any person
whatever under any circumstances,

727
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:51,044
nor will he bet put to any work.
Hereafter, and upon all occasions

728
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:56,607
of ceremony, Comanche saddled,
bridled and led by a trooper

729
01:35:56,684 --> 01:36:00,518
of Company I will be paraded
with regiment

730
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,455
by command of Colonel Sturgess.

731
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,793
No.

732
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,062
No. No wapato.

733
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:18,594
Just because you're a hero, you think
you can do as you please, don't you?

734
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:34,779
I'm sorry, Chief Nowlan.
Tonka's like a child.

735
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:38,052
- He thinks he can do as he pleases.
- As far as the 7th is concerned,

736
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:42,084
he can do no wrong.
He knows it, too, don't you mister?

737
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:44,631
Too much sweet will make him

738
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,166
- fat and lazy, Chief Nowlan.
- It's gonna be your job

739
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,668
to see that he doesn't
get fat and lazy, White Bull.

740
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:53,104
- You must give him a ride every day.
- But the orders...

741
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:56,075
Sure, sure.
But generals who give orders

742
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,236
aren't smart
like you and me, White Bull.

743
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:00,780
We know he's gotta be exercised,
don't we?

744
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:05,477
Well, don't we?
