2
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,036
I won't be long, I'm just
going to check on my daughter.

3
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,444
Excuse me. Excuse me,
everyone. Sorry...

4
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,046
Has anyone seen Olivia?

5
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,649
Claire, what's going on?

6
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,454
I think you'd better
call the police.

7
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,937
So after everything
that's happened,

8
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,506
are there any new suspects?

9
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:03,974
There's a few, yes.

10
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,461
A search of the local area
has taken place.

11
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,963
As of now, nothing's been found.

12
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,602
We're urging anyone
with any information

13
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,437
to please come forward.

14
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,472
Thank you.

15
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:58,562
It's been two weeks since the
disappearance of Olivia Truman.

16
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,031
Olivia went missing from
her home in Greater London

17
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,032
during a family birthday party.

18
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:06,903
The nanny put Olivia to bed

19
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,906
and when I checked
later that night...

20
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,542
She was gone.

21
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,240
There was a large
gathering that night.

22
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:45,843
Police interviewed
everyone at the party.

23
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,844
And nobody saw a thing?

24
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:50,213
Nothing. She just vanished.

25
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,615
From her bed?

26
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,451
From her bed, yes.

27
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,920
Right under our noses.

28
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:15,705
I need as much info as you got
on a Roma Bernard.

29
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:17,809
Roma.

30
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,647
As in Romeo, Oscar,
Mike, Alpha.

31
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:31,020
That's it. And Bernard, err,
Bravo, Echo, Romeo,

32
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,657
November, Alpha,
Romeo and, yeah,

33
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,126
D for dickhead. That's it.

34
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,029
Everything you've got on him.

35
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,998
I'm speaking to the parents
first thing in the morning

36
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,166
so I need everything by then.

37
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,703
Can you do it?

38
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,538
You legend.

39
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:50,074
Cheers buddy.

40
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,542
All right,
I'll speak to you soon.

41
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,981
You coming to bed

42
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,550
or you sleeping on the sofa
like every night?

43
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,552
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.

44
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,120
You can take a break you know.

45
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,292
Your daughter misses you.

46
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:12,195
You hear me?

47
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,298
What do you want me to do?

48
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,800
Can you see what's going on?

49
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,901
Have you seen this case?

50
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,004
I crack this one...

51
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:24,007
That's chief inspector.

52
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,243
It's nice to see
what's important to you.

53
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,146
Good.

54
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,588
I'll be up in a minute.

55
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:39,823
Don't bother.

56
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,925
Oh, fuck.

57
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,627
I don't trust the parents.

58
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,028
Why not?

59
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,968
I dunno, there's something
not quite right about them.

60
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,670
What would you do
if Lucy went missing?

61
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:04,942
I don't know what I would do
if they took my son.

62
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:07,677
I do feel for the Trumans.

63
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,781
Yeah? Well my nose never lies.

64
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,850
And that's why I'll make
DCI and you won't.

65
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:14,985
Really?
We'll just see about that.

66
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,191
You have a lovely home.

67
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,058
Yeah.

68
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,629
How are you coping?

69
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:27,230
Staying positive.

70
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,331
Thank you.

71
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:30,968
Have you any new info?

72
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,907
What? What is it?

73
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,844
We need to speak
to your nanny again.

74
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,913
Mariam? She's gone back
to Romania.

75
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,984
Yeah, we heard that.

76
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,485
It's unfortunate considering
we told everyone

77
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,421
not to leave the country.

78
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,024
Well, she missed her daughter,
as I'm sure you understand.

79
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,793
Why would I understand?

80
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,961
We've heard about you.

81
00:08:57,994 --> 00:08:59,196
Good things.

82
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,801
We need to contact Mariam.

83
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,135
Why? What have you found?

84
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:09,740
We can't discuss that.

85
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,008
Don't give me that!

86
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,211
Don't.

87
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:15,512
I'm sorry-

88
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:16,846
- Just tell us something,
please.

89
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,115
Anything.

90
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,925
Some things have come to light
which involves your sister too.

91
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:29,326
Liz?

92
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,761
What has she got to
do with this?

93
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:32,062
Have you seen her recently?

94
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:33,831
No. Why?

95
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,232
You haven't spoken to your
sister since the night

96
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,399
your daughter disappeared?

97
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,500
No.

98
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:44,475
Have you spoken
to her boyfriend Rob?

99
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,745
Yeah. Yeah, we've spoken to him.

100
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:58,322
I thought I should call you guys
because, um,

101
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,390
well, on reflection, there are
a couple of things that happened

102
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:04,995
that night that even I
can't make sense of.

103
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:06,864
And you're just telling us
this now?

104
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,733
Well I didn't think anything
of it at the time, did I.

105
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,168
But now...

106
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,236
What?

107
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,142
Liz is missing.

108
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:19,442
I don't know where she is.

109
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,145
She's not answering her calls.

110
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,153
Liz relapsed at the party.

111
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,224
She's an addict?

112
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,392
Yeah. Well, she was. Erm...

113
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,496
She'd been clean
for three or four months now.

114
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,067
Then something
happened that night.

115
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:46,937
I don't know what.

116
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:51,474
It all started when she spoke
to that fucking nanny.

117
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:14,497
God, I'm bored.

118
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,467
Let's fuck.

119
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,104
I think people might see us.

120
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:22,940
On Claires bed?

121
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,107
No, absolutely not!

122
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,376
Rob, come on.

123
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,513
Don't be so square.

124
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:32,049
Hey, I am not square.

125
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,083
I'm actually very well rounded.

126
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,420
You're lucky you're funny.

127
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,088
Or what? You wouldn't
date my ugly arse?

128
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,459
I like your ugly arse.

129
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,928
Like. I see.

130
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,865
'Cause I love yours.

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,970
What the fuck is she looking at?

132
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:54,938
Who?

133
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,312
The nanny.
She keeps staring at me.

134
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,214
Maybe she fancies you.

135
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:06,015
Probably.

136
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,921
This is so weird.
She's waving me over.

137
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:14,191
Go tell her we don't mingle
with the help.

138
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:18,562
Okay, I better go
and see what she wants.

139
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:19,696
Do you want me to come with you?

140
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:20,931
No.

141
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:25,269
Fine, I'll just mingle
with myself.

142
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:34,978
They went outside for a chat,
a cigarette, I don't know.

143
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,048
And, um, when she
came back, she...

144
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,552
it was like a light
had switched.

145
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:44,221
She started spiralling.

146
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,235
Hey, hey, hey, slow down.

147
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,305
What happened?

148
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:05,742
I don't wanna talk about it.

149
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,279
Come on, Liz, caring
is sharing, remember.

150
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,484
Fuck off, Rob.

151
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,259
I'm worried about her.

152
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,134
Liz has been known
to hang out with some pretty

153
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:35,072
dark, shady people.

154
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,942
What kind of shady people?

155
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:45,081
Dealers, addicts, loan sharks,
you name it.

156
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,550
Fuck sake!

157
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,518
Damon!

158
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:50,620
I knew it, they want Liz, she
owes them money or something.

159
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,556
I'll call her.

160
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:53,657
Yeah, call her. Call her now
and tell her to get over here!

161
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,527
Did you speak to her that night?

162
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,428
Briefly.

163
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,399
Liz, call me when you get this.

164
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:06,436
It's urgent.
I'm worried about you.

165
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:09,640
Call me back. It's Claire.

166
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,277
What did she say
to you that night?

167
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:36,266
Hey big sis, how's tricks?

168
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,168
You okay?

169
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:43,374
Mhmm, I'm great.

170
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:49,513
I am fucking hunky-dory.

171
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:02,826
I'm Elizabeth.

172
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,062
Roma.

173
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:06,296
Homer.

174
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:07,430
Ro-ma.

175
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,034
Roma, oh.

176
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:17,606
Ha, ha, ha, you're French.

177
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,641
Oui.

178
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:21,510
Oui.

179
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,480
And this must be your dad?

180
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,284
He's my lawyer.

181
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:31,788
Oh.

182
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,759
I need me one of those.

183
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:42,732
Pfft, why is everyone
so fucking serious?

184
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,468
This is supposed to be a party!

185
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,870
Loosen up!

186
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,874
She absolutely humiliated me
in front of Andre.

187
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,343
Remind me who Andre is.

188
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:57,480
He's a French ambassador.

189
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:01,183
We were lucky
to have him in our home.

190
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:05,422
How did you meet Damon?

191
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,596
At a Pharma conference in Paris.

192
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:16,867
Oh, so you're into
pharmaceuticals then?

193
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,201
Sometimes.

194
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,437
Yeah.

195
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,474
Me too.

196
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:35,918
Excuse me.

197
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,791
It's the wife.

198
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:44,427
Judge Judy's just finished,
she'll probably be bored.

199
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:46,697
So.

200
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:49,633
Do you mind?

201
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,536
Tell me more about Roma.

202
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:54,437
I'm sorry, why do you
want to know about Roma?

203
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,308
'Cause Liz stole his phone.

204
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:02,145
I'm sorry what?

205
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:05,915
She stole his phone.

206
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,349
Hi, I, uh, sorry to interrupt.

207
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,684
Liz, can I have a minute?

208
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:47,923
Robert, can't you see I'm in
the middle of a conversation?

209
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,194
Yes, I noticed.

210
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,429
Roma.

211
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,330
Hi, I'm Robert, Liz's
long term boyfriend.

212
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,398
Ugh.

213
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:58,400
What's with all the labels, eh?

214
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,471
Do you mind if I
steal her for a second?

215
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:03,607
Please.

216
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,911
Thank you. Liz, a quick word.

217
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,754
I'll be right back.

218
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:20,823
I won't keep her for long.

219
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,702
What do you want?

220
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:34,838
What is this?

221
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,009
What's what?

222
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,778
What's happening? Even for you,
this isn't normal.

223
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:49,318
Then get with the
fucking program.

224
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:50,487
Ooh!

225
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:55,658
Rob.

226
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:03,066
I'm never gonna be
who you want me to be.

227
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,533
You are who I want.

228
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,769
You don't know me.

229
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,802
I know enough.

230
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:09,639
You don't know my past.

231
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,976
Your past is what makes
you who you are,

232
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,645
the person that I love.

233
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,751
Robert.

234
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,488
You're a nice guy.

235
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:28,757
And you think people
are good inside

236
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:33,797
but they're all fucking rotten.

237
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,134
I'm rotten.

238
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,504
Hey, hey, no, no, no,
you are not rotten.

239
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:50,146
Look, fuck off, Rob.

240
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:09,425
Liz, open up.

241
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:12,461
Liz!

242
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:25,007
You need a leash, no?

243
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:39,154
It's not what it looks like.

244
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,824
Then what the hell is it? Hm?

245
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:51,601
Shh! It's a honey trap.

246
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,603
Liz, what the fuck is going on?

247
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:03,111
He is a very bad man.

248
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,086
Fuck sake! Fucking
phone's locked!

249
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,122
What's on his phone
that's so important anyway?

250
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:19,863
Mariam?

251
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,731
Mariam?

252
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,734
Keep it down, Olivia's sleeping.

253
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,238
Why do you want Mariam anyway?

254
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:33,776
What you doing?

255
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,833
Where the fuck is Mariam?

256
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,636
Why did Mariam
go out that night?

257
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,904
Didn't she already
tell you this?

258
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:03,740
Mhm.

259
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:06,775
We'd like to hear your version.

260
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:14,317
Something about a boyfriend.
Why what did she tell you?

261
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:17,052
Just that she went
to the cinema. Alone.

262
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,057
Well, why would she lie?

263
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:22,991
An even stranger
question would be

264
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:27,096
why would she ask Liz to steal
Roma's phone and then leave?

265
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,671
Do you have a way
we can contact her?

266
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,114
I've dealt with Romanians

267
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:46,682
in Vice before,
they're absolute scum.

268
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:49,685
Bit fucking racist, innit?

269
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,154
Racist? You have no idea what
these people are capable of.

270
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,857
All right, 'cause I
was born yesterday.

271
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,561
Danny, they're major
human traffickers.

272
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,364
He's a weird cunt, ain't he.

273
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,231
That's the victims father.

274
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:04,367
Exactly.

275
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,802
Careful, Danny.

276
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,105
We have her online.

277
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:18,748
Okay, so run us through

278
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,049
everything that
happened that night.

279
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,685
I told you everything.

280
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,019
Well tell us again.

281
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:27,757
I don't have much time.

282
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,826
Well, make time.

283
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:31,059
Or we'll have your
Romanian police

284
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,961
ship you over here so fast,

285
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:34,163
you won't even have time to
take the Goulash off the stove.

286
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:39,902
Why must you speak to me
like this?

287
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:41,903
Probably because
you hopped on a flight out

288
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,673
during a major investigation.

289
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,340
I had to see my daughter.

290
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,644
Yeah, lucky you.

291
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:57,653
I put Olivia to bed.

292
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:06,096
Do your parents
let you use that?

293
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:09,231
They don't care.

294
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:10,934
I care, delete please.

295
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,836
Now.

296
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,905
Time for bed, Mariam.

297
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:19,142
Darling, how do I look?

298
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,176
Good. Very good.

299
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,879
You sure?

300
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:23,980
You look perfect.

301
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:26,850
Ready?

302
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:25,474
I loved her
like my own daughter.

303
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:28,077
Loved?

304
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:30,546
Love. Yes.

305
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:34,017
No, you said 'loved',
past tense.

306
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:39,321
My English is not so good.

307
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:44,126
Yeah, it sounds pretty good
to me. But please, continue.

308
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:56,004
What is it?

309
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:01,310
I had an accident.

310
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:08,850
I should inform your mother.

311
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:10,920
She's busy with her friends.

312
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,521
She doesn't care anyway.

313
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:14,423
I don't think that's true.

314
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:20,429
We need lady pads. You know?

315
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:21,830
Maybe check her bathroom.

316
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:26,102
I changed her bed sheets.

317
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:29,338
I gave her the tampons
and she went to bed.

318
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,975
And I didn't see her again.

319
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:34,811
Because you went out?

320
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:35,945
Yes.

321
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,145
To the cinema?

322
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:38,214
Yes.

323
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:39,449
What did you see?

324
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,319
Nothing.

325
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:46,489
Nothing, good film that.

326
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,456
I think I might have seen it.

327
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,960
I had something to eat instead.

328
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:54,364
A nice slap-up meal with the
boyfriend? What's his name then?

329
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,835
I don't have a boyfriend.

330
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:02,204
Hm, no labels?
Well it is 2020 after all.

331
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,007
What?

332
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,844
Claire said...

333
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:10,312
that you went out
to see your boyfriend.

334
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:14,083
What? No. No, I was alone.

335
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:15,283
So she's lying?

336
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,551
Yes.

337
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:20,990
This is getting
fucking interesting.

338
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:24,326
Wait. You think I did this?

339
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,035
Of course, blame
the poor Romanian,

340
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,270
we are all peasants
who you cannot trust.

341
00:28:35,304 --> 00:28:38,074
Sorry, the race card isn't
gonna work with us, Mariam.

342
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:42,310
Well, this country did vote
for fucking Brexit, didn't it.

343
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:46,382
You know nothing.
I was trying to help Olivia.

344
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:49,351
Mama.

345
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:51,421
Who's that?

346
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:53,521
My daughter.

347
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:57,227
Can we see her?

348
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:58,894
No.

349
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:12,175
You really want
to know what happened?

350
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:14,944
We really, really do.

351
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:19,115
You think you do,
but do you really?

352
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,519
What is this a trick question?

353
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:26,088
Yes, we really do want to know.

354
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:29,692
And you swear you will
protect my family?

355
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,028
We pinky promise.

356
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,498
Assholes.

357
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,440
Okay, here is the truth.

358
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:48,711
Well, we're strapped in.
Where's Olivia?

359
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:57,553
Ask her fucking parents.

360
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,629
This is a nice house Mr. Truman.

361
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:44,799
Thank you. Could be better.

362
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,970
Okay, let's discuss.

363
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,538
We've considered a price.

364
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:52,407
Good.

365
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:55,244
Twenty thousand per meeting.

366
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:01,217
No, no, no, this is too much.

367
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,487
Really? I think
we all know it's not.

368
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:08,557
For me, Olivia
is nothing special.

369
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,562
Well, if that was the case,

370
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,198
you wouldn't have
travelled all this way.

371
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,567
She's good isn't she?

372
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,168
We just want a good deal.

373
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,070
Fifteen is a good deal.

374
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:23,439
Seventeen.

375
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:27,143
Seventeen and we'll
prep and drug her.

376
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:31,814
She won't remember a thing.

377
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,616
That's a funny story.

378
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:40,156
Of course, who would believe
an immigrant woman

379
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,125
over a respectable
British family?

380
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,192
I do.

381
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,363
I do!

382
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:49,664
But then again I love
a conspiracy theory.

383
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:53,502
You know, like, 9/11
was an inside job.

384
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:56,205
You mock me,
but there is evidence.

385
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:59,475
I know, like the steel beams
and the thermite,

386
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:01,876
I've seen all the documentaries.
I know all about it.

387
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,649
No. Roma's phone, idiot.

388
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:13,556
Seventeen. Agreed. Now,

389
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:19,095
this phone has recorded
everything we just said.

390
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:25,301
So if we go down, you go down.

391
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,269
C'est compris?

392
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:38,313
People don't understand
this kind of thing.

393
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,648
We have to be careful.

394
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:42,351
I do.

395
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:44,787
My sister and I were given
this kind of love

396
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:45,887
from our own father.

397
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:48,490
We were always careful.

398
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,563
Champagne?

399
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:17,586
You see this?
This is my shocked face.

400
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:20,155
And this is my
'I call bullshit' face.

401
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:28,463
I knew no one would believe
me, so I needed evidence.

402
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,555
You think this is funny?

403
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,628
Mary - what's your name?

404
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:02,298
Mariana, you call me Mariam.

405
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,833
Mariana, Mariam, whatever.

406
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:10,438
In this country, we
don't sell our children.

407
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:11,774
Where are you from?

408
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:13,876
Romania.

409
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,681
Romania. Do they sell
children in Romania?

410
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,549
Probably.
On eBay, right?

411
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,452
They do everywhere.

412
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:25,688
Now, why are you telling me,
of all people?

413
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,692
Because you know what it's like.

414
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:36,464
And how would I know
what it's like?

415
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,302
You were abused by your father.

416
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:44,473
I heard Damon
tell it to the men.

417
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,643
Yeah, they recorded
everything on their phone.

418
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:49,878
Just fucking be quiet
for a second.

419
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,414
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

420
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:56,652
I'm sorry.

421
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:57,719
Who are you?

422
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:58,921
What?

423
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,923
I said who the fuck are you?

424
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:03,225
I'm the nanny.

425
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,427
Who sent you?

426
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,795
Nobody!

427
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:07,663
Did they send you
to fuck with me?

428
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:09,364
Nobody sent me!

429
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,932
I'll burn your fucking
eye out you fucking cunt!

430
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:12,601
Stop, please! I just
want to help Olivia, okay!

431
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:15,003
Damon is doing
the same thing to her.

432
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:17,772
I just want him to stop, okay.

433
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:19,242
Fucking liar!

434
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:21,844
Are you lying to me?

435
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:23,712
No. No!

436
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,594
Come on. Please.

437
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:48,931
I fucking love this Liz.

438
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,701
Jesus Christ!

439
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:56,771
Don't she know I go to work
to get away from her?

440
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:58,673
Take five, ladies.

441
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:04,512
Carly, what's the emergency?

442
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,715
You working?

443
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:09,418
No, I'm on a beach in Barbados.

444
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,985
Yeah, well I
wouldn't put it past you.

445
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:14,489
What's the matter? You bored?

446
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,425
'Cause I can throw these quips
at you all day long if you want.

447
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,394
I'm sure the little girl
will find herself.

448
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,463
And what about
your child's missing father?

449
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:24,367
Oh, brilliant.

450
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:32,974
I'm actually in her
room right now.

451
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,109
Whose?

452
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:36,177
Olivia's.

453
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:39,213
Poor girl.

454
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:43,184
Yeah, the decor's awful.
The parents are monsters.

455
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:46,688
I got a phone call today.

456
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:49,190
Oh, yeah? Well I've
had about ten from you.

457
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:52,227
Oh, well fine.
I won't tell you.

458
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,730
No, go on.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

459
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:55,931
No, just forget it.

460
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,700
Babe.

461
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,035
No, look, if you wanted
to marry your work,

462
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:01,737
then maybe you shouldn't
have married me.

463
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:02,871
Twat!

464
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:16,851
Sorry about that.
Right, where were we?

465
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,087
Big-wig paedophile politicians.

466
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,690
Oh, my favourite.
Come on, indulge me.

467
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:24,893
What?

468
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:26,728
Give me what you've got.

469
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,996
What's wrong with him?

470
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,499
Many things.

471
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,701
Tell me more about the nonce.

472
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:34,735
Holloway, fuck off, will ya!

473
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:36,204
What?

474
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:38,539
Who was the man that
you went out to see?

475
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,208
There is no man.

476
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,744
Come on now,
you're a pretty girl.

477
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:46,615
There's no significant other?
No friend with benefits?

478
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,784
I don't have time for this.

479
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:54,289
See now, what I really
want to know is

480
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:57,125
if you claim to care
about Olivia so much,

481
00:38:57,157 --> 00:39:00,528
if you love her like a mother,

482
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:01,896
then why the fuck
would you leave her

483
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:03,498
in a house full of pedophiles?

484
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,242
Because he -

485
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:15,911
Speak up, please.

486
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,782
Because he
threatened my daughter.

487
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:24,753
Who did?

488
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,724
That evil piece of
shit Damon Truman.

489
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:02,057
What are you doing?

490
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:04,259
She was thirsty.

491
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,127
I'll take care of her.

492
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,764
It's all right, daddy's here.

493
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,702
Goodnight, sweetheart.

494
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:17,940
Can we talk?

495
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,248
We have a strange request.

496
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:29,684
We need you to go
out for the night.

497
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:31,586
Cinema, or something. My treat.

498
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:34,923
Why?

499
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,925
Well, after the party, Claire

500
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,260
and I would like
some alone time.

501
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,963
For my birthday.

502
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:43,298
I won't bother you.

503
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:47,068
Sure, sure, but

504
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,869
we'd just like to have
the house to ourselves

505
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,039
for a few hours. You understand?

506
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,311
No.

507
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,780
No, you don't understand? Or -

508
00:40:58,813 --> 00:40:59,981
No, I'm not leaving.

509
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,818
Well, Mariam we pay you.

510
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,253
To protect Olivia.

511
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:07,255
So I will.

512
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:09,358
Protect her from who?
Her parents?

513
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:11,594
She doesn't need protection
from the people who love her.

514
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,731
You may have people
fooled but not me.

515
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:20,736
What does that mean?

516
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,606
I heard everything.

517
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:29,143
Everything?

518
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,613
Everything.

519
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:43,057
Okay.

520
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,029
How much?

521
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:51,732
How much money do you want?

522
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,001
I'm not for sale.

523
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,102
Two thousand pounds.

524
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,170
Get out of my way.

525
00:41:55,202 --> 00:41:56,237
Three.

526
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,839
Get out of my way.

527
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:58,973
Four thou-

528
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,775
Move or I'll scream.

529
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,844
I know you have a child
at home that needs the money.

530
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,413
How dare you speak about her?

531
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:06,315
How dare you talk
about my daughter!

532
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:14,823
A child deserves love,
have you none in your heart?

533
00:42:16,224 --> 00:42:18,226
Oh, I love my daughter.

534
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,427
You don't know how to love.

535
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,695
Wait!

536
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:22,329
Get out of my way!

537
00:42:22,362 --> 00:42:24,265
And if I don't?

538
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:26,333
I'm calling the police.

539
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,940
Don't scream.

540
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:37,311
- Don't!
- No, please!

541
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:38,946
Don't fucking move!

542
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:50,057
Now, I don't wanna hurt you,

543
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,795
but you are not gonna be the
downfall of my family.

544
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:57,032
Those men, they're
not just anybody.

545
00:42:58,565 --> 00:42:59,867
Andre,

546
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:03,038
well let's just say his family

547
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,839
are considered
royalty in France.

548
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:09,778
Roma, he's a bit shadier.

549
00:43:11,411 --> 00:43:13,814
He protects people like Andre,

550
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:15,851
he protects them
from regular people

551
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:18,153
like you.

552
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:24,526
When people like you
meddle with people like him,

553
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,762
all sorts of horrible
things happen to them.

554
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:32,134
They fall down elevator shafts.

555
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,135
They're shot by
some crazed gunman.

556
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,139
Many commit suicide.

557
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:44,313
See, what you are doing, Mariam,
is you are committing suicide.

558
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,117
And then, who knows,

559
00:43:49,818 --> 00:43:52,054
your daughter might
fall into the wrong hands.

560
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:56,791
Please.

561
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,929
Take the night off.

562
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:10,304
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

563
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:11,807
God, I'm loving this case.

564
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,908
I'm loving it!

565
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:28,590
Aw. You dropped the cakes.

566
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:39,000
How much did you hear?

567
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:42,036
Only the part about us
being psychopathic pedophiles.

568
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,211
Mm, these are good.

569
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,648
You know she's lying, right?

570
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:55,150
I suspect so.

571
00:44:55,182 --> 00:44:58,485
Andre is a very decent guy.

572
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:01,522
We are decent people.

573
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:03,090
Were you abused by your father?

574
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:07,496
Excuse me?

575
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:12,367
Sorry- were you
abused by your father?

576
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,336
That's a bit crass!

577
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:20,909
Of course I wasn't.
And neither was Liz!

578
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,580
My father loved us.

579
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:29,851
It depends what you call love.

580
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:34,956
Holloway, can I have a word?

581
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,496
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

582
00:45:41,528 --> 00:45:44,266
What? I'm hungry.
I haven't had any breakfast.

583
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:47,001
Is this a joke to you?

584
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,637
Little word of advice.
Don't get too emotionally

585
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,306
attached, it's only gonna
cloud your judgement.

586
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,075
You could be a wee
bit more delicate.

587
00:45:58,112 --> 00:46:00,215
Do you think a bloodhound
lets its feelings

588
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:01,450
get in the way of its nose?

589
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,518
No.

590
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:07,454
You're no bloodhound,
and you're acting like a prick.

591
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,723
The parents are
the victims as well.

592
00:46:09,757 --> 00:46:13,628
There's only one victim
here and she's missing.

593
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:16,063
No!

594
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:20,434
What's happened?

595
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:21,569
Turn the telly on.

596
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:28,108
We're live in Claygate

597
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,644
where police have
discovered a body.

598
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:32,413
Chief Superintendent Hanson

599
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,151
is making a statement
now. We'll pass you over.

600
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:40,021
One of the search and rescue
teams found a body

601
00:46:40,054 --> 00:46:42,023
in the wooded
area of Claygate.

602
00:46:43,423 --> 00:46:45,626
We've sent our forensic team
and pathologist

603
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:47,394
to try and identify the body.

604
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:50,030
However it is yet to be
confirmed whether

605
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:52,366
it's the missing girl
Olivia Truman or not.

606
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,635
Chief.

607
00:46:55,436 --> 00:46:57,005
Is it her?

608
00:46:57,038 --> 00:47:00,074
Probably. Are you
with the Trumans?

609
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,409
Yep.

610
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:02,577
Try and keep them away
from the press.

611
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,079
They're not going anywhere.

612
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,148
I've spoken to the nanny.

613
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:08,449
And?

614
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:10,618
She's claiming
it was the parents.

615
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,253
Pretty fucking convincingly too.

616
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:15,757
Any evidence?

617
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,391
No, not yet.

618
00:47:17,425 --> 00:47:22,397
Right, then do me
a favour. Back off.

619
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:25,500
You're great at finding people
but this is national.

620
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:29,304
All eyes are on us.
The parents are the victims.

621
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:31,239
Yeah, well there's a
kooky little demographic

622
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:32,606
in this country that
agree with me

623
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,641
and think they're
suspect as fuck.

624
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:37,211
I'm not gonna have my people
come under fire

625
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:39,179
for harassing the victims.

626
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,548
Babysit the parents
but do not pursue

627
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:44,286
any line of questioning
with them. Clear?

628
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:46,387
Crystal.

629
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,598
Fuck.

630
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:27,422
I just found these upstairs.

631
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:31,425
Oxycodone, whose are they?

632
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,829
Mine. I've got sciatica.

633
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:38,266
Damon, you're a chemist -

634
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:39,800
I'm in pharmaceutical sales.

635
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,435
Same thing.

636
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,771
What's the side effects
on a drug like that?

637
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,373
There's many.

638
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:46,775
Let's say on a child.

639
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:51,645
Drowsiness. Sleepiness.

640
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:52,847
Death?

641
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:56,885
In some rare cases.

642
00:49:56,918 --> 00:49:59,653
Holloway, the body
hasn't been identified yet.

643
00:49:59,686 --> 00:50:02,623
Oh, that's right! 'Cause
she's still out there, eh?

644
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:07,262
'Cause Romanian traffickers
came into your house,

645
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,465
in the middle of a party, and
took her from under your noses.

646
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,639
Bloody immigrants,

647
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:19,474
first they're taking our jobs

648
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:21,709
and now they're
taking our children.

649
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:22,977
Is this funny to you?

650
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,679
I can assure you it's not.

651
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:29,384
I'd like you to leave my house.

652
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:32,887
You know, it's almost like
you don't want us to find her.

653
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,193
Let's hope you
never have to pull

654
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:40,295
your daughter out of the ground.

655
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,502
We should leave.

656
00:50:58,478 --> 00:51:00,447
I'm telling you, they did it.

657
00:51:00,481 --> 00:51:01,716
You've lost your mind.

658
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:03,717
Clearly.

659
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:05,353
You know, this is
what happens

660
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:06,588
when you let a psychopath
gaslight you.

661
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:08,823
So, you agree. He's a cunt.

662
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:10,659
I was talking about Mariam.

663
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:14,796
I saw it in his eyes.

664
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,300
Do you know what a young
British girl with blonde hair

665
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,403
and blue eyes is worth
to human traffickers?

666
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:26,641
Take a guess.

667
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:28,909
I dunno, a million rubles?

668
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:30,945
A hundred grand.

669
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:33,481
They use nannies like
Mariam to research their hosts

670
00:51:33,514 --> 00:51:36,751
for months and months waiting
for the right time to strike.

671
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:39,554
And what better time
than the night of a big party?

672
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:42,690
A night when dozens
of people will be suspects.

673
00:51:42,722 --> 00:51:44,358
Olivia just happened
to go missing

674
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:46,960
on this night of all nights.

675
00:51:46,994 --> 00:51:50,365
What you're seeing in his
eyes is anger, Danny.

676
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:54,369
Anger that any man would feel
for losing a child. Even you.

677
00:51:57,538 --> 00:51:59,407
Fucking hell.

678
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,810
I gotta answer this.

679
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:08,649
You all right, babe?

680
00:52:08,682 --> 00:52:09,951
Not really.

681
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:12,019
Look, sorry about earlier.

682
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:19,293
I know I've not been around
much, it's just this case.

683
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,895
Yeah, look, it's not what
I called about.

684
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,998
I had an odd phone call.

685
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,632
Go on.

686
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,702
Some bloke asked
"how's your daughter?"

687
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,038
What?

688
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,373
Yeah.

689
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:34,574
Carly, where's Lucy?

690
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:36,611
She's at school.

691
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:39,713
Do me a favour.
Go and get her from school.

692
00:52:41,514 --> 00:52:42,683
Take her straight to your mum's.

693
00:52:42,717 --> 00:52:44,018
Should I be worried?

694
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,020
No, there's nothing
to worry about.

695
00:52:48,155 --> 00:52:51,693
Listen Carly, go upstairs,

696
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:53,994
right hand side of the wardrobe,
top shelf,

697
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:56,063
there's a little
case in the corner.

698
00:52:56,097 --> 00:52:57,799
The key to that case

699
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:58,766
is on the little elephant,
my side of the bed.

700
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:03,771
Don't freak out but
there's a gun in there.

701
00:53:03,804 --> 00:53:05,539
Jesus, Dan!

702
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:07,141
Listen, it's just a precaution.

703
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:08,809
I'm sure it's someone just
playing silly buggers.

704
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,377
Can't you come home?

705
00:53:11,978 --> 00:53:15,615
Go and get her. Okay?

706
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:16,884
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

707
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:17,951
Yeah, got it!

708
00:53:28,027 --> 00:53:29,663
What?

709
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:30,765
What?

710
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:32,666
Rob's called, Liz is back.

711
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:33,768
Right.

712
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:16,677
Here, get that down you.
Come on.

713
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:20,047
That's it. There we go.

714
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:24,151
Can we ask you a
few questions, please?

715
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:27,922
This isn't the best time, is it?

716
00:54:27,954 --> 00:54:32,025
Oi! Wakey wakey.

717
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,598
Roma's phone. Where is it?

718
00:54:38,264 --> 00:54:40,867
Rob, who are they?

719
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,438
We're your ghosts of Christmas
past, love. Time to wake up.

720
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:49,978
Do you have Roma's phone?

721
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:56,082
Liz?

722
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:58,686
Liz, there's probably
nothing on that phone.

723
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:00,454
And it's possible Mariam
just sent you

724
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:03,924
on a wild goose chase but
we need to verify it.

725
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,661
To clear your sister's
name and also

726
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:09,831
start the process of extraditing
Mariam back from Romania.

727
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:15,603
But what if -

728
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:19,473
but what if there
is something on it?

729
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,177
Well, is there?

730
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:28,516
It was locked.

731
00:55:29,817 --> 00:55:32,487
I can unlock it.

732
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:35,021
Yeah, I can just plug it into
my laptop, run some software.

733
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:36,957
There's Gecko, Redsnow.

734
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:41,161
You're a bit of a geek, yeah,
kinda got that. Well.

735
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:43,664
You get the phone, you
grab your laptop. Chop, chop.

736
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:50,505
Don't you have your own
people to do this sort of thing.

737
00:55:50,538 --> 00:55:52,706
Yeah, well, you've offered now.

738
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,976
I just wanna make sure
I'm not breaking any laws.

739
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,113
As far as you're concerned,
I am the fucking law.

740
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:00,748
Then you'll know
all about privacy

741
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,717
and investigatory powers then,
won't you.

742
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,284
Just unlock the phone.

743
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:05,553
Okay.

744
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:09,590
Hanson.

745
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:12,594
Yes, sir?

746
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:15,230
At Rob Tyler's flat, sir.

747
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:20,235
They asked us to leave.

748
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:24,538
Why, what's happened?

749
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:30,645
Is it her, sir?

750
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,018
Right. Okay, keep me posted.

751
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:43,224
He wants us back
at the Truman's.

752
00:56:43,257 --> 00:56:44,858
He's gonna meet us there.

753
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:47,127
I'm not leaving this here.

754
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:49,030
Pack it up. You're
coming with us.

755
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:52,066
What's happened?

756
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,672
Police have confirmed
that the body is that

757
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,009
of a young girl between
the age of ten and fifteen.

758
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,878
But they're reluctant to say
if it's Olivia Truman

759
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:08,148
until it's been identified by
the pathologist and the parents.

760
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:43,217
It's not been confirmed yet.

761
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,751
How many dead children

762
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,987
do you know that are
in those woods?

763
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:04,170
How long's this gonna take?

764
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:06,273
I dunno. It's a
fingerprint lock

765
00:58:06,306 --> 00:58:08,842
which makes it a little
more complicated.

766
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,311
I thought you were an expert.

767
00:58:10,344 --> 00:58:12,913
I work in IT, not GCHQ.

768
00:58:12,945 --> 00:58:14,382
Yeah, well you've
got ten minutes.

769
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:17,318
I'll do my best.

770
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:19,653
Ten minutes or I'll arrest you
for withholding information.

771
00:58:19,686 --> 00:58:21,288
And what information
is that exactly?

772
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,956
The information on that phone.

773
00:58:24,925 --> 00:58:26,027
Such a dick.

774
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:44,278
Liz.

775
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,349
Mariam told us you were
abused by your father.

776
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:52,286
Is it true?

777
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:54,954
Danny, I don't think
now's the time!

778
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:56,423
Am I not being delicate enough?

779
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:04,265
Listen to me, Liz,
I like you. You're honest.

780
00:59:04,297 --> 00:59:06,966
You know, apart from
banging that slick Frenchman

781
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,003
in the toilet behind your
boyfriends back of course.

782
00:59:10,403 --> 00:59:13,306
But I know why you did that.

783
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,278
It was to get that phone.
Because you've got integrity.

784
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:23,917
See, Liz, despite all your
flaws, you're a good person.

785
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:29,222
Now, I need to know

786
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:32,292
whether your father
molested you or not,

787
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:34,494
which will bring me straight
onto my next question -

788
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:39,267
how the fuck would
Mariam know that?

789
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:48,775
I was asking the same
fucking question.

790
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:12,365
Hey.

791
01:00:12,398 --> 01:00:14,367
Enjoying yourself, I see.

792
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:22,777
It is a party, mommy.

793
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,057
You know, Olivia has your hair.

794
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:41,094
Claire.

795
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:42,929
Yes?

796
01:00:47,434 --> 01:00:51,372
You haven't told anyone about
what happened to us, have you?

797
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:53,807
About what?

798
01:00:56,376 --> 01:01:00,782
You don't speak...
about our past?

799
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:03,818
What past?

800
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:07,488
Dad.

801
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:09,056
What about him?

802
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:11,858
You know, his ways.

803
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:14,194
What ways?

804
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:17,231
Look, I know we've
never talked about it.

805
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:19,567
Talked about what?

806
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:25,972
Claire... he abused us.

807
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:27,574
What?

808
01:01:27,608 --> 01:01:31,278
You're my sister,
you don't have to lie to me.

809
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:33,514
I think those therapists have
been messing with your head.

810
01:01:33,547 --> 01:01:36,083
Don't. Don't. Don't.
Don't do that-

811
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:37,117
Do what?

812
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:38,186
Make out that I'm -

813
01:01:39,253 --> 01:01:40,421
that I'm crazy.

814
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:43,491
Tell me.

815
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:49,462
You can... tell me anything.

816
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,302
Connect with me.

817
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,306
I need to get this
cake to Damon.

818
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:01,342
Do you think he'll like it?

819
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,413
It's not something
I wanted to discuss.

820
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:10,351
Especially not at my
husbands birthday party.

821
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:13,287
So it did happen?

822
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:17,991
That's none of your
fucking business!

823
01:02:26,632 --> 01:02:28,335
Who removed the red ribbon
for Andre?

824
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,472
Was it you or Damon?

825
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:36,210
You know,
I'm thinking it was you.

826
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:02,670
Thirty percent
of all abuse victims

827
01:03:02,702 --> 01:03:04,338
become abusers themselves.

828
01:03:06,273 --> 01:03:08,742
Or they end up with one.

829
01:03:08,775 --> 01:03:10,277
You piece of shit!

830
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:13,212
Whoa! Easy Tiger!

831
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:15,048
You're lucky I don't kill you.

832
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:17,117
Well I wouldn't be
your first, would I?

833
01:03:19,385 --> 01:03:20,554
I want you out of my house.

834
01:03:20,586 --> 01:03:21,554
I'm not going anywhere.

835
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:22,556
Get out of my house!

836
01:03:22,588 --> 01:03:23,623
Admit what you did!

837
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:27,094
You drugged Olivia.

838
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:32,499
What are you doing?

839
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:33,634
She was thirsty.

840
01:03:35,168 --> 01:03:36,971
Then she slipped into a coma.

841
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:42,042
She didn't wake up.

842
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:48,114
Then she died.

843
01:04:03,195 --> 01:04:04,630
Then you called your little pal,

844
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:07,368
Roma, to help you
get rid of the body.

845
01:04:38,331 --> 01:04:42,336
You even opened a window to
make it look like a kidnapping.

846
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:54,315
And then they buried her
in the woods.

847
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:02,588
Go on, admit it.

848
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:06,693
Set your soul free...
if you've got one.

849
01:05:09,262 --> 01:05:10,764
I'm not speaking
with you anymore.

850
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:13,768
From now on,
you can talk to my lawyer.

851
01:05:15,434 --> 01:05:18,471
Danny, stop it.

852
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:20,775
Hello, sir?

853
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,746
Are they sure?

854
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:33,421
I'll let them know.

855
01:05:39,626 --> 01:05:41,161
It's not Olivia.

856
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:42,228
What?

857
01:05:43,396 --> 01:05:44,498
It's not her.

858
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,867
Are they sure?

859
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,635
The pathologist confirmed it.

860
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,240
You seem almost disappointed.

861
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:12,626
So it wasn't Olivia?

862
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:17,463
Is that not done yet?

863
01:06:17,496 --> 01:06:18,665
It's not far off.

864
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,269
Do you really think Claire
and Damon did all that?

865
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:31,512
I mean, I actually think they're
the most boring couple I know.

866
01:06:32,545 --> 01:06:33,681
Shut up.

867
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:00,574
Danny!

868
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:01,608
What? What's the matter?

869
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:05,945
Where've you been?
I've been ringing you!

870
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,513
What is it?

871
01:07:07,547 --> 01:07:08,648
Danny.

872
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,519
It's Lucy.

873
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,655
Where is she?

874
01:07:14,688 --> 01:07:16,423
I don't know.

875
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:17,958
What do you mean you don't know?

876
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,460
She wasn't at school.
The teachers thought

877
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:22,496
that we'd given her a day off.

878
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:24,965
I don't understand.
Carly, where is she?

879
01:07:24,998 --> 01:07:27,467
I don't know, Danny,
she's missing!

880
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,849
Danny, I'm scared.

881
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:46,452
I'll call you back.

882
01:07:47,686 --> 01:07:48,688
Danny-

883
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,335
What?

884
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:04,938
They found the
girl's ID with her.

885
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:09,610
Right?

886
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,213
Hanson wants you
to go down there.

887
01:08:15,282 --> 01:08:16,583
Why does he want me to go?

888
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:22,689
Danny.

889
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:28,027
Costa, what is it?

890
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:35,436
They think it's Lucy.

891
01:09:06,733 --> 01:09:09,536
He protects people like Andre.

892
01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:12,806
When people like you
meddle with people like him,

893
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:15,042
all sorts of horrible
things happen to them.

894
01:09:15,074 --> 01:09:18,511
Who knows, your daughter
might fall into the wrong hands.

895
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:21,547
Let's hope you never have to

896
01:09:21,581 --> 01:09:22,583
pull your daughter
out of the ground.

897
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:59,452
Meeting in London
with Slaughter and May,

898
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,822
Leila, have the contract
ready for my departure.

899
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:05,024
That should be Hanson.

900
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:08,127
I'll get it.

901
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:19,505
That's it.

902
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,612
What did you expect?

903
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:37,758
Is that the phone?

904
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,025
Aye.

905
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:41,060
And there's nothing on it?

906
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:43,697
Just some legal stuff.
Nothing with Damon.

907
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:46,932
Jesus Christ! How could
he get it so wrong?

908
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:50,837
I don't know. He's been
making jokes all day.

909
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:52,805
It's all a joke until
it happens to you.

910
01:10:55,175 --> 01:10:59,645
Well, the good news is Olivia
may still be out there. Alive.

911
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,614
We're extraditing
the nanny right now.

912
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:06,552
Her ex-husband is associated
with known Romanian gangsters,

913
01:11:06,586 --> 01:11:09,623
drug smugglers and even
people traffickers.

914
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:16,563
He probably helped her
set the whole thing up.

915
01:11:18,064 --> 01:11:21,768
This is a French ambassador.

916
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:24,004
Damon is friends
with his lawyer.

917
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,130
The sister is unstable.

918
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:36,890
She was probably abused
as a child. We can use this.

919
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:40,130
How do you know she was abused?

920
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,450
I know from personal experience.

921
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:44,730
Well, you are going
to be the first person

922
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,410
that the police will suspect.

923
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,530
So you must
create a story to turn

924
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:52,210
their attention
onto the parents.

925
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,210
Plant the story like a
seed and watch it grow.

926
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,370
The whole world will believe
that the parents did this.

927
01:12:08,314 --> 01:12:11,251
Take this.
It will help you sleep.

928
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,170
Go in when you are ready.

929
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,330
Is she asleep?

930
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,530
Yes.

931
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:12,945
It's a billion pound industry.
We're at war.

932
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:16,883
I tried to tell Holloway
but he just wouldn't listen.

933
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:20,953
You did your best. I'll be sure
to put you forward for DCI.

934
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:23,823
Thank you, sir.

935
01:13:23,855 --> 01:13:24,891
You deserve it.

936
01:13:26,192 --> 01:13:27,261
Hi.

937
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:30,697
How's my baby boy?

938
01:13:33,632 --> 01:13:36,269
Yeah... I'll be home soon.

939
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:43,543
I know.

940
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:47,848
I just didn't think
they would go this far.

941
01:13:56,021 --> 01:13:57,923
So, you're saying that your
daughter was killed

942
01:13:57,957 --> 01:14:00,260
to stop you from
investigating this case?

943
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:02,828
That's exactly what I'm saying.

944
01:14:02,862 --> 01:14:04,797
Surely, that would only
put more pressure

945
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:06,231
on the criminals, wouldn't it?

946
01:14:06,265 --> 01:14:07,868
Not if they were trying
to send a message.

947
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:11,270
A message to whom?

948
01:14:11,304 --> 01:14:17,176
Everyone. Every detective,
every judge. Everyone.

949
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,712
And what's the message?

950
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:23,317
Not to meddle
with powerful people.

951
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:29,722
But I sent them my own message.

952
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,191
And what message was that?

953
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:41,868
So, after everything
that's happened,

954
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,269
are there any any new suspects?

955
01:14:44,302 --> 01:14:46,038
There's a few, yes.

956
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:48,675
The police have widened
their search to Eastern Europe.

957
01:14:48,707 --> 01:14:50,076
So the police believe that

958
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:52,412
she's part of a
child trafficking ring?

959
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:53,912
They believe so.

960
01:14:53,945 --> 01:14:56,315
Then it's likely
she's still alive.

961
01:14:56,349 --> 01:15:00,819
Yes, it's the only good thing
to come out of all of this.

962
01:15:00,853 --> 01:15:03,957
Of course. It must be
a relief knowing that.

963
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:06,225
Knowing that she's
out there gives us hope.

964
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,328
Do you believe
that you'll still find her?

965
01:15:09,228 --> 01:15:11,097
I believe we will, yes.

966
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:13,400
I have to.

967
01:15:14,332 --> 01:15:16,201
Damon?

968
01:15:16,234 --> 01:15:18,270
I think as long as we can
continue our search globally,

969
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:22,341
then... yes, we'll find her.
One day.

970
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:25,345
We'd like to thank
the public... for all the

971
01:15:25,377 --> 01:15:28,814
support they've shown
us over the last few weeks.

972
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:31,184
And how can others
show their support?

973
01:15:31,216 --> 01:15:34,253
We have a company now
set up, The Olivia Foundation.

974
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:36,789
You can find us at
theoliviafoundation.com

975
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,425
and donate through there.

976
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:41,027
Any help you can give
will help us keep the search

977
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,698
active because... the police
can only do so much.

978
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:48,135
And if Olivia was listening now,
what would you say to her?

979
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:52,204
Stay strong, darling.

980
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:55,942
We will bring you home.

981
01:15:58,978 --> 01:16:00,180
Damon?

982
01:16:01,213 --> 01:16:02,314
Just -

983
01:16:03,815 --> 01:16:05,150
I love you.

984
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,099
Keep that pointed at me!

985
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:30,042
I'm gonna tell
you a little story.

986
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:18,524
See, I'm no better
than the Trumans.

987
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:23,896
I cared more about my progress
than I did my own child.

988
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,300
But not any more.

989
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:32,405
The Romanians didn't do this.

990
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:36,909
There's a very powerful
network of people

991
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,779
buying children straight
from their parents

992
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:43,082
and I'm coming for all of them.

993
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,420
And that includes you, Costa.

994
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:49,122
Okay, that's enough, cut there.

995
