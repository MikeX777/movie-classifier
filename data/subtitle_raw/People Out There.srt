1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,734
PEOPLE OUT THERE

2
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,609
Go on.

3
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,660
Yan, c'mon...

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,970
Yan, hurry up!

5
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,416
Keep a client on as long as possible,
every minute costs money.

6
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,251
Don't be rude to a client
and don't fall asleep while working.

7
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,735
What if she needs to strip?
- That's the most she'll have to do.

8
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,053
She'd smile nicely,
keep conversation going.

9
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,971
And when he comes
ask how's he feeling.

10
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,254
Say you'll miss him. Got it?

11
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,095
How much you gonna pay?

12
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,931
I'm just starting my business.

13
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,019
Prices are low so that we can compete.

14
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,011
60% for you, the rest is ours.

15
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,094
Still got any questions?

16
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,411
I've heard clients often fall for girls,
take them on and get married.

17
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,738
So don't forget about your own prospects.

18
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,014
Hey, Chocolate, you promised, no fucking...
- Have you lost your brains?

19
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,211
How they gonna screw your sister,
through the computer?

20
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,970
OK, Chocolate, I gotcha.
You still here? Get lost.

21
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,135
What am I paying you for, Sanya, for what?

22
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,609
Do you hear me?

23
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,335
Go back to work!

24
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,176
I need fifty sacks by the end of the day.

25
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,219
This scene really cracks me up!

26
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,929
Is he Bullet's bro?

27
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,179
Shorty, you watching this
for the first time?

28
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,371
I forgot it.
What's so hard to answer?

29
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,134
Yeah, it's his bro.
Shut up and let us watch the movie.

30
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,300
Chocolate, what are we
gonna do with the camera?

31
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,411
I got a buyer.
But I can't do it tonight!

32
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,330
Who killed him?

33
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,413
Shut up. Why can't you?!

34
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,536
No, seriously, who killed him?
- That's the last time you're coming over.

35
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,380
And take off your hood.

36
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,817
You are not at home.

37
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,093
Listen, Chocolate,
when can we sell the camera?

38
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,532
Can you for once
do something without me?

39
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,892
Then why are you
pulling a fucking scam on us?

40
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,420
I've got the new business now,

41
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,217
I can't deal with you morons.

42
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,180
Why are you freaking out?

43
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,333
I got a buyer,

44
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,060
you just need to show up.

45
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,776
But we're always doing it together!
- Chill out, we'll go over there.

46
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,531
Just don't harass him too much,
I owe him one.

47
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,090
What if he harasses us?

48
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,020
Chill out. We'll do it as I say.

49
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,617
Look.
- Put that shit down.

50
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,338
We're coming from Chocolate. To you?
- To me. Come over here.

51
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,730
What do you have there?
- A camera.

52
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,214
How much do you want?
- Thirty.

53
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,419
Thirty-five.
- Thirty-thirty-five.

54
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,580
Forty.
- Thirty and we go our separate ways.

55
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,092
It's ridiculous.
Give us forty or we're gone.

56
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,815
Thirty-five. Make up your mind!

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,212
Forty.
- So is it forty or thirty?

58
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,736
Forty.

59
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,979
Forty... I can give you thirty
and you leave it here.

60
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,695
Bye.
- Bye.

61
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,899
Yan, what the fuck?

62
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,490
Thirty it is.

63
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,251
Deal. If it's thirty, then thirty.

64
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,975
Done. It's a deal.

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,650
What are you doing?

66
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,611
What is it?
- Look at it!

67
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,658
Let me help you.

68
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,496
Is it working?

69
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,170
It's working!

70
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,095
Now I'll know everything about you!

71
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,613
I turned on this youtube...

72
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,540
Fucking shit...

73
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,815
And I see Emelyanenko there,
he's this wrestler. And then...

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,576
Russian?
- Sure, he's Russian.

75
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,059
What he was doing...

76
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,419
He was not even speeding up.

77
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,172
He just stood,
hard as a rock, to fight...

78
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,499
What you looking at?
- Pedestrian crossing.

79
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,740
What's that?
- Pedestrian crossing.

80
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,093
For real pederasts!

81
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,694
Listen, eh... So I watch him...

82
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,814
There's this really fat dude,
dunno, kinda American.

83
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,450
Sowhat?

84
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,937
Fat like all the Americans.

85
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,816
And there this black guy, really dark...

86
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,054
Hold on... Look at that creep.

87
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,896
May I ask you?

88
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,457
Can you tell me, what time it is?

89
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,340
I don't have a watch.

90
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,460
Look on your cell.
- I don't have a cell.

91
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,291
Such a pretty girl, modest, too.
Got any cash on you?

92
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,659
Look, the cellphone! C'mon!

93
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,180
So maybe you've got money, too?

94
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,619
Don't bullshit me. If I find it
I'm gonna smash your cunt face!

95
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,490
Give me back the phone!
- What's that?

96
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,660
If you got it out,
so fucking stab me now!

97
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,300
That's it! Let's get lost!

98
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,770
Shorty, go home!

99
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,219
Got the cell? Where the fuck is it?
- Let's go, I got it.

100
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,013
Yan, what's wrong?

101
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,180
Why did you have to fuck
this shit up in our neighborhood?

102
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,617
Just ripped this sucker off.

103
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,298
C'mon! Did you see that fuck-face?
'Got some cash?'-'No, I don't'.

104
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,739
Like a dumb mummy. A dumbass.

105
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,098
Hey, Yan, why'd you split yesterday?

106
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,020
Ilona was pissed off.

107
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,374
I told her, we are over.
Cause of her new job.

108
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,180
She's no hooker!

109
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,290
Not a virgin, either. I'd never
let my sister work for Chocolate.

110
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,011
She's not fucking anyone there,
so she's no slut!

111
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,180
We all need some cash.
Look at your gramps-

112
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,572
he's worked his ass off all his life!

113
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,491
My grandpa is a scientist!
He hasn't shown his ass to anyone.

114
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,372
Without your sis, this fat Chocolate
is not gonna get any damn dough.

115
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,696
Ilona is getting more cash for a week's job
than my mom, who's slaving away 24/7.

116
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,015
I'll get some cash and leave for England.
Then you'll see me making dough.

117
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,251
He'll buy himself a new wheel and a crib
using your sister's and your bitch's ass.

118
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,016
And you'll be left with rubber dicks.

119
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,894
I've got to take a piss.

120
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,218
Go around the corner.
Chickening out?

121
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,659
Let's bet five Lats,
you can't take a leak in that house.

122
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
C'mon, old man...

123
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,536
Well?

124
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,930
Everything's fine?

125
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,571
Did you see the loaded bitch coming in?

126
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,171
Really! They came by that car.

127
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,379
What? Didn't see shit.

128
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,613
So, did you piss?
- Leave me alone!

129
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,617
She looked like a queen.
Like she didn't give a fuck about me.

130
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,692
Checked me out... But turn round
the corner, she'd fuck me gladly.

131
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,934
You wanna rape her?
- Are you a total dickhead? Why rape?

132
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,577
I'd kill all those mother-fucker rapists!

133
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,695
Shoved it up their asses hard.

134
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,535
What's wrong with you?

135
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,091
Move it.

136
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,772
You don't have enough cash anyway,
unless you lift some shit... Let's go!

137
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,138
In London only Indians
are wearing this crap!

138
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,458
You piss me off with your London!

139
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,370
You haven't ever been there,
you don't know shit about it!

140
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,415
Hey, Yan!

141
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,170
Recognize me?

142
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,097
It's me, Robert.
You used to call me Robot at school.

143
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,533
Ah, Robert, hey!
What's up?

144
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm cool.You?

145
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,653
Come and sit with us! We'll chat.

146
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,610
Sure, just a bit later.
- Ok, but do come over!

147
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,097
Yeah, sure.
- Long time no see!

148
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,731
Man, 'long time no see'...

149
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,897
Who's this Robot guy?
- My classmate. Just a regular guy.

150
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,697
Regular guy. 'Listen, come over'...
- My favorite song! Let's dance.

151
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,336
Let's dance.

152
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,539
Nope, I don't dance with hookers.

153
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,019
Have you lost it totally?
I'm not a hooker.

154
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,974
Oh, yes, not a hooker...

155
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,460
Look at yourself. No bitch will put out
for you, either! You look like a hobo.

156
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,699
And what do you think you look like?

157
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,216
Fuck you!

158
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,496
Fuck yourself!

159
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,930
Asshole!

160
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,452
You wanted to rape my sister?!

161
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,819
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

162
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,610
What's your fucking problem?

163
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,450
I'm not your friend anymore, prick!

164
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,295
Let's go!

165
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,180
Here, have some!

166
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,298
How you feeling?
- Awesome.

167
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,058
She's my best friend's sister.
I know him for years.

168
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,652
How could he believe that whore
that I could do something like this?

169
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,930
It beats me why you got
involved with that scum at all.

170
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,691
At school you were just a regular guy.

171
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,410
At school...

172
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,939
Gonna take a leak.

173
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,011
Here's our pretty boy. Cute, eh?

174
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,410
Why did you stare at me?!
I turn you on?

175
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,536
Oh, the dude looks dumbfounded!

176
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,658
Are you mute, faggot?!

177
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,136
Shit...

178
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,213
Hey Yan, what happened?

179
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,015
It's him!

180
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,933
Stop, stop this, it's my turn!

181
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,372
I'm gonna finish him off.

182
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,456
Do you know who you are fighting against?

183
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,697
Run, run, run away!

184
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,980
Robert, come on, let's go.

185
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,691
Hey you, come here!

186
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,616
Me?

187
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,453
Yes, you come here!

188
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,333
But I've done nothing.

189
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,539
C'mon, hurry up!

190
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,656
I failed to bring you up as a decent man.

191
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,213
It's my fault.

192
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,414
You didn't make a good grandson,

193
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,617
me, a good grandpa.

194
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,414
At least your mom didn't live to see it.

195
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,093
Why are you so upset?

196
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,816
It's just a regular roundup.
I just happened to be there.

197
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,097
Don't smoke in front of me.

198
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,296
Gramps!

199
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,614
Gramps!

200
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,615
Yan, why I can't get
a decent night's sleep?

201
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,973
I really need to talk to you.
- I'm so fed up with you.

202
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,140
Please, it's really important.

203
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,614
Yan, I'm cold!

204
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,012
Are you making fun of me?

205
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,296
Grandpa, I'm scared.

206
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,218
I can't go on like this...

207
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,616
The older I am, the harder it gets.

208
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,418
Drop this nonsense.

209
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:08,817
For starters, don't spend
any more time with those bastards.

210
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,451
Eat like a man, you are not a pig!

211
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,137
Why are you not eating?
- I've had enough for a lifetime.

212
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,337
Sit down, tea's getting cold.

213
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,531
Just by chance I found
a photo of your mother.

214
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,977
Wanna hear a funny story?

215
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,697
It was in '83 or in '86.

216
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,459
Our boss, the head of laboratory,
sent us on a business trip.

217
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,417
Not to Ukraine or Kazakhstan
but to Belgium.

218
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,494
We had to participate in a symposium

219
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,412
about the latest achievements
in rock and soil science.

220
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,900
In those times taking a trip abroad,
say nothing of Belgium, was quite an event.

221
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,495
Your mother asked me
to get her a dress in Antwerp.

222
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,610
I spent a whole day
looking for a cheap store.

223
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,537
Don't think I was a cheapskate
but our daily allowance was 10 rubles.

224
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,417
And for that money you couldn't
get even a can of beer.

225
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:04,620
Then I bumped into some store-
the clothes there cost pennies.

226
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,616
So, I got myself a suit
and a dress for your mom.

227
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,174
Week later she called me
to tell that she washed the dress

228
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,131
and it turned into a mush.

229
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:30,498
Later somebody told me the store
was really meant for...corpses.

230
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,818
What do you mean-for corpses?

231
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:41,015
Well you can buy
disposable clothes for the funeral.

232
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,250
They were made of paper.

233
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,534
Where did you get your new cell?
- Bought it.

234
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,418
Hey, Chocolate, cool!

235
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,256
Nothing really, chewing...

236
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,379
No, not today.

237
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,940
My grandpa got into the hospital.

238
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,057
No, nothing serious.

239
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,893
Sure, I'll go there.

240
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,531
OK, see ya tomorrow, bye.

241
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,500
Gramps!
Wait, where are you going?

242
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,017
Shit, tastes like pig's barf.
Shorty, tell me something, eh?

243
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,012
So listen, we have a guy in our class.

244
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,456
He's in the seventh grade,
but he's almost 18 now.

245
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,175
No, really?

246
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,496
He's a weirdo.
No brains whatsoever.

247
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,934
Takes him five seconds
to figure out how much 9 times 9 is.

248
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:05,493
So once, in gym class,
we had to run around the park.

249
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:12,415
We run and run,
passing a kids' playground.

250
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,617
And then I see him
with the friend, he's 16, too.

251
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,651
But it's 7th grade,
so he should be like 13.

252
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:28,093
I run and I saw them
smoking under the apple tree.

253
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,053
Oh, check it out?

254
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,697
It's Chocolate.
He's got new wheels! C'mon!

255
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,619
Man, you like my new car?

256
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:13,738
See the multi-function steering wheel,
tiptronic and carputer...

257
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,098
Stop bugging us!
You gonna break it!

258
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,499
Beats me,
why you gotta touch everything?

259
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,489
Got itchy fingers?

260
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,739
I'll scratch them for you!

261
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,331
A CD player for 6 CDs,
you can turn it on like this, whoops!

262
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:44,413
I can listen to 6 CDs or like
two songs from each disc at the same time.

263
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,615
Hey, it's Yan!

264
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,614
Fuck, why did you slow down? Go!

265
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,735
Chocolate, keep moving!

266
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,292
You two had a fight?
- Yes.

267
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,614
He wanted to rape Ilona!

268
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,570
Are you a total retard?

269
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,095
You are all just fucking morons!

270
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,939
Sabina, what does it matter
who's driving the car!

271
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,611
If Albert sees this, he won't like it!

272
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,375
That's my problem, not yours!

273
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,414
Why are you so worried
what he's gonna think or say?

274
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,375
Sabina, please sit in the car!

275
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,899
Well, Ok!

276
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,377
I really don't understand
why you wish him bad.

277
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,694
I'm not asking you
why you have to kiss his ass, right?

278
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,020
It's enough.

279
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,454
We are going out of town tomorrow.
Remember? I'll pick you up.

280
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,496
I do remember I have my birthday tomorrow.
I really hope he won't show up there.

281
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,933
Don't talk like this about your father.
He's almost a saint!

282
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,613
You do believe in it?
Saints don't get married a second time.

283
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,778
Pull up right here.
I want to take a walk.

284
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,498
Hi, I think you've dropped your key.
- Thank you.

285
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,057
This young man
found my key and returned it.

286
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,253
Thank you so much!

287
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,970
May I walk you to your place?

288
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,696
You can leave your coat
in our coatroom.

289
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,058
No, no, I'm fine like this!

290
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,299
Is it your first time here?
- Yes.

291
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,498
How did you find out about us?
- I have lots of friends here.

292
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,979
There.

293
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,335
Holy Spirit, give us the Word of God
to strengthen our faith.

294
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:45,536
Enter deeply into our soul and spirit.

295
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:57,293
Let us proceed to the Throne of Grace,
so we can be blessed with your help.

296
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,214
We need You, Lord.

297
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,137
We come to You and plead You-

298
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,220
share this night with us.

299
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,534
Lord, give us Love.

300
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,089
We ask you in the name of Jesus:
touch each one of us.

301
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,729
Fill us with wisdom and strength.

302
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,613
Make us victorious in the name of Jesus.

303
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,580
Bless me, Jesus!

304
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:48,217
Now shake hands with your
neighbor and say 'Welcome!'

305
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,174
Good evening.
- Hello.

306
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:11,333
This year is proclaimed as the year
of prosperity, influence, and growth.

307
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,297
We are positive that this year
will bring us lots of surprises

308
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,138
because God has prepared the reward
for those who are humble before Him.

309
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,969
Our new government has declared that

310
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,292
we are a European democratic society,
based on Christian values.

311
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:41,490
Christianity is our wealth and redemption.

312
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:49,931
The one who deeply believes
in God Almighty and in himself

313
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,410
will be successful in this life
and the devil will not seduce him.

314
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,738
You may ask what is evil?

315
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:04,012
And I will give you an answer:
poverty is evil, disease is evil,

316
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,614
everything that makes
human beings unhappy.

317
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,010
Lies, betrayal, greed...

318
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,057
All these are deadly sins
described in the Bible.

319
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,220
But there are always people who are lost,

320
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,340
who need our help and the help of God.

321
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,017
Beloved brothers and sisters,
a man has came here for our help.

322
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,614
He wants to learn how to live.

323
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,214
Yes,Yes! God has kissed his son
and brought him to our church.

324
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,372
Son, don't run away
from your redemption!

325
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,614
My son!

326
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,179
Yes, you!

327
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,574
Don't be afraid, I don't bite.

328
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,571
Come up to the stage.

329
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,136
I want to help you, I see
that you are lost and scared.

330
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,018
Release your heart
from poison and come on up!

331
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,614
Brothers and sisters, let's show
our support to the prodigal son!

332
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:47,812
Take off your baggy sack,
show us, as you are.

333
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:57,692
This young man has done many wrongs.

334
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:08,819
Brothers, this young man is lost,
his life lacks any sense.

335
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,657
He's a thief!
- What you doin'?

336
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,734
Yes, yes-he's a thief!

337
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,135
But, my dear friends, don't plant
seeds of fear and hatred in your hearts.

338
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,539
Don't let Satan enter your hearts.

339
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:28,455
We have to love him in the same way
we'd love our friend, brother or son.

340
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,499
God guided him here, to us,
cause everyone needs help!

341
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,940
This is our mission-
to teach this lost soul

342
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,773
the path of Truth,
just like anyone else who seeks it.

343
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,932
My son, what's your name?

344
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,058
Don't worry,
it's not a police interrogation.

345
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,210
Petya!

346
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,137
Petya! Like Apostle Peter.

347
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,734
He too renounced God,
but Jesus forgave him

348
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,371
and I'll do the same!

349
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,693
Now repeat after me:

350
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:26,699
I'm a sinner, a thief,
I've done many wrong things.

351
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,055
I'm a sinner, done many wrong things.

352
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,014
I'm a thief, I'm a sinner,

353
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,534
I renounce Satan and everyone
else who was my friend.

354
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,417
I'm a sinner...
- I'm a thief!

355
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,220
I'm a thief and I renounce Satan
and everyone else who was my friend.

356
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,217
I open my heart with love to Jesus
and promise to lead a decent life.

357
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,774
I open my heart with love to Jesus
and promise to lead a decent life.

358
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,820
Hallelujah!

359
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,571
Brothers and sisters,
within these walls, Jesus is among us!

360
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,697
Wanna see something cool, Cracker?

361
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,052
Watch this... Here's a movie, whoops!

362
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,609
Split screen, whoops,
and you can watch a concert.

363
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,776
Look, what a pretty woman.
Whoops! A pause!

364
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,616
What a cunt, eh?

365
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,816
Why d'you fucking need it?
You're not gonna watch it.

366
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,135
I've got the sameTV at home,
only a bit bigger.

367
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,817
I've got a new girl starting tomorrow.
Looks exactlylike her!

368
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,452
And your baby girl? When she grows up,
you gonna hire her, too?

369
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,213
My favorite scene with Tupac!

370
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,300
I heard his last song yesterday.

371
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,534
Don't bullshit me, he's dead.
- Think I'm fucking with you?

372
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,336
They told on the radio,
it's his new song.

373
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,976
Stop talking shit at my house!

374
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,732
Chocolate, you really think
I'm total moron?!

375
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,212
Think I heard a corpse singing?

376
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,293
Maybe you heard a corpse.

377
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,456
Fuck you, bitch!

378
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,620
Cracker, chill out.
He's not dead, he's not.

379
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,619
No, Cracker,
Tupac was shot dead for real.

380
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,411
What's all this bullshit in my house?

381
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,776
Go suck your dick, with your TV,
with your car and all your shit!

382
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,093
How comes your wife
is not working for you?

383
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,532
Cause she's not a fucking whore!
Mother-fucker.

384
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,175
She's not a hooker? Look at your
baby girl, the blue-eyed blonde!

385
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,332
Get out of my house!

386
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,378
Told ya, out!
- Shorty, let's go!

387
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,331
Out! You, too!
Dickheads!

388
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,060
Wanna hear something awesome?

389
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,819
In Moscow cops
freed a girl from slavery.

390
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,580
All her teeth were pulled out!
- Again you and your creepy shit.

391
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,337
Wait, you'll never guess
why she didn't have any teeth.

392
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,130
Ok, so what's so funny?

393
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,498
She was the most popular hooker
among the golden boys.

394
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,654
Her blow-job cost 400 euros!

395
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:52,455
Would Ilona agree to give head
for 500 euros, but live without teeth?

396
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,970
Just shut up!

397
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,570
Shorty, shut up!

398
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,416
Like some Parisian, in that coat.

399
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,215
Looks like he's found a job.

400
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,410
Like a Parisian...
Can you just shut up!

401
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,897
Shouldn't you be going now
to show your naked ass?

402
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,013
Unlike you, I'm working
and not sleeping with anyone.

403
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,497
Working... Watch out, so I don't
see you even getting close to Yan.

404
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,937
Gotta go.

405
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,489
Did you get what I said?

406
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,774
What I don't understand is
why you still give a flying fuck about him.

407
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,377
Go, your pimp's calling you.
- Fuck you!

408
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,254
Excuse me, can you tell me
which apartment Sabina lives in?

409
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,333
What do you need her for?

410
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,339
You see, we are classmates.

411
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,018
She invited me for dinner and forgot
to tell me the apartment number.

412
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,890
I'm listening!

413
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,614
I came to see Sabina.

414
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,775
Sabina!

415
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,380
Yes, dad!

416
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,136
Do you know this young man?

417
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,777
No, I'm see him for the first time.

418
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,693
Do you know her?

419
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,176
No.

420
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,980
Then what did you come for?

421
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,695
Come here.

422
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,650
This is for your act today on the stage.

423
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,578
I want you never show up here again.

424
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,299
I don't ever wanna see you again here.

425
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,135
Otherwise I might want
to get my camera back.

426
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,170
Get lost!

427
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,129
Where were you?
- What are you doing here?

428
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,699
Waiting for you.
I want to talk to you.

429
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,016
Yan, what's wrong with you?

430
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,769
Just leave!

431
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,811
What has happened to you?

432
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,293
Can you hear?
Leave me, bitch, get lost!

433
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,611
You are just like a child,
you need a mother.

434
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,934
Are you insane?

435
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,094
Fuck off!

436
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,892
Have you lost your fucking brains?

437
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,892
Are you fucking insane?

438
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:29,616
Pour it in a cup, it's not nice
to drink from the bottle.

439
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,297
Why do you steal my money?

440
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:47,459
Look at yourself, a grown-up man.

441
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,297
Ok, no head on your shoulders
but you've got arms and legs.

442
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,332
Instead of looking for a job,
you steal money from your grandpa.

443
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,615
That's why your own mother left you.

444
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,330
What?

445
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,251
You told me she died.

446
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,740
You, old fucking fart!

447
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,940
Why did you bullshit me my whole life?

448
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,249
You are not the one to blame.

449
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,252
I'm an old man, I don't need a thing.

450
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,572
You, like me, have only desire.

451
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,620
I just wanted someone to be close to me-

452
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:50,173
a grandson, to take care of,
to wash his shitty diapers,

453
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,531
to play with and make up with,

454
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,700
and listen to his stories
that don't make any sense.

455
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:02,540
To my sorrow, you didn't give me
any reason to be proud of you.

456
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,812
You even crapped more than regular kids.

457
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,690
Your mother was so young
and stuck with you on her arms.

458
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,777
I thought that fate has given hope
both to me and to her.

459
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:31,174
But as soon as we got married,
she ran away to Belarus,

460
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:38,777
so she could keep drinking

461
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,655
and be angry at the whole world.

462
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,611
I'm a stranger to you.

463
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:04,896
You'll die the same way you were born.

464
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,050
Bye,Victor, I'll be back late.

465
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,534
Freeze!

466
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:41,334
Listen, buddy, I warned you,
never show up here again.

467
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,617
You can thank me
that I haven't called the police.

468
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,572
I had a good reason for that.

469
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,340
But you told me,
you really want to help me.

470
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:58,574
Do you understand,
you stole money meant for orphans?

471
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:03,209
I stole nothing,
I just came to pick it up.

472
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,739
What the fuck you are doing
hanging out next to my house?

473
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,973
What do you need?

474
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,137
What do you need?!

475
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,133
Hey, it's him!

476
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,140
Stop!

477
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,454
Let him go,
or I'll cut his throat open!

478
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:08,613
Let's go!
- Told ya- run!

479
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,618
Enough!
Let him go!

480
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,058
Listen, we can pull off the last deal.

481
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,539
We can get a shitload of money.

482
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,217
I'm not really sure...

483
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,011
We're gonna get the cash, and you can
leave for England, for your London.

484
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,778
And what are you gonna do?

485
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,779
I'm gonna look for my mother.

486
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:12,172
Tomorrow there's gonna be
some out of town party for the rich kids.

487
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,290
They'll have all their crap to flaunt it-

488
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:19,171
cellphones, cameras, gold maybe, cash...

489
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,578
We're gonna have enough shit to jack.

490
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,136
We just need to get a gun.

491
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,620
A gun?

492
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,051
That's a bit more complicated.

493
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,654
Where you gonna get it?

494
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,219
Let's think.

495
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,212
Maybe from Chocolate?

496
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,098
He's got a huge stash.

497
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,653
From Chocolate...

498
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,260
We're gonna need the wheels, too.

499
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,979
This one seems to have no alarm.

500
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,457
C'mon... break the window!

501
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,778
Let's break a window.
- Shush, shush...

502
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,698
Break, are you fucking nuts?!
We still have to drive it.

503
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,740
We're gonna try to crack it open.

504
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,614
Wanna smoke?
- Sure, let's smoke.

505
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,649
Are they leaving soon?
- Should be leaving by now...

506
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,574
Maybe call them?

507
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,057
Just hold on, we made a deal.

508
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,617
Which window?
- The second one, over there.

509
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,058
Look, he took a different car.

510
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,973
C'mon! What are you waiting for?

511
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,374
Go, go!

512
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,980
Wait, a car.

513
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,700
No or yes?

514
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,374
Go on, work.

515
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,453
Check the ignition.

516
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,614
Did you open it?

517
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,540
Wait, wait...

518
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,620
Fuck, c'mon!

519
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,700
See the green one, try that!
- Fuck, I know!

520
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,018
No, the green one, not the red.
- Hold on!

521
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,054
Wait!
It's gonna start now!

522
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,173
Try the green one, I'm telling you.

523
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,220
Fuck, Cracker, you piss me off!
Wanna get in and do it yourself?

524
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,657
What to do? Dunno.
- What the fuck!

525
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,177
Get in. I'm shutting up.

526
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,698
Gimme some light.

527
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,811
Shit, just shake it!
Fuck knows...

528
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,332
How the fuck did you get here?
Just scram!

529
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,890
Let me in!

530
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,810
Back door, told ya, fast!

531
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,694
Drive away, faster!

532
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,374
Come closer!
You asshole, we almost got caught.

533
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,692
Enough, Cracker, chill out.

534
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,331
I'm gonna pull over now
and you are getting out.

535
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,574
Guys, I really wanna go with you.
Just tell me what to do.

536
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,171
You know where we are going?
- No.

537
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,129
Then, let's pull over, you get out.
Is that clear?

538
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,617
Or do you not understand?

539
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,172
Fine, but listen, Shorty,
can you get a gun?

540
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,300
I can, my papa's got a pistol,
a small caliber

541
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,692
Can you get it for tonight?

542
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,458
Dunno, not easy to pull it off.
My papa's paranoid.

543
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,935
Listen, calm down.
Get a couple of winter hats, too.

544
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,738
Go.
Don't forget the beanies!

545
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,180
And grab a bag, too,
so that we won't get caught.

546
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,012
Yan, why is he there for so long?

547
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,453
Why the hell do we need a pistol?
We are not gonna kill anyone!

548
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,933
Hey, he's coming.

549
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,412
Ok, we done?
- Here's everything. A gun and the hats.

550
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:36,650
Sure? Your folks didn't catch you?
- Nope, nobody saw a thing.

551
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,654
Shorty, come...

552
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,496
Go home now, your parents will worry.

553
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:45,618
I'm coming with you!
Yan, you promised! I'm with you, dudes!

554
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,176
Cracker, wake up! It's them.

555
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,580
What the...?
- Get ready.

556
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,378
I said, gimme the cash!

557
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,931
Let's wait till they are wasted.

558
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,780
Yan, the water is warm.

559
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,935
Are you fucked up?
It's so cold!

560
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,372
No, I'm telling you -water's great!

561
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,329
Fuck, it's so cool! Let's go!

562
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,460
Ok, everyone, shut the fuck up!

563
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,212
Stay put, otherwise
I'll shoot you in the head!

564
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:33,138
Everybody looks aside!
Cast down your eyes!

565
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,460
Where you think you're going, cunt?
Don't move!

566
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,652
Lights on, bitch!
Nobody moves.

567
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,377
Where the fuck are you going?!

568
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,495
I'm gonna explain this only once:

569
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:56,419
take all your fucking money and phones,
and throw it in the bag.

570
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,171
Or I'll fucking stab you!

571
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,616
Is it clear?

572
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:04,417
Guys, just calm down, we can solve it.

573
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,420
Sure, we can!

574
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,578
What are you waiting for?
Faster!

575
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,612
And you, bitch,
why are you still sitting?

576
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,660
You too, fucking cunt!

577
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,016
Come on! What are you staring at?

578
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,175
Get everything out!

579
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,810
I told you, everything!

580
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,096
Hold the gun!

581
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,499
Yan, what the hell?

582
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,211
So you recognized me, right?

583
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,132
Downstairs, when I was still in the mask.

584
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,219
This is the first time I see you.

585
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,693
That's what you said to your father.
Are you ashamed of me?

586
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,770
Don't...

587
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,933
What do you want?

588
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,658
I want to be loved.

589
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,333
You are so pretty.

590
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,217
Hush, hush, you...

591
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,816
Enough!

592
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,489
Take off your shoes!

593
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,137
Take the fucking shoes off! Faster!

594
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,172
This is great, right?

595
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,092
Enough, I told you!
I'll cut your throat, got it?

596
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,977
Enough, shut your mouth.
Just shut it up!

597
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:23,976
I said, enough, bitch!
Didn't you get it? Shut up!
