1
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,057
I hate Punk music.

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,115
Hate it.

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,696
No, it's a good band. A worthy one.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,434
They're better than I expected.
They're crazy.

5
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,104
They're like a bombed-out ruin left-over
from mass destructions.

6
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,073
My glasses are fogging up.

7
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,409
Shonen Merikensack rocks!

8
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,777
I like Akio.

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,978
Jimmy.

10
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,146
Young.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,115
They make me want a Mohawk.

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,552
Like I'd be a complete wimp without one.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,925
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,027
I haven't seen them.

15
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:01,928
I will now.

16
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:05,329
Jimmy's vocals. Jimmy's the best.

17
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,368
Akio's cute.

18
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,137
Love and violence.
Exactly.

19
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,139
Too violent.

20
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,941
They're different.

21
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,543
Shonen Merikensack!

22
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,079
Shonen Merikensack!

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,240
I hate them!

24
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:28,212
Exterminate the human race!
Shonen Merikensack!

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,786
The Shonen Merikensack
- Brass Knuckle Kids -

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,199
Akio.

27
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,672
Haruo.

28
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,214
Young.

29
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,846
Jimmy.

30
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,550
"Talent Search Division"

31
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,037
They're it!

32
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,750
Boss!

33
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,122
I found a killer band!

34
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,424
What?

35
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,693
This is the real deal!

36
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,861
No! Really?
Yes!

37
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,852
Show me!

38
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,268
We've done this routine for 2 years.

39
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,470
But here's your last.

40
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,835
Yes.

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,600
How many "promising" artists have you
and I dug up and buried?

42
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,038
Loads. It was great fun.
Thanks for the memories.

43
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,219
What'll you do?

44
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,358
Help run my father's sushi shop.

45
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,519
Sushi, huh?
Sushi.

46
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,155
Sushi, huh?
Sushi.

47
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,697
Sushi sounds... great.

48
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,503
OK! Show me!

49
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,834
OK!

50
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,835
This is Punk rock.

51
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,081
Is it?

52
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,588
Tell me, Kanna. What's our genre?

53
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,624
Ambient, Okinawan,
club music and guitar pop.

54
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,192
This is?
Punk!

55
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,494
Hardcore punk!

56
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,029
Thanks for everything!

57
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,018
Hold it!

58
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,894
Let's see it.

59
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,473
What're they singing?

60
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,186
Surfin' to pass the time!

61
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,295
What does that mean?

62
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,264
Maybe they like to surf.

63
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,300
Not a chance! What're they called?

64
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,234
Brass Knuckle Kids!

65
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,003
Brass Knuckle Kids!

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,576
You trying to kill me?

67
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,873
Thanks for everything! Bye!

68
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,772
No way!

69
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,217
This kind of trash...

70
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,775
is what I love!

71
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:59,158
Most punk these days is too clean,
too healthy.

72
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,794
They sing sappy songs about youth.

73
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,661
So do you like them or what?

74
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,693
I mean,

75
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,735
I did that.

76
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,802
You were in a punk band, boss?

77
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,537
In my youth.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,908
That's how we started this company.

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,652
The band failed,

80
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,052
but we've built a major record label.

81
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,624
Where's the rest of them?

82
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,894
One's a fisherman. Another does shiatsu.

83
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,988
You're holding our vocalist.

84
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,667
Telya?

85
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,861
The Great Telya!

86
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,961
The Great Telya's leaving!

87
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,766
The Great Telya's leaving!

88
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,207
Wait, back up.

89
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,218
Forward, turning.

90
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,119
Turning.

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,793
Andromeda, is that you?

92
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,919
Don't touch me.

93
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,863
Andromeda, is that you?

94
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,064
You are.

95
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,635
Andromeda, is that you? From the future.

96
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,538
Andromeda,...

97
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,605
I'm turning.

98
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,443
I bend to pick up litter. Then don't.

99
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,847
Elevator here... not here...
it's here... I get in.

100
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,116
I stop... I turn.

101
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,515
Yes... Good night.

102
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,590
Thank you.

103
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,393
Telya and I left the punk scene.

104
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,419
Now he earns 80% of our revenue.

105
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,725
He kept you from being fired.

106
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,165
Oh... thank you.

107
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,739
Then Punk died.

108
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,575
Except as late night TV intro music.

109
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,415
Crappy "fashion" Punk.

110
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,406
What is "Punk"?

111
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,651
Forget it. Never mind.

112
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,558
No, I won't "forget it."
You don't know what "Punk" is?

113
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,197
Not really. I know "Techno"
and "Hip-Hop"

114
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,666
but not "Punk".

115
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,868
What is it?

116
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,603
It's getting butt naked.

117
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,304
Shock value.

118
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,295
Punk is me.

119
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,815
Come again?

120
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,751
Okay, forget it.
But they're the real deal.

121
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,891
I see.

122
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,223
"You're all idiots!"

123
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,818
They really suck.

124
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,391
That's not important.

125
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,502
It's about power, rage and...

126
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,803
bam!

127
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,572
He's hunky.

128
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,908
That's right. You're a homo.

129
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,034
Kanna!

130
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,173
I want you to contact them immediately.

131
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,851
Does it have to be now?

132
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,388
Damn right!
We spent 2 years digging for this!

133
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,591
My farewell party's at 7!

134
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,683
Don't go.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,887
I'm extending your contract.

136
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,369
Thank you!

137
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,239
In exchange, go make an album.

138
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,340
One album!

139
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,975
Just one?

140
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,743
Anyone can cut multiple albums.

141
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,110
Legends are made with one.

142
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,574
Yes!

143
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,444
One more thing!

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,388
I am the boss here.
So don't call me "homo".

145
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,560
Sure, everybody knows.

146
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,431
But I want them to think I don't know.

147
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,796
Life's a bitch.

148
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,266
You're not leaving, then?

149
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,568
Aren't you happy?

150
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,679
I'm happy if you're happy.

151
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,982
Don't you see? If I succeed with this,

152
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,884
I'll earn some clout.

153
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,459
I could get you your big debut!

154
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,792
But you don't like that band?

155
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,264
I hate it.

156
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,900
And yet there's something about them...

157
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,100
something that made me
endure the pain over and over.

158
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,876
What could it be?

159
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,847
Suddenly, I'm jealous of them.

160
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:54,082
I said I hate them.
You're a hundred times better.

161
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:02,294
Sakura, sakura, sakura

162
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,665
Sakura la la la

163
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,733
New song?

164
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,568
It's about you.

165
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,504
Actually, I can't write anything
that isn't about you.

166
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:21,313
Sakura, sakura, sakura

167
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,771
Sakura la la

168
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,986
Sakura, sakura, sakura

169
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,927
"Sakura New Town"

170
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:44,362
Sakura, sakura, sakura

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,145
Remember what you promised?

172
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:02,448
That we'd walk together again

173
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:10,660
Along this cherry avenue,
hands shaking nervously

174
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,722
F-minus!

175
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,097
F-minus!

176
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,610
Boring song, boring voice,
boring face, probably!

177
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,278
He's a hunk. Look!

178
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,379
Boring!

179
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,816
Tell me about the band!

180
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,148
Fine. I found their official Web site.

181
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,988
An A-plus!

182
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,922
What, no phone number?

183
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,127
Born in 1983 means...?

184
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,129
He's 25, same as me.

185
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,723
Borderline. That's okay.

186
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,558
"Yogurt and Chao Fan"?
Ah, favorite foods.

187
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,072
"Fried rice"?

188
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,240
"Chao Fan", right?

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,470
Same thing.
He's baka.

190
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,913
Look, the hunk's number!

191
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,183
Akio! The bass player!

192
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:04,950
Call him!

193
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,887
I can't!
You have to!

194
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,622
My heart's pounding!

195
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,322
Let's see!

196
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,925
Hey! Don't make me touch your breasts!

197
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,326
Sorry.

198
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,796
They're just amateurs.

199
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,696
Breasts, ugh.

200
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,798
Sorry.

201
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,757
Sign them quickly
and I'll make you director!

202
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,729
Director?

203
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,307
Edokko.

204
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm Kurita of Maple Records.

205
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,784
Could you come by the shop?

206
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,366
Kanna!

207
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,905
He's a punk rocker in his prime.

208
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,397
I want you to be on your guard.

209
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,412
Don't get pushed around!

210
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,280
Don't fall for him, either.

211
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,050
And remember...!

212
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,517
One album.

213
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,747
"Edokko"

214
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,350
Excuse me!

215
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,353
I called earlier. I'm Kanna Kurita.

216
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,029
He's no hunk.

217
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,606
Akio... Akio...

218
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,180
Akio!

219
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,183
Akio, you've got a visitor.

220
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:54,783
Akio, you've got a visitor.

221
00:14:55,427 --> 00:15:00,057
Excuse me. Are you Akio's father?

222
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,296
"Akio's father? "

223
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,933
My father is bedridden.

224
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,703
Who're you? A porn queen?

225
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,753
Maple Records Talent Division.

226
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,621
I'm Director Kurita.

227
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,125
I'm here to see Akio of Brass Knuckle Kids.

228
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,526
That's me.

229
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,262
No, the bassist Akio.

230
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,096
Me, me!

231
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,365
No, not you.

232
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,702
Who answered the phone?

233
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,338
You? You can't be him.

234
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,875
You said Akio was here. So where is he?

235
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,709
Right here!

236
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,245
Quiet, you! You in a band?

237
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,112
No.

238
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,382
You're not? What about you?
I am!

239
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,644
You're kidding!

240
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,414
Hold on a second.

241
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,589
Favorite food.

242
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,791
Fried rice!

243
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,391
Gummy bears.

244
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,192
Fried rice!

245
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,090
Gummy bears.

246
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,745
Yeah, that's me.

247
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,407
Very funny. That is not you.

248
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,684
My beard?

249
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,953
No, your age.

250
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,978
How old do you think I am?

251
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,892
Look, it says "1983"!

252
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,689
It says 1983.

253
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,523
You weren't born in 1983!

254
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,133
Do I look that young?

255
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,600
Not at all.

256
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,476
What about this?

257
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,612
That's us! Our final gig!

258
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,546
"Final gig"?

259
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,049
March 23, 1983! Sendai!

260
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:02,021
What a trip! Where'd you find this?

261
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
Hold on.

262
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,560
Brass Knuckle Kids broke up in 1983?

263
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,297
Yeah, but in my heart we're still going.

264
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,267
Thank you for your time.

265
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,791
Your phone's ringing.

266
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,507
Having trouble, director?

267
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,609
Tell "hunky" this.

268
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,777
"Hunky"?

269
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,645
If he signs, we go on tour immediately!

270
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,485
We posted their clip on our site.

271
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,257
The response was incredible!

272
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,858
Boss, Nagoya's a lock!

273
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,227
We've got Nagoya! Let's do Sendai, too!

274
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,391
Wait, wait, no!
We're getting ahead of ourselves.

275
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,768
By the way, how old are you?

276
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,366
Mr. Akio!

277
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,910
How old are you again, Mr. Akio?

278
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,128
No way, no way, no way!

279
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,164
If you can't sign him, your contract's up.

280
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:24,970
Don't give me that.
This ain't a free ride. I need results!

281
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,995
But boss!

282
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,633
Sign him... or serve sushi.
Think about it.

283
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,875
We'll get back together for you,
Ms. "Major Label".

284
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,917
But I want the original members.

285
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,348
With Haruo on bass.

286
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,026
And me on guitar.

287
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,493
You play guitar?

288
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,666
Akio taught Haruo the guitar.

289
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,202
They're brothers, 2 years apart.

290
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,669
Right, Belle?

291
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,507
A

292
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,810
G

293
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,675
Jimi Hen...

294
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,086
Pinkie on 2nd string, 8th fret.

295
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,776
A

296
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,424
G

297
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,255
Jimi Hen...

298
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:23,829
Too slow!

299
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,057
Sorry.

300
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,763
Just do the left hand.

301
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,672
A

302
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,073
G

303
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,803
Jimi Hen...

304
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,678
Pinkie!

305
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,913
Pussy!

306
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,880
Sorry!

307
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,313
A

308
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,751
G

309
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,519
Jimi Hen...

310
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,453
Good.

311
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,116
A, G, Jimi Hen...

312
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,652
A, G, Jimi Hen...

313
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,293
A, G, Jimi Hen...

314
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:22,621
I let a drunk send me
to the middle of nowhere.

315
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,189
"Sakunami Residence"

316
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,781
You lost?

317
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,727
Mr. Haruo?

318
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,188
Yup. Who're you?

319
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,234
The change is overwhelming.

320
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,941
I'm sorry you came all this way.

321
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,144
That's ancient history to me.

322
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:51,750
Of course. Why leave a peaceful,
country life for a band in Tokyo?

323
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,085
Yup.

324
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,053
And there's his father?

325
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,486
Whose father?

326
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,749
Your brother says he's bedridden.

327
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,389
You saw my brother?

328
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,893
You asked him before me?

329
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,273
What's that scumbag up to?

330
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,041
Nothing. He's fine.

331
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,109
He's fine, huh?

332
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,478
No, he's drunk all day.

333
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,036
Drunk all day?

334
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:26,216
He's called the "Sid Vicious of Koenji".

335
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:34,993
Leave. I ain't playing guitar for
that stinkin' band.

336
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,086
Not guitar... bass.

337
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,864
Your brother will play guitar.
You're on the bass.

338
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,700
Scram!

339
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,316
You tell my brother this.

340
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,350
Our father's... dead.

341
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,044
Haruo! What the hell are you doing?

342
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,535
Just lowering the bridge.

343
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,683
Rad!

344
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,224
Nice move!

345
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,328
When I turn pro, he can be my roadie!

346
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,936
Buzz off!

347
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,305
What? I'm your father!

348
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,206
Beat it!

349
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,434
Screw you!

350
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,679
Roadie, huh?

351
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,093
What a relief.

352
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,531
I did what I could.

353
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:29,374
Guess I'll return to Tokyo and quit my job.

354
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,901
Then go home and work for dad.

355
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,637
Ugh, my dad.

356
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,681
Welcome.

357
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,302
"Yes! 100,000 hits
on the Brass Knuckle Kids Web site!"

358
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,817
I don't know what to do!

359
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,318
What's wrong, Sweetie?

360
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,719
Help me!

361
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:19,124
You smell.

362
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,853
Yuck!

363
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,831
I'm quitting! For sure, this time!

364
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,632
I'm quitting!

365
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,499
There, there. I know how you feel.

366
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,173
But if you give up now...

367
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:40,110
you turn your back on 100,000 fans.

368
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,912
What's the name of that band again?

369
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,512
Brass Knuckle Kids.

370
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,716
You like them, Kanna.

371
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,032
No, I don't.

372
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:05,203
Sure you do. You wouldn't cry otherwise.

373
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:09,663
Where's the tough Kanna I know?

374
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:16,214
I bet everyone in Brass Band Kids...

375
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,116
Knuckle Kids.

376
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:22,177
They know how you feel.
I'm sure they like you.

377
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,694
I'm sure they don't.

378
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,425
Yes, they do. Everyone loves you, Kanna.

379
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,324
I'm so jealous.

380
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,337
You love me, too, Masaru?

381
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,243
Of course, I do.

382
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:49,179
And I love you!

383
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,540
There, there.

384
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,242
Kanna.

385
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,479
You've got to make the most of it.

386
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:05,430
I guess I can give it another shot.

387
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,832
That's my girl!

388
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,924
Stop that.

389
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,001
Haruo has no intention of joining.

390
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,769
And it seems your father has died.

391
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:29,452
So... how about a new guitarist?

392
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,515
You spilled my drink!

393
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,257
What about a new bassist?

394
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,462
I said original members.

395
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,556
Convincing them is your job.

396
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,461
Easy, Akio. You'll make her cry.

397
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,896
Too late. Look, she's crying.

398
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:56,081
Maybe if I'd met you 25 years ago,
it'd be easier.

399
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,584
But I sense no potential in you now.

400
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,319
'Cause I'm middle-aged?
No!

401
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,088
'Cause I'm a geezer?
Exactly!

402
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,487
Thanks a lot.

403
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,628
I never had any interest in
going "major", anyway.

404
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,263
Ugly! Ugly cow.

405
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:16,996
I'm not an ugly cow. It's too late to quit!

406
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,606
Boss still believes

407
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,410
you're a new band like 20-something years old.

408
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,713
In fact, the whole country...
100,000 fans...

409
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,183
can't wait for
Brass Knuckle Kids' national tour.

410
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,118
Get more punk! Punk rock!

411
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,911
The times have finally caught up to us.

412
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,528
Caught up and passed on by, I'd say.

413
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,697
So what next?

414
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,602
You'd better meet my boss, first.

415
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,772
Maybe that'll wake him up.

416
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,976
The tour will be canceled,
the contract nullified.

417
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,478
I'll take responsibility and quit.
I'll go home...

418
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,140
Let's not meet him yet.

419
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:09,254
Book a studio. I'll get the other two,

420
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,620
but you bring Haruo.

421
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,927
And no cheap garage band studio.

422
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,996
I want the best equipment.

423
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,030
Get up!

424
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,667
Champagne in the dressing rooms.

425
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,004
1st class train car... or limos.

426
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,074
Isn't it a bit soon for a big head?

427
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,010
Not at all. We got 100,000 "heats".

428
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,947
But they all want to see you 25 years ago.

429
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,316
Not if we play better.

430
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,943
That's true but...

431
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,742
can you do it?

432
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,356
We've got to push the lie as far as it will go.

433
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,499
If we put on the show of a lifetime...

434
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,001
it will cease to be a lie...

435
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,299
and become a miracle.

436
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:07,378
But I have a strange feeling
he could be right.

437
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:13,010
Let's show them a miracle
that will erase the lie.

438
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,516
Okay.

439
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,232
Sorry but could you hurry it up?
They'll be here soon.

440
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:31,736
Maybe I could help you?

441
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,601
But they'll be here any minute.

442
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,030
Stop hissing.

443
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,044
This is all wrong.

444
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,922
What're you doing, mister? The drums!

445
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,914
Lookin' good, zipperhead!

446
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,661
Akio!
Young!

447
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,219
Great to see you!

448
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,330
That's the drummer!

449
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,594
You came prepared!

450
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,308
I left my work to my staff.

451
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,510
How old are you now?

452
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,012
"Young" Noodles

453
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,888
He's not named after those noodles.

454
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,917
He's really the youngest.

455
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,961
You die!

456
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,826
He was a glue-sniffing,

457
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,394
head-banging hood from age 13.

458
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:45,944
He joined the band at what?
17? 18?

459
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,113
I'm 42. Bad luck year.

460
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,582
Yeah, I've been there.

461
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,016
Is Haruo coming?

462
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,284
You call him?

463
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,717
Well... um... I...

464
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,721
Jimmy?

465
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,616
Jimmy?

466
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,262
Sorry we're late.

467
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,196
Pain in the butt.

468
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,305
You look so much better!

469
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,273
"Better"?

470
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,396
Jimmy?

471
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,546
You're gonna sing, right?

472
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,811
Here.

473
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:11,556
I'm sorry. He insisted on showing up.

474
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,742
Sorry, hemorrhoids.

475
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:28,576
I just had surgery. Can I stand?

476
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,616
Go ahead.

477
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,810
Thanks.

478
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,690
Jimmy?

479
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,564
Yo, Jimmy.

480
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,432
Dear?

481
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,299
Honey!

482
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,316
Miracles.

483
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,876
You have to believe in miracles, Kanna.

484
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:31,175
I'm not getting any sound here!

485
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,077
What're you drumming?

486
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,342
There's no guitar!

487
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,423
Not bad.

488
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,084
Not bad my ass!

489
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,363
That wouldn't even make it
in a high school talent show!

490
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,196
Lame! Feeble! Out of the question!

491
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,470
It's been 25 years, lady.

492
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,139
And we were never that good.

493
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,342
You can say that again!

494
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,745
100,000 fans are well aware of that!

495
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,146
Stop the video.

496
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:47,685
How can you sound worse in a
studio than on a low-res PC?

497
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,287
I said stop recording!

498
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,482
With pleasure!

499
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,995
If you can't do it, you should've said so!

500
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,396
The tour's in 2 weeks!

501
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,658
Yo.

502
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,101
Mr. Haruo!

503
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:23,588
Custom!

504
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,078
Hands off!

505
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,359
What're you doin'?

506
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,466
Shut up and play bass, swine.

507
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,831
Jimmy?

508
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,472
He's standing! Jimmy's standing!

509
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,368
He's not a cripple or anything.

510
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,307
Is that right?

511
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,255
Is this the miracle?

512
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,506
Something's still not right.

513
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,371
Maybe they just suck.

514
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,947
But he's singing.

515
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,437
And she's into it.

516
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,295
This just might work!

517
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,774
If they practice like hell,
this might be possible!

518
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,183
Take this before meals...

519
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,352
this during meals.

520
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,946
And this after meals.

521
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,688
Is that our ride?

522
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,967
Okay, hop in!

523
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:55,873
My hemorrhoids make sitting hard.

524
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,840
Get in.

525
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,101
No way.

526
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,950
I thought I said limos.

527
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,477
We spent too much on rehearsals.
Just live with it.

528
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,312
Open the window if you're gonna smoke.

529
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:21,759
This brings back memories. Right, Akio?

530
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,601
Right, Haruo?

531
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:28,061
You hear me? Open the window!

532
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,039
Taking turns driving.

533
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,037
Akio scoring with the local chicks.

534
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,616
What was that?

535
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,462
There. You happy?

536
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,165
What're you doing?

537
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,268
This is my dad's car.
You're paying for this!

538
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,133
Cow!
Pig!

539
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:05,934
"Restroom"

540
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:35,206
Jimmy formed a band with Haruo first.

541
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,541
Was it 30 years ago?

542
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,144
There were no Indie labels.

543
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,237
So they had to try the biggies.

544
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,808
And so...

545
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,584
they became teen idols.

546
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,956
"Boys A La Mode"
Rich girl with the ponytail

547
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,325
Rich girl with the ponytail

548
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:05,260
Won't you join me on a journey
through space and time

549
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,440
With travel mates Jimmy!

550
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,641
Haru!

551
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,776
Potato!

552
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,743
Cheese!

553
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,811
Murai!

554
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,715
Never mind, don't take it to heart

555
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,786
Hop on Red Riding Hood

556
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:26,424
Dorky!
We didn't have the word "dorky" back then.

557
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,858
But I thought it.

558
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,297
But they were young

559
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,857
and on television.

560
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,329
They were riding high.

561
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,273
Haru, ready for take off?

562
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,171
Okay!

563
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,000
Launch!

564
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,609
Give them room, please!

565
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,680
But Haruo wasn't happy.

566
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,825
He said it wasn't Rock...

567
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,529
embarrassed to show his brother.

568
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,232
Get in, Jimmy!

569
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,460
I'll squash you!

570
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,469
Make room for the equipment!

571
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,697
Move dammit!

572
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,787
Akio's band was struggling.

573
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,550
So he worked as a roadie.

574
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,420
Akio!

575
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,599
You friends?

576
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,999
That'll make things easy.

577
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,804
Jimmy! Jimmy!

578
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,169
I'll kill you!

579
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,670
It's a pleasure, "Mr. Haruo".

580
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,996
Nostalgic eh, Haruo?

581
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,590
You came here with that crap pop band.

582
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,503
When's the band arriving?

583
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,571
Say what?

584
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,972
They're coming by Bullet Train.
First class.

585
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,812
Okay, staff can go set up first.

586
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,643
Thanks.

587
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,786
Push the lie as far as it will go, right?

588
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,276
Uh-huh.

589
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:48,198
Easy now. Okay! No sound out of the bass amp.

590
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,859
Wait, never mind.

591
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,603
Hello? Really? Gotcha.

592
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,281
They just passed Hamamatsu.

593
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,445
That's great news!
The line outside is tremendous.

594
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,527
Oh my god.

595
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:28,034
The crowd's huge.
They've bought up all the merchandise!

596
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,201
Don't get so excited.

597
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,547
I'm not but... is that hair dye?

598
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,917
Nagoya's delinquents are all out there!

599
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,318
Nose rings and all!

600
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,653
Kanna?

601
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,491
What're you doing?

602
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,659
Coming to greet the band.

603
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,727
You can't.

604
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,861
Why not?

605
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,351
Because...

606
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,127
it's dangerous.

607
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:03,407
They're real edgy right now psyching up.

608
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,075
Their nerves are like razors.

609
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,238
In fact, they have razors.

610
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,876
Where are the band members?

611
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,586
They're slashing themselves for motivation.

612
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:20,546
If you go in there... you could get hurt.

613
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:25,620
Wow, I can't wait. Okay,
I'll be in the audience.

614
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,196
This place will be wild tonight.

615
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,728
Know why we're starting the tour in Nagoya?

616
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,193
It's the home of Japanese Punk.

617
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:42,473
"Star Club", "Genbaku Onanies" and...

618
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,476
Yes!

619
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,139
It's Saturday night! Ready to go crazy!

620
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:56,417
From Tokyo! Brass Knuckle Kids!

621
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:04,895
Brass Knuckle Kids!

622
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,021
Boss!

623
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,702
Thanks for everything!

624
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,036
What?

625
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,162
Nothing.

626
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,625
A warm-up band?

627
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,640
What is that?

628
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,153
Evenin'!

629
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:40,556
With 100,000 Internet "heats"...
we're Brass Knuckle Kids.

630
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,616
Ow!

631
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,120
They're not kids!

632
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,033
Thanks for waiting.

633
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,466
Screw you!

634
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,070
Brass Knuckle Geezers!

635
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,300
Kanna!

636
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,322
Shut up!

637
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,560
Shut the hell up!

638
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,858
You're about to witness a miracle.

639
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,310
Jimmy! Jimmy!

640
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,257
Jimmy!...

641
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,460
Exterminate the human race!
Brass Knuckle Kids!

642
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,984
1 2 3 4

643
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,596
Sorry!

644
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,622
Haruo! Play, Haruo!

645
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,193
What're you doing?

646
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,742
Miss? Miss?

647
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,743
Miss!

648
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:21,518
Your cell phone's been ringing non-stop.

649
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,008
Sorry.

650
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,544
What a nuisance, huh?

651
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,016
I'm as drunk as Akio.

652
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:30,954
Hello?

653
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:37,797
I am so sorry, Boss.

654
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,926
I'm the one who should apologize.

655
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,137
Boss!

656
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,671
Tonight, I saw true Punk Rock.

657
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:56,951
Punk is a way of life! Right, master?

658
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:02,388
So the tour is still on?

659
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,358
What do you think?

660
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,865
1st class seats.

661
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:18,573
I never dreamed you'd show me real Punk.

662
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,640
Boss!

663
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:27,640
I'm sorry... he wasn't hunky.

664
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,284
Miss? Miss?

665
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,395
Miss!

666
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,858
Miss!

667
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,334
Your phone's been ringing non-stop.

668
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,509
Stop it.

669
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,445
Move your hands!

670
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,411
Come on... Akio!

671
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,686
Not the hair!

672
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,859
Knock it off!

673
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,535
Did I come all this way to nurse a drunk?

674
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,439
Truth is that footage was from
a concert 25 years ago...

675
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,599
Now you tell me!

676
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,203
I'll pay for repairs, and then it's over.

677
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,415
So the tour is canceled?

678
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,077
Absolutely not. There are cancel fees.

679
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,156
Once the tour's over,

680
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,919
you and the band are through.

681
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:45,256
It's guys like you who killed Punk Rock.

682
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,200
Did you say something?

683
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,370
That's enough, please.

684
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,530
Think about it!

685
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,575
Why's an old show getting 100,000 "heats"?

686
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,144
"Hits"! The word is "hits"!

687
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:05,171
It's 'cause today's bands suck!

688
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,980
Say that after you can put on a show.

689
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,416
Forget the past.

690
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,187
What about now? Huh?

691
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,757
Did you play one song right?

692
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,499
Did you please one customer?

693
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,695
Face it.

694
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,936
You're a has-been.

695
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,713
What now?

696
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:51,061
Continue the tour?

697
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,529
Or shall we go back to Tokyo?

698
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,570
I don't care either way.

699
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,765
What do you mean??

700
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,575
I'm not like them.

701
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,410
I had money and a life.

702
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,678
Shut your trap.

703
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,380
I came 'cause you asked me to.

704
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,340
Lose your job or not,

705
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,681
I'll follow you

706
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,027
What about you?

707
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:30,734
I don't know. Akio?

708
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,235
What do we do??

709
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,930
I don't know.

710
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,734
Jimmy?

711
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,821
Of course, the band would never last.

712
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,881
Too fake.

713
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:03,156
They were an ugly band, too.
Wouldn't sell.

714
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,434
That's when Punk arrived in Japan.

715
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,106
I thought here's a fun wave to ride.

716
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,976
Ready, Haru?

717
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:25,922
No, wait!

718
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,624
Launch!

719
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:28,886
You call that music?

720
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,696
Your turn.

721
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,398
I incited Young to start a riot.

722
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,730
But I didn't tell the band.

723
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:47,577
And played dumb.

724
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,238
Take it easy.

725
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,771
And then Young...

726
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,348
hit me with brass knuckles.

727
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,599
Now this is getting fun.

728
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,976
I hate violence!

729
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,287
Play something.

730
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,491
Don't worry. No one's watching you anyway.

731
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,514
Listen up, assholes!

732
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:36,451
Today, your favorite crappy band
is no more!

733
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:31,535
Brass Knuckle Kids were born.
It was 1981, I think.

734
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,581
"Brass Knuckle Kids"

735
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,135
Pew!

736
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,671
Who farted? Akio?

737
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,070
Wasn't me.

738
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,179
You fart?

739
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,748
Did you?

740
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,775
You? Did you just fart?

741
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,022
Who cares who did it?

742
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,490
Unbelievable!

743
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,737
Mr. Akio!

744
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,139
That one wasn't me!

745
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,574
"That one"?

746
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,543
Quit stopping the car over a fart!

747
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,813
Well, quit farting! It's gross!

748
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:48,751
It smells 5 times worse than you all think!

749
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:53,156
For every fart,
you'll be penalized 500 yen.

750
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,147
Got it?

751
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,935
P.U.

752
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,638
Here's my fine, then.

753
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,970
From the next one!

754
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,746
So you'll be quitting for sure this time?

755
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,321
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

756
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,225
No, it isn't.

757
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,760
Fried rice.
Chao Fan.

758
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,819
Jumbo dumplings.

759
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,124
Did you hear my new song?

760
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,567
Yeah, I did. It was soothing.

761
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,367
Thanks.

762
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,339
Say, after the tour...
can I meet your father?

763
01:00:55,351 --> 01:01:01,620
I've been thinking about our future.

764
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,926
I'll keep writing songs...

765
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:07,196
but I don't want to pin everything

766
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,931
on a career that might not happen.

767
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,559
Akio!
Okay, okay!

768
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,839
I'll ask you one more time.

769
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,375
What did I order?

770
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,010
Fried rice.

771
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,612
And what's this?

772
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,746
Chao Fan.

773
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,314
And this?

774
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,416
Fried rice.

775
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:32,388
Fried rice?
You're saying this is fried rice?
