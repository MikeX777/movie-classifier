1
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,878
- Gymnastics.
- Keep up the good work.

2
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,380
- Sue Allen Baines.

3
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,926
- We're all very, very proud.
- And Nancy Wilson.

4
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,302
In Track and Field --
- I hope you do

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,180
as well in the Nationals.
- Joe Ward.

6
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,475
In Gymnastics, Frank Agee.
- All the hard work

7
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,394
has paid off now, Frank.

8
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,189
- Track and Field, Phillip Dandridge.

9
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,232
- I'm very impressed

10
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,651
with your time.
- Swimming,

11
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,111
Lynn Fox.
- You had it

12
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,781
all going for you today.
- And in gymnastics,

13
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,616
- Excellent.
- Annie Rivers.

14
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,410
- Your dad is gonna be very proud of you.

15
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,663
- The Falcon Academy of Athletics

16
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,207
is proud of these young athletes

17
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,669
who will represent us at
the Nationals competitions.

18
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,053
- Excuse me.

19
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:22,888
- Excuse me.

20
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:23,722
We have a little problem.

21
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,556
- What's that?

22
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,891
- They forgot to pack the napkins.

23
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:26,725
- Damn people.

24
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,143
- It doesn't look like
you need 'em anyway.

25
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,144
- What, do you want
'em to wipe their hands

26
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:29,978
on the tablecloth?

27
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:30,979
- Well, I can go to the bathroom
and get some toilet paper.

28
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,314
- Well, do something.

29
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,648
- No napkins?

30
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,483
- Yes.
- No problem,

31
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,317
I'll be right back.

32
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,443
- Thank you.

33
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,405
- Let's sit down, everybody.

34
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,710
- Take this end right here.

35
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,505
Everybody, just grab a piece right here.

36
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,464
There you go.

37
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,673
There you go.

38
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,634
Take one, Joe.

39
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,638
Smiling.

40
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,472
- What is it, plastic?

41
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,306
- Move your hands.

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,808
This should just about do it.

43
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,269
- Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

44
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,272
Before introducing Mr.
Sam Burger from Tiger,

45
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,943
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank him publicly

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,280
for the continued support of our school,

47
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,909
and his invaluable
advice and financial aid.

48
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,956
Now, may I introduce Mr.
Sam Burger, my friend.

49
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:31,790
- Thank you.

50
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:35,794
Thank you.

51
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,007
I'm proud to be here again this year.

52
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,095
As a representative of Tiger, I'm honored

53
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,639
to support the great
work that you're doing,

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,351
both with your school and for our country.

55
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,692
I have always believed in
supporting the aspirations

56
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,735
of this country's great athletes.

57
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,908
In a democracy like ours,

58
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,204
we know that financial
support for athletics

59
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,165
must come from private institutions,

60
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,879
not government subsidies, like
that of totalitarian regimes.

61
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,009
But most of all, we seek to foster

62
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,555
the camaraderie and brotherhood
that athletics produce

63
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,806
among young men and women.

64
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,728
Athletics is universal.

65
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,899
It goes beyond politics,
race and national boundaries.

66
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,736
It celebrates the brotherhood of man,

67
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,448
the unity of purpose to
strive to the utmost,

68
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,162
to achieve the absolute
potential for development.

69
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,377
As superior human beings...

70
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,354
- Are you sure you haven't
seen my gym shorts and t-shirt?

71
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,064
- Yeah, I'm sure.

72
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:22,984
- You know what?

73
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:23,818
- What?

74
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,821
- You forgot to say
goodnight to me last night.

75
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:27,781
- Is that so?

76
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,699
- Yeah, that's so.

77
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,868
- Well, I must've been tired.

78
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,874
- How can I lose something
in a place this small?

79
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,169
- You know what else you forgot?

80
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,380
- What?

81
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,299
- To say you love me.

82
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,512
- Well, I'll make sure
not to forget tonight.

83
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,889
I know they're in here because
I saw 'em here last night.

84
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,933
- Maybe you're wearing it.

85
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,142
- Sure I am.

86
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,398
- Did you look in the
refrigerator under the cheese?

87
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,818
- That's not --

88
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,237
Give me my things, come on!

89
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,031
- No.
- No, give me my things.

90
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,951
- How could you forget
to say goodnight to me?

91
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,995
- Give me my shorts.
- Nevermind.

92
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,455
- The one I'm after is this.

93
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,333
Look what I got here, huh?
- No.

94
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,794
Now stop it.
- Come here.

95
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,547
- What?

96
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,134
- You say goodnight and I love you.

97
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,845
- Goodnight and I love you.

98
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,646
- How'd it go yesterday?

99
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,356
- It went pretty rough.

100
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,026
Drew's still on my case.

101
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:46,943
- Why?

102
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,653
You won, didn't you?

103
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,487
- Exactly.

104
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,489
But you know how thick she and Shelly are.

105
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,991
Besides, that's not
what really worries me.

106
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,075
- What?

107
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,536
- It's what's her name down in Florida.

108
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,080
You know she's a full
second fitter than I am.

109
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,916
She's the one I have to
beat to win the Nationals.

110
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,876
- Don't worry about it, babe.

111
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,044
You'll do it.

112
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,630
Now, have Diane give you that
new stuff they've gotten now.

113
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,133
It's helped me out a lot.

114
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,093
- Frank, you know my worries

115
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,054
about all this medication
they've been giving us.

116
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,431
You know, it really could be dangerous.

117
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,601
- Babe, everybody's doing it.

118
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,603
You don't see 'em dropping
dead, do you? Hmm?

119
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,650
- These competitions
are an ongoing process.

120
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,693
To qualify for the Olympics,

121
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,278
you're gonna have to win them all.

122
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,490
Now, you've worked hard, but
you've gotta work harder.

123
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,825
In the Nationals, winners
from all over the country

124
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,535
are gonna be competing against you.

125
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,788
That means you have to work twice as hard.

126
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,251
I'm gonna let you in on my
special secret for success.

127
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,464
Starting today, I'm gonna
add an additional two hours

128
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,465
to your work schedules.

129
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,424
- Oh, come on.

130
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,013
- Let's go to work.

131
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,352
- Some secret to success.

132
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,688
He never made it to the Olympics.

133
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,783
- That's good, Lynn. 53:37.

134
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:17,992
Take three seconds off that,

135
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,619
you'll break the world's record.

136
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,580
Okay, come on, outta the pool.
Let's practice some dives.

137
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,708
Okay.

138
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,544
Grab the side of the pool, Shelly.

139
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,504
Julie, I want you to set this one out.

140
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,964
Just watch Shelly and Lynn.

141
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,340
You girls ready?

142
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,925
Get set.

143
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:34,759
Go.

144
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,267
All right, come on, come
on. Let's do it again.

145
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,106
Come on up, let's do it again.

146
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,482
We're training for the Olympics.

147
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,317
Come on, this is no joke.

148
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,528
Gotta get your acts together, you girls.

149
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,071
All right, grip the edge of the pool,

150
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,197
a little more with your toes.

151
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,075
Good, keep your feet shoulder width apart.

152
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,202
Lynn, come on, hit the water flatter.

153
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,413
Keep your head down,
straighter line with your body.

154
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,914
All right? Come on, grab
the side of the pool.

155
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,542
Now, let's concentrate you guys.

156
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,668
Ready?

157
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,128
Set.

158
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:10,962
Go.

159
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,677
- Let me have your chart, please.

160
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,511
No, very good.

161
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,512
Your pulse rate is 55.

162
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,346
That's excellent.

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,306
Sit down.

164
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,019
Look, I'm quite pleased.

165
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,771
I think the steroids that
I had Diane put you on

166
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,398
are paying off.

167
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,232
- I feel great.

168
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,067
- Ah, good, good.

169
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,570
Well, your heart, your vital
organs are very strong.

170
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,404
- Okay.
- Keep up

171
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,697
the good work, Frank.

172
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,823
- Thanks.

173
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,715
- Joe, last Saturday, you
missed your morning examination.

174
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,634
- Yeah, I had something important to do.

175
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,303
- Listen to me, okay? Continuity

176
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,347
Is a very important part
of this whole program,

177
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,640
so don't do it again.

178
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,851
- Okay.

179
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:07,685
- All right.

180
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,313
Diane, has he had his morning vitamins?

181
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,314
- Yes, Doctor.

182
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,817
- All right, just start
him on the new shots.

183
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,628
- Damn it, Joe. Forget the
accuracy, gimme the muscle.

184
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,255
Here, do it again.

185
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,519
What are you, a ballet dancer?

186
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,938
Keep that up, I'm gonna
have to get you a tutu.

187
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,149
Now, come on, put every
ounce of strength behind it.

188
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,193
See if we can do better this time.

189
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,964
- Not bad, huh, Coach?

190
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,049
- It's gotta be a hell of
a lot better than that.

191
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,676
- What the hell do you want?

192
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,886
That was a damn good throw.

193
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,930
If you think I'm shit, why
don't you just tell me?

194
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,182
- I'll tell you what I think, Joe.

195
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,936
I think you're damn good.

196
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,896
But don't let it go to your head.

197
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,376
- All right, just don't mess
around with the kid, okay?

198
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,422
- Wow.

199
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,256
- Whoa.
- Hey.

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,966
You guys seen Sue Allen today?

201
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,967
She's hot.

202
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,218
- Yeah, I saw her out there.

203
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,096
- Say, I had it all working,
I've got to admit it.

204
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,182
- It's a good thing you can't swim,

205
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,850
or I'd be in a lot of trouble.

206
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,440
- Hey, congratulations, that
was really good work today.

207
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,399
- Thanks.

208
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,069
- Hi.

209
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:21,986
- Hey.

210
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,237
- How's it going?

211
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,531
- It's going terrific.

212
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,241
- What are you gonna do tonight?

213
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,743
- Well, I'm gonna go
back and visit the gym

214
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,620
and work out for a while.

215
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,662
- Work out?

216
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,873
You just qualified for the Nationals.

217
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,291
- Qualified.

218
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,086
Winning there is gonna be
a hell of a lot tougher

219
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,712
and nothing's gonna stop me.

220
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,299
- Well, we're all going out to celebrate.

221
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,676
- Hey, have a good time. Really.

222
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,303
Have one on me.

223
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,389
- See ya.

224
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:51,891
- Hey, it's great Lynn and Annie

225
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,976
are going to the Nationals with us.

226
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,603
- Together, we'll go to the Olympics.

227
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,021
- You think so?

228
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,564
- Well, I know I'm going.

229
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,732
I'd like you to be there.

230
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,442
- Hey, I'm making the trip.

231
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,489
Hey, Joe, think you'll
make it to the Olympics?

232
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,990
Wanna see my gold medal?

233
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,455
- Yeah.

234
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,915
- Hey Joe. Listen, we're
gonna go out to the restaurant

235
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,042
and have a couple beers,
you wanna join us, huh?

236
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,210
- No, thanks.

237
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,004
- Hey.

239
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,505
- Hey, hey.

240
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,090
- Oh, where's Nancy?

241
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,009
- Oh, she stayed to work out
with the weights for a while.

242
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,803
- Oh, boy, I'd like to lift
a couple of her weights.

243
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,972
- There's enough dumbbells
up there without you.

244
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,099
- Come on, let's go.

245
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,017
- Let's get outta here.

246
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,851
- Hey, wouldn't it be great

247
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,561
if the seven of us made
the Olympics together?

248
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,897
- Yeah, and I'll make sure
you stay away from Nancy

249
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,772
and her weights.

250
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,192
- Hey, I was just kidding about Nancy.

251
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,279
- Oh, aren't you gonna
open the door for me?

252
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,906
That's real sweet.

253
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,408
Nevermind now.

254
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,039
- You seen Nancy?

255
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,876
Can't you stop bobbing up and down

256
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,503
and listen to me for a second?

257
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,214
- No, I haven't seen Nancy.

258
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,590
How'd you like to come
over to my house tonight,

259
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,175
bob up and down on my bed?

260
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,593
- Don't you wish?

261
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,761
- Yes, I do.

262
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,430
- See you later.

263
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,932
- If you luck out.

264
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,687
- I really don't know
what you see in Phil.

265
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,438
You know, he's really an airhead.

266
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,984
- Oh, I'll bring him down to earth.

267
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,944
Well, I gotta go, I'm late for my checkup.

268
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,195
I'll see you later, Poopy.

269
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,155
- All right, see you later kid.

270
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,032
- What are you talking about?

271
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,201
- I think we've gotta go back
to the previous dosage level,

272
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,078
we've gotta go a little bit slower.

273
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,206
- We can't let these
incidents stop our work.

274
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,417
What we're doing is too important.

275
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,502
Sure, there are risks involved,

276
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,837
but need I remind you

277
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,090
that what we are trying to do
is to maximize to the utmost

278
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,175
the athletic potential of the human body.

279
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
- Dr. Jordine, they are
kids, they are kids!

280
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,804
They are not Guinea pigs.

281
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,306
- But the East Germans and the Russians

282
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,682
are doing the same thing.

283
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,184
It's only in this country
that we've neglected

284
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,770
the scientific possibilities
of the human body.

285
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,647
And they're winning all the gold medals.

286
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,025
- I think you're being very unreasonable.

287
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,569
- Diane, this is my life's work

288
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,946
and I will let no one stop me.

289
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,824
- Well, I hope you're gonna
take full responsibility,

290
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:37,658
because I'm not gonna

291
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,952
take responsibility.
- I already have.

292
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,495
Now, you can go back to work.

293
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,250
- Okay, you're the boss.

294
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,850
- So Joe, I heard you tried to

295
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,478
lay Nancy again last night, huh?

296
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,437
- Beat it.

297
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,273
- You watch with that thing, man.

298
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,151
Those things are dangerous.

299
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,283
- Does anybody know where Nancy is?

300
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,951
- No.
- Uh-uh.

301
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,588
- You know, Annie, Dr. Jordine
thinks very highly of you

302
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,299
and he has instructed me to start you

303
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,803
on retardation injections.

304
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,055
He's afraid that your bust line

305
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,224
has being developing too rapidly.

306
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,602
- You've gotta be kidding.

307
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,020
- Doctor's orders.

308
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,357
- What kind of stuff is it?

309
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,483
- Hormones.

310
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,111
- Isn't that pretty radical?

311
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,779
- No, not really.

312
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,615
These Europeans have
been doing it for years.

313
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,452
- Oh, that's it right there.

314
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,496
- Right, you have a
bit of a muscle strain here.

315
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,124
- Oh, that feels so good.

316
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,044
- Now, just relax, okay?

317
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,422
- Oh, it'll be a pleasure.

318
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,339
- Good.

319
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,470
- I'm glad you're one
of the seven winners.

320
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,766
I knew you had it in you.

321
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,197
- Diane, I think I better go.

322
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,991
- Huh, sure.

323
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,459
- Good girls.

324
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,376
Okay, let's call it a day.

325
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,335
All right?

326
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,590
- I'm headed straight for the sauna.

327
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,133
You coming along, Shelly?

328
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,926
- No, I don't wanna.

329
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,387
- See you later, Shelly.

330
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,305
- Bye.

331
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,765
- Guys take care.

332
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,443
- I feel great.

333
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,402
- I wish I did.

334
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,490
- My turns really suck today.

335
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,159
I think I'm having a problem
with my depth perception.

336
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,368
- Don't worry.

337
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,454
You got another two months to work on it.

338
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,914
And lemme tell you,

339
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,041
this is the first time in my life

340
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,210
I feel I have my act together.

341
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,712
- Oh, are you going to
Annie's surprise party?

342
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,339
- I forgot all about it.

343
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
I'm going to San Francisco.

344
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,092
- Sue!

345
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,262
- But I have to go up to
my boyfriend's graduation.

346
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,098
We also planned a little party of our own.

347
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,975
- Oh.

348
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,520
- Please explain to Annie.

349
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,896
- Well, we'll miss you.

350
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,606
See you later.

351
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,149
You have a good time, okay?

352
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,442
- Thanks.

353
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,194
See you.
- Bye-bye.

354
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,457
- I just don't understand this.

355
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,125
The whole day's gone by.

356
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,503
Hasn't anybody heard from Nancy Wilson?

357
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,421
- No, not a thing.

358
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,382
- Call her parents' phone.

359
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,341
- Okay.

360
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,218
- I don't like this.

361
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,052
- Weren't you supposed to

362
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,012
drive her home last night, Belinda?

363
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,681
- No, I wasn't.

364
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:29,974
But how about you, Jack?

365
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,059
Weren't you taking her home?

366
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,394
- No, I did not.
- Come on, guys.

367
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,562
Let's cut it out, huh?

368
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,896
It's a little too late for that.

369
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,730
Goodnight.

370
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,190
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

371
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,276
- Aren't you gonna turn the car off?

372
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,946
- If turn it off, it's
not gonna start up again.

373
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,447
- It's so loud.

374
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,115
Gotta get a new muffler.

375
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,125
- Hey.

376
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,628
- Hey.

377
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,922
- Don't tell me you guys
came back to work out again.

378
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,256
That's what I call masochism.

379
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,510
- No, no, Annie forgot her textbooks.

380
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,201
- God, you're studying again tonight?

381
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,035
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,954
- Don't you ever get tired?

383
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,164
- If I don't hit the
books, my ass is grass.

384
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,374
- Your parents are giving you a hard time?

385
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,584
- You must say something.

386
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,796
- That's what's I'm talking about.

387
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,298
- I'll tell you, her dad's
been giving me a bunch of --

388
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,133
bunch of hassle.

389
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,718
- Been acting like what?

390
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,470
- Didn't approve of the
relationship, or something?

391
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,765
- Doesn't approve of, huh.

392
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,667
- They've locked the doors already.

393
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,878
I've gotta get my books.

394
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,796
- Okay, let's try the windows.

395
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,673
Weren't you supposed to
pick up Nancy this morning?

396
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,508
- Yeah, but she never showed up.

397
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,260
- Oh, Coach Webber
should know where she is.

398
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,344
He keeps all the schedules.

399
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,222
- I asked him, but he said
he didn't know anything.

400
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,390
- That's strange.

401
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,086
- Hey, aren't you coming in with me?

402
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,046
- Ballgame's on the radio.

403
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,714
I'll be in the car.

404
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,269
- Of course
I'll call you, Sergeant,

405
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,354
if we hear anything from her.

406
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,647
Yes, goodbye.

407
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,357
- Thank you very much, Doctor.

408
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,197
- What about this missing
girl, Nancy Wilson?

409
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,073
- Parents called me again.

410
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,992
This time, they filed a
missing persons report

411
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,202
with the police.

412
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,579
- By the way, Sue Allen didn't show up

413
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,164
for practice this morning either.

414
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,916
- What is this, a prank?

415
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,417
- Oh, well, don't worry about Sue Allen,

416
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,960
one of the kids told me
she went to San Francisco

417
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,587
for a boyfriend's graduation.

418
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,716
- We can't have these kids
going off anytime they want to.

419
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,551
Now, it's up to all of you to make sure

420
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,220
that this doesn't happen again.

421
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,181
- Well, here are the files.

422
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,779
- Okay, Annie, but
concentrate on your dismount.

423
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,280
- I will.

424
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,074
Can I speak to your moment, Coach?

425
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,784
- Sure what is it?

426
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,619
- It's my folks.

427
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,037
My grades have gone down around school

428
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,956
and my dad wants to pull me outta here.

429
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,165
- You want me to speak to him?

430
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:10,999
- Would you please?

431
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,418
- Sure, tell him to come
any time after practice.

432
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,170
- Thanks a lot, Coach.

433
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,006
Oh, by the way, have you
seen Nancy Wilson today?

434
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,466
- No, I haven't.

435
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,350
- Okay, Phil, there you go.

436
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,393
- Good job.

437
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,519
- Good luck.

438
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,565
- Will the
runners for the next event

439
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,026
take their designated lanes, please?

440
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,367
Runners, on your marks.

441
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,545
Get set.

442
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,696
- You can do it, you can do it.

443
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,916
Phil, Phil, you did it!
I'm so proud of you.

444
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,379
- I did it, I did it!

445
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,673
I'm going to the Nationals!

446
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,552
- Let's not keep Coach Webber waiting.

447
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,512
I'm sure he'd probably like to go home.

448
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,765
- Daddy, please try to understand.

449
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,642
- I understand all right.

450
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,603
I understand your grades
have fallen terribly

451
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,813
since I let you join this academy.

452
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,899
- But I can do both.

453
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,527
- You said that last
semester and you didn't.

454
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,530
- I will from now on,
I promise. You'll see.

455
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,408
- You can't take that chance.

456
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,118
We're talking about your future.

457
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,330
- And what about my future as a gymnast?

458
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,249
- How long will that last?

459
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,834
Til you're 25, maybe?

460
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,045
And then what'll you do?

461
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,671
What do all these athletes do?

462
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,802
- Daddy, I don't know about the future,

463
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,723
but I know I'm a good
gymnast. A damn good one.

464
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:32,891
And if I've got this talent,

465
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,769
I should be allowed to
make the most of it.

466
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,354
Don't take that away from me.

467
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,731
Don't make me give it up.

468
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,818
I have to do it, Daddy.

469
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,952
- This new schedule is really grueling.

470
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,122
- What's the matter, is it
cutting into your TV time?

471
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,832
- I don't have TV time.

472
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,876
I don't even have much
time for Phil anymore.

473
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,754
- What's going on now
with you and your parents?

474
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,215
- My dad and I sort of
reached an agreement.

475
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,426
- That you get straight A's

476
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,344
and break three world records, right?

477
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,012
- Yeah, something like that.

478
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,265
- Well, all my parents care
about is that when I dive in,

479
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,933
I don't do a belly flop.

480
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,324
- Lynn!

481
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,912
Lynn, I've been waiting
for you in the car.

482
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,038
Let's go.

483
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,289
God, why do you stay so late?

484
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:20,373
- How did you get in?

485
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,876
I locked all those doors.

486
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,835
- The door was open.

487
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,086
Let's go.

488
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,172
- But I locked those doors.

489
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,673
Anyway, I don't wanna leave.

490
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,760
I have to compete tomorrow and
I wanna practice some more.

491
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,014
- This ain't too bad for the 400.

492
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,891
- I was doing the hundred, you jerk.

493
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,809
- Oh, oh.

494
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,853
Hey, listen, even if
you don't win a medal,

495
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,188
I'll still love you.

496
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,941
And I'll even let you
hold on to mine, okay?

497
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,401
- Oh, are you talking about
your consolation prize,

498
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,528
or your pecker?

499
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:54,616
- Okay, okay, I'll race you. One lap.

500
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,034
- Okay, you're on.

501
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,077
- Let's go.

502
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,206
- Come on.
- Let's go.

503
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,012
I'm up.

504
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,138
The winner and new world champion.

505
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,015
Thank you, I love you all.

506
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,434
Thank you.
- That's not fair.

507
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,144
You distracted me and you
weren't wearing your suit.

508
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,145
- Wanna do something about it?

509
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,772
- Yeah.
- Come on!

510
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,695
Try that again, one more time.

511
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,988
One more time.

512
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,159
I'm sorry about that.

513
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,747
- Swimmers up.

514
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,211
On your marks.

515
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,952
- You won, you won!

516
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,456
All right.

517
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,290
- I won.

518
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,375
To the Nationals!

519
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,488
- Where have you been for the last hour?

520
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,781
- I've been out jogging.

521
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,409
- I wish you'd spend as much time with me

522
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,327
as you do with your jogging.

523
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,539
- Shelly.

524
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,457
Come on, what do you want me to say?

525
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,543
- You're supposed to be

526
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,962
one of the best swimming
coaches in the country

527
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,506
and I still didn't win.

528
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,259
Why the hell didn't I?

529
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,723
- I wanted you to win as
badly as you did, sweetheart.

530
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,725
I swear to you.

531
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,685
You still have enough time.

532
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,603
You still have a chance.

533
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,605
- Yeah, if Lynn drops dead.

534
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,565
- Oh, Shelly.

535
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,526
- This was for the Nationals, remember?

536
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,653
And you were supposed to get me in them.

537
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,658
- Shelly, I'm so sorry, darling.

538
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,243
Don't worry.

539
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,537
You're just gonna have to trust me now.

540
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,540
I'll figure something out.

541
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,042
Something will happen, you'll see.

542
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,964
Things...they just didn't
turn out the way I intended.

543
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,632
- Frank, Frank.

544
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,884
- What's the matter, Phil?

545
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,053
- Sue Allen's parents
called my folks last night.

546
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,847
They got the police out looking for her.

547
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,766
And the coaches know all about it.

548
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,725
They haven't said a word to us.

549
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,393
You find that a little strange?

550
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,772
- Why would the coaches keep it a secret?

551
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,398
- That's what's got me worried.

552
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:02,030
- First Nancy Wilson, then Sue
Allen Baines, now Joe Ward.

553
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,074
This morning, the police came

554
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,409
and I couldn't tell them a thing.

555
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,077
Now, what the hell's going on here?

556
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,663
- Well, I spoke to Sue Allen's
boyfriend in San Francisco.

557
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,165
She never showed up for his graduation

558
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,792
as she was supposed to.

559
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,252
And Joe Ward seems to have
disappeared without a trace.

560
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,129
Frankly, I'm baffled.

561
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,088
- It's unbelievable.

562
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,300
Three of our seven medal
winners have completely vanished

563
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,345
and we don't have the
faintest idea where they are.

564
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,766
- Well, I think this happened
once before in the Olympics.

565
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,476
- Maybe they had an adverse reaction

566
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,644
to some of the medication?

567
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,187
- Nonsense.

568
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,231
I mean, you as the coaching staff

569
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,233
have the responsibility
of watching these kids

570
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,026
and frankly, I'm not gonna mince words,
y

571
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,320
if you can't do it,
look for work elsewhere.

572
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,161
- Ride it up higher.

573
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,080
Don't straddle to soon.

574
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,750
- I can't straddle any later than that.

575
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:56,584
- You gotta try it.

576
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,419
You gotta be freer, too.

577
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,254
Now, practice your dismount.

578
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,590
You do your dismount, do
it at least 25 times a day.

579
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,758
- Then can I call it quits?

580
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,552
- Yeah, after the 25.

581
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,390
- Cops keep harassing me,
as if I had something to do

582
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,141
with making these kids take off.

583
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,855
Hell, as far as I'm concerned,
they can all disappear.

584
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,275
Bartender, another beer.

585
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,652
Jesus, Diane. Ten years ago,

586
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,113
I could drink a whole case
of this and not be phased.

587
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,740
Now, a couple of bottles and I'm bombed.

588
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,493
- None of us are getting any younger.

589
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,329
- Yeah.

590
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,957
Here's to sawdust in your eye.

591
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,878
I know you've had your
share of troubles, too.

592
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,380
Back in '64, do you know how close I came

593
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,257
to going to the Olympics?

594
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,300
This close.

595
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:46,968
Damn it.

596
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,014
On my last throw, I just missed it.

597
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,392
- I know, I know Jack.

598
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,562
But you're a great coach now.

599
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,773
Sometimes, helping other
people brings its own rewards.

600
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:01,608
- Rewards?

601
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,734
Shit.

602
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,487
Diane, in sports, winning is
the only thing that matters.

603
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,990
These damn kids don't
train the way we used to.

604
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,619
Busted our asses, we did, every
minute of every goddamn day.

605
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,455
No drugs to help us either.

606
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,543
"Oh, Coach Webber, I
don't feel well today."

607
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,086
Makes me sick.

608
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,007
- Why, Jack? Are you envious?

609
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,800
- No, of course not.

610
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,888
- So why don't we go to my place tonight

611
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,473
so we can finally make it?

612
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,224
- Make it?

613
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,851
Are you out of your gourd?

614
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:37,894
- Well, why don't you come over

615
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,271
SO we can at least make out a little?

616
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,483
- What is it, is there a full
moon tonight or something?

617
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,860
- Okay, you don't like
the idea of my place?

618
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,280
We'll go to a motel and see what's on TV.

619
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,241
- The only thing on tonight, Phil, is you.

620
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,287
- Can we at least go out and get a burger?

621
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,208
- Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

622
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,279
- Phil, how could you?

623
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,114
- I got you.

624
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,324
- Happy birthday.

625
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,222
- A toast.

626
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,390
- A toast.
- A toast.

627
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:58,307
- A toast.

628
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,438
- Dear Annie, as a birthday present,

629
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:08,234
Coach Webber has asked me to tell you

630
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:12,030
that he's extending your daily
workouts to 24 hours a day.

631
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,994
We're not gonna let him
get away with that, are we?

632
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:18,995
- No.
- No.

633
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,455
- We're not.
- So,

634
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,998
what are we gonna do?

635
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,917
- We're gonna get drunk.

636
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,586
- What are we gonna do?

637
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,838
- We're gonna get stoned.

638
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,300
- What are we gonna do?

639
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,219
- We're gonna get laid.

640
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,308
- Oh.

641
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,440
- You guys have a good time?

642
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,192
- Yeah.
- Hey.

643
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,526
- Thank you.
- Bye.

644
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

645
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,862
- Bye.

646
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,405
- Oh, thanks.

647
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,239
- Goodnight.

648
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,199
Bye, guys.

649
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,494
- Oh, say, Annie, are you
going over to Phil's tonight

650
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,289
to do some acrobatics on his uneven bar?

651
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,123
- Frank,

652
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,000
you're gross.
- Frank.

653
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,676
- Damn it.

654
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:16,636
- What is it?

655
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,223
- I forgot your birthday present.

656
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,350
- Where'd you forget it?

657
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,894
- It's at my place.

658
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,104
Left it on the bureau.

659
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,355
- Oh, really?

660
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,439
- Yeah.

661
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,109
- Why don't we go there?

662
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,944
- You want to go to my place?

663
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,570
- Yeah.

664
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,115
Let's go to your place.

665
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,200
- We're going to my place?

666
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,870
Oh, yes, we are going to my place.

667
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,997
- Put me down, you pinhead.

668
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,584
Sorry, it's her birthday

669
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,379
and we're going to my place, you know?

670
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,842
- Haven't you had enough?

671
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,635
- Uh-uh.

672
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
- How many is that?

673
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,766
- 97, 98, 99.

674
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,434
A hundred.

675
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,370
- Why don't you move in with me?

676
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,915
- Phil, you're out of your mind.

677
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,334
My dad would kill us.

678
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,878
You don't know him.

679
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,923
- That's just an excuse, you know it.

680
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,509
You don't wanna move in with me, do you?

681
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:39,343
- Phil, stop it.

682
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,303
- What?

683
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,474
- I just don't wanna
make my parents unhappy.

684
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,309
That's number one.

685
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,811
And number two, we've
talked about this before.

686
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,105
- Yeah, sort of.

687
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,318
- I thought we agreed that
we wouldn't move in together

688
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,528
until we got married.

689
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,572
- You agreed, I didn't.

690
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,036
- I think it's time for
me to go home, pinhead.

691
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,746
- Hey, hey.

692
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,707
Why don't we compromise, okay?

693
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,294
Why don't you spend tonight here, okay?

694
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,130
- I'll think about it.

695
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,967
How about another glass of wine, huh?

696
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,178
- Glass?

697
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,222
Gotta bring the battle.

698
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,892
Right back.

699
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,444
- Okay, look, I'll do the dishes.

700
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,321
You've gotta get some of this trash out.

701
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,406
- Trash? Okay, don't worry about it.

702
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,867
Trash is out, don't worry.

703
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,744
The trash is history.

704
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,415
- Oh, excuse me.

705
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,795
- Get all the trash out,
didn't you want that?

706
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,588
- Great, this is fun.

707
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,675
What are you doing?

708
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,386
- But dad,

709
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,512
dad I --

710
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:06,931
- Fine.

711
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:07,765
Right.

712
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:08,599
Yeah.

713
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:09,433
Whatever you say.

714
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,268
Right.

715
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,102
Talk to you Thursday.

716
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,311
Right.

717
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,274
- Hi.

718
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,233
- Hi.

719
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,110
- What's the matter?

720
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,780
- Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news,

721
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,324
and bad news, and bad news.

722
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,452
- Well, forget the bad news
and tell me the good news.

723
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,329
- Good news is I still love you.

724
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,790
- Oh, shit, what's the bad news?

725
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,086
- Bad news is I got accepted
for the tryouts this summer.

726
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,838
- That's the bad news?

727
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,841
- In Pittsburgh, at the
Pirates Summer Camp.

728
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,134
- You've got to be joking.

729
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,093
- I'm not.

730
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,014
- That's baseball and you're a runner.

731
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,557
- I know that.

732
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,601
But my dad's always wanted me
to have a career in baseball.

733
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,895
And so he's talked to this
scout who works for the Pirates,

734
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,399
and arranged for a tryout.

735
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,903
- I thought we were spending
the summer together, Phil.

736
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,030
- I know.

737
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,241
But if I refuse my dad, he'll
never speak to me again.

738
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,909
He's gone out on a limb
to get me this tryout

739
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,703
and I can't just say screw you.

740
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,414
- But Phil, our plans together!

741
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,915
- Annie, try to understand.

742
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,834
- Okay, nevermind.

743
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,419
If that's all our plans meant to you,

744
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,005
I've got some practicing to do anyway.

745
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,799
- Am I gonna see you later tonight?

746
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,886
Fine, forget it.

747
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,189
- Diane, are you ready?

748
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,057
- I'll just be a moment,

749
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,852
I just came to pick up some
schedules for tomorrow.

750
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:45,858
What was that?!

751
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,909
Jack, pick her up.

752
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,540
- We should go to a hospital.

753
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,209
- No, it won't be necessary.

754
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,252
I think I know what's wrong.

755
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,672
Besides, we don't want any
other doctors nosing around.

756
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,467
Get me a glass of water, please.

757
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,637
Annie, you're gonna be all right.

758
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,599
Did Jordine give you that
new medication today?

759
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,558
- Yes.

760
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,269
- Here, drink this.

761
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,229
Come on.

762
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,233
She'll be fine in a couple of hours.

763
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,443
I'll take her to my place,
she'll be more comfortable.

764
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:30,528
Keep an eye on her.

765
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,782
Put your arm over my shoulder, come on.

766
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,075
Jack, help me.

767
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,502
- Can I please lie down?

768
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,172
- Sure, sure, sure you can lie down.

769
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,799
Just to the couch.

770
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,263
Take off your things while
I fetch you a comforter

771
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,472
and a pillow.

772
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,727
Relax, you're gonna be okay.

773
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,939
You know, sometimes,
these drugs, they backfire

774
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,148
and you get spasms.

775
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,026
It just goes right through your body

776
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,236
and it doesn't leave a trace.

777
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,946
And it's all gonna be
over with, you'll see.

778
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,322
I'll get you some tea.

779
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,783
Take off your things.

780
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,363
- Hello.

781
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,532
- Dr. Jordine, I'm so
sorry to bother you so late.

782
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,452
Listen, Annie's had a serious attack.

783
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,286
- Are you at the gym?

784
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,163
- No, no we're at my house.

785
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,831
- Does anyone else know about it?

786
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,124
- No, only Jack Webber.

787
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,500
- Why the hell did you tell him?

788
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,335
- I didn't.

789
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,170
He was there when it happened.

790
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,088
- You'll be certain no
one else hears about it.

791
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,173
- Of course, I'll be quiet.

792
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,758
- We'll go over her
records in the morning.

793
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:16,717
Goodnight.

794
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,114
- Thanks, Diane.

795
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,204
- Just rest, best rest.

796
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,417
- Those photos look so old.

797
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,211
- They are old.

798
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,426
1936 Olympics.

799
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,136
- Really?

800
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,262
- That's my mother.

801
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,474
She won a gold medal.

802
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:06,767
- Is she dead?

803
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,273
- No, she's not dead.

804
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,818
She's definitely not dead.

805
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:24,284
My mother...my mother's a
very vibrant lady, Annie.

806
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,705
My mother was famous,
people respected my mother.

807
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,125
You should hope that you
could be as dedicated,

808
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,668
as committed as she was.

809
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:38,841
I've been trying to be as
good as my mother all my life.

810
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,221
- Sometimes, I wonder
if it's all worth it.

811
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,349
I mean, the constant workouts,

812
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,018
the stress and the pain.

813
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,066
- Everybody's gotta decide
that for themselves, Annie.

814
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,860
- I don't mean I'm gonna quit.

815
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,779
This is my last chance.

816
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,199
Pretty soon, I'll be too old to compete.

817
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,368
You've gotta help me, Diane.

818
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,246
You've gotta help me, please.

819
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:12,958
- Okay.

820
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,006
Okay, Annie, I'll help you.

821
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,761
Now, just relax, okay? Just rest.

822
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,804
It's all gonna be okay.

823
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,974
It's all gonna be okay.

824
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:42,654
- Hi.

825
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,117
I just heard about last night.

826
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,076
Are you okay?

827
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,205
- I'm much better now, thanks.

828
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,335
- Listen, I was a stupid jerk.

829
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,420
I don't know what got into me.

830
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,631
I guess I never really thought it through.

831
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,592
I just wanna make my dad happy.

832
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,805
But you mean more to me
than anybody, or anything.

833
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,973
And you're right,

834
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,892
I'm a runner, not a baseball player.

835
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,978
What do you say, can you forgive me?

836
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,900
- Well, I've got good news
and I've got bad news.

837
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,904
The good news is that I do forgive you.

838
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,699
And the bad news is I might
not let you forget it.

839
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:28,617
- I'll see you tonight?

840
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,285
- How about tomorrow?

841
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:31,119
- Okay.

842
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,836
- All right, Frank, this
half of your routine,

843
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,839
hold your moves. That's
what makes them world class.

844
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,215
Give it everything you've
got, you can do it.

845
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,842
That's it.

846
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:45,801
That's better.

847
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:47,678
Watch your form.

848
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:48,720
Watch your form.

849
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,516
Push, push, control, control, steady.

850
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,892
Get those legs together.

851
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,310
That's it, go for it.

852
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,438
All right, all right,
dismount. Gimme the dismount.

853
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,273
- Oh, God!

854
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,233
- Frank, are you all right?

855
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,067
- Oh my God, Frank's hurt.

856
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,444
- Don't move, Frank, don't move.

857
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,072
Get Dr. Jordine, or Diane,
and get a stretcher.

858
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,204
- Just relax.

859
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,379
Just try to relax, Frank.

860
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,552
- Oh, shit, it's broken.

861
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,388
- I'm not sure yet.

862
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,223
You're gonna have to have an x-ray.

863
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,767
Jack, help me, please.

864
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,280
I'll call an ambulance.

865
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,657
Take him out on the gurney.

866
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,370
- Okay, guys, give me a hand.

867
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,415
Watch it, easy, easy.

868
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,792
Watch his leg.

869
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:02,669
- No.

870
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,006
- Easy.

871
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,729
- Frank, are you okay?

872
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,105
- Yeah, Lynn, I'm okay.

873
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,774
- Are you sure?

874
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:24,733
- I'm okay!

875
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,793
- Listen, Frank, it's just as
bad for us as it is for you.

876
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,213
- Has anybody ever won
with a cast on, Coach?

877
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,299
- Just wait here for the ambulance, Frank.

878
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,014
- Does it hurt a lot?

879
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:56,974
- Hurt?

880
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,895
I'll tell you what hurts.

881
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,734
I'm out of the Nationals,
that's what hurts.

882
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,655
Don't think about that now.

883
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:12,948
Okay, I'm gonna go get dressed,

884
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:13,865
I'm gonna come with you to the hospital.

885
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,451
- No, I want you to stay here.

886
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,955
Don't go, all right?

887
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,833
I want you to keep
working hard, don't stop.

888
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,797
Because you're gonna win for both of us.

889
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:31,466
All right?

890
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,221
Because you're gonna win for both of us.

891
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,685
- But what I really want is
for you to be the champion.

892
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,854
- Come on, babe, what you talking about?

893
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,442
You're gonna have to be the champ now.

894
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,729
- Ah, come on, Frank,
something's definitely wrong.

895
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,482
Wait a minute, I'll help you out.

896
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,235
- What are you talking about?

897
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,280
- I'm talking about Joe Ward.

898
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,990
Nobody's seen him for two days.

899
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:42,824
- Well, let me tell you something,

900
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:43,992
Joe Ward is weird.

901
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,744
That doesn't mean anything.

902
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,787
- Yeah, well, what about Nancy Wilson?

903
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,289
Is she weird, too?

904
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,957
And Sue Allen?

905
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,501
She hasn't been heard from for four days.

906
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,297
And the strangest part is
nobody's willing to talk about it.

907
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,798
- Oh, come on.

908
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,301
Now, there's got to be
a rational explanation.

909
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,054
- Well, what do you think?
The winners are quitting?

910
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:06,723
- I think something terrible

911
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,600
Is happening here at the academy.

912
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,227
- Like what?

913
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,394
- You want my theory?

914
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,105
I think they're dead.

915
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,523
- Oh, David, lighten up.

916
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:24,908
- Go on, go on, go on, come on.

917
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,159
Don't break your knees.

918
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,410
Don't break your knees.

919
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,373
Go back.

920
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,415
- Hey.
- How you doing?

921
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,792
- Not bad, man.

922
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:35,961
- You ready for Saturday?

923
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:36,920
- Yeah.

924
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,673
- How we gonna do, you think?

925
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,676
- Not bad.

926
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:43,718
Keep going.

927
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,391
- Hi, Frank.

928
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,433
- Hi, Annie. How you doing?

929
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,268
- Fine.

930
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,102
How you feeling?

931
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:52,936
- Not too bad.

932
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,063
I should be outta this
thing in about six weeks.

933
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,314
- Six weeks?

934
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:57,732
Bum wrap.

935
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:58,775
- Yeah, should be okay.

936
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,945
Hey, listen, coach, I'm ready
to start training again.

937
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,990
- Why don't you take just a
couple of more hours rest,

938
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,325
then you can go back to work, Frank.

939
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,036
Okay, kid.
- Listen, you guys seen Lynn?

940
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,038
- She hasn't come in
to work out yet today.

941
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,582
- I haven't seen her all day, either.

942
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,542
- That's weird.

943
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,211
You know, I got home
from the hospital today

944
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:19,337
and she wasn't at home,

945
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,173
and I figured she would've
been here a long time ago.

946
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,301
- She's probably in
the girl's locker room.

947
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,136
- Yeah.

948
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,095
- Yeah.

949
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,266
Okay, listen, I'll see
you guys later, okay?

950
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,518
- Yeah.
- Okay, see you later, Frank.

951
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,996
- Should we carry the paint up now?

952
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,248
- Nah, we gotta scrape the ceiling first.

953
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,296
- Diane.

954
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,797
Diane.

955
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:03,631
- Hello, Frank.

956
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,549
- Is Lynn in there?

957
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:05,383
- No, she's not.

958
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:06,217
- Are you sure?

959
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,552
- We haven't seen her yet today.

960
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,387
- Where the hell could she be?

961
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:10,889
- Oh, I don't know.

962
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:11,723
I have to go.

963
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,266
Will you excuse me?

964
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,402
- Coach Drew, you seen Lynn?

965
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:25,820
- No, I haven't, Frank.

966
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,948
- Where'd you get this?

967
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,283
- Belinda gave it to me.

968
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,619
- This is Lynn's watch.

969
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,288
- Yeah, well, I found it
over there on the ground,

970
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,957
so I suggested that Shelly
use it just for a few minutes.

971
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,167
- Yeah, okay, okay.

972
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,295
If you see Lynn, you tell
her I have her watch. Okay?

973
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,925
- Gosh, I wasn't gonna break it.

974
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,259
- What's wrong with him?

975
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,432
- Drew, where's Lynn Fox?

976
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,809
- How did you know?

977
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:56,851
I was just coming in here to tell you

978
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:00,271
that she didn't show up
for practice this morning.

979
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,357
- So this is how I knew.

980
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,402
Somebody came in here and did this.

981
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,075
Only the four of us have
keys to this office.

982
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,466
- Hello.

983
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,552
- Phil, Phil, it's Frank.

984
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,511
- Frank.

985
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:33,888
Where the hell have you been?

986
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,557
- I've been looking for Lynn.

987
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,391
I'm going crazy.

988
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,267
Her parents are worried sick.

989
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,102
They haven't heard from
her since yesterday.

990
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:39,936
- What?

991
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:40,770
- Something's happened to her,

992
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,897
I need your help to get into the gym.

993
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,400
- What do you think
you're gonna find there?

994
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,359
- I don't know.

995
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,028
But let's look around.

996
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,989
There's gotta be a
reason why Joe, Sue Allen

997
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,408
and Nancy all disappeared.

998
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,077
- Well, their stuff should still
be in their lockers, right?

999
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,455
I guess we could have a look.

1000
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,458
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's at least a start.

1001
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,127
Meet me in front of the gym in 15 minutes.

1002
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:04,961
- Okay.

1003
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:05,920
- All right, bye.

1004
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:26,399
- Hello.

1005
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,109
- Howdy, it's me.

1006
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,527
Listen, Frank just called,

1007
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,530
he's convinced something's
happened to Lynn.

1008
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,657
He wants to go down and
look through her lockers.

1009
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,951
I have to meet him in
about 20 minutes, okay?

1010
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,328
- I'll meet you there.

1011
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,496
- Right, okay.

1012
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:41,581
I'm leaving now.

1013
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:42,499
I love you.

1014
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:43,458
Bye.

1015
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,121
- Oh!

1016
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,360
- Frank?

1017
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:58,828
Frank?

1018
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:04,792
Frank?

1019
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:05,352
Frank?

1020
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,838
- Annie!

1021
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,634
- Oh, he tried to kill me!

1022
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:02,970
- Who tried to kill you? Who?

1023
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,598
- He's crazy, he killed Frank.

1024
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,434
Help me, help me.

1025
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:09,393
Help me.

1026
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:16,233
- Don't worry honey, I saw the
light on in Diane's office.

1027
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:30,998
Diane.

1028
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:32,791
Diane.

1029
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,211
Diane, are you back there?

1030
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:37,671
Diane.

1031
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,259
- Yes, what's the matter?

1032
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,053
- Annie's been hurt.

1033
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,472
- Put her on the table.

1034
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:49,558
I'll be out in a second,
I'm just getting dressed.

1035
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,440
- You gotta hurry, Diane.

1036
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,192
She's bleeding awful bad.

1037
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,486
- Go and call Coach Webber, Phil.

1038
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,363
I'm calling an ambulance right now.

1039
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,283
- Okay.

1040
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,661
- Phil, don't leave me.

1041
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:09,536
- No, don't worry, don't worry.

1042
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,956
- I'm scared.
- You're here with Diane.

1043
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,916
You'll be okay, okay?

1044
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,167
You're gonna be all right.

1045
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,128
- Don't worry Annie, I'll
fix you up in a minute.

1046
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,296
You're gonna be fine.

1047
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:26,804
It's just a flesh wound,

1048
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,223
but I gotta stop the bleeding, all right?

1049
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,101
Don't worry, just hold this here.

1050
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,479
I know you must be in a lot of pain,

1051
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,607
but I'm going to fetch you something

1052
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,444
to put you out your pain.

1053
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,737
Hang in there.

1054
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,409
Few more seconds honey, it'll all be over.

1055
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,423
Annie, I know you're
in here! Where are you?

1056
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:01,982
I am going to have to disqualify you now.

1057
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:07,988
I don't like to have to disqualify you,

1058
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:11,033
but that's what I'm going to have to do.

1059
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:15,245
No!

1060
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,712
I can't stop him.

1061
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,883
I cannot stop him, Annie.

1062
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:35,224
He must disqualify anyone
who might ever make it.

1063
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:41,897
Too bad, hold me back.

1064
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:03,877
Don't you understand?

1065
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,298
I had sacrificed everything.

1066
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,388
I have risked everything just to win.

1067
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:23,272
I even became a woman just to win.

1068
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:35,117
