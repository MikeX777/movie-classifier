1
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:07,401
In the 30’s, an American secret
society became quite notorious.

2
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:11,071
Its members rejected
the whole idea of love,

3
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:14,923
deemed art evil, and claimed
to find the so-called" RAPTURE OF BEING "

4
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:18,372
through a total liberation of the senses.

5
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:22,702
After a congress was held by those
adepts in New York, in September 1937,

6
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:25,717
they weren’t heard of anymore.

7
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:27,705
One year later, a reporter
thought he found them again

8
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:32,532
in the middle of uncharted territories.
He vanished too.

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,455
This movie tells the
story of how some of their daughters

10
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:39,948
came back to live among us.

11
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,515
We can’t leave her like this.

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,547
I gave orders.
They’re coming to get her.

13
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:48,170
Stop erasing this drawing..
They’re waiting for us.

14
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,586
I’m ready.

15
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,869
What’s this laughter outside ?

16
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,325
Samantha is initiating Leonardo.

17
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:06,239
- Group eight is expected at eight thirty. -
They’ve already reached group eight.

18
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,488
- The packing teams are
required to make haste-

19
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,232
Ah, here you are !
She couldn’t take it anymore.

20
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,163
- All seduction objects leaving
with the commando are expected-

21
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:19,967
Get up, little Felicia.

22
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:23,498
- Group six. Group six is expected-

23
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:26,309
I don’t want to see my body.
It’s too large for me.

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,206
- The packing team in charge of
group six is required to make haste-

25
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:37,121
The others are following us.
Let’s go, children.

26
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,989
I can’t get used to
the voices they gave us.

27
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,444
Their females still
have voices like that.

28
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:48,783
I’ve been told they hide to make love.

29
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:11,635
Let’s go.

30
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:16,104
This is my last will and testament.

31
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,851
You have been chosen to build the
foundations of our coming invasion.

32
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,509
Your willpower is
now strong enough

33
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,106
to win over the world
that once exiled us.

34
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:33,176
We made you beautiful,

35
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:37,430
because where you’re going,
beauty is still a privilege.

36
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:45,297
Go, and fight this world where
love is still considered a virtue.

37
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:49,364
Go, and castrate
all of their masters.

38
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,538
All those, who make
them live in fear.

39
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,739
Here are your roses !

40
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,287
Somewhere in our world.

41
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:15,565
Are you crazy ? No, stop !
- Her name is Cascade

42
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,399
No. No, leave me alone.
Stop it. Stop it.

43
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,898
You’re such an animal !

44
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:31,460
I’m getting married tomorrow
anyway, you know.

45
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,772
Will you cut the bullshit already ?

46
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:34,797
Pierre, the gardener.

47
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,074
Don’t you know everybody’s getting
fed-up with your stupidities ?

48
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:45,018
Madame Papadéous, Cascade’s aunt.

49
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,785
Don’t touch Sala’s dress, will you !

50
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,776
She’s getting married, you’re not.

51
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,698
You’d better prepare
Choupeti’s chocolate.

52
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,339
I’ve got to hurry !

53
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,644
Mr. Grop is waiting for me.

54
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,139
Choupeti, the son.

55
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,539
Your chocolate is coming,
little angel.

56
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,142
Cascade is making it now.

57
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,513
You still haven’t kissed me today.

58
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:30,248
Oh no, don’t do that.
Come on, are you mad ? No...

59
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,306
What about the bloody chocolate ?

60
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,182
What the hell are you doing ?

61
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,345
Choupeti is waiting.

62
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,874
It can’t go on like this,
you know, I’m warning you.

63
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,974
And don’t forget the cousins’ book.

64
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:05,431
I wonder where those two are.
Can you tell me ?

65
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,009
Goodbye, my darling.
- Goodbye, Mom.

66
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,169
Bloody bugging fly !

67
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,400
Ah, here you are. Follow me.

68
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,811
Hello, my dear friend.
- Yeah, hello, sorry.

69
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:50,032
Mr. Grop, the mayor.

70
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,476
Please forgive me,
I’m in a hurry,

71
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,665
I can’t keep you long,
'cause I’m very busy.

72
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,050
Please, take a seat.

73
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,080
I asked you to come,

74
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,153
because I’ve been
commissioned with a sale.

75
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,811
The house next door,
you know,

76
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:17,404
the Fogle villa.
Well, it’s been sold.

77
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,151
Werner, Grop’s right hand man.

78
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:21,729
It all happened in
quite an unusual fashion.

79
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,457
First, there was an intervention
of some big wig at the Prefecture.

80
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,981
Some phone calls from the capital city

81
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:32,304
You know me, I like to
be aware of everything.

82
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,306
Yes..

83
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,540
Those people will
probably move in soon.

84
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:39,352
So I’m going to ask you,
since you’re their neighbour,

85
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,970
to take a look, just so we
know who we’re dealing with.

86
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,830
Excuse me, but I’m in a real hurry,
I’m a very busy man.

87
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,589
Werner, will you be nice
enough to see

88
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,825
Mme. Papadéous to the door.
- Good morning, Madame.

89
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:55,288
How is Sala ?
- She’s fine.

90
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,291
Oh, yes, let’s talk
about that wedding !

91
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,604
I think it’s ridiculous.

92
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,347
For a young man who
fancies dabbling in politics,

93
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:04,172
to marry Sala Papadéous,
is madness !

94
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:06,655
Blanche, M. Grop’s wife,
and her servant.

95
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,641
Please do it again.

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,607
I love it.

97
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,424
I see your pleasures
are high brow as ever.

98
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,723
We’re having fun.

99
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:23,960
Don’t you have
anything else to do ?

100
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:28,960
What?

101
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,853
Don’t forget you’re Madame Grop.

102
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,282
As some of us might remember,
during the 1930’s,

103
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:44,308
the American public opinion got
all excited about a secret society

104
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,363
whose adepts were believed
to have acquired

105
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,577
supernatural powers through
various training practices.

106
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,687
I must have left
a handkerchief around here.

107
00:09:54,585 --> 00:10:00,555
Here, wait. I let him get away
with everything. Oh, I’m such a coward.

108
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:06,102
Why do you say this ?
- How I wish I weren’t that way.

109
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,391
In late May 1935,

110
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,081
the members of the sect,

111
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,991
gathered in the lounges of the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.

112
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:17,669
it seems a decision was reached
at the end of this congress since,

113
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,391
from this moment on,
they were never heard of again.

114
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:24,086
The town’s cabaret.

115
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,338
Did you see the glasses ?
- What do I care ?

116
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,149
You’re too much, you know that ?.
- Time to go to bed, gramps !

117
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,888
Oh, here they are now.
- Hi, guys !

118
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:36,722
Hi !

119
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,566
Oh shit, enough is enough !
Here’s your bloody rag.

120
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,538
I’ve got work to do.
Fucking artists !

121
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,643
Cut the bullshit, will you.

122
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:59,476
Here are Ruth and Ivan.
They live with Tristan, a painter.

123
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:00,966
Hi.

124
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,409
Can you still see anything ?

125
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,293
Yeah, I’ve got to finish
this panel for tomorrow.

126
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:05,886
Aren’t you asleep ?

127
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,963
And how’s our star ?

128
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,779
Come on, come on,
you’ve got to sleep, now.

129
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,910
Don’t you think you’re
slightly overdoing it ?

130
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,842
Fuck you.

131
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,689
Why are you like this ?
- Because he’s making fun of me.

132
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,717
The little girl we just saw,
is Ruth’s daughter.

133
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:25,072
As for the blonde, her name is Rita.

134
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:29,046
Trying to make yourself pretty, are you ?
- What seems to be the matter ?

135
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,034
God, this is something else !

136
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:35,671
I think...
the cross-dressing boy, the painter,

137
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:41,247
the sassy black girl and her poor child.
You’re on the wrong path, father,

138
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:44,721
if you begin to feel indulgence
for such creatures.

139
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:47,641
Nowadays, people tend
to forget the devil !

140
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,747
Yes, absolutely, the devil !

141
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:54,540
The point is, the devil may not always be,
where you expect him.

142
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,476
M’Lord ?
- What do you want ?

143
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,423
Your permission to go to bed.
- Go, go !

144
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,848
This is the cardinal’s house.

145
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:09,139
He lives between his secretary
and Marie, his housekeeper.

146
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:12,971
Is she as submissive as she seems ?

147
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:18,913
She’s going to be the first one.

148
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,452
Why she ?
- Because she’s fed-up.

149
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:25,698
I don’t like much the stupidities that
you entertain these days, father.

150
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,736
Give this ring to whom it belongs.

151
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,227
The one he wears on his finger
is a fake

152
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:05,924
since 07.07.1957.

153
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,365
Come and visit us.
We shall quench your appetites.

154
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,989
Our voices are already wandering
among the monsters.

155
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,566
This one is unhappy, isn’t she ?

156
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:56,113
She’s only saved by the tangos in her head.

157
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:57,136
Tangos ?

158
00:14:57,137 --> 00:15:00,646
This is one of their ways,
to feel less lonely.

159
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,592
She hates him.

160
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:33,078
Yes, but there’s a strange perfume
of tenderness.

161
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:09,307
Werner visits Sala Papadéous, his fiancée.

162
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,125
Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

163
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:25,664
Come on, get inside, will you !
I forbid you to go out.

164
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:33,480
Mademoiselle has a rendezvous.
- Yes, I know.

165
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,486
Liberte, Sala’s sister.

166
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,463
Look !

167
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,585
Blanche ! Go and fetch the plane !

168
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,531
I wonder who’ll rid me of that woman !

169
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:14,180
Grop,please stop being childish.
- Well, what’s so important ?

170
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,296
You know my housekeeper ?

171
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:20,885
Yesterday, she came to me claiming
that she had a... visit.

172
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,391
A visit ?
- Yes..

173
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:28,401
Yes. She was visited by a being...
some sort of female being.

174
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:31,788
Well, she doesn’t really know. So, yes,
I roared with laughter, as you would have.

175
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:34,181
But the strange thing is:

176
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:38,471
the visitor left proof of her passage.

177
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:40,445
Proof ?
- A ring.

178
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:43,239
A ring absolutely identical to mine.

179
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,934
She claimed that mine was a fake,
and hers was genuine.

180
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,693
And you believe this bullshit ?

181
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:52,245
Look. The point is not
believing or disbelieving.

182
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,222
It might be more than just poppycock,

183
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:56,630
and I think that perhaps it is a matter
concerning your police.

184
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,920
Because this morning I had the
rings examined by an expert

185
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:03,795
mine is fake, hers is genuine.

186
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:25,048
Is that you ?
I threw everybody out.

187
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,931
It’s so difficult for us to meet.

188
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,221
Do you recognize your tiny ass ?

189
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,591
Look what I do to it.

190
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,437
Do you love me today ?

191
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,810
Did you successfully manage your aunt
and your two bitchy cousins ?

192
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:55,837
What is it ?
She won’t come...

193
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:04,896
Why are you here ?

194
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,799
Why are you here ?

195
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:19,979
I came because...

196
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,045
I told myself...

197
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:31,242
You were supposed to see Cascade,
with the intention of...

198
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,384
So, I thought...

199
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,116
You’re a tramp !

200
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:56,483
Get lost ! Get lost !

201
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:27,526
Tramp...

202
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,540
Asshole !

203
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,623
The cardinal’s housekeeper
answered the Spermulas’ call.

204
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,737
Well, you see, you came.
- Why are you afraid ?

205
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,732
Freedom frightens slaves.

206
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:11,422
It forces us to invent ourselves, when
their world annihilated their imagination.

207
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:14,869
My name is Gilda. I’m the one who
came to you the first time.

208
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,894
Today, you won’t see our mistress.

209
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,720
No, I changed my mind.

210
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:32,064
Are you aware of being
a fantastic medium ?

211
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:48,201
Why do we inspire fear ?

212
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,622
They’re so afraid of being different.

213
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:52,548
Did you see the dread in her eyes ?

214
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,291
She couldn’t bear her
newfound freedom.

215
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,220
Now she’s one of us.

216
00:22:58,221 --> 00:23:00,471
When she wakes up,
you will take her back.

217
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:02,599
We need her outside.

218
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:18,353
Oh, it’s you, mom.

219
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,405
Hey, look at her !
What is she ? Crazy ?

220
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,956
Some people care about politics !

221
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:11,239
We care about music,
partying and magic !

222
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:47,543
On the next morning...

223
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,764
I bet the nigger bitch never fed him.

224
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,381
Where’s my dog ?

225
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,106
Well, here’s his meat.

226
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:11,672
Look how the stupid girl
put that plane down !

227
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,471
Don’t you know where the dog is ?

228
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,507
Can’t you stop this ?

229
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,227
Will you stop already !

230
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,583
You sure are pretty like this.

231
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,310
You make me want to puke.

232
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,611
You make me want to puke...

233
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:36,084
If only you knew !
- If I knew what ?

234
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,355
A pig, that’s what you are !
A monstrosity !

235
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:46,601
If only you knew.
How I love you

236
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:50,420
How I love you...

237
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:10,559
You’re a nice guy, officer.

238
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,080
Good. Very good.

239
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:43,913
Perfect.

240
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:49,859
You are perfect.

241
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:58,404
You pretend to like it,
don’t you, bitch ?

242
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,869
You pretend to like it ?

243
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,462
Yeah!
- No!

244
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,754
Come in.

245
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:23,352
Mr. Werner is here.
- Tell him to come in.

246
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:25,922
You really are a bastard.

247
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:31,942
Good morning, Mme Grop.

248
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:38,626
Good morning, Werner.
You’ll excuse me...

249
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,302
The green-eyed young man who
came to see us. Was he on our side ?

250
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:00,542
Yes. His name is Werner.

251
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:04,885
He's weird..
He has very hard to fathom vibrations.

252
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,182
He’s the right hand man of the
most powerful man in this town,

253
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,078
but he has also been an adept
of ours for ten of their years.

254
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,537
Nevertheless, he seems very preoccupied
with matters of material powers

255
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:19,114
Whatever. We need him.

256
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,931
You always come at the right moment.

257
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:34,071
You still are your old
hugely vulgar self.

258
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:40,180
Your own rudeness proves
you’ve got good news for me.

259
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:42,125
What do you mean ?

260
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:49,565
What I mean, you little cocksucker,
is that you wouldn’t dare to insult me

261
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,277
if you weren’t on the right track.

262
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,316
I think I found the money.

263
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:59,109
Bravo. It was about time. Who ?

264
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,108
We’ll see about that later.
But I have one condition.

265
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,693
A junior partner title and...

266
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,041
Don’t be abused by their stories...

267
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:09,829
It doesn’t matter what confidence
trick those two men may have pulled.

268
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,233
And it doesn’t matter that it was pulled
on the small town they are in charge of.

269
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:14,607
It doesn’t matter
that this woman is searching.

270
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,825
The only thing that matters,
is the rotten perfume...

271
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:18,547
...bathing their lives.

272
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:20,581
I already told you I was
opposed to this marriage.

273
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,696
I’m off.
- All right, all right.

274
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:26,331
As you wish.
I don’t care. When will it be ?

275
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:28,253
I thought the day after tomorrow.

276
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:33,111
Who’s giving the money ?

277
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:39,471
He thinks we’re going
to give him the money.

278
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,630
To them, money is everything.

279
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:44,525
Leave them alone.
You’re exhausting yourself.

280
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:47,387
Let’s go back to work.

281
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:51,093
You’re right. Are you all ready?
We shall resume our immodesty drills.

282
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,415
You ! Go and fetch the male witness.

283
00:31:58,055 --> 00:32:01,610
To be alive, always alive.

284
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,980
On the other side, there is sunlight.

285
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:08,686
It’s there, within reach of the skin.

286
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:11,653
You must hate man and his tyranny.

287
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:15,415
Girls !
The best of them will gladly oblige,

288
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:18,785
and will give life to their poetry.
At last !

289
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:50,492
I knew you were here.

290
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,232
Sala Papadéous. Liberte’s sister
and Werner’s fiancée.

291
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,630
Is mom sleeping ?

292
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,063
What about Choupeti ?
- Don’t know.

293
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,416
Superstitions are afraid
of mirrors for a reason.

294
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,807
Mirrors have a secret,
and a frightful secret it is.

295
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:04,223
There’s something true
on the other side.

296
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,578
In this other space to which
nothing serious can happen.

297
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:15,461
Look at my face.
Watch it closely.

298
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:19,227
As if you were seeing it for the first time.

299
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:22,030
My face is a show.

300
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:24,872
You are attending my face’s show.

301
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:34,643
You are with me.

302
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:41,842
My face is becoming an eternal object.

303
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:46,519
A landscape.. Follow me...

304
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,638
I’m now crossing to the other side

305
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,207
Yes... yes...

306
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:43,648
I don’t love you anymore.
We will never see each other again

307
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,434
The sun.

308
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:22,845
Sala !

309
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:30,730
Hey, here’s your fiancé.
- Hi !

310
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:43,434
You seem pretty self-assured.
- If you knew.

311
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:48,673
If I knew what ?

312
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,907
If I knew what, Werner ?

313
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:57,617
Stop it ! You know perfectly
well that you don’t want to.

314
00:38:58,257 --> 00:38:59,823
It drives me crazy.

315
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:03,478
Kiss !

316
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:20,952
Do I smell good ?
- Like a flower.

317
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,640
It takes a gardener,
to water such a flower.

318
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:45,429
I’m fed-up with it.

319
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,529
Ruth ! Ruth !
- Yes.

320
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,699
Ok.

321
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:07,429
I love you.

322
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,214
I love you too, little man.

323
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,832
No, no, of course not !

324
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,760
You’re missing the point entirely.

325
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,142
You don’t have a clue.
It was like this, I tell you.

326
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:38,749
Here you are.

327
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:44,876
You’re beautiful.

328
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:49,097
What the hell are you doing ?

329
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:51,222
I’ve got work to do in the garden.

330
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,566
He was a...
great hairdresser.

331
00:42:56,621 --> 00:43:01,370
An artist..
There...

332
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,798
Make sure that your own beauty
does not trick you.

333
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,669
Remember your true faces.

334
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:24,532
Gilda ! Are you crazy ?

335
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,488
You may not become
attached to anything.

336
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,407
Do you understand ?

337
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:46,357
You must hate your faces,
these jewels, those ludicrous dresses,

338
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,624
everything that makes you
objects of desire in this world.

339
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,587
I’m telling you this,

340
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,317
because I can feel some of us
weakening.

341
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:59,261
I can feel everything.

342
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:04,872
From childhood, you know ?

343
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:35,236
We must act. We’ve got
the cardinal’s housekeeper.

344
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:38,653
This one will be next.

345
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,433
They’ve been here for three weeks.

346
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:51,676
In order to know so many people, I tell you,
they already had supporters in our town.

347
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:55,127
She even met Tristan,
the painter you don’t like,

348
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:56,395
and commissioned a portrait from him.

349
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:58,772
She met all my former
friends from the cabaret.

350
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:02,938
I think those women have
abnormal powers. They are mediums.

351
00:45:02,939 --> 00:45:05,595
What are you ? Mad ?
What’s all this bullshit?

352
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:10,320
First the cardinal, now you.
A madwoman, that’s what you are.

353
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:13,314
Mediums !
Have you already seen any medium ?

354
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:17,839
You’re mad. You’re unhinged.
Here ! Look at yourself!

355
00:45:19,994 --> 00:45:23,882
Look ! Remember. The oh-so-fresh
Blanche Dubois.

356
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:29,179
The beautiful artist.
A sick wreck, no more.

357
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,246
What do you think ?

358
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:33,793
Mme Grop is tired.
- That’s not what I mean.

359
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:35,634
If you’re referring to those presences,

360
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:38,253
I think... please forgive me, madam...

361
00:45:38,254 --> 00:45:41,175
but I think the whole thing
is preposterous.

362
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:42,987
You can say that again.

363
00:45:42,988 --> 00:45:46,132
I’m going to bed,
that’s the best thing I can do.

364
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:55,291
Preposterous ?

365
00:45:57,026 --> 00:46:01,067
I’ve known you for a long time.
Do you remember, Madame Grop ?

366
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:03,368
Please, do not get
interested in their stories.

367
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:06,454
Stories are good for men of the past.

368
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:10,758
Know only that in this instant,
a being exists is this very light.

369
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:16,132
If you fuck with me, even a little,
I’ll destroy you.

370
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,848
Little Werner.

371
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:55,332
This is great, I must say.

372
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:22,954
He’s terribly repressed. Look.

373
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:26,264
Yes. He can’t rise
above common visions.

374
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:30,565
He knows only the primary phase.
We’ve got to mutate him.

375
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:32,038
I can’t.

376
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,019
Yes you can. He’s now gone to
the other side.

377
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,164
He’s ours.

378
00:47:57,448 --> 00:48:00,952
Now you’re free. No pride, no anguish.

379
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:04,440
You’ll never be a man of the past again.

380
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:51,846
It’s so good.

381
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:14,881
She was the most profound,
the most visionary of them all,

382
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:18,614
and she allowed herself to fall into
the crudest, the most illusory of traps.

383
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:21,624
Love..
- Did she have a bad night ?

384
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,867
Yes.
- I’ll go and see her.

385
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:27,306
I fail to understand why they chose her.
She lacks strength.

386
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:34,752
Here, take this. It will do you good.

387
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:41,275
Close the curtains, will you ?
The light is killing me.

388
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,214
Are you not feeling well, darling ?

389
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:52,550
It’s nothing. Probably this world.

390
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:54,192
I miss teaching.

391
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:59,074
Today, we’ll resume our listening.

392
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:04,647
You know, I’m receiving a weird
thing since earlier today.

393
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:10,528
There is love around here, I can feel it.
It makes me want to puke.

394
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:12,875
You’re being silly. There’s only
hate among our neighbours.

395
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,500
Shut up ! I feel it, I tell you !

396
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:22,690
You’re tickling me.
You’re really crazy, aren’t you ?

397
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,508
It’s funny. I feel like
biting you like this.

398
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:28,534
I’ll swallow you. I’ll digest you.

399
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:30,319
You’re being gross.

400
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:34,608
That’s rich, coming from you
who likes talking only about sex.

401
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:38,613
That’s true. I like it.
Why do I like it ?

402
00:50:38,614 --> 00:50:41,373
It’s because... because you’re...

403
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:43,467
Well, shit !

404
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,962
This is really fucking good. Really good.

405
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:24,444
My Man ! You’re so silly !

406
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,019
What’s happening with the gardener ?

407
00:51:35,622 --> 00:51:39,854
It seems to have failed.
- Why do you say that ?

408
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:44,486
Because I can see it.
He’s not been freed in the right way.

409
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:53,860
What do you want ?
- Is your mother home ?

410
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:58,646
No...
What’s the matter ?

411
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:08,077
Are you crazy ? What’s with you ?
You’re not yourself !

412
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,622
Take a seat.

413
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,022
Blanche, my darling,
will you close the door ?

414
00:52:15,976 --> 00:52:19,952
I asked you to come here tonight
in order to announce Werner’s promotion

415
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:21,845
and his engagement to Sala Papadéous.

416
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:23,198
I’m really happy.

417
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,431
But I also want to talk
about something else.

418
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,846
It makes me think that what happened
to you is somehow happening to me.

419
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:26,872
If you’re anything like me...

420
00:52:26,873 --> 00:52:31,354
Oh, no ! My love is much lower
than that. Will you excuse me ?

421
00:52:31,355 --> 00:52:35,390
...and I asked Werner to investigate.
No result.

422
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:40,929
What’s really bothering me,
is that each time I asked a question

423
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,809
about those people to
someone in the capital city...

424
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,180
Would you like a drink ?
- I’d like a glass of water, please.

425
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:51,741
Each time, they led me to
understand that I’d better... well,

426
00:52:51,742 --> 00:52:53,615
in a nutshell..
leave the matter alone.

427
00:52:53,616 --> 00:52:57,817
That’s why I think it’s our
responsibility to shed light on it.

428
00:52:57,818 --> 00:53:02,660
So I’m going to ask you, Countess,
and also you, Your Lordship,

429
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:05,244
to kindly pay a visit to those people,

430
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,951
in order to learn who we’re dealing with.

431
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,830
Yes. I understand.
Thank you.

432
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:19,585
Werner warns us that the cardinal
is only willing to come to dinner

433
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:23,364
in order to learn about us.
An investigation of sorts.

434
00:53:26,428 --> 00:53:31,329
Come and see. It’s strange

435
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:37,392
she kept looking over her shoulder,
as if she could feel my presence.

436
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:42,561
I think she’s a natural at listening.

437
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:48,406
When was it ?
- Thirty-six hours ago.

438
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:52,056
We should be able to do it.

439
00:53:52,057 --> 00:53:56,295
That man, Grop,
doesn’t receive any fluid.

440
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:59,337
We can only reach him through her.

441
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:22,534
Blanche will be theirs soon.

442
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:25,374
As for the cardinal, they’re
waiting for him this very evening.

443
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:28,254
And the next morning...

444
00:54:29,094 --> 00:54:30,927
Some friends told me you
weren’t feeling very well.

445
00:54:30,928 --> 00:54:33,584
I’m all right, don’t worry.

446
00:54:35,154 --> 00:54:39,600
Images are coming back to me.
When was that dinner with the cardinal ?

447
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:54,124
I must say the colour of your robe,

448
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:59,668
your complexion and those
tiny prawns create a harmony...

449
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:02,331
Thanks.

450
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:07,511
Nice of you to let me come.
- I’m glad to see you.

451
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:13,470
Why have you covered
the paintings like this ?

452
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,887
It’s soothing me.

453
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:18,973
Do you know what ?

454
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:23,330
No...

455
00:55:23,331 --> 00:55:26,781
So this is their solution
to cross to the other side...

456
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:31,392
Love... My little trick...

457
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:36,086
In fact, M’Lord, you can understand us
better than many others.

458
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:40,732
My girls and I are living
in a kind of community.

459
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:41,914
Yes, I see.

460
00:55:41,915 --> 00:55:45,163
Do you know we own absolutely
exceptional collections ?

461
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:46,417
Do you ?

462
00:55:46,418 --> 00:55:51,137
And we’re going to show
you some of our treasures...

463
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:02,568
I’d like to know how to draw.
Would you like it ?

464
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:06,323
Maybe I would, yes.

465
00:56:08,373 --> 00:56:11,102
What’s wrong with me. I’m crazy.

466
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:14,395
Are you all right ?

467
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:18,347
I cannot stay.
I need to wash my hands.

468
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,134
Thank you.

469
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:34,039
Oh, yes, I’m all right. Well...
I think we’ll take a break.

470
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:38,726
Please excuse me.
Feeling a bit dizzy.

471
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:44,965
I... er... I leave you here.
You may stay as long as you want.

472
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:48,308
May I take your drawing ?

473
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:50,703
Well... yes...
Although I don’t like it much.

474
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:53,265
Thank you.

475
00:56:57,504 --> 00:57:00,530
What happened ?
- Don’t know.

476
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:01,757
She’s scaring me.

477
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:03,687
She’s just a little weird.

478
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,724
You’re pretty when you’re scared.

479
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,186
You’re crazy. She’ll be back.

480
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,121
Concentrate. Let’s lead him
to the swimming pool,

481
00:57:26,122 --> 00:57:30,209
where our girls are waiting for him.

482
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:34,271
Erase this drawing, Ingrid.
Erase it now.

483
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:37,440
Like before. Nothing must remain.

484
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:38,523
I can’t. I can’t anymore.

485
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:43,902
Time is shifting. It’s their doing.
Their love is destroying you.

486
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:47,302
Free yourself from them, Ingrid.
- I can’t.

487
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:51,006
I’ll do it for you.
- No. They’re mine.

488
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,455
Help me !

489
00:57:54,456 --> 00:58:00,186
You’re our master, Ingrid.
- Leave me alone, then. Leave me.

490
00:58:00,187 --> 00:58:01,934
I’m leaving you.

491
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:04,678
But remember that you
must flee only poets,

492
00:58:05,195 --> 00:58:07,676
those who already own
a version of the rapture.

493
00:58:07,677 --> 00:58:12,527
substitutes of life that they excrete,
help people weathering the bad times...

494
00:58:12,528 --> 00:58:16,153
help people weathering the bad times...

495
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:21,060
He’s coming closer.
He’s almost here. He’s here

496
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:32,273
As for this couple,
I think you see too much of them.

497
00:59:32,274 --> 00:59:34,822
And I think asking him for
that drawing was ridiculous.

498
00:59:34,823 --> 00:59:36,288
Before, you loved erasing them,

499
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:38,608
it was so simple...
- This is none of your business.

500
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:42,409
I like them. If only they didn’t
reek so much of love...

501
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:45,059
You must free them of this crap.
What are you waiting for ?

502
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,026
Do what must be done.
They’re grotesque.

503
00:59:47,027 --> 00:59:50,684
I make the decisions.
- You make the decisions.

504
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:54,642
We’re not well. We have to
take up the listenings again.

505
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:58,898
Tell me, how many times
did the artist come here ?

506
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:03,861
He came three times in the flesh,
and several times more as waves.

507
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:07,447
When was the first time ?
- The first time wasn’t important.

508
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:10,497
I think it was the second
time which did the trick.

509
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:14,481
I don’t remember what I was doing.

510
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:20,806
Oh, yes, I was painting my nails,
or some absurd thing like that.

511
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:28,520
Hello.
- Good evening.

512
01:00:31,914 --> 01:00:37,300
It’s strange. Before, when I saw you, sir...
- Don’t call me sir.

513
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:42,518
When I saw you, Tristan, I felt ill.

514
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:45,595
An when I see you now,

515
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:49,365
I feel very very well.

516
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,641
Where is Cascade?

517
01:00:56,017 --> 01:00:59,737
I tell you they’ve been drinking.
This is not normal.

518
01:01:01,856 --> 01:01:03,483
Why are you staring at me ?

519
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:07,091
Maybe it’s time for you to know.

520
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:10,742
Come and see.
Come and see, will you ? Come !

521
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:14,980
You see, you’re not exactly
up to date, honey.

522
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:17,276
Don’t you think it’s time to let her know ?

523
01:01:17,277 --> 01:01:21,302
She must know that you visited next door,
and you’ll never be the same again,

524
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:23,849
so she’ll shed her oh so proper attitude.

525
01:01:26,428 --> 01:01:29,262
And it’s not only you. I went there too.

526
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:31,657
Pierre put in my womb,
something from next door.

527
01:01:31,658 --> 01:01:33,689
Something from madness.

528
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,218
Oh, I forgot, you didn’t know.

529
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:40,898
Pierre has been fucking me for
a long time. Yes, he does fuck me.

530
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:43,711
And he fucks Sala too. Princess Sala!

531
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:48,126
She takes him full in the arse.
Yes, my dear mommy, full in the arse.

532
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:53,735
Several miles worth of prick.
Isn’t it true, little Sala ?

533
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,366
Sala ? It’s not true, is it ?
- Can’t you see they’re crazy ?

534
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,235
Come. You’ll stay in Grop’s house
until our wedding.

535
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,857
Everything will be alright.
Grop isn’t home.

536
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:45,116
The maid will let you in.
Wait for me !

537
01:02:46,484 --> 01:02:51,364
Tell me, Liberte was telling
the truth, wasn’t she ?

538
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,280
Our victory is imminent.

539
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:10,175
How is it going with the mother ?

540
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,265
It’s done. She’s with us.
Shall I tell or shall I project ?

541
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:18,290
Project. Let’s not indulge
our awful physical voices.

542
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:22,458
It wasn’t hard. She already
lived a parallel life.

543
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:26,797
I put her in contact with her late husband.
He was a hairdresser.

544
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:33,513
Don’t fret. I was sure he would come.

545
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:36,763
Give me my curling iron, Sausage !

546
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:39,819
He wasn’t always nice to me.

547
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,756
The seconds. All the seconds !

548
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:46,023
The billions seconds of life !

549
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:49,991
Like ants ! A regular anthill !

550
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,650
They eat me, they bore in me,
they get fat on me !

551
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:59,373
Darling ? Darling ?
Do you still love me ?

552
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:07,281
I would like to see your face !

553
01:04:15,937 --> 01:04:17,717
She’s done with love.

554
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:19,607
She’ll never be the same again.
- She’ll never be the woman she was.

555
01:04:19,608 --> 01:04:21,816
What became of the cardinal ?

556
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:24,823
And what about the rich man’s wife ?
The Blanche woman.

557
01:05:24,824 --> 01:05:27,771
Blanche !
- She’s on her way.

558
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:55,666
What bitches...
Where are the fucking sluts ?

559
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:31,923
Their violence is a strange thing.

560
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:34,081
They don’t know how
to live in freedom.

561
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:38,094
No matter. He’s ours.
- Yes, he’s ours.

562
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:47,746
Oh, my God ! My God !

563
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:16,257
Hello ?
- It’s me. Blanche is gone.

564
01:07:16,258 --> 01:07:18,430
Yeah ? Well, she’s gone anyway.

565
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:21,755
She must be at the cabaret.
See that it’s raided.

566
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:23,792
But...
- No buts, little Werner.

567
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:27,170
If you don’t see that
the matter is settled tonight,

568
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:29,664
don’t count on me tomorrow
morning for your wedding.

569
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:31,065
Get it ?

570
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,067
Alright !

571
01:07:33,723 --> 01:07:36,378
Tell the blokes in the militia not
to pull their punches

572
01:07:36,413 --> 01:07:38,783
we don’t often have the opportunity
to teach a lesson to those degenerates.

573
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:40,434
See you tomorrow.

574
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:51,082
I can’t do it. I can’t do it.

575
01:07:53,255 --> 01:07:58,676
They do not receive me.
I can’t unscramble.

576
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:04,506
Take a hold of yourself, Ingrid.
We must go on.

577
01:08:04,507 --> 01:08:06,851
The Black girl ?
You had her, didn’t you ?

578
01:08:06,852 --> 01:08:12,166
Yes. I called her this morning.
- Was it hard ?

579
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:17,726
The Black one. The Black girl.
In the cabaret.

580
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:24,243
Ruth... Yes, that’s it, Ruth. I met her.

581
01:08:24,244 --> 01:08:28,745
In a big, in a huge city...

582
01:08:39,187 --> 01:08:44,160
Very far. In 1950.
- That is not possible.

583
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,398
You weren’t born.

584
01:08:48,786 --> 01:08:54,288
I need her.
She’s threatened.

585
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,784
Images came back to me.

586
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:01,634
Images blocked my sight.

587
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:05,148
Oh, those harassing images !

588
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,504
Ruth...

589
01:09:14,428 --> 01:09:19,479
Ruth... Ruth...

590
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,359
You’re one of us now.

591
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:51,413
It’s hard ! Help me, I’m loosing her.

592
01:09:51,414 --> 01:09:54,577
So what ? You succeeded. She’s ours.

593
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:59,535
Don’t you understand ? I’m not worried
about our victory, but about my defeat.

594
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:02,484
Can’t you see this world is taking us ?

595
01:10:02,485 --> 01:10:08,174
Diamant !
Help me ! Help me !

596
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:11,316
I’m coming with you for the very
last time. This is outrageous.

597
01:10:11,317 --> 01:10:13,393
Hey, you, human flesh merchant !

598
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:16,021
While Ivan and Tristan are taking a stroll,

599
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:20,298
M. Grop’s policemen are
doing their job at the cabaret.

600
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:22,237
Up you go !
- Yes.

601
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,188
Are you OK ?
- Yeah.

602
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:31,609
How happy will M. Grop be !
- No !

603
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:36,184
You’re a funny sight upside down.
I like you.

604
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:38,034
I like you too, little man.

605
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,096
Who else among you feels pleasure in
looking at their reflection in a mirror ?

606
01:10:49,097 --> 01:10:53,377
Strangely enough, recently, I’ve been
having emotions that were unknown to me.

607
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:59,494
Which ones ?
Tell me.

608
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:03,769
Must I really, Diamant ?

609
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:09,563
It’s necessary. This is the reason
why we’re losing our power.

610
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:12,996
Is this a new feeling for you ?

611
01:11:12,997 --> 01:11:16,188
To take those feelings away from them,
is the very reason why we came here

612
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:17,845
It was shame, wasn’t it ?

613
01:11:17,846 --> 01:11:19,650
That’s what you felt ?
- Yes.

614
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:23,534
Pride too, and you wanted to be loved.
Is that why you did what you did ?

615
01:11:23,535 --> 01:11:26,199
You knew ?
- Here we know everything.

616
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:32,169
And you know what’s coming to you.
- No, please !

617
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:49,884
Oh shit !

618
01:11:53,988 --> 01:11:57,300
What is it ? What happened ?
Where’s the kid ?

619
01:12:00,407 --> 01:12:01,881
Oh, God, I’ll get him !

620
01:12:03,263 --> 01:12:04,832
Ruth is all right.

621
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,441
She’s gone to see the women
in the villa across the road.

622
01:12:07,442 --> 01:12:10,032
Who did this ?
- M. Grop.

623
01:12:28,331 --> 01:12:30,676
Here. Put this on.

624
01:12:39,432 --> 01:12:42,735
Are you all right ?
- Yes, I’m better.

625
01:12:42,736 --> 01:12:47,864
You feel better, don’t you ?
Can I introduce him ?

626
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:49,408
Yes.

627
01:13:09,728 --> 01:13:12,667
Good morning, Werner.
- Good Morning, Ingrid.

628
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,453
Don’t touch that.

629
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:21,802
This is a very good copy.
- No, an original.

630
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:27,125
This is genuine.
The one in the Prado is a copy.

631
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:29,639
The same goes for the Mona Lisa,

632
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:33,328
the picture in the
Louvre museum is a forgery.

633
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,747
For forty years,
we’ve been working on the

634
01:13:35,748 --> 01:13:37,038
exchange of your valuables, you know

635
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,270
I know. Yours is a formidable power.

636
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:43,965
That’s why I’ve been wondering,
why are you unwilling to help me ?

637
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:47,278
We have many contacts
in the whole world,

638
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,057
and many of them have
already been compromised.

639
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,485
We’re none the worst for it.

640
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:57,244
I’m not sure I can trust you, Werner.

641
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:02,977
Look. I’m on the verge
of reaching my goal.

642
01:14:02,978 --> 01:14:05,833
I’ve been fighting for it for ten years.

643
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:09,426
You say you’re one of us,
little Werner.

644
01:14:09,427 --> 01:14:14,374
I can see you’re still motivated by things
which are utterly meaningless to us.

645
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:18,579
To us, this power is nothing.

646
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,710
If it leads to slavery, it’s nothing,
just like money.

647
01:14:24,922 --> 01:14:26,814
For you, other people are rabble,

648
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:29,091
but you’re proving that
you have no nobility.

649
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:33,151
None at all. You know nothing
of the beauty of failure.

650
01:14:33,152 --> 01:14:35,541
You know nothing of the absurd.

651
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:38,429
What gives you the right
to speak to me like that ?

652
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,211
Obviously,
you’ve never been humiliated.

653
01:14:41,212 --> 01:14:43,538
What do you know of my problems ?

654
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:45,659
Nothing, that’s for sure.
Nothing at all.

655
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:50,092
You should take me too,
while you’re at it.

656
01:14:50,093 --> 01:14:52,913
Why don’t you try it with me ?

657
01:14:52,914 --> 01:14:55,653
You took Pierre, after all.

658
01:14:55,654 --> 01:14:58,173
And the bishop didn’t escape you.

659
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,216
And Liberte through Pierre.

660
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:02,776
And the bishop’s housekeeper
through the bishop himself.

661
01:15:02,777 --> 01:15:08,009
What about me ? Why not ?
Take me.

662
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:13,157
Make me one of you,
so I can be free your way.

663
01:15:25,064 --> 01:15:27,586
Werner, no ! Werner... Werner !

664
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:33,271
Werner ! Stop it ! Werner, no !

665
01:15:39,194 --> 01:15:42,267
Werner, no ! Please, Werner.

666
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:46,235
Stay back. Stay back !

667
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:49,788
Stop !

668
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:54,152
Werner !

669
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:05,448
I know a lot about
your activities here.

670
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:06,672
And elsewhere too.

671
01:16:06,673 --> 01:16:09,392
Beware !

672
01:16:09,393 --> 01:16:13,219
You’re very strong,
but you’re not invulnerable.

673
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,272
Remember that.

674
01:16:41,271 --> 01:16:43,010
Tell me. What is love ?

675
01:16:44,247 --> 01:16:47,822
Love ?
It’s a river in Russia.

676
01:16:51,101 --> 01:16:52,633
Stop !

677
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,527
Stop being stupid.
Just stop it, alright ?

678
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:01,494
If you don’t,
I’ll punch you in the face.

679
01:17:01,495 --> 01:17:04,368
But I tell you I loved her.
Can’t you understand ?

680
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:08,308
Why are you saying you loved her,
when she’s all right ? She’s here !

681
01:17:29,807 --> 01:17:31,063
Don’t do this, you dummy !

682
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:39,676
Come on, hurry up ! Come on !
We’re going to... hurry up !

683
01:17:41,371 --> 01:17:42,412
Let’s go and see Ruth.

684
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:52,909
Bastards ! Motherfuckers ! Bastards,

685
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,757
I’ll get them !

686
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:52,275
Come ! Oh, come ! Come !

687
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,451
So many are left here !

688
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:04,728
Their pleasures ! Their pleasures
don’t take them anywhere.

689
01:19:06,718 --> 01:19:10,700
Satisfaction. Only satisfaction...

690
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:20,476
This party is going to be our victory.
- Yes, maybe.

691
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:25,326
What’s the matter with you now ?
- Don’t bother.

692
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,013
Pierre !

693
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:28,782
Look, nobody came
to our wedding dinner.

694
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:43,658
We’ll tell them the truth,
of course, but that truth,

695
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:48,051
believe me, most of them
can’t understand it.

696
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:51,597
I’m afraid they’ll think it’s absurd.

697
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:55,437
Most of them have...
only feelings as they say.

698
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:57,593
My duty was to
report to my superiors.

699
01:20:57,594 --> 01:21:01,156
I’m disappointed.
I’ve been told to forget it all.

700
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:05,468
You don’t say ?
You’re completely drunk, poor chap.

701
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:11,092
The father is not drunk.
You are, Grop.

702
01:21:11,093 --> 01:21:16,688
What the father just said is true.
It’s part of the truth.

703
01:21:16,689 --> 01:21:19,583
I’m going to tell you the rest.

704
01:21:20,218 --> 01:21:22,637
You uttered the word,
love

705
01:21:22,638 --> 01:21:27,236
Yes. Yes, I’m becoming
a mortal again,

706
01:21:27,237 --> 01:21:29,556
since love makes one mortal,

707
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:32,316
at the same time giving life.

708
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,133
Beware. You know I’m prepared to do
anything to save you.

709
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,663
Are you sure you
won’t touch Tristan ?

710
01:21:52,057 --> 01:21:54,122
This is why I told you
that we would be able,

711
01:21:54,123 --> 01:21:57,297
to pose as saviours in the public eye,

712
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,411
just by exposing the case.

713
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:03,235
If that were true,
you wouldn’t frown like this.

714
01:22:03,236 --> 01:22:05,755
You would already be calling
the press on the phone.

715
01:22:05,756 --> 01:22:08,194
Sir !

716
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:11,706
For ten years,
I was an adept of those people.

717
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,960
What I just revealed...
- What game are you playing, Werner ?

718
01:22:15,961 --> 01:22:19,904
Follow me, M. Grop, and you’ll see

719
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:21,865
that what I’m telling you is true.

720
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:09,911
How does your religion
deal with people who sin ?

721
01:23:09,912 --> 01:23:13,146
They’re being punished.
- Yeah ? How are they punished.

722
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,170
They’re flogged.

723
01:23:22,094 --> 01:23:23,382
Where is there a phone ?

724
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:26,726
It’s too early for that, M. Grop.

725
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:29,770
Before that, I want to
show you something.

726
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:30,810
What ?

727
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,584
Open the door, Werner !

728
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:51,885
Fuck me. Don’t mind him.

729
01:23:56,001 --> 01:23:58,593
How is it going, Gramps ?
- How handsome he is in his tuxedo !

730
01:23:58,594 --> 01:24:01,890
Come on.
- Yeah, I’m making space for you.

731
01:24:11,354 --> 01:24:17,059
Oh, Albert, don’t tell me
you’re freaking out.

732
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:22,779
I’m even sure that you love it.
Don’t you ?

733
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,192
Oh, no, he’s really in pain.
He can’t stand losing.

734
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:40,819
Your pride is what’s hurting you,
Albert. Your pride.

735
01:24:43,531 --> 01:24:46,042
Those strangers have been
telling me a lot of things.

736
01:24:48,318 --> 01:24:51,656
Come with us ! It feels great.

737
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:56,471
Come... with us.

738
01:24:56,472 --> 01:25:00,666
Come. Come.

739
01:26:18,836 --> 01:26:22,572
I love you !
I love you, little one.

740
01:26:37,422 --> 01:26:42,947
They’re right. Everything is beautiful,
it’s true. You are beautiful.

741
01:26:44,187 --> 01:26:49,334
Don’t say things like that.
I’m ugly as hell.

742
01:26:49,335 --> 01:26:51,176
No. Why do you say that ?

743
01:26:51,177 --> 01:26:54,984
If I were beautiful,

744
01:26:54,985 --> 01:26:57,586
what with all the trouble
I take to make you love me,

745
01:27:00,462 --> 01:27:02,474
would you love me anyway ?

746
01:27:02,475 --> 01:27:05,743
Well, she’s going
to give herself to him,

747
01:27:05,744 --> 01:27:08,479
and he will lose what
he still calls his love.

748
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,384
Before, I liked you.
Now I really love you.

749
01:27:18,227 --> 01:27:21,312
Come ! I’m going to show you
the images haunting the little man.

750
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:14,174
You’ll never be a man of
the past again. Never again.

751
01:28:14,175 --> 01:28:19,861
As long as no woman of our race,
is crazy enough to give herself to you.

752
01:28:40,975 --> 01:28:45,322
I spilled everything to her.
The truth.

753
01:28:45,323 --> 01:28:49,476
It’s true, I told her everything.

754
01:28:49,477 --> 01:28:53,657
Can’t you see that it’s killing me ?

755
01:28:53,658 --> 01:28:57,636
I need her now.
I need Sala.

756
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,247
And I absolutely need the money.

757
01:29:01,248 --> 01:29:04,017
Not for me, of course,
but for her.

758
01:29:04,018 --> 01:29:07,123
Because I love her.
I do love her.

759
01:29:08,297 --> 01:29:10,948
I also need that swine, Grop.

760
01:29:10,949 --> 01:29:15,248
I was your ally once.
Help me !

761
01:29:53,915 --> 01:29:55,932
What’s with you ?

762
01:30:04,664 --> 01:30:07,898
Gilda ! Follow me !

763
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:12,004
No, Diamant, no. I don’t want
my former face back.

764
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:17,936
You drove me mad, Ingrid

765
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:25,183
I don’t know how to draw anymore.
I don’t know how to draw !

766
01:30:26,586 --> 01:30:32,565
He’s mad, Albert.
Albert is mad.

767
01:30:44,871 --> 01:30:48,633
You’re free now.
- You knew ?

768
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:54,588
I suspected.
I can feel it when I see you.

769
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:59,215
So I’m free ?
But free to do what ?

770
01:30:59,216 --> 01:31:01,929
Free to live on a large scale
what your miserable love

771
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:04,265
allows you to think
you’re living on a small one.

772
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:07,893
To live ?
What do you mean, to live ?

773
01:31:07,894 --> 01:31:10,968
I’m living ! In order to have lived !
To remember !

774
01:31:10,969 --> 01:31:13,161
And to extract from those memories

775
01:31:13,162 --> 01:31:15,635
something that will allow
other people to live.

776
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:20,436
Ersatz.
- Maybe so.

777
01:31:20,437 --> 01:31:23,173
But what are you suggesting ?

778
01:31:23,174 --> 01:31:26,847
Maybe there, in you little
confined world, but not here.

779
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,707
No in this huge mess.

780
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:32,993
Freedom!
I’m not even free to love her !

781
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:37,167
And I want to love,
do you hear me ?

782
01:31:39,299 --> 01:31:42,227
I can give you back,
what was taken from you.

783
01:31:42,228 --> 01:31:46,940
How ?
- I have to give myself to you.

784
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:53,871
What will happen to you ?
- Nothing.

785
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:29,687
See your friend Gilda ?

786
01:34:29,688 --> 01:34:33,407
She’s just finding her former
face again. Her real face.

787
01:34:33,408 --> 01:34:37,753
You’ve lost, Ingrid,
and you can feel it. Lost.

788
01:36:08,268 --> 01:36:11,435
I love him.

789
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:48,713
We came too early.

790
01:37:48,714 --> 01:37:51,337
First, it’s necessary to cure them.

791
01:37:51,338 --> 01:37:53,863
They’re too seriously ill.

792
01:38:23,438 --> 01:38:25,905
Ingrid !

793
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,222
Farewell.

794
01:39:07,223 --> 01:39:09,124
Why does she escape the law ?

795
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:11,774
This is a privilege,
of the angels of the future.
