00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,451
<i>Well, sir, I reckon
we got us a fine town here.</i>

3
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,887
<i>A fine town!</i>

4
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,191
<i>Friendly, peaceful-like.</i>

5
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,094
<i>Good folks, just going about their lives
doing the best they can.</i>

6
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,403
Yep, wide open spaces

7
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,701
where you can dig
a nice deep burrow

8
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,241
for your family to live in.

9
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,933
Plenty of tumbleweeds

10
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,444
and insects to feed your babies.

11
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,440
But there is a danger

12
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,575
that threatens our very way of life.

13
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,683
I... hate... prairie dogs.

14
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,782
What's all the commotion, Duke?

15
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,856
Caught us a predator, Ma!

16
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,321
Get his stuff!

17
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,154
Yay!

18
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,339
<i>Welcome to this Western town</i>

19
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>There's more to see
if you're looking down</i>

20
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,710
<i>Just beneath the surface while you wait</i>

21
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,972
<i>Beneath that land so serene</i>

22
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,847
<i>Is a Wild West seldom seen</i>

23
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,511
<i>Where prairie dogs in numbers congregate</i>

24
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,520
<i>Just step right up to the old dirt mound</i>

25
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,359
<i>And hop on down to the underground</i>

26
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,730
<i>A tunnel's-length away
is where we're set</i>

27
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,826
<i>When you break on through
to the other side</i>

28
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,066
<i>It's a Broadway Baby
where the streets are wide</i>

29
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,540
<i>It's a visit you're not likely to forget</i>

30
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,211
<i>Six feet under
It's a world of wonder</i>

31
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,308
<i>We don't mean Boot Hill
where the cowboys rest</i>

32
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,346
<i>Down here ain't no steer or horse</i>

33
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,218
<i>Just us prairie dogs, of course</i>

34
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,656
<i>We're the best durned town
in all the West!</i>

35
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,028
<i>There's a one-room school
and a big hotel</i>

36
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,996
<i>An undertaker and a wishing well</i>

37
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,499
<i>A general store that's right there
on the street</i>

38
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,666
<i>So drop on down to our new town hall</i>

39
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,601
<i>There might be a wedding
or even a brawl!</i>

40
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,173
<i>Our hospitality just can't be beat</i>

41
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,180
<i>Up above we take care</i>

42
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,050
<i>We're gonna hide if we see you stare</i>

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,418
<i>Down here we whoop it up
to beat the band</i>

44
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,920
<i>There's music here and fun and vittles</i>

45
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,858
<i>Where youngs and olds
and bigs and litties</i>

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,625
<i>Do the best durned line dance
in the land</i>

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,770
<i>Let's slow this down</i>

48
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:42,814
<i>We're getting ahead</i>

49
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,541
<i>Up above where the light is shed</i>

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,247
<i>There's a cat and a mouse
who always make us smile</i>

51
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,651
<i>So attend this tale as we wait below</i>

52
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,418
<i>We know you'll enjoy this great big show</i>

53
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,951
<i>Sit back, honey,
kick off your boots and stay awhile</i>

54
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,663
<i>Six feet under
It's a world of wonder</i>

55
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,566
<i>We don't mean Boot Hill
where the cowboys rest</i>

56
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,801
<i>Down here ain't no steer or horse</i>

57
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,770
<i>Just us prairie dogs, of course</i>

58
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,241
<i>We're the best durned town
in all the West</i>

59
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,669
<i>Way down yonder</i>

60
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,475
<i>On any scale it's a whale of a tale</i>

61
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,310
<i>Don't take no time to ponder</i>

62
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,442
<i>Bet your dollar It's a hoot and a holler</i>

63
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,648
<i>We're the best durned town
in all the West</i>

64
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,688
<i>We're the best</i>

65
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,123
<i>In the West</i>

66
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,628
<i>- We best begin
- So let's dig in</i>

67
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,032
Aye, not the corral again!

68
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,865
Always something around here
that's falling off or caving in

69
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,703
or got broke or won't work or...

70
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,935
Aye, cut it out, you two.
Let's get some breakfast.

71
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,944
Morning, Bumpy.

72
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,350
Morning, everybody.

73
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,783
Wait, where are the boys?

74
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,783
Oh, great. Something else to fix.

75
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,633
You know the whole gol' durned
ranch is nearly busted, Betty.

76
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,066
Why, if I hadn't promised your grandad

77
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,467
that I'd always be here for ya,

78
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,470
I'd have hit the trail long ago.

79
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,605
And what did Gramps
always tell you?

80
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,736
"Don't sit
on that rattlesnake, Bumpy!"

81
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,643
No.

82
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,813
"Don't drink water
from the creek, Bumpy"?

83
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,551
Not that.

84
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,621
Oh, you mean,
"" Good times or bad times,

85
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,555
we always look after each other.”

86
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,725
That's right.

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,052
Because we're all...

88
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,323
Family!

89
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,571
It's a simple task, Clem.

90
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,272
If you can't manage it...

91
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,585
Sorry, Mr. Critchley!

92
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,143
How many scarecrows so far?

93
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,091
Fifty-eight.

94
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,492
Thank you, Diablo.

95
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,936
Maybe I should pay Diablo to work for me

96
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,994
instead of you, Clem.

97
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,196
What do you think?

98
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,172
Sorry, Mr. Critchley.

99
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,211
I just don't get why we're planting
scarecrows way out here.

100
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,672
To scare the prairie dogs.

101
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,346
I hate prairie dogs.

102
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,344
But why do you want to scare 'em off
a bunch of land

103
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,955
you don't never use?

104
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,281
Diablo, help me out.

105
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,021
I own land

106
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:58,195
here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here and here.

107
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,032
I own everything.

108
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,638
Except for this.

109
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,337
Betty Benson's place.

110
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,412
Yes, Betty Benson's place.

111
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,882
I'm not going to scare
prairie dogs off my land.

112
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,180
I'm going to scare them onto her land!

113
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,912
She'll be ruined,

114
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,917
she'll have to sell to me.

115
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,050
And I'll be the most
powerful man in the state.

116
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,694
Beats the old days
of robbing banks, huh, boss?

117
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,699
Please!

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,868
I'm a businessman now.

119
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,001
I know.

120
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,233
And that's why I tore this down
as soon as I saw it.

121
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,063
It's the brother. Bentley.

122
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,733
The one who moved away?

123
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,472
They say he went to the city

124
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,565
and made a fortune with the railroad!

125
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,042
Bentley, you've come home!

126
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,147
Hello, sis.

127
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,915
- "Sis"?
- You mean...

128
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,315
We have a brother!

129
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,949
Well, look at Mr. Railroad Tycoon!

130
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,804
We knew you'd come back
and save the old Double UB!

131
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:41,737
Oh, well, no...

132
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,138
How rich are you exactly?

133
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,472
- If I could just...
- Gonna buy us a new barn, I bet.

134
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,637
- What I'm trying to...
- Is this all you have brought?

135
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,680
- I'm not...
- Gee,

136
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,779
I thought you'd have a fancier rig!

137
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,648
Let me... You see, I...

138
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,251
I'm not a tycoon!

139
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,114
But, Bentley, your letters...

140
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,417
All those business deals
you told us about.

141
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,855
And your promotions.

142
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,188
I may have... exaggerated a few details.

143
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,195
Just a little.

144
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,927
I guess I wanted to impress you.

145
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,802
So, you're ea yin'
you're not the Chairman

146
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,535
of the Consolidated Intercontinental

147
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,804
Trans-American Locomotive
and Rail Consortium?

148
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,671
Not yet. But I am the Junior
Regional Assistant Associate trainee.

149
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,374
And I've got a bright future
ahead of me!

150
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,449
As what?

151
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,845
As the Senior Regional
Assistant Associate trainee.

152
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,964
I know it doesn't sound like much,

153
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,462
but I'm on my way up.

154
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,661
I figure if I helped you
fix up the ranch,

155
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,567
we could sell it.

156
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,469
Then, you and Betty can come
and live in the city with me!

157
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,518
Tell you what, Bent.

158
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,178
You help us fix the place up.

159
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,387
If I can't make it work, we'll sell.

160
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,489
But if I can,

161
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,525
we keep the ranch
and split the profits. Deal?

162
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,652
Oh, deal.

163
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,364
If we all pull together,
in a month or two,

164
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,559
we'll be ready to drive
the herd to Abilene!

165
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,196
Uh, you want me to go
on a cattle drive? Me?

166
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,906
Ah, just a short one...
614 miles is all.

167
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,406
Unless you get caught in a stampede,

168
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,704
or washed away in a flood.

169
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,507
Come on inside, Bentley.

170
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,603
Let's get you something to eat.

171
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,039
Then we'll talk business.

172
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,222
What are we waiting for, Uncle Jerry?

173
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,358
Let's go introduce ourselves.

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,099
Wait a minute.

175
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,191
Where are the...

176
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,064
I was saying, where...

177
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,271
are...

178
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,368
the little fellas!
Where are the little fellas?

179
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,789
Dig in!

180
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,088
Why thank you!

181
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,786
Boys, where are your manners?

182
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,829
We have guests!

183
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,961
Rodents!

184
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,939
What's wrong?

185
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,983
Did you sit on a rattlesnake?

186
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,361
Moo-so-what-eya?

187
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,794
Musophobia.

188
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,759
A fear of mice.

189
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,495
Or shews. Or ferrets,

190
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,095
hamsters, hedgehogs, squirrels,
chipmunks, gerbils, muskrats...

191
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,162
Betty!

192
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,365
- Sorry.
- Which is why

193
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,943
I go nowhere without my trusty Tom.

194
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,305
He's tough as they come.

195
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,353
Oh, sure, I could see that plain as day.

196
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,514
Hmm, and I can see that my first task

197
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,686
is to rid the ranch
of this horrible mouse infestation.

198
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,193
"Mouse infestation"?

199
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,189
You mean that? In there?

200
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,366
You can stop worrying, Betty.

201
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,898
City cats fight giant rats just for fun!

202
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,535
Once Tom's on the job,

203
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,039
your little mice don't stand a chance.

204
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,025
That smell? It's...

205
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,226
Very familiar, isn't it?

206
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,093
Let me think. Oh, I know.

207
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,438
Breakfast!

208
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,408
Yah!

209
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,853
Don't worry, he's perfectly tame!

210
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,434
Maybe not that tame.

211
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,034
Show him who's boss!

212
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,403
Uh, reward him with a treat!

213
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,241
Hit him with a rolled up newspaper!

214
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,175
Dress him up
in a darling little outfit!

215
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,277
It's nice to see them
playing together.

216
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,753
Aw!

217
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,865
This might be a good time to address

218
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,598
the commonly held belief
that bulls hate the color red.

219
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,106
Actually, they're indifferent to colors.

220
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,570
That's certainly news to me.

221
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,908
No, bulls don't hate red capes.
They hate moving capes.

222
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,557
Why is he thanking us?

223
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,460
He's just a little over-excited.

224
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,266
How many fingers do I have up?

225
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,966
What day is it today?

226
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,499
I don't think he understands about us.

227
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,064
Let me explain.

228
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,306
You came here with Bentley.

229
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,775
We live here with Betty!

230
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,770
Betty is Bentley's sister.
So that means that...

231
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,475
You are our brother!

232
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,678
Who's president of the United States?

233
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,911
What's your mother's maiden name?

234
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,649
Uh... get some ice on that!

235
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,584
I'm your brother, Tuffy.

236
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,523
This is your brother, Scruffy.
Your brother, Duffy.

237
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,320
And this is Uncle Jerry.

238
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,024
And from now on, we're the guys
who are gonna make you look

239
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,261
like a hero in front of Bentley!

240
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,827
You're going to be the best mouse hunter
in the West!

241
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,632
- Cunning!
- Ruthless!

242
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,964
Well-behaved!

243
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,537
We're all gonna pretend, see?

244
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,821
We're gonna make it look like
you solved

245
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,214
the
"horrible mouse infestation."

246
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,221
And you are going to make sure
your brothers stay safe.

247
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,225
Got it?

248
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,232
<i>Lots of fetters out there,
they want to be cowboys</i>

249
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,572
<i>From the Pecos on up to Illinois</i>

250
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,511
<i>Have to dust off all that city</i>

251
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,510
<i>Get to the nitty gritty</i>

252
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,572
<i>So all you little pups
Cowboy up!</i>

253
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,379
<i>- You gotta cowboy up
- Yee haw!</i>

254
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,987
<i>- Do what the cowboys do
- Yippee yi yo</i>

255
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,080
- You need a big hat
- Whoop whoo

256
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,090
<i>- And a good horse too
- Giddy up, giddy up</i>

257
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,092
<i>- You gotta ride that trail
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

258
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,424
<i>- You gotta buck that bail
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

259
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,191
<i>You gotta cowboy up</i>

260
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,822
<i>Gotta cowboy, gotta cowboy!</i>

261
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:45,203
<i>Now don't forget your saddle
and matches for the campfire</i>

262
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,605
<i>Some beans and bacon
And a rope are all required</i>

263
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,542
<i>A tin you need to pan for gold</i>

264
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,845
<i>A bed that you can fold</i>

265
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,911
<i>Some saddle bags a dusty rag</i>

266
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,922
<i>A deck of cards a pound of lard</i>

267
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,924
<i>Some silver spurs</i>

268
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,296
Whoa! Hold on there, little doggies.

269
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,926
Now, where was I?

270
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,864
<i>- You gotta cowboy up
- Yee haw!</i>

271
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,767
<i>- Like the cowboys do
- Yippee yi yo</i>

272
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,903
<i>- You need a big belt buckle
- Whoop whoo</i>

273
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,269
<i>- And spurs to boot
- Giddy up, giddy up</i>

274
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,566
<i>- You gotta wear them boots
- Yippee yi yo</i>

275
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,642
<i>- Need a gun that shoots
- Yippee yi yo</i>

276
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,804
<i>- You gotta look that part
- Whoop whoo</i>

277
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,143
<i>You gotta cowboy up</i>

278
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,640
Come on now!

279
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,434
<i>We've saved the ranch</i>

280
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,734
<i>Mended the fence</i>

281
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,833
<i>Plowed the fields</i>

282
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,435
<i>Used good horse sense</i>

283
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,839
<i>So here's to John Wayne and Gary Cooper</i>

284
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,980
<i>And to the cowboys of the future</i>

285
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,512
<i>So take your guitar
and strum them strings</i>

286
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,351
<i>'Cause this is what the cowboy sings</i>

287
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,519
<i>- You gotta cowboy up
- Yee haw!</i>

288
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,687
<i>- Like the cowboys do
- Yippee yi yo</i>

289
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,596
<i>- You need a big bandana
- Whoop whoo</i>

290
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,492
<i>And a gold spittoon</i>

291
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,263
<i>- You gotta rope that steer
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

292
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,702
<i>- You gotta have no fear
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

293
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,536
<i>The work don't stop</i>

294
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,165
<i>You gotta cowboy up</i>

295
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,810
<i>- You gotta rope that steer
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

296
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,205
<i>- You gotta have no fear
- Yippee yi yippee yay</i>

297
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,788
<i>The work don't stop</i>

298
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,315
Back down in that hole, boys.

299
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,153
<i>You gotta cowboy up</i>

300
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,497
- Howdy, Loretta.
- Howdy, Duke.

301
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,535
Well, will you listen to that.

302
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,413
Oh, it's just baby talk.

303
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,176
Oh, you mark my words.

304
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,718
That little feller's gonna be
yippin' in no time.

305
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,558
Well, how bad is it?

306
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,922
Bad, Duke.

307
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,927
And I've planned prairie dog towns
all over the West.

308
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,434
We've got predators threatening
from the North, the East, and the South.

309
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,236
Look at 'em, out there.
Horrible things.

310
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,206
I spied one once before,
in a cornfield in Kansas.

311
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,177
Oh, uh, me too.

312
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,908
Seen one amongst some string beans
near the city of Ogallala.

313
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,547
Oh, I've seen 'em too.

314
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,219
- But this is different.
- How's that, Jane?

315
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,081
- They're organized.
- Sheriff,

316
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,920
I reckon you're the wisest,
bravest, most cool-headed of us all.

317
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,785
What do you think we ought to do?

318
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,521
Big Tim, George, Zeb!

319
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,192
You three run out there
and see what they want. Go!

320
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,399
Us?

321
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,794
What about you?

322
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,368
Okay, I'm going to be
honest with you.

323
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,068
It don't look good.

324
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,405
Sheriff's run off.

325
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,975
And there's something going on
that I don't understand.

326
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,782
But what I do know is this...

327
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,653
We're prairie dogs. And prairie dogs
look out for each other.

328
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,753
Ain't that so?

329
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,324
Yip. Yip. That's right, Duke.

330
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,254
Every one of you here's got a family.

331
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,553
And those families, they need mounds,

332
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,257
holes and burrows
to live in and stay safe.

333
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,934
Zeb, how many you got
in your family now?

334
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,263
Well, golly, let me think.

335
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,598
Well, there's Mom, Dad,
Granny, of course.

336
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,674
Karen and Mike and their kids.

337
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,178
So, uh, let's see...

338
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,680
Oh, 26,245.

339
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,009
And 172 more due in April.

340
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,918
And not all of us has got
a small family like Zeb.

341
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,353
We need room
for our great town to grow.

342
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,460
- What's your plan, Duke?
- My plan?

343
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,587
If we can't go that way,

344
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,925
then we go that way.

345
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,459
You heard Duke. Those tunnels
aren't gonna dig themselves, boys.

346
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,271
Let's burrow.

347
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,475
You don't get
sunsets like this back in the city.

348
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,780
Uh, nope. I kind of forgot
how beautiful they are.

349
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,210
Just think, Bentley.

350
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,785
A month ago, you were ready
to sell this place.

351
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,685
Well, a month ago,
I never would've believed

352
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,486
the Double UB could
look this good again.

353
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,893
Almost like back when we were kids.
With Gramps.

354
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,823
Ooh, your Grandpa loved this ranch.

355
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,959
He got offers on it
over the years, you know.

356
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,400
Always turned them down, though.

357
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,062
Said it was meant for you two.

358
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,663
A place for you two
raise your own families.

359
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:33,857
Tom!

360
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,095
Will you look at that.

361
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,067
- That reminds me of the fireworks!
- The fireworks!

362
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,463
- Every holiday.
- Every birthday.

363
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,439
And don't forget cattle drives,

364
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,007
starting and finishing.

365
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,905
Gramps always set off fireworks

366
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,605
and fired the cannon to celebrate.

367
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,439
"Gotta get things started
with a bang," he always said.

368
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,481
Let's do it!

369
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,982
Hey, slow down.

370
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,018
Slow down.

371
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,348
Our work's not done yet.

372
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,588
There's 200 head of cattle over there.

373
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,656
They're going to bring in enough money
to keep the Double UB going.

374
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,851
But we've got to get them
to market first.

375
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:44,860
You're right.

376
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,522
Work now, celebrate later.

377
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,591
Now, hold on.

378
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,929
Didn't I just say your Grandpa
set off fireworks

379
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,300
before and after every cattle drive?

380
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,274
Well, this is before,
but only one.

381
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,976
Bentley and me are gonna be up
early tomorrow morning.

382
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,303
- Uh, we are?
- Yes.

383
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,108
Before I ride with a city feller
on a cattle drive,

384
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,175
I wanna make good and sure
he knows his way around a horse.

385
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,186
This one's called Stomper.

386
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,694
He's going to be your horse.

387
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,936
- Stomper?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,671
We got ourselves a long ride to Abilene.

389
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,174
And I wanna make sure
you've got a horse

390
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,436
that won't give any trouble.

391
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,772
- But... Stomper?
- Give him a carrot.

392
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,377
He loves carrots.

393
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,949
Oh, what about that one?

394
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,955
Clementine?

395
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,056
Hah!

396
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,587
Uh, no, you don't want to
ride Clementine.

397
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,091
I do. I do want to ride Clementine.

398
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,133
Look here, son. I...

399
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,358
No more talking about it.

400
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,561
I've made my decision.

401
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,142
Sure you still remember
how to ride, city boy?

402
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,902
If you want, I can still
get Stomper for you.

403
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,275
Oh, go ahead, you two.
Joke all you want.

404
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,146
But Clementine and me
are gonna get along just fine.

405
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,990
Well, then, I've got
one piece of advice. Whatever you do...

406
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:54,991
Come on, girl.

407
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,157
Don't call her "girl."

408
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,755
Don't let go, Bentley.

409
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,228
Oh, you think?

410
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,241
You try to be helpful, but some folks
just don't want to listen.

411
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,083
Once that cat gets hold of something,
he does not let go.

412
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,861
Sound the alarm.

413
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,930
Yip. Yip. Yip.

414
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,267
Bentley, are you all right?

415
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,606
- Is Tom all right?
- Yes.

416
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,672
Yes. I was just, uh, testing
my finally-honed equestrian skills

417
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,976
to, um, see what the horse had in her.

418
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,376
We're... we're fine, right, Tom?

419
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,452
Lovely ride.

420
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,785
Rodents!

421
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,998
Mice, Tom. Mice.

422
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,862
And all this time, I thought
you had the problem under control.

423
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:14,704
But, no. While you slept,
they invaded. Dangerous packs of mice,

424
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,830
digging holes,
living right beneath our feet.

425
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,669
I'm telling you, Bent,
those weren't mice.

426
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,576
They were just
some prairie dogs, is all.

427
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,338
Oh, Bentley's afraid of those too.

428
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,574
Also rats, shrews, ferrets,
hamsters, hedgehogs, squirrels,

429
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,880
- chipmunks, gerbils, muskrats...
- Betty!

430
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,915
Sorry, I always do that.

431
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,522
Come on, boys.

432
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,081
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

433
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,525
Hello?

434
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,664
Hello?

435
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,224
Hello?

436
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,901
Yip?

437
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,712
- Yip.
- Yip. Yip Yip.

438
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,254
Shout if you need help, Uncle Jerry.

439
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:11,961
Whoa.

440
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,131
Uh-oh.

441
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,857
We've got to get him out of there.

442
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,800
- Uncle Jerry?
- Follow the sound of my voice.

443
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,410
Oh, when this is over,
we're gonna do better, Uncle Jerry.

444
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,240
Yeah. No more sleeping in.
We'll be up before sunrise.

445
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,239
We'll do all the chores.

446
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,614
We're going to make
something of ourselves.

447
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,081
Uncle Jerry, you're okay.

448
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,085
Bentley, is this really necessary?

449
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,989
Hah! You weren't
down in that pit, Betty.

450
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,426
You didn't see those creatures.

451
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,796
- I'm sure it was very unpleasant, but...
- They have glowing red eyes.

452
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,459
Teeth like razors.

453
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,559
Don't you think you're overreacting?

454
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,896
Just a little?

455
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,300
A teensy-weensy bit?

456
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,466
Overreacting, huh?

457
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,510
I've read firsthand accounts of settlers

458
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,272
who were attacked
by crazed grizzly bears.

459
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,974
Pursued by wolves across frozen lakes.
Hunted down by wildcats.

460
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,084
- This was worse.
- Of course.

461
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,979
Why would I ever think
you were overreacting?

462
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,147
I was lucky to survive it.
That's all I'm saying.

463
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,819
I'll ask Bumpy
to ride into town tomorrow

464
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,920
and have the newspaper run this
in their next edition.

465
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,833
What the...

466
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,530
I'm here to see the boss.

467
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,177
Well, no, I don't have an appointment.

468
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,691
Hah! Think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

469
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,792
Two plus two equals four.

470
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,735
Big deal.

471
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,865
Three plus nine?

472
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,707
Easy, 12.

473
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,248
Wait, 14 times 23? Uh... Okay.

474
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,144
Hold on, now. Don't tell me.

475
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,915
I was gonna say 322,
if you'd ever give me a chance.

476
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,150
Stupid horse.

477
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,225
What is it, Clem?

478
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,884
The Bensons' hired hand

479
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,261
dropped this off at the newspaper office
this morning, boss.

480
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,534
It's an advertisement.

481
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,538
Yes, Clem, I can see that.

482
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,898
Look, would you mind
standing a little...

483
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,508
Sure, boss.

484
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:43,375
Maybe just a little... One more.

485
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,041
Just a little farther.

486
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,342
Almost.

487
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,007
Keep going. Keep going.

488
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,244
Nearly there.

489
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,786
How's this, boss?

490
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,788
Perfect. Now, about this advertisement.

491
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,759
"Motivated, aggressive cats wanted
for immediate work at the Benson Ranch.

492
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,094
Must hate mice.

493
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,565
Direct inquiries to Bentley Benson."

494
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,904
You know what this means?

495
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,602
- Clem!
- Oh, sorry, boss.

496
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,267
No. What does it mean?

497
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,908
It means my scheme
to drive those prairie dogs

498
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,709
onto the Benson property worked.

499
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,481
Nobody grabs land unscrupulously
better than you, Mr. Critchley.

500
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,613
"Unscrupulous" oughta be
your middle name.

501
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,917
It's nice of you to say that, Clem.

502
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,987
You may come back in now.

503
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:35,264
- What's our plan?
- Plan? We deliver the final blow.

504
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,734
I want you to go to the Benson place,

505
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,964
find the deed to the ranch
and destroy it.

506
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,603
I'll produce this phony deed,
claim that the land is mine,

507
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,167
and have Betty Benson
and her brother kicked off it for good.

508
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,774
With all due respect, Mr. Critchley,
there's no way those folks

509
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,409
are gonna let me anywheres
near their place.

510
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,480
Oh, they will. In fact,
they'll welcome you with open arms.

511
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:05,262
Now, I want you to round up
the meanest, nastiest,

512
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,959
most mouse-hating cats you can find.

513
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,503
I heard, you have
a rodent infestation problem.

514
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,802
No rodent escapes the terrible fate
these here cats deliver.

515
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,684
This one here is Butch.

516
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,515
Here's the brains of the outfit.

517
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,624
Uh, no, wait.
This ones the brains. Meathead.

518
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,130
Wait.

519
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,301
Maybe none of 'em is the brains.

520
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,233
Hold on.

521
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:46,868
Okay. Yeah.

522
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,536
This one's Lightnin',
because he's faster than lightning.

523
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,371
I think, 99% sure.

524
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,412
Don't quote me on it, though.

525
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:00,644
You get the idea. Butch,
Lightnin', Meathead and Shorty.

526
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,717
They're gonna take care
of your mouse problem.

527
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,246
They weren't mice.

528
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,381
They were just some
little prairie dogs, is all.

529
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,320
I hate prairie dogs.

530
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,435
So, Butch and Meathead.

531
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,097
Yeah. They look tough, all right.

532
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,904
They are. They used to hunt,
uh, b... buffaloes.

533
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,373
Yeah, full-sized buffaloes,
out on the plains.

534
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,081
Oh, you don't say.

535
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,573
Here we go.

536
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,547
And... and Lightnin'?
You said he's quick?

537
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,678
Is he quick? Watch.

538
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,182
Lightnin', get the mouse.

539
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,791
Huh! Did you see that?

540
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,521
He got one already.

541
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,397
Where?

542
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:51,524
Oh, he left it out on the field,
so it wouldn't upset the lady.

543
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,733
Aww, and you must be Shorty.

544
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,534
Bentley, please.

545
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,875
This is too much.

546
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,471
My sister is right.

547
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,583
You don't get as far as I have
in the cut-throat world of the railroads

548
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,883
without developing
a keen eye for people.

549
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,086
And I can tell you're
a trustworthy sort, Mr., uh...

550
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,254
- What did you say your name was?
- Me?

551
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,428
My name, uh, is, uh...

552
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:22,964
Sunflower.

553
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,262
Mule... y... toad.

554
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,769
Sunflower Muleytoad.

555
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,271
It's Dutch. And Scottish.

556
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,644
Well, then, Sunflower,
you're a trustworthy man,

557
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,644
I can see that.

558
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,249
But I need to know
that your cats can do this job.

559
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,610
So, I've set up a little test.

560
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,653
Here's how it works.

561
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,618
I will set loose these mice.

562
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,821
Mr. Muleytoad's cats will pursue them
around the obstacles.

563
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,958
If any mouse is able
to reach the cheese,

564
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,960
then I'm afraid,
there's no deal.

565
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,196
Fair enough.

566
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,197
On your marks.

567
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,299
Get set!

568
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,498
Go!

569
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,128
Butch, Meathead. Go get 'em.

570
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,039
Shorty, you're up.

571
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,432
Wow. Did you see that?
These cats are the real thing.

572
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,593
It's not over yet, Bentley. Look.

573
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,599
Lightnin', let's finish this.

574
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,810
You're hired. You can bunk out
in the barn and start tomorrow.

575
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:35,645
They should have never
fooled with us. Right, uncle Jerry?

576
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,545
Got you.

577
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,381
There's your culprits, Mr. Benson.

578
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,386
Oh, they look vicious.

579
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,824
Oh, they are. Probably rabid too.

580
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,154
Really?

581
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,993
Bentley, they're just mice.
Harmless mice.

582
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,297
Begging your pardon, ma'am,
but I've seen so-called

583
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,900
"harmless critters"
just like these here,

584
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,173
lay whole towns to waste.

585
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:13,508
Ever heard of the bustling metropolis
of Grand Mesa, Oklahoma?

586
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,848
- No, I can't say that I have.
- My point exactly.

587
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,119
Well, then, thank goodness
you showed up here to help us out.

588
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,483
Tell me what we owe you
and you can be on your way.

589
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,825
Oh, I can't take your money,

590
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,861
because the job ain't done.

591
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:34,030
- It's not?
- No, sir. For every mouse you see,

592
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:38,200
there's two or three thousand
more hiding all around you.

593
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,103
That's where they got the expression,

594
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,474
"the tip of the miceberg."

595
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:46,277
Me and the cats, we got
lots more work to do here.

596
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:50,980
Hmm. We'll be on the trail for weeks,
getting the cattle dabbling, Betty.

597
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,545
We could have Sunflower stay here

598
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,522
and keep an eye on the ranch
while we're gone.

599
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,791
Who?

600
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,826
Oh, I mean, sure. I'm your man.

601
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,359
I'll go take care of these ones.

602
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,164
Uh, what do you mean,
"take care of them"?

603
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,702
Absolutely not!

604
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,704
What came over you in the city, Bentley?

605
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,998
Don't you remember what
Gramps always told us?

606
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,377
Out here, there's room enough
for everyone to find a home.

607
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,745
I'll take them far away from the ranch.

608
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,880
But we're letting them go.

609
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,182
I packed up a few things.

610
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,351
Your tools, some clothes,

611
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,254
and biscuits, of course.

612
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,388
I'm so sorry, boys.

613
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,890
My brother...

614
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,360
Well, he'll come around.

615
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,363
I know it.

616
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,593
In the meantime,
just stay close and stay safe.

617
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,897
If you get into trouble, you make
for one of them prairie dog holes.

618
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,268
Ain't no place safer.

619
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,670
We'll get you back home. I promise.

620
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,350
I'd sing you all some cowboy
songs if I had a guitar,

621
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,888
and I knew how to play.

622
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,884
- Or sing.
- What cowboy songs do you know?

623
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,753
Okay, if I knew any cowboy songs,
then I would sing them.

624
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,090
You know, it's almost as entertaining,
just hearing you explain.

625
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,269
What was that?

626
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,325
Run!

627
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:42,996
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

628
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,123
We're perfectly safe.

629
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,930
There's no way that thing can hurt us,
with that cage on his head.

630
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:47,971
You're right.

631
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,105
Look at you.

632
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,105
You're feeling pretty embarrassed
right now, aren't ya?

633
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,191
Settle down, everybody. Settle down.

634
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,001
After many hours of studying
the mysterious object

635
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,595
before you, we have discovered...

636
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,205
it is food!

637
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,169
Mm. It's got a metallic flavor to it.

638
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,815
Most likely it's an acquired taste.

639
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,851
That... The food is on the inside.

640
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,382
By golly, where's your common sense?

641
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,826
The problem is, how do
we open the durned thing?

642
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,388
Let Big Tim do it.

643
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,882
Intruders!

644
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,081
Who are you?
What are you doing down here?

645
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,566
It's... good!

646
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,771
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

647
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,275
This here's my wife,

648
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,211
and this is my daughter.

649
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,344
Well, hello!

650
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,184
Hey, y'all!

651
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,519
Is everybody having a good time?

652
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,546
Yip, yip, yip...

653
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,187
Well, we got these fellers

654
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,089
to thank for that.

655
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,959
Now, let's talk about our town,
the place we call home.

656
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,290
It's always been a peaceful place,

657
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,630
but lately,
we've been missing something...

658
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,592
A proper sheriff.

659
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,808
Well, tonight, I think we found one!

660
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,968
- I call for a vote!
- I second the motion.

661
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,110
All right, then.

662
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,281
All those in favor of making this here

663
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,974
friend of the prairie dog community

664
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,915
our new sheriff, say yeah!

665
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,248
Yip! Yip!

666
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,621
Opposed?

667
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,046
Yip.

668
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,253
The "yips" have it.

669
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,761
We got ourselves a new sheriff!

670
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,894
Welcome to your new home.

671
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,992
<i>Hey there, friend</i>

672
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,594
<i>Won't you come in?</i>

673
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,171
<i>Don't you know I like your style?</i>

674
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,069
<i>You're family now</i>

675
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,072
<i>Welcome to our underground</i>

676
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,771
<i>To our underground</i>

677
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,118
<i>Take off your boots
Make yourself at home</i>

678
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,684
<i>Our house is your house too</i>

679
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,288
<i>What's mine is yours</i>

680
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,361
<i>And now we open up our doors</i>

681
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,126
<i>Pack up your bags</i>

682
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,995
<i>Don't make a fuss</i>

683
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,467
<i>Follow us down here</i>

684
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,697
<i>You're moving in with us</i>

685
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,636
<i>You're moving in with us</i>

686
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,877
<i>Walked into town
Straight out of the blue</i>

687
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,612
<i>Welcome to the team</i>

688
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,553
<i>We're glad we found friends like you</i>

689
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,354
<i>We got a lotta work to do</i>

690
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,824
<i>Pack up your bags
Don't make a fuss</i>

691
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,529
<i>And follow us down here</i>

692
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,534
<i>Your moving in with us</i>

693
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,507
<i>Your moving in with us</i>

694
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,310
<i>We'll get new curtains
A new chandelier</i>

695
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,371
<i>Won't take no time
It's a new frontier</i>

696
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,075
<i>Your search has ended
Come stake your claim</i>

697
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,878
<i>It's ranch house envy
Calling your name</i>

698
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,851
<i>So grab your duds
No time to squander</i>

699
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,547
<i>It's cozy darn tootin'
A way down yonder</i>

700
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,190
<i>One short step from up above</i>

701
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,893
<i>Warm hearts and hands
You'll feel the love</i>

702
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,489
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

703
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,893
<i>Where the mice
and the prairie dogs play</i>

704
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:14,065
<i>So pack up your bags
Don't make a fuss</i>

705
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,163
<i>And join the family here</i>

706
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:22,870
<i>You're moving in with us
You're moving in with us</i>

707
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,615
I feel good knowing
that while we're on the cattle drive,

708
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,556
we're leaving the Double UB
under the watchful eye of Mr. Muleytoad.

709
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:38,560
Who?

710
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,127
Oh, yes, sir.

711
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,231
You folks go sell your cattle.

712
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,562
I promise, when you get back,
you won't have a ranch

713
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,262
to worry about no more.

714
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,371
Pardon me?

715
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:52,306
That is, you won't have to
worry about the ranch no more.

716
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,811
Well, then, we've got a long,
rough trail ahead of us.

717
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,874
But I reckon we're about
as ready as we'll ever be.

718
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,381
Let's get these critters to Abilene!

719
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,994
Did anybody let the cows
out of the corral?

720
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,728
Ah. Wait here.

721
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,642
Well, that was weird.

722
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,643
Let's find that deed.

723
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,766
Hold on, everybody.

724
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,030
Tom found it.

725
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,764
This is a letter from great aunt Millie.

726
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,438
This is a shopping list.

727
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,168
Bill for lumber, bills,

728
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,843
letter from Uncle Steve...

729
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,676
That's enough! Boys, throw him out!

730
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,621
Gotcha!

731
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:20,824
Ow!

732
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,503
Oh! No deed.

733
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,214
I can't understand it.

734
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,849
Not like a jackalope came in here
and took it or something.

735
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:46,750
Don't tell me.
You never heard of a jackalope?

736
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,223
No one knows where it came from,

737
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,022
and few who've seen it
have lived to tell the tale.

738
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,162
It takes the form of a jackrabbit.

739
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,257
This tall,

740
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,359
with antelope horns
and rattlesnake teeth.

741
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,999
And they say that
on nights like these,

742
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,767
when the moon is full,

743
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,738
the jackalope appears,

744
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,338
moving across the prairie
with a single purpose,

745
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,916
to hunt down its favorite prey...

746
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,549
Cats!

747
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,791
It's a harmless prairie chicken,
I tell you. Look!

748
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,959
- Here's his beak.
- Now, son, that ain't a beak.

749
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,297
It's fangs.

750
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,904
This fella's a sidewinder.

751
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,337
Whoever heard of a snake with arms?

752
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,570
Well, whoever heard
of a chicken with teeth?

753
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,236
Pa, Curly, stop your bickering.

754
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,009
The sheriff will know
what to do with him.

755
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,640
Good thinking, hon.

756
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,357
Sheriff, we got something here

757
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,025
you and the deputies ought to see.

758
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,636
It's a sidewinder.

759
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,329
It's a prairie chicken.

760
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,305
It's our brother!

761
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,810
Why aren't you back at the ranch?

762
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,644
Are Betty and Bentley with you?

763
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,144
What happened?

764
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,122
Muleytoad's up to
something bad, Uncle Jerry.

765
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:06,127
Oh, yeah. Just wait till
Betty and Bentley and Bumpy get back.

766
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,186
Then he'll be sorry.

767
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,354
That'll be too late.

768
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,190
Our family needs us now!

769
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,144
But what can we do?

770
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,077
Those cats are stronger than us.

771
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,676
Faster than us.

772
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,243
Meaner than us.

773
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,085
We need a plan.

774
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,216
There you are.

775
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,056
She's a-looking for you, you know.

776
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,321
Who is, old timer?

777
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,092
Well, old Sally and me,

778
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,326
we was diggin' over yonder that way.

779
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,595
And I says to Sally,

780
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:48,763
"Sally, maybe we should ought
to dig over that way

781
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:52,103
and see what we find there."

782
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:57,404
Yeah, course, when I was a young man,
I didn't dig so much as I do now.

783
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,373
Back then, yeah,
me and my wife, Ethel,

784
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,680
we had us a little burrow outside of it.

785
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,186
Wait. Who is?

786
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,381
- Who's what?
- Looking for us.

787
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,187
She is.

788
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,733
Boys, I think we just got our plan.

789
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,142
Hmm. It's almost right.

790
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,550
- The ears aren't long enough.
- Need sharper teeth.

791
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,818
More antlers, I'm telling you.
More antlers.

792
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,156
Ah. Not bad.

793
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,266
One piece of paper, Clem.

794
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,432
That's all you had to do.

795
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,804
Find one piece of paper!

796
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,615
Yeah, but the deed
just ain't there, boss.

797
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:10,079
Maybe you should just, you know... Uh...

798
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,779
Pardon me?

799
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,290
- Nothing.
- No, Clem. Tell me.

800
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,425
Maybe I should just...

801
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,759
Uh...

802
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,818
Buy the ranch from them.

803
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,528
Buy it? Buy it?

804
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,296
I tried to buy it
from their grandfather.

805
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,198
He turned down every offer.

806
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,669
He said no amount
of money was enough.

807
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,036
Do you know why?

808
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,870
He said it was their...

809
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,674
home.

810
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,270
He turned down money.

811
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,010
What kind of a man does that?

812
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,145
Now get back out there

813
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,553
and find that deed!

814
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,418
There's something
strange going on here.

815
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,692
Who would have guessed
that a cat dressed

816
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,353
as a jackalope wouldn't work?

817
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,996
It was just one battle.

818
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,394
We'll figure out a way.

819
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,756
Uncle Jerry's right.

820
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,401
We need reinforcements.

821
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,501
Well, if we didn't have those
predators to deal with...

822
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,570
We'd be right there with you.

823
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,038
Boys, we've got work to do.

824
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,341
Oh, Betty and Bentley are gonna be
pretty surprised when they get home.

825
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:51,919
<i>Ah!</i>

826
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,749
<i>Did anybody remember
to get our money for the</i> carro?

827
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,792
<i>Wait here.
I'll be right back.</i>

828
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,593
<i>Okay, then, let's go home.</i>

829
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:16,142
I tried. I really did.
You know that, right?

830
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,040
But the boss don't care about that,
or about me, or you.

831
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:26,112
All he cares about is more land.
More, more, more!

832
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,255
You guys are the best. Really.

833
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:33,318
I know I don't say it
near enough, but you are.

834
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,425
You know what?
I'm going to make us a nice dinner.

835
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,160
Where did those recipes get to?

836
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:45,500
Let me see. "Biscuits, biscuits,
another biscuits."

837
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,633
I've never seen so many biscuit recipes.

838
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,906
"Rhubarb pie, meat loaf,

839
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,641
deed to the ranch,
pineapple jardiniere..."

840
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,815
Deed to the ranch!

841
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,154
- Yip.
- Nice work. Next.

842
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:00,819
- Yip.
- That's right.

843
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,823
Nothing to be afraid of. Next.

844
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,826
- Yip.
- So, they're not predators?

845
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,363
Nope. They use him to scare off crows.

846
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,126
Of course, they do.
Those things are terrifying.

847
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,793
That's what we're counting on.

848
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,960
What is it now?

849
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,337
Hah! It's scarecrows.

850
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,344
The boss and I put 'em out there
to scare the prairie dog...

851
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,338
Wait a second. I could have sworn...

852
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,877
Number three and number 14, move!

853
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,116
Numbers two, five, 11, and 22, move!

854
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,562
We just need to stay calm.

855
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,132
There's no way they can get us in here.

856
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,698
We're under attack!

857
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:58,881
Predators!

858
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:01,310
They got Frank!

859
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,816
I owe you.

860
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,847
They don't know what hit 'em.
You did it. The ranch is saved.

861
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,555
Retreat! Retreat!

862
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,551
Wait! The deed!

863
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,635
Take that, you varmint!

864
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:58,799
- Whoo-hoo! We showed 'em!
- We sure did.

865
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,947
Sunflower Muleytoad.

866
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,124
Did anyone else think
that was an odd name?

867
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,900
Well, on the bright side,
you made a good profit on your carro.

868
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,435
Things could be a lot worse.

869
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,301
We can bunk out
in the barn for a while,

870
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,843
hire a few hands
to help us rebuild the house,

871
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,776
we'll be on our feet in no time.

872
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,110
You know, Betty, being out here
with you and Bumpy,

873
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,015
fixing up the old place,
thinking about Gramps,

874
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,815
it reminded me of something
that I almost forgot.

875
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:48,255
That "good times or bad times,
we always look out for each other"?

876
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,486
Because we're all family.

877
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,585
No. It reminded me why I left
for the city in the first place.

878
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,298
- What?
- Oh, nothing. You were saying?

879
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:04,095
This morning,
I realized I'm no rancher,

880
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,301
I'm a railroad man,
through and through.

881
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,039
The steel rails,
the clackety-clack of the, uh...

882
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,113
Wheels?

883
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,013
No, no, the other...
The... Oh, you know...

884
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,551
Ah, whatever. It's my destiny.

885
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,711
Okay. Come on, Tom. We have to pack.

886
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,186
We're leaving in the morning.

887
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,499
Please, Bent, don't leave.

888
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,698
The Double UB
should sell for a good price

889
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,167
once you clean things up, sis.

890
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,796
You can even keep the money.

891
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,239
I don't want the money.
I want you to stay.

892
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,536
We need you here.

893
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,337
Ah, you and Bumpy can manage.

894
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,205
Soon as you're ready, come to the city.

895
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,371
I'll have a room waiting for you.

896
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,196
Now, what?

897
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,909
There they are, Marshal.
I want them arrested immediately

898
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:22,952
- Arrested? For what?
- Squatting on my land.

899
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,249
It seems Mr. Critchley here has a deed
that says he owns this ranch.

900
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,760
Here it is, all legal and proper.

901
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,387
Critchley, you know darn well
this is the Bensons' land.

902
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,727
<i>You tried to buy it enough times
from their grandad.</i>

903
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,731
Is that true, August?

904
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,931
Poor man was convinced
he owned the entire state.

905
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,237
I offered a small sum to help relocate.
Charity, really.

906
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,808
- That's a lie!
- You skunk, you rattlesnake!

907
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,972
All right, everybody quiet!

908
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:59,544
Now, apologies, ma'am.
Probably just a little misunderstanding.

909
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,552
Well put, Diablo.

910
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,926
I said, quiet.
Now, Ms. Benson,

911
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,486
if you could just show me your deed,

912
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:11,259
Mr. Critchley and I will be on our way.

913
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:15,128
But there was a fire last night.
Everything is gone.

914
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,462
So, you have no deed.

915
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,099
They're trespassing, Marshal.
Take them away.

916
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,503
This is bad.

917
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,672
I have an idea.
We'll need a wheelbarrow, a cannon,

918
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,909
1,000 prairie dogs, one bull,

919
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,079
barbed wire, scarecrows,
a thingamabobber...

920
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,449
Marshal, please,
you're making a mistake.

921
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,514
I don't like it either,
but I've got no choice.

922
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,150
The law is the law.

923
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,629
- Critchley, I oughta...
- Did you hear that? He's threatening me.

924
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,797
Ma'am, I am sorry,

925
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,427
but unless you have evidence
to the contrary,

926
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,972
I have to accept Mr. Critchley's claim.

927
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:51,797
What's going on here, Marshal?

928
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,310
Bentley, I thought you were going home.

929
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,513
This is my home.

930
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,332
Need some help, Sheriff?

931
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,543
Yippee yi yip!

932
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,473
The Prairie Dog Express
rides again!

933
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,419
I'm going to build a whole town here.

934
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:42,820
Critchleyville. No, no. Critchopolis.

935
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,553
What about your dreams, Bentley?

936
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,526
You wanted to be a railroad tycoon.

937
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,423
I was a railroad tycoon.

938
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,829
A Junior Regional Assistant
Associate trainee railroad tycoon.

939
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,332
But it never made me as happy

940
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,839
as I've been back here
on the Double UB with my family.

941
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,736
Good to have you back, son.

942
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,339
If you could just
give us a few days, Marshal,

943
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,209
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

944
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,249
The law is the law, Mr. Benson.

945
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,581
And I've got to escort you
off the property right now.

946
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,559
Yippee yi yip, my friend.

947
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,614
Say what?

948
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,953
- Bentley, what's wrong?
- You should tie him up, Marshal.

949
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,597
Mr. Benson, is something
the matter with you?

950
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,834
No, I just thought
you might be interested in this.

951
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:12,773
"Wanted for bank robbery
and forgery." August Critchley.

952
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,349
- Forgery?
- Let me see that.

953
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,583
Aha! The signature
on this deed says

954
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,145
"Lloyd Benson."

955
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,419
But Granddad's name wasn't Lloyd Benson.

956
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,358
It was Boyd Benson.

957
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,361
What? They're lying, Marshal.

958
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,760
I should know.
I signed that deed myself.

959
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,802
- Oops.
- Got ya.

960
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:37,100
You're under arrest, Critchley.
You got anything to say?

961
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,840
Just this.
Ride, Diablo, ride!

962
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,497
Ha, I told you.

963
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:09,300
Once that cat gets hold of something,
he does not let go.

964
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,916
Gramps would be so proud.

965
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,476
It's going to be tough going
for a while, even with the reward money.

966
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,913
I know. But this is home.

967
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:34,189
Hey, let me get that for you, boys.

968
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,895
Going to have to
rebuild the house over that way.

969
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,770
This is all dug up under here.

970
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,569
I think you're right.

971
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,177
I don't know. It looks pretty solid to...

972
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,016
Prairie dogs.

973
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,518
Gold!
