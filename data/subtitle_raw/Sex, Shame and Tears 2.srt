1
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,915
She's here.

2
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,218
Welcome, doctor.

3
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,924
SEX, SHAME AND TEARS 2

4
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,746
Why did you take my...?

5
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,516
I already told you
not to touch my script, dad!

6
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,039
Can't you lock the door?

7
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,141
Can't you knock?

8
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,076
It's the third time this week.

9
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,878
It's the fifth.

10
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:52,879
Mom!

11
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,015
Ana...

12
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,453
Matilde, you're the one who came in.

13
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,854
I know, but...

14
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,923
Why do you take my things?

15
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,959
I just wanted
to read your play to support you.

16
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,694
It's poorly written, by the way.

17
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,863
I don't need your help
nor your comments, dad.

18
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,932
You should learn to lock the door.

19
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,767
You should learn to knock.

20
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,941
Hello.

21
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:22,942
Hello.

22
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,377
I'm looking for Ana.

23
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,878
I'm Ana.

24
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,415
I'm Mateo, Tomás' son.

25
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,256
- London?
- Yes.

26
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,725
- How old are you?
- I'm 27.

27
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,296
No. It's not possible.
The dates don't match.

28
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,730
Tomás was not there by then.

29
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,699
I think the same,
but look at his face.

30
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,868
It seems Tomás came in here
20 years later.

31
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,070
I don't understand
why he didn't tell us

32
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,872
about his 7-year-old "son."

33
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,674
My father didn't know.

34
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,443
Is that what you think?
I know that story.

35
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,644
My mother never told him.

36
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,246
Who's your mother?

37
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,647
My mother?

38
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,115
Yes. Where's she?

39
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,817
She's dead.

40
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,554
I'm sorry.

41
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,123
Is that why you're here?

42
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,659
- You're trying to find Tomás.
- No.

43
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,729
Because if you're trying
to find Tomás, there's a problem.

44
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,065
No, I'm not looking for my father.

45
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,433
So?

46
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,903
I have an exhibition
by the end of next week.

47
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,904
OK. So?

48
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,706
Are you a photographer?

49
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,974
I'm a visual artist.

50
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,542
What's your last name?

51
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,543
Nava.

52
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,980
Are you kidding?

53
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:34,981
- What?
- What?

54
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,650
I follow you?
You've got to be kidding.

55
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,151
Did you do this?

56
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,286
What is it?

57
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,288
He's got
around five million followers.

58
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,156
Ana, do you know him?

59
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,292
Are you Tomás' son?

60
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,561
Yes, my father was a friend
of your parents.

61
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,097
But my father killed himself.

62
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,099
What?

63
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,368
Yes. In the elevator
of this same building.

64
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,036
Right?

65
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,674
That's why
you don't use the elevator.

66
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,076
Who told you that?
How do you know it?

67
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,177
My uncle told me.

68
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,380
You never told me
Tomás killed himself here.

69
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,484
Maybe what your uncle told you
is not exactly... I mean...

70
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,752
Did you come to stay here?

71
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,088
If you need to stay here, it's OK.

72
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,457
You can stay as long as you want,
while you...

73
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,892
Ana! Please.

74
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,062
Mati, show him the guest room.

75
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,764
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

76
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,215
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you?

77
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,684
Carlos, please.

78
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,855
What's Ram Dass Sangh like in person?

79
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,856
Ram Dass Singh.

80
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,425
Ram Dass Singh.

81
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,060
- He's a good person.
- Really?

82
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,128
He likes my music.

83
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,764
He told me he studied in India.

84
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,333
Is he Mexican?

85
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,835
Yes, but he got enlightened.

86
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,139
In India?

87
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,575
Yes, that's what he told me.

88
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,779
What are you doing today?

89
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,348
I need to go to the doctor.

90
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,518
Remember we were going to borrow
some money from your mother.

91
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,555
Yes. She said yes.

92
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,623
Cool.

93
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,126
I'll pay her back after the retreat.

94
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,694
You'd better.

95
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,530
I love you.

96
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,366
Shut up.

97
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,506
<i>Mom!</i>

98
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,708
<i>Come in!</i>

99
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,713
Still in bed?

100
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,317
Look at the time.
Won't you be late?

101
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,119
- No, I can make it.
- No?

102
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,253
Good morning.

103
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,821
My sweetheart.

104
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,925
Listen, I need to borrow
the money I told you about.

105
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,695
- This girl.
- Come on!

106
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,465
- Hand me my purse.
- OK.

107
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,569
I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you back.

108
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,106
- Of course, you'll pay me back.
- Yes, of course.

109
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,241
When?

110
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,644
I don't doubt you'll pay me back,
I just want to know when.

111
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,881
In one month. Give me a month.
We agreed you'd give me a month.

112
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,716
Don't take this for granted.

113
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,086
Nobody's going to lend you money
and give you one month to pay it back.

114
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,756
- I just want you to know that.
- But you're my mom.

115
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,525
You brat.

116
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,494
I'll leave you alone.
I'll see you later.

117
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,263
Bye.

118
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,964
All right.

119
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,138
Jeez, I can't take this.

120
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,778
Did she notice?

121
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,088
- I get too nervous.
- Why?

122
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:06,459
You know why.
I don't want to keep sneaking around.

123
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,428
- Where are you going?
- To take a shower. Get dressed.

124
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,429
I'll join you.

125
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,076
Look at this.

126
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,246
It's Tomás.

127
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,415
Is it Tomás? They're identical.

128
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,887
Listen...

129
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,326
- So, Tomás killed himself here?
- No...

130
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,264
Yes.

131
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,770
What's he here for?

132
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,911
It's just that when I look
at his face...

133
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,781
I thought I had already overcome
Tomás' death.

134
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,022
Why did mom act like that?

135
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,260
Those were complicated times.

136
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,930
Tomás and she were very close.

137
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,901
Is that why she's got that temper?

138
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,936
No, she's always had that temper.

139
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,840
Listen. Go talk to him.

140
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,310
Yes. Try to find out why he's here.

141
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,146
Go.

142
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,691
For Christ's sake, Beny.

143
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,893
PEDIATRICIAN

144
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,262
Your two prescriptions.

145
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,064
Two prescriptions?

146
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes. One for you
and one for your girlfriend.

147
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,903
No, no. You've got to be kidding.
Why two prescriptions?

148
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,972
I don't need two prescriptions.

149
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,875
What am I going to tell her?

150
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,177
Off you go.

151
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,682
If I add some more thyme,
does it enhance its flavor?

152
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,319
- I don't think you should add any.
- OK.

153
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,854
Rigo, I need more eggs.

154
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,923
More eggs?

155
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,425
Yes, please.

156
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,328
All right.

157
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,566
He has been a bit whiny, hasn't he?

158
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,369
- Don't mention it.
- I think his boyfriend dumped him.

159
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,071
No, I mean it.

160
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,907
No, not in here. Not in here.

161
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,108
Why not?

162
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,577
This is not the place.
Someone might see us.

163
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,646
Andrea, if this is not
the place, where?

164
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,050
Because I'm tired
of hiding in the closet.

165
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,487
OK? What's the problem
if they know we love each other?

166
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,757
I don't know what to say.

167
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,727
Especially, if you tell me that here.

168
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,861
UNKNOWN NUMBER

169
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,229
I don't know who this is.

170
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,064
Then tell me, what do you think?

171
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,766
I don't know.

172
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,169
Back up, please.
It's not appropriate.

173
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,304
I don't know.

174
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,140
In this place...
Who's calling?

175
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,742
UNKNOWN NUMBER

176
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,143
Hello?

177
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,314
Good afternoon.
Yes, it's me.

178
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,521
How come?

179
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,557
But... María what?

180
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,626
It's almost a miracle.

181
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,530
She's got injuries
all over her body, but...

182
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,668
A sprain on her left knee,
a wound on her right shoulder.

183
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,636
But that's it.

184
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,673
From the fourth floor?

185
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,841
That's what the reports say.

186
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,844
What the hell was she thinking?

187
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,112
She was not thinking.

188
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,149
She needs to stay
under observation for a few days,

189
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,718
and receive psychiatric assessment.

190
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,889
- Don't leave her alone.
- No. Don't worry about it.

191
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,924
Thank you very much, doctor.

192
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,094
Excuse me.

193
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,702
You just showed up like that
without even calling.

194
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,040
You could have called first,
like normal people do,

195
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,644
and avoid making
this foolish entrance.

196
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,716
What the hell is going on?

197
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,318
María.

198
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,822
What are you doing?

199
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,899
Why don't you have an accent?

200
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,105
Because my mother was Mexican.

201
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,840
Are you kidding?

202
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,143
No.

203
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,348
Tomás traveled 5,544 miles
to sleep with a Mexican woman?

204
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,285
You should have seen
what a Mexican woman she was.

205
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:39,224
How do you know
he traveled 5,544 miles?

206
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm good at geography.

207
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,163
- Was she beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

208
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,934
Do you want to go out?

209
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,138
Katia!

210
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,877
Girl, what the hell?
I sent you like a hundred messages!

211
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,112
We received a little surprise.
Mateo.

212
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,481
Hello.

213
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,615
Hello.

214
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,852
Do you see this?
I thought no one was coming.

215
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,221
No one? Fatty's a freaking rock star

216
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,957
playing that shit
nobody knows how to pronounce.

217
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:45,958
Didgeridoo.

218
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,761
I'll go get a drink.
Do you want something?

219
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,763
- A beer.
- Same for me.

220
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,031
- OK.
- I'll go with you.

221
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,436
Who's the freak?

222
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,305
Mateo, Tomás' son.

223
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,140
Who's Tomás?

224
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,642
Tomás!

225
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,378
Did he have a son?

226
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,449
Yes. Tomás killed himself
in my building's elevator.

227
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,318
That's why your mother
doesn't use the elevator!

228
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,453
That's why!

229
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,454
- No way!
- Yes!

230
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,507
My dear, take it easy.

231
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,842
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,145
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,450
I don't know what happened to me.

234
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,488
I just got tired of everything.

235
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,325
I'm tired.

236
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,096
I'm tired of living.

237
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,633
I didn't think...

238
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,437
You don't have to speak.
You don't have to tell us anything.

239
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:12,244
Yes. I don't want more secrets.
We need to tell the truth.

240
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,579
María, listen to me.

241
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,615
You need to rest.

242
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,652
You need to sleep. All right?

243
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,689
We're here.

244
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,290
The three of us.

245
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,671
Hey, pretty boots.

246
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,343
Can you hold the door for me?
The lock is broken.

247
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,878
What are you doing in there?

248
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,581
What do you think I'm doing?

249
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,283
One of two things,

250
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,919
and I don't want to be in there
if you're taking a dump.

251
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,289
I'm peeing
almost half a gallon of beer.

252
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,925
- That's OK.
- Thank you.

253
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,065
What's your name?

254
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,968
Katia. And you?

255
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,170
Sam.

256
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,506
Hello, Sam.

257
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,507
Hello.

258
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm done.

259
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,749
Thank...

260
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,924
Thank you.

261
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,326
OK.

262
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:40,832
Hello.

263
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,268
What are you doing here?

264
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,906
Well, you told me
you were going to stay here,

265
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,941
so I brought you dinner.

266
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,977
How's your friend?

267
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,815
She jumped from the fourth floor,
and nothing happened to her.

268
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,350
What?

269
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,019
Thank you for dinner.

270
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,859
What?

271
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,863
I love you.

272
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,434
- Andrea.
- What the hell? She scared me.

273
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,835
What is it?

274
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,036
Miguel?

275
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,172
No. Don't summon Satan.

276
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,941
He's Alberto.

277
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,677
You don't know him.
He's Alberto.

278
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,646
Miguel.

279
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,216
Yes, dear,
in your nightmares, he's Miguel.

280
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,553
YOUR DRIVER HAS ARRIVED

281
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,126
Samantha?

282
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,561
No. I'm Katia.

283
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,496
I'm here for Samantha.

284
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,531
I'm Samantha.

285
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,336
I'm sorry. I thought it was mine.

286
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,437
Don't worry.

287
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,508
Um... Do you want a lift?

288
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,147
I was rejected
by the hottest guy in the place.

289
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,616
I tried, but nothing worked.

290
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,252
I mean, who understands them?
What do they want?

291
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,223
Look at my shades, my hair, my top...

292
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,029
In tonight's
"Most romantic videos at midnight,"

293
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,367
a woman proposes to some guy
in the bathroom.

294
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,970
Smile, handsome!

295
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,106
What the fuck? Give me that!
Give me that! Come on!

296
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,618
Because, in the past, like...

297
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,156
20 years ago, I think,

298
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,857
I used to work around here.

299
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,662
This was my route,
from here to Polanco.

300
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,065
I sold oranges on a truck
with my husband.

301
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,537
But he died five years ago.

302
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,108
I didn't dare to come here
from the ranch

303
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,510
with the oranges on my own.

304
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,648
So I decided to learn how to drive,

305
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,218
sold the truck and bought this car.

306
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,323
Since then,
I've been working as a driver.

307
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,581
You were gone for a while.
Where were you?

308
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,850
I was drinking with a friend of mine.

309
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,055
Hey, there.

310
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,457
Hey!

311
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,361
<i>Ohana, my friend!</i>

312
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,962
Welcome, my brother.

313
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,631
- Have this.
- All right.

314
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,832
Here you go.

315
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:39,371
- Mati. My love, how are you?
- Hello. I'm fine, and you?

316
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,072
I'm fine. It's nice to see you.

317
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,041
Come on. Give me a strong hug.

318
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,043
- This feels good.
- How are you?

319
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,144
Hello.

320
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,679
Hello. How are you?

321
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,517
Come with me.

322
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,091
Let's give ourselves in!

323
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,459
Welcome.

324
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,764
We're ready to take off.

325
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,434
Let me introduce you to Mateo,
our new crew member.

326
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,536
You already know
this damn San Bernardo.

327
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,305
Finally, you brought a handsome one.

328
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,906
Hello, Mati.

329
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,042
What's that?

330
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,110
DMT.

331
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,646
Come on. Get over here.

332
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,222
Are you going to do it?

333
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,158
Definitely.

334
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,960
What about you?

335
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,094
That's my thing.

336
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,330
- Yes.
- That's nice.

337
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,464
What about you?

338
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,565
Yes.

339
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,666
All right.

340
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:15,967
Mateo!

341
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,036
Mateo!

342
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,472
Mateo!

343
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,704
Mateo.

344
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,640
Mateo.

345
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,425
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,895
Did the fool wake up?

347
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,501
Turn it off. Turn it off.

348
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,305
- Very good. Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm all right.

349
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,541
Can you make it home?

350
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,311
Yes. I think it's that way, isn't it?

351
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,854
Here, here.

352
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,706
Mateo.

353
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,707
Yes?

354
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,714
How did she die?

355
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,552
My mother?

356
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,227
Cancer.

357
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,332
I'm sorry.

358
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,536
Good night.

359
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,874
LORE NEW MESSAGE

360
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,058
<i>Smile, handsome!</i>

361
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,094
<i>What the fuck? Give me that!</i>

362
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,665
Beny.

363
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,335
Beny.

364
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,705
What the hell?

365
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,908
The hell is this video
everybody's watching in the chats.

366
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:05,943
No shit.

367
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,913
This was last night, right?
You're wearing the same clothes.

368
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,047
Did Kat watch it?

369
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,850
She hasn't told me anything,
but she'll find out eventually.

370
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,419
Shit.

371
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,687
- Shit.
- Go see her!

372
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,656
Yes, yes, yes.

373
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,225
I'll go see her.

374
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:36,107
BENY INCOMING CALL

375
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,419
Good morning, Carlitos.

376
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,557
It'll surprise you
how much you're like your father.

377
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,461
I don't know. I didn't know him.

378
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,064
Do you live alone?

379
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,966
Yes.

380
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,137
On the weekends,
I visit my grandparents near London.

381
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,574
How long are you planning
to stay here?

382
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,144
I don't know. A couple of weeks.

383
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,179
Good.

384
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,515
What do you do?

385
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,050
I'm a writer.

386
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,719
What do you write?

387
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,120
Books.

388
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:27,959
Good morning.

389
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,560
Do you have rehearsal?

390
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:31,929
Rehearsal?

391
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,331
Theater.

392
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,366
Do you study theater?

393
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,734
It's a workshop.

394
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,035
You should come by.

395
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,709
Bye, mom.

396
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,110
Bye, Mati.

397
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,053
I'm going out to take some pictures.

398
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,321
OK.

399
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,757
Do you want to come?

400
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,460
Yes.

401
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,461
Yes, I do.

402
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,696
Let me get my shoes.

403
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,336
What?

404
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:20,978
What are you looking at?

405
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,880
Your ass.

406
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,717
You need to go back to the gym.

407
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,423
Maybe I'll go to the same gym

408
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,492
you've never been
in your damned life.

409
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,495
You curly asshole.

410
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,363
Let's go.

411
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,631
See you around, curly.

412
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,485
Listen...

413
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,255
Can I ask you a question?

414
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,157
Yes.

415
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,529
Your vagina is different, isn't it?

416
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,533
I'd say it's way too different.

417
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,468
Really?

418
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:24,875
Well, yes.
It wasn't always like this.

419
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,043
How "like this"?

420
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,779
It wasn't always a vagina.

421
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,089
What are you doing here?

422
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,092
What are you two doing here?

423
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,127
We're having breakfast.

424
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:44,762
She's Sam.

425
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,665
She stayed here last night.

426
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,568
I thought
you were exhausted last night.

427
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,538
Yes, but it was a last-minute thing.
Sam didn't have a place to stay.

428
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:57,842
Hello.

429
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,645
Hello.

430
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,053
Well, I'll go get changed.

431
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,287
OK.

432
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,269
What is it?

433
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:26,837
Who's Sam?

434
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,973
She's a friend.

435
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,875
Why don't I know her?

436
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,310
Because she's not your friend.

437
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,448
Did she spend the night here?

438
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,919
Where did you spend the night?

439
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,422
At Mati's.

440
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,160
What did you do after the party?

441
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,431
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

442
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,101
Don't tell me you got a blowjob
and you were recorded.

443
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,737
How did you know?

444
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,108
50,000 people and I saw it.

445
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,647
Aren't you mad?

446
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,551
- No. Why?
- You're not breaking up with me?

447
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,252
Why would I do that?

448
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,354
I cheated on you.

449
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,256
No, you didn't.

450
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:24,562
I don't expect you to be faithful.
You're not a damned penguin.

451
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,733
But it would be great if you weren't
the GIF people send in their chats,

452
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,968
because we're together somehow, Beny.

453
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,637
A viral video is not the way
to tell people

454
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,039
we're in an open relationship.

455
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,242
Are we in an open relationship?

456
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,111
Yes.

457
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,512
Aren't we?

458
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,781
It's OK.

459
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,649
- Good.
- Good.

460
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,052
OK...

461
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,224
As we're talking things over,

462
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,493
I want to seize the opportunity

463
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,963
to tell you
that you need to take some pills.

464
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,580
Hey, what are you doing?

465
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,318
You look a lot like your father.

466
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,488
I wouldn't know. I didn't know him.

467
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,493
He made me...

468
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,932
He made me feel... unique.

469
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,837
It seems he did that to everyone.

470
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,911
Let me take a picture of you.

471
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,245
No, I don't like it.

472
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,447
Stand there, and let me
take a picture of you.

473
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,616
No.

474
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:54,952
Were you there?

475
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,721
What?

476
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,824
When my father died.

477
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,126
Really?

478
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,095
Do you really want to talk about it?

479
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,096
Yes.

480
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,498
Yes.

481
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,967
Where were you exactly?

482
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,672
At the apartment's door.

483
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,641
At the apartment's door.

484
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,912
What's the distance
between the apartment's door

485
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,581
and the elevator's door?

486
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,052
How should I know that?

487
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,254
What about Carlos?

488
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,923
He was next to me.

489
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,960
- At the apartment's door?
- Yes.

490
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,095
What about Miguel?

491
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,130
Miguel?

492
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,268
At the apartment's door.

493
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,872
What size was that fucking door?

494
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,510
The three of you were
at the apartment's door,

495
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,079
and none of you did anything.

496
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,483
What were we supposed to have done?

497
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,118
- What?
- I don't know.

498
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,320
Maybe stop him from killing himself.

499
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,558
We had had an argument.

500
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,727
With my father?

501
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,564
Yes.

502
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,833
The three of you?

503
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,736
Your father didn't want
to be there any longer.

504
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,474
Did you want him to stay longer?

505
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,044
Your father was...

506
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,647
Well...

507
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,416
difficult.

508
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,686
That's why you kicked him out.

509
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,923
- What?
- Of the apartment.

510
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:46,297
Do you think that we kicked
your father out of the apartment?

511
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,570
I think my father wasn't well,
and you didn't help him.

512
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:05,916
Andrea.

513
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,718
We're leaving.

514
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:09,753
We're going to the...

515
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,323
Is he...?

516
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,325
I'm Tomás' son.

517
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,628
- María, Andrea.
- Yes.

518
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,730
Could you push her?

519
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:20,731
Yes.

520
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,136
- Listen, why did you bring him here?
- He wanted to meet you, guys.

521
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:29,073
Yes, but not here.
We're going to see the psychiatrist.

522
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,274
Well, that's why.

523
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,344
Hello.

524
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,925
So, my father and you...

525
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,963
Your father was terrible.

526
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,667
He was a mess.

527
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,160
That's enough, boy.

528
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,264
That's funny.

529
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,033
Fool.

530
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,367
You're the fool.

531
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,837
She's the real fool who jumped off.

532
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,442
Don't make me laugh.

533
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,916
SO EARLY AROUND HERE?

534
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,218
I'M BORED.

535
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,420
I CAN FIX THAT.

536
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,355
DO YOU PROMISE?

537
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,523
BOY SCOUT'S WORD.

538
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,657
HEY...

539
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,492
TELL ME.

540
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,128
I'M MARRIED. YOU DON'T MIND?

541
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,365
NOT AT ALL.
I'M IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

542
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,876
You slept with him.

543
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,080
I know it.
I can see it in your eyes.

544
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,551
We're not pure anymore.
Do you understand me?

545
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,054
Every time you touch me,
I'll be thinking you touched him.

546
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,456
We can start from scratch.

547
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,025
Start from scratch?
You cheated on me!

548
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,660
Please...

549
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,528
I didn't know what I was doing.

550
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,832
You didn't know what you were doing.

551
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,301
I've always given you everything.

552
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,936
- When...
- Sorry!

553
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,038
Can we stop?

554
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,779
Matilde, we've been
many times through this.

555
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,816
Yes. She always interrupts
when I'm about to start my monologue.

556
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,284
Let's do it again, please.

557
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,457
You slept with him.

558
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,026
I know it.
I can see it in your eyes.

559
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,463
We're not pure anymore.
Do you understand me?

560
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,265
No.

561
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,167
Sorry?

562
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,702
- It's ridiculous!
- What?

563
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,836
"What?"

564
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,038
Yes, Matilde, what?
I'm not following you.

565
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,474
What the hell do you mean
by "We're not pure"?

566
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,344
Can't he get over the fact
that she slept with another man?

567
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,645
It's just sex.

568
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,947
Some of us do want
a closed relationship.

569
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,115
That's why we broke up.

570
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,752
Matilde, doesn't an emotional
infidelity mean anything to you?

571
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,622
There are already apps
to screw strangers.

572
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,291
Are we still making a fuss
because of infidelity?

573
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,160
Isn't there anything more interesting

574
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,462
to tell about two people
who love each other?

575
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,932
Matilde, the play
is called "Infidelity".

576
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,967
Well, even the title is wrong!

577
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,435
OK. Well...

578
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,039
I think we've spent
too many hours working.

579
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,908
Let's wrap it up for today.

580
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,277
And once again,
I didn't do my monologue.

581
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,979
- Thank you, Mati.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,615
Yes. Unfortunately.

583
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,219
We need another actress.

584
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,425
I like your progressive mentality.

585
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,332
It may have to do
with the fact that Jimmy,

586
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,035
Mr. "We're not pure anymore,"
is my ex-boyfriend,

587
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,737
who broke up with me
because I cheated on him.

588
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,140
And the director is one
of those idiots who write

589
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,908
about the experiences
of his actors.

590
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,877
Shall we leave?

591
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,078
Yes. I'll go get changed.

592
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,049
Fidelity is the way we've found

593
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,886
to hold on to someone enough time
to get old and have someone there

594
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:40,023
to feed us baby food
and change our diapers.

595
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,261
The truth is
that we're afraid of being alone,

596
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,829
and that's what we call love.

597
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,702
My mother wasn't
with anyone else after Tomás.

598
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,470
That's what you think.

599
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,573
They sure went to your house
and told you they were your uncles.

600
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,979
She called them "co-workers."

601
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,115
But they used to leave
in the same way they came in.

602
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,718
My mother wouldn't let them stay.

603
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,924
One way or another,
she was always with Tomás.

604
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,630
She ended up with a nurse

605
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,933
who fed her baby food with a spoon

606
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,535
and changed her diapers.

607
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,240
But she didn't regret a thing.

608
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,910
Some cycles need to be completed,

609
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,281
but it would be nice
to find someone to get old with,

610
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,649
a friend, a couple.

611
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,250
What do I know?

612
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,488
Isn't that Beny?

613
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:49,660
What the hell?

614
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,766
- What happened?
- Do you have something I can put on?

615
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,668
- I've got a dress here.
- Give it to me.

616
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,102
Hop on. Put the helmet on.

617
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,138
Hurry, hurry!

618
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,942
You son of a bitch!

619
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,145
Come back, son of a bitch!

620
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,716
Did you always know?

621
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:16,253
Yes, I've always known
since I have memory.

622
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,757
Since I was a child,
I've been like this. I've been Sam.

623
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,960
Everybody could notice, you know?

624
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,897
It's not like I've been
through such a big change.

625
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,966
In school, my friends, my family.

626
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,971
I met Fichas in elementary school.

627
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,376
We were the freaky ones.

628
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,278
- Is that so?
- That's why we got along.

629
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,716
What about your parents?

630
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,718
- They're cool with it.
- Really?

631
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,086
- Yes.
- Really?

632
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,323
The truth is that I was very lucky
because it's not the usual reaction.

633
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,324
Right.

634
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,165
Cut it out, you fuckers.

635
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,836
Beny, you can join me later
in the bathroom. I saw this video,

636
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,672
and I thought of some
really good blowjobs we can perform.

637
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,673
You're so funny.

638
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,111
What...?

639
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,781
What are you doing here?

640
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,417
Sam is a friend of Fichas.

641
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,153
- She's Matilde.
- Hello.

642
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,655
- He's Tomás.
- Mateo.

643
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,458
I'm sorry, Mateo.

644
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,162
You already know the lady in dress.

645
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,630
Hello.

646
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,631
Hello.

647
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,966
I'm Beny.

648
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,701
Hello.

649
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,369
What's with the dress?

650
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,772
I was hot.

651
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,278
You have an exhibition coming.
Mati told me.

652
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,447
- Yes.
- What is it about?

653
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,917
I've edited some photographs
of people who've changed my life.

654
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,352
Do you mean your girlfriends?

655
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,956
Yes. My couples...

656
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,627
and people who've been with me
and taking care of me.

657
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,628
Like your parents.

658
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:10,333
Well, curiously,
I didn't know my father.

659
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,102
Really?

660
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,471
I didn't know mine, either.

661
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,072
What happened to him?

662
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,309
My mother told me
it was a romantic night,

663
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:24,548
she got pregnant,
and then he disappeared.

664
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:26,950
Just like Tomás.

665
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,319
Kind of.

666
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,423
So, you two never knew your fathers.

667
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,158
I've only seen him in pictures.

668
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,693
Is that so?

669
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,094
Yes, look. In fact...

670
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,243
I don't even have one.

671
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,081
I really don't need it.

672
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,549
Right?

673
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,653
- Do you want to get some drinks?
- Yes. Let's do it.

674
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,754
Cheers.

675
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,922
"Gringuito"!

676
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,858
You can sleep in Katia's bedroom.

677
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,660
She doesn't come home
to sleep as much as I wish.

678
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,629
But you'll feel great.

679
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,697
You can't drink.

680
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,132
I'm sorry. You can't drink.

681
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,637
- It's just that you can't.
- OK, OK, as you say.

682
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,040
Mateo knows Tomás killed himself.

683
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,777
I don't know why he's here.

684
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,415
To mess things up. What else?
Well, I don't really know.

685
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,887
He's just identical to her father.

686
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,955
That's the thing with kids.

687
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,058
They're an eternal reminder
of things we must get over.

688
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,299
They're also a reminder
of our secrets.

689
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,646
ALBERTO INCOMING CALL

690
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,330
ANDREA OUTGOING CALL

691
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,473
That chick's so hot.

692
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,108
What chick?

693
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:33,977
Sam?

694
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,712
Yes. Do you know her?

695
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,948
Do I know her?

696
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,750
She's like my best friend.

697
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,352
Is that so?

698
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,489
I've been with her
through all her transitions.

699
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,162
She's one of the first girls...

700
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,832
who transformed, dude.

701
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,967
Transformed into what?

702
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,473
How does it feel?

703
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:06,910
What?

704
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,845
Not knowing your father.

705
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,718
Have you been to London?

706
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,157
How does it feel not knowing London?

707
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:24,961
London's not my father.

708
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,367
It feels...

709
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,575
incomplete.

710
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,418
I read my father's diary, and...

711
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,155
It's like I've written it myself.

712
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,161
He felt lonely.

713
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,479
I've spent all my life
fighting the enemy.

714
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,483
I ended up becoming him.

715
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,721
I became everything I hated.

716
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,160
I became comfortable.

717
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,566
I got old.

718
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,972
But comfort is tricky.

719
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,342
It anchors you.

720
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,546
It gets you stuck.

721
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:36,519
I ended up entangled in a whirlwind
from which I didn't want to get out.

722
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,058
And I jumped off a building.

723
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,662
I jumped off a freaking building
and I didn't die.

724
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,368
Andrea...

725
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,140
I never apologized to you.

726
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,109
I'm sorry.

727
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,948
I'm sorry for everything.

728
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,350
I'm sorry.

729
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,252
- What's up?
- What's up?

730
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,153
I'm leaving.

731
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,256
Already?

732
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:47,624
- Yes...
- Are you all right?

733
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,359
Yes, I'm all right.

734
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:52,462
It's only that I don't want
to get too wasted today

735
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:53,563
because of the retreat.

736
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,366
I wanted to know
if you want to come with me,

737
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:57,433
or if I see you there.

738
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,904
- I'll see you there, OK?
- OK.

739
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,575
Listen, do you want
to spend the night with me?

740
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,312
I want to stay longer here with Sam.

741
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,081
OK.

742
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,622
Well, I'm leaving now.

743
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:20,623
OK.

744
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,129
Goodbye.

745
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,097
Goodbye.

746
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:30,700
Cool.

747
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,035
Cool.

748
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,330
You don't know
how to get into your house.

749
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,538
They're sleeping.

750
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:16,579
Good night.

751
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,348
Matilde.

752
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,719
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

753
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,639
This is my father's diary.

754
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,842
I found it here.

755
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,697
My mother and Tomás.

756
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,233
- Hello.
- Look at her.

757
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,235
- María!
- What a brat.

758
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,570
- No. Be careful.
- What's wrong?

759
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,708
- Easy, easy.
- What happened to you?

760
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,348
I was feeling a little sick.
Nothing happened.

761
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,550
- A little sick?
- We talk about it later, OK?

762
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,951
Are you all right?

763
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,154
I stumbled.

764
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,558
Did you use one of your seven lives?

765
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,528
Like three of them.

766
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,565
You're indestructible, María.

767
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,567
Exactly.

768
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,572
Sweetheart, do you want to stay
and sleep with us?

769
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,376
Yes, but I have to get up
early tomorrow.

770
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,078
Why?

771
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,081
Because Beny's playing didgeridoo
in a retreat.

772
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,549
What does he play?

773
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:00,950
Didgeridoo.

774
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,953
It's an instrument that makes
this sound

775
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,656
and puts people into trance.

776
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,492
It's a millennial thing, María.

777
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,094
Yes, it's millenary.

778
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,664
It's... It's curative.

779
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:15,865
OK.

780
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,567
Do you want to come?

781
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:18,734
What?

782
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,036
It can work for you.

783
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,571
To a retreat?

784
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,474
Yes. It's just for the weekend.

785
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,343
Think about it.

786
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:46,762
María, what were you doing
before jumping into a buffet?

787
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,233
I didn't know
they were having a buffet.

788
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:51,968
What happened to you?

789
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:56,672
You were a badass. You were going
to save the world, right?

790
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:02,345
As a zoologist, you helped primates.
You work at the San Diego Zoo.

791
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,180
I don't do it anymore.

792
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,915
No. I just sign papers now.

793
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,018
And I take part
in the exploitation of animals

794
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,686
and the destruction of the planet.

795
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:14,624
I've never earned
so much money in my life.

796
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,895
Then I started mixing
whisky with Rivotril.

797
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,364
I came to Mexico this time

798
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,533
to screw up the flora
and fauna of this country.

799
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:26,369
So, I preferred to smash
the continental breakfast.

800
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,578
Well, I used to be a man.

801
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,364
Mati?

802
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:57,667
What the hell?

803
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,937
Can't you knock the damned door?

804
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,472
I can't believe it.
This can't be happening!

805
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,508
We fell asleep!

806
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,310
Yes, honey.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

807
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:08,578
All right!

808
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,348
We had sex all night
and then we put our clothes back on.

809
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,150
We fell asleep!

810
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,285
We fell asleep reading Tomás' diary.

811
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,254
Do you have my diary?

812
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,856
- Your diary?
- Where did you get it from?

813
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,325
I found it with this.

814
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:23,659
Holy shit!

815
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,230
Did my father and you...?

816
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,764
You'll have to leave this house.

817
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,132
Why?

818
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,468
Because we're not going
through this again.

819
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,870
Just because you did
stupid things 20 years ago,

820
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,038
we have to suffer now?

821
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,074
Kind of. That's what
being a child is about.

822
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,476
- Ana...
- No! You have to leave now!

823
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:41,777
Father!

824
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,180
Matilde, you don't have
a say this time.

825
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,450
I know you don't want to experience
again everything that happened,

826
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,051
but I want an explanation!

827
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,119
That's why I'm here.

828
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,088
To understand Tomás.

829
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:55,891
Ana.

830
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,729
I grew up being the son of a ghost.

831
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,668
And now you're telling me I can't
know everything that happened.

832
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,105
Mateo...

833
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,174
I'm so sorry you didn't find
the answers you were looking for.

834
01:05:12,908 --> 01:05:15,244
I'm sorry, but it's like
having your father here.

835
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:19,315
It messes things up,
and I won't let you mess things up.

836
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,817
You need to leave.

837
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:32,028
Things already were messed up.

838
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:06,929
Where are you going?

839
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,100
The exhibition organizers
offered me accommodation.

840
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:13,169
Let me know where.

841
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:15,438
Yes.

842
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,311
Come to the exhibition, OK?

843
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,149
Mateo.

844
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:13,929
Why did you kick him out?

845
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,503
No, sweetheart.

846
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,774
There are some things
you can't understand just yet.

847
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:26,842
Explain them to me.

848
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,285
Tell me.

849
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,950
<i>- Sat Nam.
- Namaste.</i>

850
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,084
God bless you.

851
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,085
Thank you.

852
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,654
Thank you.

853
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,122
Thank you.

854
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:16,358
It's prohibited
to contaminate the sanctuary.

855
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,327
Please, put your cigarette out.

856
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,534
There you go.

857
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,269
There you go.

858
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,278
Yes, I'm the one you spoke with.

859
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,828
This is nice.

860
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,275
Under what name
did you make the reservation?

861
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,276
Katia Maldonado.

862
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:12,715
Your stay is covered
because it's on the house,

863
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,682
thanks to Benjamín.

864
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,418
But you'll need to pay two more rooms.

865
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,288
- How much is it?
- It's 9950 pesos, please.

866
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,656
Per person?

867
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,526
This is daylight robbery.

868
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:28,297
In this space,
thanks to the Master's teachings,

869
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:32,468
we consider that simplicity,
frugality and abstinence

870
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:36,438
are the right way to find oneself,

871
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,843
but to materialize it,
we need your donation.

872
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,280
- Do you want me to...?
- No, it's OK.

873
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,881
No, no. Don't worry.

874
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,316
It's on me.

875
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,617
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

876
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,652
Thank you, María.

877
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,689
- Do you accept credit cards?
- Yes, any of them.

878
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,158
Of course.

879
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,266
Could you hand it to me
with your right hand?

880
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,503
Hey.

881
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,871
- Hello.
- Hello.

882
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,943
Can I have a word
with my girlfriend, please?

883
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,381
Yes. It's OK.

884
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:53,749
I'll see you later.

885
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,351
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

886
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,885
OK, I'll see you.

887
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:58,854
What's wrong?

888
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,125
Why did you bring her?

889
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,494
Sam?

890
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,862
Yes. Sam.

891
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,497
Well, we came here with María.

892
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:09,965
Didn't you see her?

893
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,567
Yes, I did.

894
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,738
Are you still mad about the video?

895
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:20,109
No. I told you
I was not mad about it.

896
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,644
So? I don't understand.

897
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,446
I think it's weird. I don't like it.

898
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,751
Why does it bother you
that I brought Sam?

899
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,918
Besides what's evident?

900
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,421
Yes, besides what's evident.

901
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,624
I've heard things about her.

902
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,493
That she has a dick between her legs.

903
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,961
Does she have a dick?

904
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,697
Yes, it's like 20 inches long.

905
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,332
- How cool.
- Yes.

906
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:44,867
Sweet.

907
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,137
No, she doesn't have a dick.

908
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,242
- What if she did? What's the problem?
- It's just that I don't understand.

909
01:11:53,308 --> 01:11:56,178
I'd expect
that you weren't such an idiot.

910
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:57,279
Did you screw her?

911
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,053
Are you going to be
this kind of idiot?

912
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,254
- No?
- No.

913
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,291
No. I won't be that kind of idiot,
but I don't want you to screw him,

914
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,927
or her, or whatever she is.

915
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,462
I'm sorry. I can't deal with it.

916
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,270
Well, I think you've got
the wrong girlfriend.

917
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,693
Focus on your breathing.

918
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,931
Open your heart.

919
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,135
Expand your spirit.

920
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,906
Set your inner being free.

921
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:04,046
Prepare yourselves
for the Master's arrival.

922
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,858
Prepare yourselves
for the Master's arrival.

923
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,524
<i>- Sat Nam, Siri.
- Sat Nam, Master.</i>

924
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,671
<i>Sat Nam, sisters, brothers.</i>

925
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:08,777
The being...

926
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,016
that can be divinely good alone,

927
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,887
will know how to be
divinely good accompanied.

928
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:27,062
We are here to find inner peace.

929
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,443
Who brought a cell phone
to the sanctuary?

930
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,049
Katia.

931
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,483
Katia, it's your phone.

932
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,686
Did anyone bring a cell phone
to the sanctuary?

933
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,956
Find it. Where is it?

934
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,425
Siri!

935
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,093
Hurry up. Find it.

936
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:00,095
Take it easy, Master. Your aura.

937
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,097
God fucking damn it!

938
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,633
I've got it. I've got it.

939
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,934
We have signs!

940
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:09,037
I've got it.
I turned it off. Sorry.

941
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:12,841
Miguel?

942
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:20,449
María?

943
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,255
What happened to you?

944
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,625
I got enlightened.

945
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:32,461
Yes.

946
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,296
What about you?

947
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,899
I took a beating.

948
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,435
Hi, Mati. What happened?

949
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,038
<i>My parents kicked Mateo
out of the house.</i>

950
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,173
<i>- What?
- They don't explain me anything.</i>

951
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,509
<i>Since he arrived,
they've been acting strange,</i>

952
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,645
<i>and they won't let me go
to the exhibition.</i>

953
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:50,646
Say what!

954
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,381
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

955
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,316
I wish you were here.

956
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,952
<i>You don't know what happened.</i>

957
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,087
What?

958
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:04,626
Miguel, my mother's ex-husband,
is the damned spiritual guide.

959
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:05,928
<i>What?</i>

960
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,330
He's the damned guru.

961
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,065
Are you sure?

962
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,302
<i>María went pale when she saw him.</i>

963
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:19,141
<i>I've got to go. I love you.
I'll talk to you later, OK?</i>

964
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,243
<i>- Bye.
- See you later.</i>

965
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,974
He said he was sorry,
and I gave him another opportunity.

966
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,242
- Don't come crying later.
- OK.

967
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,577
Where's Alberto?

968
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,246
- I don't know. He didn't come today.
- I know.

969
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:00,615
Why?

970
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,752
I don't know.
He's not even answering his phone.

971
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,857
Do you think I did the right thing
giving him another opportunity?

972
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:10,759
What?

973
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,296
Don't come crying later.

974
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,376
<i>Sisters, brothers, Sat Nam.</i>

975
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,144
<i>Sat Nam.</i>

976
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,113
You may sit, please.

977
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,350
Enjoy the dinner.

978
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,559
Couldn't you have found
an intermediate point?

979
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:45,827
Sorry?

980
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,564
You went from being
a cocaine-addicted publicist

981
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,500
to being a freaking Krishnamurti.

982
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,835
These have been...

983
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,305
very difficult times, María.

984
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,308
<i>- Sure.
- Sat Nam, Master.</i>

985
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,777
<i>Satnam, Siri.</i>

986
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,514
Is there something
in particular disturbing you?

987
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:09,251
- Do you want me to call the bouncer?
- The bouncer?

988
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,354
Everything is fine, my dear Siri.
Thank you.

989
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,257
- I'll be around in case you need me.
- Sure.

990
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,159
Serve the lady.

991
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,501
<i>- Namaste.
- Thank you.</i>

992
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:31,973
Is she your daughter?

993
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:33,542
Katia?

994
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:34,843
Katia?

995
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,180
How long haven't you been Miguel?

996
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:39,681
A long time.

997
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:41,550
How old is she?

998
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,452
She's 20.

999
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:44,453
20 years old?

1000
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,488
You're a spiritual guide now?

1001
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:51,460
Yes. I mean, María, you know me.

1002
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:53,562
You know my life.

1003
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:55,864
I hit rock bottom.

1004
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:01,736
All the relationships I had
made me sick.

1005
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,041
So, I needed to leave.

1006
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,477
I had to.

1007
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,650
20 years old.

1008
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,825
20 years old.

1009
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,231
María...

1010
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,236
Katia is our daughter.

1011
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,672
- What?
- Katia is our daughter.

1012
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,441
- No!
- Don't you realize?

1013
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,077
- No, Miguel.
- It's been 20 years, for God's sake.

1014
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,880
- She's not.
- Stop hiding it from me.

1015
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,181
Miguel, let go.

1016
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,683
You're hurting me.
Let go.

1017
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:50,252
Miguel!

1018
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,454
No!

1019
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,295
<i>- Sat Nam.
- Sat Nam, Master.</i>

1020
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:07,435
Master...

1021
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:36,231
<i>Hello, this is Andrea.
Leave your message.</i>

1022
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,234
Andrea, where are you?

1023
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,537
Miguel is here at the retreat,
and he noticed Katia.

1024
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:45,273
I don't know what to do.
I knew this was going to happen.

1025
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,509
What should I do? Call me.

1026
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,948
This shit...

1027
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:55,550
Where the hell...?

1028
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,720
María, is Katia our daughter?

1029
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,524
Answer me! Goddammit!

1030
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,293
Let go of me.

1031
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,340
You haven't changed a bit
in the last 20 years.

1032
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,559
What happened to us?

1033
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,668
María, please, don't lie to me.

1034
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,710
Is Katia our daughter?

1035
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,351
No.

1036
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,622
She's not our daughter.

1037
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:10,558
Good.

1038
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,228
She's not my daughter.

1039
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,737
She's my daughter.

1040
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,244
Katia's my daughter.

1041
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,356
Andrea.

1042
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:47,829
Miguel...

1043
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:51,499
Miguel. Miguel.

1044
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,354
Honey...

1045
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,059
we need to talk to Matilde.

1046
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,161
No.

1047
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:57,665
No.

1048
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,167
No.

1049
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,372
No.

1050
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,143
Then, I'm going to talk to Mateo.

1051
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:14,749
Carlos, stop it.

1052
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,152
Stop it, stop it.

1053
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:22,157
Stop stirring things up. Stop it.

1054
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:23,324
Matilde's my daughter.

1055
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,096
I'm protecting her.

1056
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,465
Nobody's going to hurt her.

1057
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:47,715
I love you, curly.

1058
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,616
Master?

1059
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,154
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1060
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,422
Me?

1061
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,459
I heard a noise,
and I'm making sure everything's OK.

1062
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:32,627
- A noise?
- Yes.

1063
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:33,728
What kind of noise?

1064
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:37,732
Screams. Horrible screams.
Horrible screams.

1065
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:38,933
In there?

1066
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,134
Yes.

1067
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:42,871
Is Katia inside?

1068
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,372
Who? I don't know.

1069
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:47,642
Beny, what the...?

1070
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,278
What are you doing?

1071
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,746
- Katia is...
- What?

1072
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,715
You're spying on me.
That's the truth.

1073
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:54,749
No.

1074
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,317
No? What's wrong with you?

1075
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:57,652
I wanted to talk to you.

1076
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,554
What do you want to talk to me about?

1077
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:01,656
- I mean, I wanted to see you.
- See me?

1078
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,691
It's not what you think.

1079
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,960
No. You're sick.

1080
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,295
What's all this noise?

1081
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:11,933
- No, no. Katia, I'm Miguel, OK?
- So?

1082
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,702
I'm your father.

1083
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,376
What?

1084
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,046
You're my daughter.

1085
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:31,653
María?

1086
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,734
No.

1087
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:51,339
- No, no! Get out of my way!
- Katia.

1088
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:52,340
No! No!

1089
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,337
Katia!

1090
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:23,504
Get out of the way!

1091
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,639
Get out of the way!

1092
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:29,344
Get out of the way!

1093
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,118
Are you OK?

1094
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,089
Are you OK?
Get out of the car.

1095
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:43,925
Come.

1096
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:46,127
Carefully.

1097
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,563
Sit down.

1098
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,366
Katia.

1099
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,706
Katia, are you OK?
Are you OK?

1100
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,575
Why didn't you tell me?

1101
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,445
Why didn't you tell me
Miguel was my father?

1102
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,247
Why didn't you tell me?

1103
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:11,319
Because it was not my place
to tell you.

1104
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,690
I'm sorry.
Katia, it was not my place.

1105
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,026
No, no, no.

1106
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:22,730
No. I've never needed you!
I don't need you! OK?

1107
01:28:46,754 --> 01:28:50,124
This is so good.
Where did you get all this material?

1108
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:51,959
I inherited it.

1109
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:55,463
You do look like him.

1110
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:57,231
He's my father.

1111
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,969
Are you sure you want
to change it all at the last minute?

1112
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:06,274
I'm sorry. The other one
doesn't make sense to me anymore.

1113
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,109
Yes, but I'm worried

1114
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,278
that the materials
might not be ready on time.

1115
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:13,881
No, Gonzalo, please,
they must be ready on time.

1116
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,497
Someone's looking for you.

1117
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:36,637
Mateo...

1118
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:38,306
Yes?

1119
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,976
Can I buy you a beer?

1120
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:46,380
I'd rather have
a shot of tequila, Carlitos.

1121
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:48,416
OK.

1122
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,885
You can call me "Carlitos."

1123
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,420
Thank you.

1124
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:14,308
Does Matilde know?

1125
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:16,544
No.

1126
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:23,251
Tomás didn't know about me, either.

1127
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,457
My mother knew he wouldn't stay, so...

1128
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,495
She always wanted a son, so...

1129
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:36,664
He'd never stay.

1130
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:40,334
He'd arrive, make a mess, and leave.

1131
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:41,936
Just like you.

1132
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:54,549
I just wanted to know.
It wasn't my intention.

1133
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,684
I know.

1134
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:00,621
You wanted to know,
but there are other ways.

1135
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:04,625
That's why I'm here.

1136
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,698
To tell you everything I know,
and everything you want to know.

1137
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,703
Carlos...

1138
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,873
I'm also doing this because
I don't want Matilde to get hurt.

1139
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,247
Cheers.

1140
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,868
Why didn't you tell me
Miguel is my father?

1141
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,437
Answer me, mother!
Answer me!

1142
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:52,907
Let's talk. Calm down.

1143
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:55,776
No, I don't even know what to think.
I don't understand!

1144
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:00,514
I didn't know what to do.

1145
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:08,289
Beny...

1146
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:22,069
Get out of my house, please.

1147
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,339
Why didn't you tell me?

1148
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,075
Get out of my house, please.

1149
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:29,744
No, Andrea.

1150
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:34,115
I beg you, please, to give me
a chance to talk to you.

1151
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:35,816
Please.

1152
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,087
What happened...

1153
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,124
was terrible.

1154
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,361
I haven't been able...

1155
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,366
to forgive myself in all these years.

1156
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:57,638
Get out of my house, please.

1157
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:03,878
- We must give ourselves a chance...
- Please, get out of my house.

1158
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:11,819
No.

1159
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,291
I'm sorry.

1160
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,274
Well...

1161
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:11,512
I'm leaving now.

1162
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:35,636
No.

1163
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,638
What's wrong?

1164
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:40,708
No. We can't do this.

1165
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:43,477
Why?

1166
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,281
Because of a number of reasons.

1167
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:53,454
One of them is that I prefer men.

1168
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:55,216
Hi, Kat. How are you?

1169
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:58,119
Kat, I love you.

1170
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,222
I'm very sorry
for what happened, and...

1171
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:04,692
Answer me, please.

1172
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:06,427
Tell me you're all right.

1173
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,705
I'd like to propose a toast,
because we all are in the same place.

1174
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:20,040
Finally, you are meeting Mateo.
Cheers.

1175
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,775
Cheers!

1176
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:24,712
For a successful opening!

1178
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,433
You're not going, OK?

1179
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,070
What? But you're going,
dressed like that, right?

1180
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,240
I'm sorry. You're not going.

1181
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:28,108
Do you want to talk now?

1182
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:31,579
Why are you acting
as if Mateo were a rapist-killer?

1183
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:32,947
You're not going. Period!

1184
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:35,716
That's not how things work!
Tell me, or I'm leaving!

1185
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:42,856
Hello, dear.

1186
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:44,925
Is everything all right?

1187
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,294
A dressing gown
at this time of the day?

1188
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:50,297
My girl.

1189
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,101
I've missed you so much.

1190
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:55,269
Hello, grandma.

1191
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,105
Why the long face?

1192
01:37:58,172 --> 01:37:59,907
Ana and I were having an argument.

1193
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,109
You don't say.
What are you arguing about now?

1194
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,779
She wants to go to this place,
but she's not going!

1195
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:07,181
What place is that?

1196
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:08,916
It's a photo exhibition.

1197
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:10,918
For Christ's sake, Ana.

1198
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:13,887
What's wrong with her
going to a photo exhibition?

1199
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:15,889
- Have this, honey.
- She's not going!

1200
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,926
Why does this house
always smell like gas?

1201
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:22,129
You always ask me to respect
your freedom and sexuality,

1202
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,631
and coexist with it.

1203
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:27,468
Mom, you're an intelligent,
capable woman,

1204
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,570
who makes her own decisions.

1205
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:31,138
Don't you want the same for me?

1206
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:37,344
- What happened to you?
- We need to talk, OK?

1207
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:38,912
God, what happened to you?

1208
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:40,748
Ana...

1209
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:44,451
did you know Miguel is my father?

1210
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:46,487
What?

1211
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:48,889
We're leaving.

1212
01:38:49,923 --> 01:38:52,159
Matilde, don't go! Matilde!

1213
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:53,160
Ana!

1214
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:59,500
What's with
all these restrictions now?

1215
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:04,138
It's a photo exhibition by Tomás' son.

1216
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:06,507
Tomás' son.

1217
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:08,742
Tomás?

1218
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:11,045
Your best friend?

1219
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:14,848
Why don't you all go?
Why don't you go with her?

1220
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:22,856
VISUAL CULTURE CENTER

1221
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:29,196
The search for identity
is a winding, lonely road

1222
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,699
that sometimes leads us
to unexpected places.

1223
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:35,769
But it also leads you to know people
who change the course of our lives.

1224
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:38,339
The past is there
for us to learn from it,

1225
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,043
to avoid repeating it,
to correct its mistakes.

1226
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:45,279
We need to face it without taboos,

1227
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:49,316
with all its pain and all its beauty.

1228
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:52,886
We need to embrace it,

1229
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:55,489
understand it,

1230
01:39:56,724 --> 01:39:58,292
and learn to coexist with it.

1231
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:05,866
<i>You'll see a fragment
of my intimacy,</i>

1232
01:40:05,933 --> 01:40:08,535
<i>of people who changed course</i>

1233
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:10,938
<i>for my life to be what it is.</i>

1234
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,541
<i>They're real people.</i>

1235
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:18,912
<i>They've got different motivations,</i>

1236
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:22,816
<i>and just like the rest of us,
they're trying to survive.</i>

1237
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,621
<i>Welcome.</i>

1238
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:14,468
I know.

1239
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:17,371
I know.

1240
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:24,845
Sometimes, I know
you won't understand

1241
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,781
why I've decided

1242
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:31,452
or done certain things, but...

1243
01:41:34,087 --> 01:41:36,123
the only thing I want you to know is

1244
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:40,260
that everything I've done
since you were born,

1245
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:44,164
I've done it for you to be well.

1246
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:45,833
I do understand.

1247
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:49,069
I do understand.

1248
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:52,139
I need you to understand

1249
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:54,274
that you don't have
to hide anything from me.

1250
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:56,910
- You can trust me, mom.
- Yes.

1251
01:41:57,911 --> 01:41:59,046
I'm your daughter.

1252
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:01,215
I know. I know, sweetheart.

1253
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:15,696
What is it? Why are you so nervous?

1254
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:19,900
I need to talk to Matilde.

1255
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:23,437
I need to tell her the truth.

1256
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:25,072
Don't worry. I talked to Mateo.

1257
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:27,708
You don't have to worry
about anything.

1258
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:30,777
Dear.

1259
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:36,049
It's all thanks to you.

1260
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:39,553
Matilde, you can't be with him.

1261
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:41,221
Ana...

1262
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:42,923
Ana, please.

1263
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:45,259
- Why?
- Just because. Because you can't.

1264
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:46,894
Stop saying that I can't.

1265
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:50,297
I don't give a damn he's the son
of the freaking love of your life.

1266
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:53,133
You are, too.

1267
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:00,507
You might be.

1268
01:43:02,576 --> 01:43:03,577
I don't know.

1269
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:09,816
I'm not... I've never been sure.

1270
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:11,685
I don't know.

1271
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:57,931
We can go to a lab.
They have these tests, right?

1272
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,667
Just to know.

1273
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:03,170
I don't want to know.

1274
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:10,077
You don't want to know
you're not my sister.

1275
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,516
I don't want to know
I'm not my father's daughter.

1276
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:19,119
Do you understand?

1277
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:22,756
I don't want him to know.

1278
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:37,671
Do you want to come with me?

1279
01:44:45,712 --> 01:44:47,948
What time do you have
to be at the airport?

1280
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:52,352
In three hours.

1281
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,331
What is it?

1282
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:06,733
What is it?

1283
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:08,635
I quit.

1284
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,437
Did you quit?

1285
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,541
What are you going to do now?

1286
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:17,711
I don't know.

1287
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:19,046
You're happy!

1288
01:45:23,316 --> 01:45:26,553
But I do know
I don't only have myself.

1289
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:30,223
I have you two.

1290
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:34,327
What's left of us.

1291
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:44,037
It's been a long time, right?

1292
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:48,542
Portrait of three women.

1293
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:51,511
Real women.

1294
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:55,649
It is what it is.

1295
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:48,128
You slept with him.

1296
01:47:50,497 --> 01:47:52,933
I know it.
I can see it in your eyes.

1297
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:55,669
We're not pure anymore.
Do you understand me?

1298
01:47:55,735 --> 01:47:58,505
Every time you touch me,
I'll be thinking you touched him.

1299
01:47:58,572 --> 01:47:59,906
We can start from scratch.

1300
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:02,242
Start from scratch?
You cheated on me!

1301
01:48:03,777 --> 01:48:04,911
I did.

1302
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,102
<i>There are many different ways
to love, Mateo.</i>

1303
01:48:30,036 --> 01:48:32,873
<i>So many, and so different,</i>

1304
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:36,142
<i>that it's easy to feel astray.</i>

1305
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:03,863
<i>The way to love doesn't run
in the blood we inherit, Mateo.</i>

1306
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:06,933
<i>It's rewritten every time,</i>

1307
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:09,135
<i>every moment...</i>

1308
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:11,771
<i>for each one of us.</i>

1309
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,375
<i>I kiss you in the wind, Mateo.</i>

1310
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:17,544
<i>I kiss you in the breeze.</i>

1311
01:50:20,013 --> 01:50:22,882
<i>I kiss you when the sun rises,
and when the night falls...</i>

1312
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,318
<i>in the waves of the sea...</i>

1313
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:29,055
<i>in the forest's darkness.</i>

1314
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:32,892
<i>I kiss you today
and always, Mateo...</i>

1315
01:50:33,326 --> 01:50:35,929
<i>as we invent our way to love.</i>

1316
