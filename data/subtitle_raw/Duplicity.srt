Pierre ! Pierre !

18
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,658
What are you doing?
It's all wet.

19
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,610
Look, it's all wet.

20
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,694
Come on, get out.

21
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Come on, get out of the tub.

22
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,971
- There. Did you wash your hair?
- Yes.

23
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,280
Good.

24
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,612
- Let's play, Dad?
- Later..

25
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,662
First pass through the dryer.

26
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,612
You're hurting me !

27
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,912
Ah, I'm sorry.

28
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,083
- We dress to see Mom ?
- Yes.

29
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,408
Easy, son !
You scared me !

30
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,286
We must be careful
with the baby.

31
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,241
Come out, little baby.

32
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,304
Soon it will come out of hiding.

33
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,730
Come near, my loves.

34
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,077
Did you see what has drawn Pierre ?

35
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,281
My mom is dead.

36
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:56,474
My mom is dead
Here, now.

37
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,129
- Was she alive?
- Look.

38
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:28,311
- Please.
- Thank you.

39
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,381
Morning.

40
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:44,630
Come in.

41
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:57,941
Morning.

42
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,634
Morning.

43
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:09,723
Thomas Dussart, Matyas Hebert.
Please have a seat.

44
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:24,087
I understand your commmotion.

45
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,681
But...

46
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,723
let's get to the facts.

47
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:34,225
Before dying,
your mother revealed your existence...

48
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,426
to Thomas Dussart,
your brother here present.

49
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,134
When she died,
I did a search for heirs.

50
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,883
It took a few months to find you,

51
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:49,656
reason was your name change
and custody of Child Services.

52
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,827
At death, Mrs. Depierpont-Dussart
was the proprietor of two bank accounts ...

53
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,225
I then urge you to sign
the tax return succession.

54
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:36,850
- I wish good luck to you both.
- Thank you.

55
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:54,321
How is it possible?

56
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:57,591
Shortly before her death,
mom told me you were alive.

57
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,897
It was a great shock.

58
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,310
They always told me you died
in a car accident, at age 6.

59
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,060
I don't know why they lied.

60
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:10,998
- I thought they were dead.
- You mean...

61
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:13,908
You don't remember anything?

62
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,054
No.

63
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:26,068
Don't you remember me ?
What about us, the house ?

64
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:46,736
- Don't you remember anything ?
- Nothing.

65
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:51,439
Listen, I...

66
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:56,974
I have to go pick up my wife
at the airport.

67
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:00,592
I would like to stay, but I can't.
She is very fragile right now...

68
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:04,022
- Wait. You can't leave me like this.
- Hey...

69
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:06,769
I can't do anything else.

70
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,536
Now that we've found each other,
we will not separate, I promised.

71
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,938
But I really must go.
I'll call around.

72
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:18,958
- Did you know I exist ?
- I'll call you back, promise.

73
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:21,717
If she was alive,
why did she leave me alone ?

74
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:23,221
I don't know !

75
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,706
I don't know.
They never spoke about you.

76
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:30,644
- I promise I'll call you.
- I don't even know where to find you !

77
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,579
- Wait, you can not walk away.
- I'll call you, trust me.

78
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,638
- We need to talk.
- I swear I'll call you. I swear.

79
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,348
Matyas!

80
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,361
Been so long !
How are you doing ?

81
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:24,463
Why did'nt you tell me
my mother was alive ?

82
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,576
How funny you should ask me that now.

83
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,142
Usually everyone else wanted to know,
but you never asked anything.

84
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,441
- So you knew it ?
- No, I didn't.

85
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:36,142
- That can't be. You must have known it.
- I never know anything.

86
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:48,213
- If you knew something, you'd tell me ?
- Matyas, I know the same as you, I promise.

87
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,706
I have no access to records.

88
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:54,700
A social worker brought you here,
that's all, I'm sorry.

89
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,386
- Just tell the truth.
- Matyas !

90
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:45,134
Don't worry,
he said he'd call you.

91
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,165
You tried to call the notary again ?

92
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:56,851
Always the answering machine,
and there's no Thomas Dussart on the list.

93
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:06,830
You maybe remember, now.

94
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,802
After a concussion,
some say memory returns.

95
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:14,572
Claire, I don't even
remember my dreams.

96
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:21,427
- You may not want to remember.
- <i> Dad ! </i>

97
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,586
Dad !

98
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:29,356
- Dad !
- I'm here, what's wrong ?

99
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:36,425
- Why'd you yell, son ?
- I saw you down there, Dad.

100
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,361
- Thomas ?
- No.

101
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,012
No. It's me.

102
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,012
I can't sleep.

103
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:00,625
TWINS DISORDERS
IN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS

104
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,707
FRAGILE BALANCE OF THE FATHER-MOTHER -
PAIR OF "TWIN" FAMILY

105
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,713
Easy.

106
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,026
I feel like doing it.

107
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:43,439
- Wait.
- Easy.

108
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,414
Not now.

109
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,516
Here we go.

110
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,064
Thank you, Sylvain.

111
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,671
Next.

112
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,291
Children, please.

113
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,325
Jeanne, I would like you to smile, please.

114
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,807
Try to improve, will you?

115
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,646
Hush kids, I need quiet
or there won't be enough time for all.

116
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,278
Try to smile, come on.

117
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,664
I only ask you to smile.
It is important for the picture.

118
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,851
- I'm glad to see you.
- So am I.

119
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,661
- Can I come in?
- Sure. How'd you find me ?

120
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:48,040
I called your wife.
She gave me the lab's address.

121
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:54,030
- Have you changed your hairstyle ?
- Yeah I like this one.

122
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,231
Come in.

123
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:11,083
I make a living photographing
children. Well, for now.

124
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,806
- Me too.
- Is that true ?

125
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,796
Actually, I work in a hospital
I do scans.

126
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,268
- How funny.
- Yes.

127
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:24,525
- Is this your son?
- Yes.

128
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,345
That's awesome !

129
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:29,194
There's a resemblance.
Look.

130
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,952
You're there.

131
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:35,529
- Can I keep it?
- Sure you can.

132
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,122
It's yours.

133
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,617
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.

134
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,372
She's nice.

135
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,661
My wife's like us:
She has a twin sister.

136
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,356
Unfortunately, Elina can't have children.

137
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:56,454
- How are you both doing ?
- Good.

138
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,886
I mean in the sexual aspect.

139
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,431
It must be difficult right now, right ?

140
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:07,207
Matyas,
you and I feel the same things.

141
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:10,188
You gotta get used to it .
We are the same.

142
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,058
I'm sure that you like it
as much as I do.

143
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:19,268
The first time I saw Elina
in the hospital, I was attracted.

144
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:23,243
She has an amazing body.
And she always wants to do it.

145
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:27,974
- Don't you want to sit a minute ?
- Whatever.

146
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,155
Shit !

147
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,030
Matyas ! Matyas !

148
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,711
What is it ?
Are you okay ?

149
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:03,430
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
- Let me see.

150
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:05,380
Don't look.

151
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,737
- Do I bleed a lot ?
- Don't worry, it's nothing.

152
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,617
It's just a piece of glass.

153
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,787
There, it was nothing.

154
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:21,381
Take it easy.
That's it.

155
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,108
Matyas !

156
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,189
Sit down.
Are you okay ?

157
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,218
I'm dizzy.

158
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:31,849
Relax.

159
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,642
That will be okay
Breathe slowly.

160
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:41,959
How will you do with childbirth ?

161
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:45,698
I promised Claire I would try,
but I don't know if I'll make it.

162
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,260
I understand.

163
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,375
The smell of blood ...

164
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:51,686
Cries ...

165
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,569
I think I wouldn't make it either.

166
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:56,042
Thomas.

167
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,854
You have to help me
understand what happened.

168
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,875
That's why I'm here.

169
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:10,275
- Do you remember us before ?
- Of course.

170
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,867
We were very close.

171
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,944
<i>Inseparable.</i>

172
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,391
<i>And one day, you disappeared.</i>

173
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,974
<i>it was just like removing
a part of myself.</i>

174
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:44,770
<i>A cut-off.</i>

175
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:59,270
I'd like you to come to my place
this afternoon, around five.

176
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:02,066
I want to show you some of our
childhood pictures.

177
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:02,866
Okay.

178
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:04,995
From now on, we won't separate.

179
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,449
Thomas ?

180
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,561
Thomas ?

181
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:16,448
Thomas ?

182
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:38,697
MRS. DEPIERPONT-DUSSART.

183
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:40,231
BEGUINAGES REST HOME
CANAL STREET, 12 A - 1000 BRUSSELS

184
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,110
Thomas ?

185
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:32,646
Thomas ?

186
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,471
Is that you ?

187
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:40,864
Thomas !

188
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,624
Don't go, please.

189
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,037
Wait a second.

190
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,607
You're wrong,
I'm Thomas's brother.

191
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,230
It was open, I came in.
I'm so sorry.

192
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,847
- God, what've I done !
- Sorry, my fault.

193
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:01,470
I thought it was Thomas.
I didn't mean to...

194
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:04,160
Go away, if Thomas see us,
he'll get irritated

195
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,368
- We agreed to see !
- Go, hurry !

196
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,976
I should have meet him now !

197
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,006
Morning.

198
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,399
- Permit. Why are you here?
- Good afternoon. I...

199
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,125
I'm looking for...

200
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:29,216
Mrs. Dussart's room.
I was told it was on this floor.

201
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:33,954
- You know she's dead ?
- Yes, but I wonder if...

202
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,354
by chance there was some object left...

203
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,492
Mrs. Dussart's daughter
took everything.

204
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,871
- Her step-daughter, you mean.
- Yes, Mrs Elina.

205
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:54,690
Excuse the question:
do you recognize me ?

206
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,007
I'm Mrs. Dussart's son.

207
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,547
- Don't you recognize me ?
- No.

208
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,746
Thank you.

209
00:29:17,094 --> 00:29:18,654
- Bye.
- Daddy !

210
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:23,297
- Have you seen my plane ?
- Later, sonny.

211
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,456
Your brother came to see us.

212
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,205
What did he want ?

213
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,629
To apologize for failing
to attend the appointment.

214
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:49,342
He liked that you had met his wife
He's invited you to his place tonight.

215
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,264
- How is she ?
- Who ?

216
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,868
His wife.

217
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:55,456
Barely saw her.

218
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,659
- Is everything all right ?
- Yeah.

219
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,152
- What about him ?
- Your brother ?

220
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,876
He's very nice.

221
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:08,219
But he is less handsome,
smart and charming as you are.

222
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:12,703
- How could you recognize him ?
- There was no need.

223
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:16,162
- He immediately asked for you.
- So you knew it was not me?

224
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:20,123
How could you doubt ?
I'm sure to recognize you, first sight.

225
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:25,308
I'd never confuse. I feel for you.
It is not because he looks like you that...

226
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:29,698
- Did he touch you ?
- Why do you ask ?

227
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:33,215
- Did I asked if you touched his wife?
- Sorry.

228
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,331
You haven't even told me
what she looks like.

229
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:41,312
She's less pretty, smart and sweet
than you are. Now, did he touch you ?

230
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,736
Matyas, leave.
He was playing with Pierre an hour.

231
00:30:44,932 --> 00:30:46,939
You can see he likes children.
He's a very sweet person.

232
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,416
That's good.

233
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:03,193
What is that ?

234
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,808
Did I already prohibit you
to play with guns?

235
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:10,908
- What is this ?
- Calm, Matyas. It's a plastic toy.

236
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,404
It's a weapon.

237
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:16,571
- We shouldn't give weapons to children.
- It ain't me.

238
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,841
But your brother.

239
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:37,018
Matyas !
Where are you going?

240
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:41,502
Wait, Matyas!
Stay with me, please.

241
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,040
Stay !

242
00:31:57,891 --> 00:31:58,971
Matyas!

243
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:02,040
I don't like when you go to
my place when I'm not.

244
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,054
You came as well.

245
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:09,371
But I did not pretend to be you.
Doesn't matter.

246
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,231
Come.

247
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:14,265
Come in.

248
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,469
- Why didn't you ever visit mom ?
- What for ? She'd never recognize me.

249
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,321
Come in, I've prepared a surprise.

250
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:25,856
Come.

251
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:33,212
Come in, don't be shy.
Please.

252
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:36,316
I want to introduce my brother Matyas,

253
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,898
who honors us by being present tonight.

254
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:54,201
Since some time ago,
we met to share our experiences.

255
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,433
I am very happy to have you with us.

256
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,835
Come, let me introduce.

257
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:05,629
Celine, Carine,
this is my brother Matyas.

258
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,515
- Hello, Matyas.
- Hello, Matyas.

259
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:11,128
- Thomas talks much about you.
- Thomas talks much about you.

260
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,075
Shall we go on ?

261
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:19,738
These are Fabrice and Patrice...

262
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,552
Laurence and Florence...

263
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:26,167
Marc and Luc, Marie and Sophie...

264
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:29,632
Arnaud and Benjamin,
Pierre-François and François-Louis...

265
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:31,359
and Jean-Pierre,

266
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:35,195
who has spent several years
looking for his brother.

267
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:39,165
Well, I've introduced everyone.

268
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:42,623
Matyas ?

269
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:47,291
Matyas wait.
You can't deny this moment.

270
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,584
I have prepared a surprise
that could...

271
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,921
that could help you to remember.

272
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:57,150
Okay.

273
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:03,098
Jean-Paul, would you help me?
Dear friends !

274
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,531
I hope you enjoy the movie.

275
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,497
It's a movie about...

276
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:13,724
developing a very interesting
theory regarding the twinship.

277
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,295
I'll let you watch it.

278
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:20,377
<i>Some experiences were conducted
with "mirror-twins".</i>

279
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,674
<i>We name monozygotic twins that way</i>

280
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:27,645
<i>because they're perfectly symmetrical,
just like in a mirror.</i>

281
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,672
<i>Case of twins Lionel and Jonathan
that suffer identity troubles,</i>

282
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,781
<i>was analyzed by sicentists..</i>

283
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:38,008
<i>Jonathan incorporated
his brother's image as himself.</i>

284
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:42,270
<i> When seeing his brother,
he feels like he's seeing himself.</i>

285
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:47,222
<i>So, while looking in a mirror,
he thinks he sees his brother.</i>

286
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:53,212
<i> In order to understand the
melting intensity between twins,</i>

287
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:56,700
<i>researchers focused on
their intrauterine life.</i>

288
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,546
<i> - They discovered that 80 %...</i>
- I was like you.

289
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,225
I lost my brother.

290
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:06,455
You're lucky, you know.

291
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:10,942
You'll never have anyone
so close to you.

292
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,728
<i>...just like being soaked up
by his brother.</i>

293
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:23,321
<i> From the lost twin,
remains only a shadow fetus,</i>

294
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,912
<i>a dry paper.</i>

295
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:32,155
<i>Some scientists argue that
fetuses struggle for their own life.</i>

296
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:37,654
<i>If twins are born,
this means they survived the battle...</i>

297
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,188
<i> and their strength
is absolutely equal.</i>

298
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:43,188
<i>We can consider them
as a perfect couple, although...</i>

299
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:02,322
Matyas, if you look for Elina
she's not there.

300
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:05,139
These meetings make her sad.

301
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,643
She rarely sees her twin sister.

302
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,972
Good !
So you found dad's picture ?

303
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:14,937
Keep it if you wish.
I have more recent ones.

304
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:20,763
- You mean he's still alive ?
- Sure, it's not because mom died...

305
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:23,445
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Matyas...

306
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:26,967
To him, you died at age of 6.

307
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:30,325
Thomas, stop playing with me.

308
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,279
I play no games.

309
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:37,271
- I need to know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

310
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:43,378
I don't know, I swear.
Anyway, I haven't seen him for years.

311
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:48,886
Okay.

312
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:51,386
Wait, Matyas.

313
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,817
I wanted to say, about that delivery...

314
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,697
- It seems very important to Claire.
- Claire told you about that ?

315
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,347
I just want you to know that...

316
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:08,435
if it's too hard for you,
I can go in your place.

317
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,944
You can't be serious.

318
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,809
No.

319
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,526
What are you doing ?

320
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,512
- Why are you looking at me that way ?
- Nothing.

321
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,737
I was worried.

322
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:07,415
Sorry.

323
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:15,735
Put your hand on my belly, please.

324
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:23,987
- Matyas ?
- I've been thinking.

325
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,607
I decided to attend the delivery.

326
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,307
- Really ?
- Yes.

327
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:58,484
Sir ?

328
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,297
- Yes ?
- Where are you going?

329
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:04,245
Looking for a girl who just entered.

330
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:08,085
It's important, I need  to talk to her.
Her name is Elina Dussart.

331
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:11,281
- About what ?
- Private.

332
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:13,583
She's my wife.

333
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:22,481
Elina ?
Your husband is at the reception desk

334
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:26,965
She's waiting for you. Room 22.

335
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,462
- Middle of hall, left.
- Thank you.

336
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,917
<i>Thomas ?</i>

337
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:52,653
No, this isn't Thomas.

338
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:55,502
Matyas ?

339
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:57,229
Come in.

340
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,136
Elina...

341
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:09,168
Why do you hide ?

342
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:16,685
Oh my God !
Thomas did that ?

343
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:20,432
I hit the closet door. Stupid.

344
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:24,308
Don't be ashamed, Elina.
You can't accept that.

345
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:27,539
He's jealous of you.

346
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,403
- Why ?
- He said you've done him a lot of damage.

347
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,417
Damage ? I don't understand.

348
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,238
What I've done to him ?

349
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:42,896
- I did nothing to him.
- I don't know, I don't know.

350
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,508
Since he found you out,
he's changed. He became mad.

351
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,484
- Why are you still with him ?
- I got him under my skin,

352
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:55,282
within my blood. Before him,
I didn't know what love was.

353
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,547
Can I trust you ?

354
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:04,790
Yes.

355
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:09,041
I need my father's address.
Can you tell me where he lives ?

356
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,015
Yes.

357
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:22,802
You're dead.

358
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:26,704
Don't you remember ?
You're dead. Dead !

359
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,265
Shit !

360
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:07,822
- Matyas.
- What are you doing here?

361
00:47:12,402 --> 00:47:14,377
Pierre, what are you afraid of?

362
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:16,039
Pierre, is your dad.

363
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:19,438
I already explained that Uncle Thomas's
twin brother is dad.

364
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:29,232
- I thought it'd be good to meet all.
- You're right. A great idea.

365
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:33,356
- Your wife didn't come ?
- She couldn't.

366
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:35,560
She apologizes.

367
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:40,584
Things right now are quite....rough.

368
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:43,119
Anyway, she's quite shy.
Almost never goes out.

369
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,484
- Does'nt she have friends?
- Yes, one.

370
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:49,039
Well, two now.

371
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:02,731
- I had better go.
- There's no reason why. Stay.

372
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,205
You lied to me.

373
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:07,784
- You knew where he lived.
- I knew he didn't want to see you.

374
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,868
Can you tell me what you're talking about ?

375
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:11,625
- About our father.
- About our father.

376
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:15,336
- He's still alive?
- Place was filled with your wife's pictures.

377
00:48:15,536 --> 00:48:16,649
Did he let you come in ?

378
00:48:16,848 --> 00:48:19,336
Damn, Thomas !
Place was filled with your wife's pictures !

379
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:25,004
Dad cherished Elina.

380
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:28,045
Maybe too much.

381
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,471
Thank you, Claire,
thank you so much.

382
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:38,122
- I gotta go, kid.
- Don't you want to stay and play with me ?

383
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,844
Of course he stays.

384
00:48:42,288 --> 00:48:44,710
Matyas, tell him to stay.

385
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,335
You stay, I'm leaving.

386
00:48:47,536 --> 00:48:49,227
- Where are you going ?
- For a walk.

387
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:52,970
- I'll come with you.
- Impossible. I run.

388
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,467
So do I.

389
00:48:58,448 --> 00:49:02,223
- You plan to go dressed this way ?
- Lend him a sweatsuit.

390
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:07,791
You've got a wonderful woman.
I envy you, you know.

391
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:11,630
Elina is so complicated.

392
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,909
- Wanna stop?
- Why ? You tired ?

393
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:47,364
Matyas ?

394
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:50,797
Won't you help me?

395
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:11,148
You don't play with me anymore ?

396
00:50:20,846 --> 00:50:22,668
You don't play with me anymore ?

397
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:33,706
You don't play with me anymore...

398
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:46,980
Are you okay ?

399
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,896
He's dying !
We have to revive him, quick !

400
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,655
No, he breathes  !

401
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:06,472
He breathes !
He's alive ! Alive !

402
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:09,484
He laughs ! He's alive !

403
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:16,201
Come, Matyas.

404
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:24,808
- What about arm wrestling ?
- Okay  !

405
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:26,347
Let's go !!

406
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,292
He's too strong !

407
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,257
- I won !
- You're the strongest.

408
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,768
Wanna do arm wrestling with me ?

409
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:43,619
No, thanks.

410
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:48,364
You owe me that.
You owe me a return match.

411
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:50,027
I don't feel like it.

412
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:54,373
What do you think about, Pierre ?
Anyway, your dad's the strongest, right ?

413
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:56,331
Come on, Dad !

414
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:04,036
Don't worry, Claire.
He always was the best.

415
00:52:04,364 --> 00:52:08,292
I don't think it's a good idea.
And Matyas doesn't like playing.

416
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:13,539
Okay.

417
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:22,916
You loved fighting with me,
remember ?

418
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:25,352
- Can we start ?
- Yes.

419
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,893
Stop it, it's not funny.

420
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:48,450
Bravo !

421
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:50,986
Bravo who ?

422
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,763
Bravo who ?

423
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:56,745
Enough.

424
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,042
Come to bed.

425
00:53:04,235 --> 00:53:06,439
- Say good night.
- Goodnight.

426
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:09,859
Good evening, Pierre.
Sleep well.

427
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:17,095
Don't worry,
he'll always know who his father is.

428
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:20,384
Matyas ?

429
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:23,651
What are you afraid of ?

430
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:27,466
Excuse me ?

431
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:31,210
- Can I say goodnight to Pierre ?
- Sure.

432
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:39,879
It's not that simple
for your father nowadays, you know ?

433
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:42,886
He's kind of lost.

434
00:53:44,331 --> 00:53:47,626
Maybe I'm wrong,
but I think he's afraid...

435
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,822
...I usurp his place.

436
00:53:51,242 --> 00:53:55,552
But there's one thing I'm sure:
He'll always love you.

437
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,812
- You'll come again to play with me ?
- Sure.

438
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,905
- If your mother will let us.
- Of course.

439
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:07,236
Tell me again the story
of Elina and Regina.

440
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:12,423
No, no. I can see your intents.

441
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:16,515
It's bedtime now.
You need to sleep.

442
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:20,613
Baby's also need to sleep.

443
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:24,292
He needs to rest.

444
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,305
You've got to be sweet with the baby.

445
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:33,311
You've got to be sweet with your mom.
She needs it right now.

446
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:42,822
Come and say goodnight to your child.

447
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:49,760
Claire, this is what I'm doing
the last five minutes.

448
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:25,217
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

449
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:28,455
I never could have done such a thing...

450
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:31,492
Good evening, Claire.
Thank you.

451
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:40,455
Matyas, open.
I want to talk with you.

452
00:55:40,649 --> 00:55:41,958
Busy.

453
00:55:42,153 --> 00:55:45,152
What did you play ?
What you did was horrible.

454
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,663
- I did what you let me do.
- How can you say that ?

455
00:55:54,152 --> 00:55:55,712
Matyas, stop running away.

456
00:55:55,913 --> 00:55:58,662
You thought I was him.
You're not able to recognize me.

457
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:02,598
Of course I am ! You've played with me !
You betrayed me !

458
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,475
- It was the only way to know.
- Know what ?

459
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,248
- He stroked your belly, and you liked it.
- The baby ! He stroked the baby !

460
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:12,671
- But you liked it.
- Naturally !

461
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:16,003
Of course, I wish you'd behave
this way with me and Pierre.

462
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:18,951
See?

463
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:24,869
That's all you want
me to be with you.

464
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:26,882
You don't understand anything.

465
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,855
I wish you could be like this.
You could, if you would.

466
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,829
You can also if you wanted,

467
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:38,081
ask him to attend
the delivery in my place.

468
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,543
How can you say that ?
How cruel !

469
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:45,727
- Now stop it.
- Now you stop it.

470
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:48,830
- Matyas, have you gone mad ?
- Stop laughing at me all of you !

471
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,878
- The baby, stop !.
- Mom ! Mom !

472
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,522
- Mom !
- It's all right, dear.

473
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:59,068
Go back to your room. It's over.
Dad won't be angry anymore.

474
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:01,377
I'm going to talk a minute
with him and I'll go see you.

475
00:57:10,823 --> 00:57:14,205
- How could you raise your hand ?
- I didn't.

476
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:19,776
- Don't do it ever again.
- Claire, you know me.

477
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:22,559
I never could.

478
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:26,116
- You almost did.
- But I didn't.

479
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,285
I did nothing.

480
00:58:05,894 --> 00:58:07,749
How did you find me ?

481
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:10,245
Claire.

482
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:14,529
- Did you see her ?
- She just told me where to find you.

483
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:19,520
- He hit you again..
- He was crazy.

484
00:58:19,717 --> 00:58:22,587
I could escape with his car.

485
00:58:23,174 --> 00:58:25,061
I'm afraid he'll find me.

486
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:29,919
I don't know where to go.
Help me, please.

487
00:58:30,118 --> 00:58:33,347
- If you wish, you can stay here.
- Hold me.

488
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:39,714
I know how to help you
recover your memory.

489
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:45,890
- You must return to the house you raised in.
- You know where it is ?

490
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,053
I can give you the address,
if you want.

491
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:51,554
Here it is.

492
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:56,864
Take me in your arms.

493
00:59:01,381 --> 00:59:04,697
No I can't.
I can't do this.

494
00:59:05,444 --> 00:59:07,616
But your body wants it.

495
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:11,067
Be bad.

496
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:27,097
It'll be fine...

497
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:30,528
It'll be fine...don't worry.

498
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:33,185
- It will pass me.
- I'm sorry.

499
00:59:36,932 --> 00:59:38,819
Let me do it.

500
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:46,336
No...

501
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,181
No, I don't want...

502
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:40,378
- What happened ?
- I had a nightmare.

503
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:44,034
- You made much noise.
- Sorry.

504
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:54,044
Matyas ?
What are you doing there ?

505
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:00,000
I need help.

506
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:11,138
Come on.
Come with me, kid.

507
01:01:20,387 --> 01:01:22,427
Can I ask you a question?

508
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:26,366
You always said you loved your life before.
Before everything.

509
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:27,806
Yes, of course.

510
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:33,310
I love Claire, my son,
I like my job...

511
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:36,605
- Never felt the need to remember ?
- No.

512
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:39,104
- But you were happy ?
- I think so.

513
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:41,309
Are you happy today ?

514
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:45,692
Don't you see what you're doing ?

515
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:51,073
Open your eyes, damn it.
It's no time to worry about the past. Wake up.

516
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:54,423
Claire needs you now.

517
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:59,707
Go back home, take care of her.
I'm sure you're expected.

518
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:00,893
Pierre ?

519
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:02,843
What happened ?

520
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,325
Pierre !

521
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:12,380
What is happening ?

522
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,476
- Claire ?
- Leave us alone.

523
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:18,590
Claire, what happened ?

524
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:21,653
Open !

525
01:03:21,857 --> 01:03:23,286
Open !

526
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:30,585
- What happened ?
- Go away.

527
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:32,246
Thomas did that, right ?

528
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,446
Thomas did that ?
And that too ?

529
01:03:38,912 --> 01:03:40,635
You think it was me ?

530
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,953
You think I did it?
No, no...

531
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,854
I was in the lab,
with his wife.

532
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:53,526
- She called you, you gave him the address.
- I never spoke to her.

533
01:03:53,728 --> 01:03:55,386
- But yes !
- Never.

534
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,045
Impossible !

535
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,326
Bad !

536
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,693
No.

537
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,421
- It was him. He's crazy.
- You make me afraid, Matyas.

538
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:09,821
- Claire, please believe me.
- Don't touch me !

539
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:20,600
- I was with his wife in the lab ...
- Stop it.

540
01:04:29,662 --> 01:04:32,051
I'll call a doctor,
You can't stay like this.

541
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,662
I've already called one.

542
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:39,868
Go away.

543
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,471
I'll find this out,
and I'll come back.

544
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:51,997
Thomas !

545
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:04,292
Thomas ?.

546
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:25,222
Thomas !

547
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:56,636
Cover up !
Aren't you ashamed ?

548
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:01,628
Cover up ! To me you're dead.
I don't want to see you, ever.

549
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:09,917
Mom !

550
01:09:12,004 --> 01:09:13,248
Thomas !

551
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:38,329
<i> Matyas !</i>

552
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:08,060
Hello, brother.

553
01:11:09,282 --> 01:11:10,689
Thomas ?

554
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:14,969
- Mom !
- Thomas !

555
01:11:15,362 --> 01:11:17,947
- Mom !
- Thomas ! My baby !

556
01:11:18,145 --> 01:11:20,414
- Mom !
- My baby !

557
01:12:54,176 --> 01:12:56,281
Do you remember now ?

558
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:05,944
Don't look at me like that.

559
01:13:06,975 --> 01:13:08,568
You know waht ?

560
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:12,825
I never felt as good as when
I decided to be a woman.

561
01:13:21,823 --> 01:13:23,929
Until the day that I found you.

562
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:31,773
I want you to know that you've got
an adorable child and a wonderful woman.

563
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:37,556
I'm sure she'll have a girl.

564
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:40,726
Pierre will be happy.
He told me he wanted a sister.

565
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,434
Girls are much nicer children.

566
01:13:51,102 --> 01:13:53,306
You don't know how lucky you are.

567
01:13:54,815 --> 01:13:59,157
You don't deserve them.
You don't even know what love is.

568
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,741
Have you thought about Claire ?

569
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:06,901
She'll be hurt when she knows
what you've done to Elina.

570
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:09,722
You're a monster.

571
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:20,467
Now you sleep.
To take to the lead.

572
01:14:20,766 --> 01:14:22,937
But when you wake up, rush.

573
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,267
Otherwise,
there will be great trouble.

574
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,660
I'll count to 10.

575
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,259
One..

576
01:14:32,925 --> 01:14:34,235
Two...

577
01:14:38,494 --> 01:14:39,988
Three...

578
01:15:05,758 --> 01:15:07,219
<i>Four...</i>

579
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:29,142
<i>Five...</i>

580
01:15:29,885 --> 01:15:31,445
Breathe slowly.

581
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:36,854
Claire !

582
01:15:37,052 --> 01:15:38,100
Claire !

583
01:15:38,429 --> 01:15:39,639
Claire !

584
01:15:45,117 --> 01:15:47,986
His wife has contractions.
She's gone to the hospital.

585
01:15:48,637 --> 01:15:51,353
No, no...

586
01:15:54,428 --> 01:15:57,592
Please, I'm looking for Claire Hebert.
She's giving birth.

587
01:15:57,788 --> 01:15:59,447
- And you're...?
- Her husband.

588
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:01,240
One moment, please.

589
01:16:01,437 --> 01:16:03,858
- Any problem ?
- Not at all. Just a moment.

590
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:10,871
Sir !

591
01:16:40,955 --> 01:16:42,232
Claire ?

592
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:44,369
Claire, it's me, Matyas.

593
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:47,483
Claire, are you okay ?

594
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:51,381
How did it go ?

595
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:54,422
How is the baby ?

596
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:57,718
He almost died, Matyas,
because of punches.

597
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,345
No.

598
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:07,830
Where is Pierre ?
Tell me where Pierre is.

599
01:17:08,731 --> 01:17:10,040
In a safe place.

600
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:11,217
<i>Six...</i>

601
01:17:12,155 --> 01:17:14,970
Claire,
didn't you entrust him to Thomas ?

602
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:19,505
Claire, tell me you didn't intrust
him to Thomas ?

603
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:20,505
It's important.
Where are they?

604
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:23,863
What for ?
So you can hurt them again ?

605
01:17:24,795 --> 01:17:25,842
Sir.

606
01:17:26,043 --> 01:17:27,952
- Tell me where they are.
- Sir, come with us.

607
01:17:28,154 --> 01:17:30,423
- Claire, where are they ?
- Come on, sir.

608
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:32,178
Claire !
Let me !

609
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,634
Let me go !
Let me go !

610
01:17:37,306 --> 01:17:38,681
Let me go !

611
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,620
Thomas !

612
01:17:55,098 --> 01:17:56,375
Thomas !

613
01:17:59,322 --> 01:18:00,402
Thomas !

614
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:03,599
My little girl...

615
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:06,037
Why are you still getting
dressed like that?

616
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:15,128
Aren't you well ?

617
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:18,712
You want to talk ?

618
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:23,377
Is that why you called me ?

619
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:27,761
You want to talk, finally ?

620
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:31,510
Thomas ?

621
01:19:41,752 --> 01:19:43,694
You made the best choice, you know

622
01:19:44,984 --> 01:19:49,741
Girls are nicer than boys.

623
01:19:51,736 --> 01:19:56,624
You were so quiet. You played for hours
with your dolls in your bedroom

624
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:05,142
<i>Seven...</i>

625
01:20:47,415 --> 01:20:48,876
Thomas ?

626
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:53,201
Thomas,
give me back my son.

627
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:54,576
Give him back to me.

628
01:20:54,775 --> 01:20:58,834
- Don't worry, he's okay.
- He has nothing to do with this.

629
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,526
I just wanted him
to know who you really are.

630
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:04,526
I swear, if you've done anything...

631
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,234
Pierre !

632
01:22:32,277 --> 01:22:33,586
<i>Eight...</i>

633
01:23:17,973 --> 01:23:19,947
Pierre, can you hear me ?

634
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,416
Are you okay, son ?

635
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:32,178
It's over, now.
Do you understand ? It's over.

636
01:23:36,019 --> 01:23:40,656
I'll be right back. Don't go.
I'll be right back. Everything will be fine.

637
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:27,496
<i>Nine...</i>

638
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,930
Sweetheart.

639
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:33,867
Matyas couldn't find you ?

640
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:41,286
No.

641
01:26:43,505 --> 01:26:45,872
I would never forgive him.

642
01:27:08,976 --> 01:27:10,602
Uncle Thomas...

643
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:14,375
- You come to play ?
- I'm coming, kid.

644
01:27:38,607 --> 01:27:39,949
How are you doing?

645
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:43,372
You're doing well.

646
01:27:43,919 --> 01:27:47,531
I'll show you how to curve it.
Look.

647
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:20,617
<i>Ten.</i>
