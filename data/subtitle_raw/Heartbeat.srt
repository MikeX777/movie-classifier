1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,073
THE SCHPOUNTZ

2
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,077
It's always the same thing
and always will be.

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,870
We'll never ever know
who left the basket of croissants

4
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,032
under the tap of the oil can.

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,159
And however much I investigate,
I'll never find the culprit.

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,034
Well I know it wasn't me.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,270
I was at Mass.
It wasn't me either.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,433
Who then?

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,831
Maybe a customer,
who wanted a croissant,

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,389
unwittingly pulled
the croissant basket in such a way

11
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,190
that it ended up
under the tap of the oil can.

12
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,879
Did you have a croissant?

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,032
Sure I had one.
For breakfast, to feed myself.

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,430
- No way!
- What do you mean, no way?

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,195
You eat but you don't feed yourself.
I'm the one who feeds you!

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,749
Your father, my brother,
wouldn't have.

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,388
No one pulled the wool
over his eyes.

18
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,710
- As you often tell me.
- To no avail.

19
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,996
Then why tell me again?

20
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,913
Oh, I know I'm wrong!

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,913
Wrong to think
you'll ever know you must work!

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,548
And that being a grocer
is an honest trade!

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,156
And that a big boy of 25
could help his uncle,

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,757
who houses and feeds him
despite being driven totally nuts!

25
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,879
I know where you're going.
Now you'll call me a good-for-nothing.

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,828
"Good-for-nothing"
would be too good for you!

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,195
You're a terrible-at-everything!

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,999
If you don't understand me,
then I do!

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,914
I do understand you,
and I'm deeply hurt.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,675
See how he is.

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,354
Pulling faces
and not taking in a word.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,636
At least your brother's grateful.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,032
He works in the shop
and realises when we're in trouble.

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,272
He managed to sell that tub
of mouldy anchovies

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,671
to Mr Carbonnières,
which was quite a feat!

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,152
They were so green and bloated,
you'd have taken them for mackerel.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,709
Well, he managed to sell them!

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,359
Is Mr Carbonnières blind?

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,716
I told him they were tropical.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,509
That's thinking
and imagination for you!

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,999
He came up with that.

42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,675
I know very well
what got his imagination working!

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,511
What?

44
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,633
You knew that if you didn't sell them
we'd end up eating them.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,916
Here, on this very table.

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,470
We'd have had tropical anchovies
every single day

47
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,949
until the tub was gone

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,317
and until this fine family's funeral.

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,276
Meaning?

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,999
This liver paste

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,152
is the one customers won't buy
because it's off.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,029
Here it is, with a hint of sourness,
to feed me.

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,033
But I'm not stupid.
I'd rather eat rat poison.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,270
And that roast pork is putrid.

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,318
The only person to eat it
is Mrs Graziani.

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,031
I say "is" today, but tomorrow
maybe I'll have to say "was"!

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,031
After eating it, she went to bed.

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,351
She's probably rolling around
in agony now.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,829
Rest in peace, Mrs Graziani.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,152
Irénée, she's 76
and has a mild dose of indigestion.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,710
She'd need no sense
of sight, smell or taste

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,429
to end up with indigestion
from a heaving lump of meat!

63
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,593
You'll have to tie the rest
to the plate.

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,115
Or it'll walk off during the night.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,156
What rubbish!

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,392
Let him talk, Clarisse.

67
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,199
His exaggeration is proof
of his absurdity.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,558
This meat is excellent
and I woofed it down.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,075
But you're used to it.

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,515
When it comes to food poisoning,

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,274
you're immunised, fortified,
armour-plated.

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,874
He swallows, digests
and distils poison.

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,828
He's a veritable still,
belonging to the Borgias!

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,468
You dare call me a still!

75
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,997
- Irénée, if your uncle gets mad...
- He'll start choking again.

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,119
And that would upset me.
For despite his savage way with me...

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,238
I'm very fond of him.

78
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,835
Hello!
- What do you want?

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,995
Any more of those tropical anchovies?

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,436
- Sorry, we're right out.
- When will you get some in?

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,148
Oh, they take a lot of time.

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,108
In 2 to 3 months,
when they're nice and ripe!

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,749
- Where can I find them?
- Impossible.

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,990
- House speciality.
- Too bad.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,117
Thanks all the same.
Goodbye.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,952
Goodbye to you.

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,717
Well done!
There's a lesson for you!

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,359
Admire his work.

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,353
We've been hit by catastrophe,
by disaster.

90
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,909
50 kilos of anchovies
quietly gone bad.

91
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,552
But he turns disaster
into a house speciality.

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,474
He creates a new fish,
one not even God thought of.

93
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,790
And it becomes a brand new nibble.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,749
Then he was wrong to sell
the whole lot to one grocer.

95
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,672
Because his brand new nibble

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,718
will empty the village
of its population.

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,678
All poisoned by his new fish.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,151
You have to denigrate his initiative!

99
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,835
Well done, Casimir.
Here's 10 francs to buy a treat.

100
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,998
Pay no heed
to this useless idiot's sarcasm.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,878
I could get so angry...

102
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,871
No! You'll start choking.

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,430
I don't mind choking
if it's to correct his rubbish!

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,957
My God! It's unthinkable:
A man who doesn't want to work.

105
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,636
I don't want to work in a grocery!
When I'm in your shop...

106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,270
Not a shop, a store!
How many more times?

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,194
OK. When I'm in your store
between dry fish and wet cheese,

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,793
it makes me queasy.

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,997
Discussing potatoes
with Mrs Leribouchon,

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,516
who always wants a penny off,
doesn't interest me.

111
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,036
- I wasn't born to do that!
- To do what then?

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,158
Another career.
I'm sure I have a gift.

113
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,834
If you have anything,
it's not a gift.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,434
You never buy anything sensible
with your pay.

115
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,388
I mean a natural gift, a born gift,
a gift from God!

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,154
Glad to hear you have
a God-given gift.

117
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,915
Other than your big appetite,
big mouth and laziness,

118
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,355
I do wonder what God gave you.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,318
Talent. Hidden talent.

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,754
Very well hidden!

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,069
I know.

122
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,391
If you break your promise
you'll dishonour yourself.

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,996
I won't tell. I'm just saying
you have hidden talent.

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,673
As I've long known.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,276
And what might this talent bring in?

126
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,873
Millions, of course.

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,031
- Millions of what?
- Francs.

128
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,558
- Now he has delusions of grandeur!
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,598
Do you know how much dry fish
you must sell

130
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,955
to earn a million francs?

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,509
No. And I don't want to know.

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,353
But I know I'll make millions

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,715
because I have a talent.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,991
If he said that, he must be mad.

135
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,197
He's not mad, he's a schpountz.

136
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,349
What's a schpountz?

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,389
Is there a schpountz around?

138
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,314
Yes. The bellboy told me
he looks like Charles Boyer.

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,552
And that if we gave him a chance
to be on screen...

140
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,513
I spoke to the one
in golfing trousers.

141
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,238
He's the director of the film.

142
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,875
Come over here, you idiot.

143
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,398
Have you looked in a mirror?

144
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,314
Potato nose, cauliflower ears,
pigeon toes...

145
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,153
- Is that Charles Boyer?
- My sister told me...

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,834
Go on, clear off!

147
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,954
I hadn't noticed he was an idiot.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,033
Good sir, a schpountz isn't an idiot.

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,795
A schpountz is logical
and lives an ordinary life.

150
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,793
He even has common sense,
except regarding cinema.

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,119
If he thinks he looks like an actor,
he'll believe so for ever.

152
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,149
Play any trick you like,
he won't think you're poking fun.

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,273
Do you meet many?

154
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,788
One or two a day.

155
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,270
If he's not mad,
he must be an idiot.

156
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,078
Not at all.

157
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,355
Come now, Miss...

158
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,557
What's in that bellboy's head?

159
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,678
If there was
the slightest resemblance,

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,718
a single family trait
in common with Mr Boyer,

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,996
a similarity in the voice,

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,197
like mine and Mr Raimu's,
then I'd understand.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,714
But he has nothing.

164
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,589
- Whereas you sound like Raimu.
- They have the self-same voice!

165
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,792
That's why you looked at me so oddly
when we met.

166
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,679
- Because you have Raimu's voice.
- Strikingly so!

167
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,075
I'm not a schpountz?

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,833
Not at all!

169
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,233
It's not just the voice,
but his look,

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,755
his gait, his unabashed kindness...

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,148
Everything!

172
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,598
Not everything. There isn't room.
I have my own personality too.

173
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,308
You could play parts
that he couldn't.

174
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,473
Mr Raimu would agree.

175
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,949
And he would play some parts
better than I.

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,111
- Who knows?
- Exactly.

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,397
And yet it's obvious
he isn't a schpountz.

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,516
I can prove it.

179
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,719
I know you're making a film.
Have I asked for a part in it?

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,394
- Not yet.
- And I never will.

181
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,030
- What if we asked you?
- I'd be forced to refuse.

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,156
Your manager would forbid it?

183
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,599
I don't care about the manager,
but I have my barman's duties.

184
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,797
Earlier you said I had Raimu's voice.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,436
If I look at that
from a personal point of view,

186
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,511
then Mr Raimu has MY voice!

187
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,830
And though it's mine, I can't use it.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,199
Because he acted in public before me
and I wouldn't like to wrong him.

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,032
- Yes, but...
- No buts!

190
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,714
I don't have the right!

191
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,035
Now that's a 1st-class schpountz!

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,918
But we've seen better ones!

193
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,240
You should tell Uncle
about your talent.

194
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,277
He knows nothing about cinema.

195
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,237
He went twice with Auntie.

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,678
The first time he said it was stupid,
the second time he dozed off.

197
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,079
- He went though.
- But he was hardly enthralled.

198
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,475
Can I tell him my talent is acting?

199
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,837
No, Casimir.
No premature revelations!

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,911
No upsetting the honest grocer!

201
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,356
- He might try to discourage you.
- Discourage me?

202
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,474
Don't be silly.

203
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,791
I know I was born
with a gift for acting.

204
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,757
God has given me the chance

205
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,913
to see my name on posters
and up in lights.

206
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,674
And the dollars... The dollars!

207
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,512
Doesn't "dollars" sound pretty?

208
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,274
Once, in a bank window
in Marseilles,

209
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,238
I saw a 100-dollar bill.
It didn't look pretty.

210
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,038
They didn't give it to you!

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,510
You have no English.
Why will they give you dollars?

212
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,753
Because of my acting talent.
The film industry is full of dollars!

213
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,311
<i>For You always talks about it.
So if God sends me my chance...</i>

214
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,708
But how?

215
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,838
I don't know. But He owes me one.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,992
Does God toil away for nothing?

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,277
Would He have given me
this calling, this memory,

218
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,556
this voice, this gait,

219
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,109
this quivering sensitivity,

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,714
to leave me serving gorgonzola?

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,952
No, Casimir.
God isn't mad!

222
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,955
Despite his games of famine,
war, floods and plague,

223
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,237
God is basically someone
with good common sense.

224
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,119
At His age,
I'd be surprised if He didn't.

225
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,953
So I won't go looking for my chance.

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,872
I'll wait for it right here.

227
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,632
- Casimir!
- Yes?

228
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,268
- Are you up?
- No. But I won't be long.

229
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,159
It's only 8 o'clock.
And it's Sunday.

230
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,959
I know, but go down anyway.

231
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,518
- Uncle, are you up?
- No.

232
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,194
Then why torture poor Casimir?

233
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,672
There are cars driving past.
We need someone in the store.

234
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,832
I'll go.
You stay in bed, Casimir.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,356
I'll do the exceptional job
of working on Sunday.

236
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,714
He'll have no reproach.

237
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,713
He wants the store open,
so I'll open it.

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,438
Anyway, I'm starving.

239
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,828
- What's wrong?
- We're running on steam!

240
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
- What will you do?
- Put some water in.

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,839
I'll look for some.

242
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,599
Anyone here?

243
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,319
- Hey, what are you doing?
- The saucepan...

244
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,311
Yes, saucepan to sell.

245
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,153
- Of course...
- More than that it's...

246
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,992
65 francs.

247
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,194
No, look... 6 francs 50.

248
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,470
No, look closer... 65 centimes.

249
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,551
Tinplated top-class steel,

250
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,188
nice shape and practical.
6 francs 50.

251
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,353
The enamel won't crack,
as there is no enamel. 6 francs 50.

252
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,991
- I just want to fill my radiator.
- Which means you have a car.

253
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,833
If so, 6 francs 50 is nothing to you.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,468
I've no change.
Plus it's for the cinema.

255
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,108
- You own a cinema?
- No. I make films.

256
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,716
- You do? Where? When?
- Here. Today.

257
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,110
You make films. I knew it!

258
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,794
I've been expecting you.
I'll help you.

259
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,111
God most definitely isn't mad.

260
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,511
This way.
He isn't mad at all!

261
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,675
Now he's saying God isn't mad.

262
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,593
But he's completely round the twist.

263
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,598
- I'll give you that saucepan.
- You're too kind.

264
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,988
He's lending a saucepan
to some clown

265
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,355
dressed in my grandma's trousers.

266
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,956
This is the first time
I've ever been in a car.

267
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,034
Driver!

268
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,109
Driver!

269
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,552
Take the next left!

270
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,353
Chaps, here you are.

271
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,671
At the Col de Tantoi.
There it is.

272
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,398
It looks a bit funny!

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,118
Well, thank you so much.

274
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,510
My pleasure.
Where are the actors?

275
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,194
- Not here yet.
- So you're not filming yet?

276
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,716
- No. In about 2 or 3 hours time.
- And until then?

277
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,429
We'll play cards and have a bite
until we start.

278
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,715
I see.

279
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,475
If you'll allow,
I'd like to watch the filming.

280
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,108
But now I've shown you the col,

281
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,033
I'll go home and put on my collar!

282
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,955
Madam, gentlemen...

283
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,873
See you later.

284
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,232
This is it. It has to be.

285
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,869
- You doubt me.
- No, I don't.

286
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,679
I doubt the others.
They may not understand.

287
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,239
I'll make them understand.

288
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,870
I showed them the way.
I told them I'd be back.

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,429
This is the chance of a lifetime!

290
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,352
And I'm ready.

291
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,159
I'm in my suit and tie...
No, I'm not!

292
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,278
I'm in my tie,
I've found my moustache.

293
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,194
And the best thing of all:
They've only seen me in my pyjamas!

294
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,114
I'll make an extraordinary entrance.
I'll send them reeling.

295
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,396
- Like lightning.
- How?

296
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,120
With a centre parting.

297
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,198
What will you say?

298
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,078
I plan to be humble
and thus obtain an audition.

299
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,437
- What if they laugh?
- At what?

300
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,717
- You.
- Me?

301
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,311
Irénée, I didn't mean to say...

302
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,233
But you did!
You don't believe in me.

303
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,198
Go, false brother.
I'll look after myself!

304
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,920
I do believe in you.
But not as much as you do.

305
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,514
Meaning?
Spit it out, you renegade!

306
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,750
Things never move so quickly.

307
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,791
It's hardly likely they'll hire you
and make you an immediate star.

308
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,269
You need to plot out a path

309
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,352
and take it one step at a time.

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,432
Napoleon was a sub-lieutenant
from Corsica!

311
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,033
He became Emperor.

312
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,352
You don't become Emperor
one step at a time!

313
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,635
You're right to go.

314
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,314
I'm saying all this
out of friendship.

315
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,313
I don't want you to suffer
a disappointment.

316
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,710
You really are Saturday's Child.

317
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,871
Born under the influence of Saturn.

318
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,554
You're saturnine.
I read it in the paper!

319
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,553
- So what?
- You'll never get anywhere!

320
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,389
You're sad, pessimistic
and dominated by distrust!

321
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,754
Pity for you.

322
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,754
I was born on a Thursday
under the influence of Jupiter.

323
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,473
I can hope for anything.

324
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,632
If I'm told I can't,
I'll carry on hoping anyway.

325
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,756
So leave me to it and shut up.

326
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,593
- Well, frankly...
- Frankly what?

327
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,309
You're a good man but you're baleful.
So shut it, Saturnite!

328
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,118
Take it from a Jupiterite!

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,592
Gentlemen, madam...

330
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,988
Delighted!

331
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,719
And he wasn't pushy!

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,236
- He was too modest.
- He was wrong, very wrong!

333
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,472
This is really nice!

334
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,599
Give me the address of the genius
who tailored that suit!

335
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,035
He's just a lowly tailor.

336
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,193
I'll gladly give you his address,
but it won't help.

337
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,558
Because this suit was conceived
and designed by yours truly!

338
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,472
He's a real all-rounder!

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,314
We should have him
design one for all of us!

340
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,871
What a shame!

341
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,476
What is?

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,949
What a shame that a man like this,

343
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,350
due to family or social commitments,

344
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,909
cannot work in films.

345
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,309
Whenever we find a good one,
we can't have him!

346
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,672
To work in films in what quality?

347
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,512
As an actor, of course.

348
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,832
Looks are important for an actor.

349
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,032
But so too does elegance.

350
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,837
The main thing is sex appeal.

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,958
Well he has a very
sexually appealing voice!

352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,396
It may sound ridiculous,

353
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,511
but I do think I have a bit.

354
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,636
It just needs cultivating.

355
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,438
How charmingly modest!

356
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,830
I'm not modest, sir. I was.

357
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,117
But the day I decided
to become an artiste,

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,032
I sacrificed modesty.

359
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,550
So you'd truly like to be in films?

360
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,268
Not just "like to".

361
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,955
I dream of it, get sick with it,
die with it!

362
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,590
Film is my passion, my folly.

363
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,115
I'd do anything just for a bit part.

364
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,716
Even do it for free.
The first one, at least.

365
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,673
Kids, I have an idea.

366
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,798
I'm surprised
no one else had it first.

367
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,554
- What idea?
- The schpountz.

368
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,069
He's our schpountz!

369
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,754
- Of course!
- What's a schpountz?

370
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,594
The schpountz
is an extraordinary part

371
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,876
in an extraordinary film.

372
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,199
In 5 years, we've found no actor
capable of playing it.

373
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,349
Not one.

374
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,478
- We tried every big star.
- All of them!

375
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,598
None of the greatest screen names
can do it.

376
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,116
It's a male version of Greta Garbo.

377
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
Sir, you scare me a little.

378
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,195
Let's not be hasty. In life,
this chap may be a schpountz.

379
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,998
But on screen?

380
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,590
He'll be even more of a schpountz.

381
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,954
Not sure of that!

382
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,997
That's just my opinion.

383
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,516
Naturally, there'll be tests.
And I may be wrong.

384
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,070
When will we do these tests?

385
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,470
I can do a sound test right now.

386
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,508
Do you know anything by heart?
A poem, a song...

387
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,275
Yes, madam. But I won't
recite a poem or sing a song.

388
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,714
It would be cheating.

389
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,270
For a good poem
would detract from its reciter.

390
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,590
I'll perform something different,

391
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,035
which will be more conclusive.

392
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,919
- He's so interesting!
- Let him start.

393
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,274
Thank you.

394
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,434
I shall recite for you
an article from the Civil Code.

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,431
The shortest and clearest.

396
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,036
Perhaps the most "cutting".

397
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,518
"Those sentenced to death
will lose their heads. "

398
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,673
- That's not very cheerful.
- No, it's not. But it can be.

399
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,912
I will now, having been
so warmly welcomed by you,

400
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,356
give you a complete demonstration
of my modest gift.

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,875
I will, with this simple phrase,

402
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,918
induce diverse feelings inside you.

403
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,152
Everything will be in the expression.

404
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,031
I bet he has some expressions!

405
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,477
Don't jump the gun, sir.
Are you ready?

406
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,514
Absolutely.

407
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,513
Then I shall begin. There.

408
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,153
Fear.

409
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,829
"Those sentenced to death

410
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,873
"will lose their heads. "

411
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,349
Pity.

412
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,877
"Those sentenced to death

413
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,038
"will lose their heads. "

414
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,910
Interrogative and affirmative.

415
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,479
"Those sentenced to death
will lose their heads?"

416
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,996
"Those sentenced to death
WILL lose their heads!"

417
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,549
Good, huh?

418
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,279
Excellent.

419
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,352
Pensive.

420
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,272
"Those sentenced to death...

421
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,278
"lose their heads... "

422
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,749
Keep that expression
and try not to move!

423
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,836
Got it.

424
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,399
Comical.

425
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,069
"Those sentenced to death...

426
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,349
"will lose their heads. "

427
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,598
Ladies and gentlemen, I will sing,
as I have a voice,

428
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,159
a song I wrote

429
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,437
which highlights the two facets
of my humble talent.

430
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,033
- Without music?
- Sir...

431
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,353
when I sing, I hear an orchestra!

432
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,998
<i>Have you noticed that in life
Couples are badly planned?</i>

433
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,199
<i>If immense is the wife
Then small is the husband</i>

434
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,638
<i>Bearded ladies wed beardless men
Fat the thin, thin the fat</i>

435
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,157
<i>A quiet cock loves a noisy hen
I don't understand that</i>

436
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,039
<i>It's odd but when it comes to romance</i>

437
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,078
<i>There never is the perfect balance</i>

438
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,550
<i>Grasping love is hard, I find</i>

439
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,677
<i>For it is often deaf and blind</i>

440
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,755
<i>There's not much to comprehend</i>

441
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,914
<i>Since we all find it in the end</i>

442
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,516
<i>Grasping love is hard, I find</i>

443
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,029
<i>Do you approve of the alley cat
Seeking love with constant mewling?</i>

444
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,359
<i>For hours on end if we did that
We'd find it so entirely gruelling</i>

445
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,957
<i>And dogs are particularly awful
Doing it in the street before our eyes</i>

446
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,511
<i>And it's even worse with a bull
Silly cow, it's no surprise!</i>

447
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,075
<i>Bull and cow, dog and cat</i>

448
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,118
<i>I don't really like all that</i>

449
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,628
<i>Grasping love is hard, I find</i>

450
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,268
<i>For it is often deaf and blind</i>

451
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,192
<i>There's not much to comprehend</i>

452
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,709
<i>Since we all find it in the end</i>

453
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,955
<i>Grasping love is hard, I find</i>

454
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,595
Saucisson, Mme Fenuze,

455
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,194
is the best and the cheapest meat,

456
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,715
as it's the only one with no bone!

457
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,639
That's very true.

458
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,439
It'd be odd, finding a bone
in your saucisson.

459
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,431
Quite hilarious, even.

460
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,671
100 grams, 3 francs 50.

461
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,392
- Uncle, a quick word.
- What, without stopping?

462
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,233
- It's a locution.
- What the hell's that?

463
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,472
You'll find out
as soon as the good lady has left.

464
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,473
Your nephew's polite,
treating me like a beggar!

465
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,189
Tell him I'm a customer.
One who pays in good money!

466
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,910
And we pay you in saucisson:
A currency that never devalues!

467
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,435
- Good day, madam.
- Irénée!

468
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,797
Quiet! It's the greatest day
of my life and yours.

469
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,793
The five cents you make
on that lady's saucisson

470
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,155
shouldn't inspire respect for her.

471
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,595
- Look at this.
- What is it?

472
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,832
If this paper was as heavy
as the gold it's worth,

473
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,594
- it would break the scale.
- What is it?

474
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,069
A contract.
A contract for my talent.

475
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,038
Hand me my glasses.

476
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,271
No. I'll read it myself.

477
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,749
But within the family circle...

478
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,999
A family suddenly enriched
by my talent.

479
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,550
Uncle, Casimir, Auntie...

480
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,671
- What's going on?
- Who knows!

481
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,432
- Have you eaten?
- I have.

482
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,955
Sit down.
We'll drink champagne after.

483
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,315
Uncle, do you know the movies?

484
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,994
Yes. A dark room
in which I get bored.

485
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,837
Wrong!

486
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,395
I don't get bored on purpose!

487
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,869
I even get bored getting bored.

488
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,393
But that paper?

489
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,870
Uncle, my god-given gift is movies.

490
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,156
- What?
- Yes. An actor.

491
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,788
Comedy... tragedy...

492
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,956
You like it?

493
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,949
It's best I know
so we know where we are.

494
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,239
A powerful American company
with a subsidiary in France

495
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,551
signed with me this engagement.
Listen.

496
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,508
"Vernickel & Co of Hollywood
and Mr Irénée Fabre... " That's me!

497
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,272
"... agree to the following:

498
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,228
"Mr Irénée Fabre is hired
as an actor for 3 years.

499
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,709
"His first part
will be the schpountz. "

500
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,029
The what?

501
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,918
I'll explain after.

502
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,997
"Mr Irénée Fabre... " Me!

503
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,516
"... will be paid the sum
of 1000 dollars per week. "

504
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,117
Which is 25 to 30 thousand francs.
That's Americans for you!

505
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,549
I knew it!

506
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,229
I bet they didn't pay
a week in advance!

507
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,196
Why?

508
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,113
Because I know Americans.
Anyway, go on.

509
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,557
"If production requirements
force Mr Irénée Fabre... "

510
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,391
Me again!

511
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,519
"... to work in an unknown climate,
from the North Pole to Senegal... "

512
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,956
Uncle, I pause to say
this is surely an exaggeration.

513
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,556
But don't forget
that these are Americans.

514
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,392
They foresee every detail.

515
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,313
Even the North Pole and Senegal!

516
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,157
Normal.

517
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,352
And if it's not normal,
it's dreamable!

518
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,194
They have indemnities for everything!

519
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,916
"Above 30°C in the shade,

520
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,595
"Mr Fabre will receive a bonus
of 100 francs,

521
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,751
"per day and per degree. "

522
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,070
So for 45°C,

523
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,879
I'll be paid
1500 francs extra per day.

524
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,909
45°C is hot!

525
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,192
With 1500 francs he can buy
plenty of fans.

526
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,876
And even afford to be fanned
by the natives.

527
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,235
"Below 0°C, Mr Fabre will receive
a bonus of 200 francs,

528
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,709
"per day and per degree. "

529
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,599
A quick calculation reveals

530
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,558
that minus 40 equals plus 8000!

531
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,996
Simple, logical and only natural.

532
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,351
- I'm totally lost.
- Wait. There are diseases too!

533
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,273
Diseases?
Tell us about the diseases then.

534
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,159
"If a disease is contracted
in a foreign land,

535
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,835
"indemnities are fixed
to the following scale... "

536
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,551
In passing, indemnities are paid
in the currency of the said land.

537
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,757
At first, it seems odd,
if not rather funny.

538
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,639
But on reflection,
it's quite logical.

539
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,872
It's so you can pay for treatment
in the country

540
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,032
where you contract the disease
in local currency.

541
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,679
"The scale...

542
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,431
Frostbitten feet - 4500 roubles.

543
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,633
Yellow fever - 5000 piasters.

544
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,636
Leprosy...

545
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,515
"4000 rupees.

546
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,433
"4...

547
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,710
"Beriberi - 5 elephant tusks.

548
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,190
Seal bite...

549
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,557
"2000 smoked fish. "

550
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,037
Amazing Americans:
Both fantasist and precise!

551
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,238
When they read me this,
I couldn't help laughing.

552
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,836
But the next paragraph
soon calmed me down.

553
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,319
"In case of death,

554
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,233
"funeral rites
and repatriation of the body

555
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,152
"will be paid by the company. "

556
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,629
I can tell you, that cuts...

557
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,389
your laughter.

558
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,669
Well, Uncle?

559
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,839
There is one serious question

560
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,389
I've been asking myself
for a while...

561
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,028
Regarding the contract?

562
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,668
Exactly. May I?

563
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,389
Be my guest.
You've never dealt in millions,

564
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,438
but I do recognise
your business acumen.

565
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,468
So a well posed question

566
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,995
could help to enlighten me.

567
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,596
Not for this contract: It's signed.
But for the next one.

568
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,876
Here's my question...

569
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,190
Are you trying to fool us,

570
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,238
or did they make a fool out of you?

571
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,869
It's good to have a laugh,
but there are limits.

572
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,031
Imagine if he left for Paris!

573
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,395
If he took the train,
he'd get there!

574
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,676
- Then what?
- We don't care.

575
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,149
But he would, once in Paris.

576
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,436
Look, it's hard enough being myself,

577
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,114
without having to wear
another's hat!

578
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,871
But if he's fallen for it,
then we're all responsible.

579
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,792
I feel terrible about being involved.

580
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,473
I wouldn't do it again.

581
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,235
You and your scruples!
You've enough for the lot of us.

582
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,675
If someone loves you,
you don't care.

583
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,231
But a lame duck comes along
and you become totally passionate!

584
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,630
You can turn a nobody
into a somebody.

585
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,631
A real sister of charity.

586
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,590
But don't forget that charity
starts with friends.

587
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,989
Depends on what your friend
is asking!

588
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,639
- You're really leaving?
- Who can stop me?

589
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,270
I won't, for sure.
But I can if I want to.

590
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,989
Because those tricksters
are still at the hotel.

591
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,071
I can go and explain

592
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,152
that their little joke
may have tragic consequences.

593
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,278
They'll come here to apologise.

594
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,078
- But I'm not going.
- Why not?

595
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,470
Because now that I've found out

596
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,279
what has triggered
your total madness,

597
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,795
I don't think
you should be held back.

598
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,396
You'd forever blame me
for ruining your big chance.

599
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,199
And your state would only worsen.

600
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,713
Worsen... my state...

601
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,599
And maybe, faced with reality,

602
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,069
you'd realise your mistake.

603
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,708
Who knows, it might even cure you!

604
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,519
Who knows, it might bring me
fame and fortune!

605
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,752
But for now, you can't even buy
a slice of saucisson.

606
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,878
Sorry, I withdrew all my savings.

607
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,873
1300 francs and 25 centimes!

608
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,473
Where will that get you?

609
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,757
Paris!
All I need is a train ticket.

610
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,196
- And here it is.
- You should've bought a return.

611
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,557
No need.
I'll come back in my 8-cylinder.

612
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,188
My contract promises
a 10,000-franc advance.

613
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,351
And next Saturday, 1000 dollars.

614
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,511
Softening of the brain!

615
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,353
Legitimate and logical hope!

616
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,671
Pitiful and pretentious delusions!

617
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,116
Common sense and sensibility
of the average Frenchman!

618
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,953
Phantasmagoria of a fool!

619
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,554
Suspicions of a storekeeper!

620
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,393
Don't you see
you've been made a fool of?

621
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,312
A hand from the big-hearted!

622
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,313
Your contract would have
a forger in hysterics.

623
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,393
I am no forger
and that is why I'm not laughing!

624
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,915
Who could believe such claptrap!

625
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,868
With my savings, I'll buy you
Félix Potin supermarkets!

626
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,711
So sad!

627
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,350
However unjust, incredulous
and nasty you can be,

628
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,476
I'll buy you Félix Potin.

629
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,393
And if you don't want it,
I'll bin it.

630
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,436
I'll buy you the Olida Hams factory
for your birthday.

631
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,991
And the Meunier chocolate works
will be for Christmas.

632
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,993
You complained of the bread I ate,

633
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,152
but I'll fill you with cake!

634
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,072
Sad little man.

635
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,718
Sad, sad...

636
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,509
little man.

637
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,509
Quick, the movie woman
wants to see you.

638
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,557
- Where?
- At the hotel.

639
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,632
- Is she alone?
- Yes. And it's a secret.

640
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,475
- How do you know?
- She told me not to tell anyone.

641
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,393
- Is she insistent?
- She certainly is.

642
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,075
See, they can't even wait
for me to become a star!

643
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,278
Mind you, I guess
I'll be harder to get later.

644
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,399
- You think she...
- My child, you bring me the message

645
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,676
and you don't know what it means!

646
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,593
How sweet naivety can be!

647
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,673
She's not that pretty, but as
she's the first, I'll go for it.

648
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,913
<i>Later, it'll be a charming anecdote
in For You.</i>

649
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,198
<i>In For You.</i>

650
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,597
Hello, little Françoise.

651
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,390
- Hello, sir.
- My brother said you asked for me.

652
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,597
This hotel is unworthy
of you, me and my contract.

653
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,275
I couldn't keep you waiting.
I'm all yours.

654
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,154
Right. We're to leave later.

655
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,275
Exactly.

656
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,316
You too?

657
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,914
- You're leaving?
- I've bought my ticket.

658
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,392
- I'm sorry about that.
- Why, did you want to buy it?

659
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,429
Not at all. But now you have,
maybe I should reimburse you.

660
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,354
- Do I understand you right?
- It's not so hard to understand.

661
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,714
So you confess?

662
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,917
Let's say
I'm setting things straight.

663
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,389
Most elegantly and discreetly put.

664
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,553
I have great, sincere
and deep respect for you.

665
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,711
I'll decree that all my life.

666
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,395
If fate brings me success,
I owe my contract to you!

667
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,553
So you hold me singularly responsible
for this adventure?

668
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,473
You and you alone deserve the merit.

669
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,437
There's not much merit in it.

670
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,513
So you really didn't get it at all?

671
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,398
Would it please you that I did?

672
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,190
Sometimes we understand very well
but pretend not to.

673
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,359
- So your ticket was a joke?
- What do you mean, joke?

674
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,589
Here it is.

675
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,512
Then you don't understand.

676
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,955
I do.
I even understand a lady's modesty.

677
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,829
No need to explain further.
Seen and accepted!

678
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,594
You truly are an idiot.

679
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,637
- I'm not!
- You are!

680
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,234
I'm not!
You are a rascal.

681
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,234
You are so forward
you always get there first.

682
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,277
You naughty girl, you!

683
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,112
- What was that?
- A slap.

684
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,952
Would you believe it?

685
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,629
I'm sorry if I hit you hard.

686
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,755
Your contract was a joke, a trick.

687
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,798
One signed by
Messrs Bazouf and Vernickel?

688
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,191
A joke? After coming
from Hollywood to see me.

689
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,475
With 20 eye-witnesses!

690
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,596
Mr Vernickel doesn't exist!

691
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,909
But you saw them!

692
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,833
The photographer and props man.

693
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,515
That night, we were bored.

694
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,114
We'd been drinking.
You had too.

695
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,434
You were being pretentious,
so we wrote the contract as a joke.

696
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,149
But you took it seriously
and planned to leave for Paris.

697
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,675
So I had a duty
to tell you the truth.

698
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,308
- Because you're dutiful?
- Maybe I am.

699
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,074
How do you explain that my uncle,

700
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,879
who doesn't know you
or about your joke,

701
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,632
said exactly the same thing?

702
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,314
- Because he's sensible.
- And I'm not?

703
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,948
No, not really.

704
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,475
But you are poetic.

705
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,868
Thank you.

706
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,756
So if you don't work for my uncle,
who do you work for?

707
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,790
Which star or group of stars
has paid you

708
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,636
to get rid of young talents
who might threaten their fame?

709
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,838
Sir, have some common sense.
Or at least some modesty!

710
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,673
There could be a third explanation.

711
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,400
But it's so low
I won't even consider it.

712
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,310
What?

713
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,233
If I'm not wrong,
you're a film editor.

714
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,072
You fiddle with celluloid.

715
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,198
You cut it, stick it, patch it up,
and so on.

716
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,191
And so on, and so on.

717
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,830
What if you had sought refuge
in the backstage?

718
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,355
Because you were not wanted
on screen.

719
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,875
You dreamt of being Greta Garbo.

720
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,873
Without the looks,
you were sent to the wings.

721
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,634
This failure sits heavy
in your heart.

722
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,588
When you see a very talented man,
if I dare say so,

723
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,072
sign a fabulous contract
you could never have signed yourself,

724
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,708
you are filled with rage and envy

725
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,190
and you do your utmost
to thwart his destiny.

726
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,670
But no, perfidious one,
it's not so easy!

727
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,400
I shall be on that train!

728
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,756
Pity for you.

729
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,789
I bid you farewell, madam.

730
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,279
Good idea,
trying to trick a madman!

731
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,029
Shut up and get out!

732
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,718
Go on, out!

733
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,838
Beat it, Whiskers!
Enough is enough.

734
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,991
- The president, please.
- You are?

735
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,752
- I've a contract.
- Show it.

736
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,911
I don't think I'm required

737
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,311
to show my contract to a doorman,
however big he is.

738
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,550
Then write your name down there.

739
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,759
No point. Just tell the president
that the schpountz has arrived.

740
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,388
- The what?
- The schpountz!

741
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,754
You're the schpountz?

742
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,433
Indeed I am.

743
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,273
That's excellent. I'll tell him.

744
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,069
In the meantime, be so kind as
to wait on the pavement.

745
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,395
In the street?

746
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,596
Naturally. That's the rule.

747
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,796
Which doesn't apply to the schpountz.

748
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,635
To the schpountz like anyone.
Even more so to the schpountz.

749
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,997
- So please, sir...
- Watch the suit!

750
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,792
What, what, what!

751
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,231
With a tierce.

752
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,194
- The high card?
- The king.

753
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,270
I'm good.

754
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,159
I have 50 points in diamonds

755
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,636
who'll own no one nothing.

756
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,153
These two are so jammy!

757
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,471
I'll attack on the right flank:
Diamonds!

758
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,357
Nothing's ready.

759
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,511
<i>Studio A is still Napoleon.</i>

760
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,717
And studio B
is full of girls in tutus.

761
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,952
<i>A film called Sex Appeal,
and it's long from over!</i>

762
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,997
We only started yesterday.

763
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,720
<i>Napoleon should have
left us studio A.</i>

764
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,030
We have only one scene left.

765
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,590
But with 200 extras,
it's hard going.

766
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,109
We're already on the 35th take.

767
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,670
The Russian director
is having a nervous breakdown.

768
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,993
The poor chap's gone crazy.
He bit the props man!

769
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,668
- Seen the boss?
- Yes, but I didn't talk to him.

770
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,432
He was with a sheriff.

771
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,275
Then he brought in some bird
complaining about a poster.

772
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,157
Bird?

773
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,918
The loony one!

774
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,799
The furnisher's mistress
who fancied the dresser.

775
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,669
Oh, the one who kept shooting
the cabinet doors!

776
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,559
Rita Camelia?
She's a good girl!

777
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,679
Listen, Meyerboom,
who delivered the cash for this film?

778
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,629
The great Galapiat,
the king of furnishings.

779
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,631
He gave us 1 million.

780
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,950
And who brought Galapiat?

781
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,269
His motorcar.

782
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,397
Stop being silly!

783
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,713
- Have you kissed him?
- Fortunately not!

784
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,110
Unfortunately, I have!

785
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,751
I got him to fork out one million,
and I had to pay for it.

786
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,431
And the author?
Were you the one

787
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,033
to woo the author?

788
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,033
- The author too!
- That's right.

789
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,351
Wotsisname, with one ear
bigger than the other.

790
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,274
And the advertising head,
the director, assistant director,

791
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,317
studio manager, sound man...

792
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,029
Who else must I sleep with
to see my name on a poster?

793
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,191
You could try the printer!

794
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,114
- His address?
- On his posters. But it's too late.

795
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,477
Where are you going, handsome?

796
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,471
To the president's office.

797
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,234
- The president?
- The president of what?

798
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,073
The president
of the president's office.

799
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,830
Can't you redo the posters?

800
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,479
Too expensive, my dear.

801
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,835
But you must redo them, my dear.

802
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,639
They've been sent
all over France, my dear.

803
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,916
Then call them back, my dear.

804
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,832
And burn the lot.

805
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,468
- You're charming.
- And you're stupid.

806
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,632
If you don't call them back
in the next 5 minutes,

807
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,190
I'll cause a calamity or a scandal.
- What's the difference?

808
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,396
If I were to shoot you,

809
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,313
it would be a calamity for you.

810
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,432
If I tried to kill myself

811
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,398
or ripped off my clothes
and cried rape,

812
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,472
that would be a scandal.
See the difference now?

813
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,473
- Come, don't be childish...
- 5 minutes!

814
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,352
- Well?
- Well what?

815
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,192
Your 5 minutes are up!

816
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,833
- But...
- You don't get it!

817
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,072
Oh, my dearest friend!

818
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,391
Thank you very much
for coming so promptly.

819
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,588
Just give me one minute to conclude
my important business with the lady.

820
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,513
She's one of our biggest stars.

821
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,397
One minute.
Just give me one minute.

822
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,994
And don't stray from the door.

823
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,990
- Right, you...
- Don't take that tone!

824
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,709
- I'm not your mistress.
- You're mistress to all but me!

825
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,275
You want to start shooting?

826
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,829
Not before I've slapped your face.

827
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,479
Get it?

828
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,075
- But...
- Quiet. Not a sound.

829
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,549
I can't do anything this time.
But never mind.

830
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,077
But that young man outside
is bringing me millions.

831
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,953
- Him?
- Yes, him.

832
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,875
I can't tell you his name,
I promised to keep it secret.

833
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,554
But I can tell you that his father

834
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,030
owns coal mines and foundries
in the north of France,

835
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,715
four department stores in New York
and two in London.

836
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,111
He's a multi-millionaire.
In dollars!

837
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,713
What's he financing?

838
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,553
5 or 6 films with you starring.

839
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,597
- Right!
- My word of honour.

840
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,432
But if you make a scene,

841
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,512
he'll lose confidence
and won't give the cash.

842
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,878
But if you behave like a lady,
with all your natural chic,

843
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,474
anything could happen for you.

844
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,631
So leave me alone with him.
You'll see.

845
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,313
"With... ", you promise?

846
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,393
Why have "with"
when you can have "starring"!

847
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,917
Come in, my dear chap.

848
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,034
Give me one minute...
Take a seat.

849
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,430
One minute to see the lady out.

850
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,158
Naturally.

851
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,074
Sir, I don't know your name,

852
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,435
but I'd like to say that if one day

853
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,115
I have the honour of appearing
in one of your films,

854
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,952
I'd give you my best.

855
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,792
And that's saying something!

856
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,270
Madam, the honour would be all mine!

857
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,277
This way, dear lady.

858
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,628
At last.

859
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,719
Here we are.

860
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,757
But that doorman!

861
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,798
I guess he's right,
because if he let everyone in,

862
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,872
we wouldn't be able to work in peace.

863
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,714
Saved!

864
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,875
So tell me, old chap...
Who are you?

865
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,077
I am... the schpountz.

866
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,710
- You're...
- The schpountz.

867
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,632
Yes, yes, of course.

868
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,317
Know what I mean?

869
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,598
You most certainly are what you say.
No two ways about it.

870
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,637
But on this occasion,

871
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,951
what can I do that would please you?

872
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,872
Finalise my contract.

873
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,918
You have a contract?

874
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,913
- Here it is.
- Excuse me... Thank you.

875
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,159
What do you think?

876
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,632
Very interesting.
1000 dollars a week isn't bad.

877
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,109
- To start with.
- Yes, naturally.

878
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,396
Because after...

879
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,718
Yes, but for now,
what would make you happy?

880
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,440
To know what time shooting starts.

881
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,116
But I must inform you
that I refuse to film this morning.

882
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,111
I flatly refuse that.

883
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,872
I quite agree.

884
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,953
I need time to study my lines,
to choose my costume and make-up.

885
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,714
- I hope you understand.
- Perfectly.

886
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,077
- I'd like to start at about 4: 23 pm.
- It's noted.

887
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,312
I'll need my lines
a full 10 minutes beforehand.

888
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,799
It's noted.

889
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,349
And as I left without
a large sum of money,

890
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,717
I require an immediate advance
of 10,000 francs.

891
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,235
As paragraph 43
of my contract states.

892
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,234
Your wish is my command.
I'll fetch the money in banknotes.

893
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,789
Please don't think me
a man of money.

894
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,428
But we need to make
my contract binding.

895
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,354
You as a businessman,
and me as an artiste!

896
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,717
Very well, sir.
Just give me one minute.

897
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,797
That minute, sir...

898
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,429
I grant you.

899
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,828
Thank you.

900
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,592
He seems a little crazy.

901
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,836
A very good start.

902
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,709
Adolphe!

903
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,711
There's a nut in my office!

904
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,315
Have two stagehands remove him!

905
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,279
What's your use
if you let nuts onto the lot?

906
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,476
There are so many nuts in here,

907
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,438
I don't know who to let in
and who not!

908
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,555
What's he like?

909
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,838
Tall guy with a long face
and a contract for the schpountz!

910
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,594
I threw him out.
He must've sneaked back in.

911
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,194
Hello! Is that you, Edouard?

912
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,511
Can you remove a loony
from the boss's office?

913
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,476
But nicely!

914
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,599
Do it nicely.
Two or three thick ears, but no more.

915
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,633
Hello, sir.

916
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,750
Gentlemen.

917
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,434
We came to say
the boss can't meet you.

918
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,795
What?
But he's already met me.

919
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,996
Then the meeting's over.

920
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,118
Over? I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

921
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,636
And I also think, good sirs,
that you are mistaken!

922
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,631
We're just doing our job.

923
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,236
Will you walk out normally,
or would you like some help?

924
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,358
Gents, you're dicing
with your living here.

925
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,636
Watch it or you'll lose your jobs.

926
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,758
For I am not budging
from this armchair.

927
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,514
Then the armchair will have to move.

928
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,159
Come on, Edouard.

929
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,432
I'd love to see the president's face
when he sees I'm not in his office!

930
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,671
I saw him, I tell you!

931
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,997
Impossible, we're telling you!

932
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,352
Ask Adolphe then.

933
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,396
What's up?

934
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,712
You went a bit far this time,
giving that fruitcake a contract.

935
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,072
- You saw him?
- Sure. And not for the last time.

936
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,870
He's nuts. He came all the way
from Marseilles to camp at my door.

937
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,952
And he'll end up firing shots at me.

938
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,271
That one? I don't think so.

939
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,398
You're numbskulls
for letting him on that train.

940
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,949
There are enough loonies around Paris

941
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,193
without bringing more from the south.
And this one's far from done!

942
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,032
The schpountz!

943
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,156
You spell the end of this!

944
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,833
What's up, old chap?

945
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,878
You're not aware
of the misunderstanding?

946
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,916
Not at all.

947
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,311
First, the doorman stopped me
entering the studios.

948
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,199
- That already seemed odd.
- And it was!

949
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,273
I awaited my chance
and slipped in surreptitiously

950
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,759
with a truck.

951
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,072
- A fine debut in resourcefulness.
- Well I wasn't born yesterday!

952
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,357
I found the president's office
and entered.

953
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,839
He let you in?

954
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,673
With open arms.
He was expecting me.

955
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,875
He said that?

956
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,474
He did, he did.

957
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,235
I told him about my chat
with the bosses and my plans...

958
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,153
Only natural.
And how did he react?

959
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,039
He was enchanted.
Totally enchanted.

960
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,158
He went to get me
an advance of 10,000 francs.

961
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,914
- I didn't ask for too much?
- Not at all.

962
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,913
A few minutes later,
in came three gorillas

963
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,389
who literally threw me out.

964
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,038
They carried me in an armchair
into the street. How about that?

965
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,636
Such swift action seems
to result from a misunderstanding.

966
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,678
A misunderstanding or a cabal?

967
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,957
There is possibly a cabal at work.

968
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,557
It must be a cabal.
And I know who started it.

969
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,199
Really? Who?

970
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,555
That woman with the pointy nose.

971
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,029
The sensual one
who writes things down

972
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,792
and is trying to thwart me.

973
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,393
Françoise? Why her?

974
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,951
She treated me so abominably
that I'll tell you everything.

975
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,596
I rejected her advances.

976
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,670
- When?
- Two days ago.

977
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,315
She asked to meet in secret.

978
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,833
- What?
- Yes. In secret.

979
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,594
She told my brother
not to tell anyone.

980
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,194
I went and I was rather clumsy.

981
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,638
So in anger, she told me
my contract was just a trick

982
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,473
and that it was best I stay at home.

983
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,074
- And if I were to tell you...
- What?

984
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,072
That the contract wasn't serious

985
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,994
and that you could take
the 20:46 train home.

986
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,148
I'd say it was she
who put you up to it

987
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,198
and that you were another Judas.

988
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,678
Everyone's against me.

989
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,879
They want to bar my way,
but I'll bust through the barriers.

990
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,510
Woe to the hypocrites,
false friends and bandits!

991
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,797
I'll smash them like glass.
How could they? To me?

992
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,713
Calm down, old boy,
I was only joking.

993
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,713
I know I was stupid,
but it was just a joke.

994
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,792
Very bad taste, sir.
Very bad indeed.

995
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,550
- With me or against me?
- With you, of course.

996
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,640
Fine... Sit down.

997
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,436
If you help me today...

998
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,392
I will help you later.

999
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,232
Thank you, you're too kind.

1000
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,277
No, don't thank me.

1001
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,271
Listen...

1002
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,271
No one can get in my way

1003
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,954
if I can keep in touch
with the president.

1004
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,554
Presently, I am out of touch.

1005
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,836
Do you have the necessary clout
and authority

1006
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,152
over that giant doorman
to get me onto the lot?

1007
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,154
Maybe the giant doorman
is a member of the cabal.

1008
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,511
That explains everything.

1009
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,236
So, what do we do?

1010
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,791
Look... Take these shooting scripts.

1011
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,753
Go round to the back door
of the studios...

1012
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,512
Is there a doorman?

1013
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,908
There is.

1014
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,315
Giant?

1015
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,799
No, tiny.

1016
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,478
You walk past boldly and say, "Lab!"

1017
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,959
"Lab"?

1018
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,749
If he asks why, you say, "Astruc!"

1019
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,875
"Astruc"?

1020
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,032
- Yes. I'm Astruc.
- Oh, you're Astruc!

1021
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,398
Very well... "Lab, Astruc... "

1022
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,232
"Astruc, lab... "

1023
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,757
Excellent, excellent!

1024
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,310
Well, Astruc... goodbye.

1025
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,398
Is it true you met him in secret?

1026
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,950
It wasn't in secret.
We met on the hotel terrace.

1027
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,917
But you didn't tell anyone.

1028
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,469
I don't have to account for all I do.

1029
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,551
No, but a secret's a secret!

1030
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,870
And the schpountz is convinced

1031
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,600
you're thwarting him
as he wouldn't sleep with you.

1032
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,513
- You offered to?
- He believes so.

1033
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,195
He said he'd smash anyone
barring his way like glass.

1034
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,155
He was so stupid and pretentious,

1035
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,551
I told him how to get here
so we can teach him a lesson.

1036
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,039
- Lab!
- Who for?

1037
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,838
- Astruc!
- In the canteen.

1038
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,194
Thanks.

1039
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,915
Has anyone seen Napoleon?

1040
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,399
What is it?

1041
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,596
There you are, Mr Napoleon!

1042
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,557
You're on. Come, Mr Napoleon.

1043
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,596
Finally ready?

1044
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,228
<i>- Si, signor, I'm ready!
- Ready ready?</i>

1045
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,552
Perfectly. The extras are rehearsed
just as they should be.

1046
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,518
You know, this is the 37th take.

1047
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,114
Money's flying
and the film's still not done.

1048
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,432
My contract ends tonight.
Tomorrow it's 20,000 francs per day.

1049
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,750
But I will finish tonight!

1050
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,152
If not, I'll shoot myself with a gun
like a machine-gun

1051
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,517
and cut my throat
with the make-up artist's razor!

1052
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,114
So calm down, Napoleon,
and come with me.

1053
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,759
- I am calm.
- Then come.

1054
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,196
You too, please, Mr Pope.
And you.

1055
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,670
It will be magnificent,
splendid, superb!

1056
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,831
Watch your step, Napoleon.

1057
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,672
<i>Scusate mi.</i>

1058
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,717
<i>Avanti, avanti!</i>

1059
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,439
Who's that chap?

1060
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,558
Bodigar Glazounow.
German, Turkish, or something.

1061
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,314
He took a Russian name
but speaks Italian.

1062
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,472
Which helped him become
a big French director.

1063
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,629
Any talent?

1064
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,791
What would he do if he had?

1065
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,316
Anyway, he wanted to do an epic
and isn't managing.

1066
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,789
What if we sent him the schpountz?

1067
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,873
We make him up,
dress him as a general,

1068
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,632
and just throw him on set.

1069
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,076
- It'd be explosive.
- With fireworks up his arse!

1070
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,038
- And Glazounow screaming!
- Interesting!

1071
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,158
In his anger, he might reveal
his mother tongue!

1072
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,072
Don't count me in on it.

1073
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,593
Gentlemen!

1074
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,394
- Did our friend explain?
- He did indeed.

1075
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,028
Did he tell you of my difficulties

1076
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,875
caused by a secret, subtle influence?

1077
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,270
- A cabal!
- Of course he did.

1078
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,637
And on my arrival,
the aforesaid cabal

1079
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,393
made a hasty exit.

1080
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,837
Thanks to him,
I'm in my rightful place.

1081
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,673
We're delighted. It was high time.

1082
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,388
I do admit that this cabal...

1083
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,434
caused me to suffer deep humiliation.

1084
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,753
I had to come in the back door
under a false pretext.

1085
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,559
- Everything starts small.
- It's romantic.

1086
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,837
In a way, yes.
But let me tell you something.

1087
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,310
In the hope that everyone
will benefit from it.

1088
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,508
I came in the back door,
but I shall leave by the front!

1089
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,557
- I'll shake on that.
- Thanks.

1090
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,917
- Maybe sooner than you think.
- Thanks again.

1091
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,834
There'll be weeping
and gnashing of teeth!

1092
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,276
- Most probably.
- Maybe kicks in the butt too!

1093
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,392
No. I'd never kick...

1094
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,993
a cabal.

1095
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,476
Let's get down to business.

1096
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,670
I just saw Mr Meyerboom.
He was very interested in your visit.

1097
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,592
So he said.
You have my 10,000?

1098
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,115
Oh, yes!
Where's that 10,000 gone?

1099
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,748
Mr Meyerboom
gave his secretary a cheque.

1100
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,273
She'll bring it to you.

1101
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,637
Now, you'll have to have
a screen test.

1102
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,032
Must I accept?

1103
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,839
- Absolutely.
- In your own interests.

1104
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,319
Very well.

1105
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,950
What does this screen test
consist of?

1106
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,070
Remember, this is only a test.

1107
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,118
It's so we can classify you.

1108
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,635
For your voice, your posture,

1109
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,916
and especially your presence.

1110
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,073
It will be a vital lesson for you.

1111
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,279
Certainly. But I am a little worried
about the make-up.

1112
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,990
I'm wondering if this make-up

1113
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,435
doesn't mask
my range of expressions.

1114
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,034
Not at all. On the contrary.

1115
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,114
Frankly, make-up man...

1116
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,550
I barely recognise myself.

1117
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,156
But that look in your eyes!
What are you saying?

1118
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,392
- It's all in the eyes.
- You're right.

1119
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,517
It's all in the eyes.

1120
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,718
Promise my name
won't be on the poster?

1121
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,438
There's no danger of that.

1122
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,433
Because I don't know
if I'll be any good

1123
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,716
or how well it will go.

1124
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,270
We know you'll make
a sensational entrance!

1125
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,716
And an even more astonishing exit!

1126
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,673
Thank you.

1127
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,349
Let's do it.
Goodbye, make-up man.

1128
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,033
After you, General.

1129
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,117
Signal the cameraman.

1130
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,599
Is he weeping?

1131
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,793
- Almost there. You have your lines?
- Sure I have.

1132
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,598
Once again, whispering.

1133
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,193
Whispering?

1134
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,275
I'll play Napoleon. OK, start.

1135
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,559
"Sire...

1136
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,475
"In the name of the Grande Armée,

1137
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,837
"in memory of Waterloo
and heralding St Helena,

1138
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,878
"I come to say farewell or rather... "

1139
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,513
Oh, my hat!

1140
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,433
- "Farewell" is where I kneel?
- Exactly.

1141
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,313
- All right?
- Yes.

1142
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,950
- I run in like I just dismounted?
- Right.

1143
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,998
- And I interrupt Napoleon?
- With authority.

1144
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,151
Count on me, I'll cut him off.

1145
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,031
When it comes to interruptions...

1146
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,915
<i>"Napoleon", scene 1094, take 38.</i>

1147
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,389
Take 38?
Because I wasn't here.

1148
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,872
<i>Farewell, my children!</i>

1149
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,075
Fine voice!

1150
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,437
<i>My wishes go with you always.</i>

1151
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,599
<i>Keep me in your memory.</i>

1152
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,232
- Well...
- Go!

1153
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,072
- I'm on?
- Go for it.

1154
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,031
<i>In the name of the Grande Armée,</i>

1155
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,919
<i>in memory of Waterloo
and heralding St Helena,</i>

1156
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,196
<i>I come to say farewell,
or rather adieu!</i>

1157
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,112
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

1158
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,638
But that wasn't even in the script!

1159
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,434
After him!

1160
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,354
To me!
They did such a thing to me!

1161
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,911
He's hidden in Props.

1162
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:19,835
Leave the poor chap. He just
earned us an extra day's pay.

1163
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,514
You're right.
Let's pretend we can't find him.

1164
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,673
Come quickly.

1165
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,073
Say, old boy!

1166
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,071
They didn't hit you, did they?

1167
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,716
Don't be so upset. It's no tragedy.

1168
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,549
- It was just a joke.
- We didn't mean to hurt you.

1169
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,757
- You went too far.
- It was just a friendly lesson.

1170
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,639
- He should accept it.
- Say, Irénée...

1171
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,034
Has he gone mad?

1172
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,510
Admit that I had you fooled.

1173
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,750
True. I thought he was crying.

1174
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,354
Cry? Me? Why?

1175
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,832
Because I tricked you?

1176
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,355
So you tricked us, did you?

1177
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,748
What trick?

1178
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,912
You don't get it?
Then you don't get anything.

1179
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,832
Get what?

1180
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,038
That in this whole story,
you're the schpountzes!

1181
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,112
I wasn't fooled for a second.

1182
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,477
The whole thing was a bit silly.

1183
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,189
Did you really think
I wanted to be in the movies?

1184
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,795
Well, it was because you said so.

1185
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,913
You know why I said that?

1186
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,676
Because when I saw you were
a bunch of heartless idiots...

1187
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,113
I had fun with you.

1188
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,191
That wasn't very charitable.

1189
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,715
Why should I be charitable?

1190
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,795
Do you know any charitable people?

1191
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,398
Show me one here.

1192
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,949
If one day you meet a schpountz
or an imbecile,

1193
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,398
wouldn't you try to poke fun at him?

1194
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,314
Only... for it to succeed,

1195
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,631
it has to be done with more skill

1196
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,832
and much more spirit.

1197
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,349
Luckily you happened on me.

1198
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,519
And it was I...

1199
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,589
who fooled you.

1200
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,991
You did it very well.
And we're not taking it badly.

1201
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,833
- We're not at all angry.
- On the contrary.

1202
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,436
- I find you very spiritual.
- Sure. And elegant too.

1203
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,590
What you tried to do
wasn't very elegant.

1204
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,277
Especially you, the phoney American.

1205
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,113
If I was some poor, penniless guy...

1206
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,509
What then?

1207
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,797
- We'd buy you lunch.
- And your ticket home.

1208
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,031
Thanks, but don't bother.

1209
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,078
To see this through,
it's what we should do.

1210
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,231
You'd pretend not to know,

1211
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,988
and we'd be a train ticket
out of pocket.

1212
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,513
It's only fair.

1213
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,477
Do it for us as a favour.

1214
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,108
When our pals find out
you tricked us,

1215
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,679
we'll be laughing stocks.

1216
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,148
Too bad for you.

1217
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,153
Poor chap.
I like your strength of character.

1218
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,276
You call me a poor chap?

1219
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,914
Poor photographer!

1220
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,439
Listen to me, the lot of you.

1221
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,674
I'm rich.
I've been in business 10 years.

1222
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,717
My father left me a large sum.

1223
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,589
I have offices everywhere:
Marseilles, Lyons, Paris.

1224
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,998
When I met you, I had gone to visit
my uncle's grocery.

1225
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,796
He wrote and told me business
was bad so I went to help out.

1226
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,112
Because I...

1227
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:56,194
have a good heart
and I don't mock idiots.

1228
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,675
Then since I had business in Paris...

1229
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,675
I came here just to see how far
you could push your cruelty.

1230
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,513
I saw...

1231
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,238
and now I know.

1232
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,394
As for train tickets,
I could buy them for all of you!

1233
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,915
And for every schpountz
in the galaxy!

1234
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,958
The railway would make a packet!

1235
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,908
Gents, the boss wants to see you
right now in his office.

1236
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,356
- Mr Meyerboom?
- There's a real hoo-ha going on.

1237
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,229
That Russian director
is screaming his head off.

1238
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,358
They brought some idiot
from Marseilles.

1239
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,638
I don't like idiots coming onto a set
where I am working.

1240
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,075
I understand entirely.

1241
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,994
I will impose sanctions,
rest assured.

1242
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,350
Dear friend, it's impossible.
I've lost all inspiration.

1243
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,399
My nerves are shot.
I can't take any more.

1244
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,632
How about a whisky in the canteen?

1245
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,075
You could carry on filming later.

1246
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,549
One, two, three whiskies...

1247
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,278
I'll try.

1248
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,916
- I'll try.
- Take it easy.

1249
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,036
Maybe four whiskies.

1250
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:15,916
Let's go.

1251
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,113
Look after Irénée.
See you after the fight.

1252
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,113
- He'll give us a grilling.
- For this?

1253
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,670
Worse still,
his office has dreadful acoustics.

1254
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,594
- Do we tell him the truth?
- Of course. Who do you think we are?

1255
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,479
We've enough vices,
without being liars too.

1256
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,198
Let's go, then.

1257
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,759
So, do you get it now?

1258
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,191
Since the very first day.

1259
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,478
Miss, please excuse me.
I must meet with my board.

1260
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,950
Irénée, stop being silly.
There's no point.

1261
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,838
How much money do you have?

1262
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,560
Me? One franc fifty.

1263
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,313
What are you going to do?

1264
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,552
Anything. Or rather, nothing.

1265
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,593
I can't think straight.
I don't know where I am.

1266
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,594
You're at the studios.
Tonight you'll have a ticket home.

1267
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,752
A ticket?
All you talk about is my train ticket!

1268
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,997
Like it was a cure-all.

1269
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,316
It won't cure me of being stupid.

1270
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,030
But if only a train would!

1271
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,633
I did warn you.

1272
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,472
That's the worst thing.

1273
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,673
I should've understood.

1274
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,513
But I didn't understand.

1275
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,355
Because you're pure and you're...

1276
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,590
- Stupid!
- No, not at all.

1277
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,479
It's just that your confidence
blinds you.

1278
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,718
Confidence in who?
In me?

1279
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,071
You know, I admired myself.

1280
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,072
When there was no reason to.

1281
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,994
And not only that.
I treated others with contempt.

1282
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,556
That was the logical outcome
of my self-admiration.

1283
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,118
From my pedestal,
others seemed so small.

1284
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,751
Small, petty and stupid.

1285
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,516
Dreadful!

1286
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,752
For such a deception,
don't imagine that...

1287
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,195
No. I don't imagine anything.

1288
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,669
I don't even find
this episode tragic.

1289
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,395
No one sheds a tear
for the misfortunes of an idiot.

1290
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,914
Not even the idiot.

1291
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,834
What I truly regret
are my past actions.

1292
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,752
Take my uncle.

1293
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,310
I despised him with all my heart.

1294
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,517
Affectionately, sure.
But I still despised him.

1295
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,195
- You were wrong to.
- Too right.

1296
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,315
He worked hard to feed me
and gave me spending money.

1297
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,273
And I spoke to him insolently

1298
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,598
with my lofty pretentiousness
and stupidity.

1299
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,269
I was ashamed of the grocery.

1300
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,111
The grocery should've been
ashamed of me.

1301
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,430
Come on, it's not such a drama.

1302
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,272
But it is.

1303
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,876
I thought I was someone,
when in fact I'm a nobody.

1304
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,798
There's a big difference.

1305
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,919
There are other careers
than being a movie star.

1306
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,638
Not for me.

1307
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,553
<i>I have a degree
in For You and Movie World.</i>

1308
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,235
That won't make me
a newsstand architect.

1309
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,312
Lots of people aren't
newsstand architects.

1310
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,756
I can't do anything.

1311
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,997
I can't even bang in a nail.

1312
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,957
I tried once.

1313
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,033
But I broke a finger.

1314
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,192
I'm a qualified good-for-nothing.

1315
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,075
The sad and pretentious
Sir Good-for-nothing!

1316
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,231
My uncle always said,

1317
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,518
"You're not good-for-nothing,
but terrible-at-everything. "

1318
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,592
And when he was really angry,
he'd say,

1319
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,513
"Go and drown yourself,
you useless clod!"

1320
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,072
I should've done it.

1321
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,238
You conducted yourselves
like ragamuffins.

1322
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,798
People who owe their livings

1323
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,355
and joys to the movies

1324
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,990
should have the greatest respect
for the filming of an epic.

1325
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,070
<i>By delaying the end of Napoleon,</i>

1326
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,118
<i>you have also delayed
Manon Lescaut.</i>

1327
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,234
Your charming prank
will cost me at least 25,000 francs!

1328
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,196
What say you?

1329
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,388
Nothing!

1330
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,749
But I do.

1331
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,075
When you work for Meyerboom,

1332
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,834
your boss,
but moreover your friend,

1333
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,709
and your prank
costs him 25,000 francs,

1334
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,155
you at least invite him to join in,

1335
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,914
so that he can have a laugh too.

1336
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,069
- If we'd known.
- I could kiss him.

1337
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,153
You're not very nice at all.

1338
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,675
I'm in this office all day long,

1339
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,558
tearing my hair out,

1340
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,874
calculating, looking for a way
to finance the next film.

1341
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,753
My lawyer smiles at me
like an undertaker,

1342
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,717
while you make your own film.

1343
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,235
You play hilarious pranks,
but never invite me in.

1344
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,959
- Why?
- We daren't.

1345
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,193
Because... well... because...

1346
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,829
Because I'm old.

1347
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,915
Do you know when you're old?

1348
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,789
When youngsters stop involving you.
You call everyone "tu".

1349
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,510
But no calls you "tu" any more.

1350
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,511
You all call each other "tu".

1351
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,229
Director, actors, stagehands...

1352
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,197
You all work together,

1353
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,272
eat together, play tricks together...

1354
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,080
You're like a bouquet of flowers,

1355
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,357
full of intelligence,
friendship and laughter.

1356
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,875
I tried to become one of you.

1357
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,234
Impossible!

1358
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,278
If only you'd involved me once,

1359
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,715
if you'd let me in on a joke,

1360
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,670
I'd have felt I had slipped under
the string that fastens the bouquet.

1361
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,592
That would've been something.

1362
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,079
But no, never!

1363
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,030
He's a Jew and he's the boss!

1364
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,229
Mr Meyerboom...

1365
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,914
See: "Mr Meyerboom"!

1366
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,231
When I'm not there,
it's "That old fart Meyerboom".

1367
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,516
Or "That idiot Meyerboom".

1368
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,118
Not one of you ever has
the kindness to say,

1369
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,555
"How you doing, old mate?"

1370
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,792
I'll never know
friendship like that again.

1371
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,032
And that's what old age is!

1372
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,438
You're dismissed.

1373
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,717
- But Mr Meyerboom...
- It's all right, sir.

1374
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,270
Off you go, gentlemen, off you go!

1375
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,398
Go play pranks without me!

1376
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,156
And if that phoney Russian,
Italian or Turk screams at you,

1377
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,198
if that director
says anything at all,

1378
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,794
give his butt a kick from me!

1379
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,836
You're here?
What I just told them was stupid.

1380
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,878
Oh no, it wasn't stupid at all.

1381
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,600
You weren't involved
in that daft prank,

1382
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,830
but how about a good deed?

1383
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,275
It's not as youthful,
but if you like.

1384
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,193
It's that poor boy
we brought from Marseilles.

1385
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,834
The schpountz. He's penniless.

1386
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,958
He can't go home
because he left in a huff.

1387
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,829
He'd rather drown himself
than go home after two days.

1388
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,436
He'd be wrong to.
So what does he want?

1389
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,190
He wanted to act.
But he'd be happy with any job.

1390
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,828
This morning
he came across as a loony.

1391
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,753
Maybe he could work in Props.

1392
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,275
OK, I'll go back and get the rest.

1393
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,752
A Provençal clock
with chimes that work.

1394
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,670
We have one.

1395
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,796
A big, varnished cup-and-ball.

1396
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,713
I can knock one up
about 2 metres high.

1397
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,440
No, one as big as a melon will do.

1398
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,916
That's it.
Ready for noon tomorrow?

1399
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,354
I'll see.

1400
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,953
I'll be upset if it's not.

1401
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,156
- There's a lot.
- All right.

1402
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,198
The music-box is vital.
The director insists on it.

1403
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,396
A music-box circa 1880.

1404
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,472
Approx 50 x 30, ebony,
handle on the right

1405
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,393
<i>and it plays J'ai du bon tabac
and La Cantinère du Régiment.</i>

1406
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,630
- In what key?
- What do you mean?

1407
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,588
In A-flat, C-sharp or D?

1408
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,671
I like to know what I'm asked for.

1409
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,400
Circa and approx
always end in fights.

1410
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,917
Say what you want and I'll find it.
But don't be vague.

1411
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,638
It complicates matters.

1412
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,870
OK.

1413
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,112
Irénée's not only comical
in his looks,

1414
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:58,432
but in how he talks, how he walks,
how he sits,

1415
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,910
in the faces he pulls...

1416
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,514
He's a natural.
He doesn't know he's a comic.

1417
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,514
- He may be a genius.
- And you may be sweet on him.

1418
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,953
Mr Meyerboom! With his big teeth!

1419
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,753
Grandma, why are your teeth so big?

1420
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,549
- All the better to eat you with!
- I'm not Red Riding Hood!

1421
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,756
Always be wary of comics.

1422
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,310
They make more women swoon
than the looks of lead actors.

1423
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,550
So this genius is in Props.

1424
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,759
My studio would be no good
if it left geniuses in Props.

1425
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,239
So we'll find him a part.

1426
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,199
What do you say?

1427
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,272
- No. And no again.
- Why not?

1428
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,036
I've been happy for a year.
It's a small job, but I like it.

1429
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,034
It's the only possible job for me,
because it's a madman's job.

1430
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,474
So I say no.

1431
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,518
Listen.
Here's what I need for tomorrow.

1432
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,675
Three monkeys.
Peculiar music-box.

1433
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,354
Sealskin kayak.
E- flat hunting horn.

1434
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,080
Orange-blossom crown.
Worm in a jar.

1435
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,471
Veterinary syringe.
2 kg of black olives. Dumb parrot.

1436
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,518
I'm thinking of it now.
I'll dream of it.

1437
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,070
By noon tomorrow, I'll have
found, rented or bought it all.

1438
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,028
And if someone won't sell it to me,
I'll steal it.

1439
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,633
It's fascinating.

1440
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,991
In that case, I won't insist.

1441
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,550
You're entitled to insist,
but it'll change nothing.

1442
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,633
I no longer see the actors in movies.

1443
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,236
All I look at are the props.

1444
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,678
If the props are well chosen
and fit the set, the film is good.

1445
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,513
Props people aren't admired enough.

1446
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,270
People don't realise
that a badly chosen teapot

1447
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,829
can totally ruin a love scene.

1448
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,192
I'd blame a bad actor
rather than a teapot.

1449
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,079
Maybe. All the more reason
for me not to act.

1450
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,549
I don't mind supplying my teapot.

1451
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,836
But not the mug as well.

1452
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,988
And what if I were awful?

1453
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,832
The reason I am among you is to say

1454
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,389
I will not be at tonight's projection.

1455
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,595
Why not?

1456
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,355
I have no desire to see
a film I star in booed.

1457
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,673
Mr Galubert, it has never happened
and never will.

1458
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,193
I, Galubert,

1459
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,794
France's one and only true actor,

1460
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,474
is engaged at high cost for the lead

1461
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,633
<i>in a charming film
called Son of the Bedouin.</i>

1462
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,597
The film you shall see tonight.

1463
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,834
One of the bit parts around my own,
which serve to highlight me,

1464
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,832
featured a second comic.

1465
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,709
A role so unimportant
that Meyerboom gave it

1466
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,350
to a debutant who was, I believe,
thirty-fifth props man.

1467
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,354
I, Galubert, accepted to play
alongside this props man.

1468
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,438
You were most kind.

1469
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,832
But he has none of your class.
Alongside you, he'll vanish.

1470
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,276
All we see is him. That I know.

1471
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,159
When Galubert plays,
one should be thankful.

1472
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,550
When an expensive Galubert is used

1473
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,995
to launch a star who's paid peanuts,

1474
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,957
Galubert doesn't stand for it.

1475
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,190
Master...

1476
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,238
stay with us to witness your triumph.

1477
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,790
I will not attend this projection.

1478
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,874
I will be presented by a bailiff.

1479
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,593
For there are crimes against art
akin to sacrilege.

1480
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,158
Ladies, gentlemen, I take my leave.

1481
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,149
Exit backstage!

1482
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,958
The old ham!

1483
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,112
What he says isn't true.

1484
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,669
Oh, but it's perfectly true.

1485
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,071
This former glory
was enticed into a trap.

1486
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,433
And the old ham had his throat slit.

1487
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,233
You exaggerate!

1488
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,630
No, I don't.
I'm not from Marseilles.

1489
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,552
The future is quite clear.

1490
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,599
Irénée's part is perfect
and will bring him as a comic.

1491
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,558
But Galubert is dead.
Time to buy a fishing rod!

1492
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,393
He'll retire comfortably.
He has millions.

1493
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,879
So too will Irénée.

1494
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,678
Does that bother you?

1495
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,432
No. I'm glad for him.

1496
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,919
Anyway, where is he?

1497
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,640
He dressed up for the projection.

1498
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,872
Then hit by sudden nerves,
he's pacing the corridors.

1499
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,589
He won't attend the projection.
But I prefer that.

1500
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,990
Why are they laughing so much?

1501
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,396
Must be that idiot Galubert.

1502
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,912
At least they're having fun.

1503
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,152
But if that's the case,
my love scene won't move them.

1504
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,072
They'll probably laugh at that!

1505
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,356
Especially as...
Oh, if they laugh, it's the end!

1506
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,080
At least I can fall back
on the grocery.

1507
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,510
I'll have to... Françoise!

1508
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,749
- You did it!
- What?

1509
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,751
- They applauded twice.
- Who?

1510
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,036
- You. Personally.
- My love scene?

1511
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,918
That hasn't come yet.

1512
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,991
- Will they like it?
- I'm sure.

1513
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,229
I'm sure too.

1514
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,470
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely!

1515
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,039
Will they cry?

1516
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,792
Let me be first to tell you
what you'll surely hear later.

1517
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,713
The film will be a huge hit.

1518
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,952
But maybe not in the way
that you think.

1519
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,349
A hit for all but me?

1520
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,273
No. You're a complete smash!

1521
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,756
But there are several scenes...

1522
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,191
the ones you'd call emotional...

1523
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,475
The main ones!

1524
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,393
Well, they're having a huge impact.

1525
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,109
But they're inducing
emotions mixed...

1526
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,076
with comedy.

1527
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,232
- When I cry, they laugh?
- Not meanly.

1528
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,595
- But they laugh.
- Not grossly.

1529
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,919
In fact...

1530
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,955
the truth is,
you are a great comic actor!

1531
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,951
- Me?
- Yes. Everyone says so.

1532
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,749
The producers, the critics...
You're a revelation!

1533
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,072
They're looking for you now
to give you a contract.

1534
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,879
- And my love scene?
- Will make them laugh.

1535
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,794
- But I played it for real.
- And that's why.

1536
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,799
20 pm, the love scene.

1537
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,719
They're sitting there mocking me.

1538
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,757
There are different ways
of laughing.

1539
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,229
Of not laughing
and feeling sorrow too.

1540
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,790
Why should you feel sorrow?
You'll be rich and famous.

1541
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,520
So what?
My misfortune is the worst.

1542
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,399
Not achieving your aim
is true disappointment.

1543
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,950
But achieving the very opposite
of your aim

1544
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,476
is the absolute proof
that you're a total idiot.

1545
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,915
Untrue.
You never fully know yourself.

1546
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,437
Imagine an inventor who invents
a gun that fires further than others.

1547
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,239
At the first try,
the gun shoots backwards.

1548
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,472
The inventor,
so full of hope and pride,

1549
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,030
takes the bullet in his guts,
topples over and dies.

1550
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,760
Well my gun just backfired!

1551
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,030
I feel sadder than if I were dead.

1552
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,077
Your success will revive you.

1553
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,118
You think I'll accept success
as a comic? No way!

1554
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,235
Why not?

1555
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,791
Laugh. Make 'em laugh.
Become the king of laughter.

1556
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,629
It's less scary than the guillotine,
but equally defamatory.

1557
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,755
But why?

1558
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,470
Around 9 pm, after dining
with wives or mistresses,

1559
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,191
men will say, "Now we're replete
and the day's business is over,

1560
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,079
"let's watch a film
that will stop us thinking,

1561
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,958
"pose no problems

1562
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,396
"and shake up our guts
to help the digestion. "

1563
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,913
You exaggerate!

1564
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,399
No. It's even worse.

1565
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,074
What they want in a comic

1566
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,800
is a man that will make them
look better.

1567
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,236
So for the comic,
the make-up artist deepens a wrinkle.

1568
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,311
He accentuates a defect.

1569
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,359
Instead of correcting my face
and creating a superior being,

1570
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,876
he degrades him
with all the skills of his art.

1571
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,793
And if I'm a success as a comic,

1572
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,636
it will mean that throughout France,
every man will be able to say,

1573
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,032
"Tonight, I'm happy.
I saw and showed to my wife

1574
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,158
"a man uglier
and more stupid than I."

1575
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,269
And I'll have no success at all
with some educated people.

1576
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,835
Professors, doctors, priests...

1577
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,877
I'll never make them laugh.

1578
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,077
For their souls are so high
as to be moved by pity.

1579
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,198
Françoise, one man laughs at another,

1580
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,237
when he feels superior to him.

1581
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,834
The man who makes everyone laugh

1582
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,156
shows himself as inferior to all.

1583
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,392
- Only "shows". But he isn't.
- Why not?

1584
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,831
Because the actor isn't the man.

1585
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,072
You've seen Chaplin
having his butt kicked in films.

1586
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,198
Would the real Chaplin
accept so much as a slap?

1587
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,955
He's more likely to give them.
The real Chaplin is a leader.

1588
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,037
Then why debase himself?

1589
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:49,113
Those who make people laugh on film
don't debase themselves.

1590
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,191
Making laugh farm labourers

1591
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,079
with hands so calloused
they won't close.

1592
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,719
Or office workers

1593
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,190
whose shrunken lungs
have forgotten the taste of air.

1594
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,874
Or factory workers
with bowed heads,

1595
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:06,079
broken nails
and oil ingrained into their skin.

1596
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,356
Or those who are slowly dying.

1597
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,353
Or those who have lost their mother.

1598
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,479
- Who are these people?
- All of us. We all lose our mothers.

1599
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,757
He who, for an instant,
makes them forget misery,

1600
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,673
fatigue, anxiety and death,

1601
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,957
who makes them laugh
when they should cry,

1602
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,236
who gives them the strength to live,

1603
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,799
we love as a benefactor.

1604
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,600
Even if he debases himself
before them?

1605
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,548
If he agrees to debase himself,
he is even greater for it.

1606
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,078
Because he sacrifices pride
to lighten our loads.

1607
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,279
We should call them
Saint Molière and Saint Charlie!

1608
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,953
But laughter itself.

1609
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,839
It's an absurd, vulgar convulsion.

1610
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,718
Don't speak ill of laughter.

1611
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,072
It doesn't exist in the wild.

1612
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:55,677
Animals don't laugh,
trees don't laugh.

1613
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,912
Mountains have never laughed.
Only man...

1614
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,709
Man and babes
who haven't yet learnt to talk.

1615
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,396
Laughter is human.
The domain of man alone.

1616
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,156
Maybe a gift from God
to console us for being intelligent.

1617
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,117
When you played the lead
in this film, dear friend,

1618
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,998
it was an experiment.

1619
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:20,357
An expensive one,
as I invested one million.

1620
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,433
Not my million,
so not the end of the world!

1621
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,990
But you need courage
to risk other people's money.

1622
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,469
I agree. But others need it too.

1623
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,076
No, no! Backers never understand.

1624
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,874
As I risked this money
on an unknown,

1625
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,473
I didn't pay you much.

1626
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,835
8000 francs for 30 days
was lovely.

1627
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,709
No, it wasn't enough.
Because you played the part well.

1628
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,634
With its foreseen success,
I've rounded it up.

1629
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,152
I'll give you an immediate bonus
of 42,000 francs.

1630
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,837
That's an entirely honest total
of 50,000.

1631
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,912
And you deserve it.

1632
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,275
A gesture as correct
as it is generous.

1633
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,000
But first you must sign

1634
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,754
a piece of paper, a new contract.

1635
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,673
- Just show me where.
- Is it already drawn up?

1636
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,674
No, but he could sign the paper
and I'll sort it out later.

1637
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,273
He'll sort it out.

1638
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,559
Sort yourself out rather than be
sorted out by Mr Meyerboom.

1639
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,271
What are the new clauses?

1640
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,078
500,000 francs.

1641
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,794
- 500,000 just for me?
- Yes, for you.

1642
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,473
Half a million!

1643
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,755
Per film?

1644
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,674
No, for my life.
He's buying me for half a million.

1645
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,480
Impossible.
That would be totally nuts.

1646
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,837
I'm not buying him.
It's one year's salary.

1647
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,833
500,000 a year is too much
in my opinion.

1648
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,514
Here's a reasonable,
understanding man.

1649
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:47,195
Put yourself
in Mr Meyerboom's shoes.

1650
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,079
If I could make women weep,
I wouldn't refuse.

1651
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,389
But I'm a comic.

1652
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,836
If he risks 500,000
he'll never get it back.

1653
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,194
Let's get that straight.

1654
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,032
That's common sense.

1655
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,555
Are you sure my film will be a hit?

1656
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,234
- Of course not.
- See. Of course not.

1657
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,671
If you want to carry on
being a stupid schpountz,

1658
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,912
I'll go and leave you to it.

1659
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,674
No, please don't go, Françoise.

1660
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:13,795
Then shut up.

1661
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,473
Not so fast!

1662
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,749
Before signing a contract,

1663
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,229
you read it and think it over.

1664
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,552
Mr Meyerboom,
as you have guests waiting,

1665
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,359
you two go meet them
and leave me the papers.

1666
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,953
You can sign tomorrow.

1667
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,714
You're right.
After a good night's rest

1668
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,950
the mind is clearer

1669
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,680
and enthusiasm calms down.

1670
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,989
He'll change his mind.

1671
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,390
Only one bite at the cherry!

1672
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,869
Especially when I'm the cherry!

1673
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,592
Here's what I suggest.

1674
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,469
I'll get rid of the guests
while you read the contract

1675
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,074
and we'll conclude here later.
All right?

1676
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,993
I'd rather not go.
Too many people.

1677
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,434
And I'm bashful.

1678
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,593
He's right. Then I can give a speech
on the modesty of the triumphant.

1679
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,036
A private celebrity
is always a nice thing.

1680
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,952
Here's the contract.

1681
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,599
Here's the cheque.

1682
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,996
In the meantime, drink to me
with a glass of champagne.

1683
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,236
Mr Meyerboom,
isn't she amazingly intelligent?

1684
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,039
She might not be so for everyone!

1685
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,518
- What did he mean by that?
- No idea.

1686
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,712
I'm really pleased for him.

1687
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,552
He's a nice chap.

1688
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,472
And he'll go far.

1689
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,156
As long as he doesn't
marry a woman of course.

1690
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,197
Who should he marry then?

1691
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,717
I fear he may marry Françoise.

1692
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,753
I fear so too.

1693
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,592
Poor old thing.

1694
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,871
We'll lose two friends.

1695
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,912
Until their divorce.

1696
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,476
Because I cannot accept

1697
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:03,474
that a man and woman
can suffer cohabitation for long.

1698
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,549
Come on, let's go and drink.

1699
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,029
We'll drown our disillusions.

1700
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,955
Basically, it's a disastrous triumph.

1701
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,394
You could also call it
a triumphant disaster.

1702
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:24,199
500,000 a year is really something!

1703
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,109
I'm thinking of my uncle's face
when he learns I'll be rich,

1704
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,470
of my brother's joy,

1705
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,631
of my neighbours' admiration.

1706
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,190
Indeed it must be
a great joy for a man

1707
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:39,955
to leave his village poor
and return rich and famous.

1708
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,680
- It deserves to be seen.
- It does.

1709
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,398
Then come see it.

1710
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,831
- Me?
- Yes. Come with me.

1711
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,796
Where?

1712
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,758
Eoures. My village near Marseilles.

1713
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,799
- I can't.
- Your sweetheart would get mad?

1714
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,394
- He's jealous?
- No.

1715
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,073
- He watches you?
- No.

1716
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,037
- He's rich?
- No.

1717
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,589
What does he eat
and how does he dress?

1718
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,876
He neither eats nor dresses.

1719
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,800
You're mocking me.

1720
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,879
I am. I have no sweetheart
and never have had one.

1721
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,234
A maiden!

1722
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,708
A spinster!

1723
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,350
No... Spinsters have moustaches.

1724
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,158
And they kiss parrots.

1725
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,072
I see you as a maiden.

1726
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,157
But despite your immense intellect,

1727
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,359
it's amazing how silly you can be.

1728
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,669
Me?

1729
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,429
Yes, you.

1730
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,309
When you tell the whole canteen
you have a sweetheart,

1731
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,232
you don't realise

1732
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,877
you'll be giving some poor chap
a sleepless night.

1733
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:48,350
I'm talking about Astruc, Dromart
and the others,

1734
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,795
whom you've given sleepless nights.

1735
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,757
If not sleepless, then fitful.

1736
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,354
So why say you have a sweetheart?

1737
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,192
So no one is shocked.

1738
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:01,319
Well I'm not in the least shocked
you have no sweetheart.

1739
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:06,349
So where do you live and why
have none of your pals been there?

1740
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,875
Because I live with my mother.

1741
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,235
- Like a novel.
- No. Like real life.

1742
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,279
Then there's no one to stop you
going to the south with me.

1743
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,034
Now you're rich,
you think everyone else is.

1744
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,519
I have a job!

1745
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,359
Gimme a laugh!
Your job is to look after me.

1746
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,069
That contract for 100,000
or 50,000 or 350,000...

1747
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,435
or whatever, I can't remember!

1748
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,068
Is that money just for me?

1749
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,878
No. It's for us.

1750
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,918
As associates, of course.
Let's talk business.

1751
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,675
As a businessman,
I say half the money is yours.

1752
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,276
Otherwise I won't sign.
No, no and no again!

1753
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,431
Now I'm being cold.

1754
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,670
What job title is worth so much?

1755
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,319
The one you choose.

1756
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,755
I can't choose.
And what will Mother say?

1757
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,717
I'll see to her.

1758
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,348
I don't mean I'll strangle her.

1759
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,432
But I'll visit her,
once I know her address,

1760
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,991
and I'll say, "Madam, I'm Irénée. "
And she'll say, "Irénée who?"

1761
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,515
No. I've told her all about you.

1762
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,033
That'll make it easier.

1763
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,875
So I'll say,
"I'm Irénée and I'm rich. "

1764
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,349
She'll say,
"I know, my daughter said. "

1765
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:20,638
And I'll say, "I bet she didn't say
I owe everything to her. "

1766
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,676
Untrue!

1767
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,990
I'm not addressing you
but your mother!

1768
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,196
She'll say, "What do you want?"

1769
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,989
I'll say, "Will you give me
your daughter's hand...

1770
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,720
"in... in...

1771
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,078
"management. "

1772
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,391
- She'll think you want to wed me.
- If so, too bad.

1773
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,951
But if she gives me your hand,
I'll be obliged to keep it in mine.

1774
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,599
Would that please me?

1775
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,230
I don't know. I'm just saying
that by logic and reason

1776
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:53,235
I must offer you
a kind of conjugal partnership.

1777
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,552
As you know, I rarely play the guitar
beneath your window.

1778
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:01,156
I've no idea where your window is
and I can't play guitar!

1779
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,517
Without you, I can't manage in life.

1780
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,194
I need you.
As a businessman.

1781
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,715
This isn't a love scene,
so it's not comical.

1782
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,996
So let me say, in all sincerity,

1783
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,754
that it's necessary I marry you.

1784
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,069
Interesting, even.

1785
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,073
Being your husband
may not be paradise...

1786
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,631
I have no desire to kiss you.

1787
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,110
But not being your husband
would be a great inconvenience.

1788
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,477
So our marriage
will be based on reason.

1789
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,997
Reason?
No, that's too sad!

1790
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,754
If I ever get married,

1791
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,592
it will be for love.

1792
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,320
Then listen.
By forcing ourselves,

1793
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,790
applying ourselves
and suggesting to ourselves,

1794
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,837
let's have a love marriage.

1795
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,356
- Love doesn't happen like that.
- Of course it does.

1796
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,988
I'm telling you, if I force myself...

1797
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,991
If I force myself...

1798
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,513
I'd even kiss you.

1799
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,630
I said: If I force myself.

1800
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,233
Then don't.

1801
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,197
Fine. Only when I'm richer.

1802
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,191
Yes, you're not rich enough yet.

1803
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:07,238
What must I earn for you to say yes?

1804
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,833
Let's see...

1805
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,993
I'll marry you the day you have
a car like Mr Meyerboom's.

1806
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:14,912
That big, huge one?

1807
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,713
In that case,

1808
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,111
I'll work at being a great comic
in order to win you over.

1809
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,590
Perhaps that great desire
will give me the talent

1810
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,955
that I may not truly possess.

1811
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,952
Still talking as a businessman?

1812
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,829
Not as a businessman...
I'm just talking, talking,

1813
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,275
talking...
Pain in the butt!

1814
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,237
We've been waiting for you.

1815
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,231
Everything going well?

1816
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,189
Not exactly.
But nothing is going badly.

1817
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,835
Does the lawyer accept the contract?

1818
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,631
We agree.
But he would like one more thing.

1819
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,239
Actors are big children,
with caprices and desires.

1820
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,949
What is it?

1821
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,674
Tell him.

1822
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,279
Me?

1823
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,273
I'm not entirely sure.

1824
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,078
You daren't tell him?

1825
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,629
Then I will.
He'd like, on signing...

1826
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,234
Yes, he'd like, on signing...

1827
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,469
What does he want?

1828
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,596
He'd like to have your car.

1829
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,478
What? My car?

1830
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,711
No. She's kidding!

1831
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,953
What? You don't want
Mr Meyerboom's car right away?

1832
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,950
Of course I do.
I now realise I do.

1833
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,395
I'll do 6 films for free
in exchange.

1834
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,835
- Agreed.
- No. The car's a gift.

1835
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,031
And what a gift!

1836
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,830
A gift that could end up
wound round a tree.

1837
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,798
For one month,
you can have my chauffeur too.

1838
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,837
Now sign.

1839
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,110
I really don't understand you.

1840
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,912
Are all these props necessary?

1841
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,594
Yes, because they make me happy.

1842
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,115
If I go home, dressed like this,

1843
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,271
with you, in that car,

1844
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:49,955
I'll never find them
just how they used to be.

1845
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,589
If I go home alone,

1846
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,831
in my old suit,

1847
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:59,638
and spring my success on them,
then it's more...

1848
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,313
More dramatic.

1849
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:06,831
Isn't it natural for an actor
to want to be dramatic?

1850
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,188
You'll see.

1851
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,196
Wait here. I'll be back.

1852
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,157
Hide under a dust-cover.

1853
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,919
This makes me laugh.

1854
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,957
Not me. I'm all emotional.

1855
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,155
Why?

1856
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,393
- What if they won't see me?
- You come back here very quickly.

1857
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,749
Indeed!

1858
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,350
What if I changed back
and you came with me?

1859
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,589
If you like.

1860
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:36,150
Then they'd look on me as a success.

1861
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,949
And I'd think they'd welcomed me
because of the car.

1862
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,473
Naturally.

1863
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,151
In that case, I'll go like this.

1864
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,150
If I go like this,
they'll see me as a disaster.

1865
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,073
Then I'd say
they gave me a bad welcome...

1866
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,312
a bad welcome, because I'm poor.

1867
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,754
Then I'd think...

1868
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,592
Hurry up and go.

1869
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,749
But my thinking!

1870
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,559
You're not thinking
of anything at all.

1871
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,674
Go and get on with your experiment.
But hurry. I'll wait here.

1872
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,077
Hey, what about me?

1873
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,913
I can't kiss you,
the waiter's watching.

1874
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,469
You've every right to kiss your wife.

1875
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,949
Legally, yes.
But what if he's thinking,

1876
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:21,272
"Why is that daft comic kissing
that beautiful, intelligent woman?"

1877
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,637
I'm not beautiful
and you're not daft.

1878
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,517
- What will you do while I'm gone?
- Write to my mother.

1879
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,989
- Your mother?
- Yes, of course!

1880
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,476
Then we're not properly wed.

1881
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,154
You'll write to "our" mother!

1882
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,558
And I'm going to check out
"our" uncle.

1883
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:43,914
Very well.

1884
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,471
And don't smoke too much.

1885
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,518
Because you're married now.

1886
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,278
Is that you?

1887
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,437
It is. Hello, Uncle.

1888
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,792
Hey, Casimir!
Come and see a ghost from the past!

1889
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,996
I'm no ghost, I'm me.

1890
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,550
Irénée, at last!

1891
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,917
- Are you well?
- Yes. As you see.

1892
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,389
As we see.
He's lost weight, eh?

1893
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,709
Hungry, I guess.

1894
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,235
No, I'm not. I had a late lunch.

1895
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,278
Tell me the truth.
You're not hungry?

1896
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,839
No, really.

1897
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,230
If you're hungry, just say.

1898
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,949
If I was hungry, I'd say.
I had a big lunch at two.

1899
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,553
- Too bad.
- Why?

1900
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,870
- It ruins my plan.
- Which was?

1901
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,235
I always knew you'd be back.

1902
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,391
- How?
- Common sense.

1903
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:52,156
When a clown goes out into the world
with only a pea for a brain,

1904
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,790
it always ends with the crackpot
coming home.

1905
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:00,192
- And if he's too broke to return?
- There's always a way to get home!

1906
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,716
The Marseilles Embassy in Paris.
Other family members did it.

1907
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,440
They repatriated your dad
several times.

1908
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,716
From Mauritius, Hong Kong,

1909
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,758
and once from Latin America...
Colombia...

1910
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,831
or Guatemala.

1911
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,198
Anyway, some godforsaken country.

1912
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,915
And I was right,
because you're here.

1913
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:24,038
Only I thought,
as he's proud and pretentious,

1914
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,430
he'd only return as a last resort.

1915
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,309
I saw him crossing the threshold
on a winter's night,

1916
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,597
pale, teeth chattering and starving.

1917
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,910
I'd approach him wordlessly.

1918
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,275
No screams, no slaps.

1919
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,113
I'd take his hand,
sit him down in the corner,

1920
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,915
then still without a word

1921
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,277
I'd open a tin of foie gras.

1922
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,431
- New?
- New!

1923
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:55,229
Then I'd grill two sausages
with rosemary.

1924
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:58,870
He'd eat for a long time in silence.

1925
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,989
Then he'd turn to me,
his eyes filled with tears,

1926
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,873
and I'd say...

1927
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,233
"You daft twerp...

1928
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,998
"come give me a hug. "

1929
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,992
You could still say it.

1930
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,230
No. It wouldn't be natural!

1931
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,470
That's not how I planned it.

1932
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,358
That's your fault too!

1933
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:22,513
Prodigal sons usually return
sad and thin on winter nights.

1934
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:26,593
You return replete and happy
on a spring afternoon!

1935
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,751
You can't do anything normally!

1936
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,989
Come on...

1937
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,433
Come in, anyway.

1938
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,268
Try not to make Auntie cry.

1939
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,279
Come on then.

1940
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,871
- You borrowed money for the journey?
- I was lent it.

1941
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:49,794
Tell me his name and address
so I can send the money back.

1942
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,313
It's a friend.

1943
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,436
Don't want to tell me?

1944
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,398
Then I'll give you the money
and you send it.

1945
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,389
Casimir, the bottle of Muscat
and the big glasses!

1946
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,790
He can tell us all his adventures.

1947
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,951
Sit down, Clarisse.

1948
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:09,269
So off you went to Paris,
clutching your famous contract.

1949
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,995
You took it to the office.

1950
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,311
But they'd played a trick on you.

1951
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,198
- A trick?
- Right.

1952
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:17,555
Bastards!

1953
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,632
They met a fool
and had fun with him, that's all.

1954
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,438
- Exactly.
- What next?

1955
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,794
They threw me out.

1956
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,712
Into the street?

1957
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,233
No, the pavement.

1958
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,118
- Well I never!
- Imagine...

1959
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,875
- Alone in Paris...
- And broke!

1960
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:35,191
Broke, yes. Alone, no.
I was with the gay tricksters!

1961
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,316
- Who were remorseful.
- Almost.

1962
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,550
- And they fed you.
- Yes.

1963
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,516
For a year?

1964
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:44,639
No. They found him a job.
Clerk, cleaner, doorman...

1965
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:45,955
Pretty much.

1966
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,554
He made a modest living

1967
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:52,918
but hope of some minor success
still gently burnt.

1968
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:54,638
Did hope gently burn?

1969
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,074
It barely simmered.

1970
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,559
Just as I thought.

1971
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,632
The flame of this hope
gradually began to die.

1972
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,711
And when it finally went out,

1973
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:07,271
Irénée thought,
"I'll return to the grocery. "

1974
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,276
Exactly.

1975
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:11,193
You're amazing!
You second-guess everything.

1976
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,954
You've known me
a long time, Clarisse.

1977
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,078
And now...

1978
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,628
let's drink to my perps...
my presp...

1979
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,631
my pers-pic-a-city!

1980
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,349
It may be hard to say,
but it's a precious quality.

1981
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:31,116
Then indeed I do drink
to your pers-pers-perspicacity.

1982
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,355
Now sit down.

1983
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,470
It's now necessary,
to make things clear,

1984
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,030
that I sum up the situation
in a family speech.

1985
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,671
Poor Irénée is back.

1986
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,678
You departed, head high and crowing.

1987
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,319
You return, head bowed,

1988
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,472
totally stunned
by life's hard lesson.

1989
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,154
You now unquestioningly know

1990
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,959
you're a hopeless,
crazy good-for-nothing.

1991
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,031
A human shipwreck.

1992
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,431
But I have tact
and I won't remind you of that.

1993
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,157
Thank you, Uncle.
But one supposition.

1994
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,359
If I had become rich and famous,
what would you have said?

1995
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,954
- I'd have fallen on my arse!
- Not me.

1996
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:21,837
Shut up!

1997
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,719
If you'd succeeded
in a career I'd discouraged

1998
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,678
you'd say it was due to a gift.

1999
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,399
A god-given gift.

2000
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:33,474
And as his uncle hadn't seen it,
he'd be a real twerp.

2001
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,995
You didn't try to stop me leaving!

2002
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,675
But I couldn't hold you back!
But if you'd succeeded...

2003
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,758
What's this all about?
You couldn't succeed.

2004
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:46,356
<i>I'm no connoisseur,
but I can't see you in Faust.</i>

2005
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,954
Save for Act I with the long beard.

2006
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,271
Another supposition.
If I'd succeeded as a comic

2007
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,351
and become a great comic actor...

2008
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,795
- I wouldn't let you in.
- Why not?

2009
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,269
This is a grocery,
but we're honourable.

2010
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,112
No fart-arses in here!

2011
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,829
I might go to see him,
but he wouldn't perform here.

2012
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:09,028
Imagine our good name of Fabre
on a poster for tomfoolery!

2013
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,636
Imagine a Fabre
skiving off real work!

2014
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,279
God forbid!

2015
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,475
Why?

2016
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:19,110
The name of your father and mine
borne by a clown!

2017
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,952
No way!

2018
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:24,949
Anyway, thank God,
you didn't succeed at anything.

2019
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,237
Though perhaps,
with time and patience,

2020
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,595
you might make a grocer.

2021
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,592
So you'd take me in?

2022
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,389
Would I throw you onto the pavement
like those others?

2023
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,232
I never gave you a contract.

2024
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,710
But you have an unwritten one
which is no trick.

2025
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,758
Thank you, Uncle.

2026
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:45,952
There is one other thing.

2027
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,078
- He's in debt!
- No. Even worse.

2028
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,351
I got married.

2029
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:56,959
A Parisienne?

2030
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,314
Yep!

2031
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,952
- As rich as you?
- About.

2032
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:02,189
Is she in Paris?

2033
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:05,432
No. At the bar on the corner.

2034
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,354
- Shall I fetch her?
- No, Casimir! I'll go myself.

2035
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,874
Incredible! Irénée married!

2036
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,399
And penniless!

2037
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,717
Just like his poor dad.

2038
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,679
Who on earth could this girl be?

2039
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,994
Wait in the street
next to the church.

2040
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:30,199
When I signal, drive slowly
past the grocery on your right.

2041
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,634
Very good, sir.

2042
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,549
I can't wait.

2043
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,313
- Me neither.
- Nor me.

2044
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,674
Here they are.

2045
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,551
It's the lady with the film crowd!

2046
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,439
- Exactly. Hello, Casimir.
- Here she is.

2047
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,637
- This is your wife?
- It is.

2048
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,837
I mean, you're married, wed?

2049
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,992
Married, blessed,
loved and cherished.

2050
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,317
- She's never worked in a store?
- Never.

2051
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,790
We'll have to educate her.

2052
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,709
I'm not displeased with her.
What's her name?

2053
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:09,872
- Fabre.
- What a coincidence!

2054
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,075
She has the same name as us!

2055
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:17,233
She has the same name as us
because she's my wife!

2056
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,833
How silly of me!

2057
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,676
No, Clarisse. She didn't understand.
What's her Christian name?

2058
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,591
Françoise.

2059
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,309
Françoise, I don't know you
and should be suspicious.

2060
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,999
When a Parisienne enters
a Marseilles family, it's a big thing.

2061
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:37,074
It's even bigger
when that family owns a store.

2062
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,559
I'll say something
which may seem ridiculous

2063
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,153
but which is true.

2064
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:47,030
If we want people to trust us,
we must give them our trust first.

2065
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:50,160
I give you my trust.

2066
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,318
Françoise, have a seat.

2067
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,794
From today,
this house is as much yours

2068
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,029
as it is ours.

2069
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,350
Sit, Françoise.
Thank you, Uncle.

2070
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:04,917
- I'll never forget this.
- Go and sit down.

2071
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,831
You were with the pranksters

2072
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,479
who gave him that contract?

2073
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,868
Yes, I was.

2074
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,032
Well he played
an even bigger joke on you.

2075
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:16,916
Why?

2076
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:20,709
He's big-hearted,
but he doesn't have much up top.

2077
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,993
And in a grocery, you need a lot.

2078
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,475
- You've decided to make an effort?
- I have.

2079
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,473
A big effort that will surprise you.

2080
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,836
I'm not asking for surprises.

2081
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,991
You know what I want.

2082
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,229
No. What?

2083
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,391
To never leave the basket...

2084
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,470
of croissants...

2085
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,789
under the tap...

2086
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,552
of the oil can.

2087
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:46,234
OK. It'll never happen again.

2088
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:50,474
So you want to put all your heart
into your work?

2089
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,029
All of it!

2090
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:54,475
Here they both are in the grocery!

2091
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,235
You may not like it much,
but you'll have to get used to it.

2092
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,790
To help you, I'll show you something.

2093
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,394
Something very important.

2094
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,673
The last letter I received
from my brother.

2095
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,068
Their father.

2096
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,150
"Dear Baptiste... " That's me.

2097
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,439
"I'm in Niamey... " That's in Africa.

2098
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,793
"... where I thought I would find
riches in gold dust and ivory.

2099
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,279
"I found neither.

2100
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,591
"However,
I have contracted appendicitis,

2101
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:32,036
"as one would in Aix or Grenoble... "
Such fantasy!

2102
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,158
"A young army doctor
will operate in his tent.

2103
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,788
"He advised me to write a will. "
Here it is.

2104
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:42,112
"I bequeath all I own,
which is mostly debts.

2105
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,474
"See attached list. "

2106
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,036
Where is it?

2107
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,714
I tore it up.
It wasn't much. Only scrap.

2108
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:52,237
A rifle, two suits
and 100 francs to the local café.

2109
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:56,029
- He owed us the most...
- Shut up, Clarisse!

2110
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:00,114
I paid off what he owed me
in blood, sweat and tears.

2111
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:03,352
So the debt doesn't exist
and never has.

2112
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:08,114
"I leave you my sons,
which doesn't change things much.

2113
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,029
"You've raised them
since their mother died.

2114
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,317
"Watch Irénée closely.
He's big-hearted,

2115
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:17,836
"but he's almost as nuts as I."
Quite true!

2116
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,068
"I also leave you
my thanks and affection.

2117
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,590
"You've always been a fine brother.

2118
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,318
"In guise of thanks,

2119
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,438
"I've often despised your profession

2120
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,596
"and mocked your grocery.

2121
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:34,036
"With my life in danger,
I admit that of the two of us

2122
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,474
"you were right.

2123
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,871
"My idle wanderings,
pretentiousness and vanity

2124
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,838
"may come to an end
in a tent in darkest Africa.

2125
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,718
"Which is quite absurd.

2126
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:46,680
"You're in back our village,

2127
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,594
"consoling your lack of children
by raising mine.

2128
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:55,352
"But you know, brother, it's not
ridiculous to slice saucisson

2129
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,511
"if you do it for someone else.

2130
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:00,752
"Life is as short
as an African dusk.

2131
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:03,753
"Those who aim too high
often achieve nothing.

2132
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,834
"So, as my good doctor
sharpens his scalpel,

2133
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:13,108
"I wanted to tell you that your life
is beautiful, happy and noble.

2134
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:17,233
"Because you have achieved
your goal, however humble it is,

2135
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,392
"with confidence and good humour.

2136
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:24,274
"You know the peaceful greenery
of our village,

2137
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:28,513
"the glory of usefulness
and the honour to serve.

2138
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,158
"With all my love.

2139
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,474
"Your brother, Edmond Fabre. "

2140
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:37,116
Our father wrote that?

2141
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,870
- An hour before his death.
- Why have you never read it?

2142
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,799
Because it speaks too well of me.

2143
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:49,670
Plus you didn't want to be a grocer,
and that letter lauds grocers.

2144
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,559
You'd have said
I was fishing for my saint.

2145
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,470
What saint?

2146
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:56,154
The patron saints of grocers
are very few:

2147
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,276
Saint-Emilion, Saint-Marcellin...

2148
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:02,752
They're edible and drinkable,
but they're saints nonetheless.

2149
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,837
Anyway, that's enough philosophy.

2150
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,309
Now let's talk seriously.

2151
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,070
We recently divided up the business.

2152
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:14,549
That means the grocery can grow.

2153
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:16,790
And now there are five of us!

2154
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,078
I plan to buy Mr Arnaud's stable
for a new store.

2155
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:25,313
By mortgaging the house
and my business,

2156
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:26,993
I can pay it right off.

2157
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:30,118
- How much is he asking?
- 18,000 francs.

2158
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,189
I don't have it.

2159
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:35,079
I've scrimped and saved
but only have 12,000.

2160
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,992
Why only 12,000?

2161
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:40,118
Because you raised
your brother's sons.

2162
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,475
What else could I do?

2163
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,029
Many would've said,
"They're not mine.

2164
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,794
"They can go to an orphanage. "

2165
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,589
See how stupid I am?
I didn't even consider it.

2166
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:54,912
So before your eyes,
every day, every hour,

2167
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,799
we gobbled up Mr Arnaud's stable.

2168
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,918
One day, one wall.
The next, twelve tiles.

2169
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,992
One day, the door.
The next, the trough.

2170
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:07,277
We scoffed all of Mr Arnaud's stable.

2171
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,759
It wasn't nice of us.

2172
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,831
It wasn't.
Listen, Uncle...

2173
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,719
You want Mr Arnaud's stable,
it's yours.

2174
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,791
I'll buy it for you.

2175
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:20,351
And if you like, I'll buy Mr Arnaud
with his pipe and pince-nez!

2176
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,999
Irénée, stop it.

2177
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:23,992
Don't start that again!

2178
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,708
Uncle, don't worry about a thing.

2179
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,589
I'll prove it to you
right in front of your own door!

2180
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:34,154
What's going on?
Why's she laughing?

2181
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,594
I'm very worried.

2182
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,957
The pea has finally split.

2183
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,796
- Well?
- Well wait!

2184
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,359
Wait for what?

2185
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,636
Give me a few seconds.

2186
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,035
Not a total waste of time!
Casimir!

2187
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:00,236
Bring the petrol pump handle!

2188
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,836
American. If he's going to Aubagne,
we sell the rubbish.

2189
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:07,277
It's not American
and it doesn't guzzle gas.

2190
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:10,273
Since when do you know about cars?

2191
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:13,594
I'm no connoisseur,
but I know this one...

2192
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,673
because it's mine.

2193
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,676
What?

2194
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,470
Lucien, leave the car here
and wait for orders at the café.

2195
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:23,109
Don't tell me...

2196
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,829
No, not here.
No family scenes in public.

2197
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,115
Inside.

2198
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:37,749
Closed for interesting conversation!

2199
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,238
This must be a stolen car.

2200
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:47,156
If you have a contract
for 700,000 francs,

2201
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:48,833
why this old suit?

2202
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,834
A disguise. I wanted to know
how you'd welcome me.

2203
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:56,029
It's nothing.
A fake moustache.

2204
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,272
Make-up.
Stuck on hair by hair.

2205
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:02,155
How handsome he looks!

2206
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:04,158
Very true!

2207
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:06,237
- Despite looking like you.
- Thanks.

2208
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:10,317
- Do you make women weep?
- No.

2209
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,789
- You're the bad guy?
- No.

2210
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,393
- You don't sing?
- No.

2211
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:17,120
- What are you then?
- The clown.

2212
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,633
I make them laugh.

2213
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:19,829
Shall I leave now?

2214
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,672
- Why?
- He said it.

2215
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:25,549
No. I said: The name Fabre
on a poster for tomfoolery.

2216
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,517
I didn't say: The name Irénée.

2217
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,352
You get a lot of laughs?

2218
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,636
I'll say. People are in stitches.

2219
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,472
I earned 50,000 for it.

2220
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,393
50,000 means a comedy,
not tomfoolery!

2221
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,959
- So Irénée is your stage name?
- Yes.

2222
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:43,351
That's not your full name.
You're Irénée Fabre.

2223
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,953
But I thought you said...

2224
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,918
When this poster was painted,
I hadn't spoken.

2225
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:52,073
So by some inadvertency,
a contract of 500,000 francs,

2226
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:53,878
you can put Fabre.

2227
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,554
Fabre is so common,
no one would know

2228
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,756
it was us, unless we told them.

2229
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,718
- And you'd tell them.
- Only my pals.

2230
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,472
There's room for it.

2231
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:07,030
Because Irénée alone
looks a bit pretentious.

2232
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,033
If you involve the family,
it seems more modest.

2233
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:14,273
- I'm just saying that for your sake.
- Right. For my sake!

2234
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,429
The car!

2235
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,875
It must be those pesky kids...

2236
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:19,268
I'll go.

2237
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:28,632
The first one to honk the horn
gets a kick up the butt!

2238
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:32,071
The second, two kicks.
The third, three kicks.

2239
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,800
The fourth, four kicks.
And so on.

2240
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,272
All of them up the butt!

2241
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:51,033
