1
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,833
Nothing in this world will have as many
barbed wire fences around as love does.

2
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,583
Nothing comes close to love in
being the cause of many great wars.

3
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:50,208
In a field beyond time,
tradition, winning and losing...

4
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,958
Love stands alone, shining bright.

5
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,083
Are you done?

6
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,458
Mom, get me a haircut. I should look
like Chiranjeevi. Will you get me one?

7
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,791
Make it fast. It's getting late.

8
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,875
Mom see that photo… I
need a haircut like that.

9
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,958
Mom, look at me...

10
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,333
He should cut here...
and here... Mom, look at me.

11
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,916
Here and here...

12
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,583
Hey, wait… Your place
is not here… Go there…

13
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,625
You know how it works, right Manamma?
Teach your kid! Go there.

14
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,833
Not there… here it seems.
As though the village is his…

15
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,166
Sit… Just because you went there.
Why did you go?

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,125
May he burn!
May he have wounds in his hands!

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,000
We, who work hard,
have no entry inside. Shut up!

18
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,041
Mom, why can’t we go in?

19
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,041
That's how it is.
Because they are different from us.

20
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,583
This won't change until
that difference exists.

21
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,291
-Sir, I’ll payback in 3 months, sir
-You fail to pay interest? Take your kid.

22
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,916
You won’t pay back loans.
We can’t snatch your fields.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,166
-What else can we do? Take this away.
- Don’t take away the door, sir.

24
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,166
-Oh, God! Such a tough time, Manamma!
-Don't cry, mom.

25
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,041
Be strong, Manamma.

26
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,208
Mom… It would have been
great if dad is alive, right?

27
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,500
I’m still alive, right?

28
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,791
We have to
get back our field within a year.

29
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,958
How, mom?

30
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,291
What ‘How’?

31
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,291
If we are out of money, we have to work.

32
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,875
We have to work and earn money.
That’s the rule.

33
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,833
Revanth, I heard that
you are not attending school!

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125
Your mom is complaining that
you are dancing on the roads.

35
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,541
-I will study, teacher.
-Take this.

36
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,625
-You have to complete it.
-Ok, teacher.

37
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,375
-Mom, until here?
-Up to there.

38
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,166
Did we get our field back?

39
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,166
Yeah, we got back our field.

40
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,416
Our Revanth is killing it!

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,416
Hey, come here. Show me your hand.

42
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,625
For me?

43
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,875
Thank you, sir.

44
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,625
Mom mom, I danced well.
Narsimham sir gave me a rupee.

45
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,250
I have earned a name in the
school, and also some money.

46
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
Now there will be no differences!

47
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,375
How did he give? Did he place
it in your hands? Or did he drop it?

48
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,583
He dropped it.

49
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,291
Did you see it?

50
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,125
How can you call it a prize?

51
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,166
He threw it at you without any respect.

52
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,500
Remember this, son.

53
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,083
For these differences to end...

54
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,833
We have to give them money one day.
Our hand should be on the top.

55
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,416
You have to work really hard for that.

56
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,416
House, land, job, mindset...
Whatever it is.

57
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,791
We have to lead a better life.

58
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,541
Our hand has to give
money, not take it.

59
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,458
Dheeru, get up.

60
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,291
Dheeru, it’s time… Get up.

61
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,875
Come fast!

62
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,041
Let's go.

63
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,791
“Burn fat… Get fit… Do Zumba”… Start.

64
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,458
Again again…

65
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,666
Jump jump…

66
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,583
Superb! x5

67
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,666
This has to reduce, sir.

68
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,333
This? Ok ok, let’s try something
in the next class, madam.

69
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,375
-Thank you.
-Thank you, madam.

70
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,166
-Morning, sir.
-Anu ma’am… tell me.

71
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,958
Sir, that’s… My husband asked
me not to pay the fee, sir.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,958
He said I haven’t reduced a
bit, and not to pay the fee.

73
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,708
-Is it ok, sir?
-Haa… How can that be?

74
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,916
Did we give you a guarantee? Should we
teach you Zumba without payment now?

75
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,791
-You can stop coming.
-Hey, let me handle this.

76
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,541
How can you say that it’s our
fault, madam?

77
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,583
-Even you have to try, right?
-I did, sir.

78
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,416
-‘Try’? Seriously?
-But it still didn’t work.

79
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,833
Won’t move your legs or hands. You just
stand still, staring at people around you.

80
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
-How will you reduce?
-Mind your voice!

81
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,125
I have video proof.
Do you want to see it?

82
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,958
-Is it? Show me.
-Stop making a scene.

83
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,375
Bro, wait.
See… See how she’s working out. See…

84
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,875
Sir that’s not me.

85
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,958
- Not me.
-Yeah, please don’t feel bad.

86
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,583
Hey, how can you behave rashly with
the clients? Go sit in silence.

87
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,375
It’s ok, madam. Let’s change your
workout routine.

88
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,458
Pay us only if you like it. Ok… No
problem at all.

89
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,750
-See you tomorrow, madam.
-Sir...

90
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,208
First, fire this short fellow and hire
a girl, sir. He has no manners at all!

91
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,375
-Leave now… Go.
-Get lost, idiot!

92
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,250
What’s with you brother? As if we
gave her a guarantee or something.

93
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,666
How can you let her go without paying? It’s
tough for Goddess Lakshmi to favour you.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,666
No matter what I do,
your Goddess Lakshmi won’t favour me.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,083
Right!

96
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,500
Who’s the God of Wealth in Christianity?

97
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,541
The bank manager is
our God of Wealth.

98
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,375
Once he approves our loan,
we can escape all this mess.

99
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,083
Hey, did you guys come there?

100
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,875
Yeah, he called me, brother.
They are waiting for us at the bank.

101
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,125
-We have to be there on time.
-Ok, brother.

102
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,041
Revanth… Wait wait…

103
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,041
What did you do about the drainage?

104
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,000
I have been asking about it for 3 days…
You are taking me very lightly you know…

105
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,791
No, sir.
Yesterday was a holiday, sir.

106
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,916
Today I have some work at the bank.
I’ll get it done.

107
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,416
Ok, go go... Even I have some work to do.

108
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:53,083
The tuition center guys complained
against your Mumba for sound pollution.

109
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,750
-I will have to talk to them…
-It’s not Mumba, sir. It’s Zumba.

110
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Whatever… It’s sound pollution.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,833
I’ll be on your work tomorrow.
This is really urgent. I’ll get it done.

112
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,458
-Ok, go go.
-Don't leave them this time.

113
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,208
-When will we leave this place?
-Bro...

114
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,291
-One minute...
-Let the loan get sanctioned.

115
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,750
-We’ll rent a new place near the main road.
-If that happens, we HAVE to celebrate!

116
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,583
All your papers are perfect…
You’ll get the loan.

117
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,375
But it will take six months.
And 50 thousand.

118
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,500
[all]: 50 thousand?

119
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,916
For what, sir?

120
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,500
To bring you into progress.

121
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,458
-Into what, sir?
-Up!

122
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,083
How can that be progress, sir?

123
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,583
Buy a new riksha to a rikshwala,
he will still be a riksawala.

124
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,958
Where’s progress in that, sir?

125
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,375
Of course, you are right. But the
government fixed this. What can we do?

126
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,000
I started from level zero, sir!
I managed to put up my own Zumba center.

127
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:44,125
I work really hard sir. I even have a
great plan. Do something, sir. Please.

128
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,125
Sir our business is clear sir.

129
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,750
These days everyone is suffering from fat,
overweight, stress, strain, and thyroid.

130
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,833
If we ask them to spend money on their
health instead of on hospital bills…

131
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,375
They will form queues in front
of our Zumba center, sir.

132
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,875
Of course, you are convincing me.
But you can’t convince the bank, right?

133
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,958
Do this, bring some
property papers as security.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I’ll make sure you’ll get
the loan as soon as possible.

135
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,250
As if we any properties, sir!

136
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,958
You have a half-acre land
in your village, right?

137
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,958
That belongs to my mom.
She won’t agree to this.

138
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,000
How can the bank believe in
you, if your own mother doesn’t?

139
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,875
Our land? I’ll kill you both if
you even try to talk about my land.

140
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,916
-I bought it with the money I saved starving.
-God, stop it!

141
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,666
I don't want it. I was just telling
you what he said. As if I don’t care!

142
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,916
Ok... Did you guys eat?

143
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,875
Rajesh keeps asking for
Haleem… Get him some. Ok?

144
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,791
Brother...

145
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,750
How shall we pay the rent?
We even lost some customers.

146
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,000
Brother, bring the shovel. Fast.

147
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,625
Brother, he’s asking for the shovel.

148
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,583
Brother brother hello hello…
Brother… Brother, my name is Sunny.

149
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
I need a part-time job at
your Zumba center, brother.

150
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,541
I’ll come in the morning. I’ll clean the
room, I’ll prepare breakfast, make tea.

151
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,541
I’ll do whatever you want me to… I
don’t even need any salary, brother.

152
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,000
-You don't need a salary?
-Huh.

153
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,500
But you’ll give us tea.

154
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,000
Do I look that foolish to you?

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,208
Do you think I don’t know why you want
to be here? You are here for Geetha.

156
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,750
I’ll thrash you if I see
you around again. Get lost!

157
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,041
-Brother, please...
-Hey, get lost!

158
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,333
-At least you tell him.
-Go!

159
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,458
-Is it done with, brother?
-Go!

160
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,458
-It won’t cause problems, right?
-No no.

161
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,416
Let's go.

162
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,000
It's done, sir.

163
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,041
It shouldn’t leak again.

164
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,166
No no, it won’t, sir.

165
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,166
Did you get the loan?

166
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,333
We will, sir. Soon.

167
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,500
I rented the space to you,
as you’ll be of help to us.

168
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,250
But you are not paying the
rent from last two months.

169
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Hey, stop. Stop stop! Here here…

170
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,666
This is the house. Stop stop!

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,416
You have to say that a bit
earlier, madam.

172
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,458
Hey, you didn’t give back the five.

173
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,708
Five?

174
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,750
I don’t have any change.
Give me five, and I’ll give you ten.

175
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,958
I don’t have a five.

176
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,125
-I don’t have a five.
-What should I do?

177
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,791
No change. Ma'am, why are you
making a scene just for five rupees?

178
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,750
I am saying that I don’t have
change, right?

179
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,833
-You have to.
-Is it?

180
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,208
Is this your house?

181
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,625
Go get a five. I’ll wait here. Go.

182
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,666
Wait here. I’ll be back.

183
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,916
Yes, I’ll wait. You go.

184
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,083
Where do these people come
from, just to irritate others!

185
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,958
Brother… My five rupees!

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,125
You thief!

187
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,166
Mouni, what’s with this sudden visit?

188
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,333
I’ll tell you…

189
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,666
What happened to your leg?

190
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,833
Nothing. That auto driver is heartless.
He stole my five rupees.

191
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,791
Five rupees?

192
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,958
He’s not heartless, you are voiceless.

193
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,250
You have to make a scene and catch him
by his collar. Want to have some tea?

194
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,875
No. I haven’t brushed yet.

195
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,791
Kavya called me saying that they
have openings in their office.

196
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,875
She even sent me the question paper.
This job is mine!

197
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,916
Thank God. Best!
You have to throw a huge party this time.

198
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,666
God, let me get the job,
I will throw whatever you want.

199
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,375
I am dying here.

200
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,041
Did you parents say ‘Yes’?

201
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,625
Was very difficult.

202
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,750
I cried and made a scene.

203
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,041
Mom managed to talk down dad.

204
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,416
But my grandma and that anaconda tried
to stop me until the last minute.

205
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,333
-Anaconda?
-My uncle…

206
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,541
Ok.

207
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:55,416
He gave me one month. If I don’t
bag this job… it's back to maid duties.

208
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,958
Did you prepare the answers?

209
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,458
-Poor girl, she even sent me the answers.
-Is it?

210
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
I learnt them by heart.

211
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,291
I have to get the same paper
and my job is guaranteed.

212
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,375
I have to just manage the interview.

213
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,166
You’ll get the same paper.

214
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,791
Hey, I’m getting late for my class.

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,541
Hey, I’m feeling really tensed.
Tell me something nice.

216
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,166
Mouni you can do this… You can
do this… You can do this… OK?

217
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,125
Bye!

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
Well done! x4

219
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,333
-Arent't you ready yet?
-Ask the fees, brother.

220
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,750
On the way.

221
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,708
-Go see.
-I’m coming. Did you revise?

222
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,375
-Is she your friend?
-Yes, sir.

223
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,666
Get her also to join. She’s in a lot of
stress. I saw her at the auto this morning.

224
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,833
Eh, she won’t join, sir.

225
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,958
Come on, get her to join and
you can just pay 1500 for each.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,958
She has some other problems, sir.
She’s in job search. She won’t join.

227
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,583
Is it? Ok,
let’s ask her once she gets a job.

228
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,708
Ok, sir.

229
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,833
-What is this? What’s with this sound?
-Sir, we are done. Done!

230
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,166
Please come, sir.

231
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,541
-Ok?
-Yes!

232
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,416
Hey..congrats You got the
highest in written test.

233
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,583
-Thank you, sir.
-Oh, Armoor? Even I’m from Armoor.

234
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,708
Only 48% in engineering! Why?

235
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,333
Not like that sir…

236
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,125
1st year lecturers didn't come.

237
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,708
-2nd year Chicken Gunya, sir.
-What?

238
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,041
-Little louder please.
-Chicken Gunya, sir.

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,666
3rd year I tried to make up, sir... but...

240
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,833
It's ok.

241
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,250
Can you solve this simple
java program for me?

242
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,333
Sir?

243
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,500
Yeah, you scored THE
highest in the written test.

244
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,041
Just do it.

245
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,875
You already wrote this, right?

246
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,666
-Sir.
- It’s the same thing.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,791
How did you score the highest? I don't
know why you are taking so much of time.

248
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,166
Don’t take any tension, ok?

249
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,166
Let it go. We’ll try another job. Bye.

250
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,750
Anitha... Where's Mouni?

251
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,625
-Stop!
-How you can ask me to stop so suddenly?

252
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,875
She didn't answer my call.
Call her and ask her where she is.

253
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,625
-Here.
-Madam, change.

254
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,291
I'm here at your room.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,833
Hey, your uncle is here.
He’s waiting for you at the house.

256
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,041
I saw him.

257
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,208
He’s waiting at the gate.
He’s here to take me away.

258
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,166
Please say something
and send him away.

259
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,583
Tell him that the interview is done
and I need to attend the second round.

260
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,125
Say something and send him away.

261
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,791
Ok ok, I will.
The job is confirmed, right?

262
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,625
Confirm?

263
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,541
I’ll never get a job.

264
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,750
I fainted during the interview process.

265
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,458
It’s ok. Calm down now.

266
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,208
Don't get tensed. Did you eat anything?

267
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,750
Eat something. I'll manage your uncle.

268
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,583
Brother brother… Client…

269
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,291
You got the same paper right?
What happened at the interview?

270
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,250
They are really heartless.

271
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,750
Who asks technical
questions in an interview?

272
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,208
God, you have no brains at all.

273
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,333
How can you answer all
the questions correctly?

274
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,958
You have to give some wrong answers.

275
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,291
Right? My bad luck.

276
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,166
I got full marks for the first time in my
life, but still eneded up without a job.

277
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,166
They will doubt it if someone
gets full marks, right?

278
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,375
You have to be little sharp.

279
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,416
You can't bag a job being this dull!

280
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,708
How will this work? You tell me.
Mouni, you there?

281
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
Ok I'll call you back. Please send
away that Anaconda first. Please!

282
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,958
Yeah yeah ok.

283
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,333
Come, it’s ok. Please sit.

284
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,208
We have morning evening
batches...5:30, 6:30, 4:30, 5:30.

285
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,750
1500 for two. 1800 for one.

286
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,250
It’s good to have a juice daily at the
jucie center and that’ll cost you 500.

287
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,250
But that is not compulsory. Ok?

288
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,541
I can’t give you 1+1 offer.
You came alone and missed the offer.

289
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,291
Brother, the pamphlets…

290
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,333
What time will you come at?

291
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,416
What batch? Morning or evening?

292
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,416
What’s Zumba?

293
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,750
Zumba?

294
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:59,500
Zumba means energy… Fat, weight, stress,
strain, thyroid… Any solution one problem.

295
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,500
I mean, any problem one solution.

296
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,375
[both]: Revanth Zumba centre.

297
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:07,666
Hello!

298
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,208
Hey, he says he’ll wait.
You uncle is not leaving.

299
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,791
I’ve got some urgent work. Will tell
you the timings later. Thank you!

300
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,083
Here, keep this. This is the number.

301
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,208
Brother, button up properly.

302
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,375
[chatter]

303
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:52,166
Peanuts... Fresh peanuts.

304
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,375
Helloooo… Five hundred.

305
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,625
I don’t have the change, brother.

306
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,458
1000?

307
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,958
Hey… getlost. You bloody… Move!

308
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,916
Leave me!

309
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,208
-Is this land your dad’s or is she your girl?
-Bloody!

310
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,166
If a boy sits alone in a park...

311
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:46,083
you’ll think that he lost his job, or ran out
of money, or that his girlfriend had left him…

312
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,333
But if a girl sits alone, ‘Will you come
with me’, ‘How much will you charge’,

313
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,416
‘Will you sleep with me’,
what’s with all this?

314
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,625
Of course you are right, brother.
But the girl looks hot.

315
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,375
Bloody… Get lost from here. Move!

316
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,166
-Hello.
-Who’s he? Do you know him?

317
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,041
Eee, let it go. Just some random fool.

318
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,333
You didn’t get the job?

319
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,416
How do you know?

320
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,250
It’s written all over your sad face.

321
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,625
Don’t take tension.
It will work out next time.

322
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,708
Shall I tell you something…

323
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,750
Join Zumba… I bet you’ll
bag a job within one month.

324
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,375
Timing full flexible…

325
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,416
Let’s say you have the 1+1 offer too.
It feels good.

326
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,208
-What’s the problem?
-Money problem.

327
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,166
I don’t even have money
for my mobile recharge.

328
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
You have no money?

329
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,541
Madam madam Revanth
fitness centre madam.

330
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,791
-Fat, weight, stress...
-Do you think I look fat? No!

331
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,083
Madam madam we will provide
you with the 1+1 offer.

332
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,125
Do this… Distribute these pamphlets.

333
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,875
No one is taking from us.
I’ll pay 5 rupees per pamphlet.

334
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:18,083
If a girl hands it, it will work.

335
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,708
- What say? Here.
-Hey!

336
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,375
Are you freaking kidding me?
Do you know my qualification?

337
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,041
B.Tech. I have 20 acres back at my home.

338
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,875
You want me to distribute pamphlets?
What do you think of me?

339
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,416
God, look at you talk about prestige.

340
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,083
Didn’t you make a scene for just 5 rupees?
You just told me that you are out of money.

341
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,375
B.Tech! 20 acres…!

342
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,250
See I don’t need this.

343
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,333
You know who he is? He’s a broker.
I came here to make him leave you alone.

344
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,416
Or else, why would I be here at all?
Try to understand.

345
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:57,166
Madam madam any problem one solution
Fat, weight, stress, strain, thyroid...

346
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,541
-We are ok.
-We are fine, leave.

347
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,625
Madam, we have 1 + 1
offer… Give it a try madam…

348
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,791
Hello, mom…

349
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,458
How many times should I tell you
mom… Not to let him come here.

350
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,625
He’s your uncle,
you need to have respect for him.

351
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,291
Grandma asked him to go. What can I do?

352
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,916
Where is a girl staying in
such a huge city? Who’s she's with?

353
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,000
We have to know, right?
Give me that phone.

354
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,166
You can’t do those jobs
and all… Just come home.

355
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,750
Give the phone back to
mom… Give her the phone…

356
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,625
Here. She only wants to
talk with you it seems.

357
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,125
Actually, he’s there in the city
looking for a match for Reshma.

358
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,916
He said he’ll visit you and give
you some money. How can I stop him?

359
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,250
He took over our 20 acres and now he’s
throwing little money at us every month.

360
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,333
And he acts as if he’s taking care
of the entire village. Shameless!

361
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,041
We wouldn’t have been facing these
problems if dad was of any good.

362
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,791
What is he doing? Is he drinking?

363
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,125
Give...

364
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,375
I have sent you a photo over WhatsApp.
Take a look.

365
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:55,583
Ramya study well. Don’t waste time.
The job market is very tough here.

366
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,583
Arey, you only talk to her mom!

367
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,416
Shall I ask him to send
some to your account?

368
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,916
You went off without
any money at all.

369
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,250
You have to ask that Anaconda, right?
No need.

370
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,708
I’ll send some money.

371
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,875
No need, mom.

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,583
Ok, take care.

373
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,583
Mouni...

374
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,125
Mouni where are you? Mouni…

375
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,291
Why are you sitting here?
What happened?

376
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,875
I thought I’ll get this job for sure.

377
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,750
Let it go. Lite!

378
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,250
Now I don’t have any hope.

379
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:37,333
Hey, our ‘Lizard’ fellow is working for
Google. He’s in a nice position there.

380
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,416
Why don’t you call him once?

381
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,750
The Lizard?
He’ll irritate with his extras.

382
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,666
Hey, nothing will happen.
What’s wrong with it?

383
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:48,458
Remember, he was mad about you while in
college. He might set you up with a job.

384
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,875
I’m hungry. Come on, let’s eat.

385
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,708
Is your Zumba sir a good guy?

386
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,500
Why do you ask?

387
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,250
I shouted at him in the evening.

388
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,958
is it? I don’t believe you.

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,625
Hey, true.
Don’t know what he might have felt.

390
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,708
He won’t feel bad. Let’s go.

391
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,750
Left right…

392
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,083
Left right… Againagain once more…

393
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,625
-Anupama madam, you have to work hard…
-Anitha… keys...

394
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,125
Sir, I was able to lose
weight through your exercises…

395
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,625
But my backside still needs to reduce.

396
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,041
Hey Dheeru... Go make her work out.

397
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,166
Ok, ma’am… Let’s change your
workout next week and try.

398
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,083
-Yeah, ok. Do this for now.
-Ok, sir.

399
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,125
Keep going. Yes… Yes…

400
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,166
Hey, I asked you to leave, right? Go.

401
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:19,708
Go!

402
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,750
I’ll distribute pamphlets…

403
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,833
In the park.
You asked me yesterday, remember?

404
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,458
No need. That work is done.

405
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,916
No need?

406
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,750
There are some more left, right?

407
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,666
Yeah, there are… But you can’t do it.

408
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,833
You can't do it. You can't do it.
You can't do it.

409
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,291
-I can do it.
-Is it?

410
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:54,041
You are an engineer. With 20 acres
of land… You can’t. Let it go.

411
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,208
Hey brother… What is this, brother!

412
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,916
Hello, one minute.

413
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,750
Here… There are 100 in this bunch…

414
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,916
You said you’ll distribute, right?

415
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,000
No… You are heartless.

416
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,708
You keep arguing… And
throw attitude… No need.

417
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:30,125
You did a mistake. I did a mistake.
We are equal now.

418
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,375
Hey, Dheeru is looking at us,
and this won’t look good. Here...

419
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,375
Who’s he?

420
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,041
My villain…

421
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:44,625
Hey, what’s with the money?
I didn’t ask you for money.

422
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,333
I just wanted to help you.
You helped me in the park, right?

423
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,250
You have to work if you are out of money.

424
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,625
If you work, you have to take money.
That’s the rule.

425
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,625
I didn’t work yet, right?

426
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,333
You will… Some money might come handy…

427
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,750
No no, let it go.

428
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,041
Hey, I will feel bad.

429
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,208
Why will I care if you feel bad?

430
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,791
I helped you in the park, right?

431
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,708
So what should I do now?

432
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:15,041
You have to distribute these pamphlets,
earn money on it, and be happy.

433
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,750
-Revanth.
-Sir?

434
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,666
You didn’t pay rent from last 2 months.

435
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,958
But now you’re paying
5 rupees per pamphlet?

436
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,791
Sir, I will pay, sir.
I will… Next month, for sure. For sure.

437
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,875
What is he saying?

438
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,583
That girl has some problems it seems.

439
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,375
-Please cook chicken today.
-No.

440
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,000
It’s been so long.

441
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,916
Last time the smell was so great.
We didn’t pay the rent, right?

442
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:49,083
Let’s cook with the fan turned on.
He can’t even smell it.

443
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,500
Hey, stop!

444
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,291
Ok, you go get the chicken.
I’ll wait here.

445
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:55,625
Yeah, ok, brother.

446
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:09,083
Peanuts… Peanuts…

447
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,291
Peanuts… Peanuts…

448
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,500
-These are mine.
-How can that be?

449
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,500
Hey look… Look at my photo.

450
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,208
-Don’t blame me. Go ask that girl.
-Get lost!

451
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,416
She gave me these.

452
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,833
Who told you?

453
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,625
Brother, I have seen it on YouTube…

454
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:32,541
Rotate like this 50 times a day and
your back will reduce… Listen to me…

455
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,208
Won't work.

456
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,375
-It will.
-How will it reduce?

457
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,666
-Belly will reduce, not the back.
-It will work… Rotate fast.

458
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,583
This has to reduce… Not like that…

459
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,916
What? Are you cooking chicken?

460
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,291
Brother, she is here.

461
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,791
Don’t look that side.

462
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,875
-You go check on the chicken.
-She is laughing at us!

463
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,291
Chicken curry?

464
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,750
Did you distribute the pamphlets?

465
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,250
Yeah I did.

466
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,375
To the peanut vendor?

467
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,208
How did you find out?

468
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,166
Waste of pamphlets… Waste of
money… Waste of everything…

469
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,916
I already told you that you can’t do it!

470
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,750
I tried, but it failed to.
I’ll return your money.

471
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,916
What will you pay? 100 pamphlets… Oil
paper… You took them voluntarily, right?

472
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,208
I saw people from my village.
I felt shy!

473
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,375
Shy?

474
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,875
Didn’t you feel shy to sit idle at home? And you
feel embarrassed while distributing pamphlets.

475
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:29,125
Is it work only if you have ACs and computers?
Are we all jokers to you or what?

476
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,333
What did you say?

477
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,125
I’m not jobless… I
did my engineering…

478
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,791
Engineering?

479
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,333
Then where is your job?

480
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,041
You failed to get one even with the question
paper handed to you. That’s jobless…

481
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,791
Watch your mouth… You are jobless…

482
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,750
I’m jobless? Hey, why do I even care?

483
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,416
I came from zero.
I started a center on my own.

484
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,916
I make 50 thousand per month.
Did you even earn a single penny?

485
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,791
You are just hopping around and
making money… What’s there in it?

486
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,875
Hopping? This is dance. Zumba.

487
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,208
What do you even know uh?

488
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,416
With this behaviour, you’ll never
get a job. I’m sure about it.

489
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:07,333
Also, you can’t do it… You can’t
do it… You can never do it. Leave!

490
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,708
So…I was saying…

491
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:23,083
What’s with the English, you Lizard.
Why are you irritating me?

492
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,791
Tell me if you have a job.
Or else, just sit silent.

493
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,250
It’s really tough here. You can’t do it.

494
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:39,083
Mouni… Mouni listening…. Mouni. Mouni.

495
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,041
Mouni...
Mouni, ok ok there is a job.

496
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,083
Data entry work at my friend’s startup.

497
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,625
But he can’t pay much salary.

498
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,250
Not more than 5 thousand.

499
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,458
A maid will get paid better.

500
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,500
Mouni… Mouni...

501
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:03,250
I heard you are falling unconscious in
the interviews, how do I refer you then?

502
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,416
I get dizzy with tension.
And you are joking about it? Damn you.

503
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:14,250
Hey… What will you get from scolding me?
I’m telling you the facts.

504
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,125
You have to know something.

505
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,875
You have to have some talent here. Mouni…

506
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,041
I told you that you can't do
it, right?

507
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:35,166
Is it work only if you have ACs and computers?
Are we all jokers to you or what?

508
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:38,000
You can't do it... You can't do it...
You can't do it...

509
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,583
Some crazy dreams!

510
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,375
All these layers of love!

511
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,791
My heart crossed all of them…

512
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,541
And it flew!

513
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,333
I won myself...

514
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:14,083
These are the moments I do…

515
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,416
All these words…

516
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,875
They don’t stop flowing.

517
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:27,958
There is a crazy tune in my heart!

518
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:33,958
That’s the crazy tune of our tale!

519
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,416
I feel like I have new wings.

520
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:40,708
I just roamed all the skies.

521
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,250
I feel like I can breathe better.

522
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,541
It made me take a dip in excitement.

523
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,791
I finally got my freedom.

524
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:54,166
And my heart started to sing like a nightingale.

525
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:57,458
Droplets shinned over the flower petals.

526
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,541
And tears of joy smiled back at me.

527
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,666
– I never thought of this.

528
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,208
My heart just quivered.

529
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:17,250
It was just falling…

530
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,375
Into a calm dizziness.

531
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,333
Oh, God!

532
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,875
How did this even happen.

533
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,500
My joy turned into a raindrop…

534
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,666
And it jumped onto me.

535
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:40,166
There is a crazy tune in my heart!

536
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:46,625
That’s the crazy tune of our tale!

537
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,375
I have been writing
love letters in my dreams.

538
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,416
I have never seen this.

539
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:57,000
all this magic inside my heart!

540
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,125
I have never met this.

541
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,625
Just a second with you…

542
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,875
I’ll save each one of
them like it’s a boon.

543
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,000
Seasons change while I’m with you…

544
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:13,958
Let me save all those memories safely.

545
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:41,000
Don’t know which direction.

546
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,541
No idea!

547
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,541
But let’s go for a ride…

548
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,833
Let’s go!

549
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,125
The balloon of my silence popped…

550
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:56,291
And I was even singing.

551
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:59,958
Like the rainbow wore an anklet…

552
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,916
It started dancing…

553
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:06,416
throw the umbrellas to the wind.

554
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,833
not cover up our freedom.

555
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:13,083
Our steps has to cross the borders.

556
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,541
Even the thunderbolts
have to fear our energy.

557
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:19,750
What’s all these silly secrets…

558
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,958
That we both share!

559
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,333
What’s all these silly dances…

560
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,583
They have grown a thousand folds.

561
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,916
What’s with collecting all the hopes…

562
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:36,041
This has never happened.

563
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:39,666
What’s with my concentration
taking a side track…

564
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:42,875
This feels strange!

565
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,833
What a dance!
Such a great dance you did!

566
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,416
Like a peacock in the rain.

567
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:23,333
Hey hey, forget about these jobs.
Come join me.

568
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,708
I can’t do it, right? Now can I?

569
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,166
Sorry… Sorry, it’s a mistake I said so.

570
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,583
You have some magic with you.

571
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,916
If we can come together,
the Zumba center will be magical too.

572
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,291
Girls will form queues to join us.
And boys will follow.

573
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,250
Trust me, ah.

574
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,458
I even know an idea to reduce this.

575
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey hey, how? Tell me… Tell me…

576
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,583
I won’t. I don’t need this.
I got a job.

577
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,666
-Eh eh listen to me.
-Forget it.

578
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,250
Mouni... Mouni...

579
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,458
Looks like you got a job at the station.

580
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,916
You saw me? What?
Are you following me?

581
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,625
Forget about me following you. If the police
observe you, they will start following you.

582
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,083
If you have no work to do,
why don’t you stay home?

583
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,625
I’m going mad sitting idle at home.

584
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,625
Then join me.

585
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:42,333
It’s better than here. Your stress will
go off. You can earn and also be fit.

586
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,041
My parents won’t say ‘Yes’ to this.
Let it go.

587
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,666
Hey, what’s wrong with this?
You are only dancing…

588
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,625
Ok, I’ll give you partnership.

589
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,416
You can tell your parents that
you started your own business. Ah.

590
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,416
The money you make out of a job,
will it be sufficient? Will it feed you?

591
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,958
Business has future!

592
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,625
-Mouni... Mouni...
-Brother!

593
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,458
-Mouni.
-Brother brother… Hear me out once.

594
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,833
Get lost!

595
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:09,625
How will you even do a software job? You’ll
have to wear glasses. Your back will hurt.

596
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,208
You’ll lose hair too. Think about it.

597
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:18,291
Brother, you too think about me once.
Please!

598
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,333
What do you want?

599
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:24,916
Brother, you have a feeling that sister
is not understanding you, right? Right?

600
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:29,625
You feel it, right? I have the same feeling.
You are not understanding me, brother.

601
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,083
You touched my heart. Come on.
Make me understand. Come.

602
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,750
Brother, Geetha and I have been
in love for the last 2 years.

603
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,250
There is a curfew going on in her house.

604
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,625
Brother, your center is a safe
place and no one will doubt it.

605
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:43,333
Just one job.
I’ll be very happy if I see Geetha.

606
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,416
Do you think my center is
a hangout spot for lovers?

607
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,750
Ah ah ah… Brother, nothing like
that please, please… Sorry sorry…

608
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:48,666
Just this one help.

609
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,750
Hey, can’t you understand?
The girl is very rich.

610
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,791
Her father paid full
year’s fee in advance.

611
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,708
Do you know who they are?

612
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,875
What is your identity?

613
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,083
Hey, listen to me. We don’t have
properties and we don’t get loans.

614
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,833
No one will rent a house to us.

615
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,291
Don’t waste your time. Study well.

616
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:16,833
Brother brother I study well… I’m
an engineering student. College topper.

617
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,625
I’ll get a job in the next 6 months through
campus placements. Minimum 1 lakh salary.

618
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,625
Do you think they will say ‘yes’ to your
marriage seeing that one lakh salary?

619
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,583
They won’t. It won’t happen.

620
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,583
Why do you want to get into this mess?

621
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,875
Brother, who wants to
deal with all this mess?

622
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,625
I just fell in love, that’s it.

623
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:42,791
When you struggle for a chance to
just see the girl you love everyday…

624
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,500
Then you’ll understand my pain, brother.

625
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,416
Hey, do it. These jobs and
night shifts… You can’t do it.

626
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,750
-But my parents won’t agree, right?
-Keep trying for a job.

627
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,958
Teach Zumba in the morning and evening.
Tell them that you got a job.

628
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,125
What’s complicated in that?

629
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,875
You did great.
Such a great dance… wow wow…

630
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:12,875
He’s correct. Think about it.
I’m telling you, you are happy doing this.

631
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,666
Your sir sent me a friend request.

632
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,833
Accept it. But ask for a huge salary.

633
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:25,166
Nothing less than 20 thousand.
You are an engineer.

634
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,416
20 thousand?

635
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,625
Too much? Want to go back home?

636
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,583
He asked you because he needs you.
So you get to demand now.

637
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,083
Right? Ah… go go go…
Go right now. Go.

638
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,708
Revanth sir... Sir...

639
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,083
Revanth sir... Sir, over here.

640
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,625
I thought about it. I’ll join you.

641
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,875
Hey super… Thank you. Thank you.

642
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,791
Eh, stay there.
I’m coming… I’m coming wait.

643
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,833
-What?
-Come on.

644
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,166
There?

645
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,625
I didn't think you'll say 'Yes'.
Sit, Mouni.

646
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,291
-What are the timings?
-Morning evening.

647
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,583
Salary?

648
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,916
Let’s do a partnership. 50 – 50.

649
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,750
Business will thrive. The partnership
will give you a great advantage too.

650
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:31,041
The partnership is ok… But I
need 20 thousand per month.

651
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,291
20 thousand per month!
And partnership on top of that!

652
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,666
Ok, right?

653
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,875
It won’t work out, Mouni.

654
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,833
Hey eh, sit sit.

655
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:44,791
I did B.Tech, right? Anything less
than 20 thousand won’t look good.

656
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,541
Eh how can that be?
B.Tech is B.Tech and Dance is Dance.

657
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,416
What will Prabhu Deva say if Bill Gates asks
him for a job? He’ll ask him to get lost.

658
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:52,250
And you are a good for nothing engineer.

659
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,291
You have to be realistic, right?

660
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,125
Then will you pay me 15 thousand?

661
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,541
Is that ok?

662
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,916
Let’s see.
I have to arrange the money, right?

663
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:09,083
Ok… Think of it and tell
me your decision. Bye.

664
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,500
Will you tell me tomorrow?

665
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,416
I’m ok upto 10 thousand.

666
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,291
What ok? Such miserly
calculations you have.

667
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,000
As if you are so out of money.

668
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,000
You opened up this huge center.
You are earning 50 thousand per month.

669
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,375
Can’t you pay me just 15 thousand?
Of course, you can.

670
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,875
Hey, what are you doing there, brother?

671
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,416
Hey, what are you doing there, brother?

672
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,333
I jumped in.

673
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,583
-Mom...
-Tell me…

674
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:01,791
I want to ask you something.

675
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,083
-What will you ask early in the morning?
-Listen to me.

676
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,208
A girl came to our center yesterday.
She danced superbly.

677
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,375
I asked her to join me and
she asked for 15 thousand.

678
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,000
Even we are almost
begging here… 15 thousand?

679
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,791
Also, do you need these
dances with the girls?

680
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,583
To teach the students.

681
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:20,125
No need… Ask her to leave.
Where will you bring the money from?

682
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,625
I can’t send you money for
the next 4 months. What will you say?

683
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,666
I’ll pluck your teeth and
place them in your hands.

684
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,375
I’ll develop a lot, mom.

685
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,458
Give me that money and I
will develop you even better.

686
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,333
Will you do Zumba?

687
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:36,416
We go from door to door and get kids…
and then we shout until our throat pains.

688
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,916
Still we are not getting
even 10 thousand.

689
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,083
And you want to pay her 15
just for hopping around.

690
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,875
Shut up!

691
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,625
Mom… What's this?

692
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:49,541
Ok… Last word… Tell
her 10 thousand.

693
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,250
Or else, no need… Ask her to leave.

694
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,875
She’s didn’t agree, right?

695
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,583
But she’s really rich, brother.
It’s true about the 20 acres.

696
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,291
She’s from Armoor.
Anitha told me.

697
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:07,000
-Armoor?
-She’s from your place. But chill!

698
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,083
She came here for a job.

699
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,583
She’s pea-brained.
Even 10 thousand is too much for her.

700
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,541
Who are they?

701
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,916
Her uncle is very affluent.
His name is Narasimham.

702
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,708
They are really rich.

703
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,166
It’s good that we
didn’t commit anything.

704
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,041
I mean to say you didn’t
commit to any money, right?

705
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,208
-Hey my brother is here… Bye!
-Ok ok, bye!

706
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,333
Why is he here all the time?

707
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,291
Ask him to come join. Also, tell him
not to meet up with her on the roads.

708
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,791
He will get thrashed if caught.

709
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:04,250
It’s you who said that we don’t
need all this mess, right?

710
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:07,250
Who wants to be in a mess?

711
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,666
-Love just happens…
-Love?

712
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:12,708
They both are in love.
Let’s help as much as we can.

713
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,041
Love just happens. What can we do?

714
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,416
Is it, brother?
First love happens, then shit happens.

715
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,458
Hey, ask Mouni to meet me.

716
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,458
-Her, why?
-Need to talk to her about the job.

717
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,666
What about the salary?

718
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:33,541
One can't understand you, brother.
Here are the keys.

719
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,375
-I’ll pay you 15 thousand.
-Thank you.

720
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,083
Dad’s name and address…

721
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,791
-Even I’m from Armoor.
-Is it?

722
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,583
My dad work used to work in your fields.

723
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,166
Mom continues to stay at the village.

724
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,000
You got settled well.

725
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,750
Don’t tell anyone…

726
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:16,125
My parents won’t accept me dancing…
I’m telling that I got a software job.

727
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,250
Best… That’s best… Do that.

728
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,791
It won’t be a problem, right?

729
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,791
Don’t make any videos.
Don’t tell anyone from our village.

730
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,875
But publicity needs videos, right?

731
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,000
They won’t accept.
It will be a problem for me.

732
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,583
Ok, as you wish.
I won’t make any videos.

733
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:44,666
Touching me and putting hands on me…
It won't happen while dancing, right?

734
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,333
We have to touch while dancing, right?

735
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:50,250
I don’t like such things.
I need two feet distance.

736
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,500
Yeah, ok.

737
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,500
Thanks…

738
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,291
Hey...

739
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,375
Mouni, what’s that? Careful!

740
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,625
My first salary.

741
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,958
I’ll give my best… My
best… Keep watching…

742
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,958
Winner winner bro.

743
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,875
Chicken dinner bro.

744
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,416
Just dance bro.

745
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,166
It’s a killer!

746
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,208
– Bro bro bro pump up your chest a little.

747
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,375
Bro bro bro your attitude is set bro.

748
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,458
Bro bro bro I swear on my mom.

749
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,791
Bro bro bro your cutout is a hit bro.

750
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,041
We have been from zero of life.

751
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:09,291
We’ll glow like a hero in the future.

752
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:12,416
We can’t follow the flow like sheep.

753
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:14,250
We are so high!

754
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,958
Yeah bro.

755
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,791
Winner winner bro.

756
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,708
Chicken dinner bro.

757
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,250
Just dance bro.

758
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,000
It’s a killer!

759
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,291
If we are stressed.

760
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,958
We’ll lose a life.

761
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,416
Let’s be open and free.

762
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:59,083
Let’s see who’s going to stop us!

763
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,500
Let’s earn decent money.

764
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,166
Let’s burn our problems.

765
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,458
We’ll make a mess.

766
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:05,458
We’ll behave as if this
land belongs to our dad.

767
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,583
We'll rock the world.

768
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,666
We don't care what you say.

769
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,500
We'll rock the world.

770
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,458
Mouni...

771
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,250
Mouni what happened? What happened?

772
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,208
Sorry... Sorry, Mouni.

773
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:33,208
I said 2 feet distance, right?

774
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:36,583
That’s why I said ok to dance.
Even you said ok…

775
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,416
Happened by mistake Mouni…
Sorry, it won’t happen again.

776
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,750
Sorry, Mouni.

777
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,791
We have been from zero of life.

778
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,041
We’ll glow like a hero in the future.

779
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:57,166
We can’t follow the flow like sheep.

780
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,041
We are so high!

781
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,708
Yeah bro.

782
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,333
No matter how much they
talk behind your back.

783
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,166
They will always remain backward.

784
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:34,333
They’ll talk until their throats pain.

785
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:37,500
We have to work even more harder.

786
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,583
No matter what others say… Just
don’t listen to that. Get up!

787
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:44,041
Make a huge sound,
slapping across their face!

788
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,791
Winner winner bro.

789
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,708
Chicken dinner bro.

790
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,416
Just dance bro.

791
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,916
Bro, Mother Lakshmi is here.

792
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It’s a killer!

793
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:00,750
We have been from zero of life.

794
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:04,041
We’ll glow like a hero in the future.

795
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:07,166
We can’t follow the flow like sheep.

796
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,000
We are so high!

797
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,541
Yeah bro.

798
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,458
We have been from zero of life.

799
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,708
We’ll glow like a hero in the future.

800
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,875
We can’t follow the flow like sheep.

801
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,708
We are so high!

802
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,416
Yeah bro.

803
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,083
Call the Lizard. Where the hell is he?

804
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,291
Sunny, click a picture.

805
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,000
-Mouni, hi!
-Hi!

806
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:44,833
-Revanth, that way…
-Hey, Mouni.

807
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,041
-What?
-Keep it.

808
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,291
What’s this? No no..

809
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,291
Keep it. Rates here are really high.

810
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,458
You can pay me back. Keep it.

811
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,541
I have never thrown a
party for my friends.

812
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:04,916
People who get married, who are leaving to
America, who got a job… Everyone threw a party.

813
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,625
First time I’m throwing one.

814
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:12,125
I feel really happy.
All this is just because of you. Thanks!

815
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,125
Eh, nothing like that.

816
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:16,791
Dheeru, come on.

817
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,875
Mouni, come on. Come fast.
Let's go. Guys fifth floor.

818
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,375
-Revanth… My boss.
-Hi!

819
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:24,375
Eh not boss… Partner.

820
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,875
-Hi!
-Sunny... Dheeru.

821
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,708
Yeah, the lift is here.

822
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,875
Cheers! Cheers for our dizzy queen.
For her greatest dancing job…

823
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,708
And For your Boss... Sorry... Partner!

824
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,750
[all]: Cheers!

825
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,083
Hey, let's dance.

826
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,416
Come on... Let's go!

827
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:50,333
-Come on, let's dance.
-You go. keep dancing all day anyways

828
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:52,125
Ok, we are going.

829
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,375
What’s your qualification, brother?

830
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,291
Degree… Did it in open college.

831
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:01,500
Oh!

832
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,125
Are you just business
partners… Or more than that?

833
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,708
What’s Zumba? Something like Cultfit?

834
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,500
Hey not of that level…

835
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:20,208
I just started on the roof of a
small building. Now it grew big.

836
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,750
After Mouni joined,
we have become a group of hundred.

837
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,791
In our area, Revanth Zumba
centre is like a landmark.

838
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,291
How much profit do you make, bro?

839
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,625
Good enough… We are happy…

840
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:39,916
In the next 2, 3 months we are planning
to open a bigger center with 15 lakhs.

841
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,041
Will you do that even without Mouni?

842
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,750
I mean without Mouni… Will you invest
the 15 lakhs you are talking about?

843
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:51,500
Why won’t Mouni be there, brother?

844
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,958
Did Mouni tell her parents?
Do they know about this?

845
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,250
No they don’t…

846
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:00,250
If they do, do you think they will
let her stay here even for a minute?

847
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,958
Do you know who her uncle is?
He’s a bigshot.

848
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,208
They won’t even allow people
like you into their house.

849
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,833
Brother, don’t feel bad.
Don’t take this the wrong way.

850
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,208
You say there’s lakhs of investment
involved. You are betting your life.

851
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,875
I’m telling you this just for
a reality check, that’s it.

852
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:22,625
Let her be friendly with you… If you have
any ideas about love, just forget those.

853
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:25,375
Dinners and dances are
ok in the city, but...

854
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,375
She won’t even look
at you back at home.

855
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:31,166
She won’t even touch you. She’ll
maintain a minimum distance of 2 feet.

856
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,833
Let’s say she got another job…

857
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:36,333
She’ll just fly away. I guarantee.

858
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,916
Also why do you need this
business, brother?

859
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:44,500
Why don’t you bag a government job?
You get them for free, right?

860
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,333
Up... Left... Right...

861
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:59,000
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

862
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,416
How many times should I tell you madam?

863
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:03,666
Not like that, this way… Common do it.

864
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,750
Brother...
The broker for our new center.

865
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,875
Break!

866
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,458
-We'll start after Mouni is here.
-One minute, brother.

867
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:25,625
What? Trying to act smart?
Why do you need Mouni? You do it…

868
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:29,375
-Do it… Will she stay forever or what?
-Come on, do it.

869
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,625
Hi!

870
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:42,291
Why do you look serious?
Because I was late?

871
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:47,666
I danced like hell last night, right?
Got tired. Was so sleepy. Sorry.

872
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:50,916
I’m paying advance for the new
Zumba centre. I’m tensed about that.

873
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:52,291
Did the place get confirmed?

874
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,166
Yeah, beside Gandhi statue.

875
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,416
I have to see, right?

876
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,666
Why are you not smiling?

877
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,541
Nothing like that.

878
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,166
I’m going home this evening.
Got some urgent work to do.

879
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,875
We have a festival in two days, right?
Even I’ll come home.

880
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,666
Good. Go!

881
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,666
Hey, Gangavva…

882
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,958
Hey, fair skin boy… all good?

883
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,708
This is how I am.
How are you doing, Snow White?

884
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,250
Hey, you went to the city
and have become so sharp!

885
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,333
Where is my mom?

886
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,625
Your mom is at school teaching
all the kids to become Collectors.

887
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,500
Ok… Ok… Take this, I’ll be back.

888
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,375
Hey hey, at least have some water.

889
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:00,583
Mom… Mom… Ok, come on now.

890
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,708
-Hey, when did you come?
-Yeah, just now. Come on.

891
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,583
My stock will be here soon.
I’ll come after that, you go home.

892
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,666
The maid will take it.
You come with me. Come come.

893
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:07,958
-My bag!
-Come on...

894
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,791
-Move move move.
-What’s with you?

895
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,875
What? Why are you so silent?

896
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,708
-Mom...
-Haa.

897
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,958
Let’s sell our half acre.

898
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,041
What?

899
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:23,875
-Mom what happened? Mom get on the bike.
-Get lost! I’m not coming with you.

900
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:25,708
Mom where are you going?

901
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,541
-You… You want to sell off my land?
-Mom, it hurts!

902
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,083
-Stop! Stop... Mom!
-Speak out!

903
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,083
-Please get on the bike.
-I won’t get on your bike, get lost.

904
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:36,333
-Mom, where are you going? Get on...
-Hey, get lost!

905
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:38,916
You never listen to me! Mom...

906
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,791
Mom mom… Stop!

907
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:52,875
Dude, how are you?

908
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,750
Hai dude… I’ll meet you later.
Will see you in the evening. Bye.

909
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,708
I made chicken for you.

910
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,916
He don't deserve that.
He says he wants to sell the land!

911
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,375
Did you say that you
want to sell the land?

912
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:06,958
I won’t give you any
chicken, get lost.

913
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,541
How can you sell the land she
bought with a lot of hard work?

914
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:11,166
-What’s up, aunt? How are you doing?
-You haven’t been around all these days…

915
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,375
Now Revanth is here
and you came running.

916
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,833
Eh government works, sister.
What can I do, tell me?

917
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,416
Brother, come on. Sit.

918
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,000
I informed about our land in
the administration office.

919
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:25,541
Yesterday Narsimham’s man called
me… He said he’ll talk to him.

920
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:27,666
He might buy.
He’s buying a lot of lands these days.

921
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,000
What? You put it up in the market already?

922
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,958
-To that Narasimham? Damn you…
-Sister...

923
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:33,750
Mom!

924
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,208
I won’t give it. I won’t agree to this.
Get up. Get out of here.

925
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,416
Sister sister, don’t get angry.
Listen to me.

926
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,541
Sister!

927
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,166
Mom, sister is here.

928
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,916
It’s been so long since I saw you…

929
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,166
Mom...

930
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:54,000
-How are you?
-I’m good.

931
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,541
What’s with these clothes
and the hairstyle?

932
01:00:56,625 --> 01:01:00,083
Hey, keep quiet. Everything looks good.
Sister, what did you bring for me?

933
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:02,458
-I’ll show you.
-I’ll make dosas. Go bathe and come.

934
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,791
Haa… Leave me.

935
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,333
First change out of those clothes.

936
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,875
Mom… Mom… Sister brought
jeans for me. See…

937
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,333
-What's this?
-Looks nice!

938
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,250
How much is it? Is this nice quality?

939
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,333
This is for you. Did you like it?

940
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,875
-It’s nice. Hold this.
-Keep it there.

941
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,750
You sit. Eat a dosa.

942
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:28,291
Didn’t you make groundnut chutney?

943
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,458
Hey, Mouni when did you come?

944
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,041
You didn’t even call! Is everyone
doing good back there? How’s Anitha?

945
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,125
She’s good.

946
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,208
Dad, wait.

947
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,833
What, dear?

948
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,416
My salary. From the past three months.

949
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,291
Very good, dear.

950
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:51,250
Mom, did you see?
My daughter gave me her salary.

951
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,916
Good!

952
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:58,625
Hey Mouni, uncle asked about you.
Go see him once.

953
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:01,500
I will...

954
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:09,666
We can’t do business… We can’t!
This is what they say.

955
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,916
We have to win somehow.

956
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,916
I am very confident. Why will I start
this for nothing?

957
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,666
They are demeaning us.

958
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,875
Hey, who isn’t demeaning us?
Is this new to you…

959
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,958
Just because someone is talking low of
us, should we lose all that we have?

960
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:28,750
If we sell this now, we can never
buy it back. That is our strength.

961
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,833
What will happen? Let it go.
What will happen if it goes?

962
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:36,000
We’ll be zero. We came from zero and we’ll
go back. We can’t go any lower, right?

963
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,583
This time I will do it.

964
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,458
Listen to me… Haa… What say?

965
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,000
Narsimham won’t let it happen.

966
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,625
Let’s see what he says.

967
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,416
Ok, as you wish.

968
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,208
Hey, our land costs 12 lakhs.

969
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,916
-Need in two days.
-It will be done.

970
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,541
Talk carefully, ok?

971
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,958
-Whom do you want?
-I want to meet sir…

972
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:21,416
Sir, Das's son is here to meet you.

973
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:28,250
[both]: Namasthe!

974
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,458
What? Are you Das’s son?

975
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,083
Yes, sir.

976
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,791
What are you doing?

977
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,833
Zumba centre, sir.

978
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:38,541
I teach dance in the city, sir.

979
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:41,833
What? These days are they
paying even to dance around?

980
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:48,500
The street dancer here is running
a Zumba center there it seems.

981
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,041
How much land do you have?

982
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,458
Half acre, sir.

983
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,916
What number are you thinking?

984
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,583
Say ten...

985
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,250
Ten, sir.

986
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,666
Ten is impossible.
Five we can think about…

987
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:08,125
Ask who the buyer is.

988
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,375
Who’s the buyer, sir?

989
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,333
Who’s the buyer, sir?

990
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,416
Me…

991
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,583
-Hey, stop!
-Bye, sir.

992
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,833
-How dare you to talk back?
-Keep calm! Don't make a scene.

993
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,833
You’ll get 5 crores selling 10 acres.

994
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,791
We can bargain ten lakhs in that deal.

995
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,041
But you are selling just half acre.

996
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:35,708
Who will go against me and
buy your land in this village?

997
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,291
Don’t you think we will
maintain the same stand…

998
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,750
I’m giving you this offer just because
your dad worked for us... Got it?

999
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:48,291
Hey, You just dance around… How
can you even understand all this?

1000
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,583
Go learn some dance.

1001
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,541
Let's go!

1002
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,375
He and his bloody life!

1003
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,541
Go on. You play properly first.

1004
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,375
-Go on.
-Play this...

1005
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:37,083
Here... Play. Hey, that’s an out.
Take away the bat.

1006
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,416
Hand the bat.

1007
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:40,708
-Stop cheating.
-Ok bowl again.

1008
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,458
-Ok, go on.
-Go on.

1009
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,750
-What are you looking at?
-Someone is here…

1010
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,916
Is teacher here?

1011
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,375
-Mom.
-Who's that?

1012
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,666
Someone is here for you.

1013
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,000
What?

1014
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:00,791
Who’s are you?

1015
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,208
Venkatesham’s daughter.

1016
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,416
Come inside.

1017
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:11,041
Hey, Why is Venkatesham’s
daughter here?

1018
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,458
How can I know?

1019
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:17,250
Sit sit… Sit... What brings you here?

1020
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,458
Do you know my sister, aunty? Ramya.

1021
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,750
She’s very weak. She's eating rice.

1022
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,791
I’m here to pick up some iron tablets.

1023
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,916
Oh!

1024
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,708
The school is closed.
That’s why I’m here.

1025
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,000
Here... These four days are
holidays, right?

1026
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,125
Hey Revanth…

1027
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,458
Yeah, mom…

1028
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,916
Revanth, come here.

1029
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:39,708
My son… He’s running a
Zumba center… In Hyderabad…

1030
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,208
Revanth Zumba centre,
has become a landmark.

1031
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,000
Hey, sit.

1032
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,125
I'll go see if I had stock.

1033
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:49,125
Sit.

1034
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:52,208
Why did you come to my uncle’s house?

1035
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,666
Why did you come here? Do you
know how dangerous it is?

1036
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:56,291
Why are you not answering my calls?

1037
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,625
What happened?

1038
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,791
-Do you want some sweets?
-Sweet?

1039
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:03,541
Aa, mom… Bring her a sweet…

1040
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,375
Revanth…

1041
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,666
Narsimham is not giving
you the right rate, is it?

1042
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,125
Bloody idiot! May he die of a dirty
disease. Bloody fool… How can he do this?

1043
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,375
-Mom is inside, go!
-How will you get the money now?

1044
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,750
I beg you… Shut up and go inside.
I’ll talk to you later.

1045
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,625
Who’s this girl?

1046
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,041
Shh… Slowly…

1047
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,250
Who’s this girl?

1048
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,291
You granny.. Move… Move!

1049
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,666
I don’t understand you… Who’s
that girl and what’s happening?

1050
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:34,916
My grandma!

1051
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,416
Are you selling the land?

1052
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:41,083
It’s ok, I’ll adjust the money.
No problem.

1053
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:45,458
Who’s that girl?

1054
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,125
Keep calm… I’ll tell you. Move…

1055
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,666
Here.

1056
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:54,583
-Wait.
-I’ll take leave.

1057
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,041
Take this.

1058
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,666
-It's ok.
-Take it… my mom makes great sweets.

1059
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,125
Have some. Eat it.

1060
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,000
-Bowl properly.
-Bye!

1061
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,125
-Bye. Take care child.
-Take his wicket!

1062
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Hey, 15 runs for 10 balls.

1063
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:21,041
She looks nice. Marry her.
I’ll give her my earrings.

1064
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,625
Do you kow who she is?

1065
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:24,708
Venkatesham’s daughter.

1066
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,500
Such bad luck… That
she was born to him!

1067
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,666
-You leave.
-Move!

1068
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:41,166
-When did the load come?
-Sir!

1069
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:44,083
-Unload it fast.
-We have some more lands for sale.

1070
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,875
If it's ok for you,
we'll plan the registration.

1071
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,375
You have to decide the rate and all.

1072
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,250
You know, right? The land will
have value only if it rains.

1073
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,458
What Mouni, how are you?

1074
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,291
Aunty...

1075
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,250
-Hi, Reshma.
-Hi, sister. When did you come?

1076
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,500
-Yesterday.
-Come sit.

1077
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,083
Mouni, doing good?

1078
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,916
-Yeah.
-Is the job good?

1079
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,208
Do you want to have some tea?

1080
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,625
-Yeah.
-Ok, wait.

1081
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,083
-What did you bring for me?
-This is for you.

1082
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,791
-[all]: Bye, brother.
-Ok, let's meet again.

1083
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,125
You didn’t get anything for me?

1084
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,958
How your job? What’s the pay?

1085
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,333
10 thousand...

1086
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:38,041
But... if I get trained with new
software, they’ll pay me 25 thousand.

1087
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:39,666
What software, sister?

1088
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,250
Cloud computing …

1089
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,583
Oh... ok ok.

1090
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,250
It will cost 1 lakh for the training.

1091
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,833
1 lakh for training?

1092
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,125
It’s a certification…

1093
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:54,666
Yeah, dad. She’s right.
The future will be great.

1094
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:01,541
This time we got a nice profit
over the harvest, right?

1095
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:05,333
I want 1 lakh from our share.

1096
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,583
I want 1 lakh from our share.

1097
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,500
-I'm in need.
-Ok, you don't get tensed.

1098
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,333
-Come inside... Let’s talk.
-You be happy.

1099
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:30,625
Go, sister. Ask him.

1100
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,125
Nothing to worry about, go.
He’ll give you the money, go.

1101
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,708
Come!

1102
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,125
What share are you talking about?

1103
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:50,958
Your share?

1104
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,583
Do you know how much
loan your father took?

1105
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,833
Do you?

1106
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:02,625
Come, sit.
I’ll show you some math. Sit.

1107
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:14,625
-What happened?
-Mouni, what happened?

1108
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,958
Did you feel dizzy again?

1109
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:18,208
Go get some water.

1110
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,041
Nothing will happen… It will get better.

1111
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,375
Have some water.

1112
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:27,125
The kind of money we have spent on
the doctors… But she never got well.

1113
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,250
Mouni...

1114
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,500
What happened? Mouniii…

1115
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,500
Open the door.

1116
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,416
Mouni, listen to me. Open the door.

1117
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,791
Mouni...

1118
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,041
What’s with the anger?
Where are you going?

1119
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:12,833
I need to go and I’m going.

1120
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,458
The festival is in two days. Mouni…

1121
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,541
How can you not stay for the festival?
Stay for two more days.

1122
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,541
Didn’t your uncle give any money?

1123
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:23,416
Great sons you gave birth to!

1124
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:25,666
How dare you talk like that?

1125
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:28,708
Whatever he does,
he does it for your well-being. Shut up!

1126
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:31,208
Only he has to get you married one day.

1127
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:33,375
Your dad can’t do anything.

1128
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,166
He won’t get me married,
he’ll get me killed.

1129
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,791
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1130
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,208
What? You are leaving already?

1131
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:40,833
Study well. Take care.

1132
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,333
Mom… Don’t touch the
money he sends you.

1133
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,041
I’ll send you money every month.

1134
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:52,125
-Keep this.
-Mouni...

1135
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,625
Bye!

1136
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:58,291
-Bye!
-Ok, bye!

1137
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,416
Bus will stop for just one hour here.
Make it fast.

1138
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:11,666
What are you doing here?

1139
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,583
-Are you following me?
-Or what?

1140
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:18,833
You called and said that you were leaving.
I would be worried, right?

1141
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,041
I’m returning.

1142
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,250
You are not staying for the festival?

1143
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,083
I had a fight… And came out.

1144
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,208
-What happened, Mouni?
-Nothing!

1145
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,458
Hey, what happened?

1146
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:41,500
I asked for some money… For our
Zumba centre. Couldn’t adjust.

1147
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:45,375
You fought at home for me?

1148
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,250
They are not letting you
sell your land, right?

1149
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,791
I thought he will give me some money.
But didn’t work.

1150
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:05,833
Here... Jewlery…

1151
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:09,166
What’s this?

1152
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:14,500
These are mine.
My dad got them made for my marriage.

1153
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,583
Hey, Mouni I don’t want them.

1154
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,250
What? Are you feeling sentimental
that they were made for my marriage?

1155
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,666
Have you gone mad. Mouni?
I don’t want them.

1156
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,458
They are not more important
than our Zumba centre…

1157
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,500
Sell them and we’ll at least
get money for the advance.

1158
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:36,458
Ok, keep them with you.
I’ll ask if I need them.

1159
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,458
Hey, Mouni...

1160
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:48,375
You are very different from your people.
You are different!

1161
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,458
Your uncle is not a good man.

1162
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:55,541
Not a good man?
He’s a blood thirsty devil.

1163
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,958
They call him ‘Bloody bugger’.

1164
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,333
Bloody bugger? He’s
spycho, sadist, moron, creul and vicious.

1165
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,666
Loafer, useless…

1166
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:07,125
He’s a filty dung bettle…

1167
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:11,791
We should slice him into pieces
and feed him to crows and eagles.

1168
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:16,458
I hope we kill him and burry him.
May worms eat him up… May he die…

1169
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:23,125
What happened, Mouni?

1170
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,333
I need to go to the bathroom…
I have to change urgently.

1171
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,875
Where’s your bag?

1172
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,166
In the bus.

1173
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,875
Stay here, I’ll go get it.

1174
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,958
Ok, sir. Ok. Tell me.

1175
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,041
-Brother, need a room urgently.
-Single or double?

1176
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,000
-Single.
-Ok. I need your ID card.

1177
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,375
-Do you have sanitary pads?
-Yeah, we do.

1178
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,750
I took a room. No problem.

1179
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,041
Brother, stop stop stop…

1180
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,666
Brother...

1181
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:44,708
Waste fellow! He didn't stop, Mouni.

1182
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,916
-Shall we go on bike?
-No.

1183
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:50,458
Another bus will come. Let’s wait.

1184
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,750
You have to walk . Is it required at
this time? Why don’t you get on the bke?

1185
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,583
Nothing like that. I fear bikes.

1186
01:16:57,583 --> 01:17:01,750
If I get on and touch you, I feel scared.
I get dizzy.

1187
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,666
I have no problem with you.
The problem is completely mine.

1188
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,166
I’m comfortable with you.

1189
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,166
Or else, will you go?

1190
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,291
Ehyy, let’s wait.

1191
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:35,083
Brother... One passenger. Ladies.

1192
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,250
-Get on.
-Mouni.

1193
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,416
-Mouni, here... I'll follow.
-Ok.

1194
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:13,416
I'll take care of the case.

1195
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:16,041
-Namasthe, Narasimha.
-Namasthe! I'll call you back.

1196
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,375
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1197
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:21,375
I went to Kaamareddy on some work.

1198
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,541
I saw our Mounika there.

1199
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:28,125
Don’t know what she
was doing there alone?

1200
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:30,000
She’s a girl and these
are really bad days…

1201
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,791
I just came to tell you that.

1202
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,083
Are you here to cross the bridge?

1203
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,458
No… Why do you ask?

1204
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:47,625
If lovers cross this bridge together,
their love will be a success.

1205
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:49,666
-Is it?
-You’ll always be together.

1206
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,041
-Let's go.
-Hey, have you gone mad?

1207
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:54,291
-[both]: Bye!
-Did you have to tell him brother?

1208
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,541
-He’ll stay here forever.
-Let him stay.

1209
01:18:56,583 --> 01:19:00,375
Didn’t Quli Qutub Shah stay for Bagmathi?
He swam in a flood for her.

1210
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,541
It’s because of his risk his
father built this bridge.

1211
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,125
Their love is a huge success.

1212
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:10,041
Those who will cross this bridge of love
together, their love will also be a success.

1213
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,375
Why is he believing in all this Mouni?

1214
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,708
Let him. What’s wrong in it?

1215
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:18,750
What about the girl’s
status… And look at him!

1216
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,583
What’s with you?
What generation are you in?

1217
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,541
How may people are going for
inter-caste marriages, right?

1218
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,500
You have to check every
vertical before marriage, right?

1219
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,041
What do you have to check?

1220
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,791
Is he a good guy?
Does he have a job or not?

1221
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,666
Does he like me or not? That’s it.
What else do you have to check?

1222
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,041
-That’s it?
-Hmm!

1223
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,958
What are you all doing?

1224
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:05,291
She has to stay for the festival, right?
Why did she leave?

1225
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:08,958
Nothing. New job, right?
She went off on urgent work.

1226
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:12,750
No… She went off shouting…
She wants properties…

1227
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,541
That’s why she came to meet
you… She went off cursing…

1228
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,583
She’s just young… She knows nothing…
She just said what she said.

1229
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,833
It’s ok if she shouts out few words…
But she shouldn’t disgrace us, right?

1230
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,666
Call her… Inquire
where she is… Call her.

1231
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,791
She didn’t go to the city directly…

1232
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:30,458
Chandrasekhar saw her in a hotel it seems.

1233
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,458
Where are you?

1234
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,875
Where will I be? In my room.

1235
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,833
That’s what... When did you reach there?

1236
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,041
This morning. Why do you ask?

1237
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,375
This morning?

1238
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:42,500
What time did you leave! Where are you last
night? Why are you not answering your phone?

1239
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,541
If I had called Anitha,
you would have made a scene.

1240
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:45,833
At least you have to call me, right?

1241
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,541
What happened now?
Why are you making a scene?

1242
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:50,333
You didn’t arrange any money.
And you are shouting at me now.

1243
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:53,875
Mom, listen.
I got my date while I’m on the bus.

1244
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:57,250
So I had to stop at a hotel.
And I missed my bus.

1245
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,750
What happened now?

1246
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,041
Have you no sense?
You have to be prepared, right?

1247
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,833
The times are not good, right?

1248
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,916
Hey, she’s up to something.

1249
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,500
I’ll see about that.

1250
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,000
I asked our SI to check at the hotel.
I’ll pull everything out.

1251
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:38,083
-Hey.
-Sir?

1252
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,666
-Go get some tea.
-Ok, sir.

1253
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,875
-Does the vehicle have diesel in it?
-No, sir.

1254
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,250
-Go get it filled.
-Ok, sir.

1255
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:53,000
-Open the entry register…
-Here, sir.

1256
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:55,750
Go mind your work.

1257
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,541
Sir… She didn’t book any room, sir.

1258
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,541
I checked the entire CCTV footage.

1259
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:09,000
Maybe she went to the restaurant.

1260
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:11,333
Or else, your friend might
have seen someone else, sir.

1261
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:13,666
Ok, keep this to yourself.

1262
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:14,666
Ok, sir.

1263
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,708
It’s about a girl, right?

1264
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,250
Ok, sir. Bye!

1265
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:24,083
Something is not right.

1266
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:25,583
I'll look into it.

1267
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:29,958
I found a card in her purse.
Maybe she works there.

1268
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,375
Don’t let sister-in-law know about this.

1269
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,833
You went to a hotel with
Venkatesham’s daughter!

1270
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,208
Do you think you will live after that?

1271
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,375
How did you know? Who told you?

1272
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,791
Her uncle asked me to go
to that hotel and enquire.

1273
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,166
The CCTV footage captured our hero.

1274
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,666
I managed and told him that it’s clear.

1275
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,958
How did you even know that girl?

1276
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:54,500
Revanth… This…

1277
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,416
Mouni… Come in.

1278
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,083
He’s my brother. SI in our village.

1279
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,083
I told him everything.
He’s really close to me.

1280
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:11,958
See this.

1281
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:15,958
What’s all this?

1282
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,875
She’s working in my Zumba center, brother.
She stays next door.

1283
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:22,750
His uncle will kill you both
if he sees you like this.

1284
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,875
Fire her.

1285
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,000
They are always good to their own people.

1286
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,166
You’ll get sacrificed for all this.

1287
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:31,833
Listen to me.

1288
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:34,625
I failed to sell the land back at home.

1289
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,708
This is the city… Is this
his dad’s kingdom or what?

1290
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,916
Let’s see what he can do.

1291
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,666
Did your mom know about all this?

1292
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,666
Stay away from her. Listen to me.

1293
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,791
Don’t know what this might lead to!

1294
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,958
What?

1295
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,458
Ask her to be careful too.

1296
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,666
Got it?

1297
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,583
…this is how my life has always
been, right?

1298
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,458
What shall we do now?

1299
01:24:02,416 --> 01:24:03,666
You say.

1300
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,625
But ask me to leave. I’ll kill you.

1301
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:12,791
Will you work for 5 thousand?
The job that the Lizard offered you?

1302
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:14,583
Have you gone mad?

1303
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,208
I won’t quit dance.
Fix! Come what may.

1304
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,000
No need to stop dancing, Mouni…

1305
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,375
That’s why I’m giving you this idea. You
have to show your parents a job, right?

1306
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,458
That’s why morning and evening Zumba.
And the job in between.

1307
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:31,375
I know it will be tough.
But what else can we do?

1308
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:36,541
There will be no greater hell
than to live in fear, Revanth.

1309
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,833
My entire life is like that.
It’s filled with fear.

1310
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,708
Nothing will happen, Mouni.
I’m here for you.

1311
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,583
It’s just a small adjustment.

1312
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,125
After we become really famous
and earn a lot of money…

1313
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,708
Then you can announce to everyone…

1314
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:56,333
Then they will shut their mouths.

1315
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,125
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yeah?

1316
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,833
-Mounika.
-Oh, yeah. Please sit.

1317
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,583
Mouni.

1318
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,083
What are you doing here?

1319
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,916
Tell me this first... How is your work?

1320
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,208
I can’t do it.

1321
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,916
You’ll get used to it, Mouni.
The office is only up to 5, right? Now Zumba…

1322
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:44,041
Papers to my land in the village, sir.
Application form.

1323
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:45,708
So your mom finally agreed!

1324
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,958
She have to, right sir?

1325
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,916
Very good! You’ll definitely get a loan.

1326
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,333
-I'll see to it. All the best.
-Thank you, sir.

1327
01:25:52,416 --> 01:25:53,666
Thank you, sir.

1328
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,958
-Hello!
-Is Mounika there?

1329
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:59,750
Mounika, phone… Your uncle.
Do you want to talk?

1330
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,875
-No, sir.
-She really busy, sir.

1331
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,250
-Tell her that I called.
-Ok, sir.

1332
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:18,958
-It's too late for that.
-Shut up and go to sleep.

1333
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:40,875
Mouni we are partners, right?

1334
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,833
Agreement…

1335
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,916
Congrats! Super!

1336
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,625
-What sign? Is she mad?
-Shut up!

1337
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:03,125
Thanks!

1338
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,958
Congrats!

1339
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:08,416
Hello! Ok ok, brother.

1340
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,208
Mouni, my mom is here.
You go inside, I’ll go get her.

1341
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,375
Oh, it’s ok.

1342
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,166
Dheeru, take care of things here.
We’ll start once I’m back.

1343
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,875
Ok, brother.

1344
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:21,500
Hey, what’s happening?

1345
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,416
What’s happening here?

1346
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:24,750
You stay silent.

1347
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:26,125
-Hey, what?
-Brother.

1348
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:28,291
-Mom. come on.
-Revanth!

1349
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:29,750
Close you eyes.

1350
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:31,416
-What?
-Close your eyes.

1351
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:33,666
-No!
-Listen to me...

1352
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,875
-Shall I open my eyes?
-We are here.

1353
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:38,041
-Shall I?
-Yeah, go on.

1354
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:45,583
Mom, see this.
See… Revanth fitness centre.

1355
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,041
Very good!

1356
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,291
Brother, come here.

1357
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:55,875
Here... Click a picture.

1358
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,708
You decorated it well. Nice!

1359
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:08,791
Mom, cut it.

1360
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:09,916
Shall I?

1361
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:23,958
Sir sir… Switch it on, sir. Play it.

1362
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:34,000
-You did well!
-Nice, right?

1363
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,416
What’s this?

1364
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:46,500
-Yeah, thank you.
-Hey, what's all this?

1365
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:49,333
Do you even understand
what you are doing?

1366
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,166
-Hey!
-I'm coming.

1367
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:59,250
Ehyyy, where are you going?

1368
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:01,416
-I’m going to take a look.
-That’s not ours.

1369
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,500
Is this all our half-acre land has got us?

1370
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,916
This is not Armoor.
This is what we get in Hyderabad.

1371
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:12,416
Mom… Brother got some work to do and
he’s starting now. You go with him.

1372
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:14,208
Why to take a bus?

1373
01:30:14,416 --> 01:30:16,250
-Brother...
-What?

1374
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,750
Brother, she says she’ll come with you.
Take her.

1375
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,000
Come, sister. Let’s go. Hey, come on.

1376
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,958
-Come on guys.
-Take care and eat well.

1377
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,750
-Come on.
-Bye!

1378
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:55,875
Anyone can be anything… Correct sentence.
Looks good.

1379
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,750
What happiness! Your face is glowing.
We can switch off the lights.

1380
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,083
This is ours…

1381
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:12,000
Do you know how I was as a kid?

1382
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,208
A jute bag. Rusty cycle.

1383
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,208
My dad uses to work in the fields.

1384
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:23,416
After dad died,
mom has been everything to me.

1385
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,625
She worked really hard.

1386
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:34,083
You’ll laugh at my face if I
tell you my childhood dream.

1387
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,416
I wanted to take my mom
to a huge supermarket...

1388
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,708
...and tell her to take anything she
wants, without bothering about the rates.

1389
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:50,250
Looking at my mom’s face today…

1390
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:05,833
I never thought I will start
this huge a center this fast…

1391
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,416
This is just because of you, Mouni.

1392
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:15,958
Ey… I feel like I can do
anything with you by my side.

1393
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:20,833
We will be partners… We
will start this center…

1394
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,458
You danced in the rain that
day, remember?

1395
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:26,583
Right then,
I knew all this would happen.

1396
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
Shall we dance?

1397
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,958
-Hello, Mouni! Where are you?
-Mom!

1398
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Are you at your room?

1399
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:12,291
Your uncle came to Hyderabad.
He's coming to see you.

1400
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,666
I heard your dad and grandmother talk.

1401
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,000
Are you there?

1402
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,416
He came to the city for some work.

1403
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,666
Do we need him in our lives?

1404
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:25,083
He said he’ll come to see you on his way.
Meet him once.

1405
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:29,291
What will happen if you do?
Do we need this mess right, now?

1406
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:31,541
Mess? This is my life…

1407
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:34,000
-Why don’t you let me live my life?
-Mouni!

1408
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:39,291
If anyone has to worry about me, it has to
me dad. Who is he to tell me what to do?

1409
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,666
Let him come. I’ll teach him a lesson.

1410
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:42,916
I'm not scared now!

1411
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,791
-Hello, Mouni!
-Where are you?

1412
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,416
We didn’t settle the bills, right?
So going to the tent house.

1413
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:03,541
You come to my room now.

1414
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,083
I have to tell you something.
Come right now.

1415
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:10,666
I’ll be waiting.

1416
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:13,541
Ok, I’m coming. I’m coming.

1417
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,666
-Hey, Raju. What happened?
-Sir sir...

1418
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:29,500
The engine broke down, sir.

1419
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:32,250
You have to check before we start, right?
Go take care of it fast.

1420
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:37,791
How long will it take?

1421
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,250
It'll take time, sir.

1422
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:14,041
So this is where you stay!

1423
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,125
Mouni...

1424
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:21,208
Hey… Mouni…

1425
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,625
Here is the money.

1426
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:26,500
Why did you come back, brother?
Didn't you go to meet Mouni?

1427
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:28,166
Her uncle is here.

1428
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,666
-Then let’s go see a movie. I have tickets.
-Yeah.

1429
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:33,541
-Let's go.
-Ok.

1430
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:41,000
Mouni, what happened?
Why are you so scared?

1431
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:46,208
Mouni, open the door, dear.

1432
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:56,750
Mouni!

1433
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,708
Stop acting smart!

1434
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,041
Hey, Mouni…

1435
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:23,500
How can you even live
without my permission?

1436
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:43,583
Mouni…

1437
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:51,541
Mouni…

1438
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:53,250
Hey!

1439
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:55,583
Mouni…

1440
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,625
Why did you keep the door open?

1441
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:02,041
-There’s no one here?
-Who will be here?

1442
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:12,125
I can’t work these night shifts.
Can you make me some tea?

1443
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:13,333
Yeah.

1444
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:26,500
What happened?

1445
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:28,958
Nothing!

1446
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,541
Here are your new centre’s keys.

1447
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,416
Why do you look so dull?

1448
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,500
I’m not coming back… Can’t make it.

1449
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,916
Did you parents find out?

1450
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,958
I don’t like working with you.

1451
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:08,541
Eh eh, are you kidding me?

1452
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:13,375
You bought a new center… Now you have
nothing to do with me, right? Now leave.

1453
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:16,041
Nothing to do with you?
What are you talking about, Mouni?

1454
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:18,166
I’m talking facts.

1455
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,125
Don’t act innocent.

1456
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:23,333
I called you to dinner last night.
You said you will come.

1457
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,625
But why didn’t you?

1458
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:27,833
You went to see a movie, right?

1459
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:29,041
Mouni, you uncle...

1460
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:32,958
Your students increased and you bought a new
center. Now I’m of no use to you anymore.

1461
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:35,416
That’s why you didn’t care about
me, right?

1462
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:39,125
That Lizard fellow warned me about
this… But I’m too dumb to understand.

1463
01:39:39,166 --> 01:39:42,041
All you people are one and the same.
Trusting you will only cause doom.

1464
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:49,000
We people? What do you mean?

1465
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:04,625
Here is your contract.

1466
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,875
We don’t need you. We don’t need you.
We’ll be better off this way.

1467
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,791
It’s a good thing that I came
to know about you this soon.

1468
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:17,625
Thanks ah… You showed me your true
colours. Your uncle is better than you…

1469
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,416
He’ll talk in public, out loud… Real
clear about ‘We people’ and ‘You people’.

1470
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,916
But the word you just said…

1471
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:31,000
You proved to me what I am to you.

1472
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,500
I don’t need you.

1473
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:39,791
I don’t need you.

1474
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:43,000
Damn!

1475
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:55,291
What happened, brother?

1476
01:40:55,708 --> 01:40:56,750
Nothing…

1477
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:23,166
Anupama ma'am, get ready.

1478
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,666
We have to start the class, right?

1479
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,083
Sandeep, are you ready?

1480
01:41:27,083 --> 01:41:28,666
Today’s class is cancelled.

1481
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,458
Why? What happened, brother?

1482
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:22,791
[busy tone]

1483
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:39,208
Sorry!

1484
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:44,416
Sorry!

1485
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,041
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1486
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:52,500
How many times should I say that?
Let it go now.

1487
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:58,875
I don’t think like that.
I don’t have any caste feelings.

1488
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,250
Someone or the other keeps
saying that all the time…

1489
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:04,875
We too take it and move on.

1490
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:09,375
But I never thought that
you will say that too.

1491
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:14,708
First time in my life…

1492
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:18,333
I have been lesser than zero.

1493
01:43:20,875 --> 01:43:22,958
I was just angry and it came out.

1494
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,500
Do I have to face this
huge a punishment for that?

1495
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:29,958
Will you listen to me once?

1496
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,625
We people don’t need to, madam.

1497
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:35,458
What’s with that ‘We
people’ and ‘You people’?

1498
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:37,833
It’s you who started it.

1499
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:40,625
Ok… I did… It’s a slip of tongue…

1500
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,250
Sorry!

1501
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,666
I’ll tell you what happened.
Will you listen?

1502
01:44:05,166 --> 01:44:08,666
Eat something first.
Even I didn’t eat anything. Haa… Eat.

1503
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,041
No need…

1504
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:15,583
What did you say? Tell me now…

1505
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,375
What’s with ‘We people’ and ‘You people’.
Say ‘We people’.

1506
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:47,000
Mouni...

1507
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,666
Mouni, the thing that happened last night…

1508
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,541
I know it’s a mistake…

1509
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:55,625
I’ll try… I’ll try and understand…
Let’s be like we used to be.

1510
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,125
Don’t take any tension.

1511
01:45:57,166 --> 01:45:59,000
Of course, that’s an accident…

1512
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:03,000
But I don’t know how to say it…

1513
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:07,708
I like you…

1514
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:09,875
I love you…

1515
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:23,958
For me, it’s ‘I love
you’ at the first sight…

1516
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:37,458
Hey girl, let’s get a rush.

1517
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:45,833
Let’s get away together.

1518
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,750
Come to me, jumping off the fence.

1519
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,833
Get to me fast.

1520
01:46:51,916 --> 01:46:55,750
Pick up the rainbow…

1521
01:46:55,750 --> 01:47:04,250
And make it a bridge between us.

1522
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:19,083
Lot of thoughts. Lots of pain.

1523
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:21,583
Even if my life is a mess…

1524
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:25,291
Just like a kite…

1525
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:28,416
My dreams fly.

1526
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:32,875
Hope and Disappointment are
two sides of a coin.

1527
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:35,666
Like day and night.

1528
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:38,833
I have a very little to my name.

1529
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:42,208
But all of it is yours now.

1530
01:47:56,750 --> 01:48:03,583
I don’t feel any filters between us.

1531
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:09,375
You are my life from now on.

1532
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:13,916
I have brought my past,
present, and future together.

1533
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:16,541
And made it like a pillow for you.

1534
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:20,041
Rest your head on it, open your eyes…

1535
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:23,208
And look at my glittering world.

1536
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,416
I see light at every
turn that comes my way.

1537
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:31,875
It’s raining love.

1538
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:35,333
Like a beautiful jasmine plant…

1539
01:48:35,916 --> 01:48:38,458
Let it tie us together.

1540
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:43,166
Playing all day,
without knowing any strain…

1541
01:48:43,208 --> 01:48:45,458
Just like the kids.

1542
01:48:45,791 --> 01:48:48,875
I have a very little to my name.

1543
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:52,791
But all of it is yours now.

1544
01:48:57,083 --> 01:49:02,833
Hey girl, let’s get a rush.

1545
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:10,791
Let’s get away together.

1546
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:30,500
Who cries when kissed!

1547
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:40,875
I have dreams that flow like a river.

1548
01:49:41,458 --> 01:49:46,916
They are finding their path.

1549
01:49:47,916 --> 01:49:51,666
I opened up my heart very carefully…

1550
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:54,333
And handed it to you.

1551
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:58,416
I have slept on your chest and saw…

1552
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:01,916
How beautiful the world is.

1553
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,083
The gift that the clouds send…

1554
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:09,875
It will be seen on the lands.

1555
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:13,208
The shadows that keep changing…

1556
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:16,833
Look at the images that float.

1557
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:20,875
The milky-ways that moved to the city…

1558
01:50:20,916 --> 01:50:23,541
Still hold the village in their hearts.

1559
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:27,041
I have a very little to my name.

1560
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:30,666
But all of it is yours now.

1561
01:50:36,833 --> 01:50:38,666
Brother you eat off.
I have got urgent work.

1562
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:41,500
-Why are you in so much hurry?
-Geetha is going to Singapore, brother.

1563
01:50:41,541 --> 01:50:43,500
It’s like a vacation.
I’ll go send her off.

1564
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,625
-Is she going alone?
-No. With her family.

1565
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:46,583
Then how will you meet her?

1566
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:49,500
Geetha will be waiting for me.
I’ll wave her bye from a distance.

1567
01:50:53,666 --> 01:50:54,750
What?

1568
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:58,625
Geetha is going to Singapore.
He says he wants to go to the airport.

1569
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:00,458
I feel it’s risky.

1570
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:02,666
-Bye.
-Bye, sister.

1571
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:03,833
Bye!

1572
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,500
He have to go.

1573
01:51:08,041 --> 01:51:09,416
Your heart drags you away…

1574
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:30,583
-Hello!
-Calling from Hanumakonda PS. Revanth?

1575
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:33,625
Your friend, Sunny, met with an
accident at Hanumakonda highway.

1576
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:36,250
We are taking him to Hanumakonda
general hospital. Come there.

1577
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:37,416
Who’s this?

1578
01:51:38,583 --> 01:51:40,500
Dad, where’s brother?

1579
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:43,291
-I already told him not to go to the city.
-Why are we here?

1580
01:51:43,416 --> 01:51:46,166
-He said he’ll get me a gift for my birthday.
-No one listened to me.

1581
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:49,708
Yeah, he said he’ll bring you a gift.
He called me and told me the same.

1582
01:51:50,166 --> 01:51:53,041
-Nothing will happen to him.
-What are they doing inside?

1583
01:51:53,291 --> 01:51:55,708
-What happened to my son?
-Nothing!

1584
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,625
Where is he?

1585
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:59,958
-Hey, come here.
-Don't cry!

1586
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:01,458
We are done with the post-mortem.

1587
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:06,625
Go to the station, sign the papers,
and take the body. Go fast.

1588
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:22,625
Haa come on… Sign here.

1589
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,750
Sir, who’s bike is that?

1590
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,708
It’s your Sunny’s right?
He ran into a tree with it.

1591
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,666
That’s not his bike, sir. Someone left it in
front of his room. It’s been a week or so.

1592
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,375
He don’t have a bike at all, sir.

1593
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:42,041
What’s this? RC.
He ran into a tree and was spot dead.

1594
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:44,958
Sir, try to understand.
Why will he get onto that highway, sir?

1595
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,625
Hey, who are you?

1596
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:49,041
-Friend.
-If you have any doubt, file a case.

1597
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,375
Sign here and take the
body if you want to.

1598
01:52:53,708 --> 01:52:58,041
Do you want to write a complaint? You
have to keep travelling back and forth!

1599
01:53:01,166 --> 01:53:04,541
Your daughter?
Seem like she’s your only kid now.

1600
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:06,291
Take care of her at least.

1601
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:08,666
Make sure she won’t fall in love.

1602
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:11,250
What? Or else, this will repeat again.

1603
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:18,916
[screaming and sobbing]

1604
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:25,291
Get up… You said you’ll make
me get on a flight, right?

1605
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:27,541
You said you’ll take me to America…

1606
01:53:28,125 --> 01:53:29,791
Get up!

1607
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:34,250
I don’t want to go to
America, let’s just go home.

1608
01:53:34,291 --> 01:53:38,666
Listen listen, ask him to get up.
Ask him to get up.

1609
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:40,416
Sunny…

1610
01:53:43,916 --> 01:53:47,458
Sunny, get up let’s go home.

1611
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:51,708
You called me in the morning and
you said you’ll come see me, right?

1612
01:53:54,166 --> 01:53:55,583
Sunny!

1613
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:04,583
Brother!

1614
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:35,833
Geetha committed suicide!

1615
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:13,541
What? You didn’t sleep yet?

1616
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:16,041
I’m talking with my SI brother.

1617
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,416
About Sunny?

1618
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:19,500
You?

1619
01:55:19,625 --> 01:55:22,458
I’m having some… crazy dreams.
I don’t feel good.

1620
01:55:26,791 --> 01:55:30,416
Don’t be silent. Say something.
I’m scared right now.

1621
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:35,000
Mouni... I’ll go home once.

1622
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:41,125
And tell my mom about us.

1623
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:43,583
To your mom?

1624
01:55:45,625 --> 01:55:49,500
Why? Will she agree?
What if she won’t?

1625
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:52,416
Nothing of that sorts will
happen, Mouni.

1626
01:55:54,375 --> 01:55:57,250
You paid her salary by selling your bike!
To that Venkatesham’s daughter!

1627
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,791
What else did you do?
Bloody red scorpion faced idiot!

1628
01:56:00,208 --> 01:56:02,375
-You even risked our land, you moron.
-Mom!

1629
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:04,875
-Mouni is a really good girl.
-Is it?

1630
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:07,500
Do you even know anything about them?

1631
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,583
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

1632
01:56:11,541 --> 01:56:13,083
Do you know anything about her uncle?

1633
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:16,875
Who’s he in between all this?
Mouni’s parents are good people.

1634
01:56:18,041 --> 01:56:20,791
Her parents? Ok…

1635
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:23,125
I’ll take you to their house.

1636
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:25,291
I’ll wear a costly saree.

1637
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:27,583
See what happens after we go there.

1638
01:56:27,916 --> 01:56:30,416
Without looking at our legs if
we have left our slippers out…

1639
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:32,041
Without offering us water
in separate glasses…

1640
01:56:32,083 --> 01:56:35,458
If they just talk to us normally,
you both will get married. Or else, no!

1641
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:38,083
-What’s with you, mom!
-Don’t say anything else.

1642
01:56:39,375 --> 01:56:42,791
I’ll agree to this marriage
only after you prove me wrong.

1643
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:45,958
Or else, never take her name again.

1644
01:56:49,083 --> 01:56:50,166
Ok?

1645
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,541
What, teacher?

1646
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:13,083
Isn’t sir home?

1647
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:15,958
He is. Let me call him.
Is he your son?

1648
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:20,541
Yeah. He’s running a huge dance center in
the city. And he’s earning good numbers.

1649
01:57:31,916 --> 01:57:33,958
What? What’s happening?

1650
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,583
Didn’t you get a deal on your land yet?

1651
01:57:35,583 --> 01:57:36,625
No, not that, sir.

1652
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:39,375
My brother told you, right?
His words are my words.

1653
01:57:40,916 --> 01:57:42,041
You can go.

1654
01:57:46,666 --> 01:57:49,250
You have great timing.
Here are my brother’s clothes.

1655
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:51,875
They will suit you well. They are new.

1656
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:54,208
He wore them just once. Here.

1657
01:58:16,375 --> 01:58:18,416
What? Will you leave me?

1658
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:24,875
Mouni, don't say that.

1659
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:28,500
I’ll die. I’ll die if needed,
but… I won’t leave you.

1660
01:58:33,875 --> 01:58:35,916
A little trace of doubt and
I would have killed you.

1661
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:40,541
Back in the village,
they won’t agree to our marriage.

1662
01:58:43,875 --> 01:58:45,666
What if we get married
against their wish?

1663
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:48,541
My uncle won’t leave me until I’m dead.

1664
01:58:54,458 --> 01:58:58,500
I don’t know, but let’s do something.
I can’t live in this hell anymore.

1665
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:04,416
Come on… Let’s go…

1666
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,833
Have you gone mad?

1667
01:59:28,166 --> 01:59:31,375
You asked me whether they will kill
you if you love their daughters, right?

1668
01:59:31,583 --> 01:59:33,875
Listen to me carefully…
Yes, they will kill you.

1669
01:59:35,125 --> 01:59:36,500
Get us married, brother.

1670
01:59:37,125 --> 01:59:40,000
What? Do you want me dead too?

1671
01:59:40,333 --> 01:59:42,083
Brother, you are an SI, right?

1672
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,333
So what?

1673
01:59:44,875 --> 01:59:49,375
Brother, the SI in that village killed
Sunny and framed it as an accident.

1674
01:59:49,416 --> 01:59:51,083
What are you doing then, brother?

1675
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:54,625
What the hell is he talking about?
At least you tell him.

1676
01:59:54,666 --> 01:59:56,166
Get us married, brother.

1677
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,416
Hey, they can do anything.

1678
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:04,875
They have lots of money.
They have lawyers, goons…

1679
02:00:04,875 --> 02:00:06,291
Whom do you have on your side?

1680
02:00:06,541 --> 02:00:07,791
We have you, right brother?

1681
02:00:09,166 --> 02:00:11,291
I can’t do this. Forget it.

1682
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:14,708
We have no other way out, Revanth.

1683
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:16,625
Let’s run away from the village.

1684
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:18,750
We have no one here.

1685
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:23,958
Don’t tell anyone about us, brother.

1686
02:00:24,208 --> 02:00:25,708
At least do this help.

1687
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,125
Did you decide where to go?

1688
02:00:51,916 --> 02:00:54,458
No matter where you take
her, it won’t take more than...

1689
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,833
...a week for her uncle to
know that she’s with you.

1690
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,416
Do you think he will keep calm?

1691
02:01:00,666 --> 02:01:02,583
Hey, I have thought of it a lot…

1692
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:04,500
I have read the entire
charge sheet of Sunny’s case.

1693
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:07,458
They manipulated a murder as an accident.
We have to do the same.

1694
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:10,000
We have no way out of this.

1695
02:01:11,041 --> 02:01:13,583
-What to do, brother?
-You have got settled in the city…

1696
02:01:13,583 --> 02:01:16,666
No one knows that you know her.

1697
02:01:17,291 --> 02:01:20,458
We can convince your mom somehow.
Mouni has to…

1698
02:01:21,583 --> 02:01:23,458
Aa ha… My people will kill me.

1699
02:01:23,458 --> 02:01:26,625
For your uncle to not come behind
you, eloping is not the answer.

1700
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:28,500
We have to fake her death.

1701
02:01:29,333 --> 02:01:31,875
-I didn’t get you, brother!
-Let me explain.

1702
02:01:32,833 --> 02:01:33,958
Now...

1703
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,791
This girl will go back to her home.
She stays silent for six months.

1704
02:01:36,833 --> 02:01:40,625
One morning, she’ll write a note - ‘No one
is responsible for my death’, and come out.

1705
02:01:40,666 --> 02:01:42,375
Then you can go somewhere
else and get settled.

1706
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:44,041
I’ll write my uncle’s name.
It’s better that way.

1707
02:01:44,083 --> 02:01:47,333
Damn no! If a case get’s filed, I have
to catch you two. Let’s not do all that.

1708
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:52,000
I’ll go the bridge and throw your
anklets, scarf, and sandal there.

1709
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,208
Once you write the letter and come
out, I’ll send you away in a jeep.

1710
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:56,500
You both get married and
leave to someplace else.

1711
02:01:58,583 --> 02:02:01,500
But there is a problem…
She can never go back home.

1712
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:04,583
It’s ok… Hum…

1713
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,791
That’s ok, but what will
you do in these 6 months?

1714
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,500
I have to stay away from her anyway,
right? I’ll go to Dubai, brother.

1715
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:15,250
I’ll gather some money and will
take Mouni to Dubai with me.

1716
02:02:15,541 --> 02:02:17,083
God!

1717
02:02:17,125 --> 02:02:19,708
Now we have to change her name
and make a passport on that name.

1718
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:24,083
Haa... It’s Mounika Rani, right?
What if we make it M. Rani?

1719
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:29,916
Think about it again.
Then I’ll tell you what to do.

1720
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:37,791
We need an address proof
for her in the city.

1721
02:02:38,416 --> 02:02:42,666
Go to a notary and change the name. Apply for
Aadhar card on the same name and address.

1722
02:02:44,458 --> 02:02:47,416
With all those documents,
we have to apply for a new passport.

1723
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:51,500
After that, you go meet
a Dubai agent for work.

1724
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,666
You shouldn’t have
any kind of contact.

1725
02:02:53,666 --> 02:02:55,500
Throw away your old
phones and sim cards.

1726
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:14,875
My strength just took a
hit, looking at your beauty…

1727
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:26,000
All the beauty that covered
every inch of her had chose you…

1728
02:03:29,333 --> 02:03:33,916
Hey… Mouni, you are back… I told
you, right? You can’t do it.

1729
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:42,125
All the beauty that covered
every inch of her had chose you…

1730
02:03:46,708 --> 02:03:53,833
The rangoli I make in front of my house
everyday… Let me make it on your heart.

1731
02:03:53,958 --> 02:03:58,458
Let that be my place for a hundred years.

1732
02:04:13,541 --> 02:04:19,541
The commotion in our way
is your wedding bells…

1733
02:04:20,666 --> 02:04:26,708
These scattered voices are the
traditional wedding chants.

1734
02:04:27,916 --> 02:04:33,458
You walk you way and
I walk towards you.

1735
02:04:33,875 --> 02:04:39,583
Let’s count each step as each
life we are going to be together.

1736
02:04:42,166 --> 02:04:48,166
Such strange will this
love had made of our names.

1737
02:04:49,333 --> 02:04:55,375
It has hidden me inside you, but is
asking me to leave you and walk away.

1738
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:25,500
I’ll be one step ahead of
time and will win over it.

1739
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:32,750
I’ll turn the clouds into chariots
and will take you to a ride.

1740
02:05:34,083 --> 02:05:41,750
Our love is like the sky and
darkness won’t stay for long.

1741
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:45,541
I just want to be the holy
power on your forehead.

1742
02:05:47,083 --> 02:05:52,833
Such strange will this
love had made of our names.

1743
02:05:59,625 --> 02:06:02,541
Inter-caste and inter-religion.

1744
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,041
Did you have any local address?

1745
02:06:11,166 --> 02:06:14,250
-How much time will it take, sir?
-One month, easy.

1746
02:06:16,375 --> 02:06:17,625
Do you need a date?

1747
02:06:17,625 --> 02:06:19,083
Anything is ok, sir.

1748
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:23,666
At least plan it on an auspicious day.
You are getting married, right?

1749
02:06:26,458 --> 02:06:29,333
Hey, I’ll ask Mouni.
If she has any sentiments…

1750
02:06:29,416 --> 02:06:30,958
-Ok.
-Sir… I’ll just be back, sir…

1751
02:06:35,333 --> 02:06:36,916
Brother, is Mouni there?

1752
02:06:37,083 --> 02:06:38,833
She's here. Here...

1753
02:06:39,625 --> 02:06:41,708
-Hello!
-Mouni...

1754
02:06:51,041 --> 02:06:52,458
Mouni how are you?

1755
02:06:54,125 --> 02:06:56,958
How will I be without you?
I’m dying here.

1756
02:06:57,625 --> 02:06:58,958
You left me alone, right?

1757
02:06:59,125 --> 02:07:02,041
Mouni Mouni please don’t
cry, Mouni…

1758
02:07:02,958 --> 02:07:06,333
Nothing, I’m good. I’m good.

1759
02:07:06,958 --> 02:07:08,041
How are you?

1760
02:07:08,666 --> 02:07:09,916
I’m good.

1761
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,458
Mouni, we have to get married.

1762
02:07:17,666 --> 02:07:19,416
We have got all the papers, right?

1763
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,375
We have to get married
before flying to Dubai, ok?

1764
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:26,458
I’m waiting here.

1765
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:30,875
Will you give me a ring,
or marry me with a mangalasutra?

1766
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:37,583
Let’s do… both… But first, let’s
sign in the registrar's office.

1767
02:07:39,458 --> 02:07:41,500
Mouni, do you have any sentimental date?

1768
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,500
I mean, do we have to look
for an auspicious day?

1769
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:45,625
I just want to come to you right now.

1770
02:07:45,666 --> 02:07:47,625
I’m scared to be at home.

1771
02:07:47,625 --> 02:07:51,000
But my uncle’s daughter is
getting married this 6th.

1772
02:07:51,375 --> 02:07:53,750
I don’t want to cause trouble for her.

1773
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:59,041
Let’s do this after her marriage. The
suicide plan can wait until the marriage.

1774
02:08:00,708 --> 02:08:02,541
So is 10th ok for you?

1775
02:08:02,916 --> 02:08:05,000
I’m ok with whatever you are ok
with, Mouni.

1776
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:07,375
So should I book a date here?

1777
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,750
Here? Where are you?

1778
02:08:11,875 --> 02:08:13,000
In Hyderabad.

1779
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:16,791
You came to Hyderabad and you don’t
tell me that! Won’t you meet me?

1780
02:08:17,958 --> 02:08:20,125
You are heartless… Get lost, you…

1781
02:08:22,333 --> 02:08:26,041
Mouni Mouni, won’t I be dying to meet you?
But it’s too risky.

1782
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,458
Mouni, please don’t cry.

1783
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:35,208
We have stayed separate for 6 months,
and now it’s just 10 more days.

1784
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:36,708
Don’t cry, Mouni.

1785
02:08:37,208 --> 02:08:38,458
Ok.

1786
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:51,833
Mom!

1787
02:08:53,958 --> 02:08:55,375
Mom, open the door.

1788
02:08:56,916 --> 02:08:58,458
-Revanth!
-How are you?

1789
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,166
What’s with the sudden surprise?

1790
02:09:00,208 --> 02:09:01,583
I’m here to surprise you…

1791
02:09:01,958 --> 02:09:03,375
How are you?

1792
02:09:03,375 --> 02:09:05,583
-Did you miss me?
-Come on in.

1793
02:09:06,083 --> 02:09:08,041
Humm, here, eat some.

1794
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:11,000
-Humm… Enough enough enough..enough.
-Eat some more.

1795
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:20,208
Mom, here is some tea.

1796
02:09:20,208 --> 02:09:22,250
-I’m going out with brother.
-Where to?

1797
02:09:22,416 --> 02:09:25,083
-Hey, at least have some tea.
-We'll just be back.

1798
02:09:26,083 --> 02:09:30,125
Hey, Revanth… Once Mounika come
out writing a suicide letter...

1799
02:09:30,166 --> 02:09:31,875
She’ll throw her anklets here.

1800
02:09:33,708 --> 02:09:35,375
She’ll throw the scarf inside.

1801
02:09:36,208 --> 02:09:39,041
The level is high, so they’ll think
that the body got drifted away.

1802
02:09:39,083 --> 02:09:41,833
No one will doubt anything.
Then I’ll give her a burkha…

1803
02:09:42,625 --> 02:09:45,208
I’ll get her out of the village
and she’ll catch a bus there.

1804
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:47,083
You both go somewhere
safe and get married.

1805
02:09:47,083 --> 02:09:49,291
Mounika told us that her uncle won’t
even look for the dead body, right?

1806
02:09:49,333 --> 02:09:51,541
But for safety, I’ll keep one
of Mounika’s dresses with me.

1807
02:09:51,583 --> 02:09:54,416
If something goes wrong, I’ll put that dress
on some other dead body and manage them.

1808
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:59,625
Hey, I’m here to help you, right?
Move…

1809
02:09:59,666 --> 02:10:00,958
-Ok, brother.
-Come on.

1810
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:05,625
I'll just come.

1811
02:10:10,375 --> 02:10:13,916
-Hello, tell me brother.
Mounika, all the arrangements are done.

1812
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:17,416
You come out and you'll get married
as soon as possible. Are you there?

1813
02:10:18,208 --> 02:10:21,125
Wife of Revanth, care of Dubai.
That's it!

1814
02:10:21,166 --> 02:10:22,208
Ok.

1815
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,791
There is a pot on her right shoulder.

1816
02:10:33,791 --> 02:10:35,791
Her saree is shinning.

1817
02:10:35,791 --> 02:10:37,916
She won’t come to your call.

1818
02:10:37,958 --> 02:10:39,833
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1819
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,333
There is a pot on her right shoulder.

1820
02:10:51,333 --> 02:10:53,333
Her saree is shinning.

1821
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:55,875
She won’t come to your call.

1822
02:10:55,875 --> 02:10:57,791
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1823
02:11:00,208 --> 02:11:02,458
There is a pot on her left shoulder.

1824
02:11:02,625 --> 02:11:04,458
Her saree is shinning.

1825
02:11:04,666 --> 02:11:06,708
She won’t come to our call.

1826
02:11:06,791 --> 02:11:08,750
Her name is Saranga Dariya

1827
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:13,458
-Mom...
-What?

1828
02:11:15,166 --> 02:11:16,750
-What?
-Your passport…

1829
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,500
I'm coming to Dubai? Oh my, God!

1830
02:11:26,208 --> 02:11:27,708
What’s with this new habit?

1831
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:31,583
Silver anklets to her legs.

1832
02:11:31,625 --> 02:11:33,875
Her walk makes a beautiful
sound even without them.

1833
02:11:33,916 --> 02:11:35,750
Jasmines in her braid.

1834
02:11:35,791 --> 02:11:37,958
Even without them, she smells great.

1835
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,166
Her smile won’t drop pearls.

1836
02:11:40,208 --> 02:11:42,250
But it shines for sure.

1837
02:11:42,625 --> 02:11:44,625
She likes betel nuts.

1838
02:11:44,833 --> 02:11:46,791
Or a betel leaf.

1839
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:49,125
With her front teeth…

1840
02:11:49,166 --> 02:11:51,375
If she bites her lips
with her front teeth…

1841
02:11:51,375 --> 02:11:53,750
Your heart will turn read.

1842
02:11:53,875 --> 02:11:55,875
Look at the mascara…

1843
02:11:55,916 --> 02:11:58,083
She’s like a knife
that had mascara…

1844
02:11:58,083 --> 02:12:00,416
She won’t come to your call.

1845
02:12:00,458 --> 02:12:02,583
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1846
02:12:02,708 --> 02:12:05,000
There is a pot on her right shoulder.

1847
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,958
Her saree is shinning.

1848
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,500
She won’t come to your call.

1849
02:12:09,541 --> 02:12:11,416
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1850
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,750
There is a pot on her left shoulder.

1851
02:12:13,916 --> 02:12:15,750
Her saree is shinning.

1852
02:12:15,916 --> 02:12:18,000
She won’t come to our call.

1853
02:12:18,083 --> 02:12:20,041
Her name is Saranga Dariya

1854
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:00,583
The clothes that had no color…

1855
02:13:00,583 --> 02:13:02,875
Once her braid touches it,
it gets filled with color.

1856
02:13:02,916 --> 02:13:05,041
Her words are strong as a clove.

1857
02:13:05,125 --> 02:13:07,125
Mess with her and she is a lioness.

1858
02:13:07,125 --> 02:13:09,458
She’s a sarangi without strings.

1859
02:13:09,458 --> 02:13:11,666
Try to play her and she is a cannon.

1860
02:13:11,916 --> 02:13:13,916
She’s a doll.

1861
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,083
a bird you can’t catch.

1862
02:13:16,208 --> 02:13:18,375
She won’t come to your call.

1863
02:13:18,541 --> 02:13:20,875
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1864
02:13:20,916 --> 02:13:23,083
Her cheeks glow like moonshine.

1865
02:13:23,125 --> 02:13:25,125
Her ear rings shine bright.

1866
02:13:25,166 --> 02:13:27,166
She won’t come to your call.

1867
02:13:27,208 --> 02:13:29,583
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1868
02:13:32,041 --> 02:13:34,166
If the fold on her hips shine…

1869
02:13:34,208 --> 02:13:36,333
Guys just lose their world!

1870
02:13:36,458 --> 02:13:38,708
She won’t come to your call.

1871
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:40,791
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1872
02:13:43,208 --> 02:13:45,500
There is a pot on her right shoulder.

1873
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:47,500
Her saree is shinning.

1874
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:50,041
She won’t come to your call.

1875
02:13:50,083 --> 02:13:51,958
She’s Saranga Dariya.

1876
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,291
There is a pot on her left shoulder.

1877
02:13:54,416 --> 02:13:56,291
Her saree is shinning.

1878
02:13:56,458 --> 02:13:58,541
She won’t come to our call.

1879
02:13:58,583 --> 02:14:00,583
Her name is Saranga Dariya

1880
02:14:37,458 --> 02:14:39,041
-Revanth, M. Rani...
-Sir.

1881
02:14:39,125 --> 02:14:42,083
Rani is not here yet.
She will… She got a little late, sir.

1882
02:14:45,958 --> 02:14:47,666
-Kiran Vandana?
-Yeah.

1883
02:14:47,708 --> 02:14:49,166
You guys come in.

1884
02:14:49,208 --> 02:14:50,583
Ok, brother?

1885
02:14:56,833 --> 02:14:58,125
Brother… What happened?

1886
02:14:58,541 --> 02:15:01,333
I’m here at the bridge…
Mounika is not here yet.

1887
02:15:03,916 --> 02:15:05,041
Brother, what happened?

1888
02:15:05,083 --> 02:15:06,250
Mounika didn’t come…

1889
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:07,833
-What?
-Brother is still waiting there.

1890
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,333
Brother, here are your
Dubai tickets and passports.

1891
02:15:16,541 --> 02:15:17,875
-Thanks!
-Thanks.

1892
02:15:18,791 --> 02:15:19,916
Give me the bag.

1893
02:15:26,625 --> 02:15:27,666
Brother, did she come?

1894
02:15:27,708 --> 02:15:31,041
Not yet… It’s already late… It’s
risky for me to stay here for long.

1895
02:15:31,791 --> 02:15:33,625
Brother… She will come. You stay there.

1896
02:15:33,666 --> 02:15:35,916
Ok ok… I’ll wait here, ok?

1897
02:15:43,375 --> 02:15:46,875
-Hey, side on that side.
-Thank you so much.

1898
02:15:47,125 --> 02:15:49,791
-This is all because of your support.
-Congrats!

1899
02:15:49,791 --> 02:15:51,833
-Thank you!
-Congrats, dude!

1900
02:15:53,291 --> 02:15:55,625
-Giri's house is all set, ok?
-Thank you so much.

1901
02:15:55,833 --> 02:15:58,250
-I have arranged everything.
-Yeah!

1902
02:15:58,583 --> 02:16:00,416
We have to have a party!

1903
02:16:00,458 --> 02:16:02,708
-Finally!
-Thank you so much!

1904
02:16:36,208 --> 02:16:37,416
Mouni...

1905
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,583
Mouni...

1906
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:55,833
What happened, Mouni?

1907
02:16:55,875 --> 02:16:58,916
-Did you think that I cheated you?
-No!

1908
02:16:59,333 --> 02:17:01,250
No no, never…

1909
02:17:02,666 --> 02:17:04,125
Don't cry.

1910
02:17:08,541 --> 02:17:11,333
I came there… I came running…

1911
02:17:22,416 --> 02:17:24,208
Eh Ramya, where are you going?

1912
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:25,458
Going home, uncle.

1913
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,333
-Come, get on, I’ll drop you.
-No, I'll walk.

1914
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:28,750
Eh, come sit.

1915
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:32,875
Ramya!

1916
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:37,750
Sit close.

1917
02:17:42,916 --> 02:17:44,125
Ramya!

1918
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:46,208
Ramya!

1919
02:17:48,166 --> 02:17:49,208
Ramya!

1920
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:56,083
Ramya!

1921
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:01,916
Ramya!

1922
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:11,333
What happened, Mouni?

1923
02:18:12,583 --> 02:18:14,708
That Anaconda won’t leave kids…

1924
02:18:16,583 --> 02:18:18,500
He destroyed my life…

1925
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,333
You danced well…

1926
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:22,958
-This chocolate is for you, come on.
-Thank you, uncle.

1927
02:18:32,083 --> 02:18:33,291
No, uncle!

1928
02:18:47,541 --> 02:18:52,083
I got really scared. I stopped dancing.
I stopped playing.

1929
02:18:52,833 --> 02:18:56,125
I was scared to go to school,
thinking if he’ll come to drop me off.

1930
02:18:56,166 --> 02:18:58,583
-Mom… I won’t go with uncle.
-Mouni!

1931
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,750
What? Don’t act smart!

1932
02:19:00,791 --> 02:19:02,333
Mouni you have to go to school, right?

1933
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:04,208
You love school, right?

1934
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:07,666
No, mom. I won’t go with uncle.

1935
02:19:08,541 --> 02:19:12,833
I used to hear his bike’s
sound even in my sleep!

1936
02:19:14,083 --> 02:19:16,625
Don't tell anyone about
what uncle did, ok?

1937
02:19:19,583 --> 02:19:21,166
-If you do...
-Mom!

1938
02:19:21,708 --> 02:19:23,208
Will you?

1939
02:19:28,166 --> 02:19:30,916
Now he has his eyes on my sister.

1940
02:19:32,958 --> 02:19:35,083
I can’t come out leaving her with him.

1941
02:19:52,708 --> 02:19:55,083
This is not the way, Mouni.
This is not the way.

1942
02:19:56,625 --> 02:20:00,125
We have to speak… Speak about
this in front of your family.

1943
02:20:02,583 --> 02:20:06,875
Not for us to get married, but for
the sake of your sister we should.

1944
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:10,166
We have to drag him onto the roads!

1945
02:20:14,833 --> 02:20:17,916
Mouni you are scared even after all
these years. Then what about your sister?

1946
02:20:19,083 --> 02:20:22,083
Will you keep protecting
her all your life?

1947
02:20:22,666 --> 02:20:24,541
How long will you do that for?

1948
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:28,708
Mouni come on. Listen to me, let’s go.

1949
02:20:57,291 --> 02:20:58,708
What’s this?

1950
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,291
Where’s dad?

1951
02:21:01,833 --> 02:21:03,000
You first get inside.

1952
02:21:03,041 --> 02:21:05,208
Call your husband too…
Let’s talk right here.

1953
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:07,000
Look, there is a marriage happening here.

1954
02:21:07,041 --> 02:21:09,000
Making a scene here is not good for you.

1955
02:21:09,541 --> 02:21:11,583
-It's about our respect.
-Hell with respect...

1956
02:21:12,541 --> 02:21:15,458
Your daughter needs to talk to you.
Mouni, go on.

1957
02:21:17,208 --> 02:21:18,458
-Mom...
-Enough.

1958
02:21:18,583 --> 02:21:21,458
I’ll talk to her. Please leave.

1959
02:21:24,291 --> 02:21:26,500
Did you ever talk to your daughter?

1960
02:21:27,541 --> 02:21:32,583
You’ll ask if she’s talking to a boy,
wearing decent clothes, where she is going…

1961
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:37,583
But did you ever ask why she’s not eating, or
playing, or why she’s scared all the time!

1962
02:21:40,083 --> 02:21:43,750
You keep saying, ‘Go to the uncle’,
‘Aunty will take good care of you’…

1963
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:47,458
But you never think why they don’t like
certain people, or not going to their house.

1964
02:21:54,375 --> 02:21:58,000
Your daughter not falling in love
doesn’t mean raising her fine…

1965
02:22:02,083 --> 02:22:05,500
Even a 10-years-old girl should be
able to talk to you. Talk to them.

1966
02:22:06,916 --> 02:22:08,583
Talk to your kids.

1967
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:12,375
Who will talk to the
kids, if not the mother?

1968
02:22:36,958 --> 02:22:39,916
Hey, how dare you come here?

1969
02:22:40,125 --> 02:22:41,458
Hey!

1970
02:22:41,458 --> 02:22:43,541
How dare you touch me!

1971
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,541
Dad… It’s because of him.

1972
02:22:48,875 --> 02:22:51,291
It’s because of him...
My childhood got destroyed.

1973
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:55,041
I stopped going to school.
I stopped playing.

1974
02:22:55,541 --> 02:22:58,333
I was scared to even be at home, dad.

1975
02:23:06,333 --> 02:23:09,541
What’s with this new drama?

1976
02:23:09,625 --> 02:23:11,583
What? Are you drunk or what?

1977
02:23:11,625 --> 02:23:13,333
Have you gone blind?

1978
02:23:13,333 --> 02:23:16,791
See see… Can’t you see the new
drama your daughter is putting up?

1979
02:23:16,833 --> 02:23:18,083
She brought this on to our house.

1980
02:23:18,083 --> 02:23:22,458
She'll get married to this low caste filth and
ask for a bed for their first night. Will you?

1981
02:23:22,458 --> 02:23:24,625
-Who’s the filth here? Who’s the filth?
-[commotion]

1982
02:23:24,625 --> 02:23:28,083
You spoiled a girl’s life, you are hiding
behind caste! She’s like your daughter.

1983
02:23:28,083 --> 02:23:30,333
-Unethical moron.
-This is just because of you.

1984
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,541
-Is this what you are doing in the city?
-Don't believe him, dad!

1985
02:23:33,583 --> 02:23:37,583
-Who's low caste? Come out!
-Dad, listen to me.

1986
02:23:38,125 --> 02:23:39,791
Who is low caste!

1987
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:41,583
-Open the door.
-You...

1988
02:23:41,625 --> 02:23:43,333
-Stop!
-Open the door!

1989
02:23:43,458 --> 02:23:46,291
-I'm going to kill you today.
-Dad, stop!

1990
02:23:46,833 --> 02:23:48,166
Let her go!

1991
02:23:57,666 --> 02:24:01,208
Touch my daughter again and the street
dogs will be feeding on your bones.

1992
02:24:08,458 --> 02:24:12,166
Listen to me, son.
You guys just go away.

1993
02:24:12,541 --> 02:24:17,166
She kept all this pain to
herself and lived life like hell.

1994
02:24:18,708 --> 02:24:20,500
I did nothing as a mother…

1995
02:24:21,416 --> 02:24:23,000
You take her away.

1996
02:24:24,291 --> 02:24:26,166
These people are not even humans.

1997
02:24:27,625 --> 02:24:29,583
Hey, he’s eloping with our girl.

1998
02:24:29,916 --> 02:24:31,541
I’m at my brother's house, come here.

1999
02:24:31,583 --> 02:24:34,083
Mouni, it’s not safe for
you guys to stay here.

2000
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:34,875
Mom...

2001
02:24:34,916 --> 02:24:37,000
-Go… Go…
-Mom!

2002
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,083
I’ll take care of your sister.
I’m there for her.

2003
02:24:40,708 --> 02:24:41,541
Open up!

2004
02:24:41,583 --> 02:24:43,958
You leave before he gets out.

2005
02:24:45,458 --> 02:24:47,500
They will kill this boy.

2006
02:24:47,875 --> 02:24:50,541
Listen to me.
I’ll take care of your sister.

2007
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:54,458
I’ll protect her.
Come on, son. Come on.

2008
02:24:54,791 --> 02:24:57,416
Brother... Are you dead? Stop her.

2009
02:24:59,541 --> 02:25:01,375
Go fast…

2010
02:25:04,083 --> 02:25:07,208
Go… Go… Go…

2011
02:25:08,291 --> 02:25:09,625
Go… Go…

2012
02:25:21,916 --> 02:25:23,000
Revanth!

2013
02:25:23,583 --> 02:25:25,750
-Mouni!
-Revanth...

2014
02:25:27,708 --> 02:25:29,208
-Revanth, come on.
-Mouni.

2015
02:25:29,666 --> 02:25:30,958
Mouni, come on.

2016
02:25:38,291 --> 02:25:41,875
-Mom... Mom open the door!
-What...

2017
02:25:44,666 --> 02:25:45,875
What happened?

2018
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:53,000
He took a loan on Zumba.
He sold Zumba to go to Dubai.

2019
02:25:53,041 --> 02:25:54,708
Now he left Dubai
and brought you home!

2020
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:56,708
-Mouni.
-Drink. That's how we have to live now.

2021
02:25:56,708 --> 02:25:58,583
-Mom, come fast.
-Shut up!

2022
02:25:58,625 --> 02:26:00,250
-Move!
-Look at what you did!

2023
02:26:07,791 --> 02:26:10,708
Put this on.

2024
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:12,166
-Come on.
-Fast... Come on.

2025
02:26:12,291 --> 02:26:13,708
-Move.
-Fast!

2026
02:26:19,333 --> 02:26:22,833
Mouni, this way. Come on.

2027
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,791
Search!

2028
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:27,750
-Where's Revanth! Hey!
-[commotion]

2029
02:26:29,333 --> 02:26:30,833
-Mom...
-Aunty!

2030
02:26:40,250 --> 02:26:43,458
-Come out. Where's Revanth?
-I have no idea.

2031
02:26:44,166 --> 02:26:45,500
Mom, come on.

2032
02:26:46,041 --> 02:26:50,208
-Not in my house. My uncle will kill me.
-We have no place else to go.

2033
02:26:50,416 --> 02:26:53,500
-Dude, please!
-No no, please leave. Please!

2034
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,416
Mom! Mom, are you hurt?

2035
02:26:57,958 --> 02:26:59,208
No, I'm ok.

2036
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,666
-I can't... anymore.
-Mom, what happened?

2037
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:06,916
-What happened?
-Nothing.

2038
02:27:07,916 --> 02:27:09,875
-Does it hurt?
-No, it's nothing.

2039
02:27:10,291 --> 02:27:12,500
Mom, we have to keep moving.
Let's go.

2040
02:27:13,625 --> 02:27:14,708
Come on, mom.

2041
02:27:27,125 --> 02:27:29,041
This way...

2042
02:27:30,416 --> 02:27:32,416
Mom, backwards… More.

2043
02:27:40,041 --> 02:27:41,916
Hey, this belongs to them.

2044
02:27:42,625 --> 02:27:43,875
What, mom?

2045
02:27:43,875 --> 02:27:45,625
This graveyard belongs to them.

2046
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,750
What if someone sees?

2047
02:27:55,166 --> 02:27:58,416
What doesn't belong to them?
Huh... What?

2048
02:27:59,666 --> 02:28:01,541
Our lives belong to them.

2049
02:28:01,583 --> 02:28:03,583
We are different until death.

2050
02:28:03,625 --> 02:28:06,125
And now even after death
there is a difference!

2051
02:28:06,333 --> 02:28:08,416
We are the ones who work hard.
And we are not allowed in!

2052
02:28:08,458 --> 02:28:10,000
Hey, have you gone mad?

2053
02:28:10,041 --> 02:28:12,333
Of course, I have gone mad.

2054
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:15,375
These lands belong to them and they rule.

2055
02:28:15,416 --> 02:28:16,791
Our lives belong to them.

2056
02:28:16,791 --> 02:28:20,333
Where should we stay, how much should we
sell our land for, where should we die,

2057
02:28:20,333 --> 02:28:22,125
where should we go
after death… With them

2058
02:28:22,125 --> 02:28:24,083
dictating all this,
of course, I have gone mad!

2059
02:28:24,125 --> 02:28:27,916
Don’t run, they will kill you.
Let’s escape silently.

2060
02:28:27,916 --> 02:28:30,583
Where should we go to? And why?

2061
02:28:31,625 --> 02:28:33,000
Why should we escape?

2062
02:28:33,708 --> 02:28:35,833
No, Revanth. Listen to me.

2063
02:28:35,833 --> 02:28:40,208
Let’s call SI brother. He’ll help us.
Let’s go to the city.

2064
02:28:40,291 --> 02:28:42,375
They will kill brother too.

2065
02:28:42,791 --> 02:28:44,541
Your uncle will kill us.

2066
02:28:44,625 --> 02:28:47,041
He’ll kill your mom too.

2067
02:28:47,666 --> 02:28:50,666
I even feel that we did a
mistake leaving them behind.

2068
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,958
Not that I want us to die...

2069
02:28:53,291 --> 02:28:56,166
But I can’t live running.

2070
02:28:56,916 --> 02:28:59,125
Let’s die if we have to.
But let’s fight back hard.

2071
02:29:04,916 --> 02:29:05,833
Didn't find them?

2072
02:29:05,833 --> 02:29:08,041
Search properly.
They'll be here somewhere.

2073
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:19,541
Don't let them go.
Once you find them, kill her frist.

2074
02:29:19,750 --> 02:29:22,750
Then kill him and his mother. Get it?

2075
02:29:23,916 --> 02:29:25,125
You, bloody!

2076
02:30:01,416 --> 02:30:03,541
How did you even touch her?
She’s like your daughter.

2077
02:30:03,541 --> 02:30:06,041
Are you even human! Damn you!

2078
02:30:06,583 --> 02:30:08,500
Let go of him.

2079
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:11,000
You might kill him. Let him go.

2080
02:30:11,541 --> 02:30:15,208
Revanth!

2081
02:30:15,208 --> 02:30:17,833
Where will you run off to?

2082
02:30:18,166 --> 02:30:19,750
-Bloody! Can't you be quiet?
-Leave!

2083
02:30:19,791 --> 02:30:21,625
How dare you spoil my image?

2084
02:30:22,333 --> 02:30:25,708
-What will he do now? Huh?
-Don't touch me.

2085
02:30:25,833 --> 02:30:28,166
-I'll kill you in front of his eyes.
-Don't touch me.

2086
02:30:28,166 --> 02:30:31,250
How dare you mess with my name in
the village? See how I’ll kill you.

2087
02:30:35,875 --> 02:30:38,250
Mouni... Mouni, are you ok?

2088
02:30:44,375 --> 02:30:47,375
-Did he die?
-Mouni... Mouni are you ok?

2089
02:30:47,708 --> 02:30:48,833
-Hey...
-Mouni!

2090
02:30:49,875 --> 02:30:52,125
He would have killed her.
Can't you see that?

2091
02:30:54,333 --> 02:30:58,666
Mouni... Mouni, why are you crying?

2092
02:31:00,291 --> 02:31:02,541
We just killed an evil person.

2093
02:31:03,166 --> 02:31:06,333
Not just for our sake. For the kids
and the people of this village too.

2094
02:31:10,708 --> 02:31:12,041
It's his mistake.

2095
02:31:12,833 --> 02:31:17,125
Will they send me to prison? Let them.
10 - 20 years... I don't care.

2096
02:31:18,916 --> 02:31:20,791
How can we live seperated?

2097
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,375
I'll kill myself. I can't do this.

2098
02:31:28,083 --> 02:31:30,916
We have to, Mouni. We have to live.

2099
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:34,041
This world exists only
for people like us.

2100
02:31:34,875 --> 02:31:37,916
Not for the ones who calculate life with
caste, religion, and family respect.

2101
02:31:48,291 --> 02:31:53,000
Sir, my son did nothing wrong.
Sir, I beg you, plese!

2102
02:31:53,708 --> 02:31:56,083
-Narasimham is not a good man.
-Let's go.

2103
02:31:56,083 --> 02:31:59,958
See what you did. You killed my son!

2104
02:32:00,166 --> 02:32:02,916
-Mouni, it's ok...
-I won't let you go.

2105
02:32:02,958 --> 02:32:04,250
Ma'am, please move!

2106
02:32:04,333 --> 02:32:05,833
He's going to pay for this.

2107
02:32:06,166 --> 02:32:09,125
We won't leave him. She brought
a street dog into our house to...

2108
02:32:09,416 --> 02:32:10,541
Hey!

2109
02:32:11,125 --> 02:32:13,208
Say one more thing about
Revanth and you are done!

2110
02:32:13,833 --> 02:32:17,208
You should have been this angry on your
son and he would have grown up better.

2111
02:32:17,250 --> 02:32:20,375
You should have kept an eye on him,
not me. And I would have been saved.

2112
02:32:22,958 --> 02:32:24,791
-I can't live without you.
-Don't cry, Mouni.

2113
02:32:24,791 --> 02:32:26,875
-Move aside!
-Revanth!

2114
02:32:29,833 --> 02:32:31,500
-Revanth!
-Move aside.

2115
02:32:31,541 --> 02:32:34,666
Mouni, everything will be fine.
I'll be back soon.

2116
02:32:35,875 --> 02:32:38,541
-Mouni, stop running. Mouni!
-Revath.

2117
02:32:39,083 --> 02:32:40,291
Mouni, take care!

2118
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,083
This is not done on purpose.

2119
02:33:11,208 --> 02:33:14,708
Late Saitlu Narasimham tried
to hide his wrong doings...

2120
02:33:14,875 --> 02:33:16,666
By killing Mounika Rani.

2121
02:33:16,916 --> 02:33:18,750
Only in an effort to save her...

2122
02:33:18,875 --> 02:33:21,833
Accused Revanth pushed
Saitlu Narasimham away...

2123
02:33:21,875 --> 02:33:24,416
And he died taking a fall.
The court believe so.
