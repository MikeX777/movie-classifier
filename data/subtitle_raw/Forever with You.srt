1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:07,671
<i>FOREVER WITH YOU</i>

2
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,805
What a bright moon... Shit!

3
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,682
Why? Aren't you sleepy?

4
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,758
One day before their release,
everyone feels the same.

5
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,197
You might feel sick and tired of this jail.

6
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,495
You pig! Sorry, but I graduate
from here in 10 years.

7
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,040
Well, good for you!

8
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,567
Be nice to him, he's out tomorrow.

9
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,040
Dude! Hunch your back and get some sleep.

10
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,150
Dude! You can get hurt on the outside.

11
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,520
What can you do?

12
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,185
Since you were in jail,
your fate isn't that great.

13
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,326
Don't worry.
There's someone waiting for me.

14
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,567
It must be a girl

15
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:03,037
who lies through her red lips.

16
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,312
-I had a girl before, too.
-Shut up!

17
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,084
-My girl is...
-Do you think she's waiting for you?

18
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,412
-Of course.
-Is she your wife?

19
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,488
-That's not the point.
-You really love her.

20
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,861
I'm sure she's waiting.
She's not the one you think.

21
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,629
-You don't know her.
-Is she your first love?

22
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,463
Yes.

23
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,804
-She's my childhood friend.
-Life is the best at that time.

24
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,613
The place I grew up was

25
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,850
such a poor village, even at night.

26
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,446
<i>Everyday late at night</i>

27
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,389
<i>we used to come back to our village</i>.

28
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,891
<i>Ae-ran worked at a bakery until late</i>.

29
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,933
<i>I only had the pleasure of walking</i>
<i>with her at night</i>.

30
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,779
Well,

31
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,416
Bye, bye!

32
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,150
Where do you go every day?

33
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,556
-Won't you eat?
-Why did you cook rice?

34
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,391
I owed Ae-ran again.

35
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,493
You did? Don't do it. Pay it back soon.

36
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,070
Where did you get this money?

37
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,273
Huh?

38
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,581
-You can just use it.
-Let me know where.

39
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,552
-Where did you get it?
-I got some work.

40
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,321
What is that? Gwang-pil

41
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,698
You can't be like your dad,
even if we are starving to death.

42
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,262
<i>My humble mother,</i>
<i>who lost her husband to gambling</i>.

43
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,842
<i>But I was already with Dal-soo</i>.

44
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,771
<i>He was good at playing the harmonica,</i>
<i>so I hated him</i>.

45
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,985
Hey, let's go!

46
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,662
-Dude!
-Shhh!

47
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,926
-How unlucky.
-Why?

48
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,001
-That's all I've got.
-What?

49
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,160
-What about you?
-Huh?

50
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,270
-The one just now.
-Did you come to nothing?

51
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,203
-Dude, let me in.
-Find a good target.

52
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,207
-Dude, let me in.
-Shut up and follow me.

53
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,343
I lost my precious money...

54
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,252
-She's poor.
-Let's get the money back to her.

55
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,459
What? Dude, are You crazy?

56
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,557
You must not be hungry to be able to say that.

57
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,863
What's up with him?
He's supposed to be here in 5 minutes.

58
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,667
-He's gone to the bakery.
-Son of...

59
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,582
Why there?

60
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,053
Watch out! He buys Ae-ran gum...

61
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,650
He's very nice to her.

62
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,283
He's making vain efforts.

63
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,124
He said that Ae-ran asked him to teach her
how to play the harmonica.

64
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,891
He was boasting about it.

65
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,343
It looks nice? You wanna try?

66
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,375
-How can I play?
-It's very easy.

67
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,213
I'll teach you.

68
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:28,119
See, Do Re Mi Fa, huh?

69
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,712
-See. You can do it.
-Yes

70
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,180
It sounds pretty, like your face.

71
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,452
Good. You play well.

72
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,056
You...

73
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,656
Well,

74
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,406
You can play as well? Try it, huh?

75
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,236
Pish!

76
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,503
Why are you getting angry?

77
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,450
-Get away!
-Why are you running riot?

78
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,482
-Pick it up.
-Let's go out, man!

79
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,788
You wanna fight?

80
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,917
You will know your ribs are broken
when you hear a snap.

81
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,514
-What?
-Bastard! Let's go

82
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,048
Oh! What are you guys doing? Oh, my...

83
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,787
What the heck is this?

84
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,692
-Clean it.
-Get away!

85
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,195
-Look at this blood.
-I won't talk to you anymore.

86
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,908
Are you mad because
I played Dal-soo's harmonica?

87
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,046
-Did you really hate it?
-I don't know.

88
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,783
I won't even look at him later.

89
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,089
It must be painful. What a bad guy!

90
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,785
Look at the dust on your shirt.

91
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,390
Did you really like his harmonica?

92
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,660
No! I don't, not now.

93
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,073
Ae-ran, you must be a sleepyhead.

94
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,206
Why?

95
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,317
I feel sleepy too, lying beside you.

96
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,181
Then, go to sleep.

97
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,194
You're not a grown up.
You can't snore like that.

98
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,172
Yes, I am. I have hair on my legs.

99
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,909
-See!
-Oh my!

100
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,848
See, see!

101
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,292
Here you can hang out
the washing and this is...

102
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,964
I like sky blue.

103
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,399
-On this wall?
-Yes.

104
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,870
-I'll get red curtains on the window.
-That would be nice.

105
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,771
-How many sons will you have?
-I don't know.

106
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,080
Who knows, if the person
who will give birth doesn't?

107
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,152
-I don't know, I don't know.
-Oh, it's cold.

108
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,752
What should we do?

109
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,589
Let's go over there!

110
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,016
Oh, it's cold!

111
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,697
Look at that! Our house fell down.

112
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,936
We can get wet here, too.
Let's go under the tree.

113
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,495
-Okay
-Hurry!

114
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,642
It's cold!

115
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,368
-You must be cold.
-No

116
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,039
Why is it raining, bloody hell!

117
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,748
-We won't forget today!
-Right.

118
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,454
Oh, It's cold.

119
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,159
I grew this much more than last year.

120
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,997
-Let me measure my height.
-Sure.

121
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,034
Well,

122
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,842
Look here and smile.

123
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,783
Get closer to each other.

124
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,043
Wait, I have something in my eye.

125
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,184
-Let me see.
-It tickles.

126
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,350
Stay still.

127
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,722
Ah!

128
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,625
-Is it better?
-Yes.

129
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,897
-Mister!
-You can have your picture tomorrow.

130
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,599
I've already taken it. What a beautiful scene.

131
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,936
Your breath can take away a lover's pain.

132
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,008
Dude...

133
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,182
-Look at this picture.
-Well

134
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,286
-It looks nice.
-Really?

135
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,720
-Does it?
-Yes.

136
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,822
-The photographer is weird, isn't he?
-Yes.

137
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,373
Huh, what?

138
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,805
How did you get the picture?

139
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,350
A man like me has enough money.

140
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,585
I know everything.

141
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,978
-You can't hide anything from me.
-What?

142
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,786
You pick people's pockets.

143
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,261
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

144
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,359
Get me some water.

145
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,262
You'd better feel ashamed, a man like you.

146
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,933
-What's up with her?
-Forget it! I won't talk to you anymore.

147
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,329
Did you tell her?

148
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,811
Tell her Amen.

149
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,643
-So you don't like money?
-Pish!

150
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,720
Tell me you don't like it.

151
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,157
A Wa Yu Wei

152
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,768
O, Yo, Yo Don(Money) money, money!

153
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,170
Money!

154
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,404
Who said I don't like money?

155
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,248
-I thought you were dumb.
-You're mean.

156
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,013
-Got irritated?
-I mean it.

157
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,881
Don't get close to them.
They're like gangsters.

158
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,386
-What?
-You might get caught.

159
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,790
Never do it again?

160
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,838
Why won't you say anything?

161
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,607
A <i>o o o</i> huh?

162
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,315
-Do you get it?
-Pish!

163
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,423
You go!

164
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,796
Hurry, you brat!

165
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,366
Hurry!

166
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,178
It's strange that you entered this school.

167
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,848
First time, I could have gone
to juvenile reformatory for three years.

168
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:08,390
Had I been patient,
I wouldn't have been like this.

169
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,657
Once a user, forever a custom.

170
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,634
That's because I was too young.

171
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,876
It was 5 months after I went to jail.

172
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:35,142
That's right.
I went to the interview room and...

173
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,555
Ae-ran!

174
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:41,890
Ae-ran!

175
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:46,996
Such a fool!

176
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,002
What did I tell you?

177
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,214
Look in the mirror.
You should take a look at yourself.

178
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,275
How's my mother?

179
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,549
I'm sure it's hard for her.
How's her illness?

180
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,717
What? Huh?

181
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,838
-She passed away.
-What?

182
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,506
-When?
-A while ago.

183
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,006
Really, huh?

184
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,978
-Mother
-Don't cry.

185
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,610
Mother

186
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,921
How did she close her eyes?

187
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,922
All alone, in an empty room, with nobody.

188
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,004
-Where was she buried?
-Around a grave site...

189
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,773
The seniors in the village took care of her.

190
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:17,221
I've been busy so I couldn't come to see you.

191
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,653
The bakery was burned down.

192
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,788
Now...

193
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,300
I work at Yonseon-ok.

194
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,347
-What? Uncle Gombo's?
-Yes.

195
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,515
Are you crazy? Why do you work at a bar?

196
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,685
You know my situation.

197
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,491
-Time's up.
-Ae-ran.

198
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,995
Please quit working at the bar, eh?

199
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:01,791
I see.

200
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,798
<i>That night, I thought</i>
<i>there was no way other than</i>

201
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,704
<i>prison breaking to calm my heart</i>.

202
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,975
<i>And I'd been looking for a chance,</i>
<i>and one day</i>...

203
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,613
Ae-ran! Ae-ran!

204
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,216
Come out!

205
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,488
Hey

206
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,697
Tell the girl that Gwang-pil

207
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,959
-came, will you?
-Yes, sir.

208
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,643
Ae-ran!

209
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,308
Ae-ran! Here.

210
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,748
How did you get out?

211
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,581
I missed you so much.

212
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,623
-Then, you broke out of jail?
-It's all right.

213
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,523
As long as you're with me,

214
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,495
I have nothing to fear.

215
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:53,207
I wish it were a dream, oh my.

216
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,181
Let's run far away, shall we?

217
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,182
-No way.
-Why not?

218
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,943
Shall I leave you at this bar,

219
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,646
and go back to jail?

220
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,358
What can we do then?

221
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,493
You're the only one that is left for me,

222
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,959
and my mother's grave.

223
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,228
You put lonely me into jail alone...

224
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,579
I'll be waiting for you for a long time.

225
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,407
Forever

226
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,115
Ae-ran!

227
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,485
Ae-ran!

228
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,557
Where did this girl go?

229
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:50,027
-Ae-ran!
-Oh, no. Not in here.

230
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,796
-Stay still
-Later...

231
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,566
-It's all right
-Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

232
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,998
Get me some food, huh?

233
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,008
Hey, Ae-ran!

234
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,127
Are you Gwang-pil?

235
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,584
If she's your lover, why doesn't she
come to see you, not even once?

236
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,685
Because she's worried that
I might run away again.

237
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,931
She has been sending clothes
and food every month for 6 or 7 years.

238
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,701
My Ae-ran is that faithful a girl.

239
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,541
Trust is the mother of deceit.

240
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,276
Brat!

241
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,616
She must write a letter,

242
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,019
saying " Keep the faith, love Kim Ae-ran''

243
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,982
Our life has been deceived by hope.

244
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,662
When I get out this time,
I'll become a new person.

245
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,858
-Oho Gwang-pil!
-Yes?

246
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,861
It's a suit sent for you.

247
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,032
Put it on when you are released tomorrow.

248
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,599
Hurrah, guard!

249
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,608
See! She sent clothes for tomorrow.

250
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,609
Ae-ran will not sleep well tonight either.

251
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,049
-Shut up
-Ae-ran!

252
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,658
You're hurting my feelings.

253
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,590
Hey, you should consider a person like me.

254
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,131
When you get out, come and see me.

255
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,699
-It'll be faster to see you again in here.
-What?

256
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,671
No, it's just a joke.

257
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,071
Be happy with her after you get out.

258
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,175
Be happy together.
I'll be here doing nothing.

259
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,682
What a man...

260
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,880
-Gwang-pil!
-Huh?

261
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,372
-Don't you recognize me?
-Oh Sang-moon!

262
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,144
-Buddy!
-Thank you.

263
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,147
You must have had a hard time.

264
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,981
It's all in the past now.

265
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,350
How did you know?

266
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,458
I thought you guys had forgotten about me.

267
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,395
Did you come alone?

268
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,531
Yes.

269
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:25,534
If any, there's another myself
wearing this priest's suit.

270
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,909
-Let's go!
-Wait.

271
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,074
She must be coming...

272
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,477
-Who?
-You might know her, Ae-ran.

273
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,024
-Ah! Once you met...
-Yes.

274
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,255
She sent me clothes every month.

275
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,298
You never change.

276
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,264
Where does Ae-ran live now?

277
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,595
Huh? What's she doing?

278
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,501
Let's go anyways.

279
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,945
She might not come
because of a personal problem.

280
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,139
Let's wait for her for a while.

281
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,510
She might be disappointed
if she comes late and can't find me.

282
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,673
All right then.

283
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,614
Is this your car?
You must be successful.

284
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:23,397
-What happened to you anyways?
-The day you were caught...

285
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,197
I went to a catholic church right away.

286
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,038
I confessed all my sins to a father,

287
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,677
and cried all night.

288
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,438
-Then the father led you to...?
-Yes

289
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,213
Thanks to him, I went to a seminary.

290
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:50,417
My desire to save you spiritually

291
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,130
-made me wear this suit.
-I see.

292
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,794
Without you,

293
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,702
I would have looked up
at the stars of my cursed destiny,

294
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,072
and wandered a street of sin.

295
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,173
I see.

296
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:11,613
I learned hairdressing at school.

297
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,318
I used to do the hair of higher-ups.

298
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,317
I see.

299
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,414
I made some money,
so when I buy some tools,

300
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,220
I can get a job anywhere.

301
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,226
Then, I can make Ae-ran happy.

302
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,462
I am very confident now.

303
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,936
When we were younger,

304
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,979
I made a promise with Ae-ran.

305
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,508
We drew a picture of our house on the sand.

306
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,509
We dreamt of a beautiful house.

307
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,454
The sky without bars.

308
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,155
A red curtain on the wall.

309
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,161
It's like a dream, but I'll make it come true.

310
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,100
Amen!

311
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,438
-Take a rest.
-Yes.

312
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,847
It's all for you that I come to this holy room.

313
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,458
-Will you smoke?
-No.

314
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:34,064
I lost the taste. A friend is the best.

315
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,169
If you didn't come,

316
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:44,465
I'd have nothing to do now besides standing

317
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,068
in front of the gate of the prison.

318
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:51,045
-Let's drink. I've some western wine.
-Well...

319
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:57,420
Why did Ae-ran not come?
Today...

320
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:06,154
I've got this good quality wine
to celebrate your release.

321
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:06,958
Huh?

322
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,501
I missed her so much.

323
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,441
Before we drink this first shot,

324
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,447
I want you to forgive me
who never went to see you.

325
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,686
It's all right...

326
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,360
Tell me some stories of this world.

327
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,565
-I think I know nothing.
-All right.

328
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,225
Stories in this world are not that great.

329
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,296
The next year you were put into jail,

330
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,798
I heard from a priest that

331
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,006
you were sick in bed.

332
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,871
-In fact...
-Uhm...

333
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,077
My pain was so hard to take,

334
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,283
because I didn't know
what was up with Ae-ran.

335
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,219
The priest also told me that

336
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:11,885
your illness couldn't be healed with medicine.

337
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,527
After I heard that

338
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,599
-since then I've been looking for Ae-ran.
-What?

339
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:24,098
But if I could not find her,

340
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,872
what would be right for me to do?

341
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:34,312
-To a weak man like you...
-So?

342
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,319
It must be hard, but

343
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,521
I just wanted to save your life.

344
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,698
I started writing letters
and sent them in to you

345
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:59,399
in the name of Ae-ran
who could only heal your illness.

346
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,903
What?
Then, you did everything?

347
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,277
Yes, I did. How miserable!

348
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,119
But can't you see that

349
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,252
this fortunate misery led you

350
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,361
to become a hopeful man for 10 years?

351
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,991
Then, my Ae-ran died?

352
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,833
Huh? Ae-ran...

353
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,141
-Let's imagine that she's dead.
-What?

354
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,217
-For your future.
-What?

355
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:59,066
What can you blame in this world?

356
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,541
You should console yourself.

357
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,978
The more you can't forget her,

358
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,207
the more miserable you guys will become.

359
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,815
-Then, did she get married?
-Yes.

360
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,060
I heard that by accident.

361
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:26,822
What?

362
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,123
Moreover, she's running a cabaret.

363
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:30,791
What?

364
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,541
If I could tell a lie to you tonight,

365
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,578
I'd make you happier.

366
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,053
For 10 years,

367
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,788
I've carved this with these 10 fingers.

368
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,698
This is...

369
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,893
Would you take a seat here?

370
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,902
Bartender!

371
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,210
You just looked down on me.

372
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,515
I didn't come here to be treated.

373
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,348
You mean that you don't need me?

374
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,788
Thank you! Spread your wrinkles.
Shall we dance?

375
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:50,301
What... you're as cold as ice.
Drink it and warm yourself.

376
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,736
Tell the manageress to come here.

377
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:55,943
Yes, sir.

378
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,541
Is there any place to talk alone?

379
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,753
Wait over there.

380
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:34,940
Please take a seat.

381
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,820
I apologize for giving you this tedious treatment

382
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,981
It's been a long time.

383
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,584
Are you the manageress here?

384
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,053
Yes!

385
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,923
I'm like a disgraceful queen.

386
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,623
-Please sit.
-Yes.

387
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,292
-Mr. Kim!
-Yes?

388
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,404
Wine, please.

389
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,840
Dal-soo runs this place?

390
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,907
Let's talk about business in the office.

391
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,748
He's an old friend of mine.
Where's his house?

392
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,181
He's here now. Want to talk to him?

393
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,186
Yes.

394
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,393
Tell the boss to come over here.

395
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,467
Let's drink.

396
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:30,166
Don't you know the wife of Dal-soo?

397
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,669
You don't want to talk about another girl

398
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,439
in front of a lady.

399
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,943
It's all about feeling, isn't it?

400
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,253
-The manageress is calling you...
-Where?

401
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,917
-Over there
-I see.

402
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,221
That guy must be the man from Japan.

403
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,872
Oh, look who's here.

404
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,710
-When were you released?
-Why?

405
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,817
You thought I never came out?

406
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,517
You're good at talking now.

407
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:25,023
Excuse me.

408
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,698
Good to see you anyways.

409
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,668
I've been busy with business all alone,

410
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,504
so I couldn't go to see you.

411
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,804
I know your obvious tricks.

412
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,146
I guess you came here
to see me bearing a grudge

413
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,944
after you find out everything.

414
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,617
-Then?
-But, hey,

415
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,432
there's nothing you can do for a relationship.

416
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,033
Moreover, it's been 10 years now.

417
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,476
The relationship between you and my wife is

418
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,781
in the past.

419
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,583
Will you abandon friendship for that?

420
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,386
I don't like friends and have no friendship.

421
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,990
Hey! Let's drink anyways.

422
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,455
Excuse me.

423
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,091
I see. Stay here.

424
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,972
Drink with her here.

425
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:46,773
I have a guest.
Come to my office tomorrow.

426
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,311
I heard that you have found success.

427
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,581
Does your wife come here?

428
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,246
Don't even mention it.
She's always in hospital.

429
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:03,421
Jimmy! Take good care of him.

430
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,594
Son of bitch!

431
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,165
There's not even time
for laughter in this world.

432
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,602
-Open your mind.
-How old are you?

433
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,765
18

434
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,171
Why do you work here at your age?

435
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,475
Stop talking about boring things.

436
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,812
You could be handsome without the beard.

437
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,628
-If it's for money, I'll give it to you.
-Jimmy!

438
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,257
Excuse me for a moment.

439
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,563
I'm a guest as well.
Even you don't hate me?

440
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,897
What are you?
You're not scared?

441
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,872
You've got a nice mouth.

442
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,138
You're interesting
since you're from the school.

443
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,176
Son of...

444
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,145
Hey

445
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,341
Mind your own business
and leave him alone.

446
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,020
-What about this hall?
-It's mine.

447
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:48,458
-The guest is worth 20 million...
-Madame brought him.

448
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,832
-Will you treat him specially?
-First of all, I'll check the conditions.

449
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,267
He's secretly from Japan.

450
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,074
Okay!

451
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,311
It's a piece of cake.

452
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,972
Today you should change
the number of the car.

453
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,314
<i>Dong-il Corporation</i>

454
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:29,098
-Well...
-Oh, look who's here.

455
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,230
Long time no see.

456
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,169
It's surprising that you've come to see me.

457
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:35,839
Having fun these days?

458
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,078
-Is this first time since then?
-Yes.

459
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,580
We're going different ways,
so had no communication.

460
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,790
-Oh Gwang-pil was released.
-Yes, he was.

461
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,823
I've been waiting for him the whole night,
not knowing that he came to see you here.

462
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,900
He left earlier.

463
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,295
-Then, where did he go?
-He's changed a lot.

464
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,074
I bought drinks for him,
but he broke chairs and...

465
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:19,679
Dong-il Corporation speaking.
What? Young-saeng Hospital?

466
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,153
I'll pay the fee today.

467
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,825
-Such an ass hole!
-Who's in hospital?

468
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,122
Don't even mention it.

469
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,759
She's always in hospital,

470
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,833
so I can't handle it.

471
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,347
-I should get going.
-Why? Stay.

472
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,846
-I'm sorry for not helping you.
-It's all right.

473
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,721
What time is it now?

474
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,249
The doctor will be here soon.

475
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,389
Have some food and go.

476
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,665
I don't need a doctor now.

477
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,833
Excuse me.

478
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,103
You've got a scary illness.

479
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,005
Look in the mirror to be in front of a girl.

480
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,084
You need a comb?

481
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:36,298
It can't brush my unkempt brain.

482
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,029
Good bye.

483
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,881
-Good morning!
-Is that you, Chun-hee?

484
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:57,976
Yes.

485
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,820
-Feeling better?
-Yes

486
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,521
Why do you bring flowers
all the time? It costs a lot.

487
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,428
You don't even know my hobby.

488
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,660
-What?
-Sis!

489
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,666
When I walk on the street with flowers,

490
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,897
people might think that

491
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,975
I'm on the way to a date.

492
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:33,689
-Get a boyfriend then.
-Well, it's not that easy.

493
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,692
Last night, something bad happened.

494
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:43,297
A man came and fought
with the boss' men.

495
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:50,264
The man was just released from prison.
How pitiful!

496
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,444
-Your injury will be worse
-Please do me a favor.

497
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,877
You know Dong-il Corp. upstairs.

498
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,382
Can you let me know

499
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,821
which hospital the boss's wife is in?

500
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:09,918
Yes sir.

501
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,196
Oh, well,

502
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,038
I've been waiting for you,

503
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,540
-leaving behind everything
-Don't mention it...

504
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,404
It's humble to say,

505
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,583
but my business is very small,
as you from overseas can see.

506
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:44,393
If you two have no other questions,
let's make the contract.

507
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:51,231
-Yes, I see.
-The price is obvious.

508
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,472
Mr. Lim! Thank you for everything.

509
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,166
All right.

510
00:52:56,773 --> 00:53:00,436
-Could you come over here for a while?
-Yes.

511
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,774
You know the guy.

512
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,676
-He went out.
-I should have given him some medical fee.

513
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,354
He looked to be busy meeting someone.

514
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,116
What?

515
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:20,527
I'll take off.

516
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,463
I've got some work.
I'll see you in the evening.

517
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,899
-I'll buy the drinks tonight...
-Good.

518
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,480
The rest will be sent when the stuff is
taken over, as we promised.

519
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,958
-What time will it be?
-It should be at night.

520
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,660
I'll be waiting for you around 9 in my car.

521
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:59,531
9 o'clock? I'm coming here then.

522
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,170
You did a great job, madam.

523
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,332
All I did was introduce you guys.

524
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,795
Mom! Are you going somewhere
after combing?

525
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,658
No...

526
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,270
Then, you're not sick anymore?

527
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,848
-Did you miss mom?
-Yes

528
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,188
Tell nanny to get the sweater to put on.

529
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,023
-The weather is cold
-The red one?

530
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,056
Yes.

531
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,237
Mom! Daddy's here.

532
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,905
What're you doing here in hospital?

533
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,080
-You've got classes in the morning?
-Yes.

534
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,683
You must feel better now.

535
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,488
-You have energy to comb.
-Yes.

536
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:54,841
Gwang-pil came out. He ruined himself.

537
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,378
Such a poor guy.

538
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,527
What should I do?
I should take care of him.

539
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,756
Who will help him to eat?

540
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,199
What?

541
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,765
Why?

542
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,166
You're so mean.

543
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,246
You'll throw him into the depths of misery
just as he gets out.

544
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,375
He must be in pain.

545
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,080
He's following me to trample on me.

546
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,650
But I won't be fooled. Huh, such an idiot.

547
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,297
As long as I don't tell a secret,

548
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,635
he will never harm anyone but me.

549
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,924
Thank you for coming here.

550
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,524
-You came to see her.
-Thank you.

551
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,966
Take a seat here.

552
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,910
Didn't you get hurt last night?

553
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,282
You had me loosen up my muscles.

554
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,183
You drank too much.

555
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,719
-It must have been a hard time.
-I lived in comfort.

556
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,394
What can a man like me do anywhere?

557
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,491
Smoke.

558
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,194
-Is she your daughter?
-Yes. Eun-joo!

559
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:57,734
Say hello to him.

560
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,508
Time passes so fast.

561
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,681
How old are you?

562
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,846
-Nine.
-Oh, nine years old.

563
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:21,619
If I went out with a smart girl 10 years ago,

564
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,864
I'd have had a girl like her.

565
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,703
-I should lie down.
-Oh,

566
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,178
let me help you.

567
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:43,411
-It's too bad you're so weak.
-I'll take off.

568
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,018
Take good care of her.

569
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:51,259
-You leaving?
-Oh! Eun-joo, bye.

570
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:56,922
Here's money for your notebook
from this silly uncle.

571
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,394
-Here, take it.
-You don't need to...

572
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,400
-Come on.
-Say thank you to him

573
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,464
-Thank you.
-All right.

574
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:04,495
Such a wonderful night. Let's get drunk.

575
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,700
-What's your name?
-Lira!

576
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,304
-Lira?
-Yes

577
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:16,667
Lira... Deliver the scent of flowers to me.

578
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:27,121
-Besame besame mucho
-Bravo!

579
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,319
-You're such a beautiful woman.
-Why?

580
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,689
You comfort me as much as I feel drunk.

581
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,400
Thank you. I am grateful to you.

582
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,362
I like you so much.

583
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,135
That's what we talk about in bed.

584
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,979
That's an attractive word, very attractive.

585
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:58,079
But I need more attractive words,
more attractive wine

586
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,585
And more attractive songs
and dances. Madame!

587
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:05,519
-Shall we dance?
-Okay.

588
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,248
Stop.

589
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,431
A lover who can pray for

590
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,176
an ex-lover's happiness from a distance

591
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,380
is a possessor of real love, isn't he?

592
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,648
Leave me alone.

593
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,949
Let's go into the room.

594
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,920
It's not good if your injury gets cold.

595
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,928
If I heard that you met with a mishap,

596
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,232
I wouldn't feel good, either.

597
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,597
But I endured.

598
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,176
Only he who controls his emotions

599
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,377
can enjoy a peaceful life.

600
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,423
Let's go in from the cold.

601
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,360
Why are you so worried before big business?

602
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:02,435
-A man is irritating me.
-Oh, that guy from the jail?

603
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,242
It's simple, isn't it?

604
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:16,415
It's your choice; dump him now or later.

605
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,078
I wonder if that stubborn guy
can be cheated by Lira.

606
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,893
If he weren't,
he should go back to prison.

607
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,629
-What's your plan?
-Let's think about it.

608
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,339
-Here comes the guest with 20 million.
-Okay

609
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,443
Drink with Madame.

610
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,339
-Get him into the river!
-I see.

611
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,351
You brought this here.

612
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,553
-How come you didn't deal with it.
-All right!

613
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:06,461
If I took it out to the market,
I'd be out of money.

614
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:08,861
That's why I give you cheap stuff.

615
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,099
There's always a way out, and you're lucky.

616
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,902
You met guys like us.

617
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,439
Every day brings its bread.

618
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:52,009
-Where're we going?
-Ask the driver.

619
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,680
What?

620
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,917
Such a stupid man!
It's you who did the smuggling.

621
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,351
Let's go to the banks of the Han River

622
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,328
Sis? I'm Chun-hee.

623
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,704
But he's here now.

624
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:17,198
What?

625
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,309
He wants to know your story.

626
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:26,314
Yes, he's with Lira right now...

627
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,513
What should I do?

628
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,822
Should I go there?

629
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:48,395
A corpse from the Han River
turned out to be murdered.

630
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:53,307
Shit! Why did it come up?

631
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,378
The police are investigating the victim's lD...

632
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:07,384
Uhm...

633
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:17,799
He sneaked in on a smuggling vessel,
so they can't find his ID.

634
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,262
What would they do even if his ID were exposed?
Such shameless fellows!

635
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,638
Go and drink at Swallow.

636
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,369
I'll come with you after I go to the hospital.

637
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:30,503
Something must be wrong.
He goes to the hospital too often.

638
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,914
You're looking for Chun-hee?

639
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,122
Yes. Ask anyone, and they'll call her.

640
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,162
I see.

641
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,932
-Chun-hee?
-All right! Thank you.

642
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,949
Madame

643
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:20,284
If someone sits beside her husband,
she becomes startled.

644
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,123
How come you trusted that
kind of girl so much?

645
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,196
-What a pity!
-Madame.

646
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:29,265
What? Ah, such trouble.

647
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:32,908
All the guests are looking for me.
Excuse me.

648
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,808
-for 5 minutes, okay?
-I see.

649
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,509
Someone wants to see you now.

650
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:45,452
-Me?
-Yes, it's Ae-ran.

651
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:52,284
She can't come in here,
so she's waiting in the car.

652
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,856
I don't know her.
Tell her to leave.

653
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:30,854
Get in.

654
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,930
-I have something to say.
-Go ahead right here.

655
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,318
I'm ashamed to see you right now.

656
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,557
What's up with you?

657
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,688
-You must hate me.
-I don't want to listen.

658
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,458
What will you say?

659
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:07,993
Nothing.

660
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,603
If you had nothing to tell me,
why did you call me? Why?

661
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:13,966
Well,

662
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,345
Our stories must have all gone.

663
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:18,408
Go!

664
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,715
Don't say wicked words and go away.

665
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,181
I don't want to see you, so go.

666
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,778
-Yes, sir.
-You two,

667
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,953
live happily together.

668
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,194
I'll live, until I live,

669
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,822
-But...
- But what?

670
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:37,432
What? What?

671
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,241
-Wine!
-Whiskey?

672
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,618
She said nothing in sorrow.

673
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,358
She came like a child, but

674
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,995
went back, crying in deep grief.

675
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,235
Let's drink all night.

676
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,035
You must have felt unbearably stuffy.

677
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,478
As you're healed, let's go back home.

678
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,411
If you stay any longer,
a strange rumor will spread.

679
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,245
Right, you're right.

680
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:20,986
Take me home. Take me...

681
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,360
Though I fall down when I can't sustain

682
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,333
the pain of my body,

683
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,799
God, please help by holding my arms.

684
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,731
I pray.

685
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:51,915
I've been waiting for you.

686
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:57,257
-Why are you so late?
-I met her again today

687
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,057
I cursed her to the utmost.

688
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,769
Let's take a rest.

689
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,378
-Sang-moon!
-Yes?

690
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:16,680
-Is Ae-ran really happy?
-She must be.

691
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,421
No.

692
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,619
There must be a reason
why she'd be with Dal-soo.

693
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,752
-It's all in the past now.
-Unless...

694
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,226
And her daughter is nine years old.

695
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,035
She must be my daughter.

696
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:41,466
They've been married for 10 years.

697
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:48,409
If your guess is right,
something serious will happen.

698
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,312
What are you talking about?

699
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:56,956
Dal-soo believes that she's his daughter.

700
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,257
That's nothing to do with me.

701
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:04,498
If she were your daughter,
you should consider

702
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,896
why Ae-ran is keeping it silent.

703
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,928
And think about the kid.

704
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:14,074
And she has to be sorry for her husband.

705
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:21,080
Would he let you have the girl willingly?

706
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:23,952
If he would,

707
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,647
It would be harder for you
since you don't even have a house.

708
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,655
It's the girl who'd become unhappy
between you guys.

709
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:33,695
Stop it.

710
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,972
Don't you recognize me?
We met at the hospital the other day.

711
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:57,876
Eun-joo, your mom made this shirt for you?

712
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,681
-Yes
-I see.

713
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,323
Who do you like more, father or mother?

714
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,092
-Both.
-I see.

715
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,420
Take it and have some.

716
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:11,360
It's all right, come on!

717
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,601
-Did your daddy buy you a snack?
-Yes.

718
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:18,538
When is your birthday?

719
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,101
-October 20th
-What?

720
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,280
Come on, Eun-joo.

721
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,483
-Bye, uncle.
-Hey, Eun-joo!

722
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,705
-Keep going.
-Yes

723
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,010
I hope you can send

724
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,553
Gwang-pil far away.

725
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,323
-I, as well
-It will be appreciated.

726
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:15,620
-I told him several times, but
-I don't know how to tell you...

727
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,133
It's a big deal anyways.

728
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:24,099
He should never work
with my husband, never!

729
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:29,536
-Is he supposed to work with him?
-Yes.

730
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,210
You must be uncomfortable, take a seat.

731
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:44,190
If he tries to bother me since he hates me,

732
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:48,786
I'll go to the stake.

733
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:55,296
But that's not all.

734
01:17:56,705 --> 01:18:00,402
-Do you get it?
-I'll try my best.

735
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,278
The two friends working together now are

736
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,976
beginning a cold war.
That's all I can think.

737
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:12,179
We could have a bigger problem than that

738
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:17,051
Please tell him to leave our family alone.

739
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,349
Don't worry about it.

740
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:24,062
The thing is that
Gwang-pil's thoughts cannot

741
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:27,192
get past his boyhood age of 18.

742
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,766
As someone's wife,

743
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,506
I know it's beyond my duty, but

744
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:44,212
if Gwang-pil walks the wrong way again,

745
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,354
I won't be able to take all his sins.

746
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,054
Is there something wrong

747
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:57,630
with Dal-soo's business?

748
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:03,504
I don't know the details since he works alone.

749
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,933
Please take care of him and excuse me.

750
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:18,279
You're too weak to go out.

751
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:20,879
I'm sorry.

752
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:26,622
He was in the car all the time,
so I couldn't see him well.

753
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,062
-Detective Park!
-Yes

754
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,862
Let's take a look at these tire tracks

755
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:43,837
If the government confers orders,

756
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,606
Madame would have five of them
on your shoulder.

757
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,649
You're quite a woman.

758
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:53,177
-You always find a way out!
-Don't mention it.

759
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,582
You're just saying that since you
don't pay the tax on your words.

760
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,485
Now just give me my share.

761
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,755
I'm very hungry for money these days.

762
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,800
You know well,
as you read the newspaper.

763
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,836
I say that because I know it.

764
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,969
You'll feel relieved after
you bind me to secrecy.

765
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,441
Now you're flinching from us,
because our work's done.

766
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:20,038
If something goes wrong,
you won't be safe, either.

767
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:23,475
You must be joking.

768
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:29,454
Don't worry about me
and watch out for your wife.

769
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,285
Many people visit your cabaret these days.

770
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,390
Let's talk alone.

771
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,330
He has lots of secrets.

772
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,175
Kiss time!

773
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:58,348
Before we're exposed,
I should change some guys.

774
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,347
Right, my face might be exposed
to the police as well.

775
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:06,457
It's an stupid answer. Take care of him.

776
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,058
Who? Gwang-pil?

777
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:14,665
-He's good at it for a long time.
-What's the reward?

778
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:19,471
-As you ask.
-Then come to my bed.

779
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,618
Ah, you smell like cigarettes.

780
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,858
-Clean your lips.
-What?

781
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,327
You lips are red.

782
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:51,134
Thank you for your sincerity but

783
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,772
if you try to get Gwang-pil,

784
01:21:56,411 --> 01:22:01,439
-I will object.
-What? Why? Hey...

785
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:09,821
If I do something bad or illegal,

786
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:13,520
I wouldn't get my friend
who just got out of prison.

787
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,628
But, now you're just trying to
entrap me without reason?

788
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,731
It is your own business.

789
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:22,292
whether you do illegal things.
As long as there's some feelings,

790
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,001
how can you and Gwang-pil
work together truly,

791
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,368
since you guys have a grudge
against each other?

792
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:29,342
Did you come here to make us fight?

793
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:33,539
How come you want to
make trouble for our family?

794
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,941
Later, you might.. Go! Go away!

795
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:38,942
I said "go''!

796
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:48,056
I keep objecting to it for the happiness of
your family and Gwang-pil.

797
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,057
Shut up and go!

798
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,662
I'm sorry I made you mad. Excuse me.

799
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,437
What a bitch!

800
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:04,844
She should be quiet in hospital.

801
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,480
My sixth sense is just right.

802
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:20,050
I thought you came.
You've been here long?

803
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,756
-I came here to say good bye.
-I see.

804
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,532
I'll leave Seoul.

805
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,729
Oh! You hate Seoul so soon?

806
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,134
-Come up here.
-Yes

807
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:37,370
I thought we could become good friends,
but I'm sorry you're leaving.

808
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,141
Thank you for your consideration.

809
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:48,552
What will you do with your passion?

810
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:54,059
All I have is ashes now.

811
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:58,090
Coming to Seoul was a big loss for you.
Please sit.

812
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,028
Where are you going then?

813
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,328
I don't know.

814
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:06,273
Did Dal-soo treat you that badly?

815
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:11,808
-I never liked working with him.
-I understand.

816
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,673
I roughly guessed that too.
Thank you very much anyways.

817
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,613
You consider a girl like me, so

818
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,882
came to see me before leaving.

819
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,747
I came here to get drunk.

820
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,219
It must be hard. I know your feelings well.

821
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,560
Can alcohol fill this empty heart?

822
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,259
You should take another step.

823
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:39,235
Focus on your business or something...

824
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,673
So I plan to

825
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:48,682
open a small barber shop

826
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:52,048
after my mind is relieved.

827
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:57,957
-All I learned is haircutting.
-Though you do that,

828
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:00,687
they will laugh at you in life.

829
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,856
What should I do with my bad fate?

830
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,231
If I were you, whatever I did,

831
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,201
I would live better before them.

832
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,666
Why are you retreating like a fool?

833
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:16,801
Stop it. I've been thinking about everything.

834
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:25,815
I also feel furious to see you that frustrated.

835
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,151
I'll take care of you.

836
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,894
I'll introduce all the stuff to you

837
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:36,020
that Dong-il Corp. has dealt with

838
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,093
I'm an introducer of it.

839
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:44,429
I can guarantee good deals all the time.

840
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:49,836
One condition though...

841
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,511
You need particular passion to work with me.

842
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:01,649
You should enjoy adventure.

843
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,885
What do you think of my suggestion?

844
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,428
You didn't do it?

845
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:13,625
The father came and told me what he knows.

846
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:17,427
-That's what you told him, isn't it?
-Well, you misunderstood something.

847
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,504
-The reason I went to see the father...
-Misunderstanding?

848
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:27,943
-Then what?
-As for Gwang-pil...

849
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,914
-That's all, honey.
-What?

850
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:37,089
Don't be so upset, and listen to me.

851
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:38,954
Tell me! It will be your will.

852
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:44,625
I don't know why you hate
Gwang-pil that much.

853
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:49,499
-You feel sorry for him?
-He's such a poor guy.

854
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,368
He's got no one around him.

855
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:56,210
Why are you trying to send him
back to jail again for nothing?

856
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:59,244
What? What did you just say?

857
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:04,181
If someone is guilty,
I'm the one who committed a big sin.

858
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,214
Please consider my situation.

859
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,891
If you feel pitiful
and as if you sinned against him,

860
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:12,892
go and live with him, huh?

861
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,828
Such a wicked woman.

862
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:20,626
You went to Sang-moon to tell my secret

863
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:23,396
because you wanted to live with him
after you got me into jail.

864
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,698
You did, huh? You dirty...

865
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,640
You're not sleepy?

866
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,872
I had a friend called Pig.

867
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:13,044
He had 5 previous convictions,
but he knew the world.

868
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:15,849
Why do you reflect on cold memories?

869
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,257
He would tell the same thing to me.

870
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,829
-You're not sleepy, he said.
-So?

871
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,894
He asked me if I wasn't sleepy.

872
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:31,967
I won't sleep until you fall asleep.

873
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,006
That guy told me that
I'd meet him again in jail soon.

874
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:39,639
His guess was so right.

875
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,337
To the father...

876
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:13,913
I've got something to tell Sang-moon,

877
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,652
so call Sang-moon and tell him to come over.

878
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,284
Where would he be now?

879
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:31,424
I'll make an injection in 30 minutes.

880
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:34,363
Sis

881
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,133
Doctor!

882
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,868
Please tell me...

883
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:50,449
I'll do my best, but take good care of her.

884
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:54,715
The condition is up to the patient.

885
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:10,297
It's already the time.
We'll be there around 4.

886
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:14,933
Though I live in Seoul,
I just heard of Incheon.

887
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:18,210
-It's my first time to go to Incheon.
-You do?

888
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,340
Then, I'll be your guide.

889
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:27,554
Have you bought stuff in Incheon until now?

890
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:29,817
My route is from everywhere.

891
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,989
As you will see today,

892
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:35,353
the stuff from Incheon is the best.

893
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:39,129
There're lots of ships there.

894
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:48,237
Incheon? He went to Incheon, I see.

895
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:54,246
There's no certain information...

896
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,940
When you get it, come back to the office.

897
01:30:57,418 --> 01:31:00,683
I'll contact the police in Incheon.

898
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:06,149
What about complicity? As we guessed...

899
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:11,825
Yes yes Okay!

900
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,092
<i>Owing to the confession of the criminal,</i>

901
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,531
<i>the mythical two opposite alibis</i>

902
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,234
<i>turned to dust. The next news is</i>...

903
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:24,676
<i>According to the authorities,</i>
<i>this morning around 1 1,</i>

904
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:28,609
<i>the ID of the victim of</i>

905
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,683
<i>the Han River case became clear</i>.

906
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:33,787
<i>The authorities announced optimistically that</i>

907
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:37,085
<i>arresting the perpetrator will be</i>
<i>just a matter of time. Next is</i>...

908
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:43,860
How mysterious!
How would they know?

909
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:05,942
Is it Swallow?
Call the manageress. She went out?

910
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:12,017
Shit! I had a bad dream.

911
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,630
Why are you so scared?

912
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,469
-You've got a big body.
-Huh!

913
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,828
Though they know his ID,

914
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,571
they wouldn't know what he's done

915
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:30,506
since he came from Japan alone

916
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:32,407
and got murdered in secret.

917
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,276
Excuse me.

918
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,824
I thought he's in.

919
01:32:46,627 --> 01:32:48,595
-Who are you looking for?
-The boss...

920
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:51,058
-He's not in right now.
-Oh, I see.

921
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,825
Why do you keep coming?

922
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,234
Did he go out with a guy?

923
01:32:57,338 --> 01:33:00,034
-Not at all!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

924
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,793
He's come here for something special.

925
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:25,260
-He's acting strangely.
-He must have overheard something.

926
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,133
Right, watch your mouth.

927
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,369
Shall we kill him?

928
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,299
Why do you let him in to the office?

929
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,936
Is there a traitor in here?

930
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:40,578
-Are you?
-No way!

931
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,376
-You?
-Bro, what're you doing?

932
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:43,711
Son of...

933
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:50,648
Speaking aloud over a microphone,
you think this is an outdoor market?

934
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:56,320
Did you hear the radio?
The father came again.

935
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:57,790
I met him.

936
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:30,159
Come here!

937
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:32,596
Hurry!

938
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:38,035
Never worry! But just in case...

939
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,403
it will be safer if we move the stuff
in the warehouse to somewhere else.

940
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,904
-Right now!
-That's right.

941
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:47,244
I'll go out to check.

942
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:50,749
The father is the only dangerous one

943
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,183
since he knows our secret.

944
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,821
If I accede to his demand,

945
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:57,423
he will inform the police about us for sure.

946
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,084
-Let's get rid of him.
-All right.

947
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:04,327
Get him.
He will be in the hospital or church.

948
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,769
It was Dal-soo who forced me,
this weak girl,

949
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:12,402
who was waiting for Gwang-pil.

950
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:20,805
I swear that I should bring my life to the man

951
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:27,411
who made me not wait for Gwang-pil.

952
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:34,719
My husband always told me that I live with him

953
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:40,160
because I am getting revenge on him.

954
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:45,067
Am I really that kind of girl?

955
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,411
I don't even know that.

956
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,971
While I live with him,

957
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:58,078
I found myself feeling attractive
to my family so soon

958
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:03,188
as if I had become crazy.

959
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:08,761
That's what a woman is like.

960
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:10,953
As I heard from you,

961
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:18,102
I regret myself that regretted you once.

962
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,967
I thought he'd forget me as time passed.

963
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,412
That's what I thought.

964
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:32,242
But his eyes are the same as
they were 10 years ago.

965
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,190
He will definitely

966
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:45,460
do something.

967
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:56,565
Because I know him better than
anyone else, I can't sleep.

968
01:36:58,245 --> 01:36:59,177
Chun-hee!

969
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:07,786
Open the bag and find the picture in which
he got rid of a pain in my eyes a long time ago.

970
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:13,086
You can find the picture.

971
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:18,092
If he sees it, he will know my mind.

972
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,408
-Call her family.
-Okay.

973
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:37,475
It's hard for her to go through tonight.

974
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:51,521
-I'll call them.
-Okay

975
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:58,461
Father! Call him right now.

976
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:00,630
She must be so frustrated that

977
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:04,474
-she cried hard.
-I see.

978
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:09,505
-How are you?
-Oh, hello.

979
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,846
-Then, please...
-I see.

980
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:16,513
I saw your car, so I was going to meet you.

981
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,080
-Me?
-Yes.

982
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:23,393
My boss wants to talk about your friend.

983
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:26,198
I see.

984
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:30,031
Is Gwang-pil there now?

985
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:32,937
-Yes.
-Is he?

986
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:37,836
-Please get in if you are going there with me.
-Thank you. I'm sorry.

987
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:05,538
Boss!

988
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:09,740
Boss!

989
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:17,782
Boss!

990
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:30,962
What is it?

991
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,581
-Can I see your ID?
-Here.

992
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,712
Excuse me.

993
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:57,522
I'm sorry but please follow me
to the police station.

994
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:03,457
-Yes, ok. In fact...
-Did you plan to meet the boss here?

995
01:40:06,066 --> 01:40:09,058
Who knows where he is?

996
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:12,871
He made me come here
and ran away by himself.

997
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:14,802
Such an ass hole.

998
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:19,705
-Sir, I didn't do anything...
-Shut up!

999
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:23,109
If you're that resentful,
I'll let you meet him soon.

1000
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:26,987
Lee!

1001
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,392
Gwang-pil, that brat!

1002
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:49,107
He thought I'd get caught as he wishes.

1003
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:52,539
I'm Chief Detective Chung.

1004
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:55,777
Hey, detective Lee!

1005
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,845
That's all I know.

1006
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,916
-You'll know better after investigating.
-I see.

1007
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:11,926
You aren't even leading him
onto the right path,

1008
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:13,458
Is this Miss Kim?

1009
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:16,627
but using his weakness,
you tried to use him?

1010
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:21,597
-Your voice is nice, huh?
-Stop the private calls!

1011
01:41:24,445 --> 01:41:28,939
You just came out of the prison 5 days ago.

1012
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:34,112
How come you're caught in a trap?

1013
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:43,923
Huh? You spiritless fellow.
Detective Kim, take him to jail.

1014
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:08,518
I can see you have no direct relationship
with this case, but

1015
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,279
in your psychology,

1016
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:11,756
you've planned to commit a crime already.

1017
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:23,400
-Gwang-pil!
-Sit down!

1018
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,032
What are you doing here?

1019
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:30,302
Examine yourself there for days and months.

1020
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:33,976
-What about the gang?
-We're in pursuit.

1021
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:34,911
Wait!

1022
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:42,388
-It could be a rude request, but...
-What is it?

1023
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:45,582
There's a patient who's going to die
and leave her will to Gwang-pil.

1024
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,523
I was asked to call him but I was taken to

1025
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:53,960
-the police station on the way.
-You were?

1026
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:54,893
Yes

1027
01:42:57,337 --> 01:42:58,429
-Detective Kim!
-Yes!

1028
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:03,608
Get Oho Gwang-pil released temporarily.
Give me your stuff.

1029
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:09,504
Since we'll investigate him later,

1030
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,050
please give him security.

1031
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:13,210
Of course.

1032
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:22,192
You should know better
after 10 years in the school.

1033
01:43:27,134 --> 01:43:32,436
Ae-ran has fought her pain
and her unfortunate destiny for half her lifetime.

1034
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:48,951
Taxi!

1035
01:43:53,827 --> 01:43:54,725
Gwang-pil!

1036
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,400
You're late.

1037
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,379
-She's gone to the morgue.
-What?

1038
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:30,158
Want to see her for the last time?

1039
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,334
Follow me.

1040
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:52,649
Gwang-pil! Gwang-pil!

1041
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:26,148
I know your feelings, that

1042
01:45:27,954 --> 01:45:32,721
you informed the police
against me to keep Ae-ran.

1043
01:48:58,565 --> 01:48:59,827
Ae-ran
