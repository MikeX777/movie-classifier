back in 1935.

It was hotter,
for one thing,

00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:21,021
and we didn't have
TV neither.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,540
Nobody had
discovered them yet.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,991
My mamma and daddy
lost about everything,

6
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,855
but we didn't give up.

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,374
No, sir.

8
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:32,308
That's the way
we were brought up, I guess.

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,206
The way we figured it,

10
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:37,865
if we hung on and gave it
everything we got,

11
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:39,660
things would get better.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,180
And we were wrong
about that,

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,804
but so were a lot
of people back then.

14
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:48,220
I'll never forget
those days--

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,258
how wonderful it was
to be alive,

didn't have a chance.

everything,

19
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:00,750
but they weren't the ones
that built the business.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,201
They just grabbed
the apples.

21
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,927
And that's what
they were--grabbers.

22
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,930
It was the catters
that made the business--

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,967

Good morning,

I haven't had
the pleasure.

something

to look
forward to,
won't it?

you're an oilman.

leave it to

a study of it?

I want you ladies
to come with me.

Now get down
on your knees.

Get down.
Here we go.

Now put your ear
down on the ground.

See?

409
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,619
There.

See?
You can hear it.

414
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,530
Sounds like sea shells.

a secret admiration

look like

00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,458
about 10,
maybe 12 years ago,

00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,494
I worked on a well
in south Texas.

Now, there's a lot
of oil down there,

you're looking for.

of it right here.

I know so.
I knew the first day
that I got here.

That's probably
quite a shock,

you being a farmer
and all.

the richest men in Texas.

and a house back there

in Florida or Europe
or somewhere,

506

I couldn't do that
to you.

00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,856
Do what?

out of your pocket
like that.

is--is--is 50-50.

I got a pretty good feeling
what my 50 is.

What's your 50?

under the most adverse
conditions you can imagine.

I know it all.

528
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:46,285

that expertise on the line,

less than 5,000 here.

We'll make millions.

533

$5,000?

534
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,232
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,894
I know that's
a lot of money to you,

536
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:12,863
but you have neighbors,
and they look up to you and Don.

537
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:15,245
Now, hear me.
It's coming to me.

538
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:18,593
We could go to them
as partners, together.

539
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:22,631
Cut US a pretty
respectable deal.

540
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:25,393
I want to tell you
something, Mr. Cox.

541
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:27,222
The truth is,

542
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:30,639
you look
more like a hobo
than any oilman.

543
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,952
That's all right.
No harm in that.

544
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:35,644
Maybe we ain't
much better off
ourselves,

545
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:39,165
but you think
I'd get my neighbors
involved in this?

546
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,512
I think you better go,
Mr. Cox.

547
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,998
This would be good
for everybody, Mr. Day.

548

Not just me--
your neighbors,

your children--

551
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:52,144
It really would.

552
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,294
[Door banging]

553
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,851
Well...I'll just
get my things,

554
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:13,165
if you don't mind,
and I'll be on my way.

555
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:21,518

556
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:24,348
Wish I had
$5,000.

557
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,765
Crazy man.

558
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,418
[Ding]

559
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:01,420
Yes, sir?
Can I help you?

560
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,561
I'm looking
for Norman sward's
room number, please.

561
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:06,770
No, no sward here.

562
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,599
No sward.

563
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,394
Well, how about
Cedric hartman?

564
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,258
No. No, sir.

565
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:13,812
And, uh, let's see...

566
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:16,262
P.g. Pratt?

567
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:17,712
Yes, sir. Mr. Pratt.

568
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:20,266
But I believe he
said he was going--

569
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,751
well, there he is
right there, sir.

570
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:28,757
P.g.! Good
to see you, sir.
How you been?

571
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:31,105
Mr. Cox?
I'll be damned!

572
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:34,108
Alex, come here.
I want you to
meet somebody.

573
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,109
Hey.

574
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:37,594
Alex is from Yale,
but he's o.K.

575
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,113
Ha ha ha!

576
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,115
Why, hell,
I haven't seen you

577
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,463
since old Mac Holland
got after you with a gun

578
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,085
right after that
Derrick collapsed.

579
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:47,431
That wasn't
my fault.

580
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,088
That was that
Mexican boy.

581
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,643
Whoa, now. I remember
you was telling me that.

582
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,301
You staying here
at the hotel, Mr. Cox?

583
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,614
Actually, p.G.,
I'm working
on a deal

584
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:01,307
to get set up
out there in, you know,
Wichita county.

585
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:04,724
Now, it's about
2,100 foot down,
maybe 22.

586
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:08,418
We can get to it
for 12,000
if we go rotary.

587
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,696
We could go cable,
but rotary's better.

588
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,732
I assume
you've tested?

589
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:15,149
I have evidence
to believe there's oil,

590
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,358
if that's what
you mean.

591
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:20,361
This thing's
sitting on top of
a salt formation

592
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,294
just like spindletop.

593
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:23,916
Spindletop.

594
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,264
Yeah. You've heard
of spindletop, I hope.

595
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:30,923
There were salt formations
at Rochester and sweet pie.

596
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,407
I never heard of them.

597
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:35,859
I'm not surprised.
There wasn't any oil there.

598
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,412
Oh, I see.

599
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,518
Now, we're all
on the same side.

600
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:43,315
Look, p.G.,
I got nothing against
your Yale boy here,

601
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:46,352
but I'm handing you
the chance of a lifetime.

602
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:48,285
I know it's there.

603
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,323
Nobody knows
where there's oil.

604
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:53,428
Is that right,
college boy?

605
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:57,053
Well...i know.
Yeah. I know.

606
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,088
Really?

607
00:31:58,088 --> 00:31:59,262
Yeah.

608
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:01,609
How is it
you know so much?

609
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,714
You got
a geologist's report?

610
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,647
Soil samples?
Anything at all?

611
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:08,064
Well...i been there,
I seen it,

612
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:10,100
I heard it,
I smelled it,

613
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,345
and so did Matilda,
and that's a damn fact.

614
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:14,760
Ma--

615
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,487
yeah.

616
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:21,387
This is the real thing.

617
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:25,115
I mean, it nearly
knocked me on the ground,
my friend.

618
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:27,221
We better go.
Jessie's waiting.

619
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,948
Mr. Cox,
it's been nice
chatting with you.

620
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,294
It's always
a pleasure

621
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:33,606
to see somebody
from the old days.

622
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:35,263
Now...

623
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,478
[Mr. Cox]
Mrs. Pickens, I'll give you
the opportunity to get in

624
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:44,997
while there's still room.

625
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:49,312
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I can understand.

626
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:52,142
Well...I'm sorry
to hear that,

627
00:32:52,142 --> 00:32:54,973
but if that's
the way you feel.

628
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,147
Yeah. Well,
you got--all right.

629
00:32:57,147 --> 00:33:00,323
Good-bye and god bless.

630
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:02,635
Maybe another time.

631
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,810

mother earth.

636

In that ground--
what's in the ground?

637
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:28,592
What do we have in the ground?

638
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,662
Oil.

639
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:33,149

some of that later.

something later.

with coffee...

654

was some.

00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:02,914
What you been
hiding here?
Looky here.

901
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:04,605
That Zeke...

902
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:07,954
He sure know
how to dress.

903
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,060
[Music and laughter]

904
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:17,342
What can we
do you for, sport?

905
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:19,689
I'm just waiting
on a friend.

906
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,382
Come on.
You go sit down
over here

907
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:23,831
with these other
fellows.

908
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:24,971
Where?

909
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:26,834
Right over here.
That's right.

910
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,322
Y'all
have fun, now.

911
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,498
Hi, honey!

912
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:37,017
Follow me.

913
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,674
Lead on,
my lady.

914
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:42,298
All right, ladies.

915
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:45,370
Let's go downstairs
for payday!

916
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,200
Yeah! Round 'em up!

917
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,822
Round 'em up!
Cross that river.

918
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:50,479
A big-spending guy
like me

919
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:52,446
might have something
special here.

920
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:55,035
Ooh!ohh!

921
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,899
Come here. Right this way.

922
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:59,867
Let's see who's going to
get this little diamond.

923
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:05,528
Who's going to be
the lucky girl?

924
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:06,840
Me!me!

925
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,876
Who wants it?

926
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,533
Yes!

927
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,091
Do I know you?

928
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:20,060
No, but i'm
going to know you.

929
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,167
[Woman]
Whoo! Where'd you get
the duds?

930
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:25,307
Vaudeville?

931
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,585
Ha ha ha!

932
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:30,933
Keep that one.
She's a real card.
Ha ha ha!

933
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:37,146
No, uh...Old Mac,
Mac Holland, told me
to look you up.

934
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:40,425
Fine. Well, tell Mac
that big Dave says hello.

935
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:43,083
Say, Dave, I just
had a good one.

936
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,327
How about you and me
going someplace

937
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:47,018
and tossing down
a few?

938
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,778
No, I don't think so.

939
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:52,817
Mac made me swear
I'd treat you
to the town.

940
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:55,785
Well, I'm not much
of a drinking man,

941
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:59,479
but, uh...I have worked up
a bit of an appetite.

942
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:03,276
Sure, Dave.
You name the place.

943
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:06,762
I took you for
a steak man, Dave.

944
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:08,557
What do you
think, ed?

945
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:10,076
Oh, he doesn't think.

946
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:11,629
Must be a democrat!

947
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:13,976
You're not a democrat,
are you, Dave?

948
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:17,255
I can't say much
for the looks
of this place.

949
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:18,256
You been here?

950
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:20,914
No, but I heard
some gal almost died

951
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:22,536
from something
in her food here.

952
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:27,472
Mr. Cox!
Pleasure to see you.

953
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:30,303
Don't say nothing.
Shut up.

954
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:32,615
Hey, p.G.
How are you, sir?

955
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:33,961
Good to see you, sir.

956
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:39,967
No...i don't know.
I think that gal
did die.

957
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:42,315
Matter of fact,
I'm sure of it.

958
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:44,110
Well, good evening,
Mr. Cox.

959
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:49,149
Who the hell
is that?

960
00:50:52,773 --> 00:50:55,431
The boys in Detroit
don't got
this problem.

961
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,089
The country thinks
Henry Ford
is a Saint.

962
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,332
Why? Boosting.

963
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:01,334
They can call it
public relations

964
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:02,852
or modern
advertising,

965
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,820
but it's plain,
old-fashioned
boosting.

966
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,477
That's it
in a nutshell.

967
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:07,995
That really is.

968
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:11,309
You can believe me
on that one.

969
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,144
[Mr. Cox]
Here's to luck,
queen of destiny,

970
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:19,662
and hail to oil.

971
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:21,526
Oh, my god.

972
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:24,046
I'll lay my cards
on the table.

973
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:26,807
I'd hoped to
stay away
from business,

974
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:28,292
but I've been
impressed

975
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:30,811
by the way we've
hit it off.

976
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:33,849
You know who's out there?

977
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,058
Big Dave mcdermit.

978
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:39,026
I'll bet he's
the richest man
in Texas.

979
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:40,649
Oh, do tell.

980
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:43,307
I think you
just might be
interested here.

981
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:45,654
I think.

982
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:47,690
Ha ha ha!

983
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,042
Did I say
something wrong,
Dave?

984
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,630
What did I say?

985
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:03,085
You're a hopeless
loser, Mr. Cox.

986
00:52:03,085 --> 00:52:07,054
I just don't have time
for losers.

987
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:14,372
You say hello to Mac
for me now, you hear?

988
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,790
Mr. Mcdermit, let me
introduce myself.

989
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,413
I own this restaurant.

990
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:21,897
Well, good for you!

991
00:52:21,897 --> 00:52:23,554
Ha ha ha!

992
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,393
I gave you a job
washing dishes,

993
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:37,706
but that ain't
good enough for you.

994
00:52:42,435 --> 00:52:45,714
$13.50.

995
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:49,614
Got the money
for that...Oilman?

996
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:52,617
Take it out of
the money you owe me.

997
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:56,138
You ain't getting a nickel
out of me after this stunt.

998
00:52:56,138 --> 00:52:57,622
I got a few
dollars.

999
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:02,179
All I want you to do
is go and phone the police.

1000
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:07,287
Oh, I'll talk to you later.

1001
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:10,014
Shirl, you call them!

1002
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:20,058
So...this is
the way it is, huh?

[Glass shatters]

1004
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:32,001
Oilman, huh?
You ain't nothing
but a cheap promoter!

1005
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,383
Can't even
wash dishes decent.

1006
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:36,558
I'm calling
the police!

1007
00:53:36,558 --> 00:53:37,559
Crazy.

1008
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:43,737
Hey, this is
Larry ligstow.
Get me the police.

1009
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:56,163
How much love or money
are you asking?

1010
00:53:56,163 --> 00:53:59,166
Well, I can't
sell her to you.

1011
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,685
No, no, sir.

1012
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:03,585
She's got too much
sentimental value
for that...

1013
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:05,725
But I might
lease her to you.

1014
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:07,105
Lease?

1015
00:54:07,105 --> 00:54:08,624
Well...

1016
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,178
Say, $300 now
and $100
by the week.

1017
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:12,732
Well...ha ha ha!

1018
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,251
You've lost your mind.

1019
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,426
That wouldn't
leave me enough
for pipe or timber.

1020
00:54:17,426 --> 00:54:18,945
You couldn't get

twice that.

Now, don't take me
for ignorant.

1024
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,987
I don't like that.

1025
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:31,475
Yeah.

1026
00:54:31,475 --> 00:54:32,717
I tell you what,
boy.

1027
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,514
I'll throw in
some timber
and three men

1028
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,723
to help you
put up a Derrick.

1029
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:41,450
I'll tell you what.

1030
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,936
I just might be willing
to let you in

1031

for a percentage.

1032
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:49,493
I told you before.

1039

Yes, sir.

and on weekends.

I'll be seeing you
for a while.

miss me, did you?

1076
00:57:51,157 --> 00:57:54,229
I didn't miss you any.
Yeah.

1077
00:57:57,025 --> 00:57:59,027
This is it, darling.

1078
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:03,031
I got to take care
of some business, all right?

1079
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:05,033
Now, if I don't
come back,

1080
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,035
I want you to hook up

1081
00:58:07,035 --> 00:58:09,486
with one of these roughnecks,
all right?

1082
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:13,662
They'll take care of you.
They're good men.

1083
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:16,631
But you got to behave yourself,
all right?

1084
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:20,669
Give me
a little kiss, o.K.?

1085

[Purring]

1086
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:25,156
Yeah, good girl.

1087
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:26,675
Yeah.

1088
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:28,125
[Meow]

1089
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,027
That's the way
it's got to be.

1090
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:36,098
That's the way
it's got to be.

1091
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:27,218
It sure beats
the hell out of me.

1092
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:31,740
Everything seems
to be running
smooth.

1093
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,742
Well, it ain't
going nowhere.

1094
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:35,744
Just stopped.

1095
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,746
Well, it got me
whupped.

1096
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,749
How deep did you
say we was?

1097
00:59:40,749 --> 00:59:44,235
I don't know.
Maybe 1,300 feet.

1098
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,618
1,300?

1099
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:49,275
Yeah. So what?

1100
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:52,243
Well, what the hell
you trying to do?

1101
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:53,451
I told you before

1102
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:55,488
this rig wasn't
built to go

1103
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,801
more than
1,200 feet,
you damn fool!

1104
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:00,631
The deal is off!
I want my rig back!

1105
01:00:03,427 --> 01:00:05,912
You never said
nothing about
no 1,200 feet!

1106
01:00:05,912 --> 01:00:07,914
Oh, the heck I didn't!

1107
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,261
That's what comes
when you deal
with ignorance!

1108
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,438
And don't you
touch that rig

1109
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:17,268
till I bring
my boys over
to bring it home!

Thank you, sir.

Good day, sir.

1114
01:00:38,945 --> 01:00:40,429
Good day.

1115
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:41,948
How can I help you?

1116
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:43,432
I'd like a room,
please.

1117
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,434
O.k. I've met
all kinds,

1118

mister...

1119

Not Duke,
not lord,

1120
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,476
just plain old
Mr. Cox.

1121
01:00:52,476 --> 01:00:56,963
Well, Mr. Cox,
you'll be staying
in room 216.

1122
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:58,447
[Ding ding]

1123
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:01,968
Ha ha ha!

1124
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:05,489
Take Mr. Cox
to room 216.

1125
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:08,699
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your stay.

1126
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:09,976
For you.

1127
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:11,288
Thank you.

1132
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:21,470
O.k., darling.

1133
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,474
There you go.

1134
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,442
Wait a minute.

1135

[Knock on door]

1136
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,492
Cora?

1137
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:50,983
Cora.

1138
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,025
What I did was stupid.

1139
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:04,859
It was...

1140
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:08,517
It was so stupid.

1141
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:20,219
Maybe I thought
I'd do something

1142
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,876
even your Lee
couldn't do.

1143
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:23,325
I don't know.

1144
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:26,673
We got till the 1st
to pay this note...

1145
01:02:31,057 --> 01:02:33,922
And I don't know
what to do about it.

1146
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,964
I'm going to talk
to the bank.

1147
01:02:40,964 --> 01:02:43,552
Maybe they'll give US
an extension.

1148
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:46,038
Stop saying US.

1149
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:58,050

Don, it would be

1152
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:15,826
against
state banking laws.

1153
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:19,105
We're not talking
about a lot of time here,

1154
01:03:19,105 --> 01:03:20,589
just a couple
of months.

1155
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:25,456
Well, I don't see
how you'd be
better off then.

1156
01:03:27,113 --> 01:03:30,461
I'm not just
asking for me.

[Telephone ringing]

1158
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,466
Well, I can't live
Cora's life for her.

1159
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,608
I'm just glad
Lee isn't alive

1160
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,748
to see
what's happened
to his farm.

1161
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,925
Why, it would break
that poor man's
heart

1162
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:47,962
to have Cora lose
that land.

1163
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,518
Lee was a friend
of mine, Don.

1164

He wasn't
no daydreamer
like you.

No.

talking about.

good news.

1232
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:12,502
It appears that I have been
successful

1233

in interesting a number
of moneyed investors

1234
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,508
in the oil venture
we discussed at your farm.

1235
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:21,027
As yet, I've been
only able to raise

1236
01:08:21,027 --> 01:08:23,029
a portion
of the necessary capital,

1237
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:25,515
though I expect
to have acquired the remainder

1238

or weeks at most.

01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:28,750
Hold it!

1253
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,821
[Glass shatters]

1254
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,098
[Woman screams]

1255
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:34,100
Aah!

1256
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,792
[Man]
Stay down.

1257
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:38,001
Operator!

1258
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:39,830
Ow!

1259
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,316
Jeez!

1260
01:09:42,316 --> 01:09:43,731
Drop it!

1261
01:09:45,836 --> 01:09:47,044
Here.

1262
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,537
[Grunting]

1263
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:06,236
Aargh! Aah!

1264
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:08,134
Ohh! Aah!

1265
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:10,999
Come on!

1266
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,967
[Groaning]

1267
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:14,417
They're on
the second floor!

1268
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:15,694
We'll take care of it.

1269
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:21,147
[Groan]

1270
01:10:22,183 --> 01:10:23,460
Hello?

1271
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:35,990
Check
the street!

1272
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,992
I'll cover
the lobby!

1273
01:10:37,992 --> 01:10:39,683
[Big Dave]
I want him found.

1274
01:10:39,683 --> 01:10:41,202
You hear me?
Find him!

1275
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,342
I want every room
in this hotel
checked!

1276
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:45,344
I want this whole
damn town

1277
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:46,863
turned
right upside down!

1278
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:49,624
This is no time
to dillydally!

1279
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:50,936
Aah!

1280
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,634
Let's go.

1281
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:01,153
[Meow]

1282
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:03,328
This is no time
to dillydally.

1283
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:04,812
Come on. Yeah.

1284
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:41,193
Hello!

1285
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:44,196
Mr. Day!

1286
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:46,198
Mr. Don day!

1287
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:48,200
Good morning.

1288
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,276
Hello!

1289
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,735
Mr. Day!

1290
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:07,702
Mr. Don day!

1291
01:12:10,222 --> 01:12:11,672
It's me! I'm back!

1292
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:18,955
What the hell
do you want?

1293
01:12:18,955 --> 01:12:20,715
I want to talk to you!

1294
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:27,757
Why don't you
just go on about
your business?

1295
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:30,242
No. I've been
traveling all night.

1296
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:32,658
I just want to talk,
that's all.

1297
01:12:32,658 --> 01:12:34,660
Well, if it's
the oil

1298
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,179
you're
interested in,

1299
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:38,319
you can just wait
till the 1st.

1300
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:40,045
Talk to the bank
about it.

1301
01:12:40,045 --> 01:12:43,013
It ain't got
nothing to do
with me no more.

1302
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:45,050
Mr. Day, listen to me.

1303
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,914
When I was out here
before,

1304
01:12:46,914 --> 01:12:49,088
I said I wanted you
as a partner.

1305
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:52,954
That wasn't no stunt
I was pulling. I meant it.

1306
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:54,473
Now...

1307
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:56,958
Oh, did you ever read
my letter?

1308
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,615
Did you get my letter?

1309
01:13:00,445 --> 01:13:02,688
I read your letter,
Mr. Cox.

1310
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:04,207
Oh, ma'am. Yeah.

1311
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:07,106
Then you know
I'm telling you the truth.

1312
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:09,074
[Cox]
I wouldn't lie to you.

1313
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,076
Now, listen to me.
Listen.

1314
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:14,079
I make my living
from the ground.

1315
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,564
Now, this is
a gold mine

1316
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:19,291
we're standing
on here, lady.

1317
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,810
I know it,

1318
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,984
and I think your husband
knows it.

1319
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:25,642
Now, I can get to it,
Mrs. Day.

1320
01:13:25,642 --> 01:13:27,817
I got the money.
I got the expertise.

1321
01:13:27,817 --> 01:13:30,613
Somebody is going to
get to it someday,

1322
01:13:30,613 --> 01:13:32,753
and I want it
to be US.

1323
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:37,343
Now, think about it.

1324
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:40,312
You have your children,
your house, your land.

1325
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:42,866
Don't let this
all go to waste.

1326
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:48,424
Do you hear me?
Does somebody hear me?

1327
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:53,014
It's not
my decision,
Mr. Cox.

1328
01:13:53,014 --> 01:13:55,361
It's up
to my husband.

1329
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,918
Oh, mamma!

1330
01:14:15,002 --> 01:14:16,590
[Cora]
Beatrice?

1331
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,488
Honey?

1332
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:22,527
Make him leave.

1333
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:24,529
Don't let him
stay here.

1334
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:26,531
Who--Mr. Cox?

1335
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:29,534
It's his fault Raymond's
in the hospital.

1336
01:14:29,534 --> 01:14:31,018
If he hadn't come here

1337
01:14:31,018 --> 01:14:32,537
in the first place,

1338
01:14:32,537 --> 01:14:35,056
none of this would have
ever happened.

1339
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:37,058
The reason
Raymond's in the hospital

1340
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:40,061
is because
he fell off
the Derrick.

1341
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:42,547
He was trying
to help pauline.

1342
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:44,549
That's right.

1343
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:46,551
He fell off
the Derrick

1344
01:14:46,551 --> 01:14:49,070
trying to help
somebody in trouble.

1345
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,556
It's just
the way he is.

1346
01:14:51,556 --> 01:14:54,075
He'll probably
always be that way.

1347
01:14:54,075 --> 01:14:57,527
You can't blame
Mr. Cox for that.

1348
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,258
Let me ask you
something.

1349
01:15:04,258 --> 01:15:05,742
[Groan]

1350
01:15:07,261 --> 01:15:10,057
Why did you
decide to drill
where you did?

1351
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:11,576
Huh?

1352
01:15:11,576 --> 01:15:13,578
A hunch? A feeling?

1353
01:15:13,578 --> 01:15:15,614
Yeah, yeah,
a feeling.

1354
01:15:15,614 --> 01:15:18,583
All right, now,
where did you have
this feeling?

1355
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,101
Where?

1356
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:22,587
Yeah. You got to be
exact about this.

1357
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:25,106
Was it here?
Did you feel it--
what?

1358
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:27,246
Here or here?
In there? Here?
Right there.

1359
01:15:27,246 --> 01:15:28,593
That's right.

1360
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,766
Right there.

1361
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:31,250
That's it.
That's exactly right.

1362
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,769
How did you know?

1363
01:15:32,769 --> 01:15:34,944
That's exactly
what I thought.

1364
01:15:34,944 --> 01:15:36,946
Ha ha! Yeah.

1365
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:40,466
So what the hell's wrong?
I said I felt it.

1366
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:42,572
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
It's o.K.

1367
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:46,611
What are you doing?

1368
01:15:46,611 --> 01:15:48,095
Oh...

1369
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,131
Little trade secret.

1370
01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:52,720
Something I devised
called "oil to oil."

1371
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,378
Oil to oil.

1372
01:15:55,378 --> 01:15:57,518
All right, now,
let's get to it.

1373
01:15:57,518 --> 01:15:59,002
Out of the way,
kitty.

1374
01:15:59,002 --> 01:16:00,521
Ha ha ha!

1375
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:03,041
You're not an oilman,
are you, Don?

1376
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,043
I never said I was.

1377
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:06,527
That's right.
That's right.

1378
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,046
You never did,
did you?

1379
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:11,532
How about letting
an oilman teach you
something?

1380
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:14,949
When you feel it here,
that is zinc.

1381
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:16,951
When you feel it here,

1382
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:19,091
that, my friend,
is oil.

1383
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:22,094
O.k., now,
let's bear down here,
all right.

1384
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:23,648
Just watch
these sticks.

1385
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:26,167
It might take a while.

1386
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,653
It might take a while.

1387
01:16:28,653 --> 01:16:30,620
Yes, sir.

1388
01:16:44,151 --> 01:16:45,531
Wait a minute.

1389
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:50,364
I think
I do feel something.

1390
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,712
Where?

1391
01:16:53,712 --> 01:16:55,887
Where do you think
you feel something?

1392
01:16:55,887 --> 01:16:57,336
Huh?

1393
01:16:58,683 --> 01:17:00,167
It's not there?

1394
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:03,688
No.

1395
01:17:03,688 --> 01:17:05,172
Right in there.

1396
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:06,691
Damn. Me, too.

1397
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:09,521
Probably got a little coal
on your land, Don.

1398
01:17:09,521 --> 01:17:11,592
That's what
that means. Ha ha!

1399
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:14,699
Ha ha ha!

1400
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,183
Ha ha!

1401
01:17:35,202 --> 01:17:37,687
God, what an idiot.

1402
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:43,693
Ha ha ha!

1403
01:17:53,738 --> 01:17:55,774
Pardon me. Ha ha!

1404
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:09,892
M-Mr. Cox.

1405
01:18:09,892 --> 01:18:11,376
Huh?

1406
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:13,550
Mr. Cox!

1407
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,552
Come here.

1408
01:18:18,763 --> 01:18:20,765
Come here!

1409
01:18:20,765 --> 01:18:22,767
Spread them
right there.

1410
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:25,701
Right there,
no doubts about it.

1411
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,703
Don't move.

1412
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,221
Don't you move
an inch.

1413
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:30,636
I'll show you
something here.

1414
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:46,273
Ha ha ha!

1415
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:52,348
You found it first.
You Mark it.

1416
01:18:52,348 --> 01:18:53,867
[Meow]

1417
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:55,178
Ah...

1418
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:56,593
[Meow]

1419
01:18:56,593 --> 01:18:58,112
You're a little late,
darling.

1420
01:18:58,112 --> 01:18:59,596
You come in third.

1421
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,081
Ha ha ha!

1422
01:19:01,081 --> 01:19:02,634
Oh...

1423
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:05,119
It's a hell
of a business, ain't it?

1424
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:07,087
It's a hell of a business.

1425
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:18,132
[Man]
I'll be with you
in a minute.

1426
01:19:18,132 --> 01:19:20,100
Let me do
the dickering.

1427
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,516
I've dealt
with this bird before.

1428
01:19:22,516 --> 01:19:24,035
Lucas,
come over here.

1429
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:26,347
Mr. Cox?

1430
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:27,901
Huh?

1431
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:29,419
By golly, Mr. Cox.

1432
01:19:29,419 --> 01:19:31,421
Roy, you son
of a gun!

1433
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:32,906
I thought
that was you.

1434
01:19:32,906 --> 01:19:34,528
You looking
for work?

1435
01:19:34,528 --> 01:19:37,600
Yes, sir.
I could use some.

1436
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,740
Well, you got it.

1437
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:43,295
This is my partner
Don day.

1438
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:44,676
Don, this is Roy.

1439
01:19:44,676 --> 01:19:45,919
Nice
to meet you.

1440
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,748
Pleasure.

1441
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:49,439
Well,
let's get to it.

1442
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,699
Let's get started.

1443
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:09,080
[Car doors close]

1444
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:23,404
Come on, boys.
Here we go. Oh!

1445
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,484
Get it up!

1446
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:41,526
[Roy]
There you go, now.

1447
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:43,631
Make sure it's even
down there.

1448
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:48,982
We got her now!

1449
01:20:55,505 --> 01:20:56,990
[Don]
Coming up!

1450
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:11,349
[Roy]
It's higher than it looks.

1451
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:36,029
Hey, here's to luck!

1452
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:45,555
Yee-ha!

1453
01:21:45,555 --> 01:21:47,040
Yes, sir.

1454
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:55,289
Huh.

1455
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:58,568
No wonder...
You got a flood in here.

1456
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:06,093
What did
the authorities
have to say?

1457
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,095
They don't know
about it.

1458
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:11,305
They won't,
unless I choose
to tell them.

1459
01:22:11,305 --> 01:22:13,549
That gun was
found in a room

1460
01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:16,621
rented to a cheap
promoter named Cox.

1461
01:22:16,621 --> 01:22:19,589
Mr. Cox,
he calls himself.

1462
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:22,868
I want him found.

1463
01:22:22,868 --> 01:22:24,284
And?

1464
01:22:24,284 --> 01:22:26,079
Just found.

1465
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:35,605
How's it look?

1466
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:39,126
Clay.

1467
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:40,610
Huh?

1468
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:42,095
Clay.

1469
01:22:44,614 --> 01:22:46,651
Well,
I don't know.

1470
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:49,102
We're nearly
1,800 feet.

1471
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:02,632
See anything?

1472
01:23:02,632 --> 01:23:03,668
Nope.

1473
01:23:03,668 --> 01:23:05,635
Engine's kind of
running raggedy.

1474
01:23:05,635 --> 01:23:07,154
Losing power.

1475
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:09,639
Might be a good idea
to get an overhaul.

1476
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:11,158
Nope. Too much time.

1477
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:13,747
We have to have it in
by the 1st.

1478
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:14,990
Ha!

1479
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:20,650
I think I'll have myself
a little walk.

1480
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:22,135
Yeah.

1481
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:30,005
Sure seems to know
a lot about oil,
don't he?

1482
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,661
Uh-huh.

1483
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,700
Well, you worked
with him

1484
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,529
a lot of times,
haven't you?

1485
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:39,704
Oh, yeah.
Several times.

1486
01:23:39,704 --> 01:23:42,707
There's Phoenix number 21
I worked on.

1487
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:45,951
Then we done
Phoenix number 27.

1488
01:23:45,951 --> 01:23:47,988
And there's
some other Phoenix

1489
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:50,956
I can't remember
the number of right now.

1490
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:54,201
Well,
what's his affection
for Phoenix?

1491
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:56,755
Does he name
them all that?

1492
01:23:56,755 --> 01:23:58,481
Up to now he has,

1493
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:01,036
but that's just till
he hits his first strike.

1494
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,522
His firststrike?

1495
01:24:04,522 --> 01:24:06,731
Well, who did you think

1496
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:09,182
you was dealing with--
rockefeller?

1497
01:24:09,182 --> 01:24:13,220
You mean to...
You mean to tell me

1498
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,911
that he's never...

1499
01:24:14,911 --> 01:24:16,706
Nope.

1500
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:18,536
Not so far, he ain't.

1501
01:24:18,536 --> 01:24:20,883
Ha ha ha!

1502
01:24:27,924 --> 01:24:30,686
Well, I sure can
pick them, can't I?

1503
01:24:33,413 --> 01:24:36,485
Hell, I pull them
out of the woodwork.

1504
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:46,909
[Gasp]

1505
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:50,913
I wasn't doing
nothing bad.

1506
01:24:50,913 --> 01:24:52,915
I know, I know.

1507
01:24:52,915 --> 01:24:54,917
It's kind of
a long walk

1508
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:56,919
to henrietta,
isn't it?

1509
01:24:56,919 --> 01:24:58,541
Ha ha!

1510
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:02,373
How'd you know
I went to henrietta?

1511
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:04,444
I heard the hospital

1512
01:25:04,444 --> 01:25:06,929
let your boyfriend
go home.

1513
01:25:06,929 --> 01:25:08,965
How's he doing?

1514
01:25:08,965 --> 01:25:10,450
The doctor said

1515
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:13,936
one of his legs
might be a little gimpy.

1516
01:25:13,936 --> 01:25:16,111
I'm sorry
to hear that.

1517
01:26:20,002 --> 01:26:22,487
God, you're
a stubborn woman.

1518
01:26:32,014 --> 01:26:33,533
Not here.

1519
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:36,501
I want you back
where you belong.

1520
01:26:41,023 --> 01:26:42,680
[Man]
Hello, Dave.

1521
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,026
Yeah, I found him.

1522
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:46,546
He's on a farm
about 3 miles west

1523
01:26:46,546 --> 01:26:48,203
of henrietta--
the day farm.

1524
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,549
You done good.

1525
01:26:49,549 --> 01:26:51,792
Want me to notify
the authorities?

1526
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:54,554
I said I'll
take care of it.

1527
01:26:54,554 --> 01:26:56,556
Go on back
to Houston.

1528
01:26:56,556 --> 01:26:58,523
Leave the rest to me.

1529
01:27:07,049 --> 01:27:08,568
Whoa.

1530
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:10,535
What do we
have here?

1531
01:27:13,089 --> 01:27:16,576
Why don't you
just give that
to the old man?

1532
01:27:16,576 --> 01:27:20,062
Bea and I
will dish out
the rest of these.

1533
01:27:20,062 --> 01:27:21,546
Hold that, Roy.

1535
01:27:29,313 --> 01:27:31,107
Yeah?

1536
01:27:31,107 --> 01:27:32,557
Oh, thank you.

1537
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:36,112
If it's too cold
tonight,

1538

you're more
than welcome
in the house.

1539
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:40,807
Thank you, ma'am,
but we're too close
to the pay now.

1540

We're almost there.

1541
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,879

Roy, get that lantern
over here!

Point it in here
and tell me what you see,

1548
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,266
what you smell,
and what you taste.

1549

I'm going to
let you get some.

1550
01:28:30,788 --> 01:28:32,583
Your first taste, son.

1551
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,793
First--
first time, son.

1552
01:28:35,793 --> 01:28:38,416
It's better
than ice cream,
isn't it?

1553
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:39,900
Mmm.

1554

That's oil.

1555

you did it.

Woo!

01:28:48,668 --> 01:28:51,187
Now, what I need
is storage tanks.

we need those tanks now.

Give this to him.

will blow over in a minute.

What the hell?

1609
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:45,741
Button it up.
Let's go.

1610
01:31:45,741 --> 01:31:47,225
Get in the car.

1611
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:48,951
Get in
the damn car.

1612
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:35,550
Help!

1613

Ha ha ha!

1614
01:32:53,533 --> 01:32:56,053
All right,
y'all get over there

1615
01:32:56,053 --> 01:32:58,365
and help them
on that thing.

1616
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:00,229
You boys,

1617
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:02,266
get them barrels down.

1618
01:33:02,266 --> 01:33:04,717
Get them storage tanks
over there.

1619
01:33:04,717 --> 01:33:07,340
We're bringing it in
for you, Mr. Cox!

1620
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,791
You done good, Roy.
You brought half
the town with you.

1621
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:11,551
All right, then.

1622
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:13,311

Don, get two
lengths of pipe.

1641
01:35:02,179 --> 01:35:03,663
We'll blow it out.

1642
01:35:03,663 --> 01:35:05,182
Blow it out?

1643
01:35:05,182 --> 01:35:07,667
That's the only way
we can get it out.

1644
01:35:11,188 --> 01:35:14,294

get rid of this.

Mr. Cox made it,
all right.

1715
01:40:42,657 --> 01:40:45,073
He did move
a little slower

1716
01:40:45,073 --> 01:40:46,523
than he did before,

1717
01:40:46,523 --> 01:40:49,077
and the doctor
said his hearing

1718
01:40:49,077 --> 01:40:51,010
would never be
the same again.

you say, Don?

not bad!

at all.

give this man
some peace?

No, no, she's fine.
She's fine.

1730
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,530
Mr. Cox,
you're going to
spoil her rotten.

He paid back all
his "investors" with interest,

1732
01:41:44,063 --> 01:41:47,584
even that horrible
Dave mcdermit.

1733
01:41:47,584 --> 01:41:51,070
Mr. Cox was an oilman,
not a thief.

1734
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,141
Oilman or not,

1735
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:55,592
it wasn't long
before Mr. Cox

1736
01:41:55,592 --> 01:41:58,836
got what he called
"bugs between his toes,"

1737
01:41:58,836 --> 01:42:02,737
or "itchy feet" as some
less colorful might say.

1738
01:42:04,256 --> 01:42:07,086
Here. Let me
take that for you.

1739
01:42:07,086 --> 01:42:09,571
Thank you, Raymond.
Thank you.

1740
01:42:14,611 --> 01:42:16,820
Thanks for the little
get-together, Cora.

1741
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:18,753
You're welcome,
Mr. Cox.

1742
01:42:23,585 --> 01:42:25,104
Bless you.

1743
01:42:27,175 --> 01:42:29,108
All right,
this is it.

1744
01:42:29,108 --> 01:42:31,110
Raymond, bring that
over here.

1745
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:34,113
See what you're made of.
Ha ha!

1746
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:36,115
Throw it in there.

1747
01:42:36,115 --> 01:42:37,599
Yes, sir.

1748
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:39,118
And, uh...

1749
01:42:40,637 --> 01:42:42,121
Be careful, Don.

1750
01:42:42,121 --> 01:42:43,502
You, too, Mr. Cox.

1751
01:42:43,502 --> 01:42:44,917
What was that?

1752
01:42:44,917 --> 01:42:46,953
I said you, too,
Mr. Cox!

1753
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:50,509
Oh, I will be, Don.
I will be.

1754
01:42:50,509 --> 01:42:52,580
You can bet on that.

1755
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:56,342
Yes, sir. Come here.
Get in, darling.

1756
01:42:56,342 --> 01:42:59,138
Kitty, kitty.
Come on. Get in.

1757
01:42:59,138 --> 01:43:00,760
Now...

1758
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,935
I got a special
little gift

1759
01:43:02,935 --> 01:43:05,420
for a special little
friend of mine.

1760
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:08,527
Thank you.

1761
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:10,322
You're welcome.

1762
01:43:10,322 --> 01:43:12,151
Now I'm going to
tell you something.

1763
01:43:12,151 --> 01:43:13,152
Nobody else
can hear this.

1764
01:43:19,641 --> 01:43:21,402
I promise.

1765
01:43:21,402 --> 01:43:23,197
You promise?

1766
01:43:25,647 --> 01:43:27,442
Well...

1767
01:43:27,442 --> 01:43:29,168
Well, folks,

1768
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:33,172
there will be no tears
shed here today...

1769
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:35,174
Including myself.

1770
01:43:35,174 --> 01:43:38,695
Ha ha ha!

1771
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:40,662
You're fine people...

1772
01:43:43,182 --> 01:43:45,115
And I want
to thank you.

1773
01:43:45,115 --> 01:43:47,013
I really mean that.

1774
01:43:52,364 --> 01:43:54,469
So good-bye for now.

1775
01:43:54,469 --> 01:43:56,195
[Pauline]
Good-bye.

1776
01:43:56,195 --> 01:43:57,714
Get over there,
darlin'.

1777
01:43:57,714 --> 01:43:59,198
Get over there.

1778
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:01,752
She doesn't want
to go. Ha ha!

1779
01:44:03,547 --> 01:44:06,619
Finest people
I ever knew in my life.

1780
01:44:09,967 --> 01:44:12,211
Till we meet again.

1781
01:44:12,211 --> 01:44:14,213
Bye. Bye-bye.

1782
01:44:18,148 --> 01:44:21,289
That was the last time
we saw Mr. Cox.

1783
01:44:21,289 --> 01:44:24,603
He sold out his interest
in the field,

1784
01:44:24,603 --> 01:44:26,087
and that was that.

1785
01:44:26,087 --> 01:44:27,433
He made a lot
of money,

1786
01:44:27,433 --> 01:44:28,883
no question about that.

1787
01:44:28,883 --> 01:44:30,367
Hail to oil!

1788
01:44:30,367 --> 01:44:32,956
But he could have
made a lot more

1789
01:44:32,956 --> 01:44:34,958
if he'd stayed around
a while.

1790
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:37,443
The rumor was he took it all
to California

1791
01:44:37,443 --> 01:44:39,445
and got into real estate,

1792
01:44:39,445 --> 01:44:42,137
lost every dime he had.

1793
01:44:42,137 --> 01:44:43,967
Ha ha! I don't know
about that.

1794
01:44:43,967 --> 01:44:45,831
I don't think
it was the money

1795
01:44:45,831 --> 01:44:48,420
he really cared about,
anyway.

1796
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:51,423
It was the life
he loved

1797
01:44:51,423 --> 01:44:54,426
and the game
that goes with it.

1798
01:44:54,426 --> 01:44:56,462
I'll never forget

1799
01:44:56,462 --> 01:45:00,432
what he whispered to me
in my ear that day--

1800
01:45:00,432 --> 01:45:03,952
"hitch your wagon
to a star, sweetheart."

1801
01:45:03,952 --> 01:45:06,921
I've lived my life by that.
