1
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,440
FIRE!

2
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,400
FOR MY CHILDREN - G.V.B.

3
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,680
"Tordo 3" calling
"Tordo l" and "Tordo 2".

4
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,120
Attention! Move towards
the arch of the clock tower

5
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,320
and to the church.
Stop the traffic. Over.

6
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,480
"Tordo l", order received
and carried out. Over.

7
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,560
Andreoli, give yourself up!
0me out with your hands up!

8
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,880
Can you hear me?

9
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,000
Listen to me, Mario!

10
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,760
Come out. Think of your little girl!

11
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
Listen, Mario. Come on.

12
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
It's Damiani, the lance-corporal.

13
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,160
Mario, we known nothing's happened.
Come on, come down.

14
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
Come on Mario...

15
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,760
Come on, come down.
A few shots don't scare anyone.

16
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,720
How's your wife? Your aunt?

17
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,040
How's your mother-in-law?

18
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,840
Come on, come down.

19
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,800
Then you can tell me
where you got all that stuff.

20
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,560
Stop acting crazy, come on.

21
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,480
Have you gone mad?
Think of your family, Mario.

22
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,560
Think of your little girl.

23
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
Can you hear me?

24
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,520
It's Damiani. Can you hear me?

25
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,880
Will you show me them?

26
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,920
Will you come to the door?
Where's your wife?

27
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,080
Let us see your mother-in-law, Mario!

28
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,440
Listen, Mario.

29
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,440
Come on, stop acting cray.

30
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,200
You don't frighten anyone, Mario!

31
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,800
We all know you're a good guy.

32
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
Come down, come on.

33
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,320
Mario! Mario, are you listening?

34
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,960
It's Damiani.

35
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,840
Now you're a bit calmer,
will you tell me something?

36
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,640
Why did you shoot at the Madonna?

37
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,920
Are you crazy?

38
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,520
Why today? You've ruined
those poor people's feast.

39
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,960
They were having fun. The feast,
the procession and everything.

40
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Lidia!

41
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,840
Who is it, Lidia?
We were worried.

42
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Thank God. Are you ok?
Are you all okay?

43
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,760
How's your mother?
Are you all OK in there?

44
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,040
Anyway, it's all over now,
isn't it? Are you okay Lidia?

45
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,960
Ls your mother all right?

46
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,240
What about your mother?
Are you all OK?

47
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,080
It's all finished now, isn't it?

48
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
All of you...

49
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,920
Andreoli!

50
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
Andreoli?

51
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,920
It's the press! Can you hear me?

52
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,960
I'm up here, on the roof,
l'm talking to you through the chimney.

53
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,800
Andreoli, can you hear me?
I'm speaking through the chimney!

54
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,840
There's a whole village
living here with you.

55
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,160
We heard the shots in the house.
Nothing happened, did it?

56
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,480
How's your mother-in-law?
Is she hurt?

57
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,040
Andreoli, can you do an interview
with me?

58
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,720
If I ask the carabinieri,
will you let the photographer in?

59
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,680
I can't hear you,
but l'm sure you can hear me.

60
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,080
Andreoli? Come on, answer me.

61
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,040
Do you want to say something?

62
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,400
Andreoli, l'll write you
a nice article in the paper.

63
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,200
You have to let the photographer in,
Come on.

64
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,280
It's not vey comfortable up here.

65
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,560
Will you answer me?
I'll send you photographer, ok?

66
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,560
He's only going to take your photo!

67
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,800
And then we'll talk from here. I'll
write you a great article in the paper.

68
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,880
I only need five minutes
for an interview.

69
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,840
Andreoli, come on, answer me.
It's not vey comfortable up here.

70
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,200
Shall I send the photographer?
I'll only take your photograph!

71
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,320
Then we can talk from here. I'll do
a nice article about you in the paper.

72
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,720
It's not much fun up here.
Why don't you answer?

73
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,920
Shall I send the photographer?
It's only a photo, dear God!

74
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,440
We can talk from here and then
I'll do a nice article on you.

75
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,840
There's a crowd of people down here
waiting for you to speak.

76
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,040
Oh, you see?
That's it. I can hear you knocking.

77
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,840
Why don't you speak instead
of knocking? Andreoli, say something.

78
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,080
What are you doing up here?

79
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,200
- You can't stay up here.
- Please, go away.

80
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,680
Come down. Who let you up here?

81
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,080
- I'm talking to him, for God's sake!
- Come down or l'll have you arrested!

82
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:57,720
The problem is we don't know
who's inside.

83
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,520
The problem is we don't know
who's inside.

84
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,920
There should be his wife,
his child and the mother-in-law.

85
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
But there might also be a relative
who went to visit.

86
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,960
Then there's the problem of the
weapons. How did he get so many?

87
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,280
Perhaps he's got dynamite, too.

88
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,480
If it's as his wife says,
he'll blow up the whole village.

89
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,840
He's been in there for hours.

90
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,600
I don't understand how he managed
to get so many weapons!

91
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,440
He's always been a good kid. Then
all of a sudden, look what he does!

92
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,160
It's not that he's...

93
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,040
It's Damiani, do you recognise me?

94
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,360
How many people are in there with you?

95
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,400
Lidia? Cinzia? Who else?

96
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Do you remember when you asked me
to call the hospital?

97
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,040
When your kid was being born?

98
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,200
I shouldn't have let you phone.

99
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,120
But I made an exception for you.

100
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,680
When the nun told me
it was a little girl.

101
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,600
Cinzia. Uh, do you remember?

102
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,520
You were so happy.

103
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,480
Come down, come on.
We're not going to shoot you.

104
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,240
We can't shoot you.
You haven't done anything.

105
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,920
Come on, for a few shots? You've
got it off your chest now, right?

106
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,080
Why don't you come down?
Come on, Mario.

107
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,160
Listen to me. We're friends,
aren't we?

108
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,360
Mario, are you listening?

109
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,920
At least come out.

110
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,920
Mario, will you let us see you?

111
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,520
Then you can tell us
where you got all that stuff from.

112
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,520
All those weapons...

113
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,200
Mario, don't go.

114
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,200
What's happened?

115
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,760
I'm sending you a basket.

116
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:00,760
There's some milk and a lemonade.

117
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,800
There are some cigarettes for you.

118
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
You don't think we've drugged them,
do you?

119
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,000
I'll smoke one. Look.

120
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,720
Look, Mario. Do you see?

121
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,760
Do you see? Do you want one?

122
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,600
Go on! Take one!

123
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,480
Look. Listen to me.
The lemonade is for you.

124
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,040
It's all we could find.

125
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,960
You don't think
we want to put you to sleep?

126
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,160
Come down into the street now.
I want to talk to you better.

127
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,720
See what we've got for you?

128
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,960
Bottles! Show us you're good.

129
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,920
Show us what a good shot you are.

130
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,560
Why don't you show us?
Shooting at walls is easy.

131
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:01,320
But shooting bottles...
Come on, shoot, hit them.

132
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,120
Do it, if you can,
show us how good you are.

133
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,600
I can give you a ladder.
Just the last bit, then you're OK.

134
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,000
Come on, come down,
or we'll come up.

135
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,280
Mario? What are you doing,
are you coming?

136
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,880
Mario, what are you doing?
Why are you shooting again?

137
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,840
- Your dad and your brother are here.
- Mario, stop it!

138
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,160
But are you serious?

139
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,640
Murderer.

140
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:57,840
You're a murderer!

141
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:01,760
You're a murderer!

142
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,680
Did something happen?
Who shouted?

143
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,640
Come on, come out!

144
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,880
Mario... What? I didn't hear you!

145
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,360
What have you done, Mario?
Who shouted?

146
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,800
Are you all OK in there?

147
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,720
Mario, have you gone crazy?
Come on, come out of there.

148
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,040
Mario, come on, come down.

149
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,600
How are they? Are they all okay?

150
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,160
Say something!

151
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,720
Be a good kid. Come down.

152
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,680
Nothing's going to happen.

153
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,280
Come down.

154
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,760
Mario, listen. We'll find you a job.

155
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,440
Everything will be like before.

156
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:29,520
Think of the little girl.
Think of Lidia.

157
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,680
There's no one here now.
They've all gone away.

158
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:36,800
It's just me and you. That's it.

159
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,200
Now we've given you the ladder,
what are you waiting for?

160
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:56,800
First you come down,
and then the women.

161
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,280
Listen to me.

162
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:19,760
Eveyone knows you're a good kid.

163
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,240
Nothing will happen to you.
It's just me waiting for you.

164
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,920
Come on, you know me.
We've known each other for years.

165
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,920
You can trust me. Don't you trust me?

166
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,720
Are you cray? Come on...

167
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,800
We've waited, it doesn't matter.
A couple of shots don't scare anyone.

168
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,160
Nothing's happened.

169
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,800
We'll forget everything. Unders_nd?

170
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,880
We're agreed, no?

171
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,040
I'm alone. Don't you trust me?

172
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,640
I give you my word.
There's no one else.

173
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,280
We'll bring the ladder down from
the roof. We'll put it on the balcony.

174
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:28,960
Will you give us the little girl?
Pass her to us.

175
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,760
We'll send you the ladder.
You don't have to take the poles out.

176
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,760
Yes, you can leave the door closed.

177
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:38,320
Don't take the pole out,
you don't need to.

178
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,560
Don't you trust me?

179
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:52,800
Think of your daughter!

180
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,960
And of Lidia, poor kid,
aren't you thinking of her?

181
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,320
There's a good lad.

182
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,160
I'll give you some cord, OK?

183
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,560
OK?

184
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:26,520
The revolver and the rifle.

185
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,880
Have you tied it?

186
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,560
Nothing will happen if you come down.

187
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,800
We won't shoot.
We can't shoot you, you know?

188
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,120
If you haven't shot anyone...

189
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,560
...then come down.

190
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:04,440
We'll wait for you here.

191
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:09,280
Mario, nothing's happened, has it?
