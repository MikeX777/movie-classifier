1
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,234
When the human race reaches the first stars

2
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,988
The time will come

3
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,669
And a new era is born

4
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,795
and the eternal question will be asked

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,873
What will this hold for what we call - humanity?

6
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,200
What's more important Simon, your son or your
research?

7
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,954
That's not fair, Caroline. I've worked for the past 2 years
perfecting this technology.

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,353
I can't just quit! Keep practicing those moves.

9
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,032
I will be home for dinner.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,274
I've heard that before.

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,509
So have I.

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Oh Simon... the capacitors are almost fully charged!

13
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:58,998
Arthur, your as bad as Simon!

14
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,352
It runs in the programming!

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,758
Love you!

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,710
Bye, Dad.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,839
All right, Arthur. Let's see how stable this is.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,519
This is looking good, Simon.

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,393
Confirm spatial differential.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,472
Come on, baby, come on!

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,752
Confirmed. Far side telemetry initiating.

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,270
Connection established and secured.

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,311
Searching star charts. Location confirmed.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,270
Virgo cluster, unknown planetary mass.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,393
Yes! Finally. One more step, Arthur, and we will never
have to worry about funding again!

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,875
Discharging in three, two, one.

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,189
Simon you've done it!

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,309
I had my doubts.

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,794
Overcoming doubts will only strengthen you.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,758
Come on. Help me with my suit.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,832
Hover Platform engaged. Powering particle emitters.

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,679
Powering particle emitters.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,638
All systems are go!

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,796
To enter the portal without proper back-up.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,752
It is a breach of your own security protocol

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,831
I've run the simulation program a dozen times.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,670
Everything is fine.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,279
I have to take the next step now!

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,038
I can't afford to wait for more tests

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,276
Platform data stream secure. Communications channel
secure.

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,755
Bio-Suit integrity... one hundred percent.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,111
Body life signs normal.

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,805
Simon, I won't be able to reach you

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,034
if you're farther than 10 meters from the portal.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,595
Don't worry, I won't be long.

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,117
Seismic sensors activated.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,479
Terrain... stable.

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,316
Analyzing atmospherics... stand by

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,432
Environment suitable for carbon based life forms.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,238
I'm going to take a quick look around.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,674
This is amazing, Simon. We're getting everything on this
end.

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,752
Alert, alert!

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,076
- Simon, I'm getting something on the scanner.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,150
Something big!

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,471
Behind you. You must get to the portal, Simon!!!

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,632
Arthur

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,751
get me out of here!

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,558
Oh, no!!! Simon! You must get to the portal, Simon!!!

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,753
Try and grab my arm!

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,271
Bio-suit life signs terminated.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,158
Tracking beacon, "Non-operational

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,118
data-stream disrupted. Warning, Warning.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,711
Unknown error. Portal connection lost.

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,631
No! Simon! Simon!!!

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,192
Emergency shutdown initiated.

66
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,473
Simon!!!

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,434
I have a gift for the High Priestess!

68
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,438
I have trapped this creature in the forest.

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,752
But it is unlike anything I have seen before.

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,311
Go your way and speak of this to no one.

71
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,238
Good shot Ragis

72
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,509
just as I taught you.

73
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,358
You are getting as good with that bow,

74
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,433
as your little friend is at learning the ways of the high
priestess.

75
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,956
Can I keep him?

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,755
Yes, my young Ragis.

77
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,791
But that means you will be responsible for our small
guest.

78
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,759
Shepway, where is it come from?

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,433
Jac

80
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,713
You've found your father’s wristband.

81
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,668
He'd want you to have it.

82
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,150
Jac, he's

83
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,277
...missing! He's missing, mom.

84
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,953
That means he can be found.

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,593
It's been 7 years, honey

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,115
That's a long time.

87
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,637
You have to start looking forward.

88
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,350
I've heard his voice

89
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,552
calling out to me, trying to reach us

90
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,519
Jack, you were dreaming

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,072
The same dream for 7 years?

92
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,475
He's out there, mom

93
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,073
trying to get home. I know it

94
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,675
Sometimes we want something so badly.

95
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,319
We convince ourselves that it's true.

96
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,029
Your Father is gone Jack

97
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,325
you have to accept it.

98
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,555
Not until I find out for sure what happened to dad.

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,559
You know what happened.

100
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,355
All we know is that he was working on a classified project

101
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,033
at a secret location.

102
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,358
He told us he was coming home

103
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,789
but he never showed up.

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,599
I wanna know why.

105
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,714
Jac, I understand.

106
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,309
I miss him too.

107
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,990
I just wanna find him.

108
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,516
Jac.

109
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,676
Scanning all binary nodes.

110
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,317
All nodes are negative for DNA or sensory algorithms.

111
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,113
Access to advance core function restrictive by the
planetary collective.

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,276
Any Violation of collective code 7.02.09.03.033.129

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,230
Subchapter C Beta 925

114
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,832
Another dead end!

115
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,351
Time grows short.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,197
Tor has almost finished building his army.

117
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,637
And lead an attack against Tor

118
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,830
before he gains the strength of his forces.

119
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,879
Only Ragis can lead Raphicca away from Tor's treachery

120
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,275
and back into the light.

121
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,829
Unless he learns the truth

122
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,558
he will never raise arms against Tor.

123
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,674
Then it is time he learns that truth.

124
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,709
And what about Simon?

125
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,189
Good! Good!

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,277
Good, Ragis, keep the movement flowing.

127
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,598
Yes. That was great, Ragis! You're a natural warrior.

128
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,551
My father told me the same thing.

129
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,834
Jack is a very fortunate son to have a father like you!

130
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,234
I've been perfecting this portal for 7 years now.

131
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,996
I've tried so many times,

132
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,310
but haven't been able to get the slip-stream to align.

133
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,675
But you have talked to Jack.

134
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,632
You' seen him thru the portal opening.

135
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,869
Yes, I just don't know if he was able to hear or see me!

136
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,749
With these new modifications

137
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,829
and Shepway's help, I know I will be successful this time.

138
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,593
Getting home is all I've dreamt of since I've arrived here.

139
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,513
But I never realized how painful it was going to be to
leave you

140
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,271
Ragis.

141
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,598
I always knew you would return to your family.

142
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,595
But now that the day has come,

143
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,556
I cannot envision my life without you.

144
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,758
You'll never be without me, Ragis.

145
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,833
I may not be here physically,

146
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,191
but our spirits will always be linked.

147
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,232
Ragis.

148
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,069
I've done everything I can do, Shepway.

149
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
I need your gifts to bring the Portal to life.

150
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,430
One of my crystals has been lost!

151
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,958
Will your remaining crystals

152
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,278
be strong enough to engage the Portal?

153
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,229
We shall see.

154
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,755
Close your eyes. Breathe slowly

155
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,633
deeply.

156
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,513
You have spoken of your son

157
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,876
each day that I have known you.

158
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,995
Bring Jac into your present mind.

159
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,710
Establish a spiritual connection with him. That will
transcend physical distance.

160
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,035
Jac!

161
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,988
Jac!

162
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,071
Dad? Dad?

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,992
Yes. It's me, Jac.

164
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,874
I knew it, I knew you were alive, dad!

165
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,750
Are you and your mom okay?

166
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,311
Yeah, yeah ya we're fine. Where are you?

167
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,478
Very far away.

168
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,996
What's wrong?

169
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,152
I can't get through

170
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,836
too much interference in the Portal slipstream.

171
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,993
The what?! How can I find you?

172
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,549
...Callisto...

173
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,873
find Hymo... at D.R. Droids

174
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,357
These are the private Chambers of the High Priestess of
Raphicca.

175
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,559
By what right do you enter?

176
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,910
I am the king.

177
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,674
I go wherever it pleases me.

178
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,952
What treachery have you been weaving with the human?

179
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,791
I owe you no explanation

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,195
for such a baseless accusation.

181
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,717
My king, I can assure you there has been no treachery
here.

182
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,078
Perhaps you are unaware of the true motivation

183
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,273
behind Shepway's actions.

184
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,111
That is impossible.

185
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,155
Shepway has been my loyal mentor since I was born.

186
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,272
I trust her with my life.

187
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,792
Then your trust has been misplaced.

188
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,598
Did you develop this evil sorcery to aid the rebels?

189
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,795
Of course not!

190
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,632
The human wished to return home, that is all.

191
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,714
King Tor, I implore you to cease

192
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,565
Your crystal was recovered... in a rebel hideout.

193
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,709
How could you turn you back on your kingdom... and on
me?

194
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,951
Prince Ragis, there is something you must know... Your
father... ahh!

195
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,837
Traitor!

196
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,270
No!! Shepway!!

197
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,111
Seek your father's truth.

198
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,309
Murderer!!

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,030
No more killing.

200
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,709
Take them to the dungeon!

201
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,914
Come along, Ragis.

202
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,836
Get your hands off me!

203
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,035
No... Ragis!

204
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,351
So, Can you do two tons?

205
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,550
No problem.

206
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,075
Then all we got left to talk about is price.

207
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,120
Mom, I gotta talk to you.

208
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,032
In a minute.

209
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,039
- No, mom, it can't wait.

210
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,915
Dad's alive, ok! I just talked to him.

211
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,593
I don't have time for this right now.

212
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,554
Well, Me neither. You wanna unload some veggies or
not?

213
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,337
Definitely.

214
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:35,795
Caroline Weir?

215
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:36,958
Yes.

216
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,555
Agent Po, Galactic Intelligence.

217
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,549
Were you aware that a restricted database was breached
from your computer account?

218
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,469
You must be mistaken.

219
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,233
To the contrary, Mrs. Weir.

220
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,550
I'm absolutely certain.

221
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,559
I'm telling you, no one has access to my account

222
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,710
but me, and...

223
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,588
Listen lady

224
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,230
when you wanna talk tomatoes,

225
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,637
Don't go, please. I'll get rid of him in no time.

226
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,877
I Don't think so.

227
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,672
Accessing restricted databases is a class three offense.

228
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,071
Pending the completion of my investigation,

229
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,271
I am suspending your trading license.

230
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,152
How am I supposed to make a living?

231
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,317
I am also placing you under house arrest.

232
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,279
Lucky for you, you have a nice house.

233
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,438
If you leave your biosphere for any reason,

234
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,513
you will be subject to immediate arrest and incarceration.

235
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,394
That's great, just great.

236
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,432
The details are all here. Good day.

237
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,553
I am an automated surveillance droid.

238
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,189
Any attempt to tamper with my systems or prevent me
from tracking your location is a violation of the law...

239
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:57,353
That..., right there, that's a violation of! Oh, that does
it.

240
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,310
But mom!

241
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,670
Your little prank just cost us our trading license.

242
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,751
And now, we are forbidden to leave the farm.

243
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,833
Mom, mom listen I know how crazy this all sounds.

244
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,911
But I'm telling you the truth.

245
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,434
There was an energy field -

246
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,312
a ring of light.

247
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,240
He was trying to come through. He was almost through,
mom!

248
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,192
Jack

249
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,236
do you know how many times in the past 7 years you
told me you've heard your Father's voice?

250
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,397
I know, but this was different.

251
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,675
He actually talked to me...

252
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,275
He said to go to Callisto.

253
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,116
Yeah, D. R. Droids.

254
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,965
He was sooo close, mom.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,549
- Let it go, Jac! No! No I am not letting him go!

256
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,635
Calisto...

257
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,270
Calisto...

258
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,355
Dad's lab was there.

259
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,754
I almost forgot, I found it in one of his packets.

260
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,005
Let's go.

261
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:59,790
I remembered that you father did mention something

262
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,434
and of course you wouldn't have known that.

263
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,157
I'm sorry I never believe you.

264
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,595
Oh... It's OK, MOM.

265
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,478
It seems crazy to me too.

266
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,268
You know Jac, there's a lot of your father in you.

267
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,752
You don't think they're looking for us, do you?

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,592
No way.

269
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,513
What?

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,194
It looks like we've got company.

271
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,871
...No way do we outrun him,

272
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,116
not in this old beater.

273
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,877
I guess you were too young to remember your mom's
favorite past time.

274
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,798
- You mean giving me a hard time?

275
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,194
- Okay, second favorite.

276
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,032
- No, what?

277
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,753
Rebuilding cruiser engines.

278
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,639
Way to go, mom!

279
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,795
This is office 54 requesting back up.

280
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,633
Suspects have violated house arrest and are subject to
immediate apprehension.

281
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,956
There's three of them. Go go go.

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,230
Bring your vessel to a stop immediately, you're under
arrest.

283
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,951
Whoa, Mum, out off control!

284
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,310
I need you to help me find a place to hide.

285
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,037
Wugh! Mom, there, Head in there.

286
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,149
Stay sharp, this lady's good.

287
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,718
Stay sharp, this lady's good.

288
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,835
Mom, sensors show something moving up ahead

289
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,113
But I can't tell what it is?

290
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,589
Mom, Scavengers

291
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,353
I hope it is scavengers.

292
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,716
- Looks like he blew a gasket. - I hope his insurance is
paid up.

293
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,957
I don't see them on sensors. Suspects escaped.

294
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,079
Return to base.

295
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,559
I can't believe you just pulled that off.

296
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,834
Transport 9075 will be departing from launch bay 5.

297
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,912
All passengers and cargo...

298
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,199
Still no sign of them.

299
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:59,656
D.R. Droids

300
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:09,632
hello there!

301
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,718
Well

302
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,317
Well, hello there! C'mon in!

303
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,477
I've got the droid to fit your needs.

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,713
The Keyton 972?

305
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,600
Strong and efficient. Lifts 200 tons with one arm.

306
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,750
Doesn't break a sweat. Even in 7200 degrees!

307
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,525
But we're...

308
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,913
Ah, how about Hawkings III?

309
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,351
Cracks into "The Universe in a Nutshell" as well as any
bank account!

310
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,005
All we need...

311
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,520
IDMT pioneer. EX 2 butler

312
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:38,805
Alpha 450...

313
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,832
sucks, plugs and dries in any oxygen-based
environment...

314
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,956
Retro-fratphammonia planets? Can do!

315
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,590
Glad to hear it, but we're lookin' for someone with another
name...

316
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,878
Hymo.

317
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,038
Well you found me.

318
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,429
What can I do for you?

319
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,431
I'm Jac Weir,

320
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,390
and this is my mother Caroline.

321
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,790
Give it to me.

322
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,835
You're a droid!

323
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,997
You have amazing powers of observation.

324
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,155
That's unreal... You're practically perfect.

325
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,795
Practically? I'm road-tested, son...

326
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,756
Simon created me to protect his secret.

327
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,032
From everyone but you two, that is. For seven years

328
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,793
I waited for you to come

329
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,515
because my access level cannot...

330
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,669
the door to Simon's lab.

331
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,671
Only you, Jac, matches the DNA passcode.

332
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,750
Mission complete!

333
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,473
Arthur!

334
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,948
Arthur! Arthur!

335
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,869
Arthur... Can you hear me?

336
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,959
Looks like his power pack's been trashed.

337
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,796
Oh! I got an idea.

338
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,471
Oh! Mrs. Weir.

339
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,913
I'm so sorry for my ghastly appearance.

340
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,713
At least you're still in one piece.

341
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,358
What happened, Arthur? Where's Simon?

342
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,273
In the Virgo cluster.

343
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,710
27.2 million light years away.

344
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,958
This must be it. Dad's secret project.

345
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,830
It's a Moebius Field Portal, based on the theory of
"Internal Transfer Loops."

346
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,034
Maybe you could explain it a little more... simply.

347
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,800
When a three dimensional cylindrical loop is given a 180
degree twist,

348
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,791
it becomes a two dimensional mathematical oddity

349
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,757
known as a Moebius strip.

350
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,628
By twisting two of the existing parameters of space,

351
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,476
Professor Weir was able to manipulate the third
parameter,

352
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,716
which is distance...

353
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,753
You call that "simply"?

354
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,231
Professor Weir created a conduit

355
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,596
to any location in the known universe.

356
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,549
All you have to do is walk through here

357
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,718
and you can go anywhere in the galaxy!

358
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,511
That's how Simon wound up 30 million light years away?

359
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,715
Actually 27.2.

360
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,317
After the Professor went through the portal,

361
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,670
he was attacked by one of the planet's indigenous
population.

362
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,238
This foliage crashed through the gateway and disabled
the Portal.

363
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:40,478
My function was to protect Professor Weir. I did
everything in my power to save him, but...

364
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,751
I failed.

365
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,869
Can you get the Portal up and running?

366
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,596
That would depend on the extent of the damage.

367
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,317
You did it!

368
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,831
Connection established and secured.

369
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,471
The Professor's safety specifications

370
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,070
require a minimum Stability Factor of 90% before
accessing the Portal.

371
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,758
Field integrity failing.

372
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,480
It's losing stability!

373
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:32,278
Jac!!!

374
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,154
I'm going after my son!

375
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,398
No! You will be vaporized!

376
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,313
Then bring it back on line!

377
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,833
Emergency shutdown initiated.

378
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,598
Dad? Dad?

379
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:30,832
How beautiful

380
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,870
So much power inside it.

381
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,072
I need the secret of this magic. Guards!

382
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,710
Shepway foretold that Ragis was the one who would
restore Raphicca to glory.

383
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,556
We cannot let her death prevent him from fulfilling his
destiny.

384
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,632
I'm sorry Simon.

385
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,673
You were so close to returning to your family. What pain
you must be feeling.

386
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,837
We've all suffered.

387
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,394
How could you betray me?

388
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,278
We did no such thing!

389
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,471
Shepway conspired with the rebels.

390
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,079
The king was within his right to punish her.

391
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,593
Stop! Tor murdered Shepway. How dare you try to justify
it.

392
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,271
What does your intuition tell you, Ragis? That Allana and
I would be disloyal to you?

393
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,191
King Tor found Shepway's crystal in the rebel cave.

394
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,155
Proof of what? Only that Shepway distrusted Tor.

395
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,196
But Tor is the King of Raphicca.

396
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:51,993
But Tor is the King of Raphicca.

397
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,600
Tor is dragging Raphicca into the darkness!

398
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:57,830
Were you deaf to Shepway's teachings?

399
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,832
You are the chosen one. Ragis

400
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,515
The king who will lead us back into the light.

401
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,110
I will assume the throne four moons from now on my
18th birthday.

402
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,870
As custom dictates.

403
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,838
You won't live that long!

404
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,714
Shepway's last words to me were,

405
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,913
Seek your father's truth. What "truth"?

406
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,070
Do you know how your father died?

407
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,595
He and Tor were on a journey to the outer lands. He was
gored by a wild Espar.

408
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,958
Did you see your father's body?

409
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,908
No, only Shepway did.

410
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,436
Shepway told us what she saw.

411
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,229
There was one puncture wound through Akis' chest.

412
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,957
That's impossible.

413
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,712
Espar horns have a forked tip.

414
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,629
No! Only one. From Tor's sword!

415
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,588
You accuse King Tor of killing my father?!

416
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,910
His own brother?! I won't hear of it!

417
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,277
Dad?

418
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,309
What?

419
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:29,113
Alright...

420
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,998
Ahh...

421
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,596
Tell me how you came to Raphicca, alien.

422
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,716
Through a Moebius Field Portal.

423
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,520
You know, the theory of internal transfer loops, you take
a three dimensional cylindrical loop,

424
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:55,229
give it a 180 degree twist,

425
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,959
transform it into a two dimensional...

426
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,311
you are a spy for Tor.

427
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,552
Who?

428
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,834
Look, I'm trying to find someone.

429
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,230
His name is... Simon Weir.

430
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,476
Simon?

431
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,794
Yeah, you know him?

432
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,070
He is a mentor to Prince Ragis.

433
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,205
This uh... Prince Ragis

434
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,196
he's one of the good guys, right?

435
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,885
Of course.

436
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,195
Great! Just what I wanted to hear.

437
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,271
Simon Weir is my dad.

438
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:36,440
Cut him loose!

439
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,470
I've heard that the portal could bring me to other worlds...

440
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,994
I need your magic... Shepway must have taught you.

441
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,805
You see, Ragis? She refuses to help us.

442
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,354
Even though she helped those who betrayed us and her
people.

443
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,632
Maybe your little alien friend will convince you to help us.

444
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,440
No! Leave him alone!

445
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,798
This has nothing to do with Simon... Please, don't...

446
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,716
Proceed!

447
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,189
Stop! I will do it!

448
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,349
Give her the crystal.

449
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,749
So it is true.

450
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,713
Imagine the world that will bow before me!

451
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,917
With this portal, I can build an army greater than any in
the Galaxy.

452
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,069
Don't be too arrogant puny alien.

453
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,272
My forces wait my command

454
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,757
to enter your world

455
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,965
and make you our slaves.

456
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,718
How dare you talk to me like that...

457
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,110
Attack my minions.

458
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,432
Take her back to the dungeon.

459
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,192
I will be the greatest King Raffia has ever known!!

460
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,537
Ragis!? Ragis!?

461
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:02,954
Ragis!? Ragis!?

462
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,110
Did you see your father's body?

463
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,148
No, only Shepway did.

464
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,556
Shepway told us what she saw.

465
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,629
Puncture wounds. There was only one puncture wound
through Akis' chest.

466
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,439
That's impossible. Espar horns have a forked tip.

467
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,199
There would have been two puncture wounds.

468
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,190
No! Only one. From Tor's sword!

469
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,117
Noooo!!!!

470
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,712
This is an irresistible Raphiccan delicacy.

471
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,317
The brains of an Oda.

472
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,671
Oh, en, yeah It looks great, really.

473
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,834
But, uh... I'm allergic. Yeah, that's it, I'm allergic.

474
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,478
To any food product from the neck up, you know,

475
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,315
eyeballs, tongues, ears, and yes, I hate to say it, even
brains.

476
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,118
Too bad.

477
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,870
Look, Bodkus, I really appreciate the feast and
everything.

478
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
But what I really need is to find my dad.

479
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,710
Finding him isn't the problem. He resides at Tor's castle.

480
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,028
Great, Ah, let's go.

481
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,189
We were the loyal servants to the former ruler of our
kingdom, King Akis,

482
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,159
until his life was taken by the hand of his own brother...
Tor.

483
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,229
Uh huh, so I take it you and this Tor aren't exactly close.

484
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,832
We will never submit to the murderer Tor! He has defiled
the sacred teachings

485
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,550
Look, Look, I wish you all the best in your fight, I really.

486
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,029
But none of this has anything to do with my dad.

487
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,318
That is where you are wrong, my small friend.

488
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,191
Shepway taught you well.

489
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,117
What do you think you are doing?

490
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,676
Ragis!

491
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,158
Grab hold.

492
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,115
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

493
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,313
Overcoming doubts will only strengthen you.

494
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,713
It rightfully belongs with you now.

495
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,119
Maybe we should think about getting out of here?

496
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,365
Oh... of course.

497
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,075
We might be able to escape through the rear entrance.
There are fewer guards posted there.

498
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,439
No, I have a plan. We must reach the upper balcony.

499
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,537
Upper balcony?

500
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:52,154
Trust me.

501
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:07,555
King tor, Ragis freed Allana and the alien!

502
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,632
Ah..., Sound the alarm!

503
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,078
I thought you had a plan!

504
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,671
Now would be a good time to let us in on it.

505
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,989
Follow me.

506
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,190
Follow you where?

507
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,396
Over the balcony.

508
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,351
What????

509
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,709
Told you I had a plan.

510
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,029
Is Simon all right?

511
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,553
We have to go back for Simon.

512
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,834
Tor has him by now.

513
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,036
Tor's army is almost at full strength.

514
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,070
He will launch an offensive against us at the conclusion
of the Festival of Light.

515
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,519
We must mobilize the rebel troops. I will gather the
warriors.

516
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,231
We cannot launch an attack against the castle.

517
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,148
It is too well fortified.

518
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,472
We must engage Tor right here, in our territory,

519
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,359
where we control the battlefield.

520
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,030
You display the heart of an Espar, just like your father.

521
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,755
It will be my honor to serve you, King Ragis.

522
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,632
Touching. While you're getting fitted for your crown,

523
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,071
maybe you can spare a few guys to help me save my
dad.

524
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,358
Simon taught us humanity's most cherished values...

525
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,552
He helped us to understand that by embracing those
values

526
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,433
we could defy Tor.

527
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,119
But Raphicca is not my home. Ok

528
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,157
or my father's.

529
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,308
He shouldn't have to die to save it.

530
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,155
If there is any way to rescue your father,

531
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,751
Ragis will find it. Nobody loves Simon more than Ragis.

532
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,876
Oh, Really?

533
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,199
I was only talking about Raphiccans, not Simon's human
family.

534
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,957
Who'm I kidding? My dad's been gone so long

535
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,471
I don't even know him anymore. You're more his family
now than I am.

536
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,917
Nothing could be further from the truth, Jac.

537
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,190
Simon missed you and your mother...

538
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,118
Save it! Just leave me alone, will you?

539
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,913
The young human needs a friend

540
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,030
Those were your fathers chambers... in case you were
wondering.

541
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,109
Well, I wasn't.

542
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:27,919
Jac, I am deeply sorry about your father.

543
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,071
Do you?! What would you know about it?

544
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,078
Too much, I'm sad to say.

545
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,312
I never even met my father. He died when I was quite
young.

546
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,031
From the moment Simon first arrived here,

547
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,430
all he could talk about was how to get back home.

548
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,233
Did my dad... ever talk about me?

549
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,916
Every day. He would say

550
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,829
hat joy would only come to him on the day he was
reunited with you and your mother.

551
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,473
He also believed in his heart that you and I would be fast
friends.

552
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,479
I told Simon that you could be the little brother I never
had.

553
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,032
Please help me save my dad, Ragis.

554
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,950
I promise, Jac.

555
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,678
But there is no way to penetrate the castle's defenses.

556
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,830
No way for a Raphiccan maybe. But Tor never thought
about keeping humans out.

557
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,429
What do you have in mind?

558
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,678
Need some help there, Arthur?

559
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,879
My back springs aren't as young as they used to be.

560
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,916
Ooh..., My energy pack is almost drained.

561
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,116
I'm going to attempt to rescue Simon from the castle.

562
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,214
That's a suicide mission!

563
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:44,948
That's a suicide mission!

564
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,309
This is something I must do for Simon. Jac has a plan. I
believe it would work.

565
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,794
So when do we leave?

566
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,277
Bodkus, I want you to stay with the troops.

567
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:55,918
But...

568
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,633
We cannot afford in danger both of our lives. If the need
rises, you would lead all over Raphiccan.

569
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,155
Go with a light, my king.

570
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,955
Ragis, I...

571
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,590
Bodkus would need your magic. I swear I will return.

572
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,635
Ragis!...Be safe.

573
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,756
I will

574
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,039
One hundred years ago,

575
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,829
my forefathers delivered our glorious kingdom back into
the Light,

576
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,755
after the Darkness had enveloped Raphicca for eons.

577
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,197
...All right!

578
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,273
But... Raphiccans! The son of Akis has betrayed you.

579
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,876
The darkness has consumed him.

580
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,034
At this very moment, he is plotting rebellion against the
Kingdom,

581
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,513
and... He has enlisted this alien sorcerer to help him.

582
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,834
But in the proud tradition of the House of Raheem,

583
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,915
I will lead our kingdom in crushing this rebellion and
bring peace back to our lands.

584
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,990
My only recourse to defeat the growing rebel forces and
defend our freedom

585
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,999
was to rebuild the Raphiccan army.

586
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,916
Your overwhelming approval of my strategy

587
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,589
will not go unrewarded.

588
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,755
The proud army of Raphicca will emerge victorious.

589
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,111
This is my way in.

590
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,789
Now for you... You'd get a seat in that way.

591
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,511
Nice look.

592
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,116
You smell...

593
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,429
Once we annihilate the rebels and kill Prince Ragis,

594
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,670
our power over them will be absolute.

595
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,429
I have a treat for you.

596
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:11,833
Dad!...Dad, wake up

597
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,709
it's me, Jac.

598
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,439
Jac.

599
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,276
Look at you. You're all grown up.

600
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,316
Enough!

601
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,000
Find the sorcerer.

602
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,835
Enter the coordinates for the Virgo Cluster.

603
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,030
I've tried.

604
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,792
Confirm spatial differential. Far side telemetry initiated.
Connection established and secured.

605
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,351
Mom gave me this on the way to Callisto.

606
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:57,829
Jac. Simon.

607
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,196
Caroline!?

608
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,311
Mom

609
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,318
How'd you get here?

610
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,676
Jac told me the portal was practically destroyed.

611
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,476
Good thing I can read your sloppy handwriting. Your
notes.

612
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,190
I used them to rewire the portal. With Arthur's help of
course.

613
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,277
The gateway is stable, Simon. We can go home.

614
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,989
I owe you my life. And so much more.

615
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,875
On the contrary, my friend, I am in your debt.

616
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,354
Thank you for sharing your father with me, Jac.

617
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,039
We are going to miss you.

618
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,750
Fare well.

619
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,155
Tor is mobilizing his army!

620
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:16,956
We're not prepared... We need more time.

621
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,516
We're not leaving.

622
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,312
This is not your war.

623
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,560
You and your family have sacrificed far too much already.

624
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,748
Listen, big guy, on my planet families stick together.

625
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,513
Understand what I’m saying... brother?

626
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,031
Jac's right, we are one family now.

627
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,192
Now I understand.

628
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,268
Good, then let's take care of business.

629
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,552
Now!

630
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,790
Fire!

631
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,076
Fire!

632
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:05,752
Fire!

633
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,193
King Tor. They've set traps throughout the forest.

634
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,635
Is that the best they can do?

635
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,274
Release the catapults and fire the cannons.

636
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,754
Prepare the catapults.

637
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,589
Fire!

638
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,839
Charge, charge!

639
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,078
Get me down there. I'll crush them myself!

640
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,871
You have to go on without me, my king.

641
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,919
A good friend once told me,

642
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,398
Overcoming your fears only makes you stronger.

643
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,155
Today we face an enemy whose sole purpose is to
annihilate us,

644
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,835
My father and Shepway believed in the ways of the light.

645
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,276
We will not let their deaths be in vain.

646
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,276
We will fight, we will be victorious

647
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,358
We will bring our world back into the light.

648
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,471
March with me brave warriors of Raphicca Let us face
our destiny!

649
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,838
You should died by the same hand as your father did.

650
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,725
How poetic.

651
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,513
My father was murdered because he trusted you.

652
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:39,834
There will be no more killing.

653
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,509
The prophecy has come true

654
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,236
Ragis!..

655
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:31,034
Ragis, Ragis...

656
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,313
My brothers. Our Kingdom has been perverted by

657
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,517
one man's lust for power.

658
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,434
He has killed your King, his own brother,

659
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,752
to feed his lust.

660
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,312
And plunged us into darkness. Seize Tor.

661
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,353
Fools! I am commander of the armies of this Kingdom,

662
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,354
and soon I will command the armies of the universe.

663
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,320
Raphicca will kneel before me.

664
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,836
Tor has the crystal. He must not succeed.

665
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,115
Take care of Allena.

666
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,076
Ragis must not go alone.

667
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:41,798
Don't worry. He is not. Wait, Ragis.

668
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,751
Brother?

669
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,430
Brother.

670
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,916
If Raphicca's armies will not stand behind me,

671
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,510
then they shall fall before a more powerful one.

672
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,155
The future is mine.

673
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:00,836
Jack!

674
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,108
All right.

675
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,796
Can we go home now?

676
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,558
By the order of the light and the guardians of the great
realm,

677
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,674
It is my honor to bestow upon the the crown of Raphicca.

678
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,435
Wear it well, my King!!!

679
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,432
You know, I was thinking.

680
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,990
Now that we've got the Moebius Field Portal up and
running,

681
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,599
why stop here? Think about all the planets we could
check out.

682
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,914
You've got to be kidding.

683
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,795
I've been dealing with him for the last 7 years. It's your
turn now...

684
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,758
Of course, we'd all go together next time,

685
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,351
and maybe even take Arthur with us. And speaking of
Arthur...
