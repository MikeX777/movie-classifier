1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,711
That's me hanging
with my most precious gift,

2
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,550
my daughter, Maron.

3
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,955
I guess I'm a cross between
a single dad and a single mom,

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,153
and I have been
for some time now.

5
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,221
I'm privileged, I'm blessed,
I'm responsible, I'm happy.

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,130
God, I love her.

7
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,294
She's the only little girl
that I know

8
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,962
that, while playing dress-up,

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,973
wore my baseball cleats
as high heels.

10
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,872
Where's her mother?

11
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:49,244
Well, it took making this movie
to really answer that question.

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,281
I don't know,

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,749
but maybe every community,
on some level,

14
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,616
resembles Happy Valley.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:01,885
And the prescription was for,
like, 10 of these Lortab.

16
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,860
So 10 pain pills.

17
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,955
And so I thought,
"Well, you know what?

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,261
The guy just writes it
with a pen.

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,734
We'll just get a pen,

20
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,101
and we'll just change
the prescription, " you know?

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,572
And he's like,
"What do you mean?

22
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,609
We can't write another one,"
you know?

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,701
So my buddy goes,
"Well, let's just do this."

24
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,249
He took out his pen, and he's
got the actual prescription.

25
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,113
Where it says at the bottom,
"Dispense 10,"

26
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,555
he takes the 10,
and he changes the 1 to a 7.

27
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,219
So instead of getting 10,
it was 70 Lortab... <i>7. 5.</i>

28
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,625
And it looked horrible.

29
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,061
'Cause the 10 was, like,
straight up, you know?

30
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,030
And usually a 7
is kind of at an angle.

31
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,898
And so it was this... like
an upside down "L" for the 10.

32
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,938
I mean, it was horrible.
Anybody <i>could...</i>

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,735
So I'm going,
"You got to be kidding me.

34
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,968
We take this in,

35
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,169
I mean, instantly you're
gonna get caught."

36
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,643
He goes, "No.
This will work."

37
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,237
So I said, "Well, you got to be
careful where you take it."

38
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,251
So we literally shopped around
to find a pharmacy

39
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,015
where it would be the lowest
risk of getting caught.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,215
And so we went down,

41
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,656
and there was a pharmacy
in Mapleton that we found.

42
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,693
We went in there,
and there was this lady

43
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,754
that was 104 if she <i>was...</i>
I'm not kidding.

44
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,960
She actually, I think, started
pharmacies in the United States.

45
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,232
She's the first pharmacy
in Utah.

46
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,830
He goes in there
with this stupid prescription.

47
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,873
It looked horrible.

48
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,603
This lady... I don't
think she could see.

49
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,941
She goes, "Okay, well, youse
want to wait a few minutes."

50
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,947
Oh, that's quite a few
pain pills."

51
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,883
I was out in the car
just sweating, waiting.

52
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,249
He was in there
for a quite a while.

53
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,583
I thought, "He got caught."

54
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,213
I'm just waiting
for something to happen.

55
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,121
All of a sudden I see
the front door's opened.

56
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,127
He comes out going, " I told you!
She's so old, <i>she..."</i>

57
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,355
And he got 70 Lor...

58
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:49,060
And that was the start of
this whole ridiculous thing.

59
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,106
So if you were to look
at your history...

60
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,641
How many drugs have you taken?
Do you know?

61
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,234
I've probably eaten your weight
in pain pills.

62
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,277
That's a lot.

63
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,745
Well, you're not a small man.

64
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,543
And I'm just gonna say,
from this standpoint,

65
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,877
don't be afraid to miss a meal
here and there.

66
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,350
But no.

67
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,944
And that's just a health issue
more than anything.

68
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,654
I mean, I remember that one time
you and I were in Vegas.

69
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,728
You about killed me

70
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,819
when I stepped in front of you
at the buffet line.

71
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,592
There's no need for that, Ron.

72
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,896
There's plenty for everybody.
That's what it is... a buffet.

73
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,010
I've lived here most of my life.

74
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,349
And there's a lot of things
I like about it.

75
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,016
I've traveled around quite a
bit, but I've always come back.

76
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,116
I feel like it's a safe place
to raise my children.

77
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,957
It's a close-knit community.
Our neighborhood is great.

78
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,793
It just has a good feel to it.
Good atmosphere.

79
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,890
Utah's a beautiful state.

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,970
A really nice place to come to.

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,004
As they say,
"The best snow on earth."

82
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:38,738
I'm not Mormon, but I like
the values of the LDS religion.

83
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,903
I like it a lot.

84
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,844
Mostly because of the nature,
you know?

85
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:46,214
We got the mountains 10 minutes
away, the lake 2 minutes away.

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,911
It's a good place to live.

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,252
You know, it's really clean,
really nice.

88
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,258
It's a whole lot different
than back home.

89
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,203
Well, I would say
that it goes back

90
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,466
to when they first came across
the Plains and got here.

91
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,269
They wanted to build
a utopian society,

92
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,866
which is
really, really wonderful,

93
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,344
and it's the dream of every
person on the planet to do so.

94
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,347
But the problem is,

95
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,418
is in creating the Z CMI
and doing all of that,

96
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,250
they were isolated from the rest
of the world for so long that,

97
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,721
generation after generation,

98
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,815
they created and defined
their own culture.

99
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,793
Utah definitely has
a closed mind-set.

100
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,920
Definitely.

101
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,397
Very set in their ways.

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,867
And it's this way or no way.

103
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,532
The alcohol laws here
are just outrageously crazy.

104
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,202
- They make no sense.
- How do they work?

105
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,303
I mean, such as, you know,
you can walk into a bar

106
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,974
and you can't even
buy a pitcher here anymore

107
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,416
unless you have more than
three people in your group.

108
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,816
I can drink as <i>much...</i>

109
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,013
I drink a pitcher of beer,

110
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,148
and to me it's like drinking
a regular beer to a small guy.

111
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,421
We're sheltered,
but I'm not naive enough to say

112
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,429
that we have no drugs,
we have no gangs,

113
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,897
that we don't have our issues.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,027
We were the first black family
in our neighborhood.

115
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,765
And, I mean, seriously,

116
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,842
the kids would come over
to look at us, you know?

117
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,808
And the little boy
asked my little brother,

118
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,378
"Doesn't that wash off?"

119
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,914
I do think that
there's a problem with denial

120
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,142
with the drug use
that happens here.

121
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,775
I grew up here.

122
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,148
I've gone through
the school system.

123
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,482
I also teach in Las Vegas.

124
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,454
And I think
the big difference is

125
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,525
people down there
are willing to face and admit

126
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,288
that there's a lot of things
going on around them,

127
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,387
where here sometimes, I think,

128
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,296
people don't want to believe
that their community

129
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,368
could have a problem
with that kind of stuff.

130
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,870
And therein lies a lot of what
the problem is, in all honesty.

131
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,932
It comes to mind that there is
a significant problem

132
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,410
and that a lot of people
are pretending not to know

133
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,879
that there is a problem.

134
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,041
There's a part of me
that wants to say that

135
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,584
there's no way it can happen

136
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:04,088
because of our religious beliefs
and the way we raise our kids.

137
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,250
Yeah, there is an issue with
denial in terms of drug abuse.

138
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,090
And it's really hard,
especially in our culture,

139
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,562
especially with
our religious beliefs,

140
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:17,398
how that's looked down upon,
that kind <i>of...</i>

141
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,300
It's really hard for people,
I'm sure,

142
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,203
that deal
with drug-abuse issues,

143
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,105
because they don't know
how to overcome it,

144
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,370
and they don't know where to go.

145
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,843
They don't want to talk about it

146
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,244
because they feel embarrassed
or guilty.

147
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,906
Well, to be honest with you,

148
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,986
I just got released
from jail today, okay?

149
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,611
I was in jail
on a marijuana charge.

150
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:41,091
And that was two years ago,
and I just avoided it till now.

151
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,117
While I was in there,

152
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,962
I saw major heroin
and cocaine withdrawals

153
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,058
from probably 40 inmates there.

154
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,468
So I would definitely say
that's a major influence now.

155
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,667
The methadone, the heroin,
the OxyContins.

156
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,505
It <i>is...</i>
That's the thing.

157
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,876
It's a pill thing.
It's not your normal street.

158
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,573
So that's one of
the difficulties.

159
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,050
And I think there's a part of
Utah County that wants to say,

160
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,586
"No.
That doesn't exist."

161
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,054
The reality of it is,
it's horrible here.

162
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,385
Horrible.

163
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,356
Let's see.

164
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,021
This is still Christmas Day.

165
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,966
I had the digital camera,
so I took this picture.

166
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,504
Right after I took that picture,

167
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:31,543
I saw this little quirk
of a smile.

168
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:42,053
These pictures are all taken
Christmas Day 2004.

169
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,553
That would <i>be...</i>

170
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,293
<i>...the</i> last Christmas
before she died.

171
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,702
When she was little, it was
just like a rope tied to her.

172
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,465
And everywhere Mom went,
Amelia went.

173
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,165
<i>And...</i>

174
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,340
I don't know
that she ever got over that.

175
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,433
She always understood...

176
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,447
We never had battles
or fights or anything.

177
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,451
We always just, as Michael said,
we just got along beautifully.

178
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,077
She got her driver's license.

179
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,553
We wanted to go buy...
She wanted to get a car.

180
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,058
So we started going
car shopping.

181
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,689
Well, the car she liked
was a little Mazda Protege,

182
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,666
and it had
a <i>5-</i> speed transmission.

183
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,364
And teaching her how to drive
a manual transmission

184
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,167
was an experience.

185
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,670
It took us
probably a week or two

186
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,178
to get where
she was really comfortable

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,145
and felt good about it.

188
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
- What?
- Two days.

189
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,479
And I was the one who taught her
how to drive with a stick shift.

190
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,424
Yes.
She caught on very quickly.

191
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,190
But the thing
that was interesting is,

192
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,764
she wrecked that car.

193
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,095
We met in ninth grade.

194
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,635
And we actually...
I remember meeting her.

195
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,705
We were in French class.

196
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,569
And we <i>were...</i>

197
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,544
We ended up becoming partners
for something.

198
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,669
I forgot what it was.

199
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,273
But we just loved each other
right from the start.

200
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,318
If one of us
were walking down the hallway,

201
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,080
and they didn't see
the other one with us,

202
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,348
they'd be, "Where's Amelia?"

203
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,048
Or "Where's Macall?"

204
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,649
And we were just inseparable.
We were always together.

205
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,128
Amelia loved Macall.

206
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,358
She just loved Macall.

207
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,394
I n fact, one of the last things
we said to Amelia...

208
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,372
Michael was joking with her
and said,

209
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,773
"Don't you think you've seen
enough of Macall this weekend?"

210
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,811
And I said that, and she said,

211
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,370
"You can't ever
get enough of Macall."

212
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,213
And that was the last thing
she said to me.

213
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,787
We didn't plan on using drugs
or anything.

214
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,551
But I ended up
talking to Amelia,

215
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,456
and I told her that my parents

216
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,152
were going out of town
for the weekend.

217
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,823
And she said that she had...
She wanted to get high.

218
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,265
And she wanted to use heroin.

219
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,270
And I told her,
"Okay, well, I can get it."

220
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,363
I saw the two girls,
and I <i>said...</i>

221
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:20,571
And I had a bad feeling.
And I remember <i>saying...</i>

222
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,170
I <i>was...</i>

223
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,409
I just was worried about Macall
for some reason.

224
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,679
And I called Amelia up,
and I said,

225
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,345
"Amelia, will you make sure

226
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,116
that Macall doesn't do
any more drugs.

227
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,249
I'm really worried about her,
that she's gonna die."

228
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,454
And Amelia said, "Yeah.
I'll make sure of that."

229
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,430
We had asked Amelia
several times

230
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,467
about Macall and her drugs.

231
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,399
Amelia said
that she was doing fine,

232
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,837
that she was being tested,
and she was clean.

233
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,570
And everything seemed
to be going well.

234
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,408
She just used used them
recreationally.

235
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,711
She would use them once
in a while at parties <i>and...</i>

236
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,683
Or when she and I were together.

237
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,755
That whole weekend
was her first time shooting up.

238
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,687
It was the first time
using syringes.

239
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,420
All I remember is just
teaching her how to shoot up.

240
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,190
And then I shot up.

241
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,425
And that's it.

242
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,262
And then I ended up
going downstairs

243
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,700
because I wanted to be
with my boyfriend.

244
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,931
Macall had a boyfriend
who did not do drugs at all.

245
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,770
I don't know how he didn't know
Macall was doing them.

246
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,505
It's almost impossible
for him not to have known.

247
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,240
LDS.
I n the Church.

248
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,906
I'm an Eagle Scout.

249
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,749
Good kid in school.
Got good grades.

250
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,311
Averaged a 3. 3 GPA.
Played football.

251
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,822
Just a normal, you <i>know...</i>

252
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,518
Normal good kid
with no drug involvements.

253
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,424
Did you ever sense
that she was on drugs?

254
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,461
I asked her.

255
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,498
I'm like, "What's the worst
thing you've ever done?"

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,465
Like, "How many drugs
have you done?"

257
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,968
Just to find out.
And she didn't lie to me at all.

258
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,266
She said, " I've pretty much
tried everything.

259
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,934
But that's in my past,
and I'm moving forward."

260
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,877
It's gonna be a mystery that
we will never be able to solve.

261
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,541
Because we honestly thought

262
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,383
that Macall had gotten over
the drugs.

263
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,855
You know, Amelia was there
trying to help her.

264
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,325
And somehow,
for whatever reason,

265
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,955
she turns around
and pulls Amelia...

266
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,500
gets Amelia
to go right down with her.

267
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,376
This came from the police...

268
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,842
and so we kind of assume

269
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,847
that it has to be
there's some fact to it...

270
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:42,353
that Macall and Amelia
took heroin.

271
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,787
Macall injected Amelia
because Amelia couldn't do it.

272
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,449
When you overdose,

273
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,892
you usually do it
right there and then.

274
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,021
Because I've overdosed myself.

275
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,431
She never told me
that she was sick.

276
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,560
She never told me
that she felt anything.

277
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,229
She just seemed like
she was fine.

278
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,364
We had perfectly normal
conversations.

279
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,203
And so I just left her upstairs.

280
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,868
And then about 3:00 or 4:00
in the morning,

281
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,880
Macall and her boyfriend
came upstairs

282
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,314
and found Amelia passed out
on the kitchen floor.

283
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,477
You know, then she started
breathing a little funny.

284
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,714
I'm like, "We should
seriously call somebody."

285
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,483
You know, she's unconscious.

286
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,855
We can't even get her
to respond to anything.

287
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,485
She's like, "No, it'll be okay.
She'll be okay."

288
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,690
I felt <i>for...</i>
I <i>just...</i>

289
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,927
The feeling
that I had inside <i>was...</i>

290
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,401
It was just so awful.

291
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,405
Just seeing my friend
on the floor.

292
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:40,638
And Jasen said,
"We ought to call 911."

293
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,805
And Macall said no.

294
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,780
I was scared to death.

295
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,909
Never seen someone like that
in my life.

296
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,886
Not knowing what's wrong and not
knowing it's a drug overdose.

297
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,082
You know, not knowing
how to help this person.

298
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,558
Yeah, calling 911,
that was my first thing,

299
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,719
but I was told not to.

300
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,491
And, so, trying to help them
the best I could.

301
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,728
It's scary just not getting
a response out of a person,

302
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,532
'cause never seen that before,
and you see it all of a sudden.

303
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,073
It's just like, what do you do?

304
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,540
I thought that
she was gonna come back.

305
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,442
I thought she was gonna come to.
<i>And...</i>

306
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,846
She... We ended up moving her
over to the couch 'cause...

307
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,976
And we fell asleep beside her.

308
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,849
And the next morning,
we woke up,

309
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,583
and she was blue and black
in the face.

310
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,093
She was gone.

311
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,134
After that,

312
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:49,977
I'm not sure exactly what took
place between Macall and Jasen.

313
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,540
They decided that
they had to get rid of the body.

314
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,517
They took her body
up to the "Bountiful"...

315
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,613
up by the "B" in "Bountiful"...
and tried to hide it.

316
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,048
Buried it.

317
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,427
Tried to cover it with weeds
and twigs and all those things.

318
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,033
And then Tuesday came,
and we had...

319
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,038
All of the news media were here
Tuesday morning

320
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,472
wanting to talk about
what was going on.

321
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,873
<i>And...</i>

322
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,075
<i>...</i> someone said, "Did you know
they found a body?"

323
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,850
And I just thought,
"Well, that's it, then.

324
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:36,155
I don't need to talk anymore
on the TV, because that's it.

325
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,161
She's gone."

326
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:44,224
And soon after that,
South Jordan police came.

327
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:50,764
And he sat down.
And we took each other's hand.

328
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,504
And the officer
looked at me, and he said...

329
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,671
- It was a chaplain.
- Chaplain.

330
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,544
Looked at me, and he said,

331
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,016
"We found Amelia.
She's dead."

332
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,547
And the shock and the horror

333
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:11,527
of hearing what you knew
you were gonna hear,

334
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,124
but you just kept hoping
against hope you wouldn't hear.

335
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:21,832
The shock is so painful
that you can't move.

336
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,604
And you just sit there
as this wave goes down.

337
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,077
Starts at the top
of your head

338
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,081
and goes down
through your whole body

339
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,583
like an electric shock.

340
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,783
And then he showed us
her picture.

341
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,989
<i>And...</i>

342
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:47,021
<i>...</i> her face was swollen
and bruised.

343
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,124
And I found out later
they had touched up the photo

344
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,171
so it wasn't as bad
as what it really was.

345
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,475
And you're just going,
"What happened?

346
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,513
What happened to Amelia?

347
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,912
Why does her face
look like that?"

348
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,049
They couldn't tell me.
They didn't say anything.

349
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:15,491
It was weeks... weeks...
before the medical <i>examiner...</i>

350
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,085
It was August.
Second week in August.

351
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:22,258
But the police told us kind of
what happened a week later.

352
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,803
"She died peacefully
on the couch, " they said.

353
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,963
You don't die peacefully
on the couch

354
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,668
and have this horrendous wound
on your head.

355
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,907
She would have had to recover
from a concussion had she lived.

356
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,279
The medical examiner said
it could have been caused

357
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,874
by when she passed out.

358
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,147
Hitting the kitchen floor.

359
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,816
I think it was caused
by something entirely different.

360
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,916
The cops ended up
coming to my house,

361
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,793
and they asked me to submit
to a lie-detector test.

362
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,195
And I said I would.

363
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,029
Monday night she told me,
"What do you want me to do?"

364
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,263
'Cause she had to go in
to take a lie-detector's test.

365
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,100
I told her that night,
"Just tell them."

366
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,764
I'm like,
"Just tell them the truth.

367
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,172
I can't take this anymore."

368
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,574
I'm like,
"This is killing me inside."

369
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,646
And I guess...
I don't know if she did or not.

370
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,183
And then Tuesday, early morning,
I couldn't take it anymore.

371
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,979
I called my mom.
I told her everything.

372
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,646
And I ended up going in
and just turning myself in

373
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,915
and telling the whole story.

374
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,253
So here's the big question,
Jasen.

375
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,624
What do you take responsibility
for from that night?

376
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,720
Everything.
All my actions I did.

377
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,924
I know what I did was wrong.
Absolutely.

378
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,695
I'm not gonna try to deny
anything I did was right.

379
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,997
There's no way
I can justify that.

380
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,701
And then the next morning
when I was supposed to go,

381
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,175
I had woke up and I told my dad
the entire story

382
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,406
about everything
that had happened.

383
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,681
I just remember being
so sick <i>because...</i>

384
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,085
And so sad.

385
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,317
I was so scared to tell my dad
about what had happened.

386
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,622
I was just in a state of shock.

387
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,720
And he ended up crying.

388
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,322
He told me
he couldn't believe it.

389
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,370
He called my lawyer,
and he came to the house.

390
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,201
And I had to tell him the whole
story about what had happened.

391
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,142
And then the police came, and
they searched the whole house.

392
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,008
They dusted
the whole house down.

393
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,344
And they ended up arresting me,
and I went to jail.

394
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,655
And I remember the whole thing
being on the news

395
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,991
and seeing it while
I was being booked into jail.

396
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,430
And I was so scared.
Scared to death.

397
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,441
I wasn't thinking.

398
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,776
I was completely lost.
I <i>was...</i>

399
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,146
I was so high.

400
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,513
I did not make good decisions
at all that night.

401
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,357
I wish so badly that I could
rewind the whole thing

402
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,430
and bring back my friend.

403
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,856
Since I've been in prison,

404
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,560
my father hasn't
written me letters.

405
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,070
I've written him.

406
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:51,074
I don't know if he's out of town
or if he's angry at me.

407
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,268
I don't know.

408
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,810
What would you say to your dad

409
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,402
If you could talk to your dad
right now?

410
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,947
What would you say?

411
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,845
If I could talk to my dad,
I would tell him how sorry I am.

412
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,254
And how I want nothing more
than to make him proud.

413
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,238
Do you believe
that Amelia did drugs before?

414
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,205
Do I believe
she did drugs before?

415
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,007
Before that night?

416
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,378
Hard drugs?

417
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,509
No, she never did
any hard drugs.

418
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,817
We know that she had smoked
some marijuana.

419
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,883
We know that she had done
some Ecstasy when she was...

420
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,485
when her and Macall
were sophomores.

421
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,293
We know that that took place.

422
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,130
Amelia told us,
and we had talked about it.

423
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,833
And we thought that
that part of her life was over.

424
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,931
<i>So...</i>

425
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,068
And it was.

426
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,770
Yeah.
I mean, as far as... Yeah.

427
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,905
I think Macall planned it.

428
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,346
Like I said,
it was the first time

429
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,247
she'd been alone in the house.

430
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,911
And when Jasen wanted to call,

431
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,922
she came up
with all these reasons

432
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,185
why Jasen
couldn't possibly call.

433
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,222
For four hours
Amelia lay there,

434
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,630
struggling to breathe,

435
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,830
fighting for life
even though she was unconscious.

436
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,567
And neither one of them
lifted a <i>finger...</i>

437
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,208
<i>...to</i> save her.

438
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,542
How do you feel
about Macall now?

439
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,151
I don't think Macall has a soul.

440
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,348
I don't know who or what she is.

441
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,392
I call her one of the undead.

442
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,585
She doesn't have a soul.

443
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,993
She doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

444
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,192
I was told that after...

445
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,168
When Jasen found Amelia dead,

446
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,136
the only thing
Macall could think of...

447
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,433
She didn't grieve.

448
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,979
She didn't say, "Oh, dear"
or "Oh, my" or "Oh, Amelia."

449
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,843
She said, "We've got to get
this body out of this house

450
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,576
before my dad gets home."

451
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,145
Heroin or opiates
or those types of the OxyContins

452
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,545
can be reversed.

453
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,677
Overdoses can be reversed
with drugs that paramedics keep.

454
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,489
They can be virtually
brought back to life

455
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,222
by using Narcan and different
things that paramedics have.

456
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,289
Heroin is a central
nervous system depressant.

457
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,597
It basically shuts down
various functions of the brain.

458
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,936
It is not going to be
that spectacular.

459
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,407
I mean...
And it's easy to miss it.

460
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,038
You know, this person may
just sort of nod off <i>and...</i>

461
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,608
You know,
unless you're paying attention

462
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,050
to see if they're breathing,

463
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,418
they may just look like they're
happily passed out on the couch.

464
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,685
We're dealing with good kids.
Normal kids.

465
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,589
Kids that
you never would imagine

466
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,288
getting into a drug environment.

467
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,663
And they're starting out
experimenting with small things

468
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
that usually leads them
into a direction

469
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,598
they never would have
seen themselves.

470
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,196
I'd sit down
with parents and say,

471
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,242
"These are the things
that you need to look for

472
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,674
in this kind of a drug problem."

473
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,975
Show them what the paraphernalia
looks like and describe it.

474
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,606
Usually a parent can get up
and walk in the kid's room

475
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,618
and come out with a handful
of that kind of stuff.

476
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,585
Marijuana pipe.
Kind of cutesy.

477
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:04,424
This pot pipe was actually made
at a high school shop.

478
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,555
Zig-Zags for rolling marijuana.
Very common.

479
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,658
A small scale
for the personal drug user

480
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,737
who wants to make sure
that he's not getting shorted.

481
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,532
Crack pipe or crank pipe.

482
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,133
These little glass vials you can
actually buy at a 7-Eleven.

483
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,702
And if you look
at the front of the desk,

484
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,580
there's these little roses
inside a glass vial.

485
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,983
They're not selling the rose.

486
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,021
They're selling a crack pipe.

487
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,589
Do you have
any light bulbs missing?

488
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,216
How about spoons?

489
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,421
These are things I didn't know.
I had spoons come up missing.

490
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,088
I'm like, "What's going on here?

491
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,290
My kids aren't little anymore."
You know?

492
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,163
Cellphone bills.
Gasoline.

493
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,668
You know?
How much gas are they using?

494
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,829
How many miles are they putting
on their car?

495
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,777
My son designed this tattoo

496
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,506
because he wanted to be
a tattoo artist

497
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,140
and own a tattoo parlor
at one time.

498
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,717
So I went
and had a tattoo put on.

499
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,309
This is supposed to be C. B. B.,

500
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,981
but I think it's a little
infected at the moment.

501
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,559
This picture was taken
in Africa.

502
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,063
We had it blown up
and had it down at his wake.

503
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,827
I mean, we had a celebration of
his life rather than a funeral.

504
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,334
<i>And...</i>

505
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,572
There was every kind
of kid and parent there.

506
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,474
From all walks of life.
From <i>all...</i>

507
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,548
Every different kind
of dress <i>and...</i>

508
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,514
<i>...</i> every different kind
of parent.

509
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,145
That's what he taught us,
though,

510
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,554
is acceptance, you know?

511
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,789
He just wanted people
to be accepted for who they are

512
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,160
and how they were
or how they dressed.

513
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,425
Somebody who uses drugs

514
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,195
isn't just hanging out
in a dark corner

515
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,530
with just a few people,
you know?

516
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,264
It can be anybody.

517
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,108
We were actually in Phoenix.

518
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,540
We had gotten back from Africa,

519
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,703
and we'd left him home alone
to be with his sister.

520
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,373
She was watching him,
and David and I were in Phoenix.

521
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,316
And he had gone to work that
night, was supposed to be home.

522
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,479
And Brianne got a phone call.

523
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,522
He didn't come home at noon?
Or midnight.

524
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,353
He was supposed to be home
by midnight.

525
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,452
And apparently he had bought
some cocaine the night before

526
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,292
with a group of kids.

527
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,700
He had driven to Sugarhouse
and bought a rock.

528
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,635
He came home alone,

529
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,536
did the coke
for whatever reason.

530
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,371
What made him do it, why he
wanted to do it that <i>night...</i>

531
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,310
'Cause we thought he was
pretty drug-free at that point.

532
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:40,646
And he brought it home,
did it himself at home.

533
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,810
He was alone.

534
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,820
He got in the bathtub.

535
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:49,258
They said maybe the heat on top
of the coke took his life.

536
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,294
They found him in the bathtub.

537
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,591
Found him
in the upstairs bathroom.

538
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,798
Just white as a sheet.

539
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,737
And I knew when I first saw him
that he was gone.

540
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:07,175
And my son and Bree
were out in the car.

541
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,643
The hardest thing
I've ever had to do

542
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,706
was go out and tell Bree
that her brother had died.

543
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,651
Our son was Colton Ben Berger.

544
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,452
Born on April 8, 1989.

545
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,426
He passed away of
an accidental overdose of drugs

546
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,760
on January 28, 2006.

547
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:36,772
I think his real aspiration
in life was to help people.

548
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,170
And he'll <i>never...</i>

549
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,575
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,738
<i>...</i> have the chance to do that.

551
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,548
I could probably walk into
any high school in this state

552
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,923
and find it within five minutes.

553
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,496
You know, the problem is,
is that everybody's doing them.

554
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,656
Kids that were the stoners.
People in band.

555
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,358
Computer nerds.
The football team.

556
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,368
You know, just normal,
unsuspecting kids

557
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,802
that you just expect to be
good high school students

558
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,568
that were all on
these crazy drugs.

559
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,540
I have yet to find
a high school,

560
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,407
public or private,

561
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,878
that does not have
drugs accessible

562
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,508
and that there is not
active drug use going on.

563
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,348
If you were a new student
in a new high school,

564
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,685
and you really wanted
to find any of these drugs,

565
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,418
I would bet that
it would take you

566
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,357
just a matter of hours.

567
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,952
When this was going on, I said,
"We're gonna change schools.

568
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,429
It's just that simple."

569
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,727
And he said, "You know, Dad,

570
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,828
you can get drugs anywhere,
anytime you want."

571
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,511
This person writes,
"Your life brought us life.

572
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,050
Hope you're running naked
in heaven.

573
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,052
I love you and miss you.
Kyle."

574
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,955
I'll eat my hat
if I find the drug addict

575
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,548
that's not addicted to sugar.

576
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,719
If you are always
on a high-sugar food,

577
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,854
you know that if
you're a little depressed

578
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,829
and a little blue
and a little tired,

579
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,594
all you have to go
is eat a bunch of M & M's

580
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:49,662
and a lot of soda pop, with
caffeine in it, if possible.

581
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,938
And so you're already training
your body to look at food

582
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,776
as a pharmaceutical way
to whip a dead horse.

583
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:02,478
And I think the next stage
might be prescription drugs.

584
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,578
And I think we need
to look at it.

585
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,487
I think we're a nation
in deep, deep distress.

586
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,426
If we want to truly help
drug addicts,

587
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,054
I think we need to look
at the nutritional aspect.

588
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,760
Is it the mind or the body?
I think it's both.

589
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,635
And a body will not work well
with poor food.

590
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,401
I personally almost
became addicted to painkillers

591
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,533
when I got hurt.

592
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:30,376
Because 2:00 in the morning,
it numbs your emotional pain,

593
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,743
as well as your physical pain.

594
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,714
And then as
the physical pain lessens,

595
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,514
the emotional pain
can pretty much stay the same.

596
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,385
And, you know, that pill makes
the emotional pain go away.

597
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,855
I had a really good doctor,

598
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,950
and he probably stopped me
just a couple pills away

599
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,029
from becoming addicted
to the painkillers.

600
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,962
So now I have to be really,
really careful with them.

601
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,900
And now I prefer...
Food is my addiction of choice.

602
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,630
How does that work for you?

603
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,103
Well,
from a disability standpoint,

604
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,605
it's a major drawback.

605
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,006
Because it makes everything
I have to do more difficult

606
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,739
'cause I'm trying to move a
large body with just half my...

607
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,405
with just my arms.

608
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,005
And, so, I love my food.

609
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,984
I n a way, it's my best friend,
and it's my worst enemy.

610
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,769
You know, when I walk in,
and I see 20 different <i>people...</i>

611
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,676
And to me, they're just
20 different people.

612
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,680
But when you start
to get to know them,

613
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,010
they're 20 people you love.

614
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,108
And they're all so different.

615
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,017
And if that could be
outside of here,

616
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,990
we wouldn't feel
so rotten about ourselves.

617
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,957
And the guilt.

618
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,097
There was a time
I ruined a business,

619
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,964
moved back in with my parents.

620
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,061
So now and then,
I'd go get a hotel room.

621
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,732
Just so I could go drink.

622
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,775
And I remember one time

623
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,038
feeling so guilty
about what I was doing,

624
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,613
I couldn't sleep
in the hotel room.

625
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,908
I went out and slept
in my truck.

626
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,075
'Cause I didn't feel I deserved
to sleep on that bed,

627
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,709
with the TV and all that.

628
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,014
Where does that come from?

629
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,713
The upbringing here?
What is it?

630
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,154
Oh, definitely.

631
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,855
You know, Happy Valley
and Guilt Valley.

632
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,658
I mean, the guilt <i>is...</i>

633
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,563
My sister has moved
to California,

634
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,159
and she won't come back
because of it.

635
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:37,833
She doesn't want to be judged
for every little thing she does.

636
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,639
I think everybody in this state
needs to look in the mirror

637
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,714
and quit looking
through the windows.

638
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,739
You'd be surprised
how much gas this uses

639
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,075
and how much...
we'll call him "Greg"...

640
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,671
how much gas his car uses.

641
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,151
I don't know if you can see him
up in his car,

642
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,278
but Greg's got one of these
little weighted deals.

643
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,050
And when you're sick
and you're anticipating going up

644
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,682
and getting drugs or whatever,

645
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,990
he takes his little deal

646
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,894
and he does
these reverse tricep curls

647
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,365
to take his mind
off this whole process

648
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,730
of being sick and going up.

649
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,602
It's just something to do to
keep you occupied kind of thing.

650
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,108
Because I'll meet him sometimes,
and he's just...

651
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,613
I mean, just shaking.
Just shaking like a leaf.

652
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,980
When I'm out of
doctor-prescribed pain medicine,

653
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,111
then I'll have to go a few days
or a week or whatever

654
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,917
of doing this, you know?

655
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,024
And so it'll <i>be...</i>

656
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,757
You know, we'll come up,
and then we won't be up here

657
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,699
for another, you know,
maybe a week or two.

658
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,965
And then there's been
times where, you know,

659
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:19,065
I've had enough pain medicine
to get off of the other stuff

660
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,010
and gone a month
without the other.

661
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,580
And then you run out of that,

662
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,205
and then you get sucked
right back into it

663
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,910
because you just can't break
that cycle of being sick

664
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,317
and getting off of opiates,
you know?

665
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,622
Maybe I always haven't been
the best husband,

666
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,852
but my kids love me.

667
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,020
If somebody were
to take me today, you know,

668
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,325
one thing that I do know
will be said about me is that

669
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,263
"the guy was
a really great dad."

670
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,198
And that's one thing
I'm absolutely proud of.

671
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,292
That's what I live for.

672
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,929
I think the biggest toll
that it's taken,

673
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,871
just if you want to
look at financially,

674
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:54,706
is losing about
a $500, 000-a-year job

675
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,972
because of my addiction.

676
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,206
Just going out there

677
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,842
and either running out
of medication to take

678
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,147
and getting so sick
that I couldn't perform my job.

679
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,518
And then kind of
getting labeled that way

680
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,214
and people not wanting
to take a risk

681
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,054
on somebody that has a problem

682
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,856
and will have somebody else
in here that is not a high risk.

683
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,362
So it's had a huge effect.

684
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,295
When my kids get up
early in the morning

685
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,798
after sleeping well at night

686
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,165
and I've been up all night
'cause I don't sleep well,

687
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,330
and they're bouncing off the
walls and excited to do stuff,

688
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,136
and I don't have the energy to
get up and do stuff with them...

689
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,767
Are you kidding me?

690
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,139
You know how much that sucks

691
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,180
to have them wondering,
"What's wrong with Dad?

692
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,044
Why can't he come out
and do stuff with us?"

693
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,275
Once you get to that point,

694
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,215
you will do anything
to get out of it.

695
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,752
Anything.

696
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,947
We called one of these places

697
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,321
for detox and rehab
and all that, you know?

698
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,088
And some of them
are pretty pricey.

699
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,256
And you got to go in there with
money up front and all of this.

700
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,766
And so I honestly did not know
what to do.

701
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,029
Is it cheaper to stay on drugs?

702
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,332
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

703
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,966
Not only, I mean, just the
financial side of things.

704
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,805
You can have a pretty bad habit

705
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,243
and do it
relatively inexpensively.

706
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,679
Or, I mean, thousands
and thousands of dollars

707
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,910
for detox and rehab
and all that.

708
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,420
And, unfortunately,
a lot of these places,

709
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,251
they don't work for people

710
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,052
because they go in
with the wrong reasons.

711
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,389
And especially in this valley,
there's this mentality that,

712
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,861
if somebody's got a problem,
we'll drop them off and say,

713
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,022
"Make them better,
and we'll be back in a bit."

714
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,101
You know?
And it doesn't work that way.

715
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,192
So we come out
of the gas station.

716
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,431
We've been praying, looking for
an answer what to do.

717
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,235
I see this sign..."Addicted?
<i>Drugs...</i> Prescriptions?

718
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,972
We sponsor recovery!
Happy Valley. Confidential."

719
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,173
So I come out.

720
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,749
Come out of the gas station

721
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,751
after literally having been
fighting with my wife,

722
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,185
praying what can I do,
and I see this sign that says,

723
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,450
"Happy Valley Detox.
Confidential."

724
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,289
And on the way up to the city,

725
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,887
was on my cellphone
calling your number.

726
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,559
People realize that,
"You know what?

727
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,966
I've been so stressed
or I feel so much pressure,

728
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,006
and when I take this or that,
I feel a lot better,

729
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,234
and I'm able to deal with things
a little bit better."

730
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,901
Now you're stepping over
the boundaries

731
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,876
of taking it for reasons of pain

732
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:14,246
to reasons of depression or
pressure or stress or anxiety.

733
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,049
And then it's like now you're
just taking them for any reason.

734
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,918
You get to the point
where you don't know

735
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,254
whether you're taking pain
medicine because you got pain,

736
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,022
or whether your mind's
manufacturing the pain,

737
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,859
or whether you're just taking it
to take it, you know?

738
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,365
And you get to a point
where it is out of control.

739
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,028
It's absolutely out of control.

740
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,071
"So, Sister Andersen,
could I <i>get..."</i>

741
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,943
"Could I get some of
those antidepressants?"

742
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,172
"Sister Andersen, I need
some Valium, Percocet,

743
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,544
and four balloons of black,
please."

744
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,915
"Okay, I'll see you tonight.
Are you bringing jello <i>or..."</i>

745
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,559
"Listen, you old piece of...
This isn't what I paid for.

746
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,127
I said 10 Valium.

747
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,595
I'll be at the Bishop's house
tonight if you...

748
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,097
That's more like it.
Okay.

749
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,326
Don't ever try to short me,
<i>you..."</i>

750
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,967
Can you imagine?

751
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,667
Thanks for writing me
on my mission.

752
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,904
I would never bad-mouth or say
anything bad about the Church.

753
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,505
I live for the Church.
It's my guide. I love it.

754
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,017
But there are...

755
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,984
There's...

756
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,455
You can't single out the Church.

757
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,288
It's not like it's
a Church problem, you know?

758
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,852
But are there certain pressures
that go along with the Church,

759
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,432
with religion,
with any religion?

760
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,468
But it just happens
that in Happy Valley,

761
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,094
there's a dominant religion,
you know?

762
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,673
But, I mean,
there's no way I would dog

763
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,935
and sit there and say,
"This is a Church problem."

764
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,135
It's not.
It's... You know.

765
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,542
Is there pressure
that goes along

766
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,639
with always trying to be perfect
and do everything right

767
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,914
and being in denial
and not wanting to come clean

768
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,113
when you really got a problem,

769
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,689
and, you know, talk about people
that just have...

770
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,588
I mean, domestic-violence
problems and marital problems

771
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,457
and never even come clean with
that kind of crap, you know?

772
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,428
So it's not... Yeah.
It's not a Church problem.

773
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,624
Okay, where'd he go?

774
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,633
You think there's a chance
we <i>could...</i>

775
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,533
- He's back.
- <i>...</i> help him with recovery?

776
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,162
He wants to, and he said...

777
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,673
He goes, " I don't want to do
this and expose myself

778
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,472
and have my parents see this,
you know,

779
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,309
if I'm not doing something
to get help."

780
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,110
You know, so he really does.

781
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:29,516
If you can just not start,
you know.

782
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,418
Because once you start
and you get into this lifestyle

783
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,615
and you get into taking stuff,

784
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,160
it'll take... You will...
There's no good outcome.

785
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,024
There's...
I don't know.

786
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,621
If you look around, there's
not too many old addicts.

787
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,757
They're gone.

788
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,235
You either get better
or you die.

789
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,430
That's it.

790
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,632
There's no heroin or cocaine
in Utah.

791
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,676
This is Utah. You can't get
heroin and cocaine in Utah.

792
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,075
That's what they do...
cocaine and heroin.

793
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,340
They won't deal
in anything else.

794
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,439
No meth, nothing like that.

795
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,212
They say meth makes people loco,
so they won't deal with that.

796
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,411
Find that interesting.

797
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,580
They won't deal with guys
that are speeders.

798
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,213
Yeah, because they're crazy.

799
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,155
Yeah, they'll do anything.

800
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,285
What do you want to do?

801
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,192
You want to go back
and see his pad?

802
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,128
- Greg, can we go back?
- Nah. Right now?

803
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,756
Let's go see the bachelor pad.

804
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,425
No, 'cause if you show my room,

805
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,266
anyone that knows me
is gonna know it's me.

806
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,340
Well, no.
Yeah, but we won't show it

807
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,305
until you decide what it is
you want to do.

808
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,639
Just so we have it.

809
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,474
That's the whole idea.

810
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,741
I mean, if you really do
want to change it, get help.

811
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,282
I mean, that's the reality.
That's where you live.

812
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,750
You can do it. You don't have
to, but I think it just...

813
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,447
If you really
do want to help people

814
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,116
and show them
"Here is the ultimate,"

815
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,092
from having everything
and a family,

816
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:48,187
to my whole life is in
one room, you know?

817
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,494
I want to get high
as soon as I get home.

818
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,693
You hear that?

819
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,703
He goes, " I want to get high as
soon as I get home, though."

820
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,670
- That's fine.
- Okay.

821
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,834
You want to roll?
Okay.

822
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,341
No, I got to tell you.

823
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,972
Just from my standpoint,

824
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,015
I can't tell you
how proud I am of him

825
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,484
for having as much of a problem
and saying, "You know what?

826
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,182
I'm willing to expose myself,"
'cause he's embarrassed.

827
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,315
He feels absolutely horrible
about where he is,

828
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,451
what he's given up, you know?

829
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:22,260
But like you all said,
if we can just help somebody

830
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,631
not go the same route
that he has, you know?

831
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,500
Say you lose all your money,
or say you lose your family,

832
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,769
say you lose whatever,
and you get in Greg's situation,

833
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,740
well, you'd think that he would

834
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,176
want to do anything
to get out of it, right?

835
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,305
Living in that crappy
little room of his?

836
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,077
Well, he'll tell you himself,
it's like, "Why?

837
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,119
Why go through the effort?

838
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,280
I've already lost everything.
I can't lose anything more."

839
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,632
It's probably tripping for you,
too.

840
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,601
You've never been around
this kind of stuff, have you?

841
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,796
No?

842
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,066
No, not none of that.
<i>Just...</i>

843
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,234
Was that a trip going...
going on that ride?

844
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,812
- Not really.
- I didn't notice anything.

845
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,437
Yeah, just gonna film.

846
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,743
Just filming.
Concentrating on filming.

847
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,751
There's some heroin right there.

848
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,218
How long have you lived here?

849
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,686
Four years.

850
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,222
I've been divorced
for four years

851
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,554
and been in this room
pretty much.

852
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,151
I just hide.
Hide from reality.

853
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,730
Just go get my heroin
and come back and hide.

854
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,322
And you know?

855
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,494
I got married, stayed clean,
broke my back,

856
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,696
went in the hospital.

857
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,638
They gave me a whole bunch
of, you know, painkillers.

858
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,504
They don't work because
you already have a tolerance

859
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,840
even though you've quit,
so it's up doing heroin.

860
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,175
Then, pretty soon,
your wife's coming in,

861
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,714
and you're doing heroin
on the bathroom floor,

862
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,579
and, you know, pretty soon,

863
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,879
they just get sick
of dealing with it.

864
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,786
And the last straw
was I quit again

865
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,518
and then broke my leg
racing motocross.

866
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,718
Same thing.

867
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,692
Then she just got sick
of dealing with it.

868
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:02,163
And, I mean,
you can look around <i>and...</i>

869
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,167
All-State in three sports
in high school,

870
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,736
played college football
and baseball,

871
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,806
and think of the life
I could have had.

872
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,137
And many times over,

873
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,506
I kept getting chance
after chance after chance,

874
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:20,345
and... and I'm still doing it.

875
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,749
Get a few days, and then,
I don't know.

876
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,718
It just goes on.

877
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,221
And then I have such
a tolerance,

878
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,258
I can do, you know, 40 times
more than the average person.

879
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,817
Literally enough to O. D.
a band of gypsies, you know?

880
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,525
And <i>so...</i>

881
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,664
That much right there
would O. D. a person

882
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,901
that's never done it before.

883
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,744
Oh, just bust up my nice room.

884
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,872
And then I'll cook up
some crack, some cocaine,

885
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,643
and put it on there, too,
and mix it.

886
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,276
Plus, I just ate eight Valium.

887
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,717
And <i>so...</i>

888
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,847
It's hard to imagine
why that's so addicting, <i>but...</i>

889
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,449
And it's not just the dope
that's addicting,

890
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,357
it's this whole thing.

891
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,430
Going up and getting it,
the rush of getting it.

892
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,623
Getting it from the Mexicans.

893
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:09,858
The cops are sitting
across the street.

894
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,265
The ride down, the ride back,
you know?

895
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,734
Making it up, fixing it up.

896
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,498
Literally, when I was coming
down and running into the house,

897
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,698
it's like Christmas.

898
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,172
You're running in here so giddy.

899
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,743
You got to get your water,
you know?

900
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,836
It's sad.
It's sad.

901
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,848
The more you're on,
the harder it is to come off.

902
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,353
And the problem is, is you feel
like you have the worst flu,

903
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,687
the worst everything,
and you're so sick.

904
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,885
You're throwing up.

905
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,758
Runs down your pants,
and you get some heroin.

906
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,423
I n two minutes,
you're at the top of the world.

907
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,659
And that's the problem,

908
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,292
because you're so low,
and, all of a sudden, bang.

909
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,338
You know, 'cause normally
when you're sick or whatever

910
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,463
or have cancer or whatever,
you're sick.

911
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,235
There's nothing you can do
about it.

912
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,866
But with this, you know
damn well you get some,

913
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,410
you go from here to here.

914
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,945
And so it's such a big jump

915
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,948
that, you know, that's one of
the reasons it's so addictive.

916
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,453
And I just hope and pray
that we can help some people

917
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,490
and... and for me to do this
in front of people like this

918
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,459
is unbelievable for me because
I would never, never do it,

919
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,621
which is, to me,
I'm making some progress

920
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,856
because I've got to help
some people.

921
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,796
And I think the only way
I'm gonna get better

922
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,390
is if I help people,

923
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,596
because then I'm not doing it
just for me, you know?

924
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,937
And I'm not showing as much
emotion because I'm high,

925
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,274
and that's what getting high
does, is it takes your emotion.

926
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,871
It makes the hurt go away,
you know, temporarily.

927
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:37,249
I'm willing to go through hell
to do something positive.

928
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,584
And <i>Daniel...</i> at me
all the time.

929
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,420
Like he's high and mighty
and I'm living in this room,

930
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,824
and he doesn't realize that...
and it's starting.

931
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,657
He's getting
his family problems now.

932
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,561
Got the wife wanting divorce.
It's starting.

933
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,692
You know,
I can see him in me so much.

934
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:59,005
Gonna put them on
a spectrograph, right?

935
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,407
Here's what morphine looks like,
right?

936
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,708
Here's what opium looks like.
Here's what Lortab looks like.

937
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,750
Here's what Percocet...
They're all the same thing.

938
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,719
They're almost the exact
same thing, you know?

939
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,655
So, pay for the doctor's visit,

940
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,488
pay for, you know,
for your insurance.

941
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,856
Pay for the prescription.

942
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,930
Pay to take it
down to Walgreens,

943
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,932
or get in your car,
spend $6 worth of gas.

944
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,970
Not get the exact same thing,
get a stronger version

945
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,665
for $ 10 in a little balloon.

946
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,387
When I first came here in '86,

947
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,548
drug deaths weren't that common.

948
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:52,493
We were probably seeing
<i>50 to 70 drug deaths a year.

949
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,088
The vast majority
were illegal drugs.

950
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:01,728
Last year, we did
411 drug-related deaths

951
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:02,930
in this office.

952
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,441
Of those 411,

953
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,537
242 were pure

954
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,411
prescription-drug-related
deaths.

955
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:19,456
These are drugs like oxycodone,
hydrocodone, methadone.

956
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,957
If you add folks
who are both illicit,

957
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,028
as well as prescription drugs,

958
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,962
that total goes up to 270.

959
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,762
If you think about it, pills,
painkillers in particular,

960
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,530
which is a huge problem here in
Utah from what I have noticed,

961
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,938
it's like smoking weed, which
is a grown plant, you know?

962
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,703
It's something that comes
from the earth.

963
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,904
For me, I think that's a little
lesser down there, you know?

964
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,447
It's like, "Okay, that grows."

965
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:49,417
It's not like it's okay, but
you're not gonna be hooked.

966
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,611
But people that are
on painkillers,

967
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,813
they're hooked, you know?

968
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,014
It gets you by <i>the...</i>

969
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,786
and it's just, from that point
on, you're screwed, you know?

970
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,555
You have to have it,
and you basically will lose...

971
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,857
I've seen people
just lose themselves.

972
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,693
You know someone, a good friend,

973
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,131
you know, and they're the person
you know,

974
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,136
and then down the path,
they've used so much

975
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,762
that they'll flip on you

976
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,602
and do whatever they can
to get their next fix.

977
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,539
They'll just lose their soul
almost.

978
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,447
It was not anything
you'd ever wish on anybody...

979
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,779
to lose a child.

980
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:26,688
Blake was a very outgoing kid

981
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,781
as, you know, in elementary,
junior high.

982
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,519
Very popular.
Had a lot of friends.

983
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,151
He was always kind of the leader
of the group.

984
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,923
He was doing well, you know,

985
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,532
until he hit about his sophomore
year in high school.

986
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,101
Got kicked off the team
as a sophomore,

987
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,831
grades started to drop,
and his personality changed.

988
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,930
He just became reclusive.

989
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,772
He'd come home,
and he'd go to sleep.

990
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,039
We never thought
anything about it.

991
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,810
Then we started questioning him,
and we started looking at him,

992
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,282
and once you look at him,
then you can see it.

993
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,682
You can see the signs.

994
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,721
You know, he'd come home,
and his eyes would be bloodshot.

995
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,689
He'd be tired.
He was pale.

996
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,522
There was many times
where I had to jump in

997
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,186
between my husband and Blake

998
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,662
because he was so frustrated
with him.

999
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:12,098
Blake would be high
or would have drugs on him.

1000
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,193
My youngest daughter,
who was in junior high,

1001
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,499
would come home
and go straight upstairs.

1002
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,971
My other son was serving
a mission,

1003
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,066
so he was kind of
out of the loop anyway.

1004
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,543
And we all knew that eventually
he was gonna overdose

1005
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,738
doing what he'd done.

1006
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:24,939
We knew that he couldn't do
what he was doing

1007
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,140
and live through it.

1008
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,015
And I was upstairs
getting ready to go to work,

1009
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,816
and my husband came running
upstairs and screaming at me,

1010
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,017
saying, "Suzanne, come down.
Something's wrong with Blake."

1011
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,821
And he was laying on the bed,

1012
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,123
and my first thought was that
he had cotton in his nose

1013
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,754
'cause he had foam coming
out of his nose and his mouth,

1014
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,199
and then I realized
that it was mucous

1015
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,271
and that he most likely
had a seizure.

1016
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,896
I pulled him off the bed
and couldn't get his mouth open

1017
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,599
'cause I think he was still
having a seizure,

1018
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,700
and I remember thinking
as I was prying his mouth open

1019
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,073
that he was gonna
bite my finger off,

1020
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,703
but you don't care, you know.

1021
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:02,615
And I got his mouth open
and started doing CPR on him.

1022
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,054
It was probably
the hardest thing

1023
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,283
I've ever had to do
in my life...

1024
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,722
to sit there and look at my son,

1025
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,294
who had a gazillion tubes
going into him.

1026
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,226
You know, at that point,
he wasn't a person.

1027
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,697
He was just somebody
that they were trying to save.

1028
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,601
And I remember thinking
that it's almost okay,

1029
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,036
that he'll be better off,

1030
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,132
that he's been through so much
hell in the last two years

1031
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:30,270
that maybe this is
a better thing for him.

1032
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,316
The physician told us
at that point that he would die,

1033
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,180
that we would be taking him
off the ventilator

1034
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:37,719
later on that afternoon,

1035
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,947
so to get our family together

1036
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,182
and to get everybody there
to say their last...

1037
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,918
you know, say their goodbyes
to Blake.

1038
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,654
And it was horrible.

1039
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,286
I mean, I remember standing
against the wall,

1040
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,728
sliding down it, sobbing,

1041
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,924
and my daughter was sobbing

1042
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,399
and my other daughter was
and my husband,

1043
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,630
and grandmas and grandpas
and friends.

1044
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,139
I mean, all the friends
from Bonneville High.

1045
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,870
They had to call security
to clear the halls

1046
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,072
because there were so many kids
that were standing there crying.

1047
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:12,814
I woke up in the hospital
about five days later,

1048
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,686
four or five days later,

1049
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,817
and I was in the hospital
altogether for about nine days.

1050
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,192
They told my parents
that I would...

1051
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,630
prepare to take me
off life support,

1052
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,726
and I just decided that's...
that's not my life.

1053
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,634
You only get one life,

1054
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:33,641
and that's not the life
I wanted to live.

1055
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,005
You know,
everything's good again.

1056
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,203
It's hard.

1057
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,941
Like Blake said, he takes it
a day at a time, and so do we.

1058
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,244
You know, every morning I get
up, I go in and look at him,

1059
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,410
make sure he's still breathing.

1060
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,817
And I probably will do that

1061
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:48,357
until he, you know,
moves out, anyway.

1062
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:52,792
But it's... You know, it
consumes your life even after.

1063
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,456
Even now that he's clean,
it still consumes my life.

1064
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,157
The drug problem has gone

1065
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,030
through the Terrace in Ogden
like a disease,

1066
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:03,799
wiping friends out,
my buddies out one by one.

1067
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,740
I mean, it's...
it's overwhelming.

1068
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:12,745
My perspective on it was,
I mean, it's only a pill.

1069
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,776
I mean, it's only one pill,
you know, once a day, if that.

1070
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,151
The teenagers would get
their drugs by...

1071
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,748
I mean, there was people
on the streets...

1072
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,123
old ladies that would get
prescribed it.

1073
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:29,426
There was people
that had back pains.

1074
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,727
I mean, the one day of the month

1075
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,927
where they got
their prescription filled,

1076
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:36,233
there'd be four or five people
at her front door.

1077
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,864
My whole sophomore year,
I don't think I experimented

1078
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,968
with anything more
than Lortab or Percocet,

1079
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,070
and my junior year

1080
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,911
is when I started to bump it up
a little bit.

1081
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,112
I would start, I mean, doing
OxyContin, morphine suckers,

1082
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,987
and my senior year
just got out of control.

1083
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:59,084
I mean, I was all over
the place looking for it,

1084
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,720
doing two or three, four,
five pills a day.

1085
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:05,096
I mean, spending hundreds
of dollars a day doing it.

1086
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,692
Well, when I was in high school,
I would look at heroin

1087
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,831
as in a whole different game
than OxyContin.

1088
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,704
I mean,
I've never even seen heroin

1089
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,143
for the fact
that just the name "heroin."

1090
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,274
But it's in the same ballpark.

1091
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,847
It kills people
just the same way heroin does.

1092
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,459
OxyContin is actually
a synthetic-based heroin.

1093
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,757
It's heroin into a pill.

1094
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,262
While working undercover,

1095
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:41,998
I found myself almost
in a sociological project,

1096
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:47,168
trying to figure out "What
is making this so enjoyable?

1097
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:52,078
Why are they just jumping
to get in to try this stuff?"

1098
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,777
And we got into conversation
of...

1099
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,012
One Sunday evening,
we were at a party.

1100
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:02,080
I was surrounded
by a bunch of teenagers.

1101
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,786
We got on the conversation
of religion.

1102
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:05,986
Come to find out,

1103
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,997
the overwhelming majority
of the kids around me were LDS.

1104
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,828
And so I asked them,
"Well, don't you feel guilty

1105
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,799
about going to church tomorrow?"

1106
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,893
And they said,
"Well, yeah, but you know what?

1107
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,938
It's really not
against the Word of Wisdom."

1108
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,905
And I said, "Oh, yeah?
Well, how so?"

1109
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,772
"Well, it's a pill.
It's not that big of a deal.

1110
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,345
It makes me feel good.
So what?

1111
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,539
It's not alcohol.
I'm not smoking anything.

1112
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,309
I'm not sticking anything
in my arm.

1113
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,250
I'm just taking a pill
and drinking some water.

1114
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,911
Big deal."

1115
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,249
There are a lot of parents

1116
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,917
that just have no idea what's
going on with their children,

1117
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,325
and it's not because they're
not paying attention maybe,

1118
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:44,458
but sometimes it's just that
you got to dig a little deeper.

1119
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,000
We had no clue.

1120
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,093
Really very good at hiding it.

1121
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:53,164
I mean, it's not like we're
not a pretty close family.

1122
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:58,373
A young lady, recently married,
had forged a prescription.

1123
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,381
She was involved
in a car accident,

1124
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:06,115
and she was legally prescribed
Lortab and hydrocodone.

1125
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:10,454
She found herself addicted
within a short period of time

1126
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,027
to the Lortab and hydrocodone.

1127
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,220
So, she was altering...

1128
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,492
She was going to different
doctors and doctor shopping,

1129
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,999
receiving a prescription,

1130
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,535
but then she was altering
the prescription

1131
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,434
to get her more pills.

1132
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,406
The pharmacist caught on
to this, turned her in.

1133
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,568
I conducted my investigation
and called the house.

1134
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,975
I spoke to her husband.

1135
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,171
Come to find out,

1136
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,217
she was a very key member
of the Relief Society,

1137
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,152
and he was afraid
at how this was gonna be viewed

1138
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,621
within his religious culture.

1139
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,021
But I could give you a list

1140
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,856
of so many people
that shop doctors,

1141
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,987
that are at the pharmacy
late at night

1142
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,622
or even at emergency rooms
coming up with something

1143
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,428
because they ran out of drugs.

1144
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,968
And you would look
at some of these people,

1145
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,629
go, "Are you kidding me?

1146
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,673
This guys takes them, but isn't
he so-and-so in the community?"

1147
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,003
It's ridiculous.

1148
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,201
That's why so many people
are hiding it.

1149
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,903
That's why everybody goes
through this denial

1150
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,104
and hiding it every day

1151
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,408
because they don't
want it to affect

1152
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,244
what happens in their church

1153
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,045
or their standing
in their church

1154
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,483
or their standing
in the community or whatever.

1155
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,884
We can't let it affect that,

1156
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:16,118
so we hide in this gray area
in the middle here of denial

1157
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,853
and, you know.

1158
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,428
"Well, you know,
but he's got a bad back,

1159
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,655
and that's why he takes it,"

1160
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:23,027
or "He's sick because..."
And you know what?

1161
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,930
And it's just because nobody
wants to take responsibility

1162
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,093
for where they're at.

1163
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,465
Nobody wants to really fess up

1164
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,334
and say that I got a problem,
that I am sick,

1165
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,533
and it's not just a bad back
or a bad shoulder,

1166
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,337
and that I need help.

1167
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,036
The reality of it is,

1168
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,909
is that people
do not want to acknowledge

1169
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,314
that which is uncomfortable
for them to see.

1170
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:57,557
During my childhood, we were
a very, very LDS family,

1171
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,430
and we'd always go to church.

1172
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,096
We'd always go to
my grandma's house on Sundays

1173
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,638
and have Sunday dinner,

1174
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,972
and we just had a happy family.

1175
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:11,103
I thought that Macall,
when she was in gymnastics,

1176
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,045
that she was gonna go
all the way.

1177
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,583
She was going to become
an Olympian.

1178
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:19,485
She was going to just
blow us all away.

1179
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,183
I was on floor
and I was doing a tumbling pass

1180
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,384
and I landed short

1181
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,189
and I hyperextended my knee
and tore my ACL

1182
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,025
and I had to have surgery.

1183
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,462
It took a year to heal

1184
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,534
and I tried to go
back to gymnastics,

1185
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,192
but it was too painful.

1186
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,531
It was <i>so...</i>

1187
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,071
Everything just wasn't right.

1188
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,697
I just couldn't get
back into it.

1189
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,742
I remember Macall wanted to go
to school, though.

1190
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,504
She would do gymnastics, too.

1191
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,307
She wanted to go to gymnastics,

1192
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,211
and I just
didn't want to take her.

1193
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,375
I started slacking
on being a mom,

1194
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,349
and, you know, she was like,

1195
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,421
"Please, Mom.
Take me to gymnastics.

1196
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,490
Please, please."
And I was like, "Ugh."

1197
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,425
I mean, it was one exit away.
You know, it was nothing.

1198
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,689
So I just ended up just staying
into school

1199
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:04,198
and getting a social life
and going with my friends.

1200
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,802
And then my parents got divorced

1201
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,669
and I was living with my mother
and my sister Lindsy,

1202
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:17,042
and my mom, she ended up
falling into using drugs.

1203
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,137
It's not a pretty sight
to shoot up.

1204
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,479
It's ugly, very ugly.
There's blood. <i>There's...</i>

1205
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,077
It's just ugly, and my kids got
to the point where they just...

1206
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:28,316
It was just like
Mommy blowing her nose.

1207
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,119
You know, it was no big deal.

1208
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,753
No big deal at all to see me
sit down and do that.

1209
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:37,094
"Hold on."
You know, I would...

1210
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,795
Before I could make breakfast,
I had to do my fix

1211
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,236
so that I could be normal
and fix breakfast.

1212
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,308
Even breakfast, you know?

1213
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,468
I'd get a call
from the principal

1214
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,569
when I was in junior high

1215
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,807
because I never was there.

1216
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:57,249
And he would leave message after
message, wondering where I was.

1217
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:02,120
And I was home tending
my two sisters

1218
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,750
without my mom.

1219
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,796
I wanted to go out
and play with my friends

1220
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,594
and not take care of my sisters.

1221
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,397
I thought that using with my mom

1222
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,463
would create
some sort of closer bond,

1223
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,633
<i>and...</i>

1224
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:27,407
it did, but it was just in
a really bad way.

1225
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,451
We wanted the mom
that we grew up with.

1226
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:34,580
The fun, outgoing mom that loved
to do activities with us

1227
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,821
and not just do her drugs
and go to bed.

1228
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,419
I was using heroin.

1229
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,329
I had to have it in me
every six hours.

1230
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,369
Otherwise, I would be sick.
I would be withdrawing.

1231
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:51,463
And I just remember waking up
in the mornings

1232
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,236
and feeling so sick
to my stomach

1233
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,243
'cause we didn't know how
we were gonna get the money.

1234
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,872
We broke in
to our dealer's house,

1235
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,679
and I remember getting
two baggies

1236
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,311
and then a piece
that was this big of heroin,

1237
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,754
<i>and...</i>

1238
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,292
and that lasted us a week.

1239
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,852
I look back on it,
I can't believe <i>that...</i>

1240
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,330
how fast we went through them,
you know?

1241
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,560
Being in <i>prison...</i>

1242
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,234
is so hard.

1243
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,909
I've been on an R&L
year lockdown

1244
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,274
23 hours a day.

1245
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:33,644
You only get out an hour a day
in the morning.

1246
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,217
But being off the drugs
feels so good.

1247
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,845
I feel so much better now

1248
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,483
than I did
back when I was using.

1249
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,653
I honestly feel happier now.

1250
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,731
Macall is in jail right now.

1251
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,356
What would you say to her if
you could talk to her right now,

1252
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:52,832
sitting next to her
in her jail cell?

1253
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:04,912
I don't know.

1254
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,642
I would say that...
I don't know.

1255
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,742
I can't tell her what to do
or how to think.

1256
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,619
I want us to have a regular
mother/daughter relationship.

1257
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,887
I want us to go get coffee
in the morning.

1258
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,655
I want to go to school.

1259
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,390
I want her to tell me
to do my homework.

1260
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,365
I want...

1261
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:29,336
I want to come home <i>and...</i>

1262
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,965
come home to her, you know,
cleaning the house

1263
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,872
or doing something normal.

1264
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,672
What?

1265
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,875
I got one for these guys.
Lindsy, you're gonna love this.

1266
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,722
I got to sit a little lower.

1267
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:52,494
I remember getting a cough once

1268
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:56,031
and she gave me some Tussionex,

1269
01:03:56,132 --> 01:04:00,466
and I thought it was just gonna,
like, you know, chill my cough

1270
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,265
so I can go play ball
or something for the night,

1271
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,305
go have fun, spend some time
with the kids,

1272
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,604
but I fell <i>asleep...</i>

1273
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,244
for two and a half days.

1274
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,473
Woke up.

1275
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:16,780
All three cars were gone,
wallet was gone.

1276
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,988
Part of my clothes were gone

1277
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,616
and the kids were gone
and I was hungry.

1278
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,921
And I had missed work
for two days,

1279
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,963
and I think, "Wow, every time
I get tired or something,

1280
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,863
she'll give me
a little 'aspirin, '

1281
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:35,495
and then I'd fall asleep
for two or three days.

1282
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:39,006
She's good.
Real good."

1283
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,804
Do you remember those, Lindsy?
She could run.

1284
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,003
"Here, here, no problem.

1285
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,807
Just, I know you got a cough.
Here, just take a little..."

1286
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,711
I'd go to sleep,
and I'd wake up two days later.

1287
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,580
And just everything's gone.
My wallet's gone, money's gone.

1288
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:51,915
They've been gone on vacation
for two days.

1289
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,549
"We just went to St. George.
We had a great time, " <i>so...</i>

1290
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,565
I don't know.

1291
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,573
I've been through
so many rehabs,

1292
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,768
and I feel like
it's just done nothing,

1293
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,813
and so I still am just
in my own little prison

1294
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:26,083
of going home
and isolating myself.

1295
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,322
<i>And...</i>

1296
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:35,523
Describe the Nancy personality
before drugs

1297
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:39,123
and then the Nancy
personality traits today.

1298
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,000
- Before drugs?
- Mm-hmm.

1299
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,403
I don't know.

1300
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:49,171
How do you feel about your life
and your kids today?

1301
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,372
I miss out on everything.

1302
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,641
What did you miss out on?

1303
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:54,875
What do you think
you missed out on?

1304
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,918
Be specific.

1305
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,782
I wasn't invited
to Lindsy's wedding,

1306
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,414
my eldest daughter's wedding.

1307
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:06,723
I didn't get to see
the birth of her first child.

1308
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,056
I didn't get to see
all the things

1309
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,100
that Macall went through
with gymnastics

1310
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,532
and all the things

1311
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,367
that she succeeded in
and won trophies in and things

1312
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,931
because I was too busy
out doing my own thing.

1313
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,943
I had no time for it.
There was no time.

1314
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:27,914
I had to worry about where my
next fix was gonna come from.

1315
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,919
And Maron.

1316
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:36,685
And Maron's been the one
that's been the...

1317
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:41,923
that's lacked the most
of no mom.

1318
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:47,492
She's just had nanny after nanny
after nanny.

1319
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,097
And it's not the answer.
It doesn't help anything.

1320
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,199
It just keeps getting worse
until you lose everything,

1321
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:58,007
including your kids,
the trust of your family,

1322
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:01,777
the trust of everybody
around you, you know?

1323
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:05,911
Worst of all, it's just the
trust of your kids, you know,

1324
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,458
where they have to hide
their piggy bank from you.

1325
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,825
I don't care if I live or die.

1326
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:22,165
I don't even care.
I don't.

1327
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:10,809
Hurry.
Back to you. Hurry.

1328
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,193
Just get there, Ron.

1329
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,668
Can you drive,
like, faster, please?

1330
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,966
Okay.

1331
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,667
Describe the feeling

1332
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,306
of withdrawing the first hour
today.

1333
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:51,683
Are you encouraged
after your first day?

1334
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,728
How does it feel?

1335
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,731
We're on Day 2.

1336
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,070
How do you feel, Nance?

1337
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,107
I feel really good.

1338
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,505
No, how do you feel, really?

1339
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,735
I don't feel good.

1340
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,574
Okay.

1341
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,774
You're doing awesome, though.
It's your second day.

1342
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,022
Enough of this.

1343
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,059
Several weeks later.

1344
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,602
I <i>feel...</i>

1345
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,071
I guess like
everybody else feels.

1346
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,108
Boring.

1347
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,776
All right, that's cool.

1348
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,051
Is that how you feel every day?

1349
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,888
I got to think that there's
a piece of all of us, you know,

1350
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,256
when stuff like this happens,

1351
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,921
and, believe me,
I can't speak firsthand.

1352
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,330
I can only speak as,
you know, observing,

1353
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,729
that there might be
the possibility of healing.

1354
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,737
One, is you're helping
other people,

1355
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:15,037
and, two, in the possibilities

1356
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:20,411
of having a conversation
with Macall,

1357
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,381
that you might be able
to rise above this,

1358
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,781
as hard as it may sound.

1359
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,979
Believe me, I'm being
very outside the box here,

1360
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,783
so if you could rise above it

1361
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,755
in a way that maybe
you could make a difference

1362
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,883
by showing the world
what true love is

1363
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,326
in spite of this disaster.

1364
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,126
Oh, you want me to forgive her.

1365
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,464
I'm proposing a conversation.

1366
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,833
- I'm afraid.
- Yeah.

1367
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,906
I'm...
No, not for what you think.

1368
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:49,740
I'm afraid because Macall lies
so beautifully,

1369
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,279
and I have all the lies
she's told me,

1370
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,350
and they're right here,
and once they're voiced,

1371
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:56,782
they never go away.

1372
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:57,977
Yeah.

1373
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,749
And if she tells me more lies

1374
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:05,884
and puts doubts in my mind about
what I know about my daughter,

1375
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,988
they never go away,
even though I know Amelia.

1376
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:14,433
I know who she was and what she
was and where she was going.

1377
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:17,061
To hear Macall tell me
more lies,

1378
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:20,073
I don't know
if I'm strong enough to hear it.

1379
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,472
I never would have imagined

1380
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,942
I would be sitting here today
with you

1381
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,376
under these circumstances,

1382
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,380
and I'm sorry.

1383
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,848
Thank you.

1384
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,784
I feel like I had a hand
in the upbringing of Macall,

1385
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:32,979
and she, at one point...

1386
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,181
I remember a very sweet girl
at one point in her life,

1387
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,419
and she always spoke very highly
of both of you.

1388
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,824
I just want you to know that.

1389
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,920
Like, you were her...
I n some ways...

1390
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,226
You must have loved her
in some way

1391
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,891
that she felt connected to you

1392
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,299
because she always spoke highly
of both of you,

1393
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,840
and I know there was times that
you took her into your life,

1394
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,135
and I know...
I thank you for that.

1395
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,302
- And I...
- I don't know.

1396
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,007
I can tell you what happened
at court after the...

1397
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,815
That whole day
during the plea hearing...

1398
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,081
This wasn't my feeling.

1399
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:12,923
I had the feeling that Amelia
wanted me to forgive Macall,

1400
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,429
to keep loving her because
she still needed somebody,

1401
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:20,525
and I fought that off
very strongly.

1402
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,001
I kept saying to Amelia,

1403
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,937
"But, Amelia,
she took you away from me,

1404
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,771
and you want me to forgive her?"

1405
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,539
I won't say
it's not a possibility.

1406
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:35,378
But I would like Macall
to take some steps on her own

1407
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,816
to follow through...

1408
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,353
to follow through
on the promises

1409
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,945
that she made to the judge

1410
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,183
to stay drug-free,
to stay clean.

1411
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,784
I know that Amelia
is feeling bad

1412
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,988
that Macall had to go to jail.

1413
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,089
I know that she feels bad,

1414
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,033
and I know that she doesn't want

1415
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,900
or will not like the idea
of Jasen going to jail

1416
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,199
or whatever's
gonna happen to him

1417
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,071
because that's just not the way
she was, and it's just...

1418
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,542
And I got to think Amelia
wouldn't want the two of you

1419
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,909
being held hostage
by this situation,

1420
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,778
spiritually, physically,
emotionally,

1421
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,943
and, you know,
and that's what I'm proposing

1422
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,112
is some sort of
a freeing experience,

1423
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,450
the possibility of that.

1424
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,285
And if the movie ended

1425
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,292
and it showed
even a conversation

1426
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,522
of initiating some possibility,

1427
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,360
imagine what that speaks
to the world is all.

1428
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,400
It's a beautiful possibility,

1429
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,335
but it's something for you
to ponder yourselves.

1430
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,998
- I wouldn't rule it out.
- Okay.

1431
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:36,043
I wouldn't say,
"That will never happen."

1432
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,376
Macall's never asked us
for forgiveness.

1433
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:42,917
She's never come to us
and asked us for forgiveness.

1434
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,454
She's never told us
what really happened.

1435
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:52,518
How do you forgive someone
if they don't seem to want it?

1436
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,996
Okay.

1437
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,527
I'm tired.

1438
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:12,107
I'm tired of lying about stuff.

1439
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:20,612
I'm tired of pretending
that everything's okay.

1440
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:28,256
I'm tired of being a fake.

1441
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:34,534
I'm tired of lying
about who I am.

1442
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:39,470
I'm tired of lying to my wife

1443
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,306
and just stop this whole charade
of everything's fine

1444
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,141
when it's not.

1445
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,511
And I just want to get better.

1446
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,115
This better work, man,

1447
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:59,058
'cause I'm gonna be pissed
if it doesn't.

1448
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,962
Who's that up to?

1449
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,157
Who's that up to?

1450
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,929
You guys.
So make it work.

1451
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,594
Well, dude, if you can't tell

1452
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,104
that I'm serious about this
by now,

1453
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,073
exposing myself like this,
then you're not seeing the real.

1454
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,441
I didn't... Just keep in mind,
I came to you guys.

1455
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:26,645
It was weird just how...
how fast I got sick.

1456
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:30,691
Yesterday morning
was the last I took anything,

1457
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,260
and I was sick last night.

1458
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,227
It was a rough night.

1459
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,322
So I'll be glad
to get over this.

1460
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,492
Over going back and forth

1461
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,503
and feeling good
and not feeling good, you know.

1462
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,038
So, are we ready to roll?

1463
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,267
I just want to get in there
and get started.

1464
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,638
I threw up.

1465
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,575
All right, <i>so...</i>

1466
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,204
All right.

1467
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,243
And I still love her.
I always will.

1468
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,115
I wish everything was better.

1469
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,616
Macall.

1470
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,842
What?

1471
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,434
What?

1472
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,591
I'm so sorry.

1473
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,354
Me too.

1474
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,228
Me too.

1475
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,494
Do you miss her?

1476
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,900
Every day.

1477
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:14,066
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

1478
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,772
She's forgiven you.

1479
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,677
Do you feel that?

1480
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,977
Oh, I pray she does.

1481
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:26,417
- I think she has.
- I love her so much.

1482
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:31,686
All I felt for you
the first time we were in court,

1483
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:35,285
I felt Amelia's love for you.

1484
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:39,595
I felt that she wanted me
to forgive you.

1485
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,464
I didn't want to.

1486
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:45,006
You took her away from me,
Macall.

1487
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:59,044
It's so hard
not to have her here.

1488
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:03,554
I know.

1489
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,956
I'm so sorry.

1490
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,961
<i>Just...</i>

1491
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:10,531
You know, the pain
that I have inside,

1492
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:11,860
I just can't imagine the pain

1493
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,959
that a mother would have
for her daughter.

1494
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:19,768
I want to go and be with her.

1495
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,775
I think about her all the time,

1496
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:29,545
but I feel her with me,
and it's okay.

1497
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:34,818
And I talk to her all the time.

1498
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,391
She loved you.

1499
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:41,553
She always, always loved you,

1500
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:46,965
and she always forgave you for
everything you ever did, honey.

1501
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,799
And she forgave you for this.

1502
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,034
She did. She does.
She still loves you.

1503
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:57,168
Nothing's changed.

1504
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:04,047
Okay? Do they let you go
to school here?

1505
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,484
Yes.
I started school today.

1506
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,749
- <i>So...</i>
- Okay.

1507
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:10,552
Is it hard?

1508
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,060
Even if it's hard, okay,
you've got to do well.

1509
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,062
- I will.
- You've got to do well.

1510
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,756
You've got to make up your mind

1511
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,834
you're not gonna be
like your mom.

1512
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,698
No.

1513
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,668
Nope.
I don't want to.

1514
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:28,641
And also, we have college and
stuff, so that will be good.

1515
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,211
Yep.

1516
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:37,413
So, you have time to get your
degree while you're in here.

1517
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:38,611
Yes, I do.

1518
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,982
Then you'll be all done,

1519
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,885
so when you get out,
you can get a good job.

1520
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,082
Yeah.

1521
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:46,524
And make new friends.

1522
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,858
It's just the dorms
are a little different here.

1523
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,592
Just a bit.

1524
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,866
You look a lot better
than you did.

1525
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,870
Thank you.
I feel a lot better.

1526
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1527
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:00,035
You looked bad.
You were too thin.

1528
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,540
Yeah, I know.

1529
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:05,511
Can we have permission
for them to hug?

1530
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:06,841
We can probably do that.

1531
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,881
Oh, honey.

1532
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:33,505
I just want to go back
to the way it was before.

1533
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,738
Hey, Dan.
It's Ron.

1534
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:15,111
I'm actually driving
to Salt Lake to pick up Kathy.

1535
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,480
I'm supposed to pick her up
at noon,

1536
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:19,610
and so we have 30 minutes,
her and I,

1537
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,586
to chat before we go
and see you guys.

1538
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:25,147
So we'll pick you guys up
at 12:30 at the offices.

1539
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,559
So bring the crew,
bring the camera.

1540
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:32,098
Today's a miracle, man.

1541
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,072
Danny, it's Ron.

1542
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,737
I just was calling you to give
you a little pep talk, man,

1543
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:20,075
just tell you
that I'm thinking about you

1544
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:22,046
and I know it's not easy.

1545
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,711
And you're an awesome person,
dude,

1546
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,687
and because somebody's addicted
doesn't mean anything.

1547
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,781
I mean, you're a great guy.
<i>So...</i>

1548
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:33,952
Let's stand in the future today,
you know?

1549
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,620
Let's not move
and stay committed

1550
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,789
and realize that there's some,

1551
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,025
you know,
some mountains to climb.

1552
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,998
But if anybody can climb them,
you can,

1553
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,036
and I will be there with you
to do it, my friend.

1554
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,596
So, I did this part with Nancy,

1555
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,107
and it just took
about two to three days,

1556
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:49,767
and things kind of stabilized.

1557
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,072
It was very cool.

1558
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:54,114
So, all the things
that you have at stake

1559
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:57,116
are worth
two or three lifetimes,

1560
01:25:57,218 --> 01:26:01,052
if not two or three days.

1561
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,815
Hey, Danny, listen.

1562
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,588
It's Ron again, and I'm sorry to
keep pestering you on the phone.

1563
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:08,787
I'm just concerned.

1564
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:12,628
You've had your phone off
for a few days.

1565
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,601
I was just joking about
the toilet cam for the movie.

1566
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,661
I'm kidding.
I know you're very sick.

1567
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,831
You know,
stand or sit at your bedside,

1568
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,272
or whatever I need to do
to support you.

1569
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:24,038
But whatever you're up against
right now, Danny,

1570
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,272
you finally get to step
through it, Danny.

1571
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,782
You got a beautiful wife
who loves you.

1572
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,876
You got five children
who are standing for you.

1573
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,319
And this is the time that you
step through the stuff

1574
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:38,051
that you haven't stepped through
in the last 15 years.

1575
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,788
And I am just sending thoughts
and prayers your way, my friend.

1576
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:44,694
I love you. See ya.

1577
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,048
So I think about that night
all the time.

1578
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:43,885
If, you know, I could have...

1579
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,186
If I was holding...
I was still...

1580
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,954
I was holding the phone
in my hand, you know.

1581
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,120
I should have dialed instead
of listening to someone else,

1582
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,322
but I didn't.

1583
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:53,457
And we lost... You know,
someone died because of it.

1584
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:56,833
If only we could promise
a rosy ending for all.

1585
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,704
Seems we tend to let our
experiences form our identity.

1586
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:05,245
People who actually believe that
they're sad, lonely, addicted,

1587
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:10,010
poor, victims, et cetera.

1588
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,177
You're none of those things.

1589
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:16,747
You are uniquely beautiful,
glorious, and Godlike.

1590
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:18,291
Even a miracle.

1591
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:22,386
We just all sometimes forget.

1592
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:47,046
So when you're done experiencing
all those experiences,

1593
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,454
come on back to that person.

1594
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:54,995
The beautiful soul you've always
been and will always be.

1595
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,825
It's a choice.

1596
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,023
A choice that can be made

1597
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,828
as quick as you up
from the seat you're in.

1598
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:03,007
Safe
journeys.

1599
