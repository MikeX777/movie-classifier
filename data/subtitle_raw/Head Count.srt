1
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

2
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,189
- I'm comin'.
- Slowpoke, jeez.

3
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,650
Oh!

4
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,689
- Thanks for the ride, bud.
- Of course, man.

5
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,589
Hey, uh, wish
you were coming with.

6
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,090
- Next year.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,459
Good luck with your bro. Ha!

8
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,099
- See ya.
- Bye, Evan!

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,129
- Have a great break!
- See ya!

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,399
- Thank you!
- Bye!

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,570
Bye, guys!

12
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,509
Fuck me.

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,349
I found out your dad
is definitely balding.

14
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,499
Hey, it's Peyton.

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,469
I don't answer
my phone very often,

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,539
because I am enjoying life,
so leave me a message,

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,139
and I'll probably call you back.

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,870
Maybe.

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,179
Hey, Peyton,
it's your little brother.

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,719
Um, I'm just calling to remind
you that I'm coming today,

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,490
because, you know,
dorms are closed.

22
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,259
I know you don't normally
check your voicemail,

23
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,329
but, um, just in case,
it'll be good to see you.

24
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,900
Uh, you don't have
to call me back or anything.

25
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,700
Anyway. Okay, um...

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,140
see you soon, I guess. Bye.

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,380
Peyton?

28
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,450
Peyton?

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
Peyton?

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,380
Peyton, if you're in there
watching porn again,

31
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,950
I swear I'm leaving.

32
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,999
You are of sound mind.

33
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:03,269
Jesus, dude! Haah!

34
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,839
You scared the shit
out of me, man!

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,739
- I'm here.
- Ohh!

36
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,779
Sorry, man. I... forgot
when you were coming.

37
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,349
Um, go ahead and set your stuff
down wherever you want.

38
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,820
- Way ahead of you.
- Great!

39
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,250
It's good to see you, man.

40
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,790
You too, Peyton.

41
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,399
So what do you want to do?

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,929
You want to hike into the park,

43
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,330
or go to a sound bath?

44
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,939
What the hell is a sound bath?

45
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,339
It sounds like bullshit,
but it's actually really cool.

46
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,639
Um...

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,970
they play these crystal bowls,

48
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,709
and the way
the sound waves resonate,

49
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,680
you feel totally fucked up
afterward...

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,289
In a good way.

51
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,750
Hiking sounds great.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,899
Really glad
you came out here, man.

53
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,030
I know it's not as fun
as partying it up in the dorms.

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,340
The dorms are closed
over break, so...

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,770
Ah, of course.

56
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,610
How your grades doing?

57
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,979
Here comes the Dad phase.

58
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,380
Coming up into the Mom phase,
"Are you seeing anyone?"

59
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,620
Well, are ya?

60
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,350
No.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,689
Life energy thrives

62
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,359
when you're with someone, man.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm playing the field.

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,629
Okay.

65
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,769
Well, generally,
you're supposed to score

66
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,930
- at some point while playing the field.
- Okay, Jesus!

67
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,869
Too far
with the Mom phases, here.

68
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,870
I'm your brother, and you need
someone to take an interest.

69
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,580
You still the slow one? Come on!

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,910
Bet you I'll beat you
to that rock!

71
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,550
Come on, bro!

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,919
Seriously?

73
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,360
Peyton, wait up!

74
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,030
God damn it.
Every time we go hiking.

75
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,820
Ohh!

76
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,989
See? It's an overhand knot,

77
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,790
and you tie it with one loop.

78
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,790
Gorgeous, huh?

79
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,070
Yeah, it's something.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Mmm. Come on.

81
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,869
Come here.

82
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,810
- Hold on, come on.
- What?

83
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,709
- Oh, God!
- Yep.

84
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,549
Ready? One, two, three.

85
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,719
All right.
Look like you like me.

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,520
One, two, three.

87
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,419
Kind of.

88
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,920
Trying to improve
my social media following.

89
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,129
Which one?

90
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,660
The one in the hat.

91
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,930
What should I caption this?

92
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,839
Uh, go talk to him.

93
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,600
No.

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,810
No.

95
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,809
Camille! Camille! Camille!

96
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,940
Hey, guys!

97
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,549
- Hi, I'm Camille.
- What are you doing?

98
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,949
Oh, my God.

99
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,980
Hey, I'm... I'm Evan.

100
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,889
- Peyton.
- Cool.

101
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,759
Oh, my God.

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,589
You want to smoke with us?

103
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,759
Uh, appreciate the offer,
but I don't smoke.

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,769
Okay. How about you?

105
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,699
Yeah... if you're offering.

106
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,739
We got other places
to see, dude.

107
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,909
Come on, Peyton.

108
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,540
We can hang out
up there for a sec.

109
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,110
Fantastic.

110
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,680
Thank you so much.

111
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,500
Hey, Zoe, don't be antisocial.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,499
This is Evan.

113
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,669
What up? Tori.

114
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,769
Haley. Nice to meet ya.

115
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,509
- I'm Vanessa.
- Hey, man, I'm Bryan.

116
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,939
- Tallyho! My name's Winston.
- His name is Nico.

117
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,079
- Damn it, Zoey.
- Yo.

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,849
That's Max. He's a dick.

119
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,210
- Sam, introduce yourself.
- Pay him no mind.

120
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,719
Hey, I'm Sam.

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,180
What's up?

122
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,990
Hi, I'm Zoe.

123
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,230
I'll be right...

124
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,279
Next Ansel Adams?

125
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,249
Jesus, no. I just need something

126
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,810
to put on the walls
of my shitty apartment.

127
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,150
Here you go, dude.

128
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,590
Thanks, man.

129
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,820
All right. Here we go.

130
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,659
Okay. Okay. Hold out your wrist.

131
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,799
If you wrap it around...
There you go.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,029
One friendship rabbit.

133
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,069
It all looks good.
They all look the same to me.

134
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,739
Wait. Is that
a race car lighter?

135
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah. I promise you
I'm not a redneck.

136
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,639
- Right.
- No, this is my brother's,

137
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,940
- Right, right.
- And, uh,

138
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,129
he was really into race cars.

139
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,309
- Your brother was?
- When we were kids, yeah.

140
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,310
Yeah. No, no, no.

141
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,849
- I promise. I promise.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,979
I stole it from him

143
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,589
when I was, like, 11 or 12.

144
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,119
He just... He let me keep it.

145
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,789
Sure.

146
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,790
After the bet on the race.

147
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,330
Uh... is he okay?

148
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,639
Yeah, he's fine. He just...

149
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
He doesn't like drugs.

150
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,940
Ooh.

151
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,909
That's funny.

152
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,679
He looks like the kind of guy
I buy shit from.

153
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Yeah. Yes, he does.

154
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't know. He's, uh...

155
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,960
He's just, like, high on life
or something like that.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,630
Must be nice.

157
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,830
Yeah.

158
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,369
- But of lenses.
- Do we have anymore weed? Ah.

159
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,069
Fish-eye kind of thing?

160
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah, it,
like, works pretty amazing.

161
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,409
Guys, it's late.

162
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,349
Let's get the hell out of here.

163
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,089
Um... yeah.

164
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,990
Bryan. Bryan, come on.

165
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,230
How do I jump down this rock?

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,130
Whoa!

167
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,360
Here, I'll help you.

168
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,270
- Ready, bud?
- One second.

169
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,139
So what are you guys doing now?

170
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,809
Uh, headed back to the place
where we're staying, I guess.

171
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,179
It's getting kind of late.

172
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,149
Zoe! Zoe.

173
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,679
Hey! Did Zoe tell you
we're renting a house?

174
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,349
She didn't. That sounds sick.

175
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,789
You should come back with us.

176
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,819
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on!

177
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,259
We have a spare couch.

178
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,829
It'll be fun.
Peyton, you can come, too.

179
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,299
We're going to barbecue

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,699
and maybe play
some drinking games.

181
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,399
Thanks,
but I don't drink, either.

182
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
Sick.

183
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,740
Yeah, I shouldn't.

184
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,409
My brother and I have plans.

185
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,879
Oh.

186
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,349
- Yeah.
- Okay.

187
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,180
Cool. Cool.

188
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,219
Well, it was nice to meet you.

189
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,790
Yeah. You, too.

190
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,729
Well, I tried.

191
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,329
If you're going
to invite a stranger...

192
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,930
I got to introduce you
to my biking buddies.

193
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,839
I think you'd really like them.

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,040
We'll take you out
on the trails one day.

195
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,879
- Shit, dude. You got to go.
- What?

196
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,280
For fuck's sake, run back there.

197
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,819
I'm not going to stand
in the way of you and a girl.

198
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,789
Yeah, but I... I mean,
this is the only time I get to see you.

199
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,920
We have the whole rest
of the weekend.

200
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,060
Go, dude.

201
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,290
Before you lose 'em.

202
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,269
Thanks, Peyton.
I'll, uh, see you later.

203
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,330
Hey, guys, wait up!

204
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,939
Biking buddies.
Fucking dumb-ass.

205
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,279
You and Peyton have
some unresolved issues, huh?

206
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,149
What gave it away?

207
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,849
I don't know.

208
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,310
Maybe the fact that you chose

209
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,049
this group of
fucked-up strangers over him?

210
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,520
I took a gamble.

211
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,959
Ah, thank God. We are almost there.
My legs are killing me.

212
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,529
Wow, looks awesome.

213
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,499
Yeah, it's got
an interesting vibe.

214
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,899
Kind of sixties.

215
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,429
Anyone feeling tequila shots?

216
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,269
Yes.

217
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,240
- Come on.
- Yeah!

218
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,939
All right.

219
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,279
Evan, stand over here.

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,579
So do you only have tequila?

221
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,179
Yeah. Do you like tequila?

222
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,410
- No, I love it, obviously.
- Right. Right.

223
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,330
Cheers.

224
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:54,429
Cheers!

225
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,499
Whoo!

226
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,270
- Oh!
- Owww!

227
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,449
And the flight attendant,
she just stared at me.

228
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,949
And she said,
"I think you must be confused.

229
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,189
There was no passenger in 23A."

230
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,889
Oh.

231
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,089
'Every time I came by
with the drink cart,

232
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,329
you were just sitting there,
talking to yourself.'

233
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,239
That's good.
That's good. So good. Okay.

234
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,269
Sam, that was terrifying.

235
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,479
All right. New kid, you're up.

236
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,109
Damn it. Do I have to?

237
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,079
- Yes!
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

238
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,549
Go to anonymousnightmares.com.

239
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,019
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

240
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,650
Here. Okay,
I don't know this website,

241
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,620
so I'll just choose
a random one.

242
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,590
Um, this one's called.

243
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,500
"Hisji, Hisji, Hisji, Hisji...

244
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,669
Hisji."

245
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,000
Uh... what?

246
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,600
That's the title, I think.

247
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,140
I don't know if I'm pronouncing
that right though.

248
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,210
Um, here goes.

249
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,919
"A Hisji is a vengeful thing."

250
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,249
Five times its name,
you never sing.

251
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,059
"With skin pale white
and eyes of green,

252
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,620
it's something
you've already seen."

253
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,259
This is fucking weird.

254
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,460
You sure you're reading it
right there, Evan?

255
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,170
That's what it says. Um...

256
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,110
"It's here. It's there.
It's there. It's here."

257
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,209
Provoke its form and disappear.

258
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,709
A Hisji is a vengeful thing.

259
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,379
"Five times its name,
you never sing."

260
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,249
Is that supposed
to be scary or...

261
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,050
Jesus. If Vanessa's not
scared, you know you fucked up.

262
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,620
Shit. Sorry, guys.

263
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,259
I guess I picked
the lamest one on there.

264
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,359
Yeah, well,
I think that's enough

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,029
scary stories for tonight.

266
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay. I know
what's going to warm us all up.

267
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,100
Cinnamon whiskey shouts.

268
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,279
- Cinnamon whiskey...
- Let's go!

269
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,540
Shouts!

270
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,279
The cinnamon was good.

271
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,149
I will shout
cinnamon whiskey to the sky!

272
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,120
Okay.

273
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,689
I'm going to get in the hot tub.

274
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,659
Sounds like a good move.

275
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,729
I'll... I'll get the tequila.
Be right back.

276
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,130
Oh, fuck.

277
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,630
Ah! Fuck.

278
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,470
This is so hot.

279
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,479
Shit.

280
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,710
- Here. Take the tequila.
- Thanks.

281
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,050
Fuck!

282
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,489
Ahh!

283
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,729
See? I told you.

284
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,400
More tequila.

285
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,570
Jesus, this is
a little hot right now.

286
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,810
Oh! Oh! Yeah!

287
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,650
Perfect spot out here.

288
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,190
Totally fucking alone.

289
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,329
No threat of a noise complaint.

290
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,530
Nothing.

291
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,599
So update me
on the group dynamic.

292
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,570
Well, a few of them are dating.

293
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,679
Fuck. I don't know
anybody's name, but try me.

294
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,679
Okay. Um...

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,749
Tori and Sam, Haley and Nico,

296
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,720
Max and Vanessa,
and Bryan and Camille.

297
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,159
Jesus. How many couples is that?

298
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,459
Uh, four.

299
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,130
So basically everyone
except for, you know, me.

300
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,739
You're, like, the single one.

301
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,170
Which makes me,
what, the ninth wheel?

302
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,170
Sweet.

303
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,909
That's rough.

304
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,580
That's three times rougher
than the third wheel.

305
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,790
It's okay. It's kind of nice
not being tied down.

306
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,860
True.

307
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,259
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

308
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,160
- That's my foot.
- It's okay.

309
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,770
You never see stars
like this in I.A.

310
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,449
Mmm.

311
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,490
What was that?

312
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,690
I don't know.

313
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,700
Hello?

314
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,340
Zoe, do you see that?

315
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,880
What?

316
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,420
Looks like a tree...

317
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,420
or cactus or something.

318
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,650
Yeah.

319
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,299
Well, I'm ready to get out.

320
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,699
- It's pretty hot.
- Yeah. I am, too.

321
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,430
Thanks.

322
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,710
It's cold.

323
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,940
Oh, shit. Pass me a towel.

324
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,009
- Here.
- I'm freezing.

325
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,710
I know.

326
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,579
Okay, let's go. Let's go in.

327
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,949
I got to tell ya.
Creepy out here at night.

328
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,490
Yeah. Pretty dark.

329
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,389
Okay, here, let's go.

330
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,029
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- Awesome. Okay.

331
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,660
Yeah, awesome.

332
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,769
Uh,

333
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,470
what the fuck were
you two doing out there?

334
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,579
Max, your turn.

335
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,779
Come on, Max.

336
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Hey. Hey, you guys good or what?

337
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,589
Where are you going?

338
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,659
Sam, turn the music down.

339
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,329
What happened? What happened?

340
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,500
- Nothing. We thought we saw somebody.
- It's fine. -

341
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,730
Did your lame-ass brother
decide he wanted

342
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,039
- to join the party after all?
- Max!

343
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,769
What the fuck
are you saying, man?

344
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,570
I'm just saying he sat there
and watched us all day,

345
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,079
and then you see
somebody creeping outside?

346
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,849
It was nothing, Max.
We were just seeing things.

347
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,619
Sam, turn the music back up.

348
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,619
Guys, just drink more.
You'll forget all about it.

349
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,789
- Oh, yes!
- Definitely drink more.

350
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,389
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

351
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,760
Come on! Two games out of three!

352
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,800
Lame!

353
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,469
Evan! Come take a shot with me.

354
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,740
Hold on.

355
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,050
Forget it. He knows nothing.

356
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,390
Yeah.

357
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,160
Mm.

358
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,730
I have better tequila
in my room.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,430
All right then.

360
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,790
Morning.

361
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,049
Okay.

362
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,989
Um, Sam, Tori.

363
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,190
Bryan, Camille.

364
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,689
Haley, Nico.

365
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,990
Max, Vanessa.

366
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,840
What the...

367
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,669
Evan?

368
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,669
- Fuck!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,409
Jesus! You scared
the shit out of me!

370
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,009
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,679
What the hell
are you doing out here?

372
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,110
- What's that thing?
- I don't even know. Just, uh...

373
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,650
Let's, uh...

374
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,980
Let's go back inside.

375
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,160
Okay. All right.

376
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,400
How are you feeling?

377
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,879
Like, uh, somebody's
excavating my skull.

378
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,009
How about you?

379
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,410
Not too bad,
all things considering.

380
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,850
So, back to Peyton today?

381
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,859
Nah.

382
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,220
I can't ditch you guys now.

383
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,759
I had too much fun last night.

384
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,060
Well, good. I did, too.

385
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,300
Are those cooked enough?

386
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,309
Are you sure
you had fun last night?

387
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,879
Yeah, of course,
I had so much fun.

388
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
I got, like,
no sleep last night.

389
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,150
Wow. You guys waste no time.

390
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,459
Not all of us start
the party at 9:00 a.m.

391
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,490
Yo!

392
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,199
Anyone want to do
shrooms with breakfast?

393
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,799
Oh, my God! Not again, Nico.

394
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,029
Fine.

395
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,730
Good morning, Camille.

396
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,300
Mmm! Morning.

397
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,439
Morning.

398
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,009
Good morning, love birds.

399
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,509
Ooh!

400
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,979
'Cause somebody
needed a quick one, right?

401
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,320
Camille!

402
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,220
All right, finish up, people.

403
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,289
Try and get to this place.

404
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,020
Where are we going?

405
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,990
This really cool spot
in the hills.

406
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,999
You can see, like,
the whole park from this one peak.

407
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,899
Sweet.

408
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,399
Anyone who's riding in my car

409
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,100
has to be outside
in ten minutes.

410
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,279
So, how was it?

411
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,379
- Come on, let's go.
- No, Zoe.

412
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,089
- Got to give me some deets.
- Camille, stop!

413
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,420
Ugh!

414
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,520
Guys, I don't care
what car you're taking...

415
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,329
- Seriously, Bryan?
- Get in a car.

416
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,529
Five eggs and a whole pack
of bacon wasn't enough?

417
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,129
- Where's Camille?
- We're going to be late.

418
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,470
Come on!

419
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,509
All right, we got everyone?

420
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,309
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Finally.

421
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,279
Wait. No.
You're missing somebody.

422
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,149
It's Bryan. He's in there
stuffing his face.

423
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,019
What?

424
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,549
No, babe, I'm here.

425
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,990
No, the, uh...

426
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,820
The... the... that other girl.

427
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,829
Um, blond hair.
She was... She was...

428
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,299
Camille's the token blonde.

429
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,899
New guy's a lightweight.

430
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,329
Has a few hits,
he starts hallucinating.

431
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,970
I mean, it's strong shit, dude.

432
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,100
I mean, your first time, you...

433
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,369
Whoo!

434
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,409
Ooh, that step.

435
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,180
All right. Thank you, friends.

436
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,150
Seatbelts. Everyone, seatbelts.

437
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,920
Haley, you too. Seatbelt.

438
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,919
That's a jumping cholla.

439
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,649
Why do they
call it jumping? Does it jump?

440
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,149
The spikes come closer

441
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,450
toward the heat at the bottom.

442
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,389
Careful of the pointy ones.

443
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,929
Like this one?

444
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,929
Yes. Oh my God!
Bryan, don't touch that!

445
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,929
- Why?
- Because it will stick you.

446
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,460
Stick me?

447
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,229
Yeah, I thought
I warned you about those.

448
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,039
One time I touched one,
and it did not end well.

449
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,200
You touched one?

450
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,109
Oy, that was a day.

451
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,379
But, like, that's
the boring side of things.

452
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,940
Can we go here?

453
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,379
I mean, the ratings
say that that's...

454
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,279
I know what you're saying,
but look at that one.

455
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,249
You're a natural. I'm going
to go in for a close-up.

456
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,089
- It's all in the eyes.
- If you hold it up to the light...

457
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,989
You hold it up,
you can see through it.

458
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,589
I know.

459
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,129
- I studied rocks in college.
- Come on.

460
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,129
Guys, let's go.

461
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,629
Bryan, let's go.

462
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,430
Shouldn't we go with them?

463
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,600
No.

464
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,609
It's so quiet out here.

465
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,450
Yeah, it is.

466
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,450
It's great for photos.

467
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,989
Do you think it was
a good idea to split up?

468
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,330
Uh, yeah,
they'll catch up to us.

469
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,269
My brother tried to get me
to hike this peak once before.

470
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,300
Yeah? Well,
it's famous for the views.

471
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,979
Jesus!

472
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,479
Gotta be from the rodeo
crowd we saw on the way in.

473
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,279
'Merica!

474
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,679
What the hell is there
to shoot out here anyway?

475
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,549
Unsuspecting teenagers.

476
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,189
It's not fucking funny, Haley.

477
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,519
It's pretty funny.

478
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,589
It's pretty funny.

479
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,760
No, it is.

480
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,390
What the fuck?

481
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm just waiting
for someone's head to explode.

482
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,599
It's a shotgun, babe,
not a sniper rifle.

483
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,239
Also, like, let's be honest.

484
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,169
They're not going to go for us.
They would go for Max.

485
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,710
Sniper's dream
with that head of his.

486
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,210
I think they'd go for Evan,

487
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,719
seeing as he's the new kid.

488
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,080
Oh, shit. Shots fired.

489
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,759
Literally?

490
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,059
Don't worry, Evan.
They wouldn't go after you.

491
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,690
They'd shoot Vanessa.

492
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,300
She'd for sure be
the first one to die.

493
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,799
We have summited Everest.

494
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,539
Oh, God! I'm out of breath!

495
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,270
Oh!

496
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,079
- Intense view.
- Yeah, that is...

497
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,450
Wow. Tremendous.

498
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,820
Not bad. Not bad.

499
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,219
This is beautiful.

500
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,460
Look, honey, you see it?

501
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,369
So you must come
out here all the time

502
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,609
thanks to your big brother, huh?

503
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,239
Not so much.

504
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,509
I actually try to avoid it
as much as I can.

505
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,079
Damn, dude.

506
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,479
If I had family out here,
I'd never leave.

507
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,179
Yeah, well,
the rocks and the trees

508
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,280
get kind of old after a while.

509
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,489
That, and sleeping
on the floor of a trailer.

510
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,220
Okay. See, what you got to do

511
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,359
is you got to take psychedelics.

512
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,459
You take, like, a new one
each time you come out here

513
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,160
so it's like
a new experience each time.

514
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,730
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fry my brain, though.

515
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,800
Yeah, ship's kind of sailed
for me on that one.

516
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,369
Shit. Sorry, man. I'm a dick.

517
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,370
Your brain's
probably totally fine,

518
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,139
lightly toasted at worst.

519
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,609
You don't know
how much 2C-E I've done.

520
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,179
Zoe!

521
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,449
What the hell?!

522
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,620
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,840
My leg.

524
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,889
You okay?

525
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,619
Christ! Is it broken?

526
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,320
Max! Where's Max?!

527
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,829
Zoe, what the hell happened?

528
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,790
- You just fell. You fell.
- No. No.

529
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,729
I didn't... Wait. Tori.

530
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,899
Okay, guys.
We need to get her up.

531
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,269
All right. Sam, camera.

532
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,269
Fuck! My camera!

533
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,909
Okay, guys.
What the fuck happened?

534
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,579
You were probably just
so wrapped up taking a photo,

535
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,479
- you forgot where the edge was.
- No! No.

536
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,849
No, I took it standing still.

537
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,680
One second I was up there,
and now I'm down here.

538
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,649
I... I didn't do anything.

539
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,689
- We have to get her up, okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,489
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm there.

541
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,959
Okay. Three, two, one. Let's go.

542
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,759
- Aah!
- Lift, lift, lift, lift!

543
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,529
Okay. Okay.

544
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,599
You're okay, you're okay.

545
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,500
All right. Let's go.

546
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,639
It's not broken.

547
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,909
I told you guys I'm fine.

548
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,509
It's really swollen.

549
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,510
You got to stay off of it.

550
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,619
I still think
we should go to the hospital.

551
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,719
No. I don't need the hospital.

552
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,419
If we're going anywhere,
we're going to the camera shop.

553
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,459
Fuck! Jesus Christ.

554
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,599
Okay, so you didn't fall,
and you didn't walk off.

555
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,999
So did somebody
fucking push you?

556
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,630
No. I don't know what happened.

557
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,970
I... can't remember.

558
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,579
Okay. Well, I say we go home.

559
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,449
There's really no sense
in staying out here.

560
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,010
Especially not with
the NRA fan boys over there.

561
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,819
Yeah, I agree.

562
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,360
My car's full.

563
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,020
Oh, man.

564
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,330
How do you not remember
falling at all?

565
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,660
That's the thing.

566
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,360
I remember it fine.

567
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,499
Okay, so if you remember it,

568
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,870
why do you say you don't
know what happened?

569
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,840
It's just... It doesn't
make any sense to me.

570
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,719
It was like I lost
complete control over myself.

571
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,590
It was like I was a...
A passenger in my own body.

572
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,090
Okay. Um...

573
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,829
have you been feeling off

574
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,700
or different lately,
like, before this?

575
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,670
What are you asking?

576
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,010
I don't know.

577
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,010
Just...

578
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,910
All set.

579
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,680
Want to go back in there?

580
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,880
Shit.

581
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,119
You're limping.

582
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,419
I'm not limping. Bryan?

583
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,689
Oh, my God, you two.

584
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,359
Come on, better take her!

585
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,590
Your foot! Your foot!

586
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,929
- You all right?
- Yeah.

587
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,960
Did it hurt? Did it hurt?

588
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,730
Jesus, come on, babe.

589
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,499
You're crazy.

590
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,700
- I'm going to go get a beer.
- All right.

591
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,669
- You okay?
- Yeah.

592
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,710
Camille wrapped it,
and then sat on it.

593
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,959
Bryan, are you sure
you know how to pack a bowl?

594
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,730
Are you sure?

595
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,799
Oh, wow, dude, you are...

596
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,399
You're unbelievable.

597
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,739
Kind of a little massage.

598
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,639
Ah! Okay, little less.
Little less.

599
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,810
- Little less?
- Yeah, thanks.

600
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,440
Try not to tighten up.

601
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,610
I try not to tighten up.

602
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,779
I know. I know.

603
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,749
There's definitely
something strange going on here,

604
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,150
something to do
with that guy we saw

605
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,050
by the Jacuzzi last night.

606
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,860
Thought you said it was nothing.

607
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,959
It wasn't.

608
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,999
There was definitely someone
standing there watching us.

609
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,500
Yeah, your perv brother.
We've been over this.

610
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,039
It wasn't my fucking brother,

611
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,770
and please don't call him that.

612
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,209
I'm having a hard time
believing you,

613
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,950
but, so you stop bitching,
I'll lock some doors for ya.

614
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,560
This is all for you, Evan.

615
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,730
Oh, the door is now locked,
so is the deadbolt.

616
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,530
Jesus.

617
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,139
Door number two.

618
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,639
Fuck!

619
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,740
- Who is that?!
- Shit!

620
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,649
Max, who is it?

621
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,150
Max? Open it.

622
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,559
Come on, open it.

623
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,830
Just open the door.

624
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,509
Speak of the devil.

625
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,609
Hey, there.

626
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,009
Oh, God.

627
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,609
Peyton, what the hell
are you doing?

628
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,949
Hey, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

629
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,849
Evan, what the hell, man?

630
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,119
I... I thought something terrible
happened to you.

631
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,119
I... I just... I'm fine.

632
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,020
I'm not ready to go home.

633
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,999
Well, you just... You spent
a whole 'nother day here, man.

634
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,699
I know. I just...
I can't leave right now.

635
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,069
We're figuring shit out,

636
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,840
and I got to
make sure Zoey's okay.

637
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,739
What happened? A fall?

638
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,209
- No.
- We're fine, Peyton.

639
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,880
We just... We got it.

640
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Hey, um...

641
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,120
Were you here last night?

642
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,590
You know, watching us?

643
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,150
What?

644
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,189
No, of course not.

645
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,820
Of course not. Okay.

646
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,760
So, um, how the fuck
did you find this house?

647
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,240
- Oh!
- Whoa, relax.

648
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,910
I have the TeenSafe app.

649
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,720
It's hooked up to GPS,
so I always know where Evan is.

650
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,759
Wait.

651
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,199
Oh! So you track your brother
like the goddamn NSA.

652
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,229
Yeah, well, I've had to be
more than a brother to Evan

653
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,869
'cause our parents are dead,
so... yeah,

654
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,339
I was just checking up
on my brother

655
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,800
to make sure he's okay,

656
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,209
if that's all right
with all of you.

657
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,979
Of course. Of course.

658
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,879
You should bring him home.

659
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,810
Who knows what kind
of shenanigans he'll get into

660
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,649
- with us, right, guys?
- Max, shut up!

661
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,920
Evan, you can do
whatever you want to do. Okay?

662
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,940
I'm staying.
Peyton, you should go.

663
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,040
Okay, uh...

664
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,020
Call me if you need anything.

665
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,339
Come on, guys.
We're on vacation.

666
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,770
Who's down for shots?

667
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,879
- Oh, amen!
- Amen! Whoo!

668
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,079
Me!

669
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,749
Gonna be a rematch.

670
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,749
Don't have to ask me
twice for shots!

671
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,119
Has anyone seen my hat?

672
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,749
Let's play some drinking games.

673
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,019
Beer pong. Pong this up!

674
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,989
You like some? Come on.

675
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,059
All right.

676
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,789
Any hat will do.

677
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,429
Get some red cups.

678
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,059
So what are we drinking tonight?

679
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,860
Tequila. Obviously.

680
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,799
Okay, okay, okay.

681
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,909
Vanessa, you are up.

682
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,409
Okay, I never
remember the rules, so...

683
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,209
God damn it, Vanessa!

684
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,349
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

685
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,180
Um, five, five is...

686
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,389
- No!
- Thanks for playing.

687
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,089
Five is jive.

688
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,120
- No!
- Yes. Five is jive.

689
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,389
You get up and dance.

690
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,290
Dance, dance, dance!

691
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,029
Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!

692
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,029
Okay. Okay, that...
That could be a dance.

693
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,999
All right, okay.
Zoe, I'm very impatient today.

694
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,739
You're up.

695
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,770
- I picked a jack.
- Yes! Yes!

696
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,179
Never have I ever.
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

697
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,050
All right, never have I ever...

698
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,449
Oh, I have one.

699
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,149
Jerked off in a public restroom.

700
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,319
Eww! Eww!

701
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,989
Sam, you fuckin' liar.
Put your finger down.

702
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,929
- That's okay, baby.
- Every guy has done it.

703
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,990
Next! Next! Next! Next!

704
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,160
Okay, all right, uh...

705
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,270
never have I ever...

706
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,069
uh, worn makeup.

707
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,910
- Oh, come on. Really?
- That one's stupid.

708
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,379
You are just killing me
over here.

709
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,940
Okay, uh, let's see.

710
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,809
- This sucks.
- Snooze fest.

711
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,520
Never have I ever...

712
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,089
- gone down on a girl.
- Ohh!

713
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,989
Everybody, down, down,
down, down, down.

714
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,959
Oh, sure, that's the one
that you own up to. Okay.

715
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,320
- Miss Tori.
- Okay, um...

716
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,359
- Miss Tori.
- Miss Tori.

717
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,099
Uh, never have I ever, um...

718
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,899
Oh! Never have
I ever had my dick sucked.

719
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,169
Ooh!

720
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,939
You don't even have a dick!

721
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,539
It just wouldn't count!

722
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,309
- How would you know, Nico?
- She has a huge dick.

723
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,370
- Yeah.
- Rando dicks.

724
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,409
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

725
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,209
Love you, Bryan.

726
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,919
All right. Sam,
master of bullshit, you're up.

727
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,049
What?

728
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,189
Whoa! Hey!

729
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,189
- Aw shit.
- Oh, my God!

730
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,920
- Bryan?
- What the hell was that?

731
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,559
Uh, power outage, I think.

732
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,190
Yeah, scared the shit outta me.

733
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,999
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait.

734
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,829
Okay, well, where's the vodka?

735
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,230
- Sam, what the fuck?
- What?

736
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,939
You were just
right fucking here.

737
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,300
You were literally
just next to me.

738
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,600
How the hell did you do that?

739
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,370
What are you
talking about, babe?

740
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,939
- Ugh!
- What...?

741
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,540
Uh, has someone
got a flashlight?

742
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,579
- There's one right here.
- Shit.

743
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,080
Thanks, man.

744
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,950
I don't see anything.

745
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,350
Guys, this... this is stupid.

746
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,489
Let's just go
to the front of the house.

747
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,089
- I've been here the whole time.
- Fucking haven't, Sam.

748
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,529
You were in another room
playing a game.

749
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,999
- He was my partner.
- No.

750
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,399
Well, the breakers are all good,
so I don't know what's going on.

751
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,599
- You okay, babe?
- No, I'm not okay.

752
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,499
Uh, Sam, little confused here.

753
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,239
How did you get
over here so fucking fast?

754
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,909
What the fuck
are you talking about?

755
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,539
I've been here
for, like, an hour.

756
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,079
You fucking liar! You were
sitting right next to me!

757
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,279
Did Nico spike
your shit with shrooms?

758
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,049
We've been in here
playing two on two

759
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,319
for the last 20 minutes.

760
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,150
Me and Sam
against Haley and Bryan.

761
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,259
I-I don't know. Did you, Nico?

762
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,090
What the fuck! No!

763
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,529
I didn't... Why would I do that?

764
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,299
- That's not me!
- Totally would, Nico.

765
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,599
No, I fucking wouldn't!

766
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,499
Guys, come on.
This is ridiculous!

767
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,399
Okay, wait.
Everybody just shut the fuck up.

768
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,940
Oh, here we go.

769
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,240
There was somebody
sitting there.

770
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,410
What if it wasn't Sam?

771
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,510
But it was.

772
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,179
How do you know?

773
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,119
We're all
pretty fucked up right now,

774
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,650
but we're with it enough to know
somebody was sitting there.

775
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,620
Nope, nope.

776
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:53,320
Oh, babe, come on!

777
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,290
No. No, no, no, no.

778
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,969
I don't see anything.

779
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,239
What the fuck?

780
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,639
No, seriously. What the fuck?

781
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,339
Someone needs
to explain this shit.

782
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,139
I'm getting pissed off
at all of you.

783
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,439
- Haley, baby.
- No, Nico.

784
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,639
- Should we call the police?
- Yes.

785
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,449
- No! Nooo!
- Yes!

786
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,610
No! No. Relax, okay?

787
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,619
We've all been drinking.

788
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,049
We're probably just confused.

789
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,489
- No!
- What?!

790
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,550
What if that person
is still in the house?

791
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,389
Oh, my God. Can you not?

792
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,220
For fuck's sake!

793
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,359
Max, no!

794
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,629
Sam, you go. Grab that knife.

795
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,160
Sam, what the fuck
are you doing?

796
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,460
I don't know! Vanessa told me!

797
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,129
- Ugh!
- I'm going with them.

798
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,030
I'll stay here with Camille.

799
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,249
That's weird.

800
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,719
Yeah, we should check the, um...

801
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,260
What was that?

802
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,359
Kick a cup?

803
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,330
Try not to kick cups, please.

804
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,270
Okay, this one works.

805
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,170
Okay.

806
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,309
Uh...

807
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,710
- Huh!
- Jesus.

808
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,380
Okay.

809
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,320
Sam, go on.

810
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,639
Is the power out in here, too?

811
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,420
Fucking breaker?

812
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,760
Oh!

813
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,600
What the fuck?

814
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,720
Okay.

815
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,320
Bathroom clear.

816
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,390
Okay.

817
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,840
That's weird.

818
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,210
That's fucking weird.

819
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,870
Uh...

820
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,810
Nobody.

821
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,750
I swear there was someone else.

822
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,589
Oh, my God!

823
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,490
Fucking Max.

824
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,699
So?

825
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,500
There was nobody else
in the house.

826
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,439
Jesus, we must be high
off our asses.

827
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,209
What the hell are we supposed to
do in there with the lights out?

828
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,879
We'll stay here. It's fine.

829
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,580
Not Kings Cup.
Something else, please.

830
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,819
Look. Fuck games.

831
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,560
Let's just stick to what we know
and just drink.

832
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,860
Ooh. Ooh.

833
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,659
And smoke.

834
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,669
Have ourselves a little doobie.

835
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,439
I swear I didn't put
anything in anyone's drink.

836
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,939
Stop bringing it up.

837
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,739
Yeah, sure.
Okay, dude, whatever.

838
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,839
What's up, dude?

839
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,610
Morning. Made you a bracelet.

840
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,549
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, dude.

841
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,149
Oh, shit.
Lights are back on. Nice.

842
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,720
Oh, God.

843
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,559
You guys were
pretty fucked up last night.

844
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,390
Is Zoe's ankle doing any better?

845
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,959
Didn't check.

846
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,499
She seemed to sleep
all right though.

847
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,770
That's good.

848
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,470
What?

849
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,000
Just making sure Max
isn't listening.

850
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,709
They were together before?

851
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,810
- Yeah.
- She dumped him.

852
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,750
Then she picks up
some rando on a weekend trip.

853
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,789
- Yep.
- Yeah.

854
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,889
Guess I'd be pissed, too.

855
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,629
I mean, Max does not have
your insane ability

856
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,499
to tell scary stories though.
So you got that going for you.

857
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,999
That's right.

858
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,669
That was an instant
panty-dropper, wasn't it?

859
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,469
Wh-what was it called,
um, the Five Monster?

860
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,700
No, no, no. Uh...

861
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,439
- Hissky. It was called Hissky.
- That's right, Hissky.

862
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,909
Yo, you got a lighter?

863
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,050
Hissky.
Hissky, that's right, yeah.

864
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,779
Hissky, whiskey.

865
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,920
Do we have any whiskey left?

866
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,970
"Hisji." It was called "Hisji."

867
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,110
Uh-huh.

868
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,240
I'll be right back, guys.

869
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,109
You want your lighter back?

870
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,979
- Yeah, thanks for that.
- Yep.

871
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,980
Thank you very much.

872
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,740
What the fuck are you doing?

873
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,130
Fuck, no.

874
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,470
Evan?

875
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,370
Zoey.

876
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,139
Hey, um, look, so I...

877
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,309
I think that I should be
getting back to Peyton today.

878
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,880
I just think...

879
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,980
You okay?

880
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,489
Did you get out here
by yourself?

881
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,459
Yeah. It's... It's better today.

882
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,199
Right, okay. Um...

883
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,470
So, I just... I really think that.

884
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,900
I should spend at least
some time with my brother.

885
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,850
Don't leave me.

886
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,379
- Zoey...
- Just...

887
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,750
don't leave me, please.

888
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,420
Okay. I won't.

889
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,430
The boys are leaving soon.

890
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,770
They're going to the mines.

891
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,399
You go in Nico's car.

892
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,839
I'll ride with Max.

893
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,209
He's already mad.

894
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:05,910
Yeah, I know.

895
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,949
Um, mind if I go
get ready real quick?

896
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,820
Go. I'll probably already
be out there when you get back.

897
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,390
Okay.

898
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,469
Hey, can you pack this? Thanks.

899
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,919
Evan?

900
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,450
We're leaving.

901
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,230
Come on.

902
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,969
One second.

903
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,310
Whoo!

904
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,079
You picked a hell of a weekend

905
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,419
to tag along
with the crew, Evan.

906
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,249
- Nico?
- Yeah.

907
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,450
- Tell the truth.
- Okay.

908
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,389
Did you spike our shit
last night?

909
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,629
You dick! No!

910
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,899
I didn't! Honest, swear to...
Hand on God, like, Bible!

911
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,469
I didn't!

912
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:36,600
Jeez!

913
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,039
Well, then I have to say
I'm disappointed

914
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,909
that we hallucinated Sam and not.

915
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,909
- Anderson Cooper.
- Anderson Cooper.

916
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,209
I do not understand
your fascination with that man.

917
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,979
God, 'cause he's a god.

918
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,649
I don't think
we hallucinated him.

919
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,119
And I think
he might be an alien.

920
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,920
- Wait. What did you say?
- What?

921
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,389
Nico, stop the car!

922
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:58,560
Fuck!

923
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:02,259
We're okay. We're okay.

924
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,990
Everyone's okay.

925
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,260
We're fine.

926
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,199
We're fine.

927
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,369
I guess.

928
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:10,499
Hello.

929
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,240
Ugh.

930
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,140
All right. I heard
the coolest one's up there.

931
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,280
It's fine! No one died!

932
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,250
Where the fuck is Zoey?

933
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,159
What?

934
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,520
Where's Zoey? She said
that she was going with Max.

935
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,990
What the fuck
is he talking about?

936
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,229
Yeah, Zoey couldn't come.

937
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,130
She couldn't even
get out of bed.

938
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,369
No. No, no, no, no.

939
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,239
She... I talked to her.

940
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,969
She was sitting on the...
On the porch.

941
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:50,670
She specifically told me
she was going in Max's car.

942
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,209
Okay.

943
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,979
This fool's crazy. Confirmed.

944
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,449
I'm just gonna pretend
like he doesn't exist,

945
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,080
so I can actually enjoy
the last day of my vacation.

946
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,489
- Max, hold on.
- What?

947
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,419
Evan, I saw Zoey
right before we left.

948
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,989
She was in her room
with everyone.

949
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,589
She was in bed.

950
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,359
No, she said that her ankle
was doing a lot better.

951
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,599
No, dude. It was a lot worse.

952
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,399
That's why Haley
and them stayed behind

953
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,070
so they could keep
an eye on her.

954
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,220
How many of them are there
back at the house?

955
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,590
Five?

956
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,090
We've got to go
back there right now!

957
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,699
- Evan, wait!
- Hey, that's my car!

958
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,429
Wait, Evan,
where are you going?!

959
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,739
- What...
- Wait! Let me in.

960
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,639
What is happening?

961
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,009
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Close the door!

962
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,710
- Evan!
- That... That story I was reading,

963
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,679
- "The Hisji"?
- What?!

964
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,789
- I think it fucked us, okay?
- You need to start explaining.

965
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,689
I know this sounds
fucking insane,

966
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,489
but I think I started something,
summoned something.

967
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:15,429
Okay, can you just
pull over right now?

968
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,629
You're going really fast.
I don't want anything to happen.

969
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,229
- You can do whatever you want...
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

970
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,369
I'm not insane. Think about it.

971
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,339
You were there when Sam
was in two places at once,

972
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,569
and that is not the first time
that's happened this weekend.

973
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,369
It happened
with Sam during Kings Cup.

974
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,270
It happened with Tori
when Zoey fell.

975
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,240
There's been an extra person
the whole time?

976
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,410
Yeah, right in front of us,
and we had no idea.

977
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,820
I finished that story,
and it fits. It fucking fits!

978
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,520
I don't know why, but this thing
has it in for groups of five.

979
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,060
If we don't get back there, something
bad's gonna happen, something terrible.

980
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,359
What the fuck just happened?

981
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,759
This car's a piece of shit.

982
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,259
Evan!

983
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,860
- Let's go!
- Hold up! Wait for me!

984
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,799
Zoe?

985
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,699
What the fuck?

986
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:37,509
Oh, my God.

987
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,780
- What is that?
- Camille?

988
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,380
What's that sound?

989
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,780
Fuck!

990
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,819
Fuck!

991
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:25,720
Oh, my God.

992
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,470
Shit.

993
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:50,680
Zoe!

994
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,550
Zoe!

995
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,359
Zoe, what happened?

996
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,720
Are you hurt?

997
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,729
Zoe!

998
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,629
No.

999
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,440
Zoe?

1000
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:18,610
What happened?

1001
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,910
Zoe?

1002
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,480
Zoe, where are they?

1003
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,450
They made their own choices.

1004
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,620
- What?
- They'll live together forever.

1005
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,230
Fuck!

1006
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,329
Camille.

1007
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,369
Camille?!

1008
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,439
What do you mean?

1009
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,600
Zoe?

1010
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,340
Nobody in there!

1011
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,310
Camille?

1012
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,780
Slow down, Max!

1013
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,849
They're coming.

1014
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,850
Camille?

1015
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,920
- Who's coming?
- Get away from her!

1016
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,959
Camille!

1017
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,560
That isn't Zoe!

1018
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:18,670
You didn't have
to fucking speed.

1019
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,640
One...

1020
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,539
Two...

1021
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,639
Camille!

1022
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,280
New kid.

1023
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,649
Three...

1024
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,049
Wait! Wait up!

1025
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,680
Four...

1026
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,419
Five.

1027
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,859
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1028
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,630
Zoe?

1029
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,860
Zoe, what... Your ankle.
What are you doing?

1030
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,420
Oh! Oh, my God!

1031
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,490
Oh, my God! Wait!

1032
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:15,629
Nico, Nico, Nico! Help me!

1033
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:18,490
- Nico, help me! Please!
- I got her! I got her!

1034
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,560
Come on!

1035
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,630
- Open the door!
- It's fucking jammed!

1036
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,769
Open the door!

1037
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,870
- It's jammed!
- Open the door!

1038
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,810
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1039
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,060
- Help me!
- What is that?!

1040
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,560
No!

1041
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,399
Wait, get the couch!

1042
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,679
Make a tourniquet or something!

1043
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,909
She's dead!

1044
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,649
Fuck! Why would she do that?!

1045
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:12,449
- It made her do it!
- Oh, fuck!

1046
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,980
What the fuck is that thing?!

1047
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,889
Shit!

1048
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,460
This doesn't make
any sense! Fuck!

1049
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,800
Help!

1050
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,169
- Don't go, man!
- Dude, get the fuck outta my way!

1051
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,909
My girlfriend's out there!

1052
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,739
No, she's not!
That's that fucking...

1053
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,709
That's definitely fucking her!

1054
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:42,949
- No, it's not!
- It is!

1055
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,519
- It has to be her!
- Dude, no!

1056
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,850
Nico!

1057
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:52,189
Where the fuck
is she? Where the fuck...

1058
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,120
It's okay. That wasn't Haley.

1059
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,729
Haley's fine.
I'm sure Haley's fine.

1060
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,959
I can't fuckin' do this.

1061
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,629
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1062
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,569
It's okay.
I'm sure we'll be okay.

1063
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,480
Um, Evan?

1064
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,180
Nico! Nico! Let me in!

1065
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,149
They're going to kill me!

1066
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,089
Nico! Help me!

1067
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,589
What the fuck is that thing?!

1068
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,989
The couch! Push it up!

1069
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,790
Push! Push! Push!

1070
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,660
Shit!

1071
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,140
Aah! Shit! Aah!

1072
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,740
What the fuck?!

1073
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,109
Where'd it go?

1074
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,849
Oh, my God!

1075
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,149
You fucking liar!

1076
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,680
You were sitting
right next to me!

1077
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,819
My camera!

1078
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:01,920
What is it saying?

1079
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:06,229
Max! Where's Max?!

1080
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,060
So you didn't fall,

1081
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,529
and you didn't walk off,

1082
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,199
so did somebody
fucking push you?

1083
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,900
They'd shoot Vanessa.

1084
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,269
She'd for sure be
the first one to die.

1085
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,840
What does it want?!

1086
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,909
It wants us!

1087
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,890
Is it... Is it gone?

1088
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,999
Evan!

1089
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,839
- We're leaving!
- Evan.

1090
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,239
It'll be fun. Come.

1091
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,779
Evan.

1092
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,779
What the hell, man, I...

1093
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,649
I thought something terrible
happened to you.

1094
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,010
Guys?

1095
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,889
Vanessa.

1096
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,590
Guys, what are you doing?

1097
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,829
Guys?

1098
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,199
Camille!

1099
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:51,269
Nico! Nico.

1100
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,940
Oh, my God, Nico!

1101
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,039
Max, get that off your face!

1102
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,839
Nico, what are you doing?
Please! Nico!

1103
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,109
Nico, don't drink that!

1104
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,110
Oh, my God!

1105
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:05,749
Oh, my God! Nico!

1106
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,280
Why would you do that?!

1107
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,189
Nico! Oh, my God! Max!

1108
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,950
Max, get that off your head!

1109
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,719
Max! Stop it!

1110
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,089
Stop it, Max! Stop it, Nico!

1111
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,830
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1112
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:23,129
Guys! Oh, my God, Vanessa!

1113
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,910
Holy shit!

1114
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,390
No! What?

1115
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,169
No, I... I can't!

1116
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:05,270
Where...

1117
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,179
Oh, shit! Help...

1118
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,749
Oh, my God!

1119
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,010
How do I get...

1120
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,719
How do I get out of here?!

1121
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,760
Shit! Shit!

1122
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:37,840
Oh, God.

1123
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:41,710
Wait. Wait.

1124
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,119
Please. Please.

1125
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,389
Please.

1126
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,059
Please.

1127
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,489
- Hey, it's Peyton...
- Hey, Peyton. Peyton.

1128
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,059
I don't answer
my phone very often,

1129
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,859
because I am enjoying life,

1130
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,199
so leave me a message,
and I'll probably call you back.

1131
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,300
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1132
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,040
Hey, it's Peyton.

1133
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,079
I don't answer my phone
very often,

1134
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,879
because I am enjoying life,

1135
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,980
so leave me a message,
and I'll probably call you back.

1136
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,749
Hey, Peyton.

1137
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:28,059
Um, listen, if you get this,
can you... can you please

1138
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,359
come back to the house
where you found me last night?

1139
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,260
Um, I'm kind of...

1140
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,829
Oh, my God.

1141
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:39,269
I... I really need your help.

1142
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,539
I'm in a lot of trouble here.

1143
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,279
Look, I'm so sorry.

1144
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,880
And I just...

1145
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:56,790
Love you, and if...

1146
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:00,459
If I don't see you...

1147
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,860
Goodbye.

1148
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:24,310
No, no, no. No. No.

1149
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,880
Evan.

1150
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,550
Oh, God.

1151
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,250
Fuck.

1152
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,830
We'll all be together now.

1153
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,680
Evan!

1154
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,090
Hello?

1155
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,519
Hello?

1156
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,200
Evan?

1157
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:00,530
Shit.

1158
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,800
Peyton?

1159
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:11,270
Jesus, dude!

1160
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,439
You scared the shit out of me!

1161
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,740
- Sorry, man.
- Ahh!

1162
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,650
Where is everybody?

1163
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,120
Just left.

1164
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:23,549
Everything okay?

1165
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:26,159
Sorry, dude, I didn't get
your voicemails till just now.

1166
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,660
No problem. I'm just, uh...

1167
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,460
ready to get out of here.

1168
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,100
Okay. Great. Me, too.

1169
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,600
Hey, Peyton?

1170
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,100
Yeah, buddy.

1171
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,480
I'm sorry I've been
such an asshole to you.

1172
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,749
You haven't been,
dude. You're...

1173
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,180
You're fine.

1174
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,359
Don't... Don't
even worry about it, man.

1175
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,330
Come on. Let's go.

1176
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:27,120
So, we got one more day
before you have to go back.

1177
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:31,390
What do you want to do?

1178
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,360
I don't know.

1179
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,499
How about I introduce you
to some of my friends.

1180
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,229
I think you'll really dig 'em.

1181
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,130
They're super chill people. Huh?

1182
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,740
Sounds perfect.
