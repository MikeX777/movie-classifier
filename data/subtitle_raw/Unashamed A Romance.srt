1
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,720
Oh, you needn't bother.

2
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,921
I had on my service lipstick.
- Yeah? Well, I'm not going to .. Hic!

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,360
Dick.

4
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,472
You'd better take it easy.
You're beginning to smell like a bar.

5
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,845
Oh, I can take care of myself alright.

6
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:18,856
Goodbye.

7
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,258
How was it?
- You were wonderful darling.

8
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,566
You and Joan dance
so beautifully together.

9
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:37,467
Jealous?

10
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,673
Don't be silly. Your own sister?

11
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,483
Let's get out of here.

12
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,945
Just as lovely as ever. You haven't
changed a bit in two days.

13
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,680
It seems like two years.

14
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,166
Why haven't I heard from you?
Where have you been?

15
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:13,343
Away on business.

16
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:17,506
We decided not to tell your people how
things are just yet so I didn't write.

17
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,007
Let's tell them now.

18
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,248
Darling, I can't go to your
father now when I'm a nobody.

19
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:26,238
When I have nothing but a reputation for
playing cards and riding Polo ponies.

20
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,362
That doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters.

21
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,297
Even if I tell your father I've decided
to settle down. To give up gambling.

22
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:36,217
To go in business for myself. It won't
matter to him. He wouldn't believe it.

23
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,265
It matters to me and I believe you.

24
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,180
But, Joan.

25
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:44,136
Joan. You'd better give me up.
I'm not good enough for you.

26
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,796
Why, Harry.

27
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,172
No Joan. No, don't give me up.
Don't let me go.

28
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:51,599
My whole future is in your hands.
You are my hope. My salvation.

29
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,655
Why, of course I won't give you up.

30
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,967
Harry, you're always in my
heart, always in my thoughts.

31
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:57,958
Joan.

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,126
Joan.

33
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,036
Oh.

34
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,910
Harry, this is my brother.
- I know him.

35
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:06,767
Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Dick.

36
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:09,701
I didn't know you knew him.
- I didn't know you knew <i>him</i>.

37
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,982
Harry.

38
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:14,436
You know when a younger brother puts
on long trousers he turns into a boy.

39
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,212
Don't think he doesn't force me.
Don't you, darling.

40
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,585
Not any more than you need.

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,267
I've got to keep my eye on you.

42
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:22,109
Don't you think I ought to, Harry?

43
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,821
If I had a sister as lovely as yours
I'd never take my eyes off her.

44
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,057
Ouch.

45
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,022
Come on, darling. You know,
he'll start preaching in a minute.

46
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,840
Oh no.
- You little sweet.

47
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,585
Oh Joan, cut it out.
- You don't like to be teased?

48
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,644
No.
- Alright.

49
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:38,693
Tomorrow?

50
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,240
Hmm.

51
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:44,310
Come on, handsome. I'm going to
take you home and put you to bed.

52
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,843
I say, Swift.
- Yeah?

53
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:51,600
Well, what are you doing out here?

54
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,110
Enjoying the moonlight?
- Nope.

55
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,245
Just talking to three million dollars.

56
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,314
And not bad looking, either.

57
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:15,528
Ah! What's that?

58
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:17,470
Get up. We're going riding.

59
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,419
I'm not.
- What?

60
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,214
Are you going riding?

61
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,262
No.

62
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:28,672
Wake up!

63
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:32,691
Dick.

64
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,771
Do you remember anything
at all about last night?

65
00:05:36,174 --> 00:05:36,819
Uhuh.

66
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:40,336
Now just because I like a man ..
- It depends on the man.

67
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:42,732
You are my sister.
- What of it?

68
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,303
Well, I want to take care
of you and protect you.

69
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,520
Can you get that through
your thick head?

70
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,238
It's seeped through a little.

71
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,390
What is it?

72
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,353
Well he's no good. That's all.

73
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,714
Nobody knows where he comes from.
All we know about him is he's ..

74
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,543
A gambler who plays Polo and
raises the devil with women.

75
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:01,717
I don't believe it.

76
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,641
Now Dick, you're going to be
married and Marjorie forgave you.

77
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,756
This is different.

78
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,404
You are my sister.

79
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,479
And you're more careful about me
than the girl you're going to marry?

80
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:14,999
Well, I know all about Marjorie.
I'm not going to harm her.

81
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:17,466
Nobody is going to hurt you.

82
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,334
Nobody. Ever.

83
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:26,968
Alright. Go back to sleep.

84
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:28,917
I'm going to go riding alone.

85
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:30,690
Bye.
- Goodbye.

86
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:37,944
Good morning, father.
- Hello, dear.

87
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,865
That's all I want, Adams.

88
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,688
Did you have a good
time last night, dear?

89
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,525
Perfectly wonderful.

90
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:14,493
Tell me darling. How long have you been
running around with this Harry Swift?

91
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,028
Not long.

92
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:22,122
That's different.
I thought it was serious.

93
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,951
Are you being the stern parent?

94
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,286
No, but I'm not going to
be a darned fool either.

95
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,013
Joan, you don't know much
about fathers, do you.

96
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,875
I know a lot about you.

97
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:41,317
I don't want to be sentimental
and talk like a darned fool.

98
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,794
But for 23 years I've been trying
very hard to make you happy.

99
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:46,720
You've been wonderful.

100
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,563
As far as I can see that's going to
be my job for the rest of my life.

101
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,658
Keeping any eye on you.
Seeing you don't fall on your nose.

102
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,902
Or stub your toe.
Any of the things girls do.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,969
You see?

104
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,566
You think I'll stub my toe?

105
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:01,279
I'm going to take darned
good care that you don't.

106
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,993
Now, you wrap that up in
your cigarette and smoke it.

107
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:08,314
Alright Dad, I will.

108
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,283
Darling, keep away from that man Swift.

109
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:15,536
He's no good.

110
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,037
Some of these .. And ..

111
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,411
Some of those.

112
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:35,847
And a dozen roses.

113
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,836
And that bunch there.

114
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,714
And ..
- For Miss Ogden?

115
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,243
Of course.

116
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:42,842
And some of those.

117
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:44,981
Let me see.

118
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,600
Hello Sis.
- Hello.

119
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,267
Hmm.

120
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:58,928
Looks like a flower shop.

121
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:01,630
It smells like ..

122
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,766
"<i>Because of you it is
springtime in my heart</i>."

123
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:05,783
"<i>Harry</i>."

124
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:07,825
Springtime in his heart?

125
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,234
Why, I think it's beautiful.

126
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:12,101
Yeah, if he had a heart.

127
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,460
Now listen, Sis. Sis, wait a minute.

128
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:19,012
Now listen. You know, that
bird is after your money.

129
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:22,261
Why you've got a girl. Go and
preach to her and let me alone.

130
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,236
Another breath of spring?

131
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:55,290
Say it again.

132
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,689
I love you.

133
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,111
Let's get out of here.
- Where?

134
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,705
How about my place, darling?
You've never seen it. Come on.

135
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,628
Sir, are you luring me?

136
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,762
Oh, you know that ..
- Darling.

137
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,203
Because I love you
doesn't make me an idiot.

138
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,519
Of course I'm not going to
your rooms at this time of night.

139
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:22,121
What did he want?
- I don't know. He said it's personal.

140
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,980
He wrote something on
the back of the card.

141
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,989
Well, tell him to come in. And I don't
want to be disturbed until he goes out.

142
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:42,814
Come in.

143
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:51,511
Mr Ogden?

144
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,670
I've come to ask a great favor from you.

145
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,194
I want your girl to leave my boy alone.

146
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:58,790
What?

147
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,850
My boy goes around with
your girl all the time.

148
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:02,682
They place Polo, they dance.

149
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,109
I tell you Mr Ogden, it's no good.

150
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,193
Won't you sit down?

151
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:08,773
Yah.

152
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,419
Maybe it's better we
should talk friendly.

153
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,872
I think so too, Mr Schmidt.

154
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:15,723
Will you have a cigar?

155
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:19,485
Thanks. Not now. After we've
finished talking maybe so. I hope so.

156
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:22,550
Well?

157
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:25,483
Mr Ogden, you have a boy, yes?

158
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,477
You are fond of him?

159
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,069
He means a great deal to you?

160
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,287
Yes. A great deal.

161
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,282
I have a boy too.

162
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,176
I think you know him, Mr Ogden.

163
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:36,742
He calls himself Harry Swift.

164
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,446
But he was christened August Schmidt.

165
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,274
He is ashamed by that name now.

166
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,410
All my life I pay for
that boy, everything.

167
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:48,036
He's a college boy.

168
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,156
Regular clothes, they
aren't good enough for him.

169
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,975
He's got tailors and shirt-makers.

170
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,782
Mr Ogden, he even has
his doors made to order.

171
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:00,665
I pay his gambling bills.

172
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,841
But I do all that because
in here, I say to myself ..

173
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,276
Someday he wakes up.

174
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,998
Someday that boy comes back
to Papa and the grocery store.

175
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,904
And then he marries a
nice little German girl.

176
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,246
And gives me a lot of grandchildren.

177
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,025
Then we'll all be happy.
- I see.

178
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:21,109
That's my dream.

179
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,982
And I see now he is with
your daughter all the time.

180
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,609
Mr Ogden, you have a lot of money.

181
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:31,106
If that boy of mine gets money he
will never come back to me. Never.

182
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,231
That's what I've come about.

183
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,701
Make your girl give up the boy.

184
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,142
Send him back to me.

185
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,963
I'm an old man.

186
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,651
Give me the great
happiness in my old days.

187
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:43,775
Let me take my boy back.

188
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,610
I don't want him.
Take him back by all means.

189
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:50,155
Thank you.

190
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,922
Now maybe I take that cigar, yah?

191
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,328
Thank you.

192
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,696
Dad, I want a lot of money.

193
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:00,754
Oh.

194
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,801
Oh, I beg your pardon.
- Joan.

195
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,069
My dear, if I'd arranged your arrival
it couldn't have been more opportune.

196
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,230
This is my friend, Mr Heinrich Schmidt.

197
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,581
How do you do, Miss.
- How do you do.

198
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:17,922
Joan.

199
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,445
Mr Schmidt came to ask me a great favor.

200
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,730
He wants me to make you give up his son.

201
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,354
Well, that ought to be easy.

202
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,419
I don't know his son.

203
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,806
He's the young fellow you've
been running around with.

204
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,240
His name is Harry Swift.

205
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,768
Yes, Miss Ogden. He is my boy.

206
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,479
Well how could his name be Swift?
- It isn't his name.

207
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,686
He just takes it like he takes
everything else he wants.

208
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,368
Just reaches out his hands and takes it.

209
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,097
Well, lots of people do that.

210
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,390
If they don't like their own
name they change it.

211
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,136
He is ashamed of his own.

212
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,725
Please, Miss. Send him back to me.

213
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,124
I think I had better attend to this.

214
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,341
Leave it to me.

215
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,686
Yah. That's better.

216
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:05,998
I'll go.

217
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:11,300
Goodbye, young lady.

218
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,787
So you're Harry's father?

219
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,746
Yah. I am his father.

220
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,131
And that is what I'm thinking
about all the time.

221
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,959
I am his father.

222
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,914
Well, what are you going to do about it?

223
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,911
I don't care what his father is.

224
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,986
Don't you care what kind of a son he is?

225
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:41,567
Dad, I don't care what he's been.

226
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:43,314
His family, his women.

227
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:44,769
His past is over.

228
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:48,057
I'm just looking forward
to a beautiful future.

229
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,404
I hope you get it.

230
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,249
Joan.

231
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,577
Joan. I'm not going to
let you marry that man.

232
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,146
I'm 22 years old.
- Yes.

233
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,380
But you don't get any money if you marry
without my consent before you're 25.

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't care.
- It's 3 million dollars.

235
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,994
Don't you want the money?
- Yes, but I want him too.

236
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:19,408
You can't have both.

237
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:23,286
Oh darling, darling. Don't be a
fool. This man hasn't got a nickel.

238
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,928
Except what he makes playing bridge
or wheedles out of his poor old father.

239
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:28,855
How are you going to live?

240
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,013
I thought you loved me.

241
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:32,168
I do.

242
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:36,846
Oh, suffering catfish. Now don't
make me act like a stern parent.

243
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:40,954
Don't you know I want to hold you in my
arms and comfort you and protect you.

244
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,349
I don't want to hurt you.

245
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,628
You are my little girl.

246
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,389
Well then, Dad. Don't. Don't.

247
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:52,145
Joan .. You can't have that man.

248
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:55,643
[Door knocks]

249
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,051
Wait. Wait, I'm coming.

250
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,792
Hello, Pop.

251
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,616
August, you come home?

252
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:17,018
I want to have a talk with you, Pop.
- I want to have a long talk with you.

253
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:18,795
And I want to see you too.

254
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,714
Come on in the sitting room.

255
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,000
Just as cosy as ever.

256
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,591
Yah, it's a nice place
but kind of empty.

257
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,568
I don't like living here alone, August.

258
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,765
I want you to come back.

259
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,029
Well I'd like to come back,
Pop. You know that.

260
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,091
Only I've got to make
my way in the world.

261
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:48,658
I've got to amount to something.

262
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,546
Now, you want me to be
a big man, don't you?

263
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:52,856
You wouldn't want my
education wasted, would you?

264
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:56,063
Maybe if I hadn't educated you,
you would be with me now.

265
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:57,875
I know, Pop.

266
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,649
Here's what I must see you for tonight,
Pop. I've got the biggest chance to ..

267
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,123
If it's more money: no.

268
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,474
Mother.

269
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:24,936
Beautiful, ain't she.

270
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:26,983
Beautiful.

271
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,393
Pop.

272
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:32,550
What I came for is to see if you'd
let me have two thousand dollars.

273
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,225
Well, I answer that very quick: No.

274
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,455
But I need it, Pop.
- No, you don't.

275
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,192
You think you do but you don't.

276
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,289
Playing along with rich people.

277
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:44,575
Well I've fixed it so you don't
go around with them no more.

278
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,290
I go and see Mr Ogden today.
Yah, and I see the girl too.

279
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,110
You did what?
- I go and see Ogden today.

280
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,039
What did you tell him?

281
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,847
You didn't say I was your son, did you?
- Sure. Yah, I tell him that.

282
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:00,106
I've a good mind to ..
- Yah, go on.

283
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:02,848
Hit me. It wouldn't be the first time.

284
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,220
But if you ever do it again.

285
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,326
You don't get a cent of my money. Never.

286
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,826
Pop, you know I wouldn't hit you.

287
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,651
Only, what did they say when you
told them that? What happened?

288
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,094
Nothing.

289
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,155
The girl says she don't care.

290
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:25,980
The Papa looked kind of funny.

291
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,188
I don't think the Papa likes you.

292
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,953
Ha .. I know that.

293
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,510
But I'll make him.

294
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:35,203
You mean you want to pay the Papa
two thousand dollars so he'll like you?

295
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:36,882
Of course not.

296
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:38,491
Don't you see, Pop?

297
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,082
I must get established in some
kind of a business. Have an office.

298
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:43,692
What do you do in an office?
Smoke cigarettes?

299
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,383
Don't you understand, Pop?

300
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,385
The girl is crazy about me.

301
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:50,804
Thinks I'm wonderful.

302
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:53,468
And she's worth three million dollars.

303
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:57,249
Think of it, Pop. A girl worth three
million dollars crazy about me.

304
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,032
She'll do anything I tell her to do.

305
00:18:59,256 --> 00:18:59,899
Nope.

306
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,222
Nope. I won't loan you
money for nothing like that.

307
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,673
Why not?

308
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,282
Your rents come in. You're making
plenty of money, aren't you?

309
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,701
Well, I'm doing pretty good.

310
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:11,476
Pop.

311
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,986
You know that if mother were
here she'd tell you to do it.

312
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,979
Yah, she would say it.

313
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,195
Also she would say it if you said:

314
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:21,848
"Papa, give me your right eye".

315
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,277
Your Mama would say ..

316
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,098
"Give it to the boy if he wants it."

317
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,908
"You don't need but one eye."

318
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,051
Don't you love me anymore, Pop?

319
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:30,776
Yah, that's the trouble.

320
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,323
All the time since you was
a little fellow, I love you.

321
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,372
I never cared for anything
in the world but you.

322
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,767
August, I tell you my heart
is aching with love for you.

323
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,315
You sure I'll get my money back?
- Of course you'll get it back.

324
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,574
Well.

325
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:48,309
Okay.

326
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:50,349
I'll get it for you.

327
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:52,966
You stay here with Papa tonight.

328
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,296
I get you the money
first thing in the morning.

329
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:56,554
That will be fine, Pop.

330
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,175
I'd love to stay here tonight.

331
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:00,914
My old room.

332
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,659
Just like when I was a kid.

333
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,273
Yah. That's good.

334
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,282
I'm so happy.

335
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,526
My August is home again.

336
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,115
Mr Swift.

337
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,431
I came as soon as I got
your message, Mr Ogden.

338
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,224
I won't ask you to sit down.

339
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,102
What I have to say to you
will take but a minute.

340
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,354
In the first place.

341
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:50,393
If you've thoughts to marry my daughter,
put them out of your mind immediately.

342
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,016
You can't have her.

343
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:54,088
Why not?

344
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,615
I don't like you, Mr Schmidt.

345
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,688
Swift .. If you don't mind.

346
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,256
Your name is Schmidt isn't it?

347
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,086
And your father is a grocer.

348
00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:03,715
That's my business and his.

349
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,745
If I choose to change my name for
business purposes that is my affair.

350
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,406
And what is your business?

351
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,250
I'm a promoter.

352
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,254
Are you doing well?
- Well enough.

353
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:17,013
Have you something you'd like promoted?

354
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:20,235
I sent for you to tell you
to keep away from my girl.

355
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:23,587
I won't do that.
- I'll not let you marry her.

356
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:24,873
Yes, she told me.

357
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:26,874
But she is of age.

358
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,258
You can't stop her.
- How will you live? You have no money.

359
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:31,805
I have enough.

360
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,809
I made two thousand dollars today.
- How?

361
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:36,728
Promoting.

362
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,633
See here, Mr Ogden.

363
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:40,735
I'm not after your money.

364
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,425
I'm in love with your daughter.

365
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,218
And whether you consent to our
marriage or not doesn't matter.

366
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,749
We can get along.

367
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,720
You don't believe that, eh?

368
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:54,021
See that?

369
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,394
That will keep us going.

370
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:59,695
Come on, Mr Ogden.
I'm not a fortune hunter.

371
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:03,202
Let Joan and me be married.
- I would rather see her dead.

372
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,141
You are no good and I know it.

373
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:07,899
You can't have her.

374
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:09,744
Now get out.

375
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,399
Good evening.
- Good evening.

376
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:43,529
Well?

377
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:45,457
You are lovely.

378
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:47,081
Lovely.

379
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:50,475
I hated to go away like this.

380
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:53,060
They'll worry about me.

381
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:54,948
I don't know what they'll think.

382
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:56,864
Don you see darling?
That's part of the plan.

383
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,649
I want them to worry about you a little.

384
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,660
Think how glad they'll be to see us
when they come back in the morning.

385
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:03,702
Maybe they won't see us.

386
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:05,219
Of course they will.

387
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,044
Everything is going to
be alright. Everything.

388
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,119
Believe me. I know what we're doing.

389
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,172
Dad. - What?
Dad.

390
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:36,882
What's the matter?
- She's not home yet. It's 3 o'clock.

391
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:37,826
Maybe she ..

392
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:40,343
You know darned well she isn't.
She wouldn't do a thing like that.

393
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,339
Do you know when Joan went for dinner or
out for an evening and didn't tell us?

394
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:47,460
Well, did you?
- No, I didn't.

395
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,493
Don't you see? Something has happened.
Nothing is missing from her room.

396
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:54,221
You know darned well she won't go away
without clothes. Not even a toothbrush.

397
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,295
Where you going?

398
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,799
I'm going to find her. That's
what I'm going to do. Find her.

399
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:06,709
Are you still worried, dear?

400
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:08,572
A little.

401
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,702
I wonder what father will say.

402
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,542
What can he say? We've been ..

403
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,269
Do I seem a terrible sinner?

404
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,620
You are the sweetest thing in the world.

405
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,611
Now stop worrying.

406
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,751
You know what your father will do?
What any father would do.

407
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,421
He will be horrified and insist
that we be married immediately.

408
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:30,350
Of course.

409
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,923
He'll force us to get married.
Think of it.

410
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:35,324
And we can have all my money.

411
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:36,773
Yes.

412
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:38,297
Yes. So we can.

413
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,346
But .. It won't be my
money or your money.

414
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,238
It will be <i>our</i> money.

415
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,030
<i>Our</i> lives.

416
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:46,671
<i>Our</i> happiness.

417
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,117
I'm so glad we've done this.

418
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:53,606
I knew you would be.

419
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,635
And now I want you to do just as I
tell you and everything will be fine.

420
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,101
We'll tell him what's happened.

421
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,901
But not a word about getting married.

422
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:03,523
Do you see, darling?

423
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,804
But we are going to
be married, aren't we?

424
00:25:07,904 --> 00:25:08,995
Of course we are.

425
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,295
Only don't you see? If we pretend
we don't care anything about it ..

426
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,281
He'll insist on our being
married immediately.

427
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:17,463
So that's it.
- That's it.

428
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,887
Now don't forget.
Let me do all the talking.

429
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,635
No matter what I say to him,
don't pay any attention.

430
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,246
It's only to force him
to make us get married.

431
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,184
I see. A shotgun wedding.

432
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,256
That's it.

433
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:31,958
A shotgun wedding.

434
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,418
We went away yesterday afternoon.

435
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,645
We went to a hotel together father.

436
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,598
We were there all night.

437
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,122
And now I suppose you want
to go out and get married?

438
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,848
Yes, if you will give us your consent.

439
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:57,109
You'll never get that.

440
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,035
Dad, don't say that. We must be married.

441
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:00,976
My dear, you've made
one terrible mistake.

442
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,625
I won't let you make any more.

443
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:05,680
Darling, can't you see he's trying to
force my consent so he gets your money?

444
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,196
I don't care about her money.

445
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:09,684
Then why don't you take her away
and marry her like a decent man?

446
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:12,266
Tell me to go to the
devil. She's of age.

447
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:13,958
I was thinking of her.

448
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:16,528
I can't give her the luxuries
you've always given her.

449
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:18,168
After all, it's her money.

450
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:20,399
Don't you see, dear? That's
all he wants, is your money.

451
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,967
Dad, it isn't. He loves me.
He wants to marry me.

452
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,471
I won't let you. He'd ruin your life.

453
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,429
I tell you dear, he's no good.

454
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:28,539
Scum.

455
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,059
Look at him.

456
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,617
Would a decent man stand there
crying: "I want the money for her"?

457
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,476
I can't deprive her of luxuries.

458
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:38,608
Can't you see what he is?

459
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:41,703
Come on Joan, let's get out of here.
- Yes, get out. But get out alone.

460
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,410
Dad, I can't find ..

461
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:45,583
Joan.

462
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,276
Oh, Joan.

463
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:49,985
Oh, Joan.

464
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:53,657
Where have you been?

465
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,577
I've looked for you everywhere.
All over the city. All night.

466
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,578
The police stations, the hospitals.

467
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:01,660
Joan.

468
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:04,263
There was a girl in the morgue.
I thought for a minute ..

469
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:07,956
How could you do this to me?

470
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,181
My dear, I didn't understand.

471
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,641
I wouldn't do anything
in the world to hurt you.

472
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:16,387
What's he doing here?

473
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:17,711
I came with her.

474
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,145
We've been away together.
Do you understand?

475
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,239
Your sister and I have
been away together.

476
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,272
We want to get married but your
father won't give his consent.

477
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,036
Well, what are you going to do about it?

478
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:29,695
You did that to my sister?

479
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,080
Now you get out of here.
Do you hear me?

480
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,617
Dad, careful of what you're doing.
Dad, we love each other.

481
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:38,389
Not without her. I won't give her up.
- She won't. You can't have her.-

482
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,169
I can.

483
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:41,775
My dear, what's happened has
happened. It will soon be forgotten.

484
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,178
No-one will ever know.
- Daddy, he loves me. I love him.

485
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:46,873
We'll keep it quiet. Hush it up.
- I've taken a good deal from you two.

486
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:48,007
All I want.

487
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:52,179
You'll hush it up. You'll keep it quiet.
No-one will know. Scum, get out.

488
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,169
I'll get out but I won't keep quiet.

489
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,584
Dad, he only talks that way
because he loves me. That's all.

490
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:58,643
I'll tell at the hotels and
the clubs. Everywhere.

491
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,778
Joan Ogden spent a
night with me in a hotel.

492
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,601
She is mine!

493
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:04,525
Tell them that, too. Tell them that!

494
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,224
Well, it's my life isn't it.

495
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,148
I wouldn't take Dallas
with all his reputation.

496
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,529
All he wanted me to do was the unwritten
law. Hide behind my sister's skirts.

497
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,533
I kicked out Andrews
for the same reason.

498
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:23,081
But you are our friend, Mr Trask.
You've known us all our lives.

499
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:25,085
We can't bring Joan into this thing.

500
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,808
We've got to keep her clear
of all this filth and dirt.

501
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:29,821
I'm begging you to help us.

502
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:33,941
I love Joan just as much as you do. You
don't suppose I want to see her in it.

503
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:35,791
Then find some way to keep her out.

504
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,199
Get some other defence. Do something.
- What defence have you?

505
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,651
I don't know. Find something.
You're a lawyer.

506
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,280
I killed a rat to keep
him away from my sister.

507
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,055
I'm not going to let you or any other
lawyer in the world drag her into it.

508
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:49,783
She's got to be kept out of it.
Do you understand?

509
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:51,884
You've <i>got</i> to keep her out of this.

510
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:57,066
He won't let you do it, eh?

511
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,283
He's going to tell you what defence
we're going to put up for him is he?

512
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:02,437
Why, that boy is a minor.

513
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,042
He has no say in the eyes
of the law. You know that.

514
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:07,412
The unwritten law. It's the
only defence you have.

515
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,298
I can make a jury cry its
eyes out with that story.

516
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,295
Then do it.

517
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:15,221
And your daughter?
- I'm fighting for my son.

518
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,857
That's all that matters. My boy's life.

519
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,449
Oh, Joan.

520
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:27,367
Joan.

521
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:28,979
Where are you going?

522
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,520
To Harry's funeral.

523
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:38,762
Joan, you mustn't go there, dear.

524
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,105
I can't let you do that?
- Why not?

525
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,654
Father, if I were being buried,
wouldn't you go to my funeral?

526
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:46,768
Yes. But I love you.

527
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,220
How do you think I feel about Harry?

528
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:53,614
Do you think there's anything I wouldn't
do to show the world my love for him?

529
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,700
Because of that man, she's turned
against me, against her brother.

530
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:02,305
Against her bringing up.

531
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:05,611
Everything in the world.
- Well.

532
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,496
Girls in love do that.

533
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:10,871
What about my boy?

534
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:12,785
Trask, you've got to save him.

535
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,113
I don't care what he says.
Don't discuss it with him.

536
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:16,822
You are right.

537
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,739
His only defence is the unwritten law.

538
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,561
Do you know what that will mean to Joan?
- She is to blame. It's her fault.

539
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,110
Whatever is said about her she will
live down and it will be forgotten.

540
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:29,482
It doesn't matter if they
put my boy in the chair.

541
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:32,282
Nineteen years old.

542
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,685
Everything in the world to live for.

543
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:38,875
Put me on the stand. I saw it. I know
what caused it. I'll tell the truth.

544
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:40,595
Put me on the stand.

545
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,728
Well, life goes on I guess.

546
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:06,911
Yah, yah.

547
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:11,059
Hans, pull up the shades.

548
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:15,080
I don't know why I bother but I guess
I got to keep the business running.

549
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:22,131
Better leave the door open.
It smells a little.

550
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:32,802
Well, nobody has to
ask if I keep Limburger.

551
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:36,323
A little piece for me
perhaps, Mr Schmidt?

552
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,123
Nein. I got no appetite.

553
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,767
Hans, it's a nice business.
We make money.

554
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:44,952
But my boy ain't here no more.

555
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:48,706
He is never going to stand where I'm
standing with a nice white apron on him.

556
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,362
He's gone.

557
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,187
And all for what?

558
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:55,103
He didn't hit the girl over the head.

559
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,554
She went with him because she wanted to.

560
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,460
And for that they killed my boy.

561
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:04,962
Well, I am going to be there when
they put that murderer in jail.

562
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:09,517
I'm going to look right straight into
his white face when they kill him.

563
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,108
That's my dream now.

564
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:16,159
He's dead and buried and I'm glad of it.

565
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:19,017
Do you hear that, Marjorie? Glad of it.

566
00:32:19,324 --> 00:32:20,053
My dear.

567
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,110
My dear.

568
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,661
Well Dick, what are we going to do?

569
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:28,308
What are we going to do?
- I have a great lawyer.

570
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,481
If Joan would only ..
- Joan is out of this.

571
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,514
I'm not going to have my sister's
name dragged into this at all.

572
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:35,973
But what about us, Dick?

573
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:39,441
You said we were going to be married.

574
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,961
Oh, I don't know. It's all
gone crazy. Everything.

575
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:46,039
Why did you shoot him?

576
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,842
Why did you?

577
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,170
I had my reasons.
- But I am in this too.

578
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,360
I am part of you.

579
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,240
You are the man I love, Dick.

580
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:57,386
Can't you talk even to me?

581
00:32:57,604 --> 00:32:59,306
There is nothing to
talk about, Marjorie.

582
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,898
I have the greatest lawyer in the world.
He'll get me out of it somehow.

583
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:05,867
We have nothing to worry about, dear.

584
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,263
I am going to Joan. That's what I'll do.

585
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:10,736
I'll go to Joan.
- Joan had nothing to do with it I say.

586
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:12,735
It had nothing to do with Joan.

587
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,463
Alright, Mr Ogden. Time is up.

588
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,903
Joan, I've just left the
man I love .. In prison.

589
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,054
I have just seen the man I love.

590
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:42,439
In his grave.

591
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,759
Oh, Joan dear.

592
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,644
We love each other so.

593
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,115
He means everything to
me and he's your brother.

594
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,850
What are you going to do?

595
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,881
Don't ask me! Don't ask me anything.

596
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:57,573
My brother has robbed me of everything
in the world I ever wanted. Everything.

597
00:33:57,673 --> 00:33:59,489
But he's your brother.
- That makes it worse.

598
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:01,371
What right had he to kill him?

599
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,680
I won't do a thing for him.

600
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,903
Nothing, nothing, nothing!
- Oh, Joan.

601
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:10,247
Joan.

602
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:13,716
Isn't there anything I can say that
will break down this calm of yours?

603
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:17,115
Haven't you any feelings?
It's your brother.

604
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,784
He killed my lover.
- Alright. He did.

605
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,477
But if you hadn't made him your
lover he wouldn't have killed him.

606
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:24,310
Joan. Listen to me.

607
00:34:24,943 --> 00:34:26,702
We've spent days getting a jury in.

608
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,988
They have sworn to give
your brother an even break.

609
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:31,745
They are going to treat him fairly
and they don't even know him.

610
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:33,518
You were brought up with him.

611
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:35,009
You played together.

612
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:36,788
He's your own flesh and blood.

613
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:39,383
And right or wrong, you've
got to remember that.

614
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,564
All I want you to do is
to go into that court.

615
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:44,617
Sit beside your own flesh
and blood and look at him ..

616
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:46,711
As though you didn't hate him.

617
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,929
That's all I have to do?

618
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,355
Just sit there day after day and
listen to the way Harry was killed.

619
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,399
I'll have all that horror
brought back to me.

620
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:58,217
And sit next to the man that killed him.

621
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,715
And smile at him.

622
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:03,647
That's what you want me to do?
- That's exactly what I want.

623
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,205
Alright, Mr Trask. I'll do it.

624
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,069
But that's all I'll do.

625
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,850
I'm very sorry lady, but there is no
more room. No-one else can go in.

626
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,669
As I already explained to you gentlemen,
this case is extremely simple.

627
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,591
I promise you to prove two things.

628
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:40,470
First, that Harry Swift is dead from
a bullet wound through the heart.

629
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:43,508
And second, that his death
was caused by a pistol.

630
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,363
Fired by Dick Ogden.

631
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:47,580
That gentlemen is our whole case.

632
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,389
I finish my opening address to you.

633
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,075
It is the shortest on record.

634
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,297
Gentlemen.

635
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,085
There is another matter I must mention
to you before I call my witnesses.

636
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,530
Judge Ambrose himself, when he charges
you, draw your attention to this matter.

637
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:48,563
But I feel at this time.

638
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,616
I should tell you gentlemen.

639
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:55,096
There is no such thing
as "the unwritten law".

640
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:57,068
Remember that, gentlemen.

641
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:58,588
All through this trial.

642
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,097
There is no such thing
as "the unwritten law".

643
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,518
Our laws are made for us by people
of our own selection. Our legislators.

644
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:10,394
They are made effective by the
signature of the governor of the state.

645
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:13,891
Nowhere do we find legislators saying ..

646
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:15,154
"This is the law."

647
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:17,821
"But we won't bother to write
it down or annoy the governor .."

648
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:20,104
"By asking him to validate
it to make it effective."

649
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:22,173
That, gentlemen, does not happen.

650
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,139
If we want a law to be
a law we make it so.

651
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,914
In other trials for murder men
have set up their defence ..

652
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:33,052
As "crazed by grief" or disappointment
or surprise, they killed a man.

653
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,218
And sometimes they
got away with the plea.

654
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,121
Once in a while but not
as often as they used to.

655
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,480
In foreign countries they
are even more liberal.

656
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,803
Only recently over there I believe
a lady killed her husband.

657
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:48,623
She shot him through the stomach as he
hadn't been home for a couple of days.

658
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:52,764
And the jury with wild
shrieks of acclaim said:

659
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,444
"Madam, go free."

660
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:58,872
"You are a rich beautiful widow.
Marry again by all means."

661
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,634
And if you don't like your
next husband .. Kill him too.

662
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:05,548
It's alright .. It's the unwritten law.

663
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,232
A woman has a right to be happy.

664
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:11,999
But gentlemen.

665
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:17,708
I know that you are not 12 hysterics and
I know that no such plea will move you.

666
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:21,674
From your stern sense of justice, or
make you violate the oath you've taken.

667
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,396
I don't know if this is the
defence of this young man.

668
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,446
I don't know what his defence will be.

669
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,133
But I do want to warn you gentleman
that perhaps they will say ..

670
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,962
That this boy killed a man in
defence of his sister's honor.

671
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:37,063
Gentlemen.

672
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,118
Look at his sister.

673
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,960
She's not a trembling little schoolgirl.

674
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,715
She is three years older than he is.

675
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,311
She is a woman used to society.
A woman of fine social position.

676
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:53,686
Gentlemen, she is a woman capable
to taking care of her own honor.

677
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:56,241
If she wants to take care of it.

678
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:58,773
I ask you to look at
her as she sits there.

679
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,758
Calm. Cool. Contained.

680
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,808
Ready for any emergency which
might come up in this trial.

681
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:10,641
Is there one of you who can say a man's
life must be taken to defend her?

682
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:13,209
Her honor is her own.

683
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:17,395
And the shortest word in the English
language will protect any woman's honor.

684
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,483
And that word is: "No".

685
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,929
Why, gentlemen. We must
not set up any precedent ..

686
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:29,375
Regarding the defence of a woman's honor
or what they choose to call their honor.

687
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:35,506
I guess every time a man took a girl out
and was late in getting home with her ..

688
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:38,403
Or perhaps didn't get home
at all with her that night.

689
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,539
Is he to be shot and killed for that?

690
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:42,905
Confidentially, gentlemen.

691
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,813
It would be pretty tough on
all of us now, wouldn't it.

692
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:53,058
Your Honor.

693
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,548
I move that all those remarks
be stricken from the record.

694
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,196
I think myself, Mr Harris ..

695
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,956
I realize Your Honor the error of
my remarks and I withdraw them.

696
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:05,317
Gentlemen of the jury,
consider my remarks as unsaid.

697
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:08,431
Only .. There is no such
thing as the unwritten law.

698
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,063
Dr Osgood.

699
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,709
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

700
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:16,452
I do.

701
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,263
You name is James W. Osgood and you
are the Medical Examiner of this city.

702
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,330
Yes.

703
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:23,550
What was the cause of death?

704
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:25,438
He had been shot through the heart.

705
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:27,707
Does a wound of that
sort cause instant death?

706
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,871
It is the most instant
thing you can imagine.

707
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,383
Alright. Somebody shot him through
the heart and killed him. Was that it?

708
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:34,323
Yes.

709
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:36,821
Any questions you gentlemen wish to ask?

710
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:39,367
Or are you satisfied that
this boy was killed instantly?

711
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:42,990
Alright, doctor. That's all. Thank you.

712
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,575
Your witness, Mr Trask.
- I have no questions.

713
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:46,843
Alright, doctor.

714
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:49,458
I've got to get out of here.
My wife is going to have a baby.

715
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:52,121
Captain Timothy Riorden.

716
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,261
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

717
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,238
I do.

718
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:02,873
Suppose you tell us all you
know about this case, Captain.

719
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,884
At about ten-thirty in the
morning of August 13th.

720
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:09,324
I was notified a man had been murdered
in the residence of Mr Richard Ogden.

721
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:10,182
I object.

722
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,246
Sustained.

723
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,001
Well Captain, can we put it this way:

724
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:20,336
You were notified that a man had been
<i>killed</i> at the home of Richard Ogden?

725
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,340
And that was it, wasn't it?
- No. I was told a man was murdered.

726
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,435
Nobody said anything to
me about being killed.

727
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:30,072
Captain, what His Honor means is we
do not want your opinion at this time.

728
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:32,420
Well, you're asking me what
I know and I'm telling you.

729
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:35,261
Counsellor, if you want me to,
I'll admit a man had been killed.

730
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:37,699
Is that better?
- I think that will do very nicely.

731
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:40,493
You went to the Ogden home
and you found a dead man?

732
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:44,160
Judge. If they let me tell it in my own
way we'll get through with this quicker.

733
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:47,760
My wife is in the hospital having
a baby. I'm in kind of a hurry.

734
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:54,068
I hope it's a boy, Captain.
- It doesn't matter, sir.

735
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,193
I got five or six boys now.

736
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,191
As I was saying, I went to the house and
found a fellow laying on the floor dead.

737
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:03,255
And there was a pistol laying there too.

738
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,308
And in the room was Mr Ogden.

739
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:07,325
Who is the defendant.

740
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,003
The girl that was his sister.
She was sitting next to him.

741
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,524
And the two officers that
telephoned for me to go up there.

742
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,969
Did you ask them what had happened?
- Yes.

743
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,913
Of course you understand that is
just a matter of form, Your Honor.

744
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,659
Any fool could see what had happened.

745
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:20,946
Is that how you knew it?

746
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,273
Your Honor, I object
to these interruptions.

747
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:25,814
The witness just said any
fool could understand it.

748
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:28,297
I asked him if that's how he knew it.

749
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:29,388
That's all.

750
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:32,467
Your Honor, I'm having
a terrific race with the stork.

751
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,055
I don't mind Mr Trask
having his little joke.

752
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,595
But you know, Judge.
- Alright, Captain. What happened then?

753
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,372
Well, I sent for the Chief
Medical Examiner.

754
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,381
And then I asked them who done it.

755
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:43,966
And none of them said nothing.

756
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:45,862
Then I took all their fingerprints.

757
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:47,721
And I found fingerprints
on the pistol too.

758
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:49,264
Whose fingerprints were they?

759
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,420
Young Ogden's.

760
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,668
And when I seen that I
turned to him and I said ..

761
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,297
"Why did you kill him?"
- Just a moment, Captain. One moment.

762
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:57,349
Did you caution this young man?

763
00:42:57,793 --> 00:43:00,553
Did you tell him that anything he may
say can be used as evidence against him?

764
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:01,698
Mr Trask.

765
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,747
I've been on the police
force for 14 years.

766
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,712
And I say them words in my sleep.

767
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:12,203
But there is no doubt in your mind that
the pistol was handled by the defendant?

768
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,237
My mind has got nothing to do with it.

769
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:16,717
There was only one set
of fingerprints found.

770
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,139
They young fellow's.

771
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:21,352
Later on we examined the bullet
that was in the heart and found ..

772
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,457
That it had been fired
from that same pistol.

773
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,483
That's all.

774
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,701
No questions.

775
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,205
Amanda Jones.

776
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:38,637
Oh Judge. It is twins!

777
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:45,922
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

778
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:47,574
Man, you talk awful fast.

779
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,070
He wants to know if
you will tell the truth.

780
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:51,531
Yes, sir.

781
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:56,853
You are employed in the
Ogden home as cook?

782
00:43:57,106 --> 00:43:59,306
I certainly am.
- How long you been employed there?

783
00:43:59,494 --> 00:44:00,402
Twenty years.

784
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:03,076
On the morning of August 13th.

785
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:05,529
You remember that day?
- No, sir.

786
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:09,135
I remember there was a 13th day
of August. Is that what you mean?

787
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,241
I mean the day the man was killed in
your house. You remember that day?

788
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,230
It seems like I do, kinda.

789
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:17,882
You mean to say that a man
being killed in your own house ..

790
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:19,871
Hasn't left an impression
on your memory?

791
00:44:20,178 --> 00:44:23,272
I told you that I kinda remembers it.
- Alright.

792
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:26,722
Now before the shooting, the
defendant went in the kitchen.

793
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:28,943
The which?
- The young man there.

794
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:33,144
Why Mr Sheriff, if you mean mister Dick,
why don't you say mister Dick?

795
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,913
Sure he come into the kitchen.

796
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:38,567
Did he go from the kitchen to the garage
and come back with a pistol in his hand?

797
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:39,526
No, sir.

798
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:43,047
What did he come into the kitchen for?
- Why Mr Sheriff, your honor.

799
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:46,398
The poor little lamb came into
the kitchen to get a glass of milk.

800
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,272
Just like a little baby he
wanted a glass of milk.

801
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:53,314
Do you know what perjury is?

802
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:54,507
Yes, sir.

803
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,363
Well aren't you committing perjury now?

804
00:44:56,558 --> 00:44:58,595
Me? In these hard times?

805
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,486
Lordy, Judge. I can't support
the husband I already got.

806
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,438
You know I can put you in
prison if you don't tell the truth.

807
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,893
You certainly can.

808
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:16,057
You certainly can put almost anybody
anybody in prison that you want to.

809
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:20,904
You took that poor lamb that ain't done
nothing to nobody and got him in jail.

810
00:45:21,382 --> 00:45:22,340
Strike that out.

811
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,336
Do you solemnly swear you didn't see
Richard Ogden with a pistol in his hand?

812
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:29,333
No, sir.

813
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:32,970
I never seen that boy with nothing
in his hand but a glass of milk.

814
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,054
That's all.

815
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:37,887
I said that's all. You can go.

816
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:50,327
Gentlemen, I told you this case
was going to be very simple.

817
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:51,673
You've heard it all.

818
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:53,223
Your Honor. The people rest.

819
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:00,648
Your Honor it is almost
noon and I'm hungry.

820
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,507
Perhaps we could now adjourn for lunch?

821
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:05,480
Your Honor, I object most seriously
to an adjournment at this time.

822
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,225
Proceed, sir.

823
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,459
I ask this case be dismissed
for lack of evidence.

824
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:12,072
There is no proof that a murder
has been committed at all.

825
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:13,477
Motion denied.

826
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,664
Your Honor will at
least note my exception.

827
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,849
I had already anticipated that.

828
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,108
Gentlemen.

829
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:28,007
I'm not going to talk
about this case at all.

830
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:31,435
I'm going to let the facts from my
witnesses speak for themselves.

831
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:36,035
Your Honor, I assure you that in my
defence I am relying on no laws.

832
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,558
That are not written.

833
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:42,406
Like you gentlemen, I was amused.

834
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:44,060
Interested.

835
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,141
And a little bit shocked.

836
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:49,528
At the District Attorney's remarks and
what he chose to call the unwritten law.

837
00:46:50,778 --> 00:46:53,135
To say the least, his
views are a bit unusual.

838
00:46:55,389 --> 00:46:57,852
How a mother must love a son like that.

839
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:03,214
What a pride his sister must take in his
views on the sanctity of maidenhood.

840
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,424
The decency of young womanhood.

841
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:09,729
And when his wife goes down on
her knees beside her bed at night.

842
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:14,321
Can't you imagine her prayer to the
Almighty God as she looks to heaven?

843
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:19,151
Oh Lord, I thank thee
for a husband like this.

844
00:47:24,778 --> 00:47:27,795
But now Your Honor if the District
Attorney still wants his lunch ..

845
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:30,775
Let him go and get it.

846
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:33,950
The court is now
adjourned until 2 o'clock.

847
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:44,678
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

848
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:45,719
I do.

849
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:48,778
Sit down, Dick.

850
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,646
Your name is Richard Ogden Junior.

851
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:53,695
You are the defendant in this case?
- Yes.

852
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,724
You are charged in
the indictment with ..

853
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:01,547
Dick, I am afraid we'll have
to speak a little louder.

854
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,812
One of the jurors doesn't
seem to hear so very well.

855
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:05,654
Can you hear better now, sir?

856
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:07,603
Yes, thank you. I can hear fine now.

857
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:12,618
You are charged in the indictment with
shooting Harry Swift through the heart.

858
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:14,676
Is that true?

859
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:18,096
Yes, sir.

860
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:20,922
Why did you kill him?
- There was no reason. I didn't mean to.

861
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:23,275
If you didn't mean to, why did
you shoot him in the heart?

862
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,063
I didn't know I was going to shoot
him at all. The pistol just went off.

863
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:28,688
You mean .. It was an accident?

864
00:48:29,077 --> 00:48:30,063
Of course it was.

865
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,028
How did it happen?

866
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,620
Honestly, Mr Trask. I don't know.

867
00:48:34,473 --> 00:48:36,600
Dick, don't you see that
that answer is absurd?

868
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:38,741
We object. The counsel is
instructing his witness.

869
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,331
He is intelligent enough to
tell his story in his own way.

870
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,066
Objection sustained.

871
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,193
Dick.

872
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,691
Tell these gentlemen exactly what
happened as near as you can recall it.

873
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:51,371
Well it was, just another case of a ..

874
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,464
A fool with a pistol.
He didn't know it was loaded.

875
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,276
I'm not asking you to
make excuses, Dick.

876
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:57,391
Tell the jury exactly what happened.

877
00:48:57,888 --> 00:49:01,530
What were you doing with a gun in your
hand? Where did the pistol come from?

878
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,366
Those are the things they want to know.

879
00:49:03,466 --> 00:49:05,811
Yeah .. I'd like to know about them too.

880
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:07,665
And you are going to know about them.

881
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:10,710
Go on, Dick.

882
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,600
Well, it was just after breakfast.

883
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:16,733
Dad an Joan had gone into the library.

884
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:19,480
I went upstairs for something
and when I came back again ..

885
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:22,478
Harry was in the room talking to them.
- What were they talking about?

886
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:23,778
I don't know.

887
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,609
I think Harry was telling Dad how well
Joan was learning how to play Polo.

888
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:27,648
I see.

889
00:49:28,324 --> 00:49:31,018
How did you get from the
subject of Polo to pistols?

890
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:33,113
I don't know exactly.

891
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:35,729
I'd been out before breakfast
shooting at a target.

892
00:49:36,216 --> 00:49:37,946
Where is this target
you were shooting at?

893
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,597
Back in the hills about
8 or 10 miles out of town.

894
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,538
Do you go there often?
- Pretty often.

895
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:45,659
Go on. Go on.

896
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:49,248
Well, I was telling Harry how
many bulls-eyes I'd been making.

897
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:51,353
He asked me what kind of a gun I had.

898
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,281
I told him I didn't know exactly.

899
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,717
It was one of Dad's. I hadn't
noticed the name particularly.

900
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,861
He was kidding me. He said he
didn't think I could hit anything.

901
00:49:59,279 --> 00:49:59,951
I got.

902
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,841
Kind of mad at this and told
him I was a darned good shot.

903
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:04,987
He and Joan were both laughing at me.

904
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:07,150
He said he didn't think
I even had a pistol.

905
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:09,993
So I pulled it out of my pocket
to show it to him and ..

906
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,000
Go on. What happened then?

907
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:14,908
I don't know.

908
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:16,662
Honestly, I don't know.

909
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,417
It just exploded in my hand
and Harry said "I'm shot".

910
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,908
Mr Trask, I'd tell you if I
knew but I can't remember.

911
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:26,694
I was so scared and ..

912
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,626
Kind of sick.

913
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,653
And there was no quarrel between
you and Harry Swift at all?

914
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:35,965
No, sir.

915
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:38,157
You had no reason for
wanting to shoot him?

916
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:39,434
Of course not.

917
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:43,474
That's all, Dick.

918
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:45,573
Your witness, Mr Harris.

919
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:52,551
You're sure there was no quarrel between
you and Harry Swift? - Yes, sir.

920
00:50:52,738 --> 00:50:55,511
You are certain the pistol went
off accidentally? - Yes, sir.

921
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:58,783
And you are equally certain both
of those statements are true?

922
00:50:59,045 --> 00:50:59,803
Yes, sir.

923
00:51:14,442 --> 00:51:15,840
Boy, Here is the pistol.

924
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:18,423
Show us how the accident happened.

925
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:21,419
You can take it in your hand safely.

926
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:23,057
This time it isn't loaded.

927
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:26,217
Now then.

928
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:29,042
Show the jury how it
went off .. Accidentally.

929
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:31,167
I don't know. I don't
know how it went off.

930
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:33,282
Well, let's see you pull the trigger.

931
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:35,476
You've been practising with it.
You've used it.

932
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:37,558
You know how to pull
the trigger don't you?

933
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:39,298
Well, pull it.

934
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,266
Thanks very much.

935
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:48,828
And still you say that you
had the pistol in your hand ..

936
00:51:48,928 --> 00:51:51,811
And without pulling the trigger or doing
anything else it went off accidentally?

937
00:51:51,911 --> 00:51:52,537
Yes.

938
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:56,060
You say that in spite of the effort it
took you to pull the hammer back at all?

939
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,005
I can't explain it but
that's how it happened.

940
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:02,421
I'm a little mixed on this.
Let me get it straight.

941
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:06,363
You say you took the pistol out of your
pocket and accidentally it went off ..

942
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:09,357
And accidentally the bullet went through
his heart and killed him. Is that it?

943
00:52:09,547 --> 00:52:10,248
Yes.

944
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:14,430
Well, I'll ask you to look at this
pistol. It's not an automatic, is it?

945
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,402
No, it isn't.

946
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:19,044
Well, do you think it could go off if
you just moved it around a little?

947
00:52:19,205 --> 00:52:20,344
Suppose you try that?

948
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:21,796
I object. I object!

949
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:25,174
The District Attorney has already had
this poor boy pull the trigger once.

950
00:52:25,544 --> 00:52:28,333
And brought back to him all the horror
of the accidental killing of his friend.

951
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:33,115
I've a right to make the defendant try
with this pistol as many times as I can.

952
00:52:33,677 --> 00:52:36,721
If he's telling the truth
let him show just once ..

953
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,643
How it is possible for this
hammer to fall accidentally.

954
00:52:39,913 --> 00:52:41,226
I'll go further than that.

955
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:46,437
If the defence can show, either by this
witness or an expert they wish to use ..

956
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:50,129
That it is possible for this pistol
to be discharged accidentally ..

957
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:54,001
I myself will drop the prosecution
and ask for acquittal.

958
00:52:58,364 --> 00:52:59,887
That's all, young man.
- Dick.

959
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,882
I have only one more
question to ask you.

960
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:05,006
You did not kill your friend
intentionally? - No, sir.

961
00:53:05,189 --> 00:53:08,385
And that pistol was discharged
accidentally? - Yes, sir.

962
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,845
And you had no reason whatever
for wanting to kill your friend?

963
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:11,747
No, sir.

964
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,805
That's all.

965
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:15,866
And still you say this pistol did
go off accidentally? - Yes, sir.

966
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,887
And you can't make it go off
accidentally any more, can you?

967
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:20,195
No, sir.

968
00:53:20,506 --> 00:53:21,160
Hmm.

969
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:22,440
No more questions.

970
00:53:30,753 --> 00:53:34,139
This court is now adjourned until
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

971
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:44,189
Listen, chief. Don't hit me in the eye.

972
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,769
But why don't you call the girl?

973
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:47,858
Call the boy's sister? You're crazy.

974
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:51,622
No, he's not crazy. That's been in the
back of my mind for a couple of days.

975
00:53:52,223 --> 00:53:55,146
She is not living at home.
She's staying at a hotel alone.

976
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:59,671
And she doesn't speak to her father and
doesn't talk to the boy except in court.

977
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,436
I've been watching that girl.

978
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,081
She's not with him.
- Awful risky.

979
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:05,911
What's risky about it
? If she defends
her brother they won't believe her.

980
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,288
We got that joy.

981
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,780
They don't believe the old man
and they don't believe the boy.

982
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:12,121
And if she comes out with the truth.

983
00:54:12,304 --> 00:54:15,100
If we get the real story of
that murder from <i>her</i> lips.

984
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:19,578
Well .. I'll sleep on that.

985
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,476
Son, I'm glad to see
you using your head.

986
00:54:23,353 --> 00:54:26,186
It would be pretty fine your
idea and suggestion ..

987
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:28,746
Put that boy in the chair, wouldn't it.
- You bet it would.

988
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:31,701
Alright, listen. Here is the
way we'll work on that.

989
00:54:32,056 --> 00:54:33,278
I can't help it, father.

990
00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:35,731
And you can say that after
being in court day after day?

991
00:54:35,831 --> 00:54:38,798
I've done all you've asked me to. I've
sat there and listened to a lot of lies.

992
00:54:39,186 --> 00:54:41,796
What good have they done?
- As much good as lies every do.

993
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:43,181
Dick tried to save you.

994
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:45,428
Dick saved me alright.
He smashed my whole life.

995
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:48,122
Joan, tomorrow the District Attorney
will likely call you as a witness.

996
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,098
What are you going to say?
- What must I say?

997
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:51,614
I want you to save your brother.

998
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,656
I want you to say that this man
would not leave you alone.

999
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,741
I won't do it!

1000
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:58,630
Harry was everything that was
good and kind to me. I won't do it.

1001
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,537
Joan, remember when
Dick was a little boy ..

1002
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,879
Father, I remember everything.
Every day of our lives.

1003
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:05,009
I can't forgive him and
I won't lie for him.

1004
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:07,365
What are you going to say?
- I'll tell them the truth.

1005
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:09,919
What is the truth?
- For no reason, Harry was killed.

1006
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:12,665
Do you honestly believe your brother
had no justification in this killing?

1007
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:15,159
I know it was a cold-blooded
murder for no reason at all.

1008
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:16,786
If they ask, I'll tell them that.

1009
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:18,557
Can you see what that testimony will do?

1010
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:19,958
I don't care.
- Wait. Wait.

1011
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:20,928
Wait.

1012
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:23,802
Sit down.

1013
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,954
Mr Ogden, you're not
doing any good here.

1014
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:28,665
You'd better go home.

1015
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:31,853
Joan and myself will discuss
this thing quietly and ..

1016
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:33,568
Maybe we can find a way out.

1017
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:35,465
Go on.

1018
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,463
It's no use pleading with me, Mr Trask.

1019
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,298
No.

1020
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:52,806
I can see that.

1021
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,430
Joan.

1022
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:57,753
How old were you when ..

1023
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,763
Dick was born?

1024
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:01,334
Three.

1025
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:04,569
What kind of a baby was he?

1026
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:06,942
He was sweet.

1027
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:09,537
That's not going to do
you any good at all.

1028
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:12,484
You don't mind me asking
a few questions, do you ..

1029
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:15,759
I've got to make some sort of an
appeal to the jury you know.

1030
00:56:16,283 --> 00:56:18,239
I don't know much about
that part of your lives.

1031
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:20,654
You were three, you say?

1032
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:21,846
Yes.

1033
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:24,277
That was the year your mother died?

1034
00:56:25,374 --> 00:56:27,744
There is no use trying to arouse
my sympathies by that.

1035
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:31,337
Mother died when Dick was born and I do
not remember one single thing about it.

1036
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:33,954
No. Of course you don't, my dear.

1037
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,652
Of course you don't.

1038
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:39,177
Since that time you've had
governesses and all sorts of people ..

1039
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:40,810
Take your mother's place.

1040
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,585
No. My father did that.
- Oh, I see.

1041
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:47,012
So, since Dick was born, your father has
been father and mother to both of you?

1042
00:56:47,636 --> 00:56:48,251
Yes.

1043
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,653
You feel very bitterly towards
him, don't you Joan?

1044
00:56:51,135 --> 00:56:52,264
I don't feel anything.

1045
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:54,928
It's going to be pretty
hard on your daddy, isn't it.

1046
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:58,459
Because unless you can save Dick,
he is going to the electric chair.

1047
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:01,392
A pretty sad finish for your father.

1048
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,034
He's given his entire life making
you two children happy.

1049
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:07,617
Not much reward in
this for him is there?

1050
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,182
You cold and estranged.

1051
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:12,462
Dick with his entire life ahead of him.

1052
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:14,428
A girl in love with him.

1053
00:57:14,587 --> 00:57:17,045
A girl that your father loves
and wants to take into the family.

1054
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:18,496
Joan.

1055
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,508
What will you say to the District
Attorney when he puts you ..

1056
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,653
On the witness stand tomorrow
morning and asks you ..

1057
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,668
"Why did your brother kill Harry Swift?"

1058
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:27,854
I'm going to tell him the truth.

1059
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:32,810
Then I can't save him.

1060
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,133
No appeal can save him.

1061
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:38,821
He'll be locked up in the death house
and he won't be able to see anyone.

1062
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:41,280
He won't even know
when the end is coming.

1063
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:43,350
You and your father.

1064
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,578
Will come and see him just once.

1065
00:57:46,606 --> 00:57:48,079
There will be guards watching you.

1066
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:51,180
And you will speak to him
through a grating six feet away.

1067
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,027
And Joan.

1068
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,633
You won't be able to kiss him goodbye.

1069
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:59,924
Then one morning at dawn they will come
to him. They'll say: "Come on, Dick".

1070
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,119
"It's time."

1071
00:58:01,842 --> 00:58:03,439
After a little walk down a corridor ..

1072
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:06,180
They lead him into the execution
chamber and place him in the chair.

1073
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,956
The Warden will say to him: "Dick".

1074
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:12,055
"If you've got anything to say,
this is your last chance."

1075
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:16,411
Only an all-seeing God may know what
reply he'll make to that question.

1076
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:18,669
I don't know.

1077
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:21,873
Then they'll put a
metal cap on his head.

1078
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:24,881
With wires sprouting out from it.

1079
00:58:25,675 --> 00:58:27,672
And they'll put a metal
band on his wrist.

1080
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:30,609
And they'll clamp it to the
arm of the chair like this.

1081
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:34,626
They'll put another metal band on his
shaven bare ankle and there he will sit.

1082
00:58:34,939 --> 00:58:35,742
Like this.

1083
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,034
And the Warden from another room will
give a signal. A man will pull a lever.

1084
00:58:39,272 --> 00:58:42,605
And your brother will burn to death
as the current goes through his body.

1085
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,895
Like this.

1086
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:46,977
I can't help it, Mr Trask.
I can't help it.

1087
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:50,233
My brother murdered Harry
Swift and I won't lie to save him.

1088
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:56,111
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

1089
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:57,057
Yes.

1090
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:00,775
Your name?

1091
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:01,934
Joan Ogden.

1092
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:03,586
And you are living?

1093
00:59:03,857 --> 00:59:05,066
I'm staying at a hotel.

1094
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:08,898
Then you are not living with
your father or under his care?

1095
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:10,010
No.

1096
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,000
And the defendant is your brother?
- Yes.

1097
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:17,683
You were home on the morning of August
13th when Harry Swift was murdered?

1098
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:19,285
Don't answer that question yet.

1099
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:20,956
We object.

1100
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:22,277
Sustained.

1101
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:23,514
Oh, alright.

1102
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:27,935
Miss Ogden, were you in the room
when Harry Swift was shot? - Yes.

1103
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:29,807
And you saw the shooting?
- Yes.

1104
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:34,459
I want you to consider your answer to
this question carefully, Miss Ogden.

1105
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:37,150
Was that shooting accidental?

1106
00:59:37,495 --> 00:59:38,103
No!

1107
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,898
Your brother shot Harry Swift
deliberately? - Yes.

1108
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,885
You understand perfectly what
you are saying? - Yes!

1109
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:48,160
You testify in this matter as you're not
willing to perjure yourself? - Yes.

1110
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:50,888
And again, you say your brother ..

1111
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:54,313
I tell you I saw my brother shoot him
in cold blood for no reason at all.

1112
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,190
That's all.

1113
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:02,668
If it please Your Honor.

1114
01:00:02,768 --> 01:00:05,307
I respectfully request the court be
adjourned until tomorrow morning.

1115
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:07,524
Your Honor, I object to an
adjournment at this time ..

1116
01:00:07,624 --> 01:00:09,927
Before I've had an opportunity
of cross-examining the witness.

1117
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,966
I see no reason at all why
we should not adjourn.

1118
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,621
I am quite sure, Mr Trask.

1119
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:19,340
That your very able cross-examination
of this witness ..

1120
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,254
Will be just as effective .. Tomorrow.

1121
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,981
The court is now adjourned.

1122
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,457
Dick.
- Wait a minute, Mr Trask.

1123
01:00:52,243 --> 01:00:54,324
I want to talk to my sister.
- Are you crazy?

1124
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,183
Don't you know she's just
condemned you to death?

1125
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:59,129
That's just why I want to talk to her.

1126
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:03,109
Joan.

1127
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:06,611
I just want to tell you that
everything is alright.

1128
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,621
I don't know what else you could
have done loving him the way you do.

1129
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,567
That's what I stopped you for.

1130
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:14,296
To try to make you understand that ..

1131
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:16,342
No matter what you've said or done.

1132
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,541
It's alright with me.

1133
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:21,050
I know you couldn't help it.

1134
01:01:21,484 --> 01:01:23,930
Maybe if it had been me I'd have
done the same thing. I don't know.

1135
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:25,602
But.

1136
01:01:26,635 --> 01:01:27,850
You are my little sister.

1137
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,093
Just as you've always been.

1138
01:01:30,993 --> 01:01:31,649
And.

1139
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:34,074
Whatever you did. You had to do.

1140
01:01:35,531 --> 01:01:36,517
And it's alright.

1141
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:46,540
Goodbye, Joan.

1142
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:04,063
Goodbye, Mr Trask. See you tomorrow.

1143
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,450
Yes. Yes, I've seen it, Mr Ogden.

1144
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:46,140
Let me go! I've got to speak to him!
Mr Trask, I've got to talk to you.

1145
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,784
I haven't time to talk to you.
I've got to be in court in 20 minutes.

1146
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:50,303
You've got to listen to me.

1147
01:02:50,504 --> 01:02:52,639
I've seen everything.
I've read the newspapers.

1148
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,206
I've seen the picture of the death
house. What are you going to do?

1149
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:58,537
You've got to save my brother.
What are you going to do?

1150
01:02:58,717 --> 01:02:59,618
That is funny.

1151
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,667
That's the first laugh I've had
since this trial started.

1152
01:03:03,043 --> 01:03:04,401
<i>I've</i> got to save your brother?

1153
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:07,586
You've put your brother in the electric
chair as surely as the warden does it.

1154
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,169
You've done nothing but
arouse hate for that boy.

1155
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:12,470
I told you not to go to that funeral.

1156
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:15,718
I begged you to sit beside him
in the court and be tender.

1157
01:03:16,153 --> 01:03:17,364
I had to have sympathy.

1158
01:03:17,888 --> 01:03:18,941
You sat there.

1159
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,338
With a hard face and killed that.

1160
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:24,577
And now you come to me at the last
moment whimpering like a beaten pup ..

1161
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:26,004
And cry: "save my brother".

1162
01:03:26,586 --> 01:03:29,737
You put your brother where he is because
of your own rotten love adventures.

1163
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:32,301
You sat there on the
witness stand and testified.

1164
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:35,026
That your brother didn't
shoot Harry Swift accidentally.

1165
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,796
That he killed him deliberately
and in cold blood.

1166
01:03:38,195 --> 01:03:40,020
You put your brother in the spot he is.

1167
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,398
You get him out.

1168
01:03:41,622 --> 01:03:43,823
I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

1169
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:46,554
I wonder if you would.

1170
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,385
Joan.

1171
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,061
How brave are you?

1172
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:53,028
I don't know.

1173
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:55,363
If I could show you a way
to save your brother's life ..

1174
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,648
I'll do anything, anything.
- I wonder.

1175
01:03:58,537 --> 01:04:00,182
I wonder if you would have the courage.

1176
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:02,552
Sit down, Joan.

1177
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:06,047
Joan, there is just one way
to save your brother's life.

1178
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:08,167
If we succeed he'll go free.

1179
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:10,629
But your life will be wrecked.

1180
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:12,794
You will be jeered at.

1181
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:14,356
Sneered at.

1182
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:17,386
People will call you foul names
when they see you on the street.

1183
01:04:17,561 --> 01:04:18,458
I don't care!

1184
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:21,322
And if we fail, your brother
will go to the electric chair.

1185
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,045
And still people will scream
at you and curse at you.

1186
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:28,415
Either way .. You're going to lose.

1187
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:29,477
I don't care.

1188
01:04:29,957 --> 01:04:31,617
Mr Trask, I don't care.

1189
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:36,185
Alright.

1190
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:38,010
Alright, Joan.

1191
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:41,589
Your Honor, before beginning the
cross-examination of Miss Ogden ..

1192
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:44,929
I will introduce newly found evidence
that has been brought to my knowledge.

1193
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,326
You are reopening the
case for the defence?

1194
01:04:47,456 --> 01:04:48,673
Temporarily, Your Honor.

1195
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,270
I will proceed with the examination
of this young woman later.

1196
01:04:51,531 --> 01:04:52,618
I will allow that.

1197
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,901
Your Honor, I object.

1198
01:04:54,614 --> 01:04:57,048
Suppose we wait and see
what the witness will disclose?

1199
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:58,475
Thank you.

1200
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:00,771
Heinrich Schmidt.

1201
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:04,196
Mr Schmidt, will you
take the stand, please.

1202
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:17,170
Do you swear to tell the truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

1203
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:18,011
I do.

1204
01:05:22,248 --> 01:05:23,153
Your name?

1205
01:05:23,873 --> 01:05:24,880
Heinrich Schmidt.

1206
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:28,924
I keep a grocery and delicatessen
store at 965 Main Avenue.

1207
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:30,556
How long have you kept that store?

1208
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,194
I've been in that place about 25 years.

1209
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,828
You are well known in the neighbourhood?
- Yah, they all know Papa Schmidt.

1210
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:39,884
Once, they wanted me
to run for Alderman.

1211
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:42,889
But I am too smart. I didn't do it.

1212
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:44,008
Mr Schmidt.

1213
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:48,340
Did you ever know a young man
by the name of Harry Swift?

1214
01:05:49,557 --> 01:05:51,903
Yah, but that wasn't his real name.
- No?

1215
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,848
What was his real name?

1216
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:55,263
August Schmidt.

1217
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:57,586
Oh, same name as your own?

1218
01:05:58,161 --> 01:05:59,543
Yah. He was my boy.

1219
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:04,111
I tell you gentlemen, he took
that other name because he ..

1220
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,688
Judge, I am an honest man.
I cannot lie about things.

1221
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:11,397
My boy was ashamed of
me and my business.

1222
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,540
Some bad feeling between
you and your son?

1223
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,159
No, nothing like that.

1224
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,821
I lent him 2,000 dollars the
day before he was killed.

1225
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:20,288
We were good friends, I was
always lending him money.

1226
01:06:20,572 --> 01:06:22,613
So you talked to him the
day before he was killed?

1227
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:23,441
Yah.

1228
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:26,188
Did he tell you what he
wanted this money for?

1229
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:28,521
He wanted to make a front.
- What for?

1230
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,601
He wanted to get himself an office.

1231
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,291
I tell you gentlemen, he
tells me that this girl ..

1232
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:35,206
What girl?
- That one over there.

1233
01:06:35,585 --> 01:06:37,648
You mean .. Miss Ogden?
- Yah.

1234
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:39,535
He tells me she was crazy for him.

1235
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:41,657
He says if he marries her
he gets 3 million dollars.

1236
01:06:41,757 --> 01:06:44,419
Did your son tell you Miss Ogden
was in love with him? - Yah.

1237
01:06:44,683 --> 01:06:45,933
Was he in love with her?

1238
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:47,217
I don't know.

1239
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:50,341
She ain't bad looking and she's got
three million dollars. I guess maybe ..

1240
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,148
I object to this line of examination.

1241
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:53,797
I think it is admissible.

1242
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,444
Go on, Mr Trask.

1243
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,316
What else did your son tell you?

1244
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,452
He tells me he got a chance
to get up in the world.

1245
01:07:01,082 --> 01:07:04,251
He says he makes Mr Ogden like him
by and by after he gets the girl.

1246
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:06,908
Did your son tell you that Miss
Ogden was in love with him?

1247
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:08,009
Sure.

1248
01:07:08,603 --> 01:07:10,996
Why not? He was a nice looking fellow.

1249
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:14,196
All my boy had to do was whistle
and the girls came running.

1250
01:07:14,436 --> 01:07:16,464
All of them.
- That's a lie, it's a lie!

1251
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:23,200
We'll let you tell us all about in
just a moment, young woman.

1252
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:29,821
You told me you loaned your son 2,000
dollars the day before he was killed.

1253
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,685
Yah. The police gave it back to me.

1254
01:07:31,985 --> 01:07:33,601
The police gave you back 2,000 dollars?

1255
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,793
Sure.

1256
01:07:35,648 --> 01:07:37,064
Did they give you anything else?

1257
01:07:37,173 --> 01:07:38,760
Some letters.
- What kind of letters?

1258
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:39,815
Bills.

1259
01:07:40,345 --> 01:07:42,270
Anything else?
- Yah. One other thing.

1260
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:43,940
I show it to you.

1261
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:48,213
A receipted hotel bill for Harry Swift
and wife the night before he was killed.

1262
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,450
He wasn't married.

1263
01:07:51,346 --> 01:07:52,533
He didn't have any wife.

1264
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:55,186
These rich people.
Keeping up with them.

1265
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,457
They want excitement. Noise.

1266
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:58,994
This is what come of it.

1267
01:07:59,853 --> 01:08:01,655
He goes to a hotel with that girl.

1268
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,174
He didn't drag her there.

1269
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:05,505
She wanted to go.
And they killed him for that?

1270
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:09,509
My boy loses his life for
that no-good woman.

1271
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:11,804
You're a liar. She is good.
She's always been good.

1272
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:14,977
You say what you like about me but keep
your dirty tongue still about my sister.

1273
01:08:15,244 --> 01:08:16,288
Let her name alone.

1274
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:17,707
Sit down.

1275
01:08:25,455 --> 01:08:26,270
Your Honor.

1276
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:29,357
I want to deeply apologise for this
outburst on the part of my client.

1277
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:32,896
I trust the court will understand it was
only prompted by this boy's great ..

1278
01:08:33,128 --> 01:08:34,900
Tender protective love for his sister.

1279
01:08:35,283 --> 01:08:38,049
The jury will disregard
counsel's explanation.

1280
01:08:38,683 --> 01:08:40,371
Don't let it happen again, Mr Trask.

1281
01:08:42,178 --> 01:08:43,342
That's all, Mr Schmidt.

1282
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,428
As a matter of fact, you don't know
who was with your son at that hotel ..

1283
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:49,620
Or why he was killed or
anything about it, do you.

1284
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,114
I know what's in my heart.

1285
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:52,822
Unfortunately that's not evidence.

1286
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:54,009
That's all.

1287
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,276
Now then, Miss Ogden.

1288
01:08:57,462 --> 01:08:58,849
Will you take the stand please.

1289
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:13,394
Miss Ogden, the last thing
you told the jury was ..

1290
01:09:13,494 --> 01:09:16,328
Your brother shot Harry Swift for no
reason at all. Shot him in cold blood.

1291
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,052
Did your brother say anything?

1292
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:19,717
Yes. He yelled at him ..

1293
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:21,616
"Tell them that too. Tell them that."

1294
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:23,088
What did he mean by that?

1295
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:25,704
Well it came out of an argument.

1296
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:27,218
Father had called Harry ..

1297
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,444
Well, he said some pretty hard
things to Harry and naturally ..

1298
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,408
Harry said if he didn't let us
alone he'd tell everything.

1299
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:35,710
Do you know what Swift
was going to tell them?

1300
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,057
Yes. That we'd been
away overnight together.

1301
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:39,139
Oh.

1302
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,549
For a little thing like that
your brother killed him?

1303
01:09:41,988 --> 01:09:42,708
Yes.

1304
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,399
Shot him in cold blood
for no reason at all.

1305
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:48,481
You're the bright boy
that suggested this.

1306
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,137
Well I thought ..
- That's it. You didn't think.

1307
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,525
Miss Ogden, let's get back
to the beginning please.

1308
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:57,910
You say you went away with Harry Swift
and were gone for the night? - Yes.

1309
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:01,048
When you returned in the morning you
were with your lover? - Yes.

1310
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:02,669
Did you tell your father this?

1311
01:10:02,843 --> 01:10:03,488
Yes.

1312
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:05,984
Was your brother present?
- I object to that question.

1313
01:10:06,605 --> 01:10:08,559
I think Mr Harris, I'll allow that.

1314
01:10:09,486 --> 01:10:11,481
I asked you Miss Ogden if
your brother was there ..

1315
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:14,635
When you made this disclosure about your
relations with Mr Swift to your father.

1316
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:16,443
Oh no. He came in later.

1317
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,261
What did he say when he saw you?

1318
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:21,379
Well, I didn't see that it
was any of his business.

1319
01:10:21,809 --> 01:10:24,996
But the little fool, why he
was crying and carrying on.

1320
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:28,435
He said he'd been all over town looking
for me. He called at the police station.

1321
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:32,829
He even visited the morgue and saw the
body of a dead girl he thought was me.

1322
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:36,541
Why he was so excited.
He wanted to know where I'd been.

1323
01:10:39,784 --> 01:10:41,006
What did you tell him?

1324
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:43,399
Well, I told him not to be so silly.

1325
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:46,237
That Harry and I had been away
together. That was about all.

1326
01:10:46,337 --> 01:10:49,408
What did he say to that?
- He made an awful fuss about it.

1327
01:10:49,836 --> 01:10:51,328
And he was so unfair to Harry.

1328
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:53,626
Why, he accused him of
wrecking my life and ..

1329
01:10:54,037 --> 01:10:55,655
Ruining my sense of morals and ..

1330
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,273
You know, things like that.

1331
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:01,106
And then suddenly without any warning
whatever he made a wild rush at Harry.

1332
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:02,768
You mean with the pistol his hand?

1333
01:11:03,052 --> 01:11:05,163
No, he didn't have anything
in his hands then.

1334
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:08,352
But he made this rush at Harry and
naturally I thought he would hurt him.

1335
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:11,006
So, in defending himself,
Harry sort of ..

1336
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:14,086
Pushed him in the face and
he went down on the floor.

1337
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,186
Are you sure Miss Ogden, that he
didn't strike your brother in the face?

1338
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,653
Well, possibly he did.

1339
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:21,457
And the blow knocked your brother down?

1340
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:25,128
I think so, or he tripped on something.
But anyway he went down on the floor.

1341
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:27,455
Then he got up and he
ran out of the room.

1342
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:30,178
What happened then?
After your brother left the room?

1343
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,732
Nothing. Nothing.

1344
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:34,521
I just told my father
not to be an old fogey.

1345
01:11:35,162 --> 01:11:38,548
And I think I said something about
marriage was old fashioned and ..

1346
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:40,439
And I didn't believe in it anyway.

1347
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:42,589
Then my brother came back into the room.

1348
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:45,392
What was your father's answer to
your remarks about marriage?

1349
01:11:45,913 --> 01:11:47,672
After your brother came
back into the room.

1350
01:11:47,862 --> 01:11:50,935
Well, he sort of took me by
the shoulders and shook me.

1351
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,129
He wanted to know what happened to me.
He said I'd not talked like that before.

1352
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,482
Was that the truth? You never
had talked that way before?

1353
01:11:57,018 --> 01:11:58,185
Oh, I guess it was.

1354
01:11:58,592 --> 01:12:01,572
Then what changed you? Why did you
begin to speak that way so suddenly?

1355
01:12:02,024 --> 01:12:05,853
Well, Harry and I had talked it over
and Harry didn't believe in marriage.

1356
01:12:06,074 --> 01:12:08,825
And he convinced me that there
wasn't anything to it anyway.

1357
01:12:09,051 --> 01:12:10,552
What did your brother say to that?

1358
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,594
He didn't say anything for a minute or
two. He just stood and stared at me.

1359
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,278
The what happened?
- Well ..

1360
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:20,174
Harry said he felt we'd better go and as
we neared for the door, Dick stopped us.

1361
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,963
He said: "Joan, this isn't you".

1362
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:25,351
"My little sister Joan
acting like this."

1363
01:12:26,348 --> 01:12:29,224
Now, he knew it was me.
Just silly. That's all.

1364
01:12:29,806 --> 01:12:32,538
And then he turned to Harry
in the most outrageous way ..

1365
01:12:32,638 --> 01:12:35,533
And accused him of wrecking
my life and ruining my morals.

1366
01:12:36,059 --> 01:12:38,461
He got between us and the
door and refused to let me go.

1367
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:42,350
Honestly, Mr Trask. You've never
heard such goings-on about nothing.

1368
01:12:42,678 --> 01:12:43,976
Nothing at all.

1369
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:47,657
And then when I said I was going and
it was none of his business at all ..

1370
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,526
Without any warning whatever ..

1371
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:51,615
He pulled out a pistol and shot Harry.

1372
01:12:51,864 --> 01:12:53,451
Miss Ogden, is this the truth?
- Yes.

1373
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,650
Then your brother shot your lover
deliberately and in cold blood?

1374
01:12:56,848 --> 01:12:57,486
Yes.

1375
01:12:57,796 --> 01:13:01,052
Miss Ogden, I want you to realise what
you've said before you leave this stand.

1376
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:04,871
Do you realize that your testimony may
send your brother to the electric chair?

1377
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,601
Do you understand that?
- Yes.

1378
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:09,465
And you still think that your brother
should go to the electric chair?

1379
01:13:09,756 --> 01:13:10,554
Yes.

1380
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:14,270
That's all, Miss Ogden.
- Can I go now?

1381
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,848
Yes, unless the District Attorney
wishes to question you further.

1382
01:13:16,948 --> 01:13:17,653
No.

1383
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,891
I hope you get yours. You will someday.

1384
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,263
If you were mine, I'd kill you.

1385
01:13:48,288 --> 01:13:49,888
I guess they freed him.
- I guess so.

1386
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:55,139
Well, I'm glad he got off.
- A just murder.

1387
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:16,578
Well .. You win.

1388
01:14:17,018 --> 01:14:18,966
Thank you, Harris. Thank you.

1389
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,177
My boy, you're free. You're free.

1390
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:26,814
In spite of your sister.

1391
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:28,794
No, not in spite of her
but <i>because</i> of her.

1392
01:14:29,654 --> 01:14:30,726
That's right, Ogden.

1393
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,422
If Joan hadn't deliberately torn every
vestige of decency from her character ..

1394
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:37,328
Your boy would be ..
- What do you mean "deliberately"?

1395
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,188
Joan was willing to do anything.

1396
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,491
I explained to her our
one chance to save him ..

1397
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:44,037
Was for her to get herself so low
and despised by that jury that ..

1398
01:14:44,374 --> 01:14:46,646
In contrast to Dick, they set him free.

1399
01:14:47,008 --> 01:14:47,935
It worked.

1400
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:51,071
But I'm afraid that Joan has paîd
a price the world will never give back.

1401
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:52,444
Oh, I knew it, Dad.

1402
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,197
Where is she now? Where is she?

1403
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:56,856
I sent her home, where she belongs.

1404
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:04,945
Joan.

1405
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,441
Joan!

1406
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:16,424
Well Joan, how can I ever ..?
- It doesn't matter, Dick.

1407
01:15:16,706 --> 01:15:19,222
Nothing matters now. You're free.

1408
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:21,900
Hallelujah!

1409
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,690
T-G oö
