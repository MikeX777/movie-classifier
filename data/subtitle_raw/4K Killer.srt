can you tell me a little bit
about the murders?

Um... well I guess

57
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,288
the cops might think it is a
serial killer at this point

58
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,325
Just because of how many

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,949

00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,123

steal anything so

112

either it was like
some personal mission

get the house they

know the offer

that was probably the

trying to hang on to

00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:25,486

feeling like really

229
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,731
woozy and just and I
I fell down to my

230
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:35,151

to just maintain

231
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,153

I looked kind of

this guy just all

00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:51,650

pointing a bow and

235

kind of that's when I

237
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,555
realized that um he
shot me

238
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,420
did you see his face?

had turned around

his bag and that's

00:36:23,008 --> 00:36:25,597

survival mode just

275
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,944
kicked in you know
like I'm not gonna be

276
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,981

I'm gonna survive.

I'm gonna get out of here

00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:42,786

reached for the

279
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:46,376

find that I had

280
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,792
this strength to grab
and just like my

281
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:52,969
brother showed me I
just took it and as

282
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,489
soon as the guy
turned around I just

283
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:58,664
clocked him as hard
as I could I mean it

284
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:01,840
was hard because I
had these arrows in me.

285
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:05,050

to the ground so I

286
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:07,190
know I got him really hard

287
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:51,096
I started to run away
but after that it

288
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,962
just kind of it's a
blur... um just

289
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,653

on was...

nails or anything, so it's
like this person just...

360
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:43,592
I don't know...
didn't even give anybody
a chance

361
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:45,559
to escape.

362
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:50,219
Reporter: so are you saying that
it was just cold blooded murder

363
00:50:50,254 --> 00:50:51,910
in every single case?

364
00:50:51,945 --> 00:50:54,189
yeah that's exactly what
I'm saying

365
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,239
Anchorman: Emily Boone 28 was
found murdered in her back yard

366
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:13,035
in her rural hometown of
Fountain Green.

367
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,418
She was stabbed several times
in the back and left outside.

368
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:20,456
she was discovered hours later
by her neighbor

369
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,010
police are searching
the area for the killer

370
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:25,289
and have asked
the locals to stay

371
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:28,361
alert and on the
watch for anything suspicious

372
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:30,397
there were three
sightings of a drone

373
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,813
flying in the vicinity
of Emily's home

374
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:35,609
close to the same
time as her slaying.

375
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:38,336
police speculate that
the drone may have

376
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,442
been used by the killer
to scout out the

377
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,754
area previous to the murder.

378
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:45,688
There hasn't been a killing in
over six months.

379
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:48,105
why do you think that is?

380
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,833
I don't know... I mean

381
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:55,560
you see those crime
docs where the

382
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:58,494
serial killer kind
of goes on a spree

383
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:00,807
and then goes into hiding for an

384
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:05,260
extended amount of
time and I mean it

385
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:09,436
could be something
like that where he's

386
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:13,889
just enjoying the
media coverage and

387
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,925
I don't know or maybe
he's scared he's

388
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,099
gonna get caught

389
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:22,794
[moaning]

390
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:27,213
Man: Ohhh... my head hurts.

391
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,009
[Music]

392
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:35,324
he's gonna come back
but honestly if he

393
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,326
comes out of hiding...

394
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,466
good luck.

395
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:41,296
Reporter: What does that mean?

396
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,781
I'm gonna be ready
for him

397
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,129
I'm going to shoot him
right in his face.

398
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:56,103
[moaning]

399
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,696
Reporter: So I see you've got
something right there

400
00:53:02,731 --> 00:53:04,698
can I go ahead and
zoom into that?

401
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:06,113
The gun?

402
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:07,908
Reporter: yeah yeah so
tell me about it

403
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:12,844
this is my 9-millimeter
Glock I got

404
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:18,022
so I don't go anywhere
without it

405
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:20,680
Reporter: so you feel safe
with that then?

406
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:23,061
yeah damn right I do

407
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:25,926
Last time. I wasn't prepared
and

408
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:29,689
it's not gonna happen again

409
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,829
Who are you?

410
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:40,286
Reporter: Now.... here is the
burning question

411
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,874
do you see
any connection or

412
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:44,773
correlation with
all the killings?

413
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:51,469
Who are you?

414
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:54,921
Abby: you know I've thought
about it a lot and

415
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:56,750
the only thing I can
think of that kind of

416
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:59,891
connects us all is...

417
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:01,617
Man: What are you doing?!

418
00:54:01,652 --> 00:54:04,206
like we were all

419
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,520
kind of in some
form of the movie business.

420
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:10,868
like I'm a
background artist

421
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:15,148
I think Emily was actually
an actress like

422
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:17,219
I think she did some
local local theatre

423
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,256
and like local stuff
like that and then

424
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,880
obviously Walter and
his documentaries

425
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:29,645
that he makes and
Dave he worked on

426
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,029
movies and I think
I don't know but I

427
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:37,619
think Cynthia might
have modeled it was

428
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,138
kind of the same thing
I mean it's kind

429
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,037
of a waste of a pretty
face if she didn't model.

430
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,003
WHO ARE YOU?!

431
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:45,282
Somebody help me!

432
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,525
Help me!

433
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:54,152
Abby: but yeah that was
the connection that I
came up with.

434
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,398
and that seems to make a lot
of sense.

435
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:12,964
Reporter: so tell me what your
recovery was like

436
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:14,690
in the hospital.

437
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:16,036
Abby: Oh god.

438
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:20,144
I was there for about
three weeks

439
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:23,147
they had to do two
surgeries

440
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:26,599
because the one arrow
the one arrow was

441
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:31,086
so close to my spine
so they had it....

442
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,122
that was kind of tricky
for them to get it out

443
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:35,711
without causing a
lot of nerve damage

444
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:38,265
the other one
was just kind of

445
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,268
more in the flesh so
that wasn't as bad

446
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,687
People always ask me if
they can see the scars

447
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:47,205
Absolutely.

448
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,000
let's go ahead and get a
close-up on this.

449
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:53,384
Reporter: Wow.
they're pretty big

450
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:57,250
Those look like some good
war wounds.

451
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:59,114
Yeah I mean
they're supposed to

452
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,703
fade but I kind of
scar bad.

453
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,463
Why are they so big?

454
00:56:03,498 --> 00:56:06,293
um so the guy used like

455
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:09,124
razor arrows so they're
kind of they're

456
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:12,230
shaped like that
so when they go in

457
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:15,199
actually make that
same shape and then

458
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:18,892
to get them out they
had to cut further

459
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:24,001
around him mm-hmm so
I just yeah I mean

460
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:27,453
I'll have him forever
but at least it's on

461
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,420
my back so...

462
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:33,424
[choking]

463
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:36,876
Reporter: you're really lucky
that you made out.

464
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,636
Abby: Yeah.

465
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:41,087
I don't know, but I just think

466
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:43,020
just think there was
a reason you know

467
00:56:43,054 --> 00:56:45,332
did the police offer
you any protection

468
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:48,957
yeah while I was in
the hospital they did.

469
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:51,891
because they
thought this was done

470
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:54,203
by the serial killer
they thought was

471
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:57,621
out there. they had
security at the door

472
00:56:57,655 --> 00:57:00,796
like 24 hours a day
but as soon as I was

473
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:04,006
released kind of was
my responsibility

474
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:08,735
if I wanted further
protection so I mean

475
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,048
the first night they
did actually patrol

476
00:57:11,082 --> 00:57:14,534
outside my house but
after that if I

477
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:18,331
wanted it, I had to
hire somebody so um

478
00:57:18,365 --> 00:57:19,850
Reporter: that's tough

479
00:57:19,884 --> 00:57:22,853
yeah and it's
expensive and kind of

480
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,717
invasive of your privacy so

481
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:30,550
I figure well between
Murphy and my gun

482
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:34,416
and other ways I can
protect myself like

483
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,383
I should be fine.

484
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:40,077
[choking]

485
00:57:47,187 --> 00:57:51,847
Reporter: so this is going to
be on TV. a lot of
people are gonna be

486
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:54,263
watching this and
possibly the killer.

487
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:56,956
do you have a message for
the killer?

488
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:59,752
yeah

489
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:08,761
I.dare you to come after
me again. I dare you.

490
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:14,076
I'm ready and it's
not gonna end pretty
for you.

491
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:17,701
Reporter: wow that
sounds like quite a threat.

492
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:18,909
yeah

493
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:23,879
it's meant to be.
I survived for a reason.

494
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,801
Reporter: well I want to thank
you so much for

495
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:51,597
taking the time for
us to go ahead and

496
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:54,116
interview you and Ik
let you know when it
will be airing.

497
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:56,256
awesome. thank you so much.

498
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,775
Reporter: yeah thank you

499
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:01,020
yeah thanks especially
for telling your story.

500
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,781
I realize it
can be kind of hard

501
00:59:04,506 --> 00:59:07,129
we'llll go ahead
and wrap up here

502
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:08,993
and then get out of
your hair

503
00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:09,960
Okay

504
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,793
Wanna want to know the
stupidest thing about this?

505
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:18,037
how many people
have said,

506
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:22,213
[mocking] "oh you get a new
lease on life. make it count!"

507
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:26,217
"Oh Abby, what are you
gonna do with your
new lease on life?"

508
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:28,495
God.. no shit.

509
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,187
obviously I'm gonna
make it count

510
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:32,810
there's a reason I'm
the only one that survived.

511
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:34,122
who uses a
bow and arrow to

512
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:37,366
hunt somebody anyway?
what am i? a fucking deer?

513
00:59:38,402 --> 00:59:40,024
What kind of a
dipshit thinks he

514
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,612
can get away with
killing this many people?

515
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:51,553
Reporter: Stupid piece of
German crap!

516
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,698
Reporter: [laughs]
Uh... no.

517
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:18,615
piece of shit

518
01:00:34,216 --> 01:00:38,565
Who's a dipshit now?

519
01:00:56,998 --> 01:01:00,484
hello everyone. thanks
for watching my movie.

520
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:03,038
I'll have you
know that this movie

521
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:08,768
is mine. I produced it.
I shot it. I edited it.

522
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:11,529
and I wrote the
soundtrack for it

523
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:13,773
and you may be thinking...
a found footage film

524
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:16,396
with a soundtrack?
yeah it has music

525
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:21,367
the reason why? music
makes a movie more intense.

526
01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:23,680
I guess you
could call it a

527
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:27,787
found footage film.
but really it isn't.

528
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:29,513
I shot it.

529
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:32,412
and I'm delivering it.
I guess you

530
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:36,209
could consider it found
when you find it online.

531
01:01:38,246 --> 01:01:43,596
[Music]

532
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:57,023
everything you watched
is real. you can

533
01:01:57,058 --> 01:01:59,060
check the news stories
on the people you

534
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,096
saw in this movie.
the news stories will

535
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,720
match up with the
names and the images

536
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:06,205
you saw in this
film. now that I'm

537
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,552
finished shooting
I'll finish the Edit

538
01:02:08,586 --> 01:02:10,865
and then I'll post
it on YouTube, Vimeo

539
01:02:10,899 --> 01:02:13,695
and a few other
places. so you can

540
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,422
download it. I'll just
give the heads up

541
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:18,700
if you're one of the
few people watching this,

542
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,357
you're gonna
want to download it right now.

543
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:22,669
honestly,
after a certain point

544
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:25,120
you're not gonna
be able to find it

545
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,538
feel free to torrent
it, share it free

546
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:31,092
online on all the
other streaming

547
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,163
services and servers
because once the

548
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:35,061
public realizes what's
contained in it

549
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:37,719
it'll be taken down
immediately

550
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:41,136
it'll likely be co-opted
by the authorities

551
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,414
for evidence or
whatever else

[Indistinct talking on phone]

Lady: No, no. I'm in
for the night.

554
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:06,955
I'm having a little Chardonnay
and I'm out.

555
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:15,722
Just get him to sign that doc.

556
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:18,415
Yeah. And then we're done.

557
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:20,382
All right. See you later.

558
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:27,044
Reporter: Just couple of
technical things you should

559
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:31,186
note... I have titled
the movie 4K Killer

560
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,637
Now, the authorities
called me the

561
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:36,502
South Valley killer
I hate it when

562
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:39,367
authorities and news
stations give you a

563
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:41,645
title that you didn't
ask for and you

564
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,820
didn't want and they
have no idea of

565
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,339
your motive. I am NOT
the South Valley Killer

566
01:03:46,374 --> 01:03:49,377
I was very deliberate
in what I did

567
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:53,070
wanted to record all
the killings and I

568
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:55,659
I wanted it to be a
really high-quality footage.

569
01:03:55,693 --> 01:03:58,351
so I shot
everything in 4k

570
01:04:10,432 --> 01:04:12,849
now that the footage
is being released

571
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,678
and the feature film
is available, I want

572
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:17,370
you to call me 4K Killer

573
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:23,756
Why 4K killer? well it's high
quality footage.

574
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,967
I shot it in 4k.
in layman's terms, 4k means

575
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:31,660
really high resolution.
I wanted the

576
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:33,731
picture to look good
for you guys

577
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:37,287
so that means all cameras,
cellphones, drones,

578
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:42,533
GoPros, everything I
used was shot in 4k

579
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:45,433
I mean you gotta have
high quality when

580
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:48,056
you have a feature
film and plus the killings...

581
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:50,714
you want to
get into that nitty

582
01:04:50,748 --> 01:04:52,958
gritty detail. that way this

583
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:57,376
entertainment is
of utmost highest quality

584
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,723
I only want
to do the best so

585
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:02,899
that's what I gave you

4K Killer: a bit of a
disclaimer. Some of the

589
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:43,180
cameras I used don't
actually shoot in
full 4K.

590
01:05:43,215 --> 01:05:44,147
Lady: [coughs]

591
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:48,875
They were UHD
formats or Ultra High Definition

592
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:49,842
Lady: [breathes heavily]

593
01:05:53,397 --> 01:05:56,780
a lot of people
mistakenly call it 4k and it's

594
01:05:56,814 --> 01:05:59,921
technically not you
know there's about a
hundred pixels
difference

595
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,373
what we're used to seeing is
called HD or high definition

596
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:06,341
that means
the resolution or

597
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:09,689
actual amount of pixels is 1920

598
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:13,693
horizontal pixels
by 1080 vertical pixels.

599
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:16,662
UHD has
literally double that
resolution.

600
01:06:16,696 --> 01:06:22,254
so 3840 horizontal pixels by
2160 vertical pixels

601
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:25,740
so the horizontal pixels are
actually 160 pixels short of

602
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:29,778
4k or 4000 pixels
But you know...

603
01:06:29,813 --> 01:06:33,644
It's really close enough,
so people just say 4K.

604
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,027
and besides UHD
killer... that really

605
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:40,686
doesn't have the
same mm as 4K Killer

606
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,860
I don't know.
maybe they're both

607
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:45,725
stupid names but I'm
not letting the

608
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,728
media or other people
decide my name.

609
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:51,593
I decide that.

614
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:13,546
most of my GoPros
are GoPro 4's but

615
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:15,307
there was one scene
that I just wanted

616
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:17,447
that other angle and
aso I only had one

617
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,794
more GoPro 2 so
technically that's

618
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,935
only an HD and not UHD
I had to up-res it.

619
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:25,351
so I mean don't get
your panties in a wad

620
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:27,457
over it. I mean
it's not that big of a deal.

621
01:07:29,217 --> 01:07:31,564
Lady: [gags]

622
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:35,465
so I'll be
officially releasing

623
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:38,985
my movie in u HD or
4k. so when you're

624
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,849
googling my movie to download it

625
01:07:40,884 --> 01:07:43,921
definitely do not
download the HD version.

626
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:48,133
and seriously
do not settle for SD

627
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:52,309
I mean people
are gonna try to

628
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,863
compress it and I
mean it's just not

629
01:07:54,898 --> 01:07:56,900
worth it especially
when you have the

630
01:07:56,934 --> 01:08:00,145
UHD version available
and it's free okay

631
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:02,975
enough about that.
let's move on to the killings.

634
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:28,345
make sure my hair
looks good. all right

635
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,141
okay. slate. eight

636
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:34,800
okay sorry I had to

637
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:37,389
head out. I mean my
phone dinged. I had

638
01:08:37,423 --> 01:08:39,253
to get the camera
equipment back because

639
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,944
otherwise they charged
me for an extra day

640
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:42,290
and I mean
seriously this has

641
01:08:42,325 --> 01:08:43,705
already cost me an
arm and a leg.

642
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:45,051
heh... arm and a leg

643
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:46,708
yeah I'm funny

644
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:50,436
no but seriously... camera
equipment is not cheap.

645
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,203
[Music]

646
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:05,520
okay anyway I wanted to show you

647
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:08,351
everything that I've
done so this is the mask.

648
01:09:08,385 --> 01:09:12,009
I know it's kind of crude,
but you kind of get

649
01:09:12,044 --> 01:09:14,909
kind of get the feel
of it. so initially

650
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:17,256
what I had done. I got
some burlap sack

651
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:19,189
and I put it under
so you couldn't

652
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:21,536
distinguish my eyes.
but dang that stuff hurts.

653
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,159
I mean it started
unraveling

654
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,850
it wasn't working and
then I got in my eyes

655
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:26,300
and started itching
my eyes then my eyes

656
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:28,336
got red and I don't need those
problems.

657
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:30,890
so I switched to this

658
01:09:30,925 --> 01:09:34,963
handy-dandy pantyhose
and I mean it's

659
01:09:34,998 --> 01:09:37,587
amazing you just
easily put it on and

660
01:09:37,621 --> 01:09:40,900
then put it in the
mask and no one can

661
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:42,385
identify you

662
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:44,835
no one saw these
baby blues

663
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,874
but another part of my costume
was this bad boy

664
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:51,566
you see this? that's
my stomach

665
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:53,741
you may think, oh you could
look pregnant

666
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,745
no, It just made me look
fat so I wore the

667
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:01,990
stomach plus the
mask, so no one could

668
01:10:02,025 --> 01:10:04,855
identify me at all.
so yeah I never

669
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:07,479
intentionally made
the connection with

670
01:10:07,513 --> 01:10:10,033
all those that I
killed. they were

671
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:12,380
somehow apparently
linked to the film

672
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:15,763
industry. I didn't
know I didn't realize that.

673
01:10:15,797 --> 01:10:17,868
but good on you,
Abigail for doing that.

674
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:20,940
Hey. Have you ever heard of
soft-sticks, asshole?

675
01:10:21,286 --> 01:10:23,874
It just basically
comes down to--

676
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:26,014
they were in close proximity
to each other

677
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:29,432
you know a lot of
people... they operate
in patterns.

678
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:34,195
routines. so
I'd watch and I'd
observe.

679
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,715
and I'd see
if they fit my profile.

680
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:39,200
Abigail's detective work?

681
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,445
She obviously put some
heavy analysis and

682
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,999
thinking into this.
her conclusion was a

683
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,553
bit of a stretch
because they all

684
01:10:47,588 --> 01:10:49,728
weren't involved in
the film industry

685
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:52,420
I mean apparently some
were but when you

686
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:54,629
start putting enough
time and energy

687
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:57,805
into figuring out
your killer or your

688
01:10:57,839 --> 01:11:00,152
attempted killer, then
it kind of makes

689
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,050
sense how she came up with those
conclusions.

690
01:11:02,085 --> 01:11:03,880
I suppose
you have to start

691
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:06,814
finding answers so
you don't go insane

692
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:09,057
but honestly the main thing that

693
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:11,301
connected them all...
they all lived within

694
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:13,717
100 miles of each
other. it was just a

695
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:15,719
fact of mere convenience
for me.

696
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:19,240
that's it. nothing more.
I selected them based

697
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,208
upon how often they were alone

698
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:27,766
I watched them. I
observed them.

699
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,009
I checked out out
their routines.

700
01:11:30,044 --> 01:11:32,909
I couldn't have others
close by when I

701
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:34,600
was gonna kill them.
there are several

702
01:11:34,635 --> 01:11:36,637
people that I watched
and then they just

703
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:38,639
really didn't fit my
profile. that's it.

704
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:41,158
plain and simple. one
thing I did find

705
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:43,299
funny is that a lot
of people gave me

706
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:46,198
motives that honestly
I just didn't have

707
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:48,718
they thought I was out
to get someone or

708
01:11:48,752 --> 01:11:52,411
I had revenge or that
it was something

709
01:11:52,446 --> 01:11:55,138
from when I was a
kid that I'm pissed off about.

710
01:11:55,276 --> 01:11:58,037
what's my motive?

711
01:11:58,072 --> 01:11:59,625
I wanted to make a movie.

712
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,557
and I did.

713
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:04,423
I made this entire movie.

714
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:08,462
I guess
I should give some

715
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:11,982
credit to those who
died. I did a

716
01:12:12,017 --> 01:12:17,125
shit-ton of work so give
credit where credit is due

717
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:21,198
I tried to
be creative in my

718
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:23,856
killings and with
my weapons. it was

719
01:12:23,891 --> 01:12:26,445
tough getting an SMG
and flying under

720
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,173
the radar. I figured
after Abigail got away,

721
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,003
that wasn't gonna
happen a second time

722
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:37,283
it just pissed
me off that it
didn't work.

723
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,871
Borja.

724
01:12:39,562 --> 01:12:42,599
if you're watching this,
watch your back.

725
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:44,360
Cause I'm coming for you.

726
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:50,538
you sold me an
automatic that cost a

727
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:53,265
shit ton of money and
didn't even work

728
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:54,231
Fuck you!

729
01:12:58,477 --> 01:13:01,480
Anyway... I release my movie
out to the world.

730
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:04,690
I hope you find it shocking
and entertaining.

731
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:07,037
and as good as a
movie should be.

732
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:11,697
I realized that my
face is going to be
out there.

733
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:16,668
but I can guarantee you will
never find me.

734
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,258
This project took a lot
of patience on my part.

735
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:23,985
to bring everything
together.

736
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,988
It's been a lot of work

737
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,649
but it's my
contribution to the
art world

738
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:36,895
Thank you.

740
