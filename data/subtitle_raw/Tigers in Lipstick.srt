1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,510
Tigers in lipstick

2
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,190
THE ARAB

3
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,340
Hey, who are you trying to fool...?
You're not an Arab.

4
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,660
What a piece...

5
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,940
Hey, come here.

6
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,670
Stop it baby...

7
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,420
There you are.
eight

8
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,750
Climb the stairs.

9
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,830
- With all the merchandise?
- Don't be ridiculous, leave everything there.

10
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,340
I'm here, on your right.

11
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,990
Do you have matches?

12
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,870
No.

13
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,700
You know, it's horrible.

14
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,700
As soon as I wake up
I immediately want to smoke.

15
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,390
Well, how do you put up with all those
clothes, dear.

16
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,740
I see a man in a dress
and I get even hotter.

17
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,540
Then get undressed... Like this...
Good boy... get undressed...

18
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,100
And don't you dare go up to bed
bed dressed like that.

19
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,380
Better yes, but...

20
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,670
I'm sure it would be much
cooler...

21
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,620
But don't say that, in spite of
everything, you feel excited.

22
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,580
- Excitement, yes... yes.
- Ah, I don't believe it.

23
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:12,060
How can you wear such things
at this hour... in this heat?

24
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,660
Isn't it too much...?
Where are you from? Morocco?

25
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,900
No, from Sicily.

26
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,190
Please, over there.

27
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,910
Yes, yes, that's exactly what the...
what the doctor... prescribed.

28
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

29
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,700
Yeah. Be smart...
Well, come on, put me down, come on.
thirty

30
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,100
- Yes, right now, just don't move.
- How nice...

31
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,980
Oh yes...
Oh yes, just wonderful.

32
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,420
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, just don't stop.

33
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,870
Yes, yes, sorry...
I wanted to ask you about that photo.

34
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,990
How did you manage to put it down there
down there on the beach?

35
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,070
- The boy did it.
- What boy?

36
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,580
Yes, the one who sells liquor on the beach.

37
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,580
I asked him to leave the photo
somewhere in plain sight...

38
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,660
... was looking for a partner.

39
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,100
- Like a hook, right?
- Exactly.

40
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,020
- And they caught me like a fish.
- I hate those comparisons.

41
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,860
I didn't mean to offend you.

42
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,500
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- I wouldn't say that...

43
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,670
I hope you don't regret...
Damn heat.

44
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,220
No, no, if after this
something else will follow.

45
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,780
- So, do you want to continue?
- Yes, I do.

46
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,140
Don't stop, fan...

47
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,590
Well, let's see if I can make you happy....

48
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,540
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes...
Harder, harder...

49
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,550
Don't stop...
Don't stop...

50
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,020
Oh yes, oh yes...
Louder.

51
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,750
You are a beauty...
Did I do something wrong?

52
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,380
- You are overflowing with joy.
- And what else do I have left?

53
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,180
A knife could help...

54
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,670
A knife to open envelopes?

55
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,870
Yes, that's not a bad idea...
Put it on my forehead.

56
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,580
- Like this?
- Oh, yes... And here...

57
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,260
Oh yes...

58
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,900
And here too... I am very sorry that
this knife is not bigger.

59
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,630
- You are absolutely right.
- Please appal me again.

60
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes, yes... now.

61
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,020
Oh yes.

62
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,630
Is it okay...?
Please don't be afraid if I...

63
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,430
But listen, in this heat
I'm not capable of anything.

64
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,700
Don't worry.

65
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,660
No, don't do it like that, you'll ruin all the fun.
all the fun.

66
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,220
No, I'm not going to mess it up...
Come on, think about the envelope opener...

67
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,220
After all, it's what you wanted....

68
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:14,740
Just think how... this
nice breeze... refreshes you.

69
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,100
Are there no paintings in this house
depicting a winter landscape?

70
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,220
None...?
Christmas... North Pole... Ice.

71
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,700
How can they make love in that cold.

72
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,990
Imagine his hands, they are completely
freezing cold... And yet... her feet are cold...

73
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,660
And it's 50 degrees below zero outside...
And they... bury themselves in the snow...

74
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,780
Howling wolves... Frozen in
cold places... really cold.

75
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,270
It's unconvincing... You're all sweaty...
Now look, it's 40 degrees...

76
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,500
And stop telling me all those lies.

77
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,270
We almost made it.

78
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,030
Well, okay... just because
you seem like a nice person, I'll try.

79
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,620
A cold shower might help...

80
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,350
And then we'll see if I can make
you happy with me.

81
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,150
Great idea.
Thank you, you are very kind.

82
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,470
Thank you, because any
idiot could come...

83
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,460
You always take a risk,
leaving a photo on the beach.

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,460
Yeah, I didn't even think about it...
Even the crabs could come.

85
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,380
- How old are you?
Well, let's say thirty.

86
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,030
Yes, it's a good age...

87
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,860
Listen dear while I'm taking a shower...
I'm taking a shower...

88
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,420
...don't just stand there...

89
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,630
Look at this mess...
I get even hotter.

90
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,900
Yes, and please remove the pillows
so we have more room.

91
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,500
Who is it?

92
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,060
- Madam.
- Yes, what is it?

93
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,630
- There is a man sleeping in his room.
- It's impossible, look again.

94
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,430
- But I saw it.
- Look again.

95
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,620
All right then.

96
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,980
Mr....

97
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,740
Hey, uh... Mister...

98
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,110
Come on, wake up...

99
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,300
Let's go...

100
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,780
Oh shit, he's dead...
Ma'am, there's a dead man in your room.

101
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,260
But ma'am...

102
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,340
Don't touch me you monster...
I didn't do anything to him.

103
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,710
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.

104
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,230
No... I found a photo on the
beach... I'm not to blame for anything.

105
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,670
Of course he is not to blame.
You can tell everything in the section.

106
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,190
Just terrible...
I called them on the phone...

107
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,740
I sit in the street, and I see a suspicious
a suspicious Arab into the house...

108
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,100
Did he also kill the lady?

109
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,420
No, the lady, she just
lost consciousness.

110
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,470
Maybe it will be better if I take her downstairs
to get some fresh air...

111
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,220
...away from the body of
her unfortunate husband.

112
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,340
What is going to happen to him?

113
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,660
He will get 10 years.
He's not facing the death penalty....

114
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,100
For him, this is an opportunity
to get an education...

115
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,100
I knew one, before he went to prison he couldn't read or write...
prison he couldn't even read or write....

116
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,340
He is now a teacher...

117
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,870
Well, what did you see in this woman...?
Nothing, 10 years for that...

118
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,070
It would have been better if
stayed at home.

119
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,100
For a woman like that, I would agree
to do it again, even 20 years more.

120
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,740
Yes, he says, only because his
10 years are over.

121
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,140
You wanderers are jealous of me.
jealous of me.

122
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,340
In this prison no one dares
to dream of such a girl.

123
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,580
- All women are whores.
- Relax.

124
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,100
Since I've been locked up,
my head has been spinning.

125
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,780
I want to get out of here and I will get out....
That's just what the doctor ordered.

126
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,460
- I'll choose who I'm with...
- Stop doing that...

127
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,620
Soon at your service will be all
the whores of the city, if you want it.

128
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,940
I didn't understand anything,
others do not interest me.

129
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,060
I will not rest until I have her in my arms.

130
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,540
Gigio is a true friend,
he managed to find the lady's address...

131
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,270
Really great...
I got your phone number...

132
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,100
Once I get out of this hole...
Watch out bitch...

133
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,260
Why should you be careful?
Is he going to kill her?

134
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,870
Excuse me, does Mrs. Martucci
live here?

135
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,340
- Are you Fieroni?
- Yes, I am.

136
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,100
But how do you know?

137
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,950
The lady has been waiting for you
for quite some time.

138
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,420
- Which floor?
- 5th floor, apartment 12.

139
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,550
Second door to the right of the elevator.

140
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,260
May I come in?

141
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes, come in, dear.

142
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,700
- Where are you?
- I'm upstairs.

143
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,190
Finally.

144
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,220
What's stopping you?
Come on in, honey...

145
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,060
I have been waiting for you for ten years.

146
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,140
- How long did it take you to get here?
- Don't you know, I was locked up for murder.

147
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,820
- Are you very angry?
- Angry? Honestly, yes.

148
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,060
Oh, my God.

149
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,260
Why do you always have so many
clothes in this heat.

150
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,420
Just look at you and immediately
it's hot.

151
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,060
Yes? And I've been roasting
for 10 years, ma'am.

152
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,260
Are you going to take revenge on me?
Maybe you're going to kill me?

153
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,500
Come on, you have the right.

154
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,260
But on the other hand, my dear, what difference does it make.

155
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,260
Do you want to rape me...?
To defeat me?

156
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,820
Maybe I'm wrong, but
you should pay my bill.

157
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,630
What a dramatic statement.

158
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,750
Now I am constantly crazy...

159
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,900
...when I remember how you treated me...

160
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,580
Which is true... But I am
completely exhausted in this heat...

161
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,550
- I am dead.
- Don't talk about death.

162
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,110
Yes, I'm sorry, honey...
But there are no dead people at home today.

163
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,940
Do you see it?

164
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:09,070
Whether it was released in Oct,
winter... or spring...

165
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,540
...yes, in any month more suitable.

166
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,180
There is always a reason,
it's cold, even in August.

167
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:21,430
All right then... Get undressed.
We have to do something in this heat...

168
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,700
Then get naked...
I like you better naked.

169
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,020
Of course, of course.

170
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,870
But this time, we will address
what went wrong last time.

171
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,670
- I will do everything that depends on me.
- No tricks, okay?

172
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,110
Like this... and like this...
This is where you will stay.

173
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,550
This piece of iron is so cold.

174
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,860
But she'll help you freshen up.
Honey, I'll be ready now.

175
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,060
Oh, come, undress...
Oh, I'm your slave, I'm your prisoner.

176
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,100
- I'm coming.
- Hit me hard... Love me.

177
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,430
Now... I'm coming...
Great... Relax...

178
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,470
Leave everything to me honey and you'll see....

179
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,910
I've been waiting for this for 10 years...
I went crazy dreaming about you...

180
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,830
Enough talk, let's make love.

181
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,780
What did you say?

182
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,620
I always speak Dutch
when I make love.

183
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,300
I am thirsty.

184
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,580
If you are thirsty, stop,
if you're hungry, dig in.

185
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,070
What?

186
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,110
An old Chinese proverb.

187
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,460
If you are thirsty, then loving
is not good for you...

188
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,940
...but if you're hungry...

189
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm thirsty but I won't stop for anything.

190
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,150
I have left in the fridge,
some champagne.

191
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,220
- French champagne? May I?
- You must...

192
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,470
You know... You were right:
the game was worth it.

193
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,540
In what way?

194
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,100
After such an act of love,
he could go back to jail...

195
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,860
...for another 10 years.

196
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,940
Thanks for the compliment...
But isn't this a joke?

197
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,660
No, I was only speaking figuratively.

198
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,500
Hurry up dear, I'm starting
to get excited again.

199
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,060
Wait.

200
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,110
So that I fall in love again...?.
I'm not going to defend myself...

201
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,750
The body is in the fridge...
Take me away guys.

202
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,100
He killed him and then raped me....

203
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,860
Poor Aran died protecting me.

204
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,660
It is terrible, terrible.

205
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,150
Bitch...
Looks like you had a lot of fun.

206
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,870
Shut up you idiot or do you also want to
to relax in jail in his company?

207
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,830
Let's go.

208
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,140
I touched the gun...

209
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,590
My fingerprints are everywhere.
everywhere. Even on the fridge...

210
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,830
It seems useless to deny it.

211
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,980
Dirty bastard... I saw it coming...

212
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,110
He acted a little strange...
That's why I called the police...

213
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,980
Poor lady, how much has fallen on her.

214
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,900
- Well, this is too much.
- What does it mean?

215
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,460
I swear, no one in the world,
no idiot would agree...

216
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,300
...to wait in jail
for sleeping with a woman.

217
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,980
The guy looks like he's gone crazy.

218
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,660
Well, unless I go crazy
in 10 years, I'll come back to you...

219
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,820
...my lovely whore.

220
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,390
MOTHER OF MY MOTHER

221
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,150
- Hello ma'am... I'm late for school.
- Why are you late?

222
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,660
I had to take my brother to day care,
my mother is sick again.

223
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,980
- Oh, you poor thing.
- I'm late for the first time in my life.

224
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,270
So the teachers don't scold me,
someone has to come in with me.

225
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,780
Could I do it?

226
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,020
- Me?... To school?.
- Yes. Why not?

227
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,140
No... Get out of here...
No, I'm not properly dressed...

228
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,590
And no one will believe that I am your mother.

229
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,180
My teacher says I am the
first student in the class.

230
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,860
- The first student?
- Yes.

231
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,420
But I don't even look like
your aunt, or your father.

232
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,420
No. I want you to say
you're my mom, not my dad.

233
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,900
If you were my dad...
Would you beat me up?

234
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,940
- A beating?
Yes, but I don't know how...

235
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,420
...I never knew how to lie.

236
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,070
My lies are like Pinocchio's lies
I always come out...

237
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,110
...that's my Achilles heel.
I start to move...

238
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,110
Look, let's forget it...
I won't be able to do anything.

239
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,580
- No, he'll do fine, I know it...
- Why do you want to fool me?

240
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,390
You are a great actress, even
better than Wooster's mother...

241
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,980
Well, please, or I'll get scolded later.

242
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,270
All right, I hope my ass
doesn't let you down... Where are we going?

243
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,100
- There.
- Let's go.

244
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,590
Hey, come on.

245
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,980
And I'd better button up my coat,
otherwise you'll really be scolded...

246
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,700
That's... Well...?
Let's go.

247
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,500
Do not scold the child. Keep in mind
that this is his first tardy.

248
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,700
- First, he says.
- He is the best student.

249
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,670
- Stop it... Is he the best?
Yes, he told me so himself.

250
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,950
Little scoundrel... This semester
your child has only come to school twice.

251
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,910
Two?

252
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,460
Exactly... I'm even surprised
that he came today.

253
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,190
We would prefer never to see him again.

254
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,580
He's joking, at least
exaggerating... Poor guy.

255
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,260
- You should have read my letter.
- Letter?

256
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,700
Yes... The boy was seriously
sick, he had the flu.

257
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,710
Right?

258
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,590
Look how pale he is.

259
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,670
He lost so much weight that...
I didn't even recognize him this morning.

260
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,750
Well, isn't that sad.
The mother does not recognize her son.

261
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,790
And yet, every morning, she has to take her brother to daycare...
to take her brother to kindergarten...

262
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,910
...because children must also
be more independent.

263
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,620
You know, your family... No, our
family... It's not easy for us.

264
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,460
We have to walk many
streets in the rain and cold.

265
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,100
It must be very exhausting, but
having a husband like yours...

266
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,980
...the world-famous Giorgio
Salveri, I can understand that...

267
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,860
- Did you hear?...Giorgio Salveri?.
- Do you remember him?... Your husband.

268
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,140
A madman climbing the Eiffel Tower.

269
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,740
Oh, of course.

270
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,860
I appreciate his tact, for the fact
that it does not take advantage...

271
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,460
...your family's position.

272
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,460
But I have to tell you that this...
Silly, to put it mildly...

273
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,670
...is far behind in the classroom.

274
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,660
Really?

275
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,830
For the past 2 years, your child has
been sitting in fourth grade or...

276
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,300
...or sits for 4 years
in second grade.

277
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,590
Just don't tell me, last year he's been in first grade for 5 years.
been in first grade for 5 years.

278
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,190
No, wait... Unbelievable...
Maybe you're confusing him with someone else?.

279
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,340
If he is incompetent, why was he named valedictorian?
named valedictorian?

280
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,140
- The best student?
- Of course.

281
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,140
So he told me.

282
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,220
- Are you talking about "our misfortune"?
- About him...

283
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,580
Yes, I named him valedictorian
of the class...

284
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,820
...because the boy deserves it.

285
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,820
Right?

286
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,550
It burned our theater, flooded the showers.

287
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,860
When toilets clog, it's your fault...
toilets, it's your fault...

288
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,790
He blew up the lab, broke the kitchen wall and interrupted
the kitchen and interrupted Mother's Day.

289
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,220
Did you hear what the teacher said?
- Director, if you don't mind.

290
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,900
He heard nothing about it.

291
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,700
The last exam required
to write 82 lines...

292
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,510
...and he only wrote 32 or 33 lines,
I don't remember...

293
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,340
...and there is not a single word
without error, not a single one.

294
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,550
Your mommy is exhausted...
trying to teach you.

295
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,910
You understand that I don't want
to be too strict...

296
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,100
...but put yourself in my place
and judge for yourself...

297
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,830
Yes...
How to evaluate it.

298
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,180
More or less like this...

299
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,260
- Four... Just something like that?
- That's a lot...

300
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,580
- Well, yes, six... Six?
- No way...

301
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,550
- Maybe five?
- Four.

302
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,740
- Little boy, what is your name?
- Filippo.

303
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,420
You're not lying...?
Come here for a moment.

304
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,060
Here's this for you little guy.
I'm going to kick your ass.

305
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,190
- I'm sorry... Yes, Director?

306
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,140
But doesn't your husband care?

307
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,540
No absolutely not...
How are you doing with history?

308
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,220
I really want to know.

309
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,540
- History...
- History.

310
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,740
- Story.
- Shut up.

311
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,300
I don't know... there is nothing in "history".

312
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,900
Don't tell me "I don't know..."
Be more specific.

313
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,500
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this?
- No.

314
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,630
He has always been, how shall I put it
to put it mildly, completely incapable.

315
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,300
- Totally incapable?
- Yes, minus another 3 points.

316
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,300
Three? You're useless...
What about arithmetic?

317
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,670
I told him that the boy is a
complete layman in arithmetic.

318
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,020
He... Let's not talk about it, okay.

319
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,460
No, it is your responsibility
to give knowledge.

320
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,950
I want to know absolutely everything.

321
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,340
No, it's actually not that bad.

322
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,500
His grades in arithmetic have always
have always been quite high.

323
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,700
What does it mean?

324
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,660
I dreamt that my son became
an excellent student...

325
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,620
And now I suddenly know, that
this guy is a complete idiot...

326
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,830
But why then did he name him
the best student in the class?

327
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,380
So, he is not the best student?

328
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,620
And I make sacrifices so that he gets
the best education, and he's dumb?

329
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,390
Well, I shouldn't say that.

330
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,620
A better word would fit here...
"Failed."

331
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,070
No, he's an imbecile, if he doesn't know how to
how to write correctly... And in history?

332
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,870
Only God knows what their qualifications are.

333
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,750
No, it is well developed
for a three-year-old.

334
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,740
What?

335
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,700
Let the baby try, look
you can count on... Don't mess it up.

336
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,940
- Let's go.
- 6 times 11?

337
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,020
Six times eleven?

338
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,020
I see everything, don't tell him...
The child must count.

339
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,660
Answer...
6 times 11...?

340
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,220
Don't you know... Then...?.
Poor fool... fool.

341
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,750
- Fuck you.
- So you talk to your mom like that.

342
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,900
Yes, like this.

343
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,550
Did you hear what he said to his
mom...? This is my son.

344
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,510
No mother in the world can stand it.

345
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,310
Take it easy. Please.

346
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,620
We should treat the boy better.
Your husband is a good man.

347
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,060
We will give the boy a history test.

348
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,380
Yes, he's crazy...
Do you think you'll calm me down with this deception?

349
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,590
Son, you're breaking Mom's heart.

350
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,790
She is not my mother...
I am telling the truth.

351
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,580
What are you doing...?
Is this the education you give him?

352
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,740
This semester he has never
come to school.

353
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,100
I'm your mother, right?

354
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't know her...
My dad will put her in jail.

355
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,540
Wait a minute... What's the
the story?

356
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,580
She gave me candy and told me
to come with her.

357
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,710
- Did I do that?
- This is too much... Who is it?

358
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,510
- I am his mother and he is my son.
- She sells herself.

359
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,300
For sale? So your mother is a whore?
How dare you.

360
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,660
Show me your passport...
I want to make sure it's your mother.

361
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,310
- Yours first.
- Mine...?

362
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,380
- And hurry up... Show me your passport.
- Are you kidding me?

363
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,460
I am serious,
I will expose it.

364
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,350
Turned the boy against his mother.
his mother... I will withdraw him from school.

365
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,500
Come on, Filippo.

366
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,470
No. You can't go.
I have to look at your ID.

367
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,510
Suddenly he is kidnapping
a child.

368
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,660
Take your hands off me, you depraved animal.

369
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,860
He mistreats my boy and now
is insulting his mother.

370
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,670
- Let's get out of here, I'll take care of you.
- Wait.

371
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,260
And now you will obey...

372
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,500
Bibelo, bring back that mother and
mother and child.

373
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,510
We will start a new life.

374
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,550
You will not pass me by, ma'am.

375
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,460
Yes, I've passed, you idiot.

376
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,510
THE WIDOW

377
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,660
Yes?

378
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm sorry, I'm ashamed to
bothering you, but, in the cemetery...

379
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,340
...I didn't dare to approach...
In that environment, it would be impolite.

380
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,950
Oh no, I've had enough... No
seem to be embarrassed at all.

381
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,340
- But listen...
- Leave me alone.

382
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,390
But his spouse never refused.
to journalists.

383
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,940
For the past 10 years he has been
voluntarily talking to us...

384
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,260
But I am not a public figure. I have
nothing to say to the nation, I am nobody.

385
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,700
I disagree, ma'am...
I know you've had a hard day.

386
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,740
But it's not just their pain.

387
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,220
The death of her husband is a great loss
for everyone, even for his enemies.

388
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,150
Everyone respected him...
Everyone is suffering.

389
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,750
Okay, between...

390
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,750
Well... Hurry up.

391
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,420
In a hurry... Yes.

392
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,990
Well, I'll tell you...

393
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,380
Could you wear black again?
With veil and hat, but only for....

394
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,350
For what?

395
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,900
I want to take pictures... You must
dress the same as in the cemetery.

396
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,900
But I have been photographed at the
funeral... Why more pictures?

397
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,230
There are so many people around in these
pictures that you can't see their face.

398
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,220
What?

399
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,100
You can't see it... All the time
something was covering her... Do you understand?

400
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,830
So you have to do it all over again.
Yes, I'm afraid I have to.

401
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,980
It's like this...
Let me hold it...

402
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,740
It's perfect, perfect...
Beautiful.

403
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:45,140
- Well... I'm ready.
- Turn around a little.

404
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,470
Fabulous...
I'm afraid it won't work.

405
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,780
- Why?
- We need a window in the background.

406
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,540
For what?

407
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:03,710
The sky in the background... And from here you can see
only a building... I need a background.

408
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,910
This must be in harmony with the view.
We need a piece of sky...

409
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,820
If I photograph here everyone will know
will know it's a fake.

410
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,100
Yes, the view from these windows is terrible.

411
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,420
But in general from other windows
the view from the house is no better.

412
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,780
Hmm yes... I see.

413
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,510
However, there is something similar...

414
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,180
I told my husband many times that
I should make a window there...

415
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,310
...where the horse painting hangs.

416
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,820
This is how you could see the sky.

417
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,340
Hmm... and why is this
the living room?

418
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:40,340
My husband never cared about
home furnishings.

419
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,100
He could fight to the death for a cause,
his party in parliament... But the house...

420
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,020
He was not interested.

421
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,710
Don't tell me you don't have a window?
Which one has a slightly better view?

422
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,940
Maybe the one in the bathroom?
Maybe...

423
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:02,260
However... you understand, I can not
take the pictures in the mourning bath...

424
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,740
- Well, in the light of the afternoon...
- The design of the house is very inconvenient.

425
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,220
Instead of that bathroom window
I should use the bedroom window...

426
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,230
Yes, you could see it in the sky
just dawning from the bed...

427
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,230
How well I would sleep... wouldn't he?

428
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,310
Okay, let's go...
I'll show you.

429
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,540
Great... Don't move...
Just relax.

430
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,380
Now add some excitement...
Show that you are excited...

431
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,270
Focus on that....

432
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,780
Like this...? Relaxed... focused...

433
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,260
Yes, yes...
Oh no, that's better.

434
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,940
Yes, that's right....

435
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,420
Perfect!

436
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,020
Please continue with the
sadness on your face...

437
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,710
More feeling...

438
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,780
The funeral... If possible...
At least a tear...

439
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,420
I can't...
It's not easy.

440
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,220
I'm sure you can
handle it... don't move...

441
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,350
I can't, I could never cry...

442
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,350
Everything happens for the first time.
Don't worry.

443
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,150
Look, you understand, I almost got it.

444
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,950
At least a couple of tears, well,
please try again.

445
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,790
- But I can't.
- Let's stop taking pictures then.

446
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,260
Photography without emotion is useless
will only ruin your image.

447
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,870
But it's ridiculous...
After all, I'm sad, though I don't cry.

448
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,340
- Here you are wrong...
- And what is it if not sadness?

449
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,220
To be frank, this is something of a
a sense of relief.

450
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,110
I'm sorry, if you don't understand me,
I will throw you out of the house.

451
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,300
Forgive me but I said something
about what I see.

452
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,740
I know it is a misleading impression.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

453
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,300
You misunderstood me, it's my fault...
Maybe I expressed myself badly.

454
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,260
I understand how you feel, but you know
you know, we photographers...

455
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,150
...we often need to model the
emotions of the subject's subconscious.

456
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,740
Fabulous...
Thank you.

457
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,510
No, I was wrong, it looks better
with her hair down...

458
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,740
No, please...
There is no need.

459
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,540
She's an amazing woman
there's no need to hide it...

460
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,750
A bit of savagery...
And then, the makeup....

461
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,700
I should use warm colors,
maybe orange...

462
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,860
...maybe peach, apricot,
that suits you...

463
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,590
What? It's too bright...
I can't even think about it...

464
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,830
I'm sorry...
Don't get mad... okay?

465
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,700
Don't take this as an insult.
have your permission to put your name.

466
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,500
For what?

467
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,820
You know, I know a lot of people
in the film world...

468
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,860
And to be honest, I thought...

469
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,860
Don't worry, this is just a thought, just an idea.
a thought, just an idea.

470
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,670
But it happens to me when a woman
from the upper world...

471
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,790
Like that lady on the cover of the magazine.
I know her...

472
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,220
For me it is unthinkable...

473
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,350
Why? Such a woman, like
this one here, young, beautiful...

474
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,100
with your name...
Everyone would be delighted...

475
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,390
He would be a superstar.

476
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,270
And what should I do?

477
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,660
Ah!... Yes, mere trifles!...
Trust me, I'll fix everything.

478
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,420
- Contracts, views, photos.
- What photos?

479
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,700
I would do it myself.

480
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,140
I'd be happy to do this for you....

481
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,950
I will help you find your style.
the hairstyles, the clothes.

482
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,910
Let's go shopping tomorrow....

483
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,860
It's very nice, but it's not that simple....

484
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,860
There is one big obstacle...
My husband's name... and my reputation.

485
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,540
I can't assure you anything...

486
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,100
Don't tell me, I know.
What is morality in the world of cinema?

487
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,140
Actresses, after all, have to make
have to make concessions all the time.

488
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,020
What is there to...?
I ask you to...

489
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,420
You misunderstood me, but if
it bothers you, for example...

490
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,980
Yes, the photos in any magazine...
Here, see for yourself...

491
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,670
...half-naked girl on the grass,
she is wearing a bathing suit...

492
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,340
...and he a bathing suit...

493
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,470
I can't imagine myself with him,
in the same place.

494
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,380
Me too...
You are absolutely right.

495
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,700
If it is done this way... the quality...

496
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,220
...this can lead to opposite
opposite results.

497
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,620
Actresses do it because
not getting roles...

498
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,180
...but for a woman like you,
you need something more mysterious.

499
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,020
Woman in her thirties surrounded by
secrets, sexy, mysterious.

500
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,940
I swear I'll show you your body
and all your soul...

501
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,830
...and you don't have to...
you don't have to show anything...

502
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,940
Nothing?

503
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,110
Listen, could you sit on the
the horse just for a minute?

504
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,460
Don't move... Great...
That's it... Just relax...

505
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,460
Listen, do you have a separate
separate bathing suit?

506
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,100
No...
Just a déshabillé...

507
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,310
- What color?
- Beige with flowers.

508
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,660
Amazing...
Please put it on.

509
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,940
I already wore it.

510
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:25,020
God, it's fantastic...
All this...

511
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,260
Turn around...
Turn around again.

512
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,510
Yes...
Yes...

513
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,750
We are missing something...
Ah, yes... turning on the music?

514
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,820
- Good.
- Lift your head a little.

515
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,460
Come here.

516
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,190
Move as usual...

517
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:07,060
I need a bright light,
soft, sensual... magnificent.

518
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,780
Beautiful...
Now please relax.

519
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,110
I have an idea...
Come on.

520
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,340
And now a little more independence
independence in sight.

521
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,420
Good.

522
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,060
Here.

523
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,140
This has to be let go...
Like this... Like this.

524
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,590
- Not too much.
- No, not too much.

525
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,620
Incredible, incredible...
Stay free...

526
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,020
That's it, that's it, good.

527
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,540
Oh, let me... And now
please turn to me.

528
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,750
- Didn't we overdo it?
- No, no, it's unbelievable.

529
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,750
Yes, we go this way.

530
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,860
I want you to sit down...
make yourself comfortable.

531
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,660
Relax... Unbelievable...
It's fantastic.

532
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:38,460
So... mouth slightly ajar...
Yes, perfect.

533
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:44,430
He doesn't even know it's
a miracle... I'll come closer...

534
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,740
Beautiful.

535
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,060
More feeling, okay...
That's it, that's it.

536
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,460
Wonderful...
Don't drop your shoe...

537
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,100
There, hold it, hold it in your hand.

538
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,500
Beautiful... Raise your head...
Amazing... Just like this.

539
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,180
Yes, that's what I need...

540
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,670
It is fantastic.

541
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,790
Lean back, relax...
You are an incredible woman.

542
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,980
Trust your feelings...
Good, good.

543
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,830
Imagine you have a lover,
who slowly undresses you...

544
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,580
...he starts caressing her...
She is going crazy.

545
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,670
It's on fire, it can't wait
wait...

546
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,110
And it's the same for him.

547
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,000
AN AFTERNOON
A BIT BORING

548
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,910
Do you undress?
Or don't you undress?

549
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,230
No. I want to rest today.

550
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,350
And who told you that we are going to rest?

551
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,590
- Well, then I'll stay like this.
- What's wrong with you today?

552
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,590
Nothing is wrong with me.

553
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,270
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

554
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,060
Of course...
Do you confess it?

555
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,310
Come on, take a walk down the street,
in front of him, do you understand?

556
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,100
I want to see what your reaction is.

557
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,430
- Did you hear what I said?
- Let's get some rest, okay.

558
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,140
Do what I told you,
or I'll paint your face.

559
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,070
All right, I'm coming.

560
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,390
You always talk to me about it, and
I am a faithful woman.

561
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,790
Yes, it seems the same to me...
I knew it...

562
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,220
I will fix it.

563
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,470
- Well, are you happy now.
Are you taking me for an idiot?

564
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,820
This is your lover...
Confess him.

565
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,910
What? I don't know that person,
and you're just ridiculous.

566
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,180
Dirty whore.

567
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,620
Oh god don't start with all
this all over again, okay?

568
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,940
So you cheated on me?
Did you have a thing with that guy?

569
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,820
No wonder when you're with me,
you're so cold, you have a lover...

570
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,470
How you bore me...

571
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,900
So you are concerned?

572
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,670
A YOUNG WIFE

573
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,470
- Can I choose the ones I want?
- Of course, Professor.

574
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,670
These pears are ripe...

575
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,820
- How is your wife?
- Not bad, not bad.

576
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,340
It's been a long time since I've seen her.

577
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,870
Yes, she's so busy with the kids....
She also takes care of the apartment.

578
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,820
Besides, she is still so young and inexperienced.
young and inexperienced.

579
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,420
She must learn everything.

580
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,300
And I help her when I have time.

581
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,060
I consider her very lucky,
to meet a man like you.

582
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,790
You exaggerate.

583
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,270
Oh, no professor, I really believe it.

584
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,820
Such men are hard to find.
hard to find.

585
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,700
Yes, most men before marriage treat you
treat you with affection and kindness...

586
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,980
...but then, above all,
the more they don't lift a finger...

587
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,660
...as if they get themselves a
slave, who is supposed to serve them.

588
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,310
Do you agree with me?

589
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,550
These are our Italian women.
They are to blame for everything.

590
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,100
Do you think so...?
Well, I don't know, maybe you're right.

591
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,310
Everyone complains all the time.
But no one is trying to fight it.

592
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,860
Ah, professor, this is a
gift from me to your children.

593
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,950
It is good that at least one woman
has fallen into good hands.

594
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,000
When a person plants a rose,
it only speaks of his good taste...

595
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,630
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

596
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:18,390
- It's a funny thing.
- Don't you like it?

597
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,980
I don't want to offend you, but the taste
of this cake is a little weird.

598
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,430
Here's the thing... Why did you put
cloves in the apple pie.

599
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,990
The French do.

600
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,820
People in other countries,
do a lot of strange things.

601
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,300
I wanted to surprise you.

602
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,620
And you succeeded quite well my dear...

603
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,700
I do everything wrong. I am good for nothing.

604
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,990
Learning to cook well is not easy,
it takes practice...

605
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,660
...patience, skill.

606
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,300
So you think that I
am incapable? So...

607
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,310
Soon you will hate me.

608
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,140
Joanna, this is just ridiculous...
Well, who do I hate, you.

609
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,980
Imagine you are a student.
and in the history exam...

610
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,620
...to some questions,
you answered incorrectly.

611
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,910
And I, as your kind teacher,
underline your mistakes with a pencil.

612
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,060
Oh, if I started to hate students who make mistakes...
students who make mistakes...

613
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,580
But I am your wife.

614
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,470
I know... that's why I work
a lot with you.

615
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,830
We could have gone together to
choose the dress...

616
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,060
It was not necessary...
I went to the center.

617
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,460
Why would it be necessary
to take you so far?

618
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:33,540
And to be honest, I understand better
what clothes look good on you.

619
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,820
Well, I don't know...
But maybe this color...

620
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,420
- Yes, yellow is probably better.
- I like it.

621
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,740
Joanna, do you think I'm going to let you go out of the house
leave the house underdressed?

622
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,340
No... of course not.

623
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,790
But sometimes a woman's point of view...

624
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,380
You have to forget about everything
what you read in the magazines...

625
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,260
what your friends say about what they saw on TV.
what they saw on TV.

626
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,390
You have a husband who...
wants to help you...

627
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,060
...a husband who can
teach you how to fix yourself.

628
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,380
And frankly, your husband has
good taste... Lucky us.

629
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,940
- I let you down, didn't I?
- No, sweetie.

630
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,460
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
- What is it, my dear?

631
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,500
Yes, I understand, in bed.
I don't suit you either.

632
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,550
When you make love
you have to concentrate...

633
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,140
...you need to know the technique.

634
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,910
I try, but I'm always so excited.
I'm losing control of myself.

635
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,580
Yes, there is a big difference
between us and the animals.

636
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,710
The brain was given to us to
control over emotions.

637
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,510
- You do it well.
- I have...

638
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,910
A man is a completely different
completely different.

639
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,110
Why do you keep repeating this.

640
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,860
Are you starting to oppose me?

641
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:08,340
Joanna, sometimes you are annoying,
more than all my students.

642
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,710
- Now let's go to sleep.
- Let's not be unfair.

643
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,870
If you want, we can
try again.

644
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,310
Repeating all this? You're
turning into a real whore.

645
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,780
Are you going to punish me, Professor?

646
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:31,590
Don't bother me, you awaken
the beast in me...

647
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,750
Shh... Come on.

648
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,670
But Joanna...

649
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,470
We will play cowboys and Indians.

650
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,580
No, let's do it again... You sit
here in the very center of the room.

651
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,470
Let me read this article first, okay?
article first, okay?

652
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,350
No, let's play.

653
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,660
You got him, Mom, you got him.

654
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,750
One more knot and that's enough.

655
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,100
I saw this on TV...

656
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,150
...she tied up her husband,
and then mocked him.

657
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,870
When and in which program?
I saw it too.

658
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:39,820
No, you didn't see it... Otherwise
otherwise, it wouldn't be a surprise.

659
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,260
Yes, you are right.

660
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:57,660
You didn't expect this, did you? But
the joke's not over yet. No...

661
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,820
You'll see what a joker your little
little woman... and what she's going to do...

662
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,660
Now stand still and don't move
until I let you... okay?

663
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:20,150
What a strange mix: she is
great mother and housewife...

664
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,070
...and suddenly...

665
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,870
And just 5 years ago she was
equestrian and performing in Paris.

666
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,220
No, you can't just hate her.

667
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,020
No. In fact, in these 5 years
she has changed completely.

668
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,700
Let him have fun.

669
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,980
Mom, where are we going?
To visit grandma?

670
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,190
- Yes, my dear, on a wonderful trip.
- And daddy?

671
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,380
And Dad can't go now, but we'll tell him about our trip.
we'll tell him about our trip.

672
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,750
- Good morning, madam... Are you leaving?
- Yes, I'm leaving.

673
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,910
- And how long will it be out?
- Yes, for a long time.

674
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,860
It's been a long time since I've seen my mom....
I want to show my kids.

675
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,420
We are going to Venezuela.

676
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,540
I understand... it's wonderful...
If you only knew how much I envy you.

677
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,420
Yes, just put the mail in the
box, my husband can't move....

678
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,580
...is bound by circumstances.

679
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,530
THE OYSTER GAME

680
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:34,670
Casino robbery.
One million dollars.

681
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,580
Good evening...

682
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,180
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

683
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,020
What a wonderful night, isn't it.

684
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,550
Goodbye.

685
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,420
- How can I help you?
- My God, you scared me.

686
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,870
I am the princess's secretary...

687
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,460
Why are you trying to enter my room?

688
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,940
Wait a minute, this is my room...
This is my room...

689
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:31,100
If you want to be sure,
look, I have the key.

690
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,300
Let me see the key.

691
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,060
You are wrong, you have room 89,
turn the key over, and you have room 68.

692
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,660
So it's my room...
- You're wrong.

693
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:45,030
What a joke... Don't you think it's funny?
Whose room is this?

694
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,700
Look at this.

695
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,700
This is your room, young man.

696
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,430
Thank you, thank you...
Thank you very much.

697
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,220
- My key.
- Excuse me, please.

698
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:12,060
Good evening...
68... So I was wrong.

699
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:24,660
Take my advice, put it in the black,
it wins all the time.

700
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,420
No, no, I want to bet on red.

701
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,100
But you will lose.

702
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:33,140
No, wait a minute, you're betting
on what you want.

703
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,140
Let me play the way I like.
Okay?

704
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,260
I apologize, you are absolutely right.

705
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,580
But if you listen to me,
you will definitely win.

706
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,060
Place your bets, gentlemen.

707
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,620
Let me...
Madam, you can't.

708
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,510
No, this is the number.

709
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,420
You cannot bet.

710
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,940
Don't tell me I don't know what I should do.

711
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:59,660
I want to bet my chips on a number
above 6 and 9. Nothing works.

712
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,580
Thirty-six red.

713
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,940
This is my bet.

714
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,340
I didn't think about it. Why don't I win.

715
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,820
Bravo, bravo, you are a very intelligent woman.

716
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,220
Good, good.

717
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,180
What a thing...

718
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,630
How are you, sweetheart?

719
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,820
Oh, my poor, my good,
you missed your mother.

720
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,270
How many cookies did you give to my treasure?

721
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,220
Three.

722
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,820
- I asked him to give you 4.
- Yes ma'am, but...

723
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,590
Go up to the room,
and give him another cookie.

724
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:48,740
Does he have lovely eyes?
Let's see if we can...

725
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,620
My necklace...
My necklace...

726
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,350
My necklace...
My necklace...

727
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,110
My dear, mine is also worth a thousand,
but it's with me.

728
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,500
Come to your daddy, my love...

729
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,500
Intelligent dog.

730
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,620
- Well?
- It is not here.

731
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,230
- What does it mean?
- I'm telling you, it's gone.

732
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,700
It should be there...
I couldn't take him anywhere...

733
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,540
It was dark in there, it must be
around his neck...

734
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,220
Maybe it slipped on the belly,
look... Well?

735
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:39,700
There is nothing.

736
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,180
- I can't believe it.
- Look for yourself, it's not here.

737
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,270
Hi, I booked a ticket to Zurich...
Yes, on a four-hour flight...

738
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,660
I want to confirm the order...
First class.

739
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,500
No, no, I'll go straight to the airport...

740
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,900
Please prepare my invoice,
in 45 minutes...

741
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:06,990
Thank you.

742
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,820
Help, help.

743
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,820
Come out, come out, I don't want
to see you anymore... Don't you understand me?

744
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,300
You hurt me...
Don't touch me... Let me go...

745
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,980
I want to be alone...
Sal.

746
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,910
I am finally alone.

747
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,980
- Good evening.
- Good morning, ma'am.

748
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,500
- You can't sleep either.
- No, I tried.

749
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,950
I can't close my eyes... Sleeping late
on a night as wonderful as tonight...

750
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,140
...it is even sinful.

751
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,780
Deep down I feel...
all alone.

752
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,860
- What a beautiful speech.
- I know, but...

753
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,180
I once studied acting.

754
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:32,100
- Wait, don't go.
- But I have to go... good night.

755
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:36,780
Don't you think that a meeting on a
terrace is the destination?

756
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,860
Oh, you're a lyricist.

757
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:42,340
Juliet and Romeo...
And I like it here.

758
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:48,660
I want to give you this flower...
God, I'll have to give you another one.

759
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,300
Thank you...
But I already have one.

760
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,820
Please, take it...

761
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,740
Your presence will help me
to survive this night...

762
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,380
- Do you know what this flower is?
- No.

763
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,940
- Her name is Queen of the Night.
- "Queen of the night"?

764
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:10,910
Or "Bride of the Night", I don't remember exactly.
It all depends on the season...

765
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,300
They are so called because...
because they only bloom at night.

766
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,190
But it's a sad story,
at dawn they die.

767
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,820
Too bad, but thanks anyway.

768
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,700
Do not mention it.

769
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,380
You know, you are very beautiful at night.

770
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,620
- Only at night?
- At night and during the day too...

771
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,180
It is always.

772
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,860
I want to see you in profile...
Oh, my God...

773
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,180
Let me touch it.

774
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,860
My God, you have a face like...
a plumber's.

775
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,220
- Plumbing?
- Yes.

776
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,510
When I saw you I imagined
you were a writer...

777
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,420
Between writer and plumber
the difference is small, I confuse them.

778
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,780
Hey, please don't be angry.
Be generous.

779
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,340
In your arms I feel so weak.

780
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,470
I add wheat germ to the spaghetti.

781
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,340
Really? I was so sad...
I'm not always like this.

782
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,420
You probably think that about me...
- Are you kidding me? Quite the opposite.

783
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,790
I think, you have to suffer a lot.

784
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,950
If they see us, no one will think anything,
it's just a friendly embrace...

785
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,150
We are two lonely people.
I never lost the ability to dream.

786
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,060
Yes.

787
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,860
- Do you agree with me?
- Well, of course, I agree.

788
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,300
Yeah, I think we would...
we would be... a great couple.

789
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,420
Tell me, do you know how to dance?

790
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,260
- Yes, but why did you turn off the radio?.
- Turn it on.

791
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,230
It's much better without it.
It's more romantic.

792
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:53,260
Let's dance as we want...
Take me.

793
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:54,660
Strongly.

794
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:02,180
Imagine that you and I are dancing
to the soothing melody of Alice Cooper.

795
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:07,430
- God, it's wonderful.
- I feel very young.

796
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,790
What surprises us sometimes,
that gives us life.

797
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,740
How good it feels to be with you.

798
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,390
- And I don't love you.
- Do you really?

799
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,110
- But what does it change?
- It's OK.

800
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,540
But I have to tell you...

801
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,590
No, don't say it, because you don't love me....

802
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:26,700
...and I don't want you as a friend
friend, but that doesn't change anything.

803
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,710
The music is about to end.
let's go to my room...

804
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,900
No.

805
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,670
Look what you're doing, you're out of rhythm
out of rhythm, you stepped on my foot.

806
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,870
Let's stay here a little longer.

807
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,540
But in the room we will get to know each other better.

808
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:44,350
I beg you, do not rush our
emerging love.

809
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,270
- Let's go...
- No, wait. We've been discovered...

810
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,180
- Hide me. Could he be my husband?.
- Oh, no.

811
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:55,510
- He looks like a monk.
- We'd better get going.

812
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,670
Do you know him?

813
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:00,300
No... But he might think I'm a prostitute, curse me...
am a prostitute, curse me...

814
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,700
...or excommunicate me.

815
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,590
Don't be dramatic, he's just a monk.

816
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,180
- He was offended and left.
- Take it easy.

817
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,740
No... please don't.

818
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,230
Get a grip.

819
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,460
The charm is gone...
You think I'm nervous. I'm scared.

820
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,590
- Well, let's dance.
- No, I'm about to lose my mind...

821
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,140
Let's not ruin it and let's remember
tonight, these stars...

822
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,060
- Did you touch my ass?
- It seems so, what were you waiting for...?

823
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,900
Why does it always end up like this?

824
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:31,780
I'm talking about the stars,
about love and you only think about one thing.

825
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:36,420
I had the best of intentions.
I didn't mean to offend you.

826
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,060
No, please don't, please.
Good evening...

827
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,820
I don't want to see you anymore.

828
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,420
- Let me explain.
- Goodbye.

829
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,670
Bitch, I was entertained.

830
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:48,870
Don't you dare touch me, I'm a monk
and I wear a cassock, mind you.

831
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,780
Well... And now speak, my friend,
where is your accomplice? I am listening to you...

832
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:57,940
I don't have much time.

833
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,860
- Son, are there any empty seats here?.
- No.

834
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:23,860
Excuse me sister, we are on a
long road, and we are tired.

835
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,830
Patience is a virtue.

836
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,100
Do you want a sweet?

837
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,550
- I'll give you a blow...
- Mom, I need to go to the bathroom.

838
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,060
Ma'am, ma'am, the boy is calling you...

839
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:41,350
He says he needs a
bathroom, he wants to pee.

840
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,940
Father... Wake up...
Father.

841
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,830
Where is the necklace? Where is the...?
Where is it? Tell me where is it?

842
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,340
I don't have it, I swear.

843
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,990
And here you are, my treasure....
Come to your Father.

844
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,220
Thank God someone came...
I need your help.

845
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,270
What is going on?

846
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,340
This woman screamed, she lost consciousness.
why, I don't know.

847
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,020
Open the window, she needs air.

848
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:29,310
It's okay, we church servants are very sensitive...
of the church are very sensitive...

849
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,060
- Maybe he is hungry.
- Maybe you need a doctor?

850
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:36,110
Great idea, but it's better that
I'd better find him myself, stay with Sister.

851
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,390
No, Father, don't go, stay.

852
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:41,460
Sister, are you better now?

853
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:45,510
I will be well, if the Father
stays with me.

854
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:49,260
- You seem to have hurt your jaw.
- Yes, you are right, I did hurt myself.

855
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,980
Feeling better, Sister?
Oh, much better, much better...

856
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,310
Father will stay here,
and I will be fine.

857
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,270
In 5 minutes we arrived at Alasio.

858
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:03,140
It was just a fainting spell. God saves
and take care of this good Samaritan...

859
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,030
Sorry to bother you.

860
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:10,260
Hey, what are you doing, hitting me,
you knock me down... you hit me?.

861
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,780
What were you waiting for?

862
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:14,870
Terrible answer...
How can you behave like that, to beat...

863
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,910
...to a lonely girl, who thought
that you can be her husband?

864
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,900
Stop it... What are you saying...?
Have you lost your mind?

865
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:26,700
Whether you like it or not, now we'll part...
I'll take the necklace.

866
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,820
Someone is in for a surprise.

867
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,430
Our Brother...
He has left me.

868
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,500
I am in ecstasy.

869
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,140
And you know what you're doing, honey.

870
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,820
Champagne?

871
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:20,780
- Let's drink to us.
- To our first meeting.

872
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:26,260
When I saw you on the terrace,
I ended up losing my mind...

873
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,310
- I'm not lying.
- That's what I was looking for.

874
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,020
- Really?
- When I want to, I can...

875
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,230
Make me love you...?.
It's time.

876
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,270
- Get to work.
- Good.

877
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,260
Let's take a look.

878
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

879
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:48,060
Okay...
Now from this end to this end...

880
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:52,740
I will buy 10 elegant fur coats, because with this job
my rheumatism has broken out with this job.

881
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:54,950
Fur coats are expensive.
Let's add a couple more.

882
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,870
- Yes.
- They are still the same.

883
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,740
You say so because it is my share.

884
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:03,740
With these I will buy a car instead of the one
of the one stolen by a bastard.

885
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,870
- And about these we...
- Wait a minute...

886
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:10,150
And these, I thought with these
we could buy a house.

887
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,420
Buying a house...?.
Are you thinking about our future?

888
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:19,300
- We will be together.
- Beautiful... Caribbean Sea?

889
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:20,820
What's so good about it?

890
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,420
I prefer the mountains...
A secluded place.

891
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:26,150
Let's see what we can buy...

892
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,500
Wait a minute...
House in the mountains.

893
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,790
Another one in Cortigny, it is a villa.
This one with a view from the window...

894
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:36,020
40 thousand is silly...
We can afford it... 40 thousand.

895
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,580
Calm down...
We'll buy furniture with this.

896
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,710
- How about these?
- How much is left?

897
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,460
What will we spend them on?

898
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,140
- I'll buy you a necklace, do you like the idea.
- Let's buy everything.

899
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:55,100
"The necklace stolen from the princess
in the casino - a forgery".

900
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:08,460
Well...

901
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,180
Listen...

902
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,980
The necklace, what do we do with it?

903
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,350
It costs nothing.

904
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:29,500
I understand, but I don't care.
It's very expensive, even if it's fake.

905
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,110
Why?

906
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:35,790
Yes, because it helped us to get to know each other,
you understand...

907
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,510
...to spend time together.

908
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,030
Even if we were to agree for a minute,
like two approaching trains...

909
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:45,790
...that somehow sweep through the night
in different directions, and keep on walking.

910
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:49,420
No. I was acting...
But it's enough for me...

911
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:53,220
I would like to have the
necklace as a souvenir.

912
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,430
- Okay.
- Let me have it.

913
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,500
No, I have a friend who
could pay something for it.

914
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,660
I can try to ask you for more.

915
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:04,100
Stop doing this...
By saying that, you ruin everything...

916
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,420
I don't need it anymore, I leave it to you.

917
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:13,620
Hey wait, I was kidding.
I already put it in your bag.

918
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:16,150
You are a wonderful person.

919
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:22,110
I regret having started
to doubt... What is your name?

920
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:26,030
- Angelo... What about you?
- Maria.

921
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

922
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,420
Goodbye.

923
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,940
Let me see your paper please.

924
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:52,620
Please.

925
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:58,220
Sorry, I played a little joke on a friend
a little joke... Here.

926
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,140
I love a good joke.

927
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:03,030
Stop the bus.
I need to get out.

928
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,340
- And so am I.
- Don't let it out.

929
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,270
- Hey, thief, come back.
- Don't let her near me.

930
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,470
I'll show you some jokes,
you'll die laughing.

931
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,440
A WOMAN IN THE STREET

932
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,430
- Let's discuss it.
- Yes, next time.

933
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,430
Just look at that.

934
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,980
Hey, hello.

935
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:22,340
Guys, what are you waiting for?
Get out there with the tow vehicles.

936
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:32,380
So, Alfa Romeo - tank and wing...
Fiat 131 - front fender and tank...

937
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,710
BMW - hood, radiator, headlights,
pump, steering...

938
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,620
Motorboat, Peugeot, Ford and two Volvos,
well broken...

939
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,710
You did a very professional job...

940
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,070
So... 10 percent...
- No, no, no, no, no, 15.

941
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:51,020
Well, I agree...
I agree with fifteen...

942
01:11:51,910 --> 01:12:00,020
So your share will be 1973....
Make it 1970, I round the amount.

943
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,780
- No, round up to two thousand.
- You are killing the dying.

944
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,900
But I know you, and you know me.

945
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,180
Is everything covered?

946
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:15,420
Well, of course, have I ever
cheated on you, my dear?

947
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,510
At least in business...
Take a look at it.

948
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:24,070
- Thank you.
- Please.

949
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,660
See you?

950
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:31,140
Good. But only in 3 or 4 weeks...
I have a lot of work to do.

951
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:34,190
In a month...?
Let's see...

952
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,620
That week on Friday I have
Joe's garage in Naples...

953
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:46,220
A week later in Milan...
I will call you from Monte Carlo.

954
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,580
Don't forget.

955
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:51,420
Well, of course... But not here...
not too often...

956
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,590
What about your brother's garage?

957
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,140
You are a genius... Tomorrow I will
I'll call you in the morning, beautiful.

958
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:59,030
- Goodbye, thank you.
- Goodbye.

959
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,810
I'll take care of the crashes
and you take care of the breaks, dear.

960
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:09,520
THE BUSINESSWOMAN

961
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:20,060
- I can't help it.
- Are you going to start again?

962
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:23,430
This is the woman of my dreams.
I have to stop her.

963
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,980
Stop, she will send you flying.

964
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,380
It is worth a try.

965
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:32,750
Excuse me. Don't think anything bad,
but I need to talk to you.

966
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,310
I would like to...

967
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:38,150
But unfortunately,
I have a meeting and I'm late.

968
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,430
Maybe you could make an appointment for me.

969
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:45,030
- Better leave me your name and address.
- Yes, yes, I have a card.

970
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,540
Here.

971
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,270
- Is 4 o'clock okay?
- Where do we meet?

972
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,470
Of course you have to be at home today.
be at home today.

973
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,740
Are you kidding me?

974
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:59,950
- Are you a chauffeur or a train driver?
- Musician, I am a conductor.

975
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,500
So you have an audience...
Pop or classical music?

976
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,180
None...
Please, tell me what is your name.

977
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,990
- Giovanna.
- Giovanna.

978
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,510
- So I'll be there at 4:00.
okay? - Of course I will.

979
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:13,620
Yes.

980
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,820
- And well...?
- It worked.

981
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,020
Yes?

982
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:15,510
Yes, I was just about to leave...
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

983
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,460
So you're coming?
Something always happens.

984
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,460
The oboe did not arrive, it has to be replaced.

985
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:27,070
It's just awful... Well, find
someone, you can't work like that.

986
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:28,660
See you soon.

987
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,470
- Perfect... Telepathy.
- Go ahead.

988
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:49,380
I'm sorry I'm late,
but there are so many cars on the street.

989
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:52,060
Don't apologize, don't worry.

990
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:57,220
What a nice apartment...
This is exactly how I imagined everything.

991
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,710
And this is for you...
I hope you like roses.

992
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:00,780
For me?

993
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:04,910
Flowers and music always go together...
They look good in singles' rooms.

994
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:07,500
That's what I should do...
buy you flowers.

995
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,180
- Do you have a vase?
- A vase...? Of course I have a vase.

996
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:13,740
While you are placing the flowers,
can I make a phone call?

997
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,470
There's everything here. Everything but...

998
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,860
...the telephone, which is
bedside.

999
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,460
But that's the right place...
so convenient...

1000
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,220
I'll show you where it is.

1001
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,100
Make yourself comfortable.

1002
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,950
I may be needed urgently,
can I give out your number just in case.

1003
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,620
Of course you can,
make yourself at home.

1004
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:37,180
You are an angel.

1005
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:58,180
No, that's what we're talking about.
It was not in the agreement...

1006
01:16:58,350 --> 01:16:59,670
I know...

1007
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,500
Yes.

1008
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:09,310
Yes, I remember that it wasn't like that at all....
I'm sure I'm not wrong...

1009
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:20,180
No, no, my dear Macketty,
that's no way to do business...

1010
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:21,540
No, no, sorry...

1011
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:24,620
If you change your mind, just say so
I will understand everything...

1012
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:28,500
But this... if you claim that
my terms do not suit you...

1013
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,630
...you consider that there is no contract.

1014
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,910
I'm sorry, but I
should have called...

1015
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:37,110
Everything has to fit...
Come on, get undressed quickly.

1016
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:41,190
No, no, I think we'd better
forget our contract...

1017
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:44,140
No, I refuse to change anything about it....

1018
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:48,780
Then we'd better forget about him...
forget about him... Listen...

1019
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:50,550
No, listen to me...

1020
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:54,070
I called you to sign a contract,
not to modify it...

1021
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:58,270
I don't want to talk about it anymore...
This land is worth more than a million.

1022
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:12,940
I know your position, but it will not
affect your plans in any way.

1023
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:17,900
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
It's just not practical...

1024
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:25,260
If you want to do business, do it the
the right way... I'm out of patience...

1025
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:31,990
But listen, I don't want to discuss
this any more in any way...

1026
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,180
Goodbye.

1027
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,300
I'm sorry, I think I burned your shoulder.

1028
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:43,820
Just a little bit, it doesn't hurt at all.

1029
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:49,180
I hate to do at the same time
love and works at the same time, but...

1030
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,580
... you have to take care of
absolutely everything...

1031
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:57,070
But I like you even more like this.

1032
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,260
Sorry, I will answer the phone.

1033
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:05,780
Of course...
If it's for me, then I'm not.

1034
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,070
Hello?
We have already spoken...

1035
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:12,180
No contracts with such an idiot.
We'll find someone better...

1036
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:15,500
He is unable to do it...
He's going to overcharge me...

1037
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,710
He understands perfectly well that this
land is getting more expensive... No...

1038
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,180
There are 3 other people
who want to buy it...

1039
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:25,550
He called you back, because he agrees, but now I don't agree...
agreed, but now I don't agree...

1040
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:30,580
Honey, in a second I'll be ready
and you'll forget all my conversations...

1041
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,830
No, no... What...
Yeah, you look like you're kidding...

1042
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:38,620
But... Are you out of your mind?
I'll fire you...

1043
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,590
I'm tired of all this...

1044
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,310
I'll be there in 10 minutes...

1045
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:48,590
Now I'm going to negotiate it, this will be
a good lesson for him...

1046
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,430
Of course I will, yes....

1047
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,700
No, no, of course there is no
deal with this amateur idiot...

1048
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,300
It's just plain dumb...

1049
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,870
No, so I decided that I will finally do it.
I realized what the real deal is....

1050
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,620
Call my lawyer...

1051
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:07,070
I know we're going to lose on this,
but I want you to understand...

1052
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,420
See you in 15 minutes.

1053
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:11,540
Hello.

1054
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,380
Look what happens when you relax
you relax a little.

1055
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:23,380
Why aren't you dressed yet?
We haven't finished yet, have we.

1056
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:24,590
No.

1057
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,740
- Do you have a car?
- Of course I do.

1058
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:30,380
Then you come with me...
Okay?

1059
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:34,750
I'll take care of this and we'll get back
back together...

1060
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,790
- Oh, of course.
- My hero.

1061
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:43,470
For God's sake, hurry up, otherwise I'll be late...
otherwise I'll be late... Move to that lane.

1062
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,820
But you ordered me to shift to the left.

1063
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:50,030
That was 5 minutes ago...
Let's be more aggressive, shall we.

1064
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,940
Honey, don't be angry...

1065
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,580
Since we left the apartment
you never hugged me.

1066
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,420
- But I'm driving.
- So you don't love me anymore.

1067
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,020
Oh, boy.

1068
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:09,070
Then why don't you caress me?
Won't you hold me?

1069
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:11,270
Make me light up.

1070
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:18,030
Look at the road...
do you want us to crash?.

1071
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,750
How stupid is this...

1072
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,110
Do you know the 18th position of the
Chinese rhythm?

1073
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,940
No.

1074
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:32,580
Come back, I'll show you...
Stop.

1075
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:34,700
Are we there?

1076
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,020
No, I want to buy a
lighter and cigarettes.

1077
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,180
You can't stop here.

1078
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:42,470
I'm leaving for a minute... And while I'm
I'm gone, you see that tent?

1079
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,430
Yes.

1080
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,740
Buy me 3 pairs of lace panties.

1081
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,060
I don't know what...

1082
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,110
I'll tell you. The same as these,
same style...

1083
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:53,380
You saw them today, didn't you.
Thank you.

1084
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:58,500
Panties.

1085
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:08,070
Excuse me. Please excuse me...
Excuse me... Let me pass.

1086
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,820
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

1087
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,540
What do you want?

1088
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:21,220
- I need 3 pairs of underwear.
- We do not sell men's underwear here.

1089
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:24,980
I need lingerie for my wife....
She asked me for french lace.

1090
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:27,030
Ah, French...
Yes, we do.

1091
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,100
- Can I make a phone call?
- Of course you can.

1092
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:45,190
Hi, this is Sabinny... Connect me,
please connect me to Roberti...

1093
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:46,180
Thank you.

1094
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,860
- What color?
- White or black...?

1095
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,310
Armando...?
Well...

1096
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:54,780
Listen, I have an emergency...
A problem...

1097
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,340
No, listen to me, Armando...
I'm calling from a pharmacy...

1098
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,700
Can we move the recording
until 6:00 a.m..

1099
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,670
At six o'clock...? What's the matter?
Is it serious?

1100
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,660
No, no, I wanted to tell you that...
I'll explain everything later...

1101
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,300
Yeah, and give the kids something to drink... sorry...
drink... sorry...

1102
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,460
Tell them that I pay for everything...

1103
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:17,020
So I'll see you at 6:00.
Yes. Bye.

1104
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,700
So small?

1105
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:29,180
Tell me something indecent... exciting.

1106
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:35,510
Not bad, not bad...
But I think it is very difficult...

1107
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:38,470
Only you support me...
and then nothing happens...

1108
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:40,620
This is just a little intrigue.

1109
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:47,820
Listen, Macketty, since you
are against this contract...

1110
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:52,180
Mr. Spadini is here with me,
he agrees to enter into a contract with me.

1111
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:53,780
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

1112
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,060
Have a seat.

1113
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:59,380
I didn't want to back out of the contract.
I just wanted to add some...

1114
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:02,910
No, listen, I'm already tired
of statements like this...

1115
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,140
Mr. Macketty, are you not satisfied?

1116
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,460
If you don't mind...

1117
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,430
Too late...
That's why I brought Maestro Spadini...

1118
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,550
- You want to conclude this contract.
- Do I?

1119
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,460
Tell him you offered me 50 thousand
to get this contract.

1120
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:17,430
I...

1121
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:21,660
Don't worry, no one but us
and Mr. Macketty will find out.

1122
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:22,580
I...

1123
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,550
- Well, Spadini, we are waiting.
- But...

1124
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:29,230
This is a new, permanent contract,
just sign... Now...

1125
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:31,500
No, I'm sorry, wait a minute...
Wait a minute.

1126
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:33,020
Signature, Spadini.

1127
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,750
Wait...
Oh, I sign?

1128
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:36,870
- What's wrong?
- Do not sign.

1129
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,860
Do not be afraid, because I suggested
to sign the contract.

1130
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,940
- I am signing.
- What are you waiting for?

1131
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,260
Give me back my contract.

1132
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:46,310
- Ardini, was the surveyor there?
- Yes, he is already there.

1133
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:49,190
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- Well, of course.

1134
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,380
Let's go.

1135
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:56,830
Ardini, I can't go.

1136
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:59,140
But you made the appointment yourself.

1137
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:01,780
But I can't give up.
Master Spadini is here.

1138
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,860
We are far behind.

1139
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,830
Wait, I'll deal with him,
about the next meeting.

1140
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:10,380
McKetty signed a contract...?.
Spadini, you're a sweetheart...

1141
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,110
You see, everything is simple.

1142
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,940
There's a problem: I have an appointment...

1143
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:19,100
Let's go together, we'll do a couple of
minutes to be together...

1144
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:21,860
I can't wait as long as we're alone...

1145
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,220
I'm waiting for you in the car.

1146
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:35,910
Madam is here...
Good to see you, ma'am...

1147
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:38,190
The surveyor went to town...
to a bar...

1148
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:42,500
He said he would find it there...
He has been waiting for it for a long time.

1149
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:45,380
- What do we do, Ardini?
- I'll bring him in.

1150
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:47,220
Thank you... And hurry up.

1151
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:51,470
- Here you can find a strong man.
- Yes.

1152
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,830
My son is strong,
now he is in the stable.

1153
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:57,660
My friend is not feeling well
needs something to drink...

1154
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,270
And besides, could you lie down
somewhere?

1155
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,620
We have a bed.

1156
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,750
Could you call his son?

1157
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:07,310
We'll help you get into bed.

1158
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:08,350
I am fine.

1159
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,700
You have to lie down,
and I'll take care of you.

1160
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:11,820
You are crazy.

1161
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,790
He is dying, could you take him.

1162
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:17,340
Let me go, let me go...
It's all right.

1163
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,420
He needs to be put to bed.

1164
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:22,550
Don't worry, Mr. Spadini,
You'll get better...

1165
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,220
Get some rest first.

1166
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,780
- Wait, where are we?
- In the bedroom.

1167
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,860
You will soon come to your senses...
That's all... Don't worry...

1168
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:36,150
Peace and tranquility
work wonders. Thank you...

1169
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,500
You'd better leave us in peace...

1170
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:43,220
Maybe it's contagious, and I'm talking about him.
I'll take care of it... Thanks for everything...

1171
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:44,420
Thank you.

1172
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,790
Take off your pants quickly.

1173
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,100
- What? Here?
- Yes, here.

1174
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,540
Here, now?

1175
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:55,420
The country air doesn't hurt,
Do you want to do it with me?

1176
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,060
What air...?
How to smell it.

1177
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,620
Understand...
I want to make love to you.

1178
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,980
But anyone can come in
and catch us.

1179
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,060
Relax. Don't worry.

1180
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:13,070
- Wait, I'll get undressed.
- You can do it like this.

1181
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:16,460
No, no, I have to get undressed...
it's quick.

1182
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,620
Really, why don't you untie
the tie.

1183
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:26,270
Please... For the love of God,
hurry up... We have little time.

1184
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:31,620
The hand is stuck.

1185
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,510
Mrs. Giovanna.

1186
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:37,940
I told you we were short on time
time, and you didn't listen to me.

1187
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:43,180
- Mrs. Giovanna.
- Wait... Giovanna.

1188
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,100
No.

1189
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,660
What happened to Master Spadini?

1190
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:53,060
Overheated by the sun...
It's better now.

1191
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:54,110
I am pleased to hear it.

1192
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,780
We have now advanced
from quota 103 to 107...

1193
01:27:56,950 --> 01:28:01,310
We need to have an average of 105.
We are required by law here.

1194
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:04,110
What about expenses?
You will need 20 days.

1195
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:08,100
About 600 thousand cubic meters of land,
gives a total of about $ 3,000.

1196
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:12,660
This can be done in 2 weeks.
I will not pay more than 2000...

1197
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:13,900
Do you understand me?

1198
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:29,420
- Where is he?
- Upstairs...

1199
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,460
Follow me...

1200
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:36,710
It probably got worse.

1201
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:40,460
When I left, everything was in order.
Did anyone call an ambulance?

1202
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:43,510
My son... Because of him, animals
can become infected.

1203
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:47,460
Don't touch me, I'm fine...
I don't need an ambulance.

1204
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:52,230
I'll go with him to the hospital, otherwise
we won't get to the ministry at 6 o'clock.

1205
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:54,700
This is a great opportunity...
Take care of things.

1206
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:59,100
- But what about earthworks?
- You decide for me.

1207
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,950
- But what if they don't agree?
- They will.

1208
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:08,270
No, no, wait, I'll take care of it myself.

1209
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,260
- My head.
- What's going on?

1210
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,580
The road is closed.

1211
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:23,070
- What are you talking about? There's a sick
a sick man. - You can't come in.

1212
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:26,350
- I am late for the ministry.
- Are you leaving?

1213
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:30,540
I'm going with you... I need
make an urgent call.

1214
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:35,070
How do we explain at the
hospital, that he left?

1215
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,980
I will pay you for your concern.

1216
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:39,790
What happens if he dies?
He's going to get me in trouble.

1217
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,750
We've been stuck
here for a long time...

1218
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:45,300
I have to go, otherwise I'll be late for the
ministry... See you at 8:00 am.

1219
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:46,980
But what am I going to say at the hospital?

1220
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:50,550
Don't worry, it's just in case
you have something, they will test you.

1221
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:53,380
Hey, come in, don't waste your time.

1222
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:57,700
They took me to a hospital,
they said I was sick.

1223
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:01,470
Don't be afraid, I will have x-rays,
blood tests, etc.

1224
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,190
Why didn't you say that
from the beginning.

1225
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,820
I didn't want you to worry.

1226
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:08,700
Why should I be worried...?.

1227
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:12,620
Here the situation is dramatic...
30 musicians are idle...

1228
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,430
It is 4 or 5 thousand dollars.

1229
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:18,220
I said I'm going to pay... After all,
I'm in a hospital. What can I do.

1230
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:21,860
- Do you want to talk to the doctor?
- Why should I talk to him?

1231
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:24,100
What time will you arrive at the studio?

1232
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,540
Don't hang up, wait...
At 9:00 a.m.

1233
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,440
I promise to be there at 9:00 am.
We will record at 9:00 am.

1234
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,302
Will you forgive me?

1235
01:30:42,372 --> 01:30:44,546
We have to hurry,
we only have 20 minutes.

1236
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,700
So?

1237
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:47,500
Our train leaves in 20 minutes.

1238
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:51,025
- Are we going somewhere?
- I have a meeting tomorrow in Milan.

1239
01:30:51,185 --> 01:30:53,829
- What will you do in Milan?
What a silly question...

1240
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:55,872
Trying to fix everything.

1241
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:58,386
Take it easy...
I have an appointment at 9:00 p.m. tonight.

1242
01:30:58,556 --> 01:31:01,711
Cancel it... There is a phone in
the station... Have you already paid?

1243
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:03,713
No... Do you want something?

1244
01:31:03,884 --> 01:31:07,479
I'll have a drink on the train... It's ok...
Let's run, otherwise we'll be late.

1245
01:31:07,549 --> 01:31:08,581
Yes...
Yes.

1246
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:15,451
I bought you a toothbrush, pajamas,
bathing suit and electric shaver...

1247
01:31:15,621 --> 01:31:17,934
Don't worry, you'll feel better
in bed, immediately.

1248
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,827
Oh, yes, yes.

1249
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:23,433
- Did you make love on a train?.
- No.

1250
01:31:25,035 --> 01:31:27,549
It's great, everything oscillates there.

1251
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:33,838
Armando...? Armando, cancel
the session. I can't today...

1252
01:31:34,008 --> 01:31:35,360
No, I'm sorry, I can't...

1253
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:38,334
The only way out is for you
to conduct the orchestra...

1254
01:31:38,495 --> 01:31:41,619
I will pay you... It could be
the beginning of your career.

1255
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:44,133
You're crazy...
I can't do it...

1256
01:31:44,303 --> 01:31:48,349
I know the notes, but there is a complex
piece with piano and trumpets.

1257
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:51,714
It's simple: you need to start slow,
and then a crescendo... Got it...?

1258
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:55,790
Don't worry, everything will be fine...
Great... Thanks my friend...

1259
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,033
Goodbye Armando.

1260
01:32:08,178 --> 01:32:11,543
Come on, get undressed.
I was starting to worry...

1261
01:32:11,704 --> 01:32:14,698
How can you take so long
talking on the phone?

1262
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:17,993
- But I had to make a phone call.
- Don't you want to have fun now.

1263
01:32:18,153 --> 01:32:20,116
We are at the station, you can see us.

1264
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:22,870
Let's drop the curtains,
no one will see us.

1265
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,674
Ah, the curtains, yes...
Wait a second.

1266
01:32:32,895 --> 01:32:36,099
It's crazy...
He looks like General Busardi...

1267
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:42,379
Hey, General, General Buzardi...
I'm here, General.

1268
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:48,197
What's happening now...?
What are you doing?

1269
01:32:48,478 --> 01:32:53,115
I'm getting dressed... I need to talk
to someone... I'll be right back.

1270
01:32:53,445 --> 01:32:55,518
In the meantime, I will brush
my teeth.

1271
01:32:55,969 --> 01:33:00,205
General Busardi. General Busardi, we have
an appointment in Milan tomorrow night.

1272
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:04,011
I decided to come here and told
my secretary to let you know.

1273
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:06,494
My secretary didn't tell me anything
about it in the office today...

1274
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,979
He probably couldn't find me...
Good thing I looked out the window.

1275
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,221
Wait a minute.

1276
01:33:11,432 --> 01:33:14,396
- I'll be here in a minute.
- Okay.

1277
01:33:14,556 --> 01:33:18,682
Maestro... Spadini...
Open the window...

1278
01:33:19,483 --> 01:33:23,399
- I can't go... Come out soon.
- I'm in my pajamas.

1279
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:26,964
- Were you too impatient?
- What will I do in Milan?

1280
01:33:27,175 --> 01:33:30,930
- That's what I'm thinking too.
- Maybe it's better to get off in Florence?

1281
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,305
Better go to Milan... There is a plane
in the morning from there at 8:00 am.

1282
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:36,108
- Airplane?
- So you come back.

1283
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:39,743
- And don't forget my luggage.
- Yes, your suitcases.

1284
01:33:39,913 --> 01:33:43,148
Maybe you don't have any money with you?
Here, give it back to me later.

1285
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:45,231
As soon as you arrive
call me on the phone...

1286
01:33:45,402 --> 01:33:48,476
We'll spend the weekend together.
Agreed? We can't do anything else.

1287
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:52,762
Don't forget to call...
Goodbye...

1288
01:34:01,185 --> 01:34:04,389
Why is this happening to me?
Why this punishment for me?

1289
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,573
Why don't I go to Denmark!
