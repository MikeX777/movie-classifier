00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,484
<i>This is the city's heat wave warning.</i>

2
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,086
<i>Global warming has reached crisis point,</i>

3
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,587
<i>temperatures are at a record high.</i>

4
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,658
<i>This is the Shenzhen weather forecast.</i>

5
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,793
<i>Today's temperature is the highest ever.</i>

6
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,156
<i>Demand for electricity is never ending.</i>

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,300
<i>Please reduce your energy consumption.</i>

8
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:26,431
<i>Several governments have announced</i>

9
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,398
<i>ways for the public to keep cool.</i>

10
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,736
Ahhh, it's so hot!

11
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:37,606
You're useless!

12
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:41,342
The AC just broke down again!

13
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,486
Hey, Wai, did you hear me?

14
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,450
Don't blame me.

15
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,283
You should replace it.

16
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,515
At least it lasted through the night.

17
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,352
You promised it would work!

18
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,256
I'm going home to eat.

19
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:00,834
What're you doing, man?

20
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,163
Don't ever touch my radio!

21
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,296
Sorry... Sorry!

22
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,299
I'll fire you!

23
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,274
Hurry up,

24
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,541
everything in the fridge is melting.

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,446
Okay, I'm working on it!

26
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,610
My money... My money!

27
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,516
Stop pestering me!

28
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,782
<i>Have you noticed recently that</i>

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,952
<i>people get angry all the time?</i>

30
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,293
More... More.

31
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,632
One more... Here.

32
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,234
<i>How does the weather affect emotions?</i>

33
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,634
Did your dad die or something?

34
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:35,932
<i>In such hot weather,</i>

35
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,030
<i>how can we remain calm?</i>

36
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,839
Hey, babe, fancy hearing a joke?

37
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,181
What animal has two legs and

38
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:48,344
wakes you up when the sun rises?

39
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,247
That's easy... A rooster!

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,183
- No, your mom!
- My mom...

41
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,715
Rent an umbrella?

42
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,451
It's frozen!

43
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,724
Pretty girl, want a popsicle?

44
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,233
<i>This is the hottest year ever in HK.</i>

45
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,533
<i>Feel so bad!</i>

46
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,040
<i>But what can we do?</i>

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,268
<i>Move to the North Pole!</i>

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,174
<i>So cool there.</i>

49
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,842
Hong Kong is really hot!

50
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,711
Please go there, thank you!

51
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,450
Going for sushi as soon as you land?

52
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,752
Is it really that good?

53
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,015
It's too hot.

54
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,192
The fish won't be fresh.

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,452
Master Chef, the fish has arrived.

56
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,387
Let's get started!

57
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,795
How long will you stay in Hong Kong?

58
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,364
I'm not just visiting.

59
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,062
I won't be leaving this time.

60
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:41,225
What's up with you?

61
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,532
No, your dad's dead!

62
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,573
- Nothing! You are nothing!
- I've never seen a photographer like you.

63
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,108
Thank you!

64
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,872
You're nuts, stop there!

65
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:52,540
Wrap!

66
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,111
Honey,

67
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,985
I feel so blessed today.

68
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,385
I wish it were hot all year round,

69
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,921
then I'd be really rich!

70
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,587
Cheers!

71
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,458
<i>Do you want to know how hot 42 °C is?</i>

72
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,292
<i>Look at this!</i>

73
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,096
<i>The egg is cooked!</i>

74
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,328
Come here.

75
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,032
You're the best pianist.

76
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,133
Thank you.

77
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,677
<i>But I won't hire you.</i>

78
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:58,245
Why? I really need this job.

79
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:00,006
I don't even have money to eat.

80
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,980
<i>You're Li Yan, right? Unfortunately,</i>

81
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,643
you're just not hot enough.

82
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,653
I'm hiring her instead, understand?

83
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,650
However...

84
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,519
<i>If you can dress sexier,</i>

85
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,153
I'll reconsider.

86
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,388
In your dreams!

87
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,244
Foot masseurs wanted

88
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,918
<i>Do you have any experience?</i>

89
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,053
<i>I've had extensive training.</i>

90
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,656
I have strong

91
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:44,190
<i>and flexible fingers,</i>

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,418
skillful, rhythmical.

93
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,133
No. 98, you can start tomorrow.

94
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,434
Thank you!

95
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,182
<i>Both of my marriages were failures!</i>

96
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:14,848
What happened?

97
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,388
My first wife ran away.

98
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,224
What about the second one?

99
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,091
She won't leave me!

100
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,062
Freedom is precious.

101
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:28,965
Why tie yourself down?

102
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,164
Do you mean her?

103
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,365
You can't keep

104
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,565
your eyes off her.

105
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,800
She's not easy to catch.

106
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,536
What if I can? What would you bet?

107
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,271
Well, what do you want?

108
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,880
Your watch.

109
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,209
No way! It's from my days in the army.

110
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,814
So, you wanna bet or not?

111
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,456
And what if you fail?

112
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,220
I'll work for free the whole summer!

113
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,062
Deal!

114
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,400
Hey, pretty girl, fancy a popsicle?

115
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,667
No.

116
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,670
<i>But it's free today!</i>

117
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,340
<i>But I have one question for you first.</i>

118
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,609
What is it?

119
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,517
Will you be my girlfriend?

120
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:19,914
Keep your popsicle!

121
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,458
My wages will be docked if I'm late.

122
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,824
Then, say "yes".

123
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,018
You...

124
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,955
All right.

125
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:30,356
Prove your sincerity,

126
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,194
stand over there every day at noon

127
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:34,001
for 100 days!

128
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,800
Are you joking? It's so hot!

129
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,306
- Okay, never mind.
- No... Deal...

130
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,974
Okay, one hundred days... Deal!

131
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:57,058
You'll be my girl in 100 days!

132
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,363
Lunchtime!

133
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,043
A scorching day...

134
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,472
Isn't he hot?

135
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,673
What is it?

136
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,508
There's a fool standing over in the sun!

137
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,646
No kidding!

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,486
Do you know him?

139
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,830
No way! He's crazy!

140
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,391
Let's go!

141
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,193
Go ahead, I'll be there in a moment.

142
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,529
Come quickly.

143
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,280
Got many towels to dry?

144
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,220
You'll get used to the swollen fingers.

145
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,554
98, there's a customer!

146
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,363
<i>Boss.</i>

147
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:53,799
<i>Boss!</i>

148
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,367
What?

149
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,605
The car...

150
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,482
It's overheating!

151
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,015
Go take a look!

152
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,435
<i>Just heatstroke. No big deal. It's okay.</i>

153
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,680
<i>Your number's changed again.</i>

154
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,218
<i>How'd you know I'm sick?</i>

155
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,355
What number?

156
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,961
<i>I didn't change my number.</i>

157
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,996
<i>Conductor, you're my only friend in HK.</i>

158
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,227
<i>Are you making fun of me?</i>

159
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,377
Conductor? Who's that?

160
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,881
Who is this?

161
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:11,379
This... Hey, who are you?

162
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,517
You sent me the message! Who are you?

163
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,186
Who am I?

164
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,263
<i>I've a friend in Shenzhen. Wrong number.</i>

165
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,565
Wrong this, wrong that, what a fool!

166
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,168
<i>Overseas SMS is very expensive, idiot!</i>

167
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,338
Sorry.

168
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,544
Sorry...

169
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,269
<i>I need someone to talk to right now.</i>

170
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,208
<i>Isn't it very expensive?</i>

171
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,786
<i>Do you have a dream?</i>

172
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:25,451
<i>Of course!</i>

173
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,721
<i>What do you do? Why are you sick?</i>

174
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,803
I'm a pianist.

175
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,938
I was performing outdoors today.

176
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,272
<i>The sun was too hot,</i>

177
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,847
<i>and I passed out.</i>

178
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,075
<i>How about you?</i>

179
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,147
Pianist?

180
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,415
I'm

181
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,155
a driver.

182
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,658
I'm a Ferrari racer.

183
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,804
Ferrari!

184
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,669
Really?

185
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,818
You know what?

186
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,692
<i>Experts say that when you're in love,</i>

187
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,731
words spoken in the right ear

188
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,300
are sweeter.

189
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,864
<i>But you're on my left now.</i>

190
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:46,303
Am I on your left? Will you marry me?

191
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,170
Why do I have to marry you?

192
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,507
We're the only ones of our species here.

193
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:55,206
Hold on! I wanna see what they're doing!

194
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,744
Who?

195
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,082
Something's going on between them.

196
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,559
It's not my concern. I care only for you.

197
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:08,060
Spawning season is coming!
Please marry me?

198
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,254
You?

199
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,698
I'll only marry you

200
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,998
if they kiss each other.

201
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,099
What? That mass murderer?

202
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,269
No soy sauce necessary!

203
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:24,904
Poisonous?

204
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,278
Taste the seaweed beneath the fish.

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,078
<i>But I love</i>

206
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,014
soy sauce.

207
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,855
Your face is as dark as soy sauce...

208
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:43,959
Still so uptight.

209
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,600
Master Soy Sauce.

210
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,598
This nickname is so perfect for you.

211
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,432
Your nickname is no better.

212
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,039
Did people laugh at you overseas?

213
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,107
Not at all, Wasabi

214
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:55,709
sounds cute and is easy to remember!

215
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,992
Is it too spicy? Too much wasabi?

216
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,631
I just haven't tasted this for so long.

217
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:30,904
Hey...

218
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,406
How's your book?

219
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,343
<i>You finished writing The Perfect Meal?</i>

220
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,748
Now that you're your own boss,

221
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,152
can't we be together?

222
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,685
You said you'd finish the book first.

223
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:47,589
Only because you needed more time.

224
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,990
In a year,

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,963
I traveled all over the world,

226
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,031
but I couldn't find the perfect meal.

227
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
I returned when this restaurant opened

228
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,803
because I believe

229
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:05,311
I can find the most perfect meal here.

230
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:09,512
You have a restaurant now, you're not

231
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,776
some bloke hanging out in the kitchen.

232
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,682
I barely finished elementary school.

233
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,052
Give me more time.

234
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,384
Even if I waited another 100 years,

235
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,323
you'd still be just an elementary grad.

236
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,657
Fine...

237
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,894
Give me back the postcards
and recipes that I sent.

238
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:27,993
All of them!

239
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,162
I trashed them.

240
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,314
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

241
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,650
Not again!

242
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,113
I've failed.

243
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,616
Show me, show me!

244
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,052
No...

245
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,917
<i>Sexy!</i>

246
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,120
More... Come on.

247
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,523
Show me!

248
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,461
<i>Don't you know sexy? But you're a woman.</i>

249
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,768
Da Fu!

250
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,202
I'm a man. Man! Man!

251
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:40,705
I don't want this,

252
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:41,868
not like this!

253
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,036
Look at my eyes!

254
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:45,112
No good! Try again...

255
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,575
Come on...

256
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,377
<i>No... Not sexy enough.</i>

257
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,509
<i>Sexy!</i>

258
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,488
The last 3 hours are wasted.

259
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,482
<i>Why? But she's been great!</i>

260
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:58,785
What do you know?

261
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,227
Leslie, calm down.

262
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,296
Yuan Yuan has potential.

263
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,898
We believe within a year or two...

264
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,762
<i>She belongs in a wax museum.</i>

265
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,835
I can't photograph her. Find someone!

266
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,296
What's wrong with me?

267
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,399
You're just awful.

268
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:14,567
What are you talking about?

269
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:15,735
I've told you.

270
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,606
Your eyes are completely empty!

271
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,145
You are empty, can't you see?

272
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,415
<i>Empty? You're going blind! Blind!</i>

273
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,478
- Let's go.
- Let me go! He's blind!

274
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,085
Did she just curse me?

275
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,288
Tell all advertising agencies

276
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,150
she's not fit to be a model.

277
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,726
What's wrong with my eyes?

278
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,446
What's wrong?

279
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,348
I can't see, what's wrong with me?

280
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,823
What happened to my eyes?

281
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,295
Are you the

282
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,432
very famous photographer, Leslie Guan?

283
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,293
That's not me!

284
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,459
What's wrong, Doc?

285
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:19,538
It must be you!

286
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,608
It says you can make 1,000 bucks

287
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,540
with each click...

288
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,509
Tell me what happened to my sight!

289
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,474
It's not clear.

290
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,448
We have to run a series of tests.

291
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,611
Maybe just an infection...

292
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,551
- It's too early to say.
- Doc.

293
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,223
It's the end if he can't see.

294
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:38,517
Please help us!

295
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:41,287
Airport, please.

296
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,727
Oh! It's you again, madam.

297
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,334
You said you weren't leaving again.

298
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,729
This time, I won't ever come back!

299
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,301
Just give him a call.

300
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:57,511
Otherwise, you'll regret it.

301
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,375
Don't worry, I won't listen in, okay?

302
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,350
You promised to deliver the AC today.

303
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,380
Out of stock?

304
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,184
Hey,

305
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,054
I'm dying of the heat!

306
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:19,191
Hang up on me?

307
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,768
Ferrari racer

308
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,344
<i>What are you doing?</i>

309
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,186
<i>Test drive. Race tomorrow.</i>

310
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,534
Delicious! One more, please.

311
00:20:58,941 --> 00:20:59,930
Yes.

312
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,066
<i>I'm not available. Leave a message.</i>

313
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,278
Master Soy Sauce,

314
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,942
I've seen your new restaurant.

315
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,914
I'm happy for you. Congratulations!

316
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:20,550
<i>I saw your online rating. Taste, full score.</i>

317
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,999
<i>Hygiene, decoration, 100% Service...</i>

318
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:27,861
Only 1 point.

319
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,966
You know why?

320
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,804
<i>Because customers say that</i>

321
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,844
<i>the chef never smiles.</i>

322
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,841
I had always thought

323
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,848
that, if I tried harder,

324
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,681
I'd pry open the door that you kept shut.

325
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,017
<i>But...</i>

326
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:55,126
Now, I understand

327
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,462
only you could

328
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:02,359
open that door to me.

329
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:05,932
I'm leaving.

330
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,293
Wai, please take it.

331
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,966
It's pink. Hard to sell.

332
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't you accept anything secondhand?

333
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,339
Discriminating against pink?

334
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,500
No, it's just rare.

335
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:43,833
$400!

336
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,036
More, Wai, please!

337
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:47,738
No one will buy a pink AC for $400.

338
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,008
Just take it.

339
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:50,912
All right.

340
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:02,189
Hey, you...

341
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,381
Hey...

342
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,594
Hey, do you even know how to ride?

343
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,464
I'm talking to you!

344
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,565
Has the heat wave made you crazy?

345
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:16,896
Hold this for me.

346
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,693
I'm taking off. Here's your key.

347
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,002
298...

348
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:56,970
Pardon?

349
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:06,714
Swimming to the raft

350
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,485
takes 298 strokes.

351
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,653
Nuts!

352
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:23,897
You...

353
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,363
Waisun AC.

354
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,735
You've got the wrong tires.

355
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:29,701
Wanna race?

356
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,507
You think you can beat me?

357
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:32,737
What if I win?

358
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,643
Then you can ask for anything.

359
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,496
296, 297,

360
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,628
298...

361
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,400
Ding Dong, how many?

362
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:01,064
It takes 298 strokes to reach the raft.

363
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:03,105
I'm a good swimmer.

364
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,543
298 strokes, I can do it.

365
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,514
My mom always worries about sunburn,

366
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,585
so I've never been to any beach.

367
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:19,455
Will you take me when I'm better?

368
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:23,522
Sure, I'll buy you ice cream too, okay?

369
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:52,419
Fang, at least $10.

370
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,723
No more bargaining.

371
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,658
Just $2, take it or leave it.

372
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,792
Give me the money.

373
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:09,141
Go... Go!

374
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,846
25, 26, 27...

375
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:29,858
28!

376
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,864
Why are we here?

377
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,702
Remember, she cursed you,

378
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,207
and then you went blind.

379
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,504
Maybe...

380
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:45,939
Watch out.

381
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,313
Who are you looking for?

382
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,383
We're looking for Zhou Yuan Yuan.

383
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,381
Yuan Yuan? You are?

384
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,317
We're her relatives, very close ones.

385
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,116
Come in then.

386
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,986
She left in a hurry

387
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,722
without paying her rent.

388
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,656
Why don't you pay it for her? $500.

389
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,459
Give her $500.

390
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,199
Do you know where she went?

391
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,807
Heard she went to Shenzhen.

392
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,636
Can we check her room?

393
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,902
Sure, over there.

394
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:24,250
Now we helped her, maybe your eyes...

395
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,648
- Look.
- What?

396
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,520
Your magazine cover.

397
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,389
I've seen it. What is it?

398
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,492
- Feel it.
- Why?

399
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,393
- Get it?
- Get what?

400
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,227
- Get it?
- Holes!

401
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,197
What are the holes about?

402
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:44,099
Those were your eyes!

403
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:51,712
Can we swim to Shaolin Temple
from here?

404
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,675
Get off!

405
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,578
I'm considering becoming a monkfish.

406
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,378
She hasn't shown up since,

407
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,453
I'm afraid...

408
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:06,861
What's the most perfect meal you had?

409
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,394
Ying's beef fried rice. So perfect!

410
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:11,531
Hmm. What about you?

411
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,360
Double cheeseburger.

412
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:14,866
My mom would only buy me one

413
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,128
if I got straight As.

414
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,106
No wonder you're just my apprentice!

415
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,399
Master Chef,

416
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,638
still dreaming up your perfect meal?

417
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,809
She hasn't answered her phone since.

418
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,277
I think she's avoiding you.

419
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:28,507
In 2 weeks,

420
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,275
I'll prepare the perfect meal here.

421
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,817
Post invitations all over the internet!

422
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,112
She'll see it!

423
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:35,714
What if she doesn't?

424
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,914
Then we would have wasted our time!

425
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:40,219
Leave now if you don't want to help.

426
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,455
All right, I quit then.

427
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:44,255
Wait.

428
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,629
When she came to you, you ignored her.

429
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:49,895
You deserve it.

430
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,009
Seems the restaurant is not busy today,

431
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,151
so many calls.

432
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:14,788
Three calls already!

433
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:17,993
Now you start to care about me.

434
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,938
I have a poetry recital this afternoon,

435
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,139
will you come?

436
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,681
I'm going out to look for a job.

437
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,446
Again?

438
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:42,216
Storyberry, daddy needs to make money.

439
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:48,528
For the 100th time, it's Strawberry!

440
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,061
There's soy milk and rice in the fridge.

441
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,632
Microwave for 30 seconds only,

442
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,166
or it will dry up again.

443
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,835
I know.

444
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,234
Daddy, I've told you 100 times,

445
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,310
I won't play again.

446
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,556
What're you doing?

447
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,433
Are you playing the piano or massaging?

448
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,497
I'm really sorry.

449
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,638
Are you okay?

450
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,911
- I'm fine.
- Your face is burning red!

451
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:21,912
I'm okay.

452
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:23,549
Sure?

453
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:25,784
Good...

454
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,052
Just a second.

455
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,993
I've got to go.

456
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:38,163
Just a minute, one moment...

457
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,799
Are you sure you're all right?

458
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,107
Stop standing there if it's too hot!

459
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:46,137
No!

460
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,106
I won't give up. There are...

461
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:50,409
53 more days.

462
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:54,646
You counted?

463
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:57,916
Yes.

464
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,166
What're you doing tonight?

465
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,705
Wanna go for a drink?

466
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,638
Speak Cantonese. I can understand.

467
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,443
Your Cantonese has improved.

468
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,775
Let's go! So...

469
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,812
Are you hitting on me?

470
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:32,390
I like tattoos. You like to be tattooed.

471
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:34,153
We're made for each other.

472
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,391
<i>Bull!</i>

473
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,335
How come you're so rude?

474
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,341
It's the 8th year.

475
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,211
You've been coming here for 8 years.

476
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:00,886
Why get a tattoo of a ring every year?

477
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:05,182
<i>I'll tell you when I see you next year.</i>

478
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,020
You said the same thing last year.

479
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,424
So are we still going out?

480
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:16,328
<i>Thank you! Bye!</i>

481
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,596
Hey!

482
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:22,939
Super cold drinks and germ-proof straws.

483
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:26,907
Free drinks for all...

484
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:35,913
Free drinks! Welcome!

485
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,753
Welcome. Come.

486
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:42,590
My friends, cold drinks.

487
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,598
Welcome. Try...

488
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,635
Fang, I'll stand in for just $1 today.

489
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,798
No thanks.

490
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:59,410
Well, how about 50 cents then?

491
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,330
<i>Today's temperature hits a new record.</i>

492
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:24,164
<i>The outdoor temperature is 48 °C now.</i>

493
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,499
<i>Ice cream is now a prized commodity.</i>

494
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,869
<i>You can't buy it even if you're rich!</i>

495
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,742
$70, anyone?

496
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:32,971
- $75.
- $80!

497
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,816
- $85.
- $100.

498
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,442
$200.

499
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,645
$200, once.

500
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,447
$200, twice.

501
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,416
Deal!

502
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,689
<i>We're used to standing in line for food.</i>

503
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:49,960
<i>Now we need to queue up</i>

504
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:51,758
<i>to get space on the beach.</i>

505
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:53,924
Plot 795 for 3 people, going once...

506
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:55,797
3 people, twice...

507
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,129
Here!

508
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,644
Getting bigger!

509
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:09,114
- I'm training every day!
- So firm!

510
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:10,709
Sweetheart,

511
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,614
I'll tell you a joke.

512
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,618
Another old joke, old man?

513
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,780
What's the difference between

514
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,118
jumping from the 2nd floor

515
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:19,384
and the 20th floor?

516
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,019
- I don't know...
- No, I don't know.

517
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:23,493
When a man falls from the 2nd floor...

518
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,655
<i>Bang... Aiya!</i>

519
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,464
When a man falls from the 20th floor...

520
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,332
<i>Ai... Ya... Bang!</i>

521
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,638
Gas tank, horsepower, shock absorbers.

522
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,377
Everything must be the best.

523
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:46,883
Why don't you just get a new bike?

524
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:48,612
No way!

525
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,015
I want to be the fastest in Hong Kong.

526
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,317
It'll cost you five figures!

527
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,157
<i>That expensive?</i>

528
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,662
You repair ACs, right?

529
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,937
The weather's so hot. Advertise online.

530
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,834
It's easy to raise enough money!

531
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,414
Latest bid: $1,000, $1,100...

532
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,798
Hi, Mr. Chan. Waisun AC.

533
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,225
Right.

534
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:39,295
$1,600? My fee is now...

535
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,235
$1,700.

536
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:45,772
Confirmed. I'll be right there.

537
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:47,905
Thank you.

538
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,210
<i>Crisis creates opportunity.</i>

539
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:53,546
<i>The hot weather
has made some people rich.</i>

540
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,882
<i>Next to me is Wai, who fixes ACs.</i>

541
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,388
<i>He's one of the lucky ones.</i>

542
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,253
<i>What gave you the idea</i>

543
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,088
<i>to auction your services online?</i>

544
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,422
<i>I needed to raise some money,</i>

545
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,426
<i>so if you need to fix your AC,</i>

546
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:06,825
<i>you can come to Waisun.</i>

547
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,768
<i>You really understand marketing.</i>

548
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:12,667
<i>Where did you learn your trade?</i>

549
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,801
<i>I studied in jail.</i>

550
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:17,237
<i>You were in jail?</i>

551
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,946
<i>Why? Do you mind telling us?</i>

552
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,345
<i>My dad ratted me out.</i>

553
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,449
<i>Brat!</i>

554
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,922
Your mother is spinning in her urn!

555
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,458
If I win, I can ask for anything?

556
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,297
We'll see!

557
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:46,565
Let's race then!

558
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,903
Sure.

559
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:30,108
It's so fast! It's really fast!

560
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,753
I had no idea it was so fast!

561
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,516
You've won. So what do you want?

562
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,358
Maybe the bike has the answer.

563
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,767
Let me know soon! There's a deadline.

564
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,200
"There's a deadline!"

565
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,308
Let's look for Yuan Yuan in Shenzhen.

566
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:08,380
I don't want to be blind for life.

567
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,450
Must find a cure by any means necessary.

568
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,555
Go get me a drink.

569
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,852
Okay.

570
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:25,230
What's that smell? Da Fu...

571
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:29,307
Fire! Fire! Run!

572
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,104
What's wrong?

573
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,273
Photo, my photo...

574
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:37,076
Which one? There are too many!

575
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,616
Just one, the one and only one.

576
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:40,117
Where is it? I will get it for you.

577
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,948
Wallet... In my wallet.

578
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,798
Free drinks for all!

579
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,832
Strawberry, that ice cube is cute!

580
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:01,099
Let's take a picture.

581
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,175
I want a snapshot.

582
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:06,607
- No, don't...
- Just one picture...

583
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:09,707
Strawberry!

584
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:11,742
Hey!

585
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,555
Why did you flee when you saw me today?

586
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,061
You were a walking ice cube!

587
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,425
Did I embarrass you?

588
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:30,127
How much money
do you make in one hour?

589
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,797
Why do you ask?

590
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:34,065
Tell me.

591
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,640
Do you look down on me?

592
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:36,934
No.

593
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:39,207
$50, okay?

594
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,375
Then can I borrow thirty bucks?

595
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:45,713
I thought you understood my situation,

596
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,585
but you only want money!

597
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,814
No.

598
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,649
I don't have it!

599
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,386
- Daddy.
- No!

600
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,518
Daddy!

601
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,154
Storyberry!

602
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,828
<i>Daddy, here's $50.</i>

603
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,466
<i>Can I buy one hour of your time?</i>

604
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,969
<i>Come to my poetry recital this afternoon.</i>

605
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:43,200
Hey.

606
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,772
Can you do me a favor?

607
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:50,479
My service is $1,700 an hour now.

608
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,278
Do you take credit card?

609
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,885
Cash only.

610
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,521
Please...

611
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:03,293
It's not a business if I only do favors.

612
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:05,159
Come on.

613
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:09,460
Go!

614
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,700
Go... Right now!

615
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,015
What do you want me for?

616
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,145
The old lady inside has a brain tumor.

617
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,344
She's dying.

618
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,317
She wants to see her son.

619
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,616
Pretend to be him.

620
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,150
- I...
- She can't see. It'll be fine.

621
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,827
Remember, your name is Ah Keung.

622
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:37,486
You just came back from the States.

623
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,995
<i>- But I'm not her son.
- Just hold her...</i>

624
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,158
Give her some final comfort, okay?

625
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,728
Will it work?

626
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:46,235
Keung, you can do it. Go...

627
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:48,502
Should I say something?

628
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:49,633
Auntie,

629
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:51,536
Keung is here.

630
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:55,543
Keung...

631
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,066
Tortoises!

632
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:27,275
What are their names?

633
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,343
Hey, why did you kiss me?

634
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:33,244
<i>Because you are so nice.</i>

635
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:35,979
I just want to help people.

636
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,919
Why? It has nothing to do with you.

637
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,757
I help them fulfill their final wishes.

638
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:47,296
The girl had never swam to a raft.

639
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,068
She wanted to know
how many strokes it needs to get there.

640
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:51,602
That's why you deserve a kiss.

641
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,382
Hello.

642
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,489
<i>We're calling from Shenzhen Orchestra.</i>

643
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,461
<i>We received your resume earlier.</i>

644
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,524
<i>You can come for an audition tomorrow.</i>

645
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:26,301
I'll definitely be there. Thank you!

646
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:33,478
Finally!

647
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,382
I'm so dead...

648
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:43,114
Sorry...

649
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,502
Sorry.

650
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:44,910
Take it slow.

651
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,680
Welcome.

652
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:52,116
<i>How was your performance?</i>

653
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:04,696
<i>It was awful.</i>

654
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,963
Don't push...

655
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,805
<i>You told me that Mozart was an optimist</i>

656
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,615
<i>even though he had a harsh life.</i>

657
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:18,842
<i>Just a small setback,</i>

658
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,953
<i>you'll overcome it. Break a leg!</i>

659
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:40,298
If it's sushi, it'll go with soy sauce.

660
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:49,516
Half past three!

661
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,748
Hurry up... Just one more!

662
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:05,729
I've been there, now it's your turn.

663
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:07,560
Is Wasabi there?

664
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:10,197
<i>You are the Hong Kong man!</i>

665
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:12,872
<i>What kind of drug</i>

666
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,701
<i>did you put in my daughter's sushi?</i>

667
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:15,799
<i>Uncle...</i>

668
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:18,736
Is she in Taiwan?

669
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:22,214
<i>Idiot. She's still in Hong Kong.</i>

670
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,081
<i>You suddenly care about her?</i>

671
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:26,913
<i>Learn to love or be a loser forever.</i>

672
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,178
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

673
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:29,550
Sorry. I can't do that.

674
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:31,918
<i>Look at you. So uptight.</i>

675
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,098
Is Leslie Guan in Shenzhen?

676
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:41,729
This model is very ordinary,

677
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,267
she's even less than ordinary.

678
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,562
I have much better ones!

679
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:45,795
Ordinary?

680
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:46,997
Yes.

681
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:48,939
Take another look.

682
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:50,370
Is this ordinary?

683
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:51,869
Very ordinary!

684
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,103
You know nothing.

685
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:58,381
This is the first photo I ever took.

686
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,715
Your girlfriend?

687
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:04,882
She's the one who hurt me the most.

688
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,656
Do you know where she is now?

689
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,922
She lives in Suzhou.

690
00:49:12,232 --> 00:49:13,893
Divorced.

691
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:15,125
Wait a sec...

692
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,432
I remember she came looking for you.

693
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:20,235
You told me to lie, say you were out.

694
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:22,068
She left me.

695
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,771
I don't want to see her again.

696
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:27,112
When she left, she was in tears.

697
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,207
Why didn't you give her a chance?

698
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,023
<i>It's expensive. Never mind, let's go.</i>

699
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:46,088
Wait. You're standing all the time.

700
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:48,598
It's totally worth it.

701
00:49:49,336 --> 00:49:50,462
Two people, please.

702
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:52,730
Really?

703
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:54,774
Trust me.

704
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,108
You SMS her all this time.

705
00:49:57,277 --> 00:49:59,302
We're in Shenzhen. Why not ask her out?

706
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:00,537
See if she's pretty.

707
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:01,806
Crazy.

708
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:05,178
Look at me. I'm a nobody.

709
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:06,444
I can't meet her...

710
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,183
Welcome!

711
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:18,731
She looks good. Let's swap.

712
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:21,793
Hey, miss.

713
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:24,361
He likes you. Why not serve him instead?

714
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,662
Yes.

715
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:32,172
Your legs are really stiff and swollen.

716
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:34,578
I was a driver,

717
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:37,578
then worked in construction,

718
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:39,979
and now...

719
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,215
I need to stand all day long!

720
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,388
Just like a coolie.

721
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:49,926
Odd jobs.

722
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:53,064
It will be okay, I'll press harder.

723
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:02,099
Your technique is unique. What is it?

724
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:03,668
Self-taught.

725
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:04,936
Piles.

726
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:08,441
Not piles. It's self-taught.

727
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:10,208
It feels good...

728
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,376
So good.

729
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:13,578
Sir, how do I address you?

730
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,420
Just call me Coolie.

731
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:18,749
Mr. Coolie.

732
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:20,418
What about you?

733
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,357
I'm No. 98.

734
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,095
<i>Ask for me next time you come.</i>

735
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,756
Definitely 88.

736
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:29,634
No, it's 98.

737
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:32,026
Nine...

738
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:44,447
Your cell phone, it's beeping.

739
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:47,313
I can't use my phone during work hours.

740
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,792
Go see the boss after work.

741
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:02,859
Come in.

742
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:07,570
Sit down, please.

743
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:10,772
<i>Boss, you wanted to see me?</i>

744
00:52:11,478 --> 00:52:12,570
Mom, don't worry,

745
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:14,977
I'll send you some money tomorrow.

746
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:18,113
Why do you ask about my boss?

747
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:21,148
<i>Yes, he's interested in me. But...</i>

748
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:25,352
I understand.

749
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:30,761
I'll give you a better life.

750
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:52,277
<i>Do you know the story behind</i>

751
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:53,510
<i>Mozart's No. 545?</i>

752
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:01,154
<i>You have a real interest in him.</i>

753
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:06,359
<i>That's because of my daughter.</i>

754
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:10,066
Married? What do you think I am?

755
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,969
A mistress?

756
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,474
<i>How's married life? Happy?</i>

757
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:23,081
<i>She ran away with someone last year.</i>

758
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:25,844
Fantastic!

759
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:31,715
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

760
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:37,591
<i>My daughter used to love playing piano.</i>

761
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:39,057
<i>She's got real talent.</i>

762
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:41,261
<i>But since her mom left,</i>

763
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:43,229
<i>she stopped playing.</i>

764
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:49,538
This light bulb is discontinued.

765
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,111
I have to get one

766
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:55,509
before my wife's death anniversary.

767
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:56,842
Please help.

768
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:58,846
Try another kind.

769
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,344
Impossible,

770
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,684
once she got used to something.

771
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,551
She hated changes.

772
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:06,617
This light bulb

773
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:09,391
has been with her for over ten years.

774
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,466
Try your luck across the harbor.

775
00:54:17,938 --> 00:54:19,997
<i>Boss, one more set please.</i>

776
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,841
Wai, you've become a celebrity.

777
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:24,769
Give me a discount then.

778
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:26,706
Let me see if we have it in stock.

779
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,814
I don't have it.

780
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:30,540
Sold out!

781
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:34,545
Thanks.

782
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,786
You're lucky. It's the very last one.

783
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:51,729
Thank you.

784
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,568
<i>Ungrateful brat,</i>

785
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:00,172
you don't even greet your own father?

786
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,706
Father?

787
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,810
My father ratted me out to the cops!

788
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:06,646
If not for me, you'd be dead already!

789
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:09,748
Selling fake goods,

790
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,849
loan sharking, getting into fights!

791
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,425
You'll get yourself killed!

792
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:16,687
Then just consider me dead!

793
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:17,821
You brat!

794
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:47,019
This is from the boss.

795
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:50,094
It's your birthday. He'll buy you dinner.

796
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:51,896
Give it back to him.

797
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,625
Take it.

798
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:01,931
That boy is only fooling with you.

799
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,300
Don't be so serious.

800
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,743
Enjoy your meal.

801
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:10,441
Happy birthday.

802
00:56:11,184 --> 00:56:12,310
Let's go.

803
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,411
Xiao Qi?

804
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,964
Go to hell!

805
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:52,619
It looks almost real...

806
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,420
<i>But...</i>

807
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,227
<i>But...</i>

808
00:56:58,298 --> 00:56:59,356
<i>But what?</i>

809
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,263
It's still just a bike.

810
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,365
What's wrong with a bike?

811
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:12,244
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

812
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:14,846
<i>Happy birthday to Daddy.</i>

813
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,612
<i>Happy birthday to me!</i>

814
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,281
Do you want to know my wish?

815
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:26,357
It won't come true if you tell me.

816
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:31,187
I wish to hear you play piano again.

817
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,495
I've told you that I won't play again.

818
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,695
Why? You are really good at it.

819
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,394
I don't want to play.

820
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:40,662
Come on, listen to daddy just once.

821
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,898
You enjoyed it so much.

822
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,201
I don't like it.

823
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:50,814
Why did you give up?

824
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:52,710
I just don't want to play.

825
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:56,720
Your mom's gone.

826
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:01,816
I don't want to listen!

827
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,760
She won't come back again.

828
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,158
I don't want to listen!

829
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:18,870
- And then?
- Nothing, that's it.

830
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:21,038
<i>Uncle Fai, any jokes today?</i>

831
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:24,045
Today's jokes are not funny.

832
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:28,011
Can I have two of these? Thanks!

833
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,779
No more.

834
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:32,288
An old man bought the last one.

835
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,857
He said he must get the light bulb

836
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:37,053
before his wife's death anniversary.

837
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:39,857
Please.

838
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,726
Call me if you find one.

839
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,027
This is my number.

840
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,036
Let's celebrate.

841
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,741
Celebrate what?

842
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:51,638
I learned to face reality today.

843
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,106
Didn't we need to find her first?

844
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,280
Two weeks ago,

845
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,542
the doctor told me

846
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,747
there's a tumor near my optic nerve.

847
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,285
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

848
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:07,818
We needn't stay here for her.

849
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,455
I wanted to make it up to her.

850
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:12,756
We've tried our best.

851
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,661
<i>Let's head back to Beijing tomorrow.</i>

852
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:31,810
Pianist?

853
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,418
<i>Is your daughter playing again?</i>

854
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,815
<i>Don't let her give up.</i>

855
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:43,825
<i>You once asked why I liked playing piano.</i>

856
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,126
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

857
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:49,625
<i>Mozart and I share the same birthday.</i>

858
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:53,303
<i>I haven't heard from you, are you okay?</i>

859
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:56,201
<i>Don't blame yourself.</i>

860
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,707
<i>You didn't fail your daughter.</i>

861
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,018
Sorry, daddy. Did I wake you up?

862
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,512
No.

863
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:44,353
I don't mind a piano wake-up call.

864
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:53,431
I'm a fish, I'm not afraid of the heat.

865
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:01,904
<i>What do you want the most right now?</i>

866
01:01:06,713 --> 01:01:09,273
<i>An AC.</i>

867
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:13,778
<i>I'll get you one.</i>

868
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,347
<i>Why?</i>

869
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,556
<i>My daughter's playing piano again!</i>

870
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:25,061
His daughter is playing again!

871
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:32,035
<i>My daughter wants to see you perform.</i>

872
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:33,866
<i>Can we come and visit?</i>

873
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:49,216
<i>Excuse me. I want to buy a hose.</i>

874
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:52,615
A hose.

875
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:56,953
$5.

876
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:00,225
You have anything longer?

877
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,063
Longer?

878
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:05,329
$10.

879
01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:07,600
<i>$10? Too expensive.</i>

880
01:02:07,774 --> 01:02:09,435
How much is this AC?

881
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:13,269
It's a classic...

882
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:17,245
Pink, very rare, $450.

883
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:19,248
$450! Cheaper?

884
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:20,477
Any discount?

885
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:21,979
<i>But it's pink.</i>

886
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,289
Good stuff, durable. Are you

887
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,617
discriminating against pink?

888
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:28,454
- I'm in a hurry.
- Just a moment.

889
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,095
Look, here's all I have.

890
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,924
Let me keep $20.

891
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:36,093
It's a deal!

892
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,960
Will it work on the mainland?

893
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,867
I thought they still used fans.

894
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,200
How long have you been away?

895
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,501
It's all ACs now!

896
01:02:45,445 --> 01:02:46,503
It's none of your business!

897
01:02:47,046 --> 01:02:48,172
Take a plug, free of charge.

898
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:50,277
- Thank you.
- No, I don't want it.

899
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:55,019
Fussing over a few bucks, big shot?

900
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,947
Sorry about that, boss.

901
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,950
<i>- Be careful, it's rare.
- Thank you.</i>

902
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,556
I'll sell more pink stuff from now on.

903
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:11,228
Stop!

904
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:18,037
Sorry!

905
01:03:18,244 --> 01:03:19,905
Stop!

906
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:32,249
Wai.

907
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,687
Your pants are torn. Any plan tonight?

908
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:39,354
I come here just to thank.

909
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,363
No more pretending to be someone else.

910
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,695
Get going.

911
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,938
Are you okay?

912
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:07,184
It's here.

913
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:15,028
You're sick. Why didn't you tell me?

914
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:17,965
How much time
does the doctor say I have?

915
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,235
I've been sick for 8 years.

916
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,747
I'm well prepared.

917
01:04:33,986 --> 01:04:35,146
I'm not.

918
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:42,756
Don't worry.

919
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,192
What do you want me to say?

920
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,038
I don't care about anything.

921
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:02,501
I only care about loving you.

922
01:06:02,808 --> 01:06:05,072
All I want is that
you will always be there to hug me.

923
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:08,136
You'll eat breakfast with me.

924
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:10,277
Walk on the beach with me.

925
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,408
Just that simple. Can you do that?

926
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:17,751
You only care about yourself.

927
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:19,049
Have you ever thought about me?

928
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:23,823
I don't know what you want.

929
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,258
I've said enough already.

930
01:06:27,366 --> 01:06:30,597
Call me when you figure it out.

931
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:40,236
Some hot tea.

932
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:45,911
Thank you.

933
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:02,695
Can I smoke?

934
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,597
Sorry, you can't smoke here.

935
01:07:14,246 --> 01:07:15,440
There's no one here.

936
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,781
Let me smoke.

937
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,077
It's a matter of principle.

938
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:22,884
<i>Principle? But you're closed already.</i>

939
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:24,750
I should get going then. Sorry.

940
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:26,983
No hurry. Take your time.

941
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:29,123
I'll be all right in a moment.

942
01:07:39,672 --> 01:07:41,572
Actually, the food is very good here.

943
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,273
Where did you study?

944
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:49,778
Tokyo. Ginza.

945
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,912
My master was Mr. Maeda.

946
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,650
I've trained under him for 8 years.

947
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:57,786
Suddenly, one day,

948
01:07:57,957 --> 01:07:59,652
he cooked me a bowl of hot noodles.

949
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,817
After I finished, he asked me to go home

950
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,456
to promote his way of cooking.

951
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:07,326
A bowl of hot noodles again...

952
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,866
When I was in Tokyo,

953
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:15,606
I ate at a stall in the red light area.

954
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,273
I met a couple.

955
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,041
They were very sweet.

956
01:08:22,648 --> 01:08:25,640
They looked just ordinary.

957
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:29,383
<i>But I noticed that under the table,</i>

958
01:08:29,889 --> 01:08:33,222
they held hands, never letting go.

959
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:36,959
They looked at each other so fondly.

960
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:43,065
When the chef set the noodles down,

961
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,166
the boy prepared

962
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:48,665
a pair of chopsticks for the girl.

963
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:51,036
He even fed her.

964
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,905
I was really touched

965
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:54,905
because I felt that,

966
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,413
even though they shared a single bowl,

967
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,545
they were really happy.

968
01:09:01,921 --> 01:09:03,718
That is love. Very simple.

969
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,356
Yes, it should be simple.

970
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,712
The Perfect Meal

971
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:45,821
Xiao Li.

972
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:48,757
Please tell the boss

973
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:50,859
that I cannot accept his gift.

974
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:59,707
You should meet her if you miss her!

975
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:04,580
Mind your own business, kiddo.

976
01:10:12,558 --> 01:10:14,822
Where's the pianist?

977
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,487
Hello.

978
01:10:18,564 --> 01:10:20,623
<i>This is Strawberry.</i>

979
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,732
My dad bought a really beautiful AC.

980
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:29,841
He really wants to give it to you.

981
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:32,441
<i>Can you please see him? Just once.</i>

982
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:38,445
Storyberry!

983
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:40,915
<i>Daddy, tomorrow at 3 o'clock.</i>

984
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:42,982
<i>I've arranged a date for you.</i>

985
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,615
Really?

986
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,189
Tomorrow? Oh, no!

987
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:57,795
Is this the truffle you're looking for?

988
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:00,663
Right, thank you.

989
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,307
Wasabi? We have fresh wasabi.

990
01:11:03,642 --> 01:11:05,610
That's not what I want.

991
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:13,484
How come he hasn't called?

992
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:17,522
<i>Hello, Anxin Bank.
Would you'd like a loan?</i>

993
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,782
A loan? Idiot!

994
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,189
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>

995
01:11:34,473 --> 01:11:36,304
Do I look good?

996
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:38,670
Daddy, you're really

997
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:40,977
handsome!

998
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:45,143
Go. Women don't like men to be late!

999
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:46,341
Really?

1000
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,999
<i>I am here, where are you?</i>

1001
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,539
Wah.

1002
01:12:21,487 --> 01:12:23,478
- Coolie?
- No. 98?

1003
01:12:23,555 --> 01:12:24,613
You...

1004
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:38,128
Pianist.

1005
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:39,628
Ferrari...

1006
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,601
Liar!

1007
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:47,405
You too!

1008
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:52,482
<i>Hong Kong people are very romantic.</i>

1009
01:12:52,718 --> 01:12:55,312
<i>This restaurant makes the perfect meal</i>

1010
01:12:55,554 --> 01:12:57,545
<i>for a special guest.</i>

1011
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,648
<i>It's an inspiring idea.</i>

1012
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:07,958
<i>Da Fu, you go back to Beijing.</i>

1013
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,162
I'll go to Suzhou.

1014
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:12,332
To Suzhou, to look for her?

1015
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,569
I want to see her before my operation.

1016
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:16,833
I'll go with you.

1017
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:18,566
No, I need to be alone.

1018
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:20,405
Okay, I will wait in Shenzhen for you.

1019
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,276
You always want to be

1020
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:27,180
a great photographer.

1021
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:31,616
I want to tell you something.

1022
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:34,851
Lighting, make-up, costumes

1023
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:37,790
are not that important.

1024
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,455
Through their eyes,

1025
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:43,692
<i>you must capture their joy, excitement,</i>

1026
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:45,697
their loneliness, their sorrow,

1027
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:47,830
their very soul!

1028
01:13:52,644 --> 01:13:53,668
Hey.

1029
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,441
You found Zhou Yuan Yuan?

1030
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:01,618
What's up?

1031
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,549
I am sorry, Dad.
Wai.

1032
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:12,556
<i>Brat.</i>

1033
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:23,905
Do you remember that I still owe you?

1034
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:30,207
You won the race last time.

1035
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:33,976
I promised you could ask for anything.

1036
01:14:36,655 --> 01:14:38,316
I'll tell you when you get better.

1037
01:14:39,358 --> 01:14:40,416
No!

1038
01:14:46,098 --> 01:14:47,861
I want to know now.

1039
01:14:53,605 --> 01:14:54,697
You've been helping others,

1040
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:57,703
so my wish is to help you.

1041
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,336
Take down the sign. She won't come.

1042
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:32,070
Let's clean up and go home.

1043
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:38,743
We're not open tonight.

1044
01:15:39,484 --> 01:15:41,145
Just one, may I?

1045
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,188
Wasabi? Master, Wasabi!

1046
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:47,688
You know where the wasabi is. You get it.

1047
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,588
It's your Wasabi, Master Chef.

1048
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:00,594
I'm a bit hungry.

1049
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:02,569
Are you still open?

1050
01:16:07,412 --> 01:16:09,380
These aren't your usual ingredients.

1051
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:12,011
Eat from left to right, please.

1052
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:19,014
Hope she likes it.

1053
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:36,002
Oh! No! She spat it out.

1054
01:16:37,743 --> 01:16:39,677
Well, it is not that bad,

1055
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,675
but this is not your style.

1056
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,815
To be original is always best.

1057
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:49,681
Why all this fusion food?

1058
01:16:51,456 --> 01:16:53,185
The recipes you sent me,

1059
01:16:54,326 --> 01:16:56,021
I read all of them.

1060
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:58,092
Didn't you say you had thrown them out?

1061
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,995
I just didn't want to return them.

1062
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,169
You know what?

1063
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,535
This is the worst meal you've made.

1064
01:17:17,783 --> 01:17:20,479
It's also the most touching meal ever.

1065
01:17:24,823 --> 01:17:26,450
Good job in your disguise.

1066
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,286
Especially that Ferrari cap.

1067
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:31,522
The cap is real!

1068
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,395
I didn't lie to you.

1069
01:17:33,965 --> 01:17:35,626
I'm really a driver.

1070
01:17:35,801 --> 01:17:37,632
It's just that I don't drive a Ferrari.

1071
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,534
I'm in fact a pianist too.

1072
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:43,570
It's just... I've never been to Vienna.

1073
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:48,404
Then why don't you play again?

1074
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,706
With these?

1075
01:17:56,722 --> 01:17:59,020
If it's really her, we'll look backstage.

1076
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,149
Okay.

1077
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:01,317
Tickets, gentlemen.

1078
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:02,551
Yes, sure.

1079
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:12,829
Master, over there!

1080
01:18:13,338 --> 01:18:14,430
Zhou Yuan Yuan!

1081
01:18:14,706 --> 01:18:15,764
Is she the star?

1082
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,603
No photo.

1083
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:20,269
Is she the lead?

1084
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:21,603
Da Fu.

1085
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:23,405
Is she?

1086
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:24,844
<i>I can't even tell if she's an extra!</i>

1087
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:34,249
Teacher, hailstorm!

1088
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:37,084
Hailstorm... Hailstorm!

1089
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:55,744
Are you all right?

1090
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:57,575
- I'm okay.
- Come this way.

1091
01:19:04,022 --> 01:19:05,046
Zhou Yuan Yuan!

1092
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:07,419
We've been trying so hard to find you.

1093
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:10,619
Sorry.

1094
01:19:11,396 --> 01:19:13,830
This is not the perfect meal.

1095
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,592
<i>But I am moved...</i>

1096
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:18,467
That means it's perfect!

1097
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:22,697
You...

1098
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:25,136
Can you stay?

1099
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,110
Looking for me?

1100
01:19:34,586 --> 01:19:36,144
Wanna see how pitiful I am?

1101
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,915
<i>Sorry. Because of what I said.</i>

1102
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,955
I ruined your career.

1103
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:42,184
I'm terribly sorry.

1104
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:44,796
Can I invite you

1105
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:46,362
to be my student's model?

1106
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:47,690
Let him take some photos of you?

1107
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,527
- Teacher.
- You can do it!

1108
01:19:49,935 --> 01:19:51,664
It's just like you said about my eyes.

1109
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,937
I'm almost blind. I can't take photos.

1110
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:55,834
My teacher is telling the truth!

1111
01:19:57,809 --> 01:19:59,504
We wouldn't come all the way

1112
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:02,408
<i>from Beijing to lie to you.</i>

1113
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:08,541
Sorry.

1114
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,678
You can trust him.

1115
01:20:09,855 --> 01:20:10,947
He will capture

1116
01:20:11,122 --> 01:20:13,181
the beauty inside of you,

1117
01:20:13,358 --> 01:20:16,054
that one important moment.

1118
01:20:16,528 --> 01:20:17,654
Please?

1119
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,661
You're bleeding.

1120
01:20:37,215 --> 01:20:38,375
It's ready.

1121
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:39,742
You want to turn it on?

1122
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:42,180
- Me?
- Yes, do the honor.

1123
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:52,192
At last, I have my own AC!

1124
01:20:52,664 --> 01:20:54,427
It really works!

1125
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:56,362
And it's pink too!

1126
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:01,671
It stopped.

1127
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:09,842
So cool...

1128
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,351
I didn't see the ad.

1129
01:21:17,756 --> 01:21:18,882
Then why did you come?

1130
01:21:19,524 --> 01:21:21,253
<i>Because Wasabi and Soy Sauce</i>

1131
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:23,354
are meant to be together.

1132
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,697
Today is the 100th day, go take a look!

1133
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,302
What's wrong?

1134
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:45,741
He didn't come.

1135
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:58,459
Where is Xiao Fang? Where is he?

1136
01:21:58,897 --> 01:22:01,195
He said he wanted to see the big world.

1137
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:04,431
He's gone?

1138
01:22:04,603 --> 01:22:05,763
He just left for the train station.

1139
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:15,777
Why don't you continue?

1140
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:18,746
Who am I? You think that I deserve her?

1141
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:24,516
I'll go out into the world

1142
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,854
and make some good money.

1143
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,129
She'll be married by then.

1144
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:33,958
Then I'll win her back.

1145
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:35,793
Silly boy!

1146
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,002
Take it.

1147
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:42,563
I lost.

1148
01:22:42,641 --> 01:22:43,630
Not yet!

1149
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,505
Shanghai, economy class.

1150
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,461
Xiao Fang!

1151
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:11,894
Xiao Fang!

1152
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:17,430
Xiao Fang!

1153
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:18,801
<i>The train is leaving soon.</i>

1154
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:20,342
<i>Please board the train...</i>

1155
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,906
Xiao Fang! Where are you?

1156
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:28,350
Do you love me?

1157
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:33,089
Can you tell me

1158
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:38,220
why on the 100th day did you give up?

1159
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:43,394
Tell me.
Why did you quit on the last day?

1160
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:51,767
Where are you?

1161
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:07,622
Xiao Fang!

1162
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:21,963
Come...

1163
01:24:22,574 --> 01:24:23,563
Where to?

1164
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,767
Let's go.

1165
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:34,977
<i>You've been helping others.</i>

1166
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:37,448
<i>It's my turn to help you.</i>

1167
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:41,823
<i>I always want to ride my bike forever</i>

1168
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:45,820
<i>without stopping for anything</i>

1169
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:50,734
<i>until the end of the world.</i>

1170
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:04,906
It's cool.

1171
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,441
They're really going to kiss!

1172
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,845
Honey, our son is not that bad after all.

1173
01:25:14,826 --> 01:25:17,420
What's happening?

1174
01:25:19,164 --> 01:25:20,256
What's wrong?

1175
01:25:21,132 --> 01:25:22,827
I think I've used the wrong plug.

1176
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:28,470
How come it's so dark?

1177
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,631
No way! Lost my chance again?

1178
01:25:39,317 --> 01:25:40,443
<i>Remember</i>

1179
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,183
<i>you asked me once if I have any dreams?</i>

1180
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,281
My dream is to drive a Ferrari,

1181
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,793
<i>listening to Mozart with you next to me.</i>

1182
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:54,153
Now...

1183
01:25:55,533 --> 01:25:57,467
My dream can come true.

1184
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:02,697
Just a moment.

1185
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:04,466
I need to fasten my seatbelt.

1186
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:09,970
<i>But, there's no Mozart.</i>

1187
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,209
There is.

1188
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:21,150
I can hear the music you play,

1189
01:26:21,893 --> 01:26:23,690
it's Mozart.

1190
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:40,077
Honey, I've made up with our son.

1191
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:40,560
<i>Wai, when I hold you,
I can feel your heart.</i>

1192
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,066
<i>Thank you.</i>

1193
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:47,444
<i>I was so lucky to have met you.</i>

1194
01:27:50,081 --> 01:27:52,606
<i>If you remember me, remember me now.</i>

1195
01:28:13,438 --> 01:28:15,702
Look over here... Very good...

1196
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:18,032
It's perfect...

1197
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:22,001
Perfect.

1198
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:29,286
Sorry, I took up so much of your time.

1199
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,612
It's okay.

1200
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:32,955
Shall we go for breakfast?

1201
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,516
Sure!

1202
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,319
It's 6 in the morning already.

1203
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:39,291
Your watch is really cool.

1204
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,959
My dad gave it to me.

1205
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:44,465
20 years ago, my dad bet with his boss.

1206
01:28:44,702 --> 01:28:47,193
He had to stand under the blazing sun

1207
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,563
for 100 days!

1208
01:29:07,892 --> 01:29:09,655
<i>My dad told me</i>

1209
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:13,159
<i>100 days represent persistence and hope.</i>

1210
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,511
<i>Xiao Fang, you came back to me!</i>
