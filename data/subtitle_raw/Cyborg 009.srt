00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:24,920
Cyborg
Presented by BlueFixer  Subs

2
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,120
Who will take the world racing championship?

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,580
Japan or America? The USSR or England?

4
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,750
It's an incredible race!

5
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, it's Japan's Shimamura Joe!

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,510
He's pulling ahead of the pack.

7
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,770
His entire body is like one big mass of reflexes.

8
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,350
The fearless racer, Joe the Hurricane. Will he take the victory?!

9
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,070
Many years have passed since the terrible war.

10
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,740
An automobile race amongst peaceful nations.

11
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,330
Today, standing at the top once again, is Shimamura Joe.

12
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,620
However, on the other end of the course he races down...

13
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,080
A dreadful fate awaits him, one which will pull the world into darkness once more.

14
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,680
The victim? Where is the victim?

15
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
Then, that ambulance just now was a fake?!

16
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,900
Heheheheheheh... That went well.

17
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,700
The ambulance is a fake.

18
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,110
Arrest them immediately!

19
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,080
Hey, they're coming after us.

20
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Hmph, don't worry about it.

21
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,970
We've brought Shimamura Joe's corpse.

22
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,880
I see.

23
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,220
I wish I could commend you for your good work, but you two made an unforgivable mistake.

24
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,100
The knife you left at the scene of the crime.

25
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,350
The Black Ghost Organisation demands perfection in all its work!

26
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,530
Mistakes will not be forgiven.

27
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,990
You called?

28
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,120
Bring Professor Gilmore to the surgery room and have him begin work on Shimamura Joe.

29
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,710
Alright, let's begin.

30
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,750
Scalpel.

31
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,810
Good.

32
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,430
Artificial heart.

33
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,600
Respiraton machine.

34
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,990
Joe! Open your eyes!

35
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,410
Open your eyes!

36
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,710
Huh?

37
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,630
Where in the world am I?

38
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,340
Just what am I doing here?

39
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,050
Ah! What are these clothes?

40
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,590
We'll start the test now.

41
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,680
Test?

42
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,800
What are you talking about?

43
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
I can't believe it!

44
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,580
Even after being crushed under all that concrete, I'm still perfectly fine!

45
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,680
I can run incredibly fast!

46
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,740
Hey, I'm alright!

47
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,610
Those bullets definitely hit me, but they didn't do a thing!

48
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,580
Okay!

49
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,010
Dammit!

50
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,530
Huh? I'm underwater but I can breathe easily!

51
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,870
Ahh... That was awful.

52
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,210
But I'm not tired at all.

53
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,130
Okay! It's a success!

54
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,800
Who? Who are you people?

55
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,430
The test is over.

56
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,720
You are the greatest cyborg we have ever created.

57
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,430
A test? Cyborgs?

58
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,940
That's right! You received an operation to make you into a cyborg!

59
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,440
A living being turned into something greater than it could ever be naturally by using the power of science.

60
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,650
That is a cyborg.

61
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,070
Your brain has had an artificial brain implanted in it making it many times better than it was before.

62
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,700
And for your lungs an artificial lung has been installed so you can breathe underwater.

63
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,370
All of your bones, muscles and skin have been strengthened with artificial materials.

64
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,420
You are no longer an ordinary human being.

65
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,580
You're a greatly improved cyborg!

66
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,750
From now on, you will be known as Cyborg 009!

67
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,670
Cyborg 009?!

68
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,630
Yes, the ninth weapon working for the Black Ghost Organisation.

69
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,430
009, allow me to introduce your fellow cyborg comrades!

70
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Let's skip the introductions and you can all put your hands in the air!

71
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,940
What was that?! Stop joking around!

72
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,190
A joke? Not at all.

73
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,200
I couldn't do this as a joke!

74
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,280
Stop! Stop! Have you all gone mad?!

75
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,290
No, we're completely sane.

76
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,290
You the ones who gone mad!

77
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right! We're not interested in being used as tools for your terrifying plans!

78
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,420
We'll be leaving this place.

79
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,300
Like he said. Sorry, Professors!

80
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
A-Are you serious?!

81
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,930
Do you honestly plan to rebel against us?!

82
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,300
Yeah, that's right!

83
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
Go!

84
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,680
Woah there! You'd better not try anything funny!

85
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,150
By the way, would you come with us, Professor Gilmore?

86
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,150
What?!

87
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,400
You'll be our hostage. If you value your life then hurry up and get over here!

88
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,080
And you, 009.

89
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,620
You come over here too.

90
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,290
We're like brothers.

91
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,800
Well, you can trust us.

92
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,840
009, from now on you will defend peace. Come with us.

93
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,890
Come on, 009.

94
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,650
Damn!

95
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,110
Alright, everyone, let's take off in the jet we prepared!

96
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,900
Wait, you traitors!

97
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,700
What are you waiting for?!

98
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't pilot this.

99
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,370
It'll be fine! I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

100
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,840
First, twy pwessing the gween button.

101
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,940
What? You say the cyborgs escaped?

102
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,770
Please, forgive me! Please, forgive me!

103
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:02,070
Hmph! You ought to know that our Black Ghost Organisation never forgives mistakes!

104
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,160
Damnable cyborgs...

105
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,710
Do you think you can escape from Black Ghost?

106
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,760
Just when did I learn to fly a jet?

107
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,760
It's okay, 009.

108
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,760
Your superior senses as an auto racer have been multiplied several times by your artificial brain.

109
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,060
That's why Black Ghost was after your body.

110
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,230
But where should I fly to, 001?

111
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,020
Do as I say.

112
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,480
Fwy towards our base at 50°5' North, 35°20' East.

113
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,610
There's an island there.

114
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,280
001 has the body of a baby but he's a Brain Cyborg with ten times more thought power than the average adult.

115
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,790
Ahh, we're safe now.

116
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,710
We're finally free now, aren't we, 004?

117
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,210
Sure are. It was tough, 007.

118
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,750
It's good to be free.

119
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,500
Oops! Professor Gilmore's handcuffs...

120
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,170
I totally forgot.

121
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Sorry about that, Professor.

122
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,390
My, my, I'm glad it all went well, everyone. Good work.

123
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,600
Huh? What did he say?

124
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,520
That's right. 009 didn't know anything about that yet, did he?

125
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,900
009, the truth is, this escape is something that I planned.

126
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,030
Then, Professor Gilmore, you were on our side?

127
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,740
Of course! Gil's our pal in the fight against evil!

128
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,790
It's embarassing to say, but I was being used by the Black Ghost without knowing anything.

129
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,130
But I became afraid of what I had been doing.

130
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,380
Why is that?

131
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,210
Because I found out what they were after!

132
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,710
What is that?

133
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,930
To start wars around the world disrupting the peace and reducing the Earth to a mass of evil.

134
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,100
Then, to take advantage of the chaos to make a huge profit.

135
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,730
That was their goal.

136
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,600
They're terrible!

137
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,650
We were almost used to help fulfill that objective.

138
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,190
And so we ran away.

139
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,700
That's right, if we were going to have to be their slaves we'd rather...

140
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,530
Shh! All of you keep quiet!

141
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,030
What is it, 003?!

142
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,740
I can hear them! Black Ghost's fighter planes!

143
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,790
And there's a lot of them! They're coming after this jet.

144
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,830
003 has super sight and hearing.

145
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,340
She can tell anything that happens within 50 kilometres.

146
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
They keep getting closer.

147
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
At this rate, they're going to catch us!

148
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,970
Alright, let's get 'em!

149
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,610
Alright, got you!

150
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,450
Ah! There's no bullets!

151
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,740
Oh no, then there's nothing we can do, is there?

152
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,490
They're gonna get us...!

153
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,840
Don't panic, everyone! Use your powers!

154
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,470
Yeah! The enemy are remote contwolled! No need to hold back! Get 'em!

155
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,970
Right, I'm on it!

156
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,610
I'll go too!

157
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,580
002 can fly at Mach 5.

158
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,350
Oh, here they come.

159
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,520
That it? That it?

160
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,150
006 can breathe flames of up to 7000 degrees.

161
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,610
Okay, even I can do this!

162
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,130
005. He has the strength of two thousand horses.

163
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,350
Don't worry about hitting them, 009, this plane's wings are sharp blades made from specialised steel.

164
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,930
Anything they hit will be split in two!

165
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,850
Really? Okay!

166
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,840
Good work, 009!

167
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,970
Whoops!

168
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,880
We go them all! They shouldn't come after us anymore.

169
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,630
That's a relief.

170
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,180
Good work, 009!

171
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,680
For your first time in an airplane, I'm amazed you could fight so well!

172
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,890
Huh?

173
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,440
What's wrong, mechanical troubles?!

174
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,860
Oh no! The engine's out of energy!

175
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,950
So it was no good after all?

176
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,410
We've just got no luck.

177
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,700
And it's onwy 10 kilometres to the island...

178
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,250
If we can make it, there's extwa energy hidden there.

179
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
10 kilometres? Okay!

180
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,580
Let's see whether or not we can do it!

181
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We'll glide from here.

182
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,760
Our altitude keeps dropping...

183
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,930
I've got it! The island's right there!

184
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,860
Do your best. The island is surrounded by high cliffs.

185
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,610
If I screw up we'll ram right into the cliffs.

186
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,530
I've got a bad feeling about this.

187
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,290
Ah! We're going to crash!

188
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,750
S-S-Somebody save us!

189
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,370
This is no good! Fine then!

190
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,420
Now we're gonna fall into the sea!

191
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,890
As we fall we'll gain speed. We'll use that speed to rise up again.

192
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,510
That's from your experience as an auto-racer, isn't it?

193
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,570
Now!

194
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,390
It worked.

195
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,150
009, thank you, you saved us.

196
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,610
Hey, you've got some incredible abilities.

197
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,120
That's right, 009, you're a braver and more powerful cyborg than anyone else here.

198
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,960
By helping one another and perfecting your teamwork you'll be able to make full use of your power.

199
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,960
And the only one fit to lead and guide these eight, 009, is you.

200
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,470
Wow, he's our leader!

201
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,680
That's right! He'll lead our battle for peace and fweedom!

202
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,350
We're counting on you, 009.

203
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,520
All right, let's do it!

204
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
I'll do it! For peace and freedom!

205
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,020
Hurray!

206
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,080
All right, we've got no time to dawdle around.

207
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,540
Black Ghost ought to be desperately hunting for us.

208
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,380
First we have to decide what our next move will be.

209
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,420
Hmm, about that, for now...

210
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,300
Shh!

211
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,800
Someone's listening!

212
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,300
It must be an enemy spy!

213
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,470
Huh? Where?

214
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,970
Over there. See?

215
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,480
Is that all, 003? It's just a dolphin, isn't it?

216
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,900
No, that dolphin's a Spy Dolphin that's had it's brain modified and a transmitter implanted in its body.

217
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,730
All right, I'll take care of it!

218
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,860
Damn thing's swimming all calm like.

219
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,080
Good job, you hit the bullseye.

220
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
Ah, now there's something large underwater.

221
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,510
It's getting closer.

222
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,880
Is it a submarine?

223
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,220
No, it's not. I hear the sound of an entirely different machine.

224
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,780
Dinosaurs!

225
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,880
Everyone, let's run!

226
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,560
They got hit!

227
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,690
It'll be fine, they won't be taken out by something minor like that.

228
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,380
You were right.

229
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,470
Wah, that really suprise me.

230
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,180
Heheh, if I'm a rock too I won't get smashed.

231
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,320
See, I can turn my body's cells into anything.

232
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,320
These are the dinosaur robots that Black Ghost's so proud of.

233
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,700
We can't go anywhere while they're here.

234
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,240
Fine then. Let's wreck 'em.

235
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,250
002, pull me by the arm.

236
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,750
Okay!

237
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,000
Now, let go!

238
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,630
Dammit!

239
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,010
Whoa there!

240
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,720
Thanks.

241
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,940
Alright, now for this missile...

242
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,950
Okay, that's good. We got all of them.

243
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,830
Hurray!

244
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,120
It's too early to relax 007.

245
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,040
Accowding to my calcuwations the enemies will keep on coming.

246
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,210
That's right.

247
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,630
W-W-What's going to come next?

248
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,840
The roar of machines.

249
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,550
Ship engines.

250
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,090
Submarines.

251
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,590
It's a massive fleet!

252
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,610
This island is completely surrounded in both the skies and the sea.

253
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,410
Heh, they're really overdoing this.

254
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,120
There're only ten of us...

255
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:06,040
I can't blame them. You're all prototypes that may bring about a great change in the future.

256
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,920
They have to bring you back no matter what it takes.

257
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,710
Eeagh, t-t-this's bad. Let's hide.

258
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,920
It's impossible. Look at those.

259
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,760
Aren't those just bugs?

260
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Those bugs' eyes have been tuwned into spy camewas. They're spy insects.

261
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,850
The enemy alweady know where we are.

262
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,690
What detestable bugs!

263
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,900
They know everything about your abilities.

264
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,030
Every moment we spend here puts us at a greater disadvantage.

265
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,030
Somehow, we've got to get out of here and make our way to Green Reef.

266
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,200
But the jet's out of fuel. How are we gonna go?

267
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,960
Alright, let's help ourselves to one of their subs.

268
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,330
Uh, the marine cyborg was 008, right?

269
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,130
Yeah, leave the underwater stuff to me!

270
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,670
I can stay there for hours.

271
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,220
Then, 008... and 007...

272
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,220
Come with me!

273
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,440
Hey, wait for me!

274
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
This's no good.

275
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,030
Here they come.

276
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,710
Let's take that sub!

277
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,590
But we can't get near them with that Spy Dolphin there.

278
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,550
007, I'll let you take care of that.

279
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,220
Okay.

280
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,820
Come on over here. This way. This way.

281
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,450
This way. This way. This way. Oops.

282
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,290
Okay, 008, I'm counting on you.

283
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,960
Okay!

284
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,380
Huh? What was that?

285
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, our signal just got cut off.

286
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,720
Our sonar's not working either!

287
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,110
Oh, we've received a transmission.

288
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,570
The cyborgs are nearby.

289
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,990
We've been ordered to surface.

290
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,820
What?

291
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,620
Okay, take us up!

292
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,680
Why you!

293
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,640
Don't move, cyborg!

294
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,680
Hands in the air!

295
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,270
You're the ones who'll be putting your hands in the air.

296
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,020
Say what?!

297
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,900
Throw down your guns!

298
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,320
Don't worry, we won't kill you.

299
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,400
We'll just be taking your ship.

300
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,290
This is good.

301
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,000
Now for the finale.

302
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,500
003, send out a message in Morse code.

303
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,250
Right.

304
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,170
"Submarine #557 has been captured by the cyborgs."

305
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,640
Not 556. 557.

306
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,150
C-Captain, something's strange!

307
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,480
All of our subs and planes are rushing towards this ship!

308
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,150
Eh? What did you say? That's ridiculous!

309
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,030
Uwah! You were right!

310
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,650
That went well.

311
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,740
Now, full-speed ahead to Green Reef.

312
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,700
What's this Green Reef place?

313
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,750
I have a laboratory there.

314
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,040
It's not on the maps and Black Ghost doesn't know about it either.

315
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,090
It's my quiet, secret island.

316
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,960
Nice shot!

317
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,270
Ahh, it's so quiet here...

318
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,350
It's almost too quiet. I'm starting to get bored.

319
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,520
It's been a long time since I've been able to relax like this.

320
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,980
While we're relaxing here those Black Ghost guys may be plotting something.

321
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,400
We should attack their base and put an end to this quickly.

322
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,740
No! I'm tired of war!

323
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,490
War has taken everything from me.

324
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,540
My father, my mother and my happiness too...

325
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,960
It took all of them away from me.

326
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,040
003, you were from France weren't you?

327
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,550
Yes, I was born in the suburbs of Paris at Versailles.

328
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,300
My name was Francoise.

329
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,260
My dream was to become a ballerina.

330
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,390
And to dance around the world.

331
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,740
My mother died...

332
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,780
My father died too...

333
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,370
The war took all my happiness away from me.

334
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,000
Taking me and making me into a cyborg to fight in your war...

335
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,330
It's cruel! It's just too cruel!

336
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,590
I see... I understand, 003.

337
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,930
But you aren't the only one crying about the sad fate thrust upon you by the war.

338
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,020
If we leave a group like Black Ghost alone they'll only create more victims like you.

339
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,280
Do you understand?

340
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,070
The only ones who can topple the terrifying Black Ghost organisation... are us.

341
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,080
Yes, I understand.

342
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,460
We may die fighting them, but if that can make it so all the people in the world can be happy...

343
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,880
If the entire world can be at peace...

344
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,920
Wouldn't that be good enough, Francoise?

345
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,130
If we don't do it, there isn't anyone else left who can, right?

346
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,340
That's right! Let's give it everything we've got!

347
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,800
We'll use everyone's powers to create a world of peace.

348
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,770
That's right. I'll do my best.

349
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,980
We can't dawdle around any longer!

350
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,200
We'll send this world spinning into chaos.

351
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,660
At the same time, we'll bring down the hammer of justice on Professor Gilmore and those traitorous cyborgs.

352
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,290
Begin the plan immediately.

353
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,840
The Black Ghost Organisation took two nations which were already on bad terms...

354
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,840
The Caesar Republic and the country of Divine...

355
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,890
Manipulating both nations in secret they moved them towards a state of war.

356
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,230
Tensions broke between the two nations and the flames of war spread rapidly.

357
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,820
Cannons roared in the cities.

358
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,690
The sound of explosions enveloped the towns.

359
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,400
The people forgot the commandments of their god and cast aside peace.

360
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,490
All without knowing who was behind everything.

361
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,750
What fools! They've totally fallen for it!

362
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,000
If this war spreads, we'll be able to rake in tons of cash!

363
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,720
When that happens I'm sure Gilmore and the Cyborgs won't keep quiet about it.

364
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,510
They're sure to show up.

365
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,180
This is what they call "killing two birds with one stone."

366
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,970
I think this war is clearly Black Ghost's work.

367
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,850
We have to find proof of that and bring back peace.

368
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,810
Everyone agrees, right?

369
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,070
Yeah!

370
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,190
Alright! Let's begin the mission then!

371
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,070
003!

372
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,200
006!

373
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,820
Right.

374
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,910
And 007!

375
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,910
Yes Sir!

376
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,530
You three will come with me.

377
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,620
First, we'll go to the battlefield and see what's going on.

378
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,330
There's no doubt that those Black Ghost guys are up to <i>something</i>!

379
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,250
The rest of you can stay here for now and protect Professor Gilmore.

380
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,090
009, allow me to present you with something nice.

381
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,050
Something nice?

382
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,550
The fruit of my studies.

383
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,900
Now, take this.

384
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,980
Go forth and crush the nefarious plans of those war mongers!

385
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:53,950
Akai muffler nabikasete.
Their red scarves flutter in the wind.

386
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,920
Sususme saiboogu! Warera no yuushi.
Keep on going, Cyborgs! Our heroes.

387
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,430
Heiwa wo mamoru seigi no hitomi.
Defenders of peace. The eyes of justice.

388
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,350
Yukute wa arashi da. Hoeru umi.
In their way is a storm. The howling sea!

389
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,310
Oozora saegiru kuroi kumo.
Black clouds which blot out the sky.

390
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,810
Heiwa no teki da. Sekai no teki da.
The enemies of peace. The enemies of the world.

391
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,860
Chikara no kagiri tatakau zo!
Fight them with all your strength!

392
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:29,570
Akai muffler nabikasete.
Their red scarves flutter in the wind.

393
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,580
Sususme saiboogu! Warera no yuushi.
Keep on going, Cyborgs! Our heroes.

394
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,250
Heiwa wo mamoru seigi no hitomi
Defenders of peace. The eyes of justice.

395
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,880
Aa Saiboogu 009
Oh, Cyborg 009!

396
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,600
We're getting close to the Ceasar Republic's base.

397
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,970
Let's dive and do some reconnaissance.

398
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,140
Beginning submersion.

399
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,650
003, use the underwater camera.

400
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,490
Right.

401
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,910
What's this?

402
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,620
I see a new model of tank.

403
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,410
Let's try zooming in a bit more.

404
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,670
Ah! That guy's from Black Ghost!

405
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,090
That's one of their tanks behind him too.

406
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,970
He's saying "If you buy 5000 of these tanks the country of Divine will be no match for you."

407
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,380
What an awful bastard.

408
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,430
He's taking advantage of the war to make a profit.

409
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,430
He what they call a "Merchant of Death".

410
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,770
"Yeah, I gotcha."

411
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,440
"I'll contact military headquarters and have them buy some right away."

412
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,150
Dammit.

413
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,070
Alright! Let's go investigate Divine as well!

414
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,880
He's saying "With these, there's no way you'll lose to the Caesar Republic's airforce."

415
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,880
What horrible people.

416
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,510
"Consider them bought. I'll sign the order form now."

417
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,570
Guys like that are even more cruel and evil then the people actually fighting the war.

418
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,150
Jerks...

419
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,860
Right, 003?

420
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,320
Huh? 003's gone.

421
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,620
003!

422
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,170
Get down!

423
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,800
It's Black Ghost!

424
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,560
Damn... We're not going to let you beat us!

425
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,080
It's a good thing we had 003 carry a transmitter.

426
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,460
They're heading to Phantom Island, as expected.

427
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,460
They plan to carry 003 back to their secret base.

428
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,720
Nothing is more evil than kidnapping a young girl.

429
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,390
Okay, let's go to Phantom Island!

430
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,590
Phantom Island?!

431
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,260
That is terrifying island where we were made into cyborgs!

432
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,430
If we don't act quickly 003 will be in danger!

433
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,520
And that secret base is Black Ghost's headquarters.

434
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:51,360
If we destroy it and wipe out their resources, we can stop this war.

435
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,740
We absolutely have to do this for the sake of peace.

436
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,280
Understood. "Fear nothing. Summon courage. Strike at root of evil." Right?

437
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,370
Hmm... I don't understand complicated stuff, but if it's for peace I'll do anything!

438
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,290
Okay, let's go!

439
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,970
So you've come, Cyborgs.

440
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,850
Fire ET waves!

441
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,820
It's Phantom Island.

442
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,450
How I've missed it!

443
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,120
What you nostalgic about?!

444
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,870
Listen. Last time, we fled that island thinking only of our own happiness.

445
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,830
But now we're sneaking back in for the happiness of all the people in the world.

446
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,630
It's weird. I feel much calmer than when we were trying to escape.

447
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,340
"To catch tiger cub you must enter tiger den." "Venture nothing, gain nothing." They say.

448
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,760
But be careful.

449
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,390
They're the ones who created us cyborgs.

450
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,970
We don't know what kind of terrifying enemies may appear.

451
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,060
Ouch!

452
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,150
The ship's stopped!

453
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,690
What's going on?!

454
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,370
There is something squeezing the ship.

455
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,160
At this rate we'll be crushed.

456
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,960
Fine, let's go outside!

457
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,170
Oh, it's a giant octopus!

458
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,720
Look out!

459
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,810
I know! They're using special radio waves to make it more aggressive.

460
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,060
Everyone be careful!

461
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,570
Keep still!

462
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,740
Need little more vinegar. This octopus. I- Ow! Ow! Ow!

463
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,700
Now you done it!

464
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,220
Oh, Daddy!

465
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,260
Alright!

466
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,350
I'll grind you up!

467
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,440
Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.

468
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
Okay, I'll use a depth charge!

469
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,280
That did it!

470
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,900
Damn, that thing was even more of a pain to deal with than the robots!

471
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,700
Something else is coming!

472
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,080
Sharks!

473
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,830
Not just sharks... Sharks with guided missiles!

474
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,120
They're Black Ghost weapons.

475
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,250
The shark's instinct to attack is hooked into the missile guidance system.

476
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,380
Ah! They're after the ship!

477
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,560
Don't let the missiles hit the ship!

478
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,240
I know! Break the sharks' guidance systems!

479
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,090
I take care of line over there.

480
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,090
Ninja Art: Shark Transformation

481
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,430
Looks a bit strange, but oh well.

482
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,430
These things are dumb as a sack of hammers.

483
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,950
Ah, I'm exhausted.

484
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,290
Now we safe.

485
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,460
Now, let's hurry. I'm worried about 003.

486
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,710
You traitor.

487
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,510
We're going to give you an operation to make sure you never think of doing such a horrible thing again.

488
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,930
Heheheheheh... You'll lose the ability to think and judge for yourself.

489
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,610
In short, you'll be Black Ghost's loyal slave acting only on the signals we send you.

490
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,120
We've finally made it to the enemy's base. Don't let your guards down.

491
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,090
G-G-God let no ghosts come out.

492
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,100
Ahh! Cobras!

493
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,770
Are these things robots?!

494
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,200
Excuse me.

495
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,120
Have to be very careful.

496
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,960
Mountains, rivers, grass and trees. Nature is terrifying enemy.

497
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,760
Seriously, this place is creepy. I feel awful.

498
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,260
I wish we'd never come here.

499
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,930
There's no resting on this island, really.

500
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,930
-Ah!
-Look out!

501
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,010
It's no good! That bastard's tough.

502
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,140
Nothing we can do.

503
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,560
Hahahahahahah... Is that all the power you can muster?!

504
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,560
You won't be able to beat me like this!

505
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,530
Lets do this!

506
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,080
Ahh! It is getting hot!

507
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,620
Ah! Save me!

508
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,620
Hot! Hot Hot Hot Hot!

509
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,000
Wait...

510
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,880
Compared to the rest of its body... that eye is pretty small.

511
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,760
There's got to be a reason.

512
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:17,220
Guys! Shoot at the same place that I do!

513
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,930
Yessir!

514
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,480
Now!

515
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,250
Its eyes were its weak point.

516
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,260
Hey! You! The cool guy over there!

517
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,810
What're you?

518
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,890
I'm a new recruit. Just got here today.

519
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,730
You're a bit short, aren't you?

520
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,560
Heheheh... Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

521
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,980
Here, a gift between new comrades.

522
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,950
Piece of cake! You can come out now!

523
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,200
Stealthily, stealthily....

524
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,620
Uh oh!

525
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,420
That was dangerous... Alright.

526
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,800
Squeak.

527
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,800
Strange place full of strange things.

528
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,610
No room to let your guard down here.

529
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,990
Ah! Get down!

530
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,830
Damn! That was dangerous...

531
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,460
I have bad feeling.

532
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,880
Stealthily...

533
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,050
Agh! It's a cat!

534
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,020
It's a dead end!

535
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,330
Wink.

536
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,510
W-What's that?!

537
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,970
Is 003!

538
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,350
Hey, 003!

539
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,020
They kill her?

540
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,060
003!

541
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,940
Hey! Hang in there!

542
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,020
Hey!

543
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,360
Namu amida butsu. Namu amida butsu.

544
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,240
What's wrong, 003?

545
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,630
Hahahaha! Good work, 003!

546
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,710
You fools! You've fallen into our trap wonderfully!

547
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,510
003 isn't your comrade anymore.

548
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,510
Oh no! Were we too late?

549
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,390
Hey! There should be one left! Hunt him down!

550
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,100
Sir, we've already captured 007.

551
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,270
Have you? That's good.

552
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,650
007's been caught too?

553
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,400
It because he so scatterbrained.

554
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,730
Shut up! Quit your grumbling.

555
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,360
You! Take their weapons!

556
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,190
Yes Sir!

557
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:09,370
Okay, now we'll use brain surgery to turn 007 into a loyal slave of Black Ghost like we did with 003.

558
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,000
However, you two won't be so lucky!

559
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,170
Your cybernetic systems are so complicated that further brain surgery is impossible.

560
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,590
As such, you have my sympathies, but you're going to have to die here.

561
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,460
Take aim!

562
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,800
Damn, this is really too bad.

563
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,380
We done for.

564
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,590
Fire!

565
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,390
Now!

566
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,640
Catch!

567
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,060
Who are you?!

568
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,770
Sometimes a rat...

569
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,480
Sometimes a cat...

570
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,610
At other times a soldier of Black Ghost...

571
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:50,280
But my true identity is the cyborg of Love and Truth, 007!

572
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,160
007!

573
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,910
Why you! Shoot all three of them!

574
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,830
Come. Come. Come this way.

575
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,960
Ninja Art: Bazooka Shuriken!

576
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,380
Bazooka!

577
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,400
Oh no!

578
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,490
Stop!

579
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,080
You jerk!

580
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,920
You can't escape now!

581
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,130
It look like you should give up.

582
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,670
You're the boss, so act like one.

583
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,010
W-Wait!

584
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,590
I'm not the boss of Black Ghost!

585
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:12,680
What did you say?!

586
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,180
Lying is bad.

587
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,510
I-It's true!

588
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,220
You think you can trick us?!

589
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,770
Wait, there's someone else in this room.

590
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,110
The real boss... The real war profiteer...

591
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:26,980
Is right there!

592
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,990
Good job, 009.

593
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,820
You did well to figure it out.

594
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,370
You cockroaches... Do you wish to see my true form so badly?

595
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,130
Beagle...

596
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,720
Take responsibility for your failure.

597
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,190
009, as you've guessed, I am the boss of Black Ghost.

598
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,440
Why you!

599
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,230
It's not just Black Ghost...

600
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:13,240
I've been starting wars between you foolish humans since long ago.

601
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:19,120
The first and second world war were both my work.

602
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:25,830
Feeding on the blood of the slaughter, the tears of the suffering and the hatred of one man for another...

603
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,460
I've gradually grown bigger and stronger.

604
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,170
Even when the war ends and the losing generals and politicians are executed...

605
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,140
No one has ever tried to punish me.

606
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:44,270
They all speak of peace, but all it takes is a little whisper from me and the humans soon begin the killing.

607
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,690
What fools!

608
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,310
You devil!

609
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,440
You're wrong!

610
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,110
I did not create myself.

611
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,070
What created me and helped me grow was the ugly greed that lies in the heart of mankind!

612
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,870
Well, that's enough of that.

613
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,660
It seems the end has come for you.

614
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,920
As a small mercy, I'll let you be sent off to the next world at the hands of your former comrade.

615
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,800
Come forth, my adorable 003.

616
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,680
That's a specially made electron gun.

617
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,480
Ideal for shooting cyborgs.

618
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,480
Now, 003, finish them and don't hold back.

619
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,320
Wait, 003! Don't you recognise us?!

620
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,080
003, wait!

621
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,790
Stop this! Don't you recognise us?

622
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,500
Stop! Give me the gun!

623
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,470
Let go!

624
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,640
003!

625
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:07,810
Now you've done it, 009!

626
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,080
Hang in there, 003.

627
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,000
What... happened to me?

628
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,500
009, this time it's my loss.

629
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,420
I shall perish but the Black Ghost will not be destroyed.

630
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,300
And now you're finished.

631
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,930
When I die the detonator on the H-Bomb will begin its countdown.

632
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,770
Say what?!

633
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,930
H-Bomb?!

634
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:52,480
That's right. In five minutes this whole island will be blown away.

635
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,030
Farewell, my brave little heroes.

636
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,530
-T-This is terrible!
-We have to run!

637
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,990
Damn this wall!

638
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,210
It's no good 009! That wall is made with a super special steal alloy!

639
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,670
I-It's only another four minutes!

640
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,180
Okay, we'll put all our power together.

641
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,350
006, use all the heat you can to melt that wall.

642
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,010
Right!

643
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,640
Everyone, shoot the same spot with your ray guns.

644
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,910
I run out of energy soon.

645
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,120
Do your best! Keep shooting for as long as you've got the energy!

646
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,560
It's working! It's started to melt!

647
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,060
Only three minutes left!

648
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,560
How about this?!

649
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,570
It's open!

650
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,690
Everyone follow me!

651
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,030
Hurry! The exit's this way!

652
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:30,490
Let's hurry and get aboard! The bomb's going to go off!

653
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,790
Not gonna happen, Cyborgs!

654
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,840
We're taking this ship.

655
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,000
Damn...

656
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,970
Alright, everyone, let's set sail. Start the engine!

657
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,930
There's only a minute left.

658
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,390
Later! Just stay there and get blown up!

659
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,310
You guys!

660
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,770
We came after you because we figured something like this might happen.

661
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,110
No time to waste! There's onwy 15 seconds until the expwosion!

662
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:11,870
Press the flight button!

663
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,920
Three... Two... One...

664
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:33,350
And so, the devil was defeated and the people awakened.

665
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:38,560
An end came to the battle and peace returned to the world once more.

666
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,820
The cyborgs' work was finished.

667
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:47,030
They returned to their original forms and each returned to their homelands.

668
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,320
009, to being the auto-racer Shimamura Joe.

669
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,080
003, to being a ballerina in Paris.

670
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,460
007, to being a mischievous brat in London.

671
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,130
They returned to the lives originally granted to them by God.

672
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,970
However, the evil Black Ghost, that dark dream of war...

673
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,890
The Black Ghost, nurtured by the ugly greed in people's hearts...

674
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,810
Can anyone truly say that they shall never return?

675
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,940
"I shall perish but the Black Ghost will not be destroyed."

676
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,070
When that time come we'll have to gather once more.

677
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,360
I hope that never happens.

678
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,330
Lord, let this peace last forever.

679
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,500
END
