1
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,792
I'll get back to you, I'm meeting friends.
-Do you have the code?

2
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,333
Just a second.

3
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,542
Call them if not.

4
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,583
Hang on, I'm looking.

5
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,042
Ruti, can't we just call?
It would be a lot faster.

6
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,167
Hang on, he sent it to me...
-Excuse me.

7
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,167
I love what you've done with the place.

8
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,500
Totally.

9
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,125
Thanks.

10
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,417
Yeah, we felt we wanted
something with lots of space.

11
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,250
It would have cost twice
as much in central Tel Aviv.

12
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,875
It's only a matter of time
before this neighbourhood changes.

13
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,833
Oh no, it's happening. It's happening.

14
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,750
What do you think about the tree?

15
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,958
That one?

16
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,458
Nice.
-I planted it.

17
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,375
Very nice.

18
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,958
Okay.

19
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,875
You remember how to do it.

20
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,875
So, how was San Francisco?
-Listen, you have to go.

21
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,833
You'll love it.
-Totally.

22
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,875
Not... not because you're gay,
just because the city's great.

23
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,083
Roy really did love it.
-How about you, how was Sinai?

24
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,292
I've never been to Sinai.

25
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,167
Sinaiâ€™s gorgeous.
-We're having a baby.

26
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,208
Wow!

27
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,708
I'm shocked.

28
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,583
That's great!
-We're not pregnant yet. But...

29
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,375
Soon, probably.
-Listen, good for you.

30
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,625
Really.

31
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,792
So, give me the details,
how are you going to do it?

32
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,417
We've decided to use a surrogate.
-We're doing it by ourselves.

33
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,042
Without adding more factors to the equation.
-Right.

34
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,957
How does that work?

35
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,082
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.

36
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,082
Wait, should I not be asking?

37
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,750
No, it's fine.
-There's a small agency we're working with.

38
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,833
Great.
-Right.

39
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,750
It's small, not like one of these powerhouses...
-No, it's very intimate,

40
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,250
the agency picks the surrogate mother.
-Right.

41
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,333
You don't pick yourselves?

42
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,208
We pick the egg.
-How do you know who she is?

43
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,958
The egg or the surrogate?

44
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,792
The surrogate.
-Oh, we don't.

45
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,333
But the agency has a cadre of women
it works with, mostly from Asia.

46
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,917
And you don't get to meet her beforehand?

47
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,583
We're meeting her after the delivery?
-After.

48
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:15,667
Yes, it's done very humanely.
-Very humane and very considerate.

49
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,750
They don't even let her see the baby.

50
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,000
They take it, so they don't form
any physical or biological bonds.

51
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,917
From the moment she gives birth, the baby's ours.

52
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,583
Really amazing of you.
Wow.

53
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So there might be a baby here in a few months.
-Hey!

54
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:37,833
And hey, are you going to raise them
in this neighbourhood?

55
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:42,083
Yes. -I think it's important that they grow up
in an environment that's multicultural.

56
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,167
Diverse.
-Pluralistic.

57
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,708
Plus, the neighbourhood's really changing.

58
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,125
Well, you'll be an amazing dad.

59
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,458
The sperm's going to be mine, though.

60
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,625
So why do you think she's doing it?

61
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,792
Who?
-The mother.

62
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,333
The surrogate.
-The surrogate.

63
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:12,875
We'd like to think she wants to help
people like us have children.

64
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:16,042
Honey, not everyone has the privilege
of getting pregnant naturally.

65
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,958
Ben and Erez don't have the
privilege of getting pregnant.

66
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,083
Glad to hear my womb is a privilege now.

67
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,417
In this context.

68
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,042
I wish I could get pregnant.

69
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:57,458
(Speaking in Tigrinya)

70
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:27,833
Hey.

71
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,375
Could you please not lean on the tree?

72
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,375
The tree?

73
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,375
Could you not lean on the tree?
-Oh, sorry man.

74
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,292
It's just, you'll break it.

75
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,375
Sorry.
-It's fine.

76
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,917
Thanks.

77
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,833
They broke the tree?

78
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,292
No, they didn't, they didn't break it.

79
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,125
It's just, one's standing next to the tree and his
buddy's standing next to him and they're talking,

80
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:37,833
but one of them is just leaning on it,
it's a thin tree, it's new, the city

81
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,500
just planted it, so it would be
a shame if they broke it.

82
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,833
So they're damaging public property.
-That's what I said.

83
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,792
Could you send someone
to tell them stop? I can't...

84
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,208
Could you give me your contact information?
-Is it alright if I don't? It's not necessary.

85
00:12:55,625 --> 00:13:00,417
These penguins are all heading
to the open waters to the right.

86
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,000
But one of them caught our eye.

87
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:13,875
He would neither go to the breeding grounds
at the edge of the ice, nor return to the colony.

88
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,125
Let me see your hands!

89
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,375
Running from the police?

90
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,125
Running from the police? You son of a bitch!

91
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,625
Who do you think you are?

92
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,125
Who do you think you are,
running from police? You piece of shit!

93
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,792
Who do you think you are?

94
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,500
You son of a bitch!

95
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,500
50, this is 51, come in.
-51, this is 50, over.

96
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,167
50, we have the detainee.
Y.L. Peretz 44.

97
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,750
Send a car please.
-Car headed your way.

98
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:03,083
What happened?
-It's fine, have a good night.

99
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,542
Did he do anything?
-Have a good night, I said.

100
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,083
Good evening, sir. Thank you.

101
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,167
Motherfucker, these pieces of shit
are ruining the neighbourhood.

102
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,208
Loser.

103
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,167
50, what about that car?

104
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,958
What are you looking at?

105
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,416
No.

106
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,708
She's got nice teeth.
-They stick out a bit.

107
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,208
Bad teeth is a huge expense.
-Right.

108
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,875
Wow. Perfect.
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.

109
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,167
Uh...

110
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:43,708
No.

111
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,417
No.

112
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,500
Her kid looks amazing.

113
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,833
Ben?

114
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,833
Ben?

115
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,000
You went to Sinai recently, right?
-Yeah.

116
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,458
You weren't scared?

117
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,208
No.

118
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
I'm thinking of going too.

119
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,875
You've never been?
-No.

120
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,458
It's the most beautiful, relaxing place ever.

121
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,125
The blue of the ocean, the sky.

122
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,667
The first day was a bit stressful,
but past that point...

123
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,417
Itâ€™s the place to be.

124
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,875
Hello.
-Hello, Ben?

125
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:06,458
Yes.
-This is Guy from municipal services.

126
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,000
I see you've lodged a complaint regarding
damage to public property,

127
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:13,750
and I wanted to ask how satisfied you were
with the handling of the issue.

128
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,917
A complaint about two migrant workers
vandalising a tree on Y.L. Peretz Street.

129
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,542
What? Wait, what?

130
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,875
How would you rate our handling
of the issue, on a scale of one to ten?

131
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:26,292
I can't talk right now. This isn't a good time.

132
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,625
I understand, it won't take long.

133
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,542
Just tell me how satisfied you were
with our handling of the issue,

134
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,500
one meaning we handled it poorly,
and ten meaning we handled it very well.

135
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,750
We've been thinking of investing
in your neighbourhood too.

136
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,167
Oh?
-Not a place for us to live, just an investment.

137
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:34,667
You've inspired us.
-Oh yeah?

138
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:39,125
We have a friend who works for the city council,

139
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,583
she says there are incredible plans for the area,

140
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,208
that it's all going to change five years from now.

141
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,833
Hey.

142
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,500
Hey.

143
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,583
How's it going?

144
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,625
There's shit in the entrance,
on the stairwell. -What?

145
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,208
Dog or human?

146
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,792
Human.

147
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:52,542
Fuck. Are you sure.
-Yes. What are you making?

148
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,542
Curry.
-Perfect.

149
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,583
I'm not cleaning it up.

150
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,292
Fine, then I will. Where's the sand?
-No, you will not! You will not!

151
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,125
We're not cleaning it up, that's not my job.

152
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,333
Cleaning up shit is not my job.

153
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,542
Okay.

154
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,208
How's it going, Ben-Ben?

155
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,750
Good god.

156
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,750
Come on, let me help you.

157
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:10,333
How does a person get through two doors
with keypad locks and shit in the stairwell?

158
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,625
We have to change the code.

159
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,708
You remember we're thinking of leaving, right?

160
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,708
You mentioned that.

161
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:26,458
Jenny's going to go first, we found a place,

162
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,333
and I'll join her in about a month.

163
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,125
Oh.

164
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,875
She wants to work in her first language, somewhere
familiar, plus her dad's not feeling well,

165
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,458
and I can do my writing anywhere.

166
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,833
Wow...

167
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,250
I'm worn out. I'm just worn out.

168
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:50,583
The homeless, the junkies,
the refugees. It breaks my heart.

169
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,667
Someone died in there.

170
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,250
Come to Berlin too. We'll be
on the co-op board together.

171
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,042
Who's there?
-Sorry.

172
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,125
I just had the worst dream.

173
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,833
What was it?

174
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,500
I had a dream we were...

175
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,208
at a hospital in the Philippines,

176
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,750
they give us a baby.

177
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,458
We get home,

178
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,708
I look at her face,

179
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:20,958
and I realise it's the homeless woman
that used to sleep in the stairwell.

180
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,417
Remember her?

181
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,375
Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Stunning.

182
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,708
You're gorgeous. Hang on, one more.

183
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,083
You're stunning, really. Thank you.

184
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,500
Boys, how about you?

185
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,458
Okay, I'm taking the picture.

186
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,042
But hold up your sign for the camera.

187
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,750
Higher, higher.

188
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,875
Honey, get out of the way.

189
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,750
"Equality!"

190
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,708
Now kiss!

191
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,958
Gorgeous. Amazing, great job.

192
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,583
Welcome to Pride!

193
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:31,500
Next stop, Heinrich Heine, Ben Zvi Road.

194
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,583
Morning.
-Hi, good morning.

195
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,125
Coffee?

196
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,208
Yes, please.

197
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,083
I'll have some with you.

198
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,750
I only have almond milk left.

199
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,083
I like almond milk.

200
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,833
Would you like us to move to the mats?

201
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,833
No. Here's fine.

202
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,375
How's the surrogacy situation going?

203
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,208
How it's going...

204
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,125
It's going.

205
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,542
We need to choose an egg now.

206
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,792
Our parents are helping out
with the money, so that's...

207
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,833
reassuring.

208
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:12,208
Last time, when we were sitting on the mats,

209
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,500
you mentioned having some dilemmas.

210
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,667
There's some worry, it's only natural.

211
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,500
We had a lot of opportunities
to think it over, given the situation.

212
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,000
It's not like one of us got pregnant,

213
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,042
so it's not exactly spontaneous.

214
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:39,417
Maybe it's not such a good idea,
you know. I don't know.

215
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,375
What isn't a good idea?

216
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,167
For instance, a few days ago

217
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,125
I fell asleep on the couch in the
living room, we had some friends over,

218
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,625
I fell asleep on the couch,
I woke up in the middle of the night,

219
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:02,792
I was headed to the bedroom, and
suddenly I heard a noise from outside, a...

220
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,417
Weird noise.

221
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,875
Something compelled me to see what it was,

222
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:17,125
and I went to the window,
and I saw an African man running,

223
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:21,458
and two policemen chasing him.

224
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:24,833
Now, the street was completely empty.

225
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,625
They caught him,

226
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,833
twisted his arm behind his back,
got him down on the pavement,

227
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,833
kicked the shit out of him.

228
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,667
What did you do?

229
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,125
What?

230
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,083
When you saw that, what did you do?

231
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,833
I went downstairs to try and stop them,

232
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,625
but they were so violent.

233
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,792
I tried, but they were just
like animals, I just felt...

234
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,708
completely paralysed.

235
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,750
Let's set the refugee aside for a moment.

236
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,792
Where in your body did you have that sensation?

237
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,625
In my stomach.

238
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,542
I want us to try something.

239
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:55,958
I want us to try and pretend
this cushion is the refugee.

240
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:01,625
Right? I want you to try and stop me. Okay?

241
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:06,833
We're reenacting the incident, try and stop me.

242
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,667
Stop me.

243
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,167
Next stop: New Central Bus Station.

244
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,333
What's for dinner?

245
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,458
Nothing.

246
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,500
You didn't get anything?

247
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,333
Turn right.

248
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,708
You have arrived.

249
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,125
Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

250
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,542
How's it going?
-Some wild weather we're having, huh?

251
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:07,917
Right.

252
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,958
Park here by the gate.

253
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,125
Here?
-Yes.

254
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,417
There you go.
-That okay?

255
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,792
Yes, that's great.

256
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:27,833
Alright.

257
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,917
Hello, welcome.

258
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,208
How are you?

259
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,250
Hi, how are you?
-Hey.

260
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,750
Next time you're here, my office is going to be
down here, at the housing unit in the basement.

261
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:49,833
Let's go in.

262
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:01,000
Sunny, 31 years old from Manila.
She's strong, healthy.

263
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:05,000
She's got three children of her own,
this will be her second surrogacy.

264
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,125
All told she's had four healthy deliveries,

265
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:10,042
and during the last one, the baby
was healthy and his weight was normal.

266
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,333
She looks healthy.
-That's true.

267
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,667
It's important to us that the baby
have a healthy pregnancy environment.

268
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:19,375
No, Sunny doesn't drink or smoke,

269
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,000
she lives in a suburb where
there are no high levels of pollution.

270
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:25,417
We can't dictate a specific diet,
but she's familiar with the process,

271
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,625
Her previous delivery was
handled exceptionally well.

272
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,625
What's great about this process is that it's an
incredible opportunity for both parties.

273
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,792
Your lives are going to change,
you're going to be parents,

274
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,958
and Sunny's life is going to change as well,

275
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,708
And she earns a something of
a small fortune in her terms.

276
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,708
Have you chosen an egg?

277
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,833
No. Not yet, but...

278
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,917
we have some candidates in mind.
-Okay.

279
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,792
Well, I suggest you do it soon,
we don't want to let that hold us up.

280
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:57,542
Of course. Hey, about the sperm, is there
any way to not do it at a hospital or clinic?

281
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:02,292
We were hoping to do it somewhere
more suitable to our needs.

282
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,958
Why, is the clinic too far away?

283
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,875
No, it's not about distance.
We just wanted a place that was...

284
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,417
more special, less cold.

285
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,792
Listen, you're going to be incredible parents.

286
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,250
I have intuition about that sort of thing.

287
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:19,458
But you can't do it at home,
the sperm has to be frozen immediately.

288
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,917
But we can explore other options.

289
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,417
You have a lovely home.
-Thank you.

290
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,333
We both work hard...

291
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,750
Where's the restroom?

292
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,917
Right there.

293
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,917
Police.
-Hello.

294
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:40,000
I'd like to inquire about...

295
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:44,625
an arrest that took place outside my building.
-Okay.

296
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,042
The other day I saw some police officers

297
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:53,708
chasing a man, who was probably African, I think.
-Okay.

298
00:40:55,333 --> 00:41:00,042
They beat the crap out of him.
-Do you have any idea what he did?

299
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,792
What difference does that make?
It's... police brutality.

300
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,083
What's your involvement in the incident?

301
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,792
I care, I...

302
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,958
I care.

303
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,750
Can I ask how he's doing?

304
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,125
Do you know the detainee?

305
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,167
No.

306
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:23,500
No, I've got nothing to do with him.
I'm a concerned citizen.

307
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,708
May I ask how the gentleman is doing?

308
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,167
Please hold.

309
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,375
How cute is Maya?

310
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,500
At the roundabout, take the second exit.

311
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:31,333
What... where are you?

312
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,458
Did you have sex with somebody?

313
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,417
No.

314
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:02,958
Okay.

315
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,167
I'm sorry, I...

316
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,542
I just can't stop thinking about...

317
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,833
something Rotem told me.

318
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,833
What is it?

319
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,958
We were having a cigarette, and he
told me that the other day the police

320
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,667
caught an African refugee.

321
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:32,208
Right outside here, on the street.
-No kidding.

322
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,625
They kicked the shit out of him.

323
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,042
That's what he said.

324
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,833
He said they beat him until he passed out,

325
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:45,375
once they'd already incapacitated him.
-Incapacitated...

326
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,000
What does that mean?

327
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,667
They grabbed his arm and
slammed him down on the sidewalk.

328
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,667
Even if he'd done something,
if he was a thief, I don't know,

329
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,000
once they incapacitated him, who does that...
-That's what I said.

330
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:09,750
Past a certain point, regardless of what he did,
that's just wrong.

331
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,458
They kicked him until he started bleeding
and passed out, I think he died.

332
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,000
How do you know he died?

333
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,625
I heard a woman crying.

334
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,833
You heard a woman crying so you think he died?

335
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,875
No, Rotem told me.

336
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,500
They did an amazing job with the place.

337
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,500
People still shoot up here at night, you know.

338
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,708
Everything's in bloom. It's lovely.

339
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,375
Have you sold the apartment?

340
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,667
We got a good offer.

341
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,583
We don't want to draw it out.

342
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:26,708
How good?

343
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,583
Good.

344
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,792
How good?
-We got a good offer.

345
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,792
We had a good realtor.

346
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,125
You want to talk to him?

347
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,167
No...

348
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:45,625
He's a great realtor.
-No.

349
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,458
Kobi, Hi. Yeah, it's Rotem.

350
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:58,792
I'm here with my neighbour,
he's got a gorgeous apartment.

351
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,208
Here, talk to him.

352
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,667
No...
-Talk to him.

353
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:06,542
Kobi?
-Kobi.

354
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,000
Kobi?
-Nice to meet you.

355
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,875
Hey, likewise, how are you?

356
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:27,500
Hey.
-Hey.

357
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:31,583
Nice place.

358
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,833
Thanks.
-Really special.

359
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,167
What is it, 80 square meters?
-90, give or take.

360
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,000
Same as Rotem's.

361
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,875
What's the municipal tax size?

362
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,125
82.

363
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,542
Why are you selling, if I might ask?

364
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,000
Why are you selling?
-What difference does it make?

365
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,625
We'll have an open house, there'll be
lots of people here, they're going to ask.

366
00:47:56,667 --> 00:48:00,125
Maybe you're selling because there's something
wrong with the apartment. -I need the money.

367
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,750
Well, don't say that,
they'll smell your desperation.

368
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,792
Oh.
-So...

369
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:07,750
Listen, I have someone looking
for something this size in this area,

370
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,125
you mind if I put her on?

371
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,958
I know we're moving fast, but she means business.

372
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,333
Okay.

373
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,708
Bonjour, Tami.

374
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,208
Bonjour, Kobi.

375
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,208
I'm at the place I was telling you about,

376
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,458
I think it might be
just the thing you're looking for.

377
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,750
Alright.
-You want a tour?

378
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,375
Sure.

379
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,167
This is the living room.

380
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,917
Very nice.

381
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,125
It's big.

382
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,958
This is the washroom.

383
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,750
Well, I like the apartment.

384
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,000
It's a good investment,
a four percent annual return.

385
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,792
What are the neighbours like?

386
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,625
Are there lots of Arabs? Black people?

387
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:14,375
A lot of migrant workers?

388
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:16,833
The whole area's going to change
in a year or two.

389
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:21,458
There are some immigrants, Filipino, Eritrean,

390
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,667
but there are several Israelis as well.

391
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,875
Oh, a real Tower of Babylon.

392
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,833
Do they cause any trouble?

393
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,458
In a year or two this whole area
is going to be incredible.

394
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:35,167
Where are you from?

395
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,500
Paris.

396
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,750
Then why would you want to move here?

397
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,125
"Here" is my home.

398
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,875
Israel is my home.

399
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,792
Paris isn't what it used to be.

400
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,375
It turned into an Al-Qaeda outpost,
there's so much antisemitism.

401
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,458
You have to be careful.

402
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,083
You can't walk around wearing a yarmulke.

403
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,875
You need to be constantly vigilant.

404
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:15,875
Darkie!

405
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:19,125
How's everything going, Darkie?
-Okay.

406
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,292
Yeah?

407
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,167
Has your wife had her operation?

408
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,167
Yeah, she's fine now.

409
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,250
Doing well?
-Doing well.

410
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,792
Great, I haven't seen you in a while,
Blackie, I was getting worried.

411
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,167
Excuse me!

412
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,750
Could you not call him that?

413
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,167
Don't call him that.

414
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,917
What's your name?
-It's fine.

415
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:44,542
What's your name?
-Kobi.

416
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,708
Kobi.
-Yes.

417
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:47,875
Kobi.

418
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,375
Idiot.
- Motherfucker.

419
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:55,667
Hey.

420
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,167
Stop!

421
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,792
Stop, I want to have a word with you.

422
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,417
Hello.
-Hi.

423
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,542
Could you check if I can suspend my membership?

424
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,833
Let's step outside, I'd like
to have a word with you.

425
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,708
Let's step outside, I just want to talk.

426
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,042
Man, I'm not going outside with you.
-Excuse me, not here.

427
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,958
Tell him to go outside, I want to talk to him.

428
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,750
Did you call my mother a whore?

429
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,083
Let's go outside!
-Can you help me out here?

430
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,958
Excuse me, I'm calling the police.
-Call them.

431
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,292
Let's go outside, I'm gonna kick your ass.
I'm gonna fuck you all the way up.

432
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:31,042
You think my mother's a whore?
-I'm calling the police.

433
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,083
Please call them.
-Say you're sorry.

434
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,625
I said I was sorry.

435
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,583
I said it.
-No you didn't.

436
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,250
I'm sorry.

437
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,583
Say: "I'm sorry I called your mother a whore."

438
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,708
I'm sorry I called your mother a whore.

439
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,083
Okay? I'm sorry I called your mother a whore.

440
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,917
I don't usually say things like that,
I don't know what came over me.

441
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,125
I apologise.

442
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,917
I'm genuinely sorry, man.

443
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:41,042
Hello.
-Hello.

444
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,708
My condolences.

445
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:07,417
No. Sit here, here.
-No no, I... it's fine.

446
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:08,875
No, sit here.

447
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,750
Thank you.

448
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:18,708
Have some water.
-Thank you.

449
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:56,958
Where are you from?

450
00:56:58,667 --> 00:56:59,792
I'm from the building.

451
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,458
You live in the building?
-The apartment below you.

452
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,625
You're the owner?
-I'm head of the building committee.

453
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,750
Were you born in Israel?

454
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,333
Yes.

455
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,542
I came from Eritrea.

456
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,083
I was born in Eritrea.

457
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,375
I went from Eritrea to Sudan, from Sudan to Sinai,

458
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,083
and then to Israel.

459
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,167
You know Sinai?

460
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,167
Yeah.

461
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:03,833
What's your name?
-Ben.

462
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:05,833
I'm Yashulu.
-Hi.

463
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,500
Nice to meet you.

464
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,750
And he can't catch it by himself.

465
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,583
So the pair now work together.

466
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,333
Let's do something.

467
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:46,125
Alright, what do you feel like?
-I don't know.

468
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,542
We could go see a movie, go out for a drink.

469
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,333
You want to take a walk?

470
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:23,833
We're going to have the roof resealed,
we'll get a ten-year warranty.

471
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,125
We replaced the flooring
and the windows two years ago.

472
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,042
Parquet floors, new plumbing,

473
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:35,000
three months ago everyone
in the building joined together

474
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,125
and had all the plumbing replaced.

475
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:40,792
We had to go all out, because there
had been some problems here, it was bad,

476
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,833
the winters were awful.

477
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:45,708
Shouldn't you be at work?

478
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,625
Hello.
-This is Raz, my...

479
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,500
Lovely place you have here.

480
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,792
How many balconies have you enclosed?

481
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,792
It was two, right?
-Hey, man.

482
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:01,083
You're the boyfriend? Nice to meet you, I'm Kobi.

483
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,833
Could you have everyone clear out of here, please?

484
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:05,042
Give me a second, okay?

485
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,417
We'll be out of your hair in a minute.

486
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,958
Have you replaced the windows?
Do they have double glazing?

487
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:14,708
She wants to know if the windows
have double insulation. -Yes.

488
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,875
In this area you can't do without
double glazing, but forget that,

489
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,125
the whole apartment is new.

490
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:25,083
The floor, the walls,
all of the electrical is new,

491
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:27,125
they even replaced the plumbing. Did you tell her?

492
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,583
They replaced the plumbing.

493
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:32,083
This part of town, which, five years
from now it's going to be, you know...

494
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:35,542
It's... a safe investment, let's say.

495
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,625
The apartment's lovely.

496
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:48,500
Why do you think you're here, Raz?

497
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:56,667
We're here, Reuven,
because he tried to sell our apartment

498
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,250
behind my back.

499
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,667
He doesn't really tell me anything.

500
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,042
I do.
-No you don't.

501
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:07,708
Has he told you we're not having sex?

502
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,458
We don't really communicate.

503
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:14,958
What do you think?

504
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,417
I don't think there's a lack of attraction.

505
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:29,750
I don't think we're not communicating
properly, we talk all the time.

506
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:40,083
I just think we shouldn't live there.

507
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,042
And we certainly shouldn't raise children there.

508
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,208
We'll never find a place like that
in a better neighbourhood

509
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,083
on our budget.
-It's not a good environment to raise a child.

510
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,875
Why?

511
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:54,833
Because it's a bad place.

512
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,167
We...

513
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,417
because it's a bad place, and I hate it.

514
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,792
Why are you saying this?
-I hate this place,

515
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:06,250
I don't want my kids to have a father like this.
-Like what?

516
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,792
A father who hates this place.

517
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,625
Hates?
-I hate...

518
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:12,417
Come on! I told you.

519
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,958
This place gets me into situations
I'm not supposed to get involved in!

520
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:18,125
Nothing like this ever happened
in seven years on Frishman Street.

521
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:24,583
That guy that the cops
beat up outside our building,

522
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,333
I called the cops on him.

523
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:29,417
He was leaning on a tree
I planted outside, he almost broke it.

524
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:34,750
I went downstairs, I asked him,
I asked him nicely.

525
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,167
"Please, don't lean on my tree,
you'll break my tree."

526
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,292
But they don't understand!

527
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,583
They don't know about cities.

528
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:45,208
They don't know about public spaces.

529
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,958
They grew up in villages.

530
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,417
Maybe I do hate them.

531
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:03,167
I think that's true, it feels good,
my body feels good, saying that.

532
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,833
We don't even share the same values.

533
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,917
There are certain values we have,

534
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:19,958
whereas they come from very patriarchal societies.

535
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,833
They go through terrible trauma,

536
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,417
and yet we expect them
to coexist in the same space with us.

537
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:28,042
It's not their fault, it's not their fault
they're poor and downtrodden,

538
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,958
it's not their fault they've
endured terrible things.

539
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:33,458
It's not even their fault
that I hate them, and yet!

540
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,083
How can you say that?

541
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:38,167
I can't believe this.
Do you realise what you're saying?

542
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,083
We don't say things like that.
-Wait.

543
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,458
I...

544
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,833
I'd like to make a suggestion, okay?

545
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:56,875
You planted the tree
out on the street because you care,

546
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:00,875
you want the area around
your home to be pleasant.

547
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,792
When you saw those young men
leaning against the tree,

548
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:08,583
you went down to talk to them, and asked them

549
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,208
to not lean against the tree.

550
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:17,083
You only wanted the area to be pleasant,

551
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:21,750
you didn't want them to break the tree.

552
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:27,125
But what happened then?

553
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:32,750
Once you called municipal services
things got out of hand, right?

554
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:38,583
You never imagined the situation
would turn so violent, right?

555
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:45,167
You treated them like human beings,
like equals, like your neighbours.

556
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,750
Just a second.

557
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,958
Sorry.
-So?

558
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,208
What?

559
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:50,833
I think I'm pregnant.

560
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:53,500
Okay...

561
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,708
It's been one day.

562
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,375
We can sense these things.

563
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,208
And I catch pregnant in no time too.

564
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,667
Roy and I had four abortions.

565
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,083
But I can't be a mother right now.

566
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,917
Of course you can't be a mother right now.

567
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:17,542
It's something you have to think about.

568
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:25,042
I just thought it would be nice,
since you're having one soon.

569
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:29,167
We could raise our kids together.

570
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:32,082
They'll go to kindergarten together...

571
01:08:32,707 --> 01:08:34,917
We'll take family vacations.

572
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,832
Maybe I should just go with it.

573
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:44,042
I think it's something
you have to be ready for.

574
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:46,000
Why, do you feel ready?
-Yes. I do.

575
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:53,000
Okay.

576
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:23,332
Hey.

577
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:22,083
Hello, thank you for contacting
the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality

578
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,917
through the 106 municipal services hotline.

579
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,750
To report a hazard...

580
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:30,625
Hi.

581
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:36,208
There's a tree outside my window
that the city just planted recently,

582
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,542
and there are two people leaning on it.

583
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:45,667
They might break it, could you send someone over?

584
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:54,750
(Speaking in Tigrinya)

585
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:11,833
Hey fellas, what are you doing?

586
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:14,208
Huh?
-We're not doing anything, man.

587
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,875
We've gotten complaints from people
from this street that you're causing trouble.

588
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:20,042
What trouble?
-There's no trouble, man.

589
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,542
Can I get your names?

590
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,292
What for? We're not doing anything.

591
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,583
Do you realise this is damage to
public property? You're breaking the tree.

592
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,917
I'm sorry.

593
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,792
You're breaking this tree,
you're damaging public property.

594
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,417
I understand.
-Don't lean on it, okay?

595
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:38,125
If I get another complaint,
I'll give you a ticket, so watch it.

596
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:39,917
You don't want that.
-You got it.

597
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,375
Hey!

598
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,792
What the hell is going on here?
-The situation's under control,

599
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,625
we got a complaint about property damage.
-What damage?

600
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,583
Sir...
-What damage? They're just standing here.

601
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,417
Sir, stay out of this.
-They haven't done anything!

602
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:56,750
Let me finish up here and close the case.
-I want you to tell me why you're harassing them.

603
01:11:56,792 --> 01:11:58,667
Sir, don't come near me, I'm warning you.
-Got nothing better to do than to harass them?

604
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,958
I'm a police officer.
-You think you scare me?

605
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,417
Do you, you jackbooted thug?
-Calm down.

606
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,625
You think you scare me?

607
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:07,000
I need backup...
-Sure, get backup. It's fine.

608
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:10,042
A man's acting up...
-What are you gonna do about it? Huh?

609
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,083
Watch it, you!

610
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:13,958
I have you on camera!

611
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,792
I have you on camera!

612
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,667
I have you on camera, you fucking fascist!

613
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:22,833
I have you on camera. We're going to
publicly shame you, you son of a bitch!

614
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:26,500
I have it all on camera, you asshole!

615
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:29,167
Fucking faggot.

616
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:32,000
Run, you coward!

617
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:51,375
Stay out of it, that's just my crazy neighbour.

618
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,042
I got it all on camera.
