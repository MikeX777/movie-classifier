1
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,825
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,194
(pensive music)

3
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,618
(bass thuds)

4
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,655
- [Annie Voiceover] This
is the story of a murder.

5
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,257
Several murders, in fact.

6
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,892
(bass thuds)

7
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,361
It begins with the
men in my life,

8
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,763
but don't think
it's a love story.

9
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,298
That was my first mistake.

10
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,400
(bass thuds)

11
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,202
In the end it's just
a little fairy tale

12
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,270
about feeling desperate,

13
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,906
and that's what
makes it my story.

14
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,210
I ran away from
home when I was 19.

15
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,446
When I met Bill, he was
the man of my dreams.

16
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,517
Bill used to say it was
love at first sight.

17
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,519
Love,

18
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,921
(glass crashes)

19
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,790
If that's we started with,

20
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,392
soon faded.

21
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,626
- Annie!

22
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,894
You left this door
open all night.

23
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,529
You know, somebody
coulda gotten in.

24
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,798
- Oh, I guess that storm the
other night must've warped it.

25
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,200
- Let's get it fixed, huh?

26
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,902
- I got something to tell you.

27
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,838
- Oh yeah? How 'bout telling
me what's for breakfast?

28
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,340
- Cereal.

29
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,974
- Don't they teach you how
to make a real breakfast

30
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,609
in that cooking class?

31
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,010
- [Annie] We haven't gotten
to breakfast yet, Bill.

32
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,912
- I thought you wanted
to learn how to cook.

33
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,981
- This cooking class
was your idea, remember?

34
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,816
- [Bill] So you don't
wanna learn how to cook?

35
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,784
- I didn't say that.

36
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,219
- [Bill] Good.

37
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,687
- I've got something
to tell you.

38
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,223
- 'Cause soggy flakes every
morning ain't cuttin' it.

39
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,490
- I got a job!

40
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,998
You know that grocery
store over by the freeway?

41
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, I was there the other day

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,368
and they were
hiring, so I thought,

43
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,304
why not go for an interview?

44
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,272
- Is that what you thought?

45
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,007
- Anyway, I got the job.

46
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,275
I can start Monday.

47
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,712
But I said I'd better check
with my husband first.

48
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,013
(Bill laughs)

49
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,282
- It's, that's, it's great,
honey. I'm proud of you.

50
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,918
Don't think I'm not proud
of you, 'cause I am.

51
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,253
It's just that, you
remember what happened

52
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,021
with that secretary
job last year?

53
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,889
All that phoning and faxing

54
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,058
and sitting at the
computer all day?

55
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,994
We never had a chance
to see each other.

56
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,297
Come on, you don't wanna go
through that again, now do you?

57
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,365
- No.

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,736
- Tell those losers over
at the grocery store,

59
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,437
you know, thanks a lot,

60
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,641
but you like it
here just fine, hmm?

61
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,575
Okay?
- Okay.

62
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,878
- (clucks) I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

63
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,048
- [Annie Voiceover] That's
where the trouble begins.

64
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,950
You're isolated.

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,318
Alone.

66
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,886
Murder could be the
last thing on your mind.

67
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,621
- 'Cause you married me
and you're stuck with me.

68
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,325
Like the man said, till
death do us part, baby.

69
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,393
(Bill snorts)

70
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,661
- [Annie Voiceover]
But every day

71
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,362
it gets harder and
harder to breath.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,366
(Bill choking)
The more suffocated you feel,

73
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,968
the more you wanna do somethin'.

74
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,636
- I'm okay.

75
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,340
- [Annie Voiceover]
I didn't run away

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,042
because sooner or later Bill
would end up killing me.

77
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,411
I ran away because
sooner or later

78
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,679
I knew that I'd let him.

79
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,916
That's what it's like
to be a prisoner.

80
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,118
All you can think about
is trying to escape.

81
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,088
You'll rely on
anything. Even luck.

82
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,325
You run for the sake of running.

83
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,493
You run even though
there's nowhere to go.

84
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,396
I almost made it, too.

85
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,501
But I always underestimate
how much Bill loves me.

86
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,604
You might say that he
more than loves me.

87
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,540
He needs me.

88
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,710
(sniffles) He'll be right out.

89
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,978
- Hey, Annie.
- Oh, Clark.

90
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,147
You scared me to
death. (sniffles)

91
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,116
- I'm sorry. Is Bill ready?

92
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,518
- Yeah, he'll be right down.

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,921
- You know, I haven't seen you

94
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,656
since the award
ceremony last month.

95
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,860
- Right. Congratulations,
by the way.

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,528
- On what?

97
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,165
- On being a hero, with Bill
and Beth and everything.

98
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,567
- Oh. Yeah.

99
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,602
- [Annie] Bill made me
have the picture framed.

100
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,404
You must be really proud.

101
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,905
- I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

102
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,375
- Yeah.

103
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,746
- You know, I'm gonna
wait by the car.

104
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,913
- Sorry, Clark.

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,084
Annie has us running a
little behind this morning.

106
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,719
Okay.

107
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,689
Honey, be sure to change
the fluids in the car, okay?

108
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,990
Annie?

109
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,625
- I'll take care of it.

110
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,893
- How you doin', man?

111
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,696
- [Annie Voiceover] So
there I was. Trapped.

112
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,098
No chance of divorce.

113
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,033
No life.

114
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,403
No way out.

115
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,805
- This is it?

116
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,673
- What do you mean?

117
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,674
- I mean...

118
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,010
What about a side dish?

119
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,780
How 'bout some sausage or bacon?

120
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,982
Since when does
anyone serve eggs

121
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,050
without some sorta side dish?

122
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,586
You know, I gotta be
honest with you, Annie,

123
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,723
it appears as if, by the
looks of this breakfast,

124
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,991
that you're not focusing

125
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,993
on the cooking aspects
of your cooking class.

126
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,231
How many men are in that class?

127
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,034
- I've told you a thousand
times, Bill, it's all women.

128
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,103
- You're cheating
on me, aren't you?

129
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,070
- I'm not cheating on you.

130
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,106
- Just listen to me.

131
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,576
You can tell me. You
don't have to lie.

132
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,243
- Bill-

133
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,244
(Annie gasps)

134
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,779
- What? You gonna cry?

135
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,848
You gonna cry like a crybaby?

136
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,550
Just remember
while you're crying

137
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,819
who saved you from that
freak called Daddy.

138
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,454
If I hadn't come along,

139
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,789
you'd still be taking baths
with that sick old fuck!

140
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,990
Without me you're nowhere!

141
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,525
- I just want to make you happy.

142
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,027
- Oh, you want to make me happy?

143
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,261
- Yes.

144
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,863
- Then how 'bout a
fuckin' side dish!

145
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,899
- [Annie Voiceover]
Which way do you turn

146
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,167
when there's no way out?

147
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,636
Which way do you turn?

148
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,271
- Ladies?

149
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,239
Gentlemen?

150
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,941
If I could have your attention,

151
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,242
I'd like to introduce you

152
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,478
to the newest
member of our class,

153
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,214
Mr. Thomas Nance.

154
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,515
- Ah...

155
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,283
Call me Tommy, please.

156
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,284
- Tommy it is.

157
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,888
(chef chuckles)
- Thank you.

158
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,490
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey, Annie.

159
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,525
How you doin'? Bill said
you'd be here tonight.

160
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,026
Then you realize you're
dying of boredom.

161
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,061
- Eh, it's not so bad.

162
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,296
- (laughs) Yeah, right.

163
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,698
So what are you doin' here?

164
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,500
I told Mike that if
he learned how to cook

165
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,201
I'd be his sex
slave forever, so...

166
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,303
(Annie giggles)

167
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,005
Oh, I get it.

168
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,874
Bill gets a little
variety in his menu,

169
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,809
so you get a little
variety in yours.

170
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,043
- No!
- Yes!

171
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,245
I saw you checkin' that guy out.

172
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,247
- No!
- Well, I don't blame you.

173
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,749
I'd kinda like to
peel his potato.

174
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,317
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

175
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,123
- You need a partner?

176
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,025
I could use all the
help I could get.

177
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,128
You know, to be
perfectly honest,

178
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,999
I've always been a miserable
failure at side dishes.

179
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,568
How 'bout you?

180
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,004
- Me too.

181
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,573
- I didn't get your name.

182
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,275
- Annie.

183
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:04,176
- That's pretty.

184
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,280
- [Teacher] All right. Now,
tonight we're going to focus-

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,581
- Oh.

186
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,282
- [Teacher] On a
plethora of side dishes.

187
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,050
- It's starting.

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,084
- [Teacher] Okay,
first I want you all

189
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,719
to break into partners.

190
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,123
- Goodnight, Annie.

191
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,357
- Goodnight, Beth.

192
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,226
- [Tommy] May I walk
you to your car?

193
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,629
- I don't know.

194
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,966
- Who's your friend?

195
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,571
- Beth? Oh, she works
with my husband Bill.

196
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,371
- Isn't she a cop?

197
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,174
- How do you know?

198
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,776
- Teacher must've mentioned it.

199
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,046
- [Annie] So you cook?

200
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,681
- A lotta men cook.

201
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,815
- Not the men I know.

202
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,050
- Oh, so you're saying

203
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,619
maybe I have an ulterior
motive for being here?

204
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,620
- No! I-
- Like maybe I'm here

205
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,821
to pick up girls or something?

206
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,090
- No!
(Tommy laughs)

207
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,992
- It just so happens that
I travel a lot in my work

208
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,661
and after a while
every restaurant starts
to taste the same.

209
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,264
- Where do your
travels take you?

210
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,400
- Oh, Europe, South America.

211
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,902
Last year I went to China.

212
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,803
- China?

213
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,672
- Would you like to go to China?

214
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,707
- No, I...

215
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,709
Well, I'd kinda
like to go anywhere.

216
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:12,945
This is mine.

217
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,114
- This is mine.

218
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,018
- So you're not cooking,
what do you do for a living?

219
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,052
- May I take your picture?

220
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:20,987
- What?

221
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,622
- [Tommy] What's your last name?

222
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,423
- Summers.
(shutter clicks)

223
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,691
- [Tommy] Annie Summers.

224
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,027
- How do I look?

225
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,196
(shutter clicks)

226
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,330
- Lonely.

227
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,765
(shutter clicks)

228
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,400
- [Annie] Hmm.

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,735
- Sorry.

230
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,437
(Annie laughs)

231
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,305
What?

232
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,374
- I just can't
remember the last time

233
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,376
a man apologized to me.

234
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,378
- [Tommy] I'll have to
do it more often then.

235
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,647
- You never answered
my question.

236
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,415
- [Tommy] What
question was that?

237
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,250
- What is it that you do.

238
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,718
- For a living?
- Yes.

239
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,719
- I kill people.

240
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,724
(Annie chuckles)

241
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,660
(Tommy laughs)

242
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,827
- [Annie] What do you really do?

243
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,130
- Ah, photographer.

244
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,798
I'm doing a project on suburbia.

245
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,103
- What would you say if I
asked to take your picture?

246
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,774
(pensive music)

247
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,747
- How do I look?

248
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,018
- You look lonely too.

249
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,792
(shutter clicks)

250
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,761
- I guess you're
looking pretty forward

251
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,730
to your cooking class tonight.

252
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,732
You got home pretty
late last time.

253
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,967
- I got home around
the usual time.

254
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,769
- [Bill] You came home at 10:30.

255
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,271
Usual time's 10 o'clock.

256
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,405
- We must've run late.

257
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,406
- We?

258
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,474
- I must've run late.

259
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,912
- Honey, you don't
get home on time,

260
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,047
I worry about you.

261
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,396
- Clark?

262
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,765
- Annie, hi.

263
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,135
I didn't think Bill ever
let you out of the house.

264
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,771
- Oh, well, I sneak
out once in a while.

265
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,908
Didn't expect to see you here.

266
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,143
- Yeah, well...

267
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,781
It's my day off and I figured
I'd better stock my kitchen.

268
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,750
- Well, doesn't Sarah
do your cooking?

269
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,753
- Yeah. Yeah, she did.

270
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:35,487
- Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:41,160
- Well, apparently I'm
too boring. (chuckles)

272
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,064
The fact that I'm a lousy
cook didn't help either.

273
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,833
- Well, I guess

274
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,471
it's not as easy as we thought
to find the right person.

275
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,774
- Yeah, well, we
all make mistakes.

276
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,812
Listen.

277
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,347
Bill and I go back
to high school

278
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,049
and I know he's not a
prince or anything...

279
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,987
(Clark sighs)

280
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,590
Look, I don't wanna
step on any toes,

281
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,059
but I know people
who could help you.

282
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,365
- I called the police
twice last year.

283
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,368
I guess when it
comes to protection,

284
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,903
they start with their own.

285
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,172
So I appreciate your concern,

286
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,973
but there's really
nothing you can do.

287
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,444
(ominous music)

288
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,181
(phone ringing)

289
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,616
- Hello?

290
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:37,649
- Hey, Beth, it's Annie.

291
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,853
Do you know if Bill is
working late tonight?

292
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,222
- Uh, yeah. He was just typing
up a report when I left.

293
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,456
- Oh, I guess I'll
just leave his dinner

294
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,558
in the fridge then.

295
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,259
- Hmm. Look, stop
worrying so much.

296
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,494
And don't be late for class,

297
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,562
'cause it's soup
and salad night.

298
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,564
(muffled gunshot cracks)

299
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,199
Yeah.

300
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,466
- [Woman on TV] Why
are we moving so fast?

301
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,635
- Mikey! Honey, can
you turn the TV down?

302
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,571
Mike?
- [TV] Let go of me! Please!

303
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,906
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

304
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,541
(ominous music)

305
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,009
You're hurting me!
(Beth gasps)

306
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,977
Help! Help!

307
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,914
(woman on TV screams)

308
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,650
- Now, the first step
in preparing the souffle

309
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,253
is a very challenging one.

310
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,622
Again, crack your egg
on the side of the bowl.

311
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,924
Good.

312
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,026
Now tip the egg to one side

313
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,196
and carefully pass the yolk

314
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,932
from one half of the
shell into the other.

315
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,667
And there, you see?

316
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:30,669
It's easy.

317
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:31,937
- (laughs) You did it.

318
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,174
- Not without making
a mess in the process.

319
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,648
Sorry.

320
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,916
If I lost this,

321
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,653
you never would've forgiven me.

322
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,322
(soft music)

323
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,495
- [Teacher] Has anyone
seen Beth tonight?

324
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,230
You sure?

325
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,305
- [Annie] Where were we?

326
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,239
- My parents.

327
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,177
Pretty much raised myself. I
did some time in the military.

328
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,479
That's where I started
to get interested

329
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,680
in photographing things.

330
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,581
What about you?

331
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,686
- Oh, my mom died when I was 12

332
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,590
and my dad, well, I think
he's alive somewhere.

333
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,993
We didn't really get
along, so I ran away.

334
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,496
That's when I met Bill.

335
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,098
- Coffee and one peach pie.

336
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,500
- Thank you.
- Anything else?

337
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,935
- No.
- Okay.

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,002
If you need anything
else, just gimme a holler.

339
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,070
- Thanks.

340
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,408
May I ask you something?

341
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,376
- Sure.
- What would your husband do

342
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,978
if you lost your wedding ring?

343
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,015
Would he hurt you?

344
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,453
Ah...

345
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
Look, I'm sorry. It's
none of my business.

346
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,757
- No, and it's, um,

347
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,759
it's not your problem.

348
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,994
I, uh...

349
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,130
I really,

350
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,065
I really should get going.

351
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,000
- If somebody's hurting you,

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,201
they should be stopped.

353
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,139
(somber music)

354
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,241
- Sometimes he hits me.

355
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,344
- [Tommy] Sometimes?

356
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,247
- A lot.

357
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,749
- Have you gone to the police?

358
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
- [Annie] Twice. But
they can't do anything.

359
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,494
- Well, maybe I could
offer another alternative.

360
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,064
I knew a woman

361
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,800
who went through the same things

362
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,736
you're going through
with her husband.

363
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,007
- What did she do?

364
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,043
- [Tommy] She had him killed.

365
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,014
- How?

366
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,548
- You don't wanna know.

367
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,750
- [Annie] I do.

368
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:57,783
- Pretty terrible.

369
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,555
She had him decapitated
with an axe.

370
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,825
- Oh my god.
- While he was sleeping.

371
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,595
- That's so

372
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,563
Perfect.

373
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,666
- See, I'm glad
you feel that way.

374
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,436
I told her... (laughs)

375
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,439
I said, don't do it like
that. It's so messy.

376
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,076
You see, my motto is
keep things simple.

377
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,844
Do your homework, carefully.

378
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,417
The rest is, ah,
execution, so to speak.

379
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,253
(brooding music)

380
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,788
- What happened to the woman?

381
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,790
- I don't know.

382
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,128
I'd like to think that she
lived happily ever after.

383
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,435
- [Annie] So where do you
stay while you're in town?

384
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,070
- Oh, I have this place downtown

385
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,104
I like to stay at
whenever I'm here.

386
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,772
- Uh-huh. Hotel?

387
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,074
- No, that's too public.

388
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,110
I do business here more and more

389
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,411
so I finally rented a place.

390
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,280
It's really nice.

391
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,451
You oughta come visit sometime.
Do you ever get downtown?

392
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,853
- No, you know. My husband.

393
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,089
- Ah.

394
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,660
You know, in China they have
this saying about women:

395
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,096
"She can live the
life of a prisoner,

396
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,231
she can live the
life of a princess,

397
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,600
or she could be herself."

398
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,170
(pensive music)

399
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,646
Which one are you?

400
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,617
- Oh, this is getting confusing.

401
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,586
- No. This is getting exciting.

402
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,792
(crickets chirping)

403
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,141
- [Bill] You coulda called.

404
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,709
I was getting ideas.

405
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,645
- I...

406
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:06,678
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,949
I stayed late to help clean up.

408
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:14,620
- (laughs) I don't want you
going to that class anymore.

409
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,623
- Bill.

410
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,162
- I know I didn't turn out
the way you wanted me to.

411
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,197
And I know I'm not perfect.

412
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,599
(cylinder clicking)

413
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,235
But you don't have
to go cheat on me.

414
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,537
- I'm not.

415
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,571
- Don't lie to me.

416
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,173
- Bill!

417
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,341
Just give it to me.

418
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,244
(ominous music)

419
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,415
Take it.

420
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,384
Before I do something
stupid with it.

421
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,352
(Annie gasps)

422
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,453
- No, Bill! Bill!

423
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,888
- Who is it?
- No! No one, please!

424
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,923
- Who is it?
- No one!

425
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:51,924
- You're killing me!

426
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,892
(Annie screams)
(hammer clicks)

427
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,295
(Bill sobs)

428
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,670
Just don't go to
that class anymore.

429
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,307
I don't want you going
to that class, okay?

430
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,710
- Murder-suicide. It's
the third one this year.

431
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,245
Excuse me.

432
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,647
Husband takes her out, then
he sits in his favorite chair

433
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,316
and turns the gun on himself.

434
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,218
Did you know him?

435
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,853
- No, not enough
to explain this.

436
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,290
- It's tough. I
gotta take a piss.

437
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,592
You wanna finish this?

438
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,694
- No thanks.

439
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,997
(police radio chatter)

440
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,269
(bell chimes)

441
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,037
- [Waitress] Here you go.

442
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,775
- Thanks for meeting me.

443
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,812
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am.

444
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,615
I had to wait for Bill
to leave for work.

445
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,650
- [Tommy] Well, you sounded
so upset on the phone.

446
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,051
- Yeah, well, uh...

447
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,288
I can't come to class anymore.

448
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,625
I wanted to say goodbye
to you face to face.

449
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,527
I didn't want you to
think I was mad at you.

450
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,665
- You could leave him.

451
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,900
- He'd find me.

452
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,902
- [Tommy] You could run away.

453
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,837
- I've got nowhere to go.

454
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,038
- You could come with me.

455
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,575
Annie.

456
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,511
Come away with me.

457
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,883
- I don't even know you.

458
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:25,951
- You know enough.

459
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,588
I'll be leaving soon.

460
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,593
I want you to go with me.

461
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,529
I want to take care of you.

462
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,431
It's simpler than
you think, Annie.

463
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,634
One day you wake up,

464
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,703
you're someplace new,

465
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,805
someplace beautiful.

466
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,308
No Bill.

467
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,576
Just you and me.

468
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,681
(brooding music)

469
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,686
- I can't.

470
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,055
- I can.

471
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,328
- I can't.

472
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,899
I can't.

473
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,368
Goodbye.

474
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,439
(ominous music)

475
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,412
(Zippo clinks)

476
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,362
(floorboard creaks)

477
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,700
Bill?

478
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,174
Bill?

479
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:00,912
Bill?

480
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,016
You're home early.

481
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,452
- Daddy was right.

482
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,992
Give the bitch an inch

483
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,861
and she'll rip your
fuckin' arm off.

484
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,596
- What's wrong?

485
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,700
- I had a bad day today.

486
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,537
Beth's dead.

487
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:29,908
- What?

488
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,412
- [Bill] Mike killed her.

489
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,146
- What?

490
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,549
- I came home to tell you,

491
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,684
but you weren't here.

492
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,455
So I went looking for you.

493
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,426
(ominous music)

494
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,231
Get off my fuckin' bed.

495
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,769
(belt buckle rattles)

496
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,937
- Bill, no!

497
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,771
No!

498
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,039
- [Bill] Let go of that!

499
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,507
Let it go! Who is he?
- No, Bill! Please!

500
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,875
- Who, you bitch?

501
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,843
Fucking bitch!

502
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,211
- [Annie] No! Stop it, Bill!

503
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,046
No! (screams)

504
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,114
- Who is it?

505
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,216
Who is it?

506
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,517
- [Annie] No! No!

507
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,985
Please!

508
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,855
(thunder rumbles)

509
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,524
- [Clark] Hey, you
got my messages?

510
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,459
- You forgot your faxes again.

511
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,726
- Hey, I'm sorry.

512
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,496
- Try checking your
box once in a while?

513
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,232
(ominous music)

514
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,473
(man whistles)

515
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,542
(mouths silently)

516
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,683
- Damn.

517
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,531
Annie?

518
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,566
Annie?

519
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,969
- Hi, Clark.

520
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,837
- Oh my god.

521
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,240
- [Annie] It's gonna be okay.

522
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,744
- I want you to take this.

523
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,818
And you use it if you need me.

524
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:23,855
Take it.

525
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,993
(Annie moans softly)

526
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,795
(brooding music)

527
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:40,639
(distant bell tolls)
(thunder rumbles)

528
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,214
(rain pattering)

529
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,083
- You won't have to do anything.

530
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,053
- There's nothing you can do.

531
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,289
- I know.

532
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,356
I understand.

533
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,628
You're the first person
the police would look to.

534
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,598
(suspenseful music)

535
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,568
Whatever happens, it has
to look like an accident.

536
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,671
Tell me more about
Bill. His routine.

537
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,576
He leaves for work
about 9:30, doesn't he?

538
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,811
- [Annie] Every morning.
How did you know?

539
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,948
- [Tommy] I guess his day's
probably spent patrolling, huh?

540
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,583
Answering calls for help?

541
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,917
- [Annie] That's right!

542
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,786
- [Tommy] Pretty
high-pressure stuff.

543
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,921
If you wouldn't mind,

544
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,289
I'd like to come by
your house tomorrow.

545
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:31,322
- [Annie] Why?

546
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:35,060
- [Tommy] Just to visit. Check
in, see how you're doing.

547
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,895
- [Annie] Oh! You, you can't.

548
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,597
What if Bill came home?

549
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,365
- [Tommy] It would only
be for a few minutes.

550
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,766
- [Annie] No, I,

551
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,369
I can't allow that.

552
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,037
- Doesn't this door close?

553
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:46,070
- It's warped. What...

554
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,108
I told you not to come here!
- How are you feeling?

555
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,309
Better?

556
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,745
(foreboding music)

557
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,746
- You have to leave!

558
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,615
- A very nice neighborhood.

559
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,382
It's a little
quiet for my taste,

560
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,384
but I think it's perfect.

561
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,319
May I use your bathroom?

562
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,253
- What if Bill comes home?

563
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,289
- [Tommy] Are you expecting him?

564
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,156
- No.

565
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,993
- Do you know what ZTA is?

566
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,427
Using the proper dosage,

567
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,763
it can cause unconsciousness
for about 30 minutes.

568
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,065
See, but the trick is to
use enough to be effective

569
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,867
and still not enough
to be detected later,

570
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,801
you know what I mean?

571
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,036
God, you look pretty today.

572
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,807
I just wanted to come by and
make sure everything was okay.

573
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,410
- I'm fine.

574
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,712
- I wish there was more
I could do for you.

575
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,782
- You've already done so much.

576
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,652
- Not yet.

577
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,791
But I will.

578
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,168
- I appreciate what
you're saying, you know.

579
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,469
I really do.

580
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,072
But everything's under
control. It's all right.

581
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,307
- I saw her.

582
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,743
I saw her face.

583
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,781
- Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.

584
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,184
(phone rings)

585
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,488
You know, there's something
my daddy always told me.

586
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,223
Good advice.

587
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,825
He said, "You want to
keep your good friends?

588
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,226
Stay out of their bedrooms."

589
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:15,259
- Look, Bill, all I'm saying is

590
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:19,264
if you're having trouble then
you should talk to somebody.

591
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,699
You can talk to me, talk to her,

592
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,767
but you gotta talk
to somebody, man.

593
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,935
- Is she talking to you?

594
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,370
- No-
- No, is she talking to you?

595
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:26,170
- Listen to me now.

596
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,873
If she's talking to you, she's
giving you half the story.

597
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,341
Did she tell you
she's cheating on me?

598
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,143
- Whether she is or
not is irrelevant.

599
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,912
You're beating on your wife

600
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,715
and you need to
check yourself, man.

601
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,150
(police chattering)

602
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,720
(phone rings)

603
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,793
(Bill sighs)

604
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,466
- [Bill] Okay.

605
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:11,382
(crickets chirping)
(wind chimes ring softly)

606
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:15,253
(foreboding music)

607
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,896
(dial tone hums)

608
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,799
(phone beeping)

609
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,503
(line ringing)

610
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,039
(phone rings)

611
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,543
(ominous music)

612
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,447
(phone ringing)

613
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,588
Where are you goin'?

614
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,793
You wanna go to your
cooking class, don't you?

615
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,427
- Yes.

616
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,563
I know you're gonna be mad-

617
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,431
- No, listen, it's okay.

618
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,933
- Tonight's the
final exam and I,

619
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,802
I really have to go.

620
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,810
What's that?

621
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,877
- Well, it's

622
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,081
just a little somethin' I
grabbed for you on the way home.

623
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,052
- You bought me flowers?

624
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:23,922
- Yeah.

625
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,456
- Um...

626
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,596
There's chicken and potatoes
in the oven for you.

627
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,431
- It smells good. (chuckles)

628
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,466
- [Annie] Yeah. It has pesto.

629
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,135
- What? What-so?

630
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,205
- Pesto. It's kind
of a seasoning.

631
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,841
You mix it up with potatoes.
It makes a great side dish.

632
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,976
- Sounds like pretty
complicated stuff.

633
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,244
You sure you can't stay?

634
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,912
I mean, there's a
ballgame on tonight.

635
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,114
I figured we'd take
it in together.

636
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,349
- I'll be home soon.

637
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,218
I promise.

638
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,621
- Oh yeah, okay.

639
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,989
I'm not goin' anywhere.

640
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,936
(crowd cheering)

641
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:45,970
- [Announcer] And
knocks the ball away.

642
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,171
A well-timed leap-

643
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,940
- It should be seamless.
- He's a nice man.

644
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,275
- Well, you know,

645
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,409
I guess you just never
really know about people.

646
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,710
Well! Look who's back.
- I'm sorry.

647
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,245
- I'd just about
given up on you.

648
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,014
- I'm sorry I'm late.
Have you seen Tommy?

649
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,083
- Nope, not tonight. Maybe
he's late too, I don't know.

650
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,520
- [Announcer] And Best
makes the second free throw.

651
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,356
(door creaks)

652
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,158
- [Announcer] What
was he last year? 62%?

653
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,593
- [Announcer] 62%, that's right.

654
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,962
And give a little of that
credit to a fine coaching staff.

655
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,597
- [Announcer] Exactly,
yeah, and the fact also

656
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,266
that the team's intact
from last season.

657
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,968
(TV volume lowers)

658
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,936
- [Announcer] When you know
how to play with each other

659
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,404
as much as these guys, you know,

660
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,005
experience builds confidence.

661
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,974
- [Announcer] Okay,
Hazle comes in with 3:15-

662
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:23,741
- [Bill] Annie?

663
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,377
- [Announcer] Evans is out.

664
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,179
15 on the shot clock.

665
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,480
- [Bill] Annie?

666
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,316
- [Announcer] He skies
to finger-roll it in

667
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,318
and it's down by seven.

668
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,354
(dog barking)

669
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,324
(wind chimes ringing softly)

670
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,693
- [Announcer] Much respect
for his outside shooting.

671
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,294
- [Announcer] Right now
he's forced Adams to commit.

672
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,963
Here comes Delwood
to pick him up,

673
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,731
leaving Richards free for
the easy pick-and-roll.

674
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,534
Nice pass from *. Very good.

675
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,302
And Michaels dribbles
across the time line.

676
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,438
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

677
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,273
Now rewarding him,
takes and drives.

678
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,075
Reverse layup
blocked by Delwood.

679
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,444
(dog barks)

680
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,449
(TV announcers chattering)

681
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,055
Sure it is. Tough defense
is what it's all about.

682
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,391
Delwood intimidates Donovan
into a difficult shot,

683
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,726
he knocks the ball away.

684
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,328
Double-times it, leak right,
Adams blindsiding Dawson,

685
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,430
leaving the possible
three-point play.

686
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,599
Oh! It's a bad foul there.

687
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,533
Yeah, he should've just taken-

688
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,168
(air whooshing)

689
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,437
Now Christie's taken
out and Kennedy is in.

690
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,775
Stewart makes the free
throw. They're down by two.

691
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,746
Coming in is Evans for Mike
Lewis. He's got 14 points.

692
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,315
(tense music)
(students chattering)

693
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,051
(phone rings)

694
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,591
(line rings)

695
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,026
(coin rattles)

696
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,595
(ominous music)

697
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,170
(line rings)

698
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,141
(phone ringing)

699
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:09,213
(faucet running)
(phone ringing)

700
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,152
(ominous music)

701
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,256
(water splashing)

702
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,793
(phone ringing)

703
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,662
(phone ringing)

704
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,797
- I'm comin'.

705
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,869
(shutter clicks)

706
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,373
(body thuds)

707
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,545
(tense music)

708
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,185
(TV announcers chattering)

709
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,498
(engine cranks)

710
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,101
(tires squeal)

711
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,104
(chilling music)

712
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,412
(Bill screams)

713
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,752
(crickets chirping)

714
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,489
(Bill groaning)

715
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,402
(Bill grunts)

716
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,706
(Bill laughs hoarsely)

717
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,377
(Bill shouting)

718
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,515
(tires screech)

719
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,351
(dramatic music)

720
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,388
- No!

721
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,459
(blood splatters)

722
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,930
(tense music)

723
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,476
(Bill grunting)

724
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,585
- Annie.

725
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,291
- I told you I'd save you.

726
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,562
(gunshot cracks)

727
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,967
(heartbeat thumping)

728
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,804
(TV announcers chattering)

729
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,878
(heartbeat thumping slowly)

730
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,471
(clock ticking)

731
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,613
(distant traffic honking)

732
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,326
(soft jazz music)

733
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,265
(dishes clink)

734
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,301
Hungry?

735
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,311
- Where's Bill?

736
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,315
- I made crepes. Just like
the ones we made in class.

737
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,485
Fresh-squeezed orange juice.

738
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,421
And look what I
found at the market.

739
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,524
Strawberries.

740
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,464
It's what you wanted.

741
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,534
- Where are my clothes?

742
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,704
- Everything will
be all right now.

743
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,706
- I need my clothes!

744
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,775
- You can do anything you want.

745
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,679
- Don't say that.
- You'll be safe with me.

746
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,349
- [Annie] I have to go back!

747
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,650
- You mean leave?

748
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,517
- Yes!

749
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,920
- Leave me?

750
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,655
- Yes!

751
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,027
- Fine.

752
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,995
Fine.

753
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,063
Whatever you want.

754
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,669
(dial tone hums)

755
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,171
Wanna turn yourself in?

756
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,072
Be my guest.

757
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,448
- You had a knife.

758
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,152
- Your knife.

759
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,887
Your fingerprints.

760
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,423
Your home.

761
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,159
Your marriage.

762
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,129
- But you...

763
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,463
- I wasn't even there.

764
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,867
You can't go back, Annie.

765
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,169
(brooding music)

766
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,504
Why would you want to?

767
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,542
Please.

768
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,646
Yes.

769
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,890
(dark, pensive music)

770
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,530
Drink it. Please?

771
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,577
Is it good?

772
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,212
- [Annie] Mm-hmm.

773
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,681
- I got a surprise for you.

774
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,660
- What is it?

775
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,562
- [Tommy] A present.

776
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,688
As long as you're with me you
have nothing to worry about.

777
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,191
Nothing at all.

778
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,828
- We have a corpse.

779
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,263
We have a knife
wound in the abdomen,

780
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,699
not to mention a gunshot
wound in the chest.

781
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,567
What we don't got is a wife.

782
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,903
Call me a novice, but
I think it's a safe bet

783
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,539
that the prints we pull
from said .38 and said knife

784
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,140
are gonna fit her like a glove.

785
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,143
You knew her, didn't ya?

786
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,514
- We spoke a few times.

787
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,314
- You were friends?

788
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:00,985
- Not really, no.

789
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,725
- Bill's car's in the garage.

790
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,561
- So if both cars are here,
then how'd she get away?

791
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,664
- On foot? I don't know.

792
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,934
- Maybe with someone else.

793
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,537
- Look, Clark, I got
murder in the first

794
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,305
with a vicious fuckin' intent.

795
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,241
You got a theory about your
friend, fine, give her a call,

796
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,111
but don't her fuckin' husband
to answer because he ain't in.

797
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,616
(soft, pensive music)

798
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,862
- Would you like to go away?

799
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,299
- Where?

800
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,868
- China. We leave in 48 hours.

801
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,077
You miss him?

802
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,181
Are you sorry he's dead?

803
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,386
(Tommy sighs)

804
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,290
This is my last job, Annie.

805
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,962
All I want now is you.

806
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,665
(pensive music)

807
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,797
(shutter clicking)

808
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,480
(rain pattering)

809
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,954
(thunder rumbles)

810
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:16,346
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

811
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,144
- The search continues
for a Santa Clara woman

812
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,781
whose husband was found
brutally murdered in his house.

813
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,449
Santa Clara police
are looking everywhere

814
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,519
for the wife of the victim,
who has all but disappeared.

815
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,755
The victim was a
local police officer,

816
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,123
best known for his involvement

817
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,925
in what has become known
as the doll shop drug raid

818
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,028
that caused major damage
and subsequently shut down

819
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,897
a large South American
drug operation

820
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,133
known as the Buena
Ventura cartel.

821
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:15,773
(rain pattering)
(thunder rumbles)

822
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,316
(somber music)

823
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,075
- Nine months ago I got a tip

824
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,945
that a doll factory
was using slave labor.

825
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,182
Bill and Beth check it
out. Only, surprise-

826
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,383
- Yeah, I know, I know.

827
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,617
And they were making
heroin instead of dolls

828
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,952
and you guys are heroes.

829
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,220
You put the Buena Vista cartel

830
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,588
out of business
for a couple weeks.

831
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,589
- Buena Ventura.

832
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,157
- [Polito] Whatever.

833
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,059
- Bill and Beth are dead.

834
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,561
- So you think maybe
the Buena Adventure

835
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,929
put out a hit on Bill and Beth?

836
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,865
- Two domestic
killings involving cops

837
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,600
who both took part
in bringing down-

838
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,835
- Bill's no hit.

839
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,305
Professional hits don't
normally use a kitchen knife.

840
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,108
You don't think the wife did it.

841
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,513
- I don't know.

842
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,184
(haunting music)

843
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:11,655
- I miss ya, honey.

844
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,657
(spoon clinking)

845
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,092
I'll never let you go.

846
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,928
(gunshot cracks)

847
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,696
(chilling music)

848
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:23,033
(chimes ring softly)

849
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:31,942
(keyboard clicking)
(soft jazz music)

850
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,932
(dishes clatter)

851
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,177
(shower running)

852
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,572
(ominous music)

853
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,170
- Good morning.

854
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,541
Sleep well?

855
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,221
I know it's confusing.

856
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,659
You can't go back.
Your husband's gone.

857
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,096
And as far as the
police are concerned,

858
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,097
I don't even exist.

859
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,134
(distant siren wails)

860
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,408
It'll be over soon.

861
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,745
And we can go away.

862
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,351
And we can forget any
of this ever happened.

863
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,856
(chilling music)

864
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,158
(Annie yelping)

865
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:35,892
- Don't!

866
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:41,431
Don't!
- It's all right!

867
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,866
Stop!

868
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,102
(soft, brooding music)

869
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,369
It's all right.

870
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,773
Everything is
gonna be all right.

871
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,311
(Annie breathing heavily)

872
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,180
(chains rattle)

873
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,125
There, you see? Plenty of room.

874
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,627
You can go anywhere you like.

875
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,297
- What if I want to leave?

876
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,500
- [Tommy] Every relationship
has its boundaries.

877
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,370
- Are you...

878
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,572
Are you gonna kill Clark?

879
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,474
- I have to make arrangements
for your passport.

880
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,909
Tomorrow morning
we leave for good.

881
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,144
- Tommy?

882
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,383
Have you ever killed
anyone you loved?

883
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,427
(brooding music)

884
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,369
(motor whirs)

885
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,238
(engine cranks)

886
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,854
(chain rattles)

887
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,606
(Annie grunts)

888
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,243
(somber music)

889
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,552
(Annie groans)

890
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,230
(pensive music)

891
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:18,288
(suspenseful music)

892
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:38,441
(jars clinking)

893
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,011
(tense music)

894
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,335
- [Tommy Voiceover] Do
you know what ZTA is?

895
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,770
Using a proper dosage,

896
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,606
it can cause unconsciousness
for about 30 minutes.

897
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,875
See, but the trick is to
use enough to be effective

898
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,644
and still not enough
to be detected later.

899
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,447
(brooding music)

900
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:24,954
- So.

901
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,426
They found another set
of prints at Bill's.

902
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,327
- Whose?

903
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,361
- Yours.

904
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,431
You go there a lot?

905
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,632
- No.

906
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,733
I mean, I've picked
him up for work

907
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:37,901
every once in a while.

908
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,337
- Ever seen this?

909
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,873
- [Tommy] Sure.

910
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,042
- [Polito] You and Bill go back.

911
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:46,943
- So?

912
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,347
- Why don't you tell me what
happened here the other day.

913
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,583
- That was personal.

914
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,054
- Anything to do with the wife?

915
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,393
(Clark sighs)

916
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,527
- He was beating her.

917
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:06,730
- So she killed him.

918
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,567
- No. No, I don't think so.

919
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:12,669
- Then who did?

920
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,140
(police chattering)

921
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,146
- Are you calling me a suspect?

922
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,556
(distant traffic honking)

923
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,438
(garage door clanks)

924
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,509
(gate clangs)

925
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,449
(motor whirring)

926
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,859
(chain rattling)

927
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,772
(elevator clangs)

928
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,241
(gate thuds)

929
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,247
(silverware clinks)

930
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,983
(keys jingle)

931
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:38,988
- Annie?

932
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,773
(cuffs click)

933
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,744
(chain rattles)

934
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,581
Do you forgive me?

935
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,484
- Yes.

936
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,556
- Will you go away with me?

937
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:15,625
- [Annie] Yes.

938
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,496
- Really?

939
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,502
- I'm sorry about before.

940
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,203
I should've trust you.

941
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,639
I know you were only looking
out for our best interests.

942
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,187
- What's this?

943
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:46,556
- I made us lunch.

944
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,059
(cork pops)

945
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,962
(soft jazz music)

946
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,050
How is it?

947
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:27,897
- Delicious.

948
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:29,899
- Good.

949
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,339
Tell me about China.

950
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,943
- What do you want to know?

951
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:40,944
- Oh, um...

952
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,880
Where will we stay?

953
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,082
- Well, we'd have to find
a place to live first.

954
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,786
They have residence permits
that are called hukou.

955
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,755
They're difficult to get, but...

956
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:57,093
Especially for
women. (chuckling)

957
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:57,994
We'll get one.

958
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,666
- Will you be finished
with your work tonight?

959
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:07,837
- Yes.

960
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,882
(ominous music)

961
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:31,227
(Tommy groans)

962
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,395
(both shout)

963
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,064
(dishes crash)

964
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:39,435
(Annie screams)

965
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,138
(tense music)

966
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,142
(keys jingle)

967
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,178
(suspenseful music)

968
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,086
(Tommy shouts)

969
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,789
(Annie shrieks)

970
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:06,095
(elevator clangs)

971
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,699
(Annie screams)

972
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,469
(Tommy shouts)

973
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,473
(Tommy shouts)

974
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:23,112
(Annie panting)

975
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,253
(motor whirs)

976
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,966
(elevator thuds)

977
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,836
(Annie panting)

978
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,244
(gate clangs)

979
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,920
(elevator rumbling)

980
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:12,495
(ominous music)

981
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,364
(keys jingling)

982
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,270
(elevator groans)

983
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,906
(gate rattles)

984
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,978
(Annie yelps)

985
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,217
(chain rattles)

986
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,052
- [Annie] Are you
gonna kill Clark?

987
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,922
- Changed the reservations.

988
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,024
We leave tonight.

989
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,327
Then tomorrow we start over.

990
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,931
You got a problem with that?

991
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:23,966
- No.

992
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,311
(light buzzing softly)

993
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,223
(ominous music)

994
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,958
(suspenseful music)

995
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,537
(Annie grunts)

996
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,107
(wrench squeaks)

997
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,676
(Annie gasps)

998
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,701
- Little elves down at
the lab found a surprise

999
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,070
in the blood samples
gathered at the scene.

1000
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,941
Lab results confirmed
the blood of the victim

1001
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,943
along with the blood
of someone else.

1002
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:15,912
- Annie?

1003
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,348
- I already checked
her out. She's type O.

1004
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,450
Found type A and
type B at the scene.

1005
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,288
Bill's type A.

1006
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:32,295
- I'm type B.

1007
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,299
- So far I'm the
only one that knows.

1008
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,102
In the meantime I'm having
forensics run a comparison

1009
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,939
between your blood and the
blood found at the scene.

1010
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,408
You got a problem with that?

1011
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,744
- No.

1012
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,147
- The way I see it, we got
three questions left to answer.

1013
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,583
If the blood found at the scene
is not yours, whose is it?

1014
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,053
What does Annie
have to do with it?

1015
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:57,954
And where is she?

1016
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,326
(pensive music)

1017
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,300
(keyboard clicking)

1018
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,716
- Going home?
- Yeah.

1019
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,184
- Forgot your faxes again.

1020
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,052
- Sorry.
- Try and check your box

1021
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:30,753
once in a while.
- I most certainly will.

1022
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,722
Thank you. Thank you.

1023
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,648
(foreboding music)

1024
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,425
(microwave beeps)

1025
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,112
(shotgun cocks)

1026
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,849
(haunting music)

1027
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,319
- Why are you smiling?

1028
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,689
- How do I plan on doing it?

1029
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,125
- How do you mean?

1030
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,794
- My suicide.

1031
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,700
Messy.

1032
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,569
- You'll be sitting
when it happens.

1033
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,107
- What if I don't want to sit?

1034
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,243
- You'll be standing
when it happens.

1035
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:39,849
Shall I assume it's loaded?

1036
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,749
- You shall.

1037
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,288
May I ask you a question first?

1038
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,125
- [Tommy] What?

1039
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,595
- Where is she?

1040
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,496
- [Tommy] Who?

1041
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:55,698
- Annie.

1042
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,769
Oh, you didn't know
about us, did you?

1043
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,640
Well, she tells me everything.

1044
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:06,942
Every

1045
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,478
intimate detail.

1046
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,148
- Anything about me?

1047
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,718
- Well, let me think.

1048
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,424
Does 1187 Hundertwasser
ring a bell?

1049
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,728
(microwave beeps)

1050
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,564
(chilling music)

1051
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,802
(gunshot roars)

1052
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,842
(gunshots crack)

1053
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,413
(tense music)

1054
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,469
(car engine cranks)

1055
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,940
(tires squeal)

1056
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,348
(suspenseful music)

1057
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,723
(tires screech)

1058
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,463
(wrench rattles)

1059
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,508
(Annie grunts)

1060
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,312
(pipe squeaks)

1061
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,618
(elevator rumbles)

1062
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,657
(Annie gasps)

1063
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,661
(tense music)

1064
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,277
- Did you kill him?

1065
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,747
(Annie gasps)

1066
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,954
(Annie shrieks)

1067
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,356
(Annie growling)

1068
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,392
Did you kill him?

1069
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:37,559
Did you kill him?

1070
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,460
- Yes!

1071
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,332
(Annie sobs)

1072
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,705
(ominous music)

1073
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:07,022
(faucet running)

1074
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,337
(helicopter buzzing)

1075
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,910
(haunting music)

1076
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,687
Do you still want
to go away with me?

1077
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,727
Do you want to stay here?

1078
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,537
I could help you.

1079
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:13,088
(shotgun cocks)

1080
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,604
(shrimp boiling)

1081
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,622
(soft jazz music)

1082
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,060
I could make it painless.

1083
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,434
(glass crashes)

1084
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,903
(tense music)

1085
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,240
(Tommy grunts)

1086
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,578
(Tommy screaming)

1087
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,487
- Oh my god!
