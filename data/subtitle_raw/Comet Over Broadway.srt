1
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:45,375
Hi Pete.
- Hello Ben.

2
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:47,876
Well, you're right on time.
- You bet.

3
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:50,943
That's the boy.

4
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,183
Eve, here is your Times and Tribune.
- Thanks, Ben. Put them there.

5
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:04,633
Here is them theater
magazines you ordered.

6
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:06,780
Oh swell. I've been waiting for those.

7
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:09,026
I don't know why.
You ain't never sold any.

8
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,342
I know. <i>I </i>read them.

9
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:13,653
I can't make head nor
tail of that magazine.

10
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:15,443
Why don't they put it in English?

11
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:18,233
We in the theatre have a language
all our own. We understand.

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,280
It's just what your mother used to say.
- Yeah?

13
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:22,734
Yep. You know, Eve ..

14
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:26,346
She used to come in here
after that .. carnival troop ..

15
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,449
She'd read that paper
from cover to cover.

16
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:31,683
Then she'd talk about how she's
going to be on Broadway next year.

17
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:33,794
With her name in big electric lights.

18
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:35,968
But somehow ..
- Yeah. I know.

19
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,979
Somehow she never made the grade.

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,591
Well, you can't blame her for trying.

21
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:42,006
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,544
Hi Willis.
- Hello, Eve.

23
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:53,586
Hey, Mr Harvey.

24
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,400
What's all the excitement about?
Somebody important passing through?

25
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,439
Yes, Eve. John Banks the
actor from New York.

26
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,292
He's taken a cottage at Sulphur Springs.

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,838
Banks?

28
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,327
He couldn't be coming to Burnsdale?

29
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:10,973
We'll soon find out.

30
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:15,550
Mr Banks?
- Yes.

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,611
Right this way.

32
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,876
Will you hold it please.

33
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,292
Thank you.
- Oh, Mr Banks.

34
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:24,650
I'm Harvey, editor
of the Burnsdale Star.

35
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:26,848
We're mighty pleased
about this visit of yours.

36
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,008
And hope you enjoy every minute ..
- Thank you.

37
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,721
Greetings and salutations to you all.

38
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:31,885
Oh, Mr Banks.

39
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,591
We're just giving a little play
tomorrow night over at the hotel.

40
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,905
We would certainly like to
have you come to see it.

41
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,940
Mr Adams, your autograph please.

42
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,497
How long you figuring on
staying with us, Mr Banks?

43
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:59,327
That, dear chap is entirely
in the hands of ..

44
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,672
Oh, Mr Banks. This is Eve Appleton.

45
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:02,982
She's our leading lady.

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,577
How do you do, sir.

47
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:07,067
All ready to go, sir.
- Come on, driver.

48
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,682
Hello .. Bill.

49
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:21,903
Hello, Evie.

50
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:23,699
Bill, did you see him?
- See who? What?

51
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,784
That was John Banks
that just got off the train.

52
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,331
John Banks, the actor.

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,654
Good heavens, Bill.
Everybody knows him. He's famous.

54
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,789
That's fine, Evie.

55
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,108
Walter.
- Yeah?

56
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,125
Finish this tire for me, will you?
Sixty cents.

57
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,650
The driver is at the Busy Bee diner.
- Okay, Bill.

58
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,424
That fellow Banks sure gave you
the once-over, Miss Appleton.

59
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,246
I thought he knew
you there for a minute.

60
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,251
Better close up the news stand,
Evie. It's almost suppertime.

61
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,983
Lem will take care of that. Come on.

62
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,184
Say .. do you think he'll come
to the play tomorrow night?

63
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:52,176
I don't know.

64
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,791
Look Evie. Don't say
much about it before Ma.

65
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,902
You know how she feels about
play acting, anyway.

66
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,728
What did I say?
- Nothing, darling.

67
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,656
Only I don't want an argument like
we had the last time. That's all.

68
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:04,730
Now, let me see.

69
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:07,477
I think with a new paint job
and with new tires all round ..

70
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,162
We could let you have that
blue roadster for $250.

71
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,266
How is that, Miss Appleton? Okay?

72
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,160
Okay.

73
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,417
There you are, sweet.

74
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:17,610
Thanks, Bill.

75
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,370
How's my big girl?

76
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:22,371
Come on. Put your bib on.

77
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:25,283
My, the kitchen's hot.

78
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:27,862
I almost fainted this morning.

79
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,734
I'll put a fan in there for you,
mum. I meant to do it before.

80
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:33,561
I asked you a dozen times to let me
get a colored girl Mother Appleton.

81
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,050
I'll pay for her wages myself.

82
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:36,926
We don't need any colored girl.

83
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,137
This is your house, Eve.
And your family.

84
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,671
Please. Let's not go into that again.

85
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,972
Sitting down in that depot
all day reading magazines ..

86
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:46,902
And running out to play-act every night.

87
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,971
I should think you'd be old enough to
throw those ideas out of your head.

88
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,525
Hey, mum. Eve said they had a lot of
excitement at the depot this morning.

89
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:56,846
Who was it you said came in, honey?
- John Banks.

90
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,116
He's that famous actor from New York.
- Actor?

91
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,282
He's staying at Sulphur Springs.

92
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,310
Willis asked him to see
our play tomorrow night.

93
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,108
Yeah?

94
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,845
If he comes, I can't forget my lines.

95
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,833
Eve, you're forgetting
to feed your daughter.

96
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,373
There you are, sweetheart.

97
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,545
Oh, I'm warm. Open a window.

98
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:19,707
They are all open, sir.
- Well, close them.

99
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,588
The room is full of bugs.
- Bugs, sir?

100
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:22,653
Yes, bugs.

101
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,493
I quite agree, sir.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,708
[ Clapping noises ]

103
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:39,854
What's that?

104
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,772
Who is applauding who?

105
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,393
A play, sir. Don't you remember?
They asked us to come.

106
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,567
There was a young lady
at the station, sir.

107
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,672
Yes, a lady. Emerson, quick.
Get my coat.

108
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,880
Yes, yes. I remember. Right you are.

109
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,746
The lady.
- Here it is, sir.

110
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,727
It sounds to me as if the
performance is just about over, sir.

111
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:57,623
Really?

112
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,121
That's perfect, Emerson.

113
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,241
Perfect.

114
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:02,100
Good timing for my actions.

115
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,717
You were simply magnificent.
You should be on Broadway, Eve.

116
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,498
Thanks, Willis. Say, did John
Banks see our show tonight?

117
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,619
I don't think so.
No-one saw him come in.

118
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,557
Oh, mother, how thrilling.

119
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,051
John Banks the famous actor
is on his way backstage.

120
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,112
He must have seen the
performance tonight.

121
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,013
Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

122
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,272
Is that him over there now?

123
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,975
My dear, dear girl.

124
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,434
I tell you I've never seen
anything like it in my life.

125
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,025
You were superb. But simply superb.

126
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:53,716
I was swept away. Completely swept away.
And by the other performers.

127
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,754
And you think it really
measured up to standard?

128
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,842
Oh certainly.
But you .. you my dear girl.

129
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,000
You .. are ..

130
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,117
Oh, many a flower is
born to blush unseen ..

131
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,820
And waste its sweetness
on the desert air.

132
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,436
That's awfully kind of you, Mr Banks.

133
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,802
I .. we thought that you hadn't come.

134
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,110
I hadn't come? Why, of course I came.

135
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,474
I sat at the back. I always do.
It frames the illusion more.

136
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,256
I learnt that from Belasco.
- David?

137
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:22,397
Yes of course, David.
Excellent show. Excellent.

138
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:26,000
I saw Viola Allen in the
part years ago in New York.

139
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,198
There isn't .. that .. to
choose between you.

140
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,662
Really?
- Absolutely.

141
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,673
To hear him talk, you'd think there
was nobody else in the show.

142
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:33,849
Wouldn't you.

143
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,349
In the theater you know ..

144
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,377
Success is largely a matter of luck,
influence and the right connections.

145
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,623
I can do a great deal
for you if you let me.

146
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:42,018
I've an awful lot to learn.

147
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:44,967
Oh, it wouldn't take long, you know.
A word here, a word there on Broadway.

148
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:46,259
That's all you need.

149
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:48,069
Really?
- Certainly. Won't you sit down?

150
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,980
Thank you. Oh, Bill.

151
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,618
Bill, won't you come here.

152
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,011
Excuse me a minute, please.

153
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,986
Bill, I want you to meet Mr Banks.
This is my husband, Mr Appleton.

154
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,155
How do you do.
Glad to know you, Mr Banks.

155
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,255
Congratulations.

156
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,699
Your wife is a splendid artist.

157
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:04,961
Who, Eve?

158
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,654
Well, Mr Banks is going to let
me meet his manager tonight.

159
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:09,897
You don't mind waiting a few
minutes more do you, Bill.

160
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,205
No, but it's kinda late, Eve.
I think we'd better go home.

161
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,146
Yes, it is a bit late tonight,
but tomorrow say?

162
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:17,774
Anytime. I'd be most happy
to do whatever I can.

163
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,128
I offered to improve
your wife's technique.

164
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,595
Well .. well, goodnight, Mr Banks.

165
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:25,374
Thanks a lot for everything.
- Au revoir. The pleasure was mine.

166
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:26,612
Goodnight.

167
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,202
What did he mean,
'improve your technique'?

168
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,299
Going out somewhere?

169
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,370
Oh yes.

170
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,919
Yes, I told Sue Miller that
I'd meet her at the movies.

171
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,644
Don't wait up for me.
- Alright.

172
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:12,530
I'll be back in time
for the baby's bottle.

173
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,055
Got your key?
- Uhuh.

174
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,710
Where did she say she was going?
- To a picture show.

175
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,974
Hmm.

176
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:27,050
Pretty much dressed
up for that, wasn't she?

177
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,242
Oh, I didn't notice.

178
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,812
There are lots of things
you don't notice, my son.

179
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:32,968
What? What are you talking about, mum?

180
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:34,922
I get things, even if you don't.

181
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,292
Everyone in town is talking about what
a fool she made of herself last night ..

182
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,913
With that play actor from New York.

183
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,342
That big windbag?

184
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,054
Eve didn't talk to him for five minutes.

185
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,080
How do you know that she didn't
go out to see him just now?

186
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,441
What?

187
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:50,966
She didn't dress up like that
to go anywhere with Sue Miller.

188
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,103
I know that much.
- Look here, mum.

189
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:55,123
I'll not let you talk
that way about Eve.

190
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,145
If she said she went to
a picture show, she did.

191
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:01,337
Well.

192
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,708
It's very easy to find out, my son.

193
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,323
Hello, Bill.

194
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,864
Hello, Helen.

195
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:38,922
Just one?

196
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,014
I don't know. I'm looking for Eve.

197
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:43,748
How long has she been inside?
- Eve hasn't been here tonight, Bill.

198
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:45,828
She hasn't?

199
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,449
Why no. Did she say she was coming?

200
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:51,049
No, I'm just looking.

201
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,241
Of course, I'm delighted you came.

202
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,643
In fact, I'm very flattered
you remembered.

203
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,314
I couldn't forget you.

204
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:03,421
Thank you.

205
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,217
Nice here, isn't it.

206
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,308
A poor place.
An unworthy thing but .. I know.

207
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:11,919
Well.

208
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,082
You told me that you were leaving soon
and I wanted to meet your manager.

209
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:16,878
My manager?
- Yes.

210
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:18,860
Oh, of course.

211
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:21,829
Won't you sit down?

212
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:22,880
Thank you.

213
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,415
And I thought you came to see me.

214
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,799
Oh, I didn't mean that.
- No, of course not.

215
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,871
But you are quite right. Business
before pleasure even in the theater.

216
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,088
Won't you indulge in a little ..?
- No thank you.

217
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:38,178
You know, you don't
look very comfortable.

218
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,855
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.

219
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,314
Would you like to take off your hat?

220
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:45,644
Katharine Cornell never wears a hat.

221
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:47,150
After dark.

222
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:50,784
I say, Emerson.

223
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,644
Come out here a minute, will you.

224
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:55,468
We've just had a most lovely caller.

225
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:57,654
I want you to meet Mrs ..

226
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,009
Appleton.

227
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,597
This is Mr Emerson, my manager.

228
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,144
Mrs Appleton. It's a great pleasure.

229
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,409
Pleased to meet you, Mr Emerson.

230
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,448
Have a really good look
at her, my dear chap.

231
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,375
Isn't she everything I said she was?

232
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,869
Hasn't she definite possibilities?

233
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,425
Oh, decidedly.

234
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:19,539
Decidedly. But definite possibilities.

235
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,493
Do you really think so?

236
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:24,895
My dear young lady, if you can
act, New York is at your feet.

237
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:26,960
Max should see her.

238
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,326
He must see her.

239
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,663
I'll tell you what. Go to the hotel
and send a telegram to Max.

240
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,540
Tell him to take the first train
to Burnsdale. Simply say ..

241
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,931
'We have found another
Catherine Cornell. Stop'.

242
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,711
But I don't know enough yet.

243
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,313
Never mind, just leave that to me.

244
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,115
Hurry, hurry. Before the office closes.

245
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,827
Righto. Excuse me.

246
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,515
Which cottage has John Banks got?

247
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:00,899
John Banks?
- Yes. Banks.

248
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,584
Cottage five, down by the lake.

249
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:06,867
Maybe I'd better announce you. I think
he's got company. You know how it is.

250
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,984
Posture, my dear. Posture.

251
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,990
It's the foundation of a good actress.

252
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,614
Now.

253
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,094
Stomach in.

254
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,618
Chin up.

255
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:25,757
Splendid.

256
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,700
You know you have a perfect face.
Wide, liquid eyes.

257
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,056
Maturity.

258
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,878
You have everything .. but experience.

259
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,051
Eve, walk to the car.

260
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,625
This little scene seems
vaguely familiar.

261
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,545
Even for an amateur performance.

262
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:46,884
Walk to the car, Eve.

263
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:48,361
Yes, Bill.

264
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,487
I resent this intrusion.
- You shut up or I'll ..

265
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:01,238
Listen you clod. I don't care what you
tell your wife but you apologise to me.

266
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:09,819
Miss Sherman.

267
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,787
Do you recognise the
defendant, Bill Appleton?

268
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,441
Yes, I do.

269
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:16,127
Now then, Miss Sherman.

270
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,653
Will you kindly tell the
jury in your own words.

271
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:21,824
Exactly what transpired that night
when the defendant, Bill Appleton ..

272
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:25,496
Came to your theater and enquired from
you as to the whereabouts of his wife.

273
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,466
Well, it was around eight thirty.

274
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,874
And when he came up to me at the theater
and asked if his wife was inside ..

275
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,070
I told him, no. And he looked surprised.

276
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:36,046
Then he rushed off,
sort of mad and excited.

277
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:37,814
Well ..

278
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,581
He came in the hotel kind of wild-like.

279
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,325
And he asked me where John
Banks' cottage was and I told him.

280
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,270
And then he ran off in that direction.

281
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,376
His eyes blazing.

282
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,212
There was no sign of death by drowning
as no water found in the lungs.

283
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,021
In my opinion, John Banks died
of a concussion of the brain.

284
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,278
Caused by a sudden and
severe blow on the left temple.

285
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,194
You don't deny that you were
alone with the deceased?

286
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,388
In his apartment that night
when your husband came in?

287
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,762
We were alone, but he was talking ..
- Never mind. Just answer my question.

288
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:09,425
Your husband was jealous and angry
when he came in. Wasn't he?

289
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:11,132
He was upset.

290
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,102
He was angry and threatening, wasn't he?

291
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,008
Well, yes.

292
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:16,707
No .. no!

293
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,693
And lastly, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

294
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,759
A motive of jealousy has been
established by the prosecution ..

295
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,505
On the un-contradicted
testimony of three witnesses.

296
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,257
Whether that jealousy was justified
or not is no concern of yours.

297
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:31,409
What you are called upon to decide ..

298
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,876
Is whether the defendant,
William Appleton ..

299
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,634
Believed in wife's guilt sufficiently to
cause him to premeditate murder.

300
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:40,334
Should you decide that
question in the affirmative.

301
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:41,858
Then your verdict must read:

302
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,035
Guilty of murder in the first degree.

303
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,425
That is all.

304
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:46,732
Your Honor.
- Yes?

305
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,524
Your Honor will grant me an exception
to the last portion of your charge?

306
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:50,966
Exception noted.

307
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,858
The jury will retire.

308
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,237
Do they always take this long?

309
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:21,937
In homicide cases, yes.

310
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:24,182
Now come on, Eve. Sit down.

311
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,116
You're getting yourself all worked up.

312
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:28,113
They're liable to be out
there for hours yet.

313
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,552
If I only knew what
they were going to do.

314
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:31,844
I know.

315
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:33,641
You know what?

316
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,104
What the jury is going to do.

317
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,866
What do you mean?

318
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,120
They are going to find Bill guilty
of murder in the first degree.

319
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:44,691
Joe.

320
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,428
I never felt any other way.

321
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,764
I did my best of course.

322
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,393
If you'd have had more money and
a famous Lawyer like Darrell.

323
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:54,887
You might have beaten them.

324
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,097
But the name of John Banks
was too big a name.

325
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,756
All that publicity had us
licked before we started.

326
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,313
How can you say that now?

327
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,735
Because it's true.

328
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,177
Bill Appleton, an innocent man, is going
to pay for the murder of John Banks.

329
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:10,782
And do you want to know who
is really guilty of the crime?

330
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,606
You.

331
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:14,838
I am?

332
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,314
You lied, Eve.

333
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,111
Calmly and deliberately
you lied to Bill.

334
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,070
That lie killed John Banks.

335
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:22,495
Bill loves you.

336
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,653
It's a kind of love I don't
think you understand.

337
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:29,658
Dumb, patient, trusting. Like a dog.

338
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,132
Of course no-one can blame you
about having dreams of things ..

339
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:35,977
Away from this drab town.

340
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,868
On the stage or Broadway or
whatever is on your mind.

341
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,271
We all have our dreams tucked away.

342
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:43,988
But when you wed Bill ..

343
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:47,344
You should have put that dream far
away in a private corner of your heart.

344
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,638
You didn't do it.

345
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,558
Instead, as time went on ..

346
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:55,416
You allowed that dream to become more
important than your husband or baby.

347
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,052
No Eve, you didn't give
Bill an even break.

348
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,831
If you had, this would
never have happened.

349
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,054
Alright Joe, the jury is coming in.
- Thanks, Pete.

350
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:08,543
Come on, Eve.

351
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,178
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you agreed upon a verdict?

352
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:49,198
We have.

353
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,398
Do you find the defendant William
Appleton guilty or not guilty?

354
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,003
Guilty of murder in the first degree.

355
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,040
William Appleton.

356
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,652
The court, considering your reputation
for industry and honest living ..

357
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,608
Will not impose the death penalty.

358
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:10,971
But does sentence you to imprisonment
for the rest of your natural life.

359
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,037
Alright Ed. Open up.

360
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,097
Bill.

361
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:51,358
Just a minute, please.

362
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:52,549
Okay.

363
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:54,772
Don't worry about me,
Evie. I'll be alright.

364
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,946
It's you I'm worried about.

365
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:58,640
You and the baby.

366
00:19:59,171 --> 00:19:59,986
Look, Bill.

367
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,141
I want to kiss you goodbye.

368
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,801
Then I'll tell you something,
and then I'm going away.

369
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,623
And you aren't to say
a word. Understand?

370
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,944
Sure, Evie. Anything you say.

371
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:15,229
Now listen, Bill.

372
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,162
And listen carefully.

373
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,269
I haven't been the best wife in the
world. No. Please Bill, you promised.

374
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,166
I haven't done a lot of
things I should have.

375
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:26,224
I didn't see that before, but I do now.

376
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,845
Today, after I leave here.

377
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,901
Jackie and I are going
away from Burnsdale.

378
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,596
I'll write you every week.

379
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,275
And I'll always be in touch with Joe.

380
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,482
But I might not see you again until ..

381
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,762
Until after my job is done.

382
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:42,132
And my job is to get you out of here.

383
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:46,098
From now on, everything
I do is part of that job.

384
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,263
And .. when my work is done.

385
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,508
And you are freed.

386
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,126
Then I swear that I'll
come back as your wife.

387
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,481
And I'll try to make
you as happy as I can.

388
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,198
Goodbye, Bill.

389
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,834
Goodbye, boy. I'll be seeing you.

390
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,160
Come on, Appleton.

391
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,435
Don't know where you'll put her.

392
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:29,433
Well, I got to find some place.
Porter. Make up Number 6, will you.

393
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:30,522
Yes, sir.

394
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,876
You kids get to bed. You got
an early call in the morning.

395
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,723
Say, what is this anyway?

396
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,559
Grand Central waiting room?

397
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:38,854
I'm sorry, Tim.

398
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:41,983
There is a new girl joining the show at
Wichita and we're pulling in there now.

399
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,868
I got to get her some place to sleep.

400
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,871
Well, why can't she join in the daytime?

401
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,550
Three shows a day.

402
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,899
A sleeper jump each night but no sleep.

403
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,606
What do you think I am,
an outboard motor?

404
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,178
Alright, alright.

405
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,046
You got a couple of hours.
You might as well knock 'em off.

406
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,543
Oh, what's the use.

407
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,403
You got a cigarette?

408
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:02,799
Here. A couple of drags for you.

409
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:03,822
Thanks.

410
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,928
What's this new girl like?
Do I know her?

411
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,528
'Wilson' is the name. Her agent
shipped her on. I guess she's alright.

412
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:13,848
Say, is that her?

413
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,529
Yes.

414
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,486
And a baby.
That's all this troupe needed.

415
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:22,370
Carriage 4, Miss.
- This way, Miss Wilson.

416
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:23,814
Are you Mr Haines?

417
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,280
Yes, I'm the manager. Here's your bunk.
Let me take your bag.

418
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,579
You can park the kid there
while he's fixing the berth.

419
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,223
Hey, porter. Will you make it up.

420
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,368
This is Miss Adams, our
prima-donna, Miss Wilson.

421
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,111
Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do.

422
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,389
See you in the morning.

423
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,149
Porter, make it snappy.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,146
Your kid?
- Sure.

425
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,199
Kinda sleepy, isn't she?
- Ah, no.

426
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:44,976
She gets a little upset sometimes.
When she wakes up sudden like.

427
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:46,442
Yeah, who wouldn't.

428
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,436
A fine life for a baby.
- She doesn't seem to mind.

429
00:22:50,396 --> 00:22:53,080
Putting on weight all the time.
- Bet that's more than you're doing.

430
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,074
Been in burlesque long?
- This is my first show.

431
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:58,202
Where are you from?

432
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:00,496
I was in a carnival four months.
- A carnival?

433
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:02,551
Ha. Twenty shows a day?

434
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,728
Say, after that you ought
to like burlesque.

435
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,529
It will be better for her, too.

436
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,219
All ready ma'am.
- Thank you.

437
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,221
There is my good little girl.

438
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:13,451
Yes.

439
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:16,367
Almost in bed, darling.

440
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:20,284
Can I help you, Miss?
- I guess I can make it.

441
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:22,427
No, no. You take the lower.
I'll sleep up there.

442
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:24,891
I don't want to put you out.
- I'm used to it.

443
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:28,062
I'm getting close to forty and
I've been a sucker all my life.

444
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:30,297
Go on, get the kid in there
and get her to sleep.

445
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,359
She is kinda tired.
You can't blame her much.

446
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:33,726
Come on, sweetheart.

447
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:44,812
I tell you some women aren't
even fit to be mothers.

448
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,693
Jamie, hang a new set of
lines on here in the morning.

449
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,204
Why don't you go home?

450
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:59,233
He hasn't got any home.

451
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:02,187
Say, don't you get enough of
that with four shows a day?

452
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:03,955
Can I help it if I'm conscientious?

453
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,719
Who are you waiting for?
- Eve Wilson.

454
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,642
Why?
- Why not leave her alone?

455
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,799
What do you mean?
We're breaking in an act together.

456
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,895
Yeah, I saw you rehearsing that stale
routine. That won't get you anywhere.

457
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:16,752
No? What would you say if I told
you we already got bookings?

458
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,125
I'd say you were a liar.

459
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:21,579
Yeah, well look. There's a telegram
from my agent. Take a gander at that.

460
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,296
What did you do? Send it to yourself?

461
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,930
Ha. Vaudeville.

462
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,359
Work one week and lay off three.
If you're lucky.

463
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,308
The girl is doing alright where she is.

464
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,004
She's happy and the kid is happy.

465
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,989
So, a cheap honky-tonk piano player like
you comes and puts ideas in her head.

466
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,719
Why don't you mind your own business?

467
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,402
Why don't you mind yours?
- Ah, you give me a pain in the neck.

468
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,792
Eve. Evie.
- What is it, Tommy?

469
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,807
It's here. A cinch.
- You hear from the agent?

470
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,016
Look. We open in Duluth in two weeks.

471
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,449
Gee, Tommy. That's swell.

472
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:53,448
If we make good in Duluth, we're a cinch
for 40 weeks of darned good vaudeville.

473
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:55,419
That means more money, too?
- And how.

474
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:57,609
Of course, Duluth is not
Broadway, but don't worry.

475
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,669
Brogan and Wilson will get there too.
- You bet we will.

476
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:03,223
It's kind of cold this time
of year up in Duluth.

477
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:06,541
I must get some warm things for Jackie.
- Oh, Jackie. Oh yes.

478
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,469
That's one thing I wanted
to talk to you about too.

479
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:12,013
Now, look. Understand, I like kids.
I'm crazy about them.

480
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,940
But when you hop around the
country making one-night stands.

481
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,376
Getting in and out of Pullmans.
If you've got kids, no dice.

482
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:18,820
I don't get you, Tommy.

483
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,758
You got an aunt or uncle someplace where
we can park the kid until we get going?

484
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,968
Oh, Jackie wouldn't be in the way.
She's such a little, small baby.

485
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,168
Big or small, on the road
a kid is a nuisance.

486
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,800
They're always catching whooping
cough or measles or something.

487
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,721
Why, the first thing you know they'll
be a packed house out there, waiting.

488
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,309
While we're in quarantine.

489
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,544
When Jackie has measles
I want to have them too.

490
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,196
So will you when you get to know her.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

491
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,192
You park the kid someplace and
I'll make it 'Wilson and Brogan'.

492
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,841
And where would you suggest I park her?

493
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:46,993
Well, if you folks can't
see this your way ..

494
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,263
There is always those children's homes.

495
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,614
Now look, don't take it that way.

496
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,878
Some pretty big people have
come out of those homes.

497
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:56,077
Yeah, but big people
didn't put them in there.

498
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:58,659
I guess you'd better do a single, Tommy.

499
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:01,740
I can't. I need you, Eve.
I can't get along without you.

500
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:03,670
And neither can Jackie.

501
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,434
But Eve.
- Count me out.

502
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:07,410
Goodnight, Tommy.

503
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:42,222
There's a good girl.

504
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,662
Yes, darling. It isn't so bad, is it.

505
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:46,611
No, you're going to be alright.

506
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,278
You're going to wake
everybody up, darling.

507
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,412
Say, what is this anyway?
Feeding time at the zoo?

508
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:54,216
Why can't you keep that child quiet?
- She doesn't do it all the time.

509
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:56,386
No, she sort of does
it ever night, that's all.

510
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:59,049
And she keeps everybody awake.
What's the matter with her, anyhow?

511
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:01,988
What's wrong with her?
Oh I know, she wants her doggy.

512
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,205
Where is it? Get out the way, you don't
know about taking care of children.

513
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:08,455
Come on darling, look. It's your old
auntie Tim that's with you now.

514
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,595
Here it is. Here's your doggy.

515
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:13,564
Rin-Tin-Tin. The winner
of all the bright medals.

516
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:15,584
Now you're going to sleep, aren't you.

517
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,334
Just peaceful and quiet.

518
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:18,832
Sure you are.

519
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,744
Sure you are.

520
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:28,295
She kinda likes you, doesn't she.

521
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,231
Don't give me that.
I know what you're up to.

522
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:31,784
What are you talking about?

523
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:34,273
I hear you're going into vaudeville.
- So what?

524
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:37,036
I've seen ambitious
dames like you before.

525
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:39,875
You know, you can't get far in show
business with a kid on your hands.

526
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,092
What's it to you?

527
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:44,135
Ah, don't be cute. You know you're
just dying to palm her off on to me.

528
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:46,303
So that's what you think.

529
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,441
Sure.

530
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:50,114
You've got me all figured out.

531
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:52,973
I'm getting close to forty.
I'm thinking of quitting this racket.

532
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,404
I've saved money all along.

533
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,855
I'd make a pretty good touch as
a second-hand mama, wouldn't I?

534
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:59,847
If you've finished patting yourself
on the back you can do me a favor.

535
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:00,936
Yeah?
- Yeah.

536
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,157
Get out and stay out.

537
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:05,435
What's the matter?

538
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,536
Annoyed because I told you the truth?
- It wasn't the truth.

539
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,062
Sure, I've got ambitions,
but Jackie goes with them.

540
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:13,398
And I don't think of giving
her up to you or anyone else.

541
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,363
Ah, why don't you stop
telling yourself jokes.

542
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,292
I know more about you
than you think I do.

543
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:18,855
In what way?
- The hard way.

544
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:19,605
Ha.

545
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,983
Just because I'm getting near forty does
not mean my eyes and ears aren't good.

546
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:25,061
You're young. You're in burlesque.

547
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:26,921
You never talk about your past.

548
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:30,261
The kid's father is just a bad memory
to you. Probably the town's Casanova.

549
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,577
You're paying him off and
are tickled to death to do it.

550
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,887
Well. So you've been reading my mail.

551
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:38,012
As long as you know that much,
you might as well know all of it.

552
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:39,737
Jackie's father is in jail for life.

553
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:42,344
And everything I do and every
move I make is to help him.

554
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:46,782
Gee kid, I guess I got you
all wrong. I didn't think ..

555
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:49,179
You know about the letters I
get from my lawyer, don't you.

556
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,062
Here's one that came tonight. Read it.

557
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:52,766
Eve, I can't ..
- Go ahead. Read it.

558
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,377
And that's about all I'll hear
from you tonight, wise lady.

559
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,456
If you just leave me alone
now, I'd appreciate it.

560
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,016
Alright.

561
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,293
Gee .. I'm sorry I ..

562
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,542
Go on. Leave me alone.

563
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,205
Okay, okay.

564
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:14,082
But remember, I'm still
not taking the kid.

565
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,640
I didn't come to apologise. I just came
back to return your file. I thought ..

566
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,200
Are you sleeping, darling?

567
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,175
The idea of leaving you
in a draught like this.

568
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:02,400
The nerve of her.
Not for one million bucks.

569
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:12,953
How do you like that.
The oriental number is the finale.

570
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,526
Yeah. Say, I just happened to think.

571
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,905
Don't they have any men in a real harem?
- Yeah. In a way.

572
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:23,317
Say look. You're passing a big chance.
You don't get one like this every day.

573
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:25,007
No use, Tommy. It wouldn't work out.

574
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,518
Oh, sure it would. You're making
something big out of nothing.

575
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,265
In no time, we'll be out there
and knocking them dead.

576
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:32,885
You got to think it over.
- I've got to think of Jackie.

577
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:34,319
And I can't do it.

578
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:36,982
Come on, Mary. On stage there. Hurry up.
- Okay.

579
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,237
Well, ain't women something.

580
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:43,184
Hey, Brogan. Wait a minute.
- What do you want?

581
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,987
That was a fine act you and Eve Wilson
put on for my benefit just now.

582
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,755
Tell her from me she's wasting her time.

583
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,677
What the matter? Nutty or something?
- She just turned down vaudeville, eh?

584
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:52,433
Yeah.
- She won't leave her kid.

585
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:53,225
Yeah.

586
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:55,590
And she got you to talk about
it in front of me, didn't she?

587
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,403
Didn't she?
- Yeah .. no.

588
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,251
What is it? Tell me, what is
it you're trying to drive at?

589
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:02,617
Just this.

590
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,209
You know I'm quitting the show tomorrow
night. And I'm going home to Boston.

591
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,329
And you both got it figured out that it
will be swell to palm the kid off on me.

592
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,492
So you two could do a
double in vaudeville, see.

593
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:12,887
But it ain't going to work.

594
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,853
Just because I'm getting close to forty
doesn't mean I'm that soft brained.

595
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:18,965
You ain't got much idea of it.

596
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:35,947
Ah, what's the use.

597
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,244
Listen sister, let me
tell you something.

598
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,985
If I <i>should</i> decide to take Jackie
home with me and take care of her.

599
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,687
I could make a swell job of it.

600
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:46,118
And you could go into
vaudeville with the Brogan boy.

601
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,202
What kind of a woman do you think I am?

602
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:50,267
Deep down, fairly sensible.

603
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,784
And smart enough to know
that many a good mother ..

604
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:55,550
Has left has left her child in somebody
else's care when it was necessary.

605
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:59,301
Ah, there is no use
fooling myself any longer.

606
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:01,606
I'm daffy about the kid.

607
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,655
I've been nuts about her
from the first time I saw her.

608
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,664
Go on, laugh.

609
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,206
Hey, Tim.

610
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,466
No encores on the dance
tonight so watch your cue.

611
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:14,814
Okay, okay.

612
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:16,876
I've got plenty of money, I tell you.

613
00:32:17,253 --> 00:32:19,127
Not that I want to support
Jackie all her life.

614
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,504
Later on, you can take care
of both of us if you want.

615
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:22,782
After you've made good.

616
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:24,341
Wait a minute, Tim.

617
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:27,342
Will you answer a question honestly?

618
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:29,069
If I can.

619
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,065
What are you doing all this for?

620
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,367
A tough question, a tough answer.

621
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,802
I had a kid once. Years ago.

622
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,220
A pretty little monkey.

623
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:41,777
Just like Jackie.

624
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:44,124
She was fine one morning.

625
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,272
She was dead that night.

626
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,642
Well.

627
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:52,132
Upon my soul, here comes
Mrs Asterbilt herself.

628
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:53,799
In the flesh.

629
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:56,040
How do you do, Madame?

630
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:58,753
I have never seen you look so gorgeous.

631
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:01,363
Oh dear, dear, dear. Mr Binkeltwist.

632
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:05,367
Such flattery coming from you.
Utterly, you overwhelm me.

633
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,566
Up to here, no less.

634
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,510
No. I never bother with politics.

635
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:43,908
Tim.

636
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:45,462
What?

637
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,582
If you really want to do it.

638
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,380
It's okay with me.

639
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:53,804
I had a baby.

640
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,712
I had a baby.

641
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,114
You're leaving the show Sunday night?

642
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:00,150
Yeah.

643
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,370
Do you mind leaving tonight?

644
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:04,712
Tonight?

645
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,672
Yeah.

646
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,571
Right after the show.

647
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,024
Go home.

648
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:13,152
Take Jackie.

649
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:16,922
I won't get there until
after you've gone.

650
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:20,024
You mean, you're not even
going to tell the kid goodbye?

651
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,234
If I did, I'd never let you have her.

652
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:24,706
Eve.

653
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:41,837
I rather like the way they've
designed this banquet hall.

654
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,450
You will make your entrance through
the double-doors in the center.

655
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,241
The light comes from the candles on
the table. Effective, don't you think?

656
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,489
Grand, Bert. Grand.
- Glad you like it.

657
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,206
You know, I can hardly wait
for rehearsals to start.

658
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:55,227
Well, it won't be long now. We've
only got to get that one part set.

659
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:57,704
How many girls were interviewed today?
- A million.

660
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,561
Well, there can't be many more left.

661
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:03,875
How many left, Miss McDermott?

662
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,258
About eight, and one of them
seems to be fairly intelligent.

663
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:07,985
Ha. I can hardly believe it.

664
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,892
Are you too tired to
see another one, dear?

665
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:12,293
Why not. We might as well
hear the bright one.

666
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,371
Send her in, Miss McDermott.
- Right.

667
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:17,015
It's swell of you, Janet. Giving up
time to help me cast a new play.

668
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,066
Not many stars would do it.
- Oh yes they would.

669
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:21,183
If they were as much in love as I am.

670
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,137
This is Miss Wilson, Mr Ballin.

671
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,246
How do you do, Miss Wilson.
Please sit down.

672
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,660
Thank you.
- Miss Eaton.

673
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,925
She'll read with you.

674
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:33,134
Tell me, do I know your work?
- I doubt it. I've not worked Broadway.

675
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,797
Well, go from the second act.

676
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:36,440
Miss Winifred's entrance.

677
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:37,555
Go on, dear.

678
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,658
Jane, I'm surprised at you.

679
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:43,138
Why did you tell me last night
that my husband hadn't been home?

680
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,097
Forgive me, Mrs Widdecombe.
But I can't answer that question.

681
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:50,003
You can't? Why not?
- Because it wouldn't be fair.

682
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,883
Please don't ask me anymore. Please.

683
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:58,655
But I must ask you.
Why you deliberately lied to me.

684
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,750
Yes, I know I did.

685
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,196
But I lied because I wanted
to save your happiness.

686
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:04,794
That's enough, Miss Wilson.

687
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:06,711
You read very well.
- Yes, she does.

688
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:08,181
You're very kind.

689
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:10,080
Tell me, you have no
Broadway experience?

690
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,192
No, I haven't.

691
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:14,194
It just hasn't happened so far.
- Where are you from?

692
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,777
Well, I .. I was with a
carnival show first.

693
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,672
And after that, burlesque.

694
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:23,145
Then I was a year or so
in vaudeville, and now ..

695
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,684
Well I've been around Broadway
for the last few months.

696
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,564
Hoping for bigger and better things.

697
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,448
You haven't picked an
easy game you know.

698
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:30,910
How well, I know.

699
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:32,480
I like the way you talk.

700
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,854
I'm sure Miss Eaton does too.

701
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,564
How would you like to work and work
very hard for at least a year or so?

702
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:39,677
Oh, yes.

703
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,854
Small parts in the beginning.
- I won't mind that.

704
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,295
And not so much money.
You'd have to get by on very little.

705
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,089
If I made good quickly, I could
make more money couldn't I?

706
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:48,080
Perhaps.

707
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,759
All I want is a chance.

708
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:52,896
Well, the chance is yours.
You will work for me.

709
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,926
Come tomorrow and
we'll discuss a contract.

710
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,937
Your part will be the one you just read
I wish you all the luck in the world.

711
00:36:58,518 --> 00:36:59,305
Thank you.

712
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:01,864
You've both been so good .. goodbye.

713
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:06,480
Rehearsals start Wednesday
morning at ten o'clock.

714
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:09,352
I'll be there.

715
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,989
You know Janet, I've got a hunch
that girl has got something.

716
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,542
Yes. I was watching you.

717
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:19,993
I got it.

718
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:25,849
Do you realize this play opens on Monday
and you still don't know the third act?

719
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:29,528
We've gone over it and over, rehearsed
it and rehearsed it, and still nothing.

720
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,349
Now, you really must
put a little heart into it.

721
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:35,335
With the exception of Miss Wilson, you
all read your lines like wooden Indians.

722
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,706
We've been rehearsing
this play for ten days ..

723
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:40,807
And Miss Wilson is the only cast member
who has caught the spirit of the play.

724
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:43,974
And that goes for everybody.
Now come on, let's do the third act.

725
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,083
Keep the first scene. Start
at Winifred's entrance.

726
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,192
And don't forget she must
not slam the door ..

727
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:50,795
Because she knows the person is
not in the other corner of the room.

728
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:52,808
No, I mean it sincerely.

729
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:54,434
You're doing a grand job.

730
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,391
I'm glad I gave you an important part.
- Thanks, Bert.

731
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,200
You've made it a beautiful play.
- You ought to read the next.

732
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:02,558
You've already given me an idea for it.
- I have?

733
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,163
What is it?
- It's a love story.

734
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,267
Well, that's a new idea.

735
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:09,918
Ha. Something different.

736
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,241
Hadn't we better be getting back?
- Yep.

737
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,380
Going to start with the third act?
- Yes.

738
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,220
I want to hear you read the long speech.
- I don't think I know it yet.

739
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,703
As one wooden Indian to another,
I hope you have a good, long contract.

740
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:31,927
No, I think I'll change all this.

741
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,015
I'd rather you didn't say anything.

742
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,142
As long as you sit there looking at
him intently while he reads the letter.

743
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:38,907
Of course you're in love with him, so ..

744
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:40,215
Say, what's the matter?

745
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:43,772
Hello Janet. What's on your mind?

746
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:45,440
I thought I might find you alone.

747
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,693
Well, Miss Wilson and I
were going out to dinner.

748
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,595
I'll wait outside.
- No. Wait a minute.

749
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:52,553
In that case, you might as well
stay and here what I've got to say.

750
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:55,395
I don't want this girl in my company.

751
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,325
But Janet, you agreed.
- I've changed my mind.

752
00:38:58,818 --> 00:38:59,433
Why?

753
00:38:59,863 --> 00:39:01,975
It's a privilege we stars enjoy.

754
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,745
Now look here, Janet.

755
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,675
You'd like to argue about it, Bert?

756
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:07,685
No. Not right now.

757
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:10,962
Tell Gibson to give her two weeks'
salary and go and let her go.

758
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:14,596
The star, Miss Eaton, must approve
her cast. It's in her contract.

759
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,005
You never did this to me before, Janet.
- No. I've never had the occasion.

760
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,276
This is all a joke, isn't it?

761
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:23,646
You're just fooling.

762
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:24,803
Trying me out.

763
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:27,379
Not at all. Your try-out
is over, Miss Wilson.

764
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:29,898
I see.

765
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,467
A good sport, wasn't it.

766
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,141
Swell fun.

767
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:38,480
Tossing a heart into the clouds and
watching it bounce back into the cellar.

768
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:40,027
Say, now listen.

769
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,354
No, you listen.

770
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,320
Why you've done this
to me, I don't know.

771
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:47,775
All I know it that I've always
dreamed of getting a fair chance.

772
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,182
It meant much more to me than ..

773
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,841
Than just ambition and success.

774
00:39:52,715 --> 00:39:54,800
More than either one
of you will ever know.

775
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:58,449
Wait a minute. I'm the star around here.

776
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,750
If there are any scenes to
be played, I'll play them.

777
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,597
I'm not playing a scene, Miss Eaton.

778
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,961
I'm just telling you.

779
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,263
You don't know what it means.

780
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,336
Eve.

781
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:13,685
Eve, please.

782
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:18,021
I don't know what got into Eaton.
- I think I know, Bert.

783
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:19,687
It wasn't your fault.

784
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:22,086
But you'll still work for me.
I want you back here tomorrow.

785
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:24,369
What?
- There'll be other parts.

786
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:27,332
I'll put you on a personal contract.
We'll have a play ready in a month.

787
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:28,890
No, Bert.

788
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,739
But Eve, it's a great chance for you.
It's what you've been living for.

789
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:33,991
You were born for the stage.

790
00:40:34,553 --> 00:40:35,998
This is only a break in the game.

791
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:39,847
You are honest, genuine .. real.

792
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,041
We'll do great things together.

793
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,291
Oh Eve, it's more than that.

794
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,558
I ..

795
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,174
No, Bert.

796
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:48,909
No.
- Eve.

797
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,137
Did you say a pretty goodbye?

798
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,736
That was the rottenest trick
I've ever seen pulled.

799
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:01,276
For a woman in love, Bert?

800
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,037
I've been watching you with that
girl. That's why I threw her out.

801
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,169
And that's why she's going to stay out.

802
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:07,703
Got a match?
- Sure.

803
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,789
You've been watching me? Well,
do you know what I've just seen?

804
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:11,582
What?

805
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,988
I've seen a fine exhibition
of meanness and pettiness.

806
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,675
I see nothing but unhappiness
for both of us if this keeps up.

807
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:18,336
But it's not going to keep up.

808
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,298
Now, you're just a name
on the program to me.

809
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:21,087
Bert.

810
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:24,119
And whether you like it or not
that's the way it's going to stay.

811
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,985
You sure there's been no slip-up?
- Perfectly sure.

812
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:56,901
She hasn't been here or phoned?
- No, sir.

813
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:58,894
You found out where she lives?
- Yes, we have.

814
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,071
What? Where is it?
- She moved this morning.

815
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,200
Moved?
- Yes.

816
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:04,121
But she left no forwarding address.

817
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,042
Alright. Well, keep looking for her.
- Yes, sir.

818
00:42:07,499 --> 00:42:09,030
Let me know when you hear something.

819
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,712
That play ran for over a year in London.

820
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,766
In the next production
she featured alone.

821
00:42:16,886 --> 00:42:18,727
She's surely changed.
I'd not have known her.

822
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:22,282
Four years can change a lot of things.
With the next plays she wasn't so lucky.

823
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:24,151
Now she's up again.
Here is the playbill.

824
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:26,303
She's starring in one of the
biggest hits in London.

825
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:27,475
Isn't that fine.

826
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,496
When do you sail?
- Tuesday.

827
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,854
Looking forward to the trip?
- Oh no.

828
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,717
Six days bouncing around on a boat is no
thrill for a woman who's approaching 40.

829
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:38,709
No. Well, I hope you enjoy it anyway.

830
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:41,329
Mummy .. mummy.

831
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:43,897
Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:46,564
Jackie, this is Mr Grant.
- How do you do, Jackie.

833
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:49,278
I knew you when you were just a baby.
- Anything you want, dear?

834
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,531
Will I need my long
underwear in England?

835
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:53,260
Yes, you will.

836
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:56,376
We are not going to take any chances.
Now hurry, darling. We've a lot to do.

837
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,365
Goodbye, Jackie. And I hope
you have a very nice trip.

838
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:01,745
Thank you, and goodbye now.
- Goodbye, dear.

839
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:05,551
Well, she's certainly like her mother.

840
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:09,620
If you mean she's stage-struck, right.
Like living with a pint-sized Garbo.

841
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,070
Didn't she call you 'mummy'?

842
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:14,605
Well, you see we haven't told her yet.

843
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,300
Oh I see, because I hope
she'll see her father soon.

844
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:19,009
What?

845
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,960
That's the reason I came to Boston as
soon as I heard you were joining Eve.

846
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:24,722
See, there are things I want
you tell her, Miss Adams.

847
00:43:24,957 --> 00:43:26,882
Things I cannot put in a letter.
- Yes?

848
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:30,557
An account of what I've spent to date.
She's to read them and burn the records.

849
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:32,665
And you are to tell her this.

850
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,716
After seven years of work I'm now in
a position to free Bill Appleton.

851
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,755
Free?

852
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,635
It must be done in the next ten months,
while the governor is still in office.

853
00:43:39,808 --> 00:43:41,167
Of course, it will take money.

854
00:43:41,756 --> 00:43:42,514
How much?

855
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,493
Well roughly, about
ten thousand dollars.

856
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:45,815
Ten thousand?
- Yes.

857
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:49,059
You see, while Eve has always sent me
money, she's never sent me very much.

858
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:51,821
Just enough to make the routine
appeals to the parole board ..

859
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,011
And get a few comforts for Bill in jail.
- And?

860
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,713
Well, setting him free is
something else entirely.

861
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:59,981
I've got to employ powerful
attorneys and important men ..

862
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:01,860
That are politically
close to the governor.

863
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,944
They come high.

864
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:05,612
A lot of money and get it fast, huh?
- I'm afraid so.

865
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:09,098
Otherwise, if I miss this chance Bill
and Eve may never be together again.

866
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:10,243
So what?

867
00:44:10,677 --> 00:44:12,208
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

868
00:44:12,506 --> 00:44:14,623
Oh nothing, Mr Grant. Nothing.

869
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:34,774
Eve.

870
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:37,597
Jackie.

871
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:40,834
Tim, darling.
- Eve.

872
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,420
Jackie.

873
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,984
Take it easy, kid. I'll explain later.
Jackie, this is Eve Wilson.

874
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:47,605
How do you do, Miss Wilson.

875
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:49,597
Mummy's told me a lot about you.

876
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:50,595
Mummy?

877
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:54,070
Oh, she has?

878
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,438
Oh yes. I have your picture in my room.

879
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,133
You're in the family, almost.

880
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:01,428
Stop prattling so much
and keep your head up.

881
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:03,512
You look grand, Eve.

882
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:05,508
Customs inspection is
over this way, ma'am.

883
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,030
Come on, darling.

884
00:45:08,527 --> 00:45:09,825
Mummy, wait for me.

885
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,224
Train for Bristol? Platform 6.
- Thank you.

886
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,402
Mummy .. oh, mummy.

887
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:21,528
Yes, dear?

888
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:23,264
Do you mind if I have some gum, please?

889
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:24,795
No, darling. Here.

890
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,308
Thank you, mummy.

891
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:29,244
Six years I've been waiting to see her.

892
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,038
And what do I get?

893
00:45:32,302 --> 00:45:33,739
'How do you, Miss Wilson'?

894
00:45:35,113 --> 00:45:36,644
Why doesn't she know I'm her mother?

895
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,211
Why didn't you ever tell her? Why?

896
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,044
Okay, lady. Here it is.

897
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,778
Jackie grew up just taking it
for granted I was her mother.

898
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:45,050
Go on.

899
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:47,918
Coming over on the boat, I
tried awfully hard to tell her.

900
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,102
Words kept sticking in my
throat until I got a sore spot.

901
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,967
I couldn't do it.

902
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:54,485
She's too close to me, Eve.

903
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,910
I just couldn't.

904
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,633
In all my letters I sent
messages to Jackie.

905
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,868
Didn't she ..?
- I meant to tell her every year.

906
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:03,545
But I couldn't tell her part of the
story and not tell her the rest.

907
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,280
How could I tell her that
her father was in prison?

908
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:07,371
And why.

909
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:09,846
You don't know Jackie like I do, Eve.

910
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,329
She's not ready for that. Not yet.

911
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:14,101
When the time does come.

912
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,397
I thought you should
be the one to tell her.

913
00:46:19,427 --> 00:46:20,736
Yes. I guess I should.

914
00:46:22,597 --> 00:46:23,441
Thanks, Tim.

915
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:25,521
Thanks for everything.

916
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:27,454
Gee, Eve.

917
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:29,343
She is going to be wild about you.

918
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:30,668
Just wait and see.

919
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:32,808
Then everything will be so much easier.

920
00:46:33,218 --> 00:46:34,005
I'll wait.

921
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:38,035
In the meantime we'll share
her as long as we can.

922
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,172
Don't worry about that.

923
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:42,669
I've had some awfully swell years.

924
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,854
Mummy.

925
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:45,298
Mummy.
- Yes, darling?

926
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:47,468
I think I'm going to like Eve.
- I hope so.

927
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:48,762
I know you will, dear.

928
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:50,526
Mummy says we're going to live with you.

929
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:51,385
Are we?

930
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:52,720
Yes, darling.

931
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,478
And you and I are going to be pals.

932
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,328
Will you teach me to be an actress?

933
00:46:56,764 --> 00:46:57,579
An actress?

934
00:46:57,896 --> 00:46:59,206
Well, if you really want to.

935
00:46:59,326 --> 00:47:01,142
That's the only thing
the child dreams about.

936
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:04,675
When I grow up, I'm going
to be a star just like you.

937
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:06,879
Only bigger. Much, much bigger.

938
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,801
Oh, do you think so?

939
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:10,215
I'm sure.

940
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:12,278
Oh.

941
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,319
Say, do you mind if
I sit over here by you?

942
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:23,999
That make up smells awfully good.

943
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:26,710
Tim.

944
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:28,522
Did Joe Grant say anything else?

945
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:31,605
No. After he mentioned ten thousand
dollars we both stopped talking.

946
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:34,617
Have you got it?
- Of course not.

947
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,153
Between the money I've sent to you and
Joe, my income tax, expenses over here.

948
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,304
I've only saved a couple of thousand.

949
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,292
And you've got to keep
up appearances too.

950
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,999
How are you going to raise
the rest of the money?

951
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,191
I'll get it somehow.

952
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,234
I've got to.

953
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:49,691
It's the first time that Joe
has given me any actual hope.

954
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:51,208
Eve.

955
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,835
Are you still in love
with Jackie's father?

956
00:47:55,468 --> 00:47:56,455
In love with him?

957
00:47:57,558 --> 00:47:59,375
He's been in jail for
seven years, hasn't he.

958
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:00,691
For why?

959
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:02,659
Because he was guilty? Uhuh.

960
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:06,316
Because I didn't have money enough
to pay for lawyers to get him off.

961
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:10,040
It isn't a matter of if I love him.

962
00:48:11,052 --> 00:48:12,268
It's a matter of justice.

963
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:15,625
Does that answer your question?

964
00:48:16,256 --> 00:48:17,089
I think so.

965
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,144
Hey, you're early.
They're still applauding.

966
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:34,573
It's him. I saw him.
- Who?

967
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:36,084
In the audience. Staring at me.

968
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,577
Well, who?
- Bert Ballin.

969
00:48:38,153 --> 00:48:40,513
Say, isn't he that New York producer?
- I don't want to see him.

970
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:42,932
Tell him I'm that I've left.
Tell him anything.

971
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,673
Sure. But wait until he gets here.

972
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:46,351
Say.

973
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:49,394
What does this guy mean to you anyway?

974
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,414
I haven't seen him for four years, Tim.

975
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:53,897
If you must know, he's the
reason I left New York.

976
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:55,504
Oh.

977
00:48:57,562 --> 00:48:58,177
And?

978
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:01,285
That's just as hard to explain
as it is to understand.

979
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:04,409
I rehearsed a play for
ten days with Bert Ballin.

980
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,605
It was my first New York job.

981
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,627
Gee, he was wonderful to me.

982
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:11,024
I knew if I saw any more of him ..

983
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:13,059
Or let him anywhere near me, that ..

984
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,488
That I'd forget the one thing
I'd sworn to remember.

985
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,213
Don't let them tell you
it can't happen, Tim.

986
00:49:20,031 --> 00:49:20,976
I know it can.

987
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:22,096
[ Buzzer ]

988
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:23,485
I'm not in.

989
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,049
[ Buzzer ]

990
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:39,238
Will you ask Miss Wilson
if she will see me, please.

991
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:41,616
Yes. She'll see you, Come in.

992
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,961
Make yourself at home.
I'll tell Miss Wilson you're here.

993
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,012
Thanks.

994
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,872
Eve .. Mr Ballin is here to see you.

995
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:10,293
Hello there.

996
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:13,240
Hello again. After all this time.

997
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,869
I saw the show tonight.

998
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:16,451
You are a great artist.

999
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,631
Thank you.

1000
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:19,373
No, no. I mean it sincerely.

1001
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,682
I'm proud to think I
guessed it so long ago.

1002
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:24,111
Praise from you would
make any actress happy.

1003
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,358
You didn't think so then, did you.
- Oh yes I did.

1004
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:27,759
Then why did you run away?

1005
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,751
I owe you an apology for that.

1006
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:31,430
And why didn't you answer my letters?

1007
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:34,252
I never meant to be unkind. Believe me.

1008
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:35,995
I just felt that ..

1009
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:38,080
That I must make my way alone.

1010
00:50:38,544 --> 00:50:40,629
Without you.
- Well, you've done it brilliantly.

1011
00:50:41,156 --> 00:50:43,202
I come to you as a humble
playwright to a great star.

1012
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:44,681
Will you read a play of mine?

1013
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:46,269
Of course.

1014
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:49,092
If you like it, I'll do the play with
you in New York as soon as it's ready.

1015
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:51,746
It's not as easy as all that.
- You know ..

1016
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:54,255
Deep down, I think I wrote
the play for you, Eve.

1017
00:50:55,414 --> 00:50:56,518
Really?
- Yes.

1018
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:59,280
At least, you were seldom out of
my mind when I was working on it.

1019
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:05,384
Bert.

1020
00:51:06,486 --> 00:51:07,788
I want to ask you something.

1021
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:08,665
What?

1022
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:12,711
If I gambled on your play,
would you gamble on me?

1023
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:14,179
How do you mean?

1024
00:51:14,325 --> 00:51:16,831
I'm going to need a large sum
of money, ten thousand dollars.

1025
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,476
If I open in your play,
and it is successful ..

1026
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:22,298
Would you advance me that
much to use against my contract?

1027
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,685
I don't see why not.

1028
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:25,582
Thank you.

1029
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:28,617
When can I have the play?
- I'll send it to you in the morning.

1030
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:29,520
Alright.

1031
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:32,093
I'll read it and let you know
afterwards. Goodnight, Bert.

1032
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:32,893
Eve.

1033
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:34,891
Goodnight. Thanks.

1034
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:24,438
What are you hopping about so for?

1035
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,168
Mummy, does this remind you of tonight?

1036
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:31,715
Oh, I love to be in a London park.

1037
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:33,454
The fog.

1038
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,321
Yes, the fog.

1039
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:37,434
It simply smothers me.

1040
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:39,469
But I love it so.

1041
00:52:40,128 --> 00:52:42,408
You're going to love to go to
bed in about five minutes, too.

1042
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,565
Mummy, I think I'll be a
music hall comedy star.

1043
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:48,106
Tragedy annoys me sometimes.

1044
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:49,235
That's too bad.

1045
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,519
But music.

1046
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:53,477
Ah, music has a lullaby all of its own.

1047
00:52:56,245 --> 00:52:57,556
Some lullaby.

1048
00:52:58,411 --> 00:52:59,283
I don't know.

1049
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:02,341
Tragedy suits my personality better.

1050
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,779
Why doesn't he come?

1051
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,352
Why doesn't he come?
- Get up.

1052
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:08,860
Oh, that's right.

1053
00:53:09,513 --> 00:53:11,557
It is he, my loved one.

1054
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:13,700
He has a gun.

1055
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,541
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1056
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:21,372
Wonderful, darling.
- Bravo. Bravo.

1057
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,364
Did you really like it?
- You bet we did.

1058
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:25,678
There's one thing, Jackie,
if you must be a great actress.

1059
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:27,828
What's that?
- You must learn to keep your head up.

1060
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,099
You too?

1061
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,796
Great, kid.

1062
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:35,582
Really swell. The finest opening
night performance I've ever seen.

1063
00:53:35,842 --> 00:53:37,307
Thanks, Tim. You're sweet.

1064
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:39,006
Congratulations, Bert.

1065
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,000
It was a grand job all the way around.
- Thanks, Tim.

1066
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,549
Why didn't you come backstage?

1067
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,676
I was afraid there would
be too many people.

1068
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:48,424
Jackie and I stopped and got a hot
chocolate and now we're going to bed.

1069
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:49,701
Come on, Jackie.

1070
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:51,984
Eve.

1071
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,068
I think you're swell.

1072
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:55,409
Thanks, darling.

1073
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,237
I'd rather hear you say that
than anyone else in the world.

1074
00:53:58,771 --> 00:53:59,529
Hey, you.

1075
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:00,556
Psst.

1076
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:01,855
Ah, gee.

1077
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,977
Sometimes, I don't think mummy
understands my artistic temper.

1078
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,051
Goodnight, Eve.
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

1079
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:13,014
Goodnight, Mr Ballin.
- Goodnight.

1080
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,961
And that's my cue also.
Goodnight, you two.

1081
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,643
I'm still so excited.

1082
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,617
Do you mind if I walk up and down for
a bit? I just can't seem to sit still.

1083
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,028
Go on, keep travelling.

1084
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:30,056
On the night of my first Broadway hit I
walked from 42nd Street to Bronx Zoo.

1085
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:32,034
I'm liable to cover
the same mileage here.

1086
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:35,156
You know, Mr Ballin.
You look very handsome tonight.

1087
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:38,528
That's just part of the excitement.
I'll look normal again in the morning.

1088
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:40,493
Are you hungry?
- Too nervous to eat.

1089
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,449
How about some wine?
- No, I don't need it.

1090
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:44,972
The way I feel, I could out-bubble
champagne, two to one.

1091
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:47,005
Come here, you.

1092
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,337
I've got to let lose some
of this excess energy.

1093
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:50,767
Say.

1094
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:52,909
I didn't hit you too hard, did I?

1095
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:54,560
Yes, you did.

1096
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,721
It was years ago, too.
And I still feel the punch.

1097
00:54:59,364 --> 00:55:02,631
Bert, that audience tonight.
They weren't fooling us, were they?

1098
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:04,860
No, we're successful alright.
I know the symptoms.

1099
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,650
We're good for a year on Broadway.
Then we can clean up on the road.

1100
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:08,762
Oh, Bert.

1101
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:11,582
Bert, I'm so happy I could weep.

1102
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:13,701
No crying tonight, young lady.

1103
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:17,059
I have something that will change that.
- Do you know why I feel this way?

1104
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,463
Because I know that life will never
hold so much for me again.

1105
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,277
It will be so beautiful.

1106
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,200
Oh.

1107
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,193
Here is the advance you asked for.

1108
00:55:27,555 --> 00:55:28,661
Advance?
- Yes.

1109
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,069
Why, what's the matter?

1110
00:55:34,403 --> 00:55:36,019
You look as though you've seen a ghost.

1111
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:39,272
Yes.

1112
00:55:40,202 --> 00:55:41,029
I have.

1113
00:55:44,017 --> 00:55:46,692
That's a fine thing to say to a fellow
who's going to ask you to marry him.

1114
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:47,694
Bert.

1115
00:55:48,447 --> 00:55:50,660
A very simple wedding.
Just the three old 'R's.

1116
00:55:51,154 --> 00:55:52,468
Ring, rice and the Reverend.

1117
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,254
Bert, there's something I've got
to tell you about this check.

1118
00:55:55,374 --> 00:55:58,144
I ask a girl to marry me and she tries
to tell me the history of a check.

1119
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:00,153
But you mustn't. Not until you've heard.

1120
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,194
I don't doubt you've got a lot to tell
me about your past but .. look at me.

1121
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:06,274
I've robbed banks, poisoned wells,
pulled little children's noses.

1122
00:56:06,452 --> 00:56:07,654
You can't match that.

1123
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,509
There is only one thing
I want to know from you.

1124
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,577
Do you love me?
- Please.

1125
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,827
Do you love me?

1126
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:18,048
The first day we met
you knew I loved you.

1127
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,805
You knew it in London.

1128
00:56:20,428 --> 00:56:21,507
You know it now.

1129
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,108
You know it now.

1130
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:30,098
Do you know how much I love you?
Did you see tonight's program?

1131
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,148
Your name is printed
twice as big as mine.

1132
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,109
Greater love hath no playwright.

1133
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:36,304
Hmm?

1134
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,992
Will you just lie perfectly
still and let me talk?

1135
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,426
Must you?

1136
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:43,613
Alright. Go ahead.

1137
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:47,257
You know that check you gave me?

1138
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,159
That was to get a man out of jail.

1139
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:52,041
He's in for murder.

1140
00:56:52,678 --> 00:56:53,379
Murder?

1141
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,905
Yes .. a life sentence.

1142
00:56:57,732 --> 00:56:59,045
He had a wife and baby too.

1143
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,592
That was eight years ago.

1144
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:03,436
And in time.

1145
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,717
The wife knew that she was
guiltier than he was.

1146
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:08,529
And she made a pledge.

1147
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:10,166
To set him free.

1148
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:13,035
She swore that when he was freed.

1149
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:15,685
She'd go back to him with her child.

1150
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:18,496
Tell me.

1151
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:20,273
This girl.

1152
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,047
Does she still love her husband?

1153
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:25,042
No.

1154
00:57:26,796 --> 00:57:28,844
I don't think she ever
loved him .. this way.

1155
00:57:30,255 --> 00:57:31,986
That makes it all very
simple, doesn't it.

1156
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:33,577
Simple.

1157
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,815
She sets her husband free and
goes back to the man she loves.

1158
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,354
Isn't that the only thing for her to do?

1159
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:42,511
Answer me, Eve.

1160
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:44,155
Isn't it?

1161
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:45,779
No, Bert.

1162
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,687
Do you mean you want to go back to him?

1163
00:57:48,338 --> 00:57:49,582
Of course I don't want to.

1164
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:52,547
But after I've worked out your
advance of ten thousand dollars.

1165
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,661
That's what I have to do.

1166
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,536
But you never loved him. You said that.

1167
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:58,599
Even so.

1168
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:00,187
But why .. why?

1169
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:02,262
This was all years ago.

1170
00:58:02,655 --> 00:58:04,558
Eve, you've changed.
You're not the same person.

1171
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,157
He can't expect you to
keep a promise like that.

1172
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:09,282
Eight years in prison.

1173
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,419
What do you think that does to a man?

1174
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:13,496
Do you think He could come here to this?

1175
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:15,190
He doesn't know about this.

1176
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,566
Suppose he did know?

1177
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,144
He won't find out.

1178
00:58:21,554 --> 00:58:22,713
They'll never find out.

1179
00:58:22,904 --> 00:58:24,520
Eve, you don't know what you're saying.

1180
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:26,739
This whole thing doesn't make sense.

1181
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:28,579
It's not right.

1182
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:30,776
Listen, darling.

1183
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:33,247
I love you for what
you want to do but ..

1184
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:35,917
What do you think you can give
another man as long as you love me?

1185
00:58:36,377 --> 00:58:39,268
Every hour, every minute you lived
with him you'd be lying to him.

1186
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,089
Would he want that?

1187
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,034
Is he selfish enough? Bitter enough?

1188
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:46,003
To crucify you and Jackie for
a promise made so long ago?

1189
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,649
Now man worth that
sacrifice would want it.

1190
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:51,863
Your happiness would
come first, not his.

1191
00:58:52,514 --> 00:58:54,782
But is it right to ..?
- The right thing is the kind thing.

1192
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:58,250
And there is only one kind,
one honest thing for you to do.

1193
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,528
Go to him and tell him the truth.

1194
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:03,307
About yourself and about us.

1195
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:05,438
Then you'll both be free.

1196
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:08,867
Free from lies and heartache and
deception for the rest of your lives.

1197
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:11,850
It's going to be hard, Eve.
Terribly hard.

1198
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:13,589
But it's right.

1199
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:15,465
You see that now?

1200
00:59:15,897 --> 00:59:17,284
You know it's right, don't you.

1201
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,951
Just have a seat, Mrs Appleton.
He'll be right in.

1202
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:28,473
Thank you.

1203
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:43,308
Evie.

1204
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:45,437
Bill.

1205
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:50,576
How are you?

1206
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:52,756
I knew it.

1207
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,503
You're just the same.

1208
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,841
You look just like I knew you would.

1209
00:59:57,797 --> 00:59:59,061
I'm a little older, Bill.

1210
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,216
No, no .. just the same.

1211
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:04,869
You didn't bring Jackie.

1212
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:06,215
Well ..

1213
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,917
Jackie is in school.

1214
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:10,044
She's a big girl now.

1215
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:11,802
Gee, I can hardly wait to see her.

1216
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:14,667
Eve .. tell me quick. Is it true?

1217
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:15,918
What?

1218
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:17,848
What Joe Grant was telling me.

1219
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:19,986
About me being free again.

1220
01:00:20,372 --> 01:00:21,123
Maybe.

1221
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,464
It isn't 'maybe' anymore, Bill.

1222
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,450
We're almost positive now.

1223
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,986
In a few months, you're
going to be out of here.

1224
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:29,051
Out of here?

1225
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:30,989
Oh, Evie.

1226
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:33,780
Has it been so bad?

1227
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:36,987
No, no .. not too bad.

1228
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:39,521
You got used to things you know.

1229
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:41,419
They said you were sick.

1230
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,187
Are you well again?

1231
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:44,559
Sure, sure.

1232
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:46,363
It's them prison doctors.

1233
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,841
They had me in the hospital
ward a couple of times.

1234
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:51,835
Saying there was something wrong
with my heart. What do they know.

1235
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,887
They ought to be listening
to it now with you here.

1236
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,490
It's beating perfect.

1237
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,905
Bill.

1238
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,125
There is ..

1239
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,545
There is something I want to tell you.
- You don't have to tell me. I know.

1240
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,900
About everything.

1241
01:01:07,503 --> 01:01:09,082
No.
- Joe Grant told me.

1242
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:10,896
You're living in New York.

1243
01:01:11,457 --> 01:01:13,006
Being a nursemaid for rich kids.

1244
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:16,659
Supporting Jackie and helping my
case with money out of your pay.

1245
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:19,084
There ain't many wives
would have done that.

1246
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,511
I'm glad it's almost over.

1247
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:24,668
It's my turn to take care of you.

1248
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:26,677
I didn't mean that, Bill.

1249
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,174
I meant .. I meant about us.

1250
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,131
You and I ..

1251
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:33,764
Why? What about us?

1252
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:35,724
Things can happen to people.

1253
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:37,910
They can change.

1254
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:40,303
Inside, I mean.

1255
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:43,851
Me .. change my feelings about you?

1256
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,530
No, I'd never do that, Eve.

1257
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:47,966
But ..

1258
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,272
You see.

1259
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:52,719
There ain't much for a fellow
to do here except think.

1260
01:01:53,146 --> 01:01:54,460
And all I ever dream about.

1261
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,642
All I ever prayed for was ..

1262
01:01:57,102 --> 01:01:59,866
Being with you and Jackie
again in the same little house.

1263
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:02,373
And running the same little garage.

1264
01:02:04,643 --> 01:02:06,236
All you ever dreamed about.

1265
01:02:08,197 --> 01:02:09,561
All you ever prayed for.

1266
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:13,094
Of course there was a time when I ..

1267
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:15,227
Wasn't quite sure.

1268
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:17,051
I'd say to myself.

1269
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:19,290
She is so far away.

1270
01:02:19,868 --> 01:02:21,350
Meeting different people and ..

1271
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:23,051
She's so pretty.

1272
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:26,005
What makes you think she'll
ever come back to you.

1273
01:02:27,736 --> 01:02:30,420
Then all of a sudden I remember
what you said eight years ago.

1274
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,554
I'd see you standing there in front
of me with your eyes burning.

1275
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:37,398
And then I'd know that everything
was coming out alright for me.

1276
01:02:39,891 --> 01:02:41,078
And everything is, Bill.

1277
01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:44,606
Everything is coming out fine for you.

1278
01:02:46,898 --> 01:02:48,675
Deep down in my heart
I never doubted it.

1279
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:52,152
Never once in all those years.

1280
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:02,925
Well, I guess that's the last
performance for a while, Sam.

1281
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,947
Yep. I guess you're right there.
- Goodnight.

1282
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:06,308
Goodnight there.

1283
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:15,733
No, Eve. No.

1284
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:19,538
I don't want to go away.
I want to stay here.

1285
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:23,001
Don't you want to see your father?

1286
01:03:23,602 --> 01:03:25,562
No, I don't know him.

1287
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:27,778
But you will.

1288
01:03:28,465 --> 01:03:29,838
And you'll love him.

1289
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:31,358
He loves you.

1290
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:34,624
I don't care. I want to
stay here with mummy.

1291
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:37,474
Please Eve, please, please.

1292
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:38,549
Oh, Jackie.

1293
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,553
But you aren't Eve anymore.

1294
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:41,717
Are you.

1295
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:43,767
You are my mummy.

1296
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:47,020
Tim isn't my mummy.

1297
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:50,648
She is just something else.

1298
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:52,828
Oh, I'm all mixed up.

1299
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:54,669
Please, Eve.

1300
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,378
I want to stay here. Please.

1301
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,249
I know, dear.

1302
01:04:00,594 --> 01:04:02,843
But sometimes we have to do
things we don't want to do.

1303
01:04:03,362 --> 01:04:05,089
Why? Why do we?

1304
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:08,532
It's not sure, baby.

1305
01:04:10,034 --> 01:04:11,452
The part we have to play.

1306
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:15,229
The hardest part in both our lives.

1307
01:04:17,231 --> 01:04:18,458
There is no script.

1308
01:04:20,097 --> 01:04:21,459
There are no lines to follow.

1309
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:25,399
We can't make one mistake.

1310
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:26,909
No, not even one.

1311
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:29,935
What would I have to do?

1312
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,232
You would have to play
the part of a little girl.

1313
01:04:35,923 --> 01:04:37,075
Who's been very poor.

1314
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,633
And your mother was a nursemaid.

1315
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,191
And your father had been away.

1316
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:45,576
Sick.

1317
01:04:46,753 --> 01:04:48,270
And you've come back to him.

1318
01:04:49,392 --> 01:04:51,424
And you are going to be so kind to him.

1319
01:04:52,616 --> 01:04:54,874
And not he, nor anyone else.

1320
01:04:55,873 --> 01:04:57,650
Must ever know about mummy Tim.

1321
01:04:58,721 --> 01:05:00,972
Or about London or the theater.

1322
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:03,626
Or anything else that's ever happened.

1323
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,532
You will have to be
a great little actress.

1324
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:10,938
A great little actress, Jackie.

1325
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:13,236
One of the finest that ever lived.

1326
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,910
But we'd do it together, wouldn't we.

1327
01:05:23,656 --> 01:05:25,706
I bet I'd make an awful mess of it.

1328
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,444
No you won't, darling.

1329
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:34,308
We'll do our best.

1330
01:05:35,277 --> 01:05:36,734
No matter how hard it is.

1331
01:05:37,868 --> 01:05:38,927
Our level best.

1332
01:05:58,207 --> 01:05:58,822
Eve.

1333
01:05:59,213 --> 01:05:59,860
Bert.

1334
01:06:00,204 --> 01:06:02,077
I couldn't let you go
without seeing you again.

1335
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,617
I hoped you wouldn't.

1336
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,171
Eve .. it doesn't come easy to say this.

1337
01:06:07,303 --> 01:06:09,546
But I realize now that you
were right and I was wrong.

1338
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:12,937
There can be something
greater than love.

1339
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:16,074
Something a great deal less selfish.

1340
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:19,062
I couldn't see it that night because ..

1341
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:21,653
Well, I guess I wasn't
big enough, but ..

1342
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:25,380
You are doing this because
that's the kind of person you are.

1343
01:06:26,372 --> 01:06:28,281
I love you even more
for it if that's possible.

1344
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:30,253
Bert.

1345
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:33,281
I want to go with you as far
as that prison, wherever it is.

1346
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,741
And Eve.

1347
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:38,472
If you ever need me.

1348
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,707
If you ever want me.
- I know that, dear.

1349
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:44,799
You've made it a lot easier.

1350
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:46,902
That's what I hoped.

1351
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,377
And remember, if it will
make the rest of it easier.

1352
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:51,481
I'll always be waiting.

1353
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:53,692
I'll never give up hope.

1354
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,162
Never.

1355
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,234
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

1356
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:04,685
Cab.

1357
01:07:05,986 --> 01:07:06,996
Taxi, lady?

1358
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:09,602
Do you know 52nd Street?
- Yes, ma'am.

1359
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:12,383
Do you know each little café
on both sides of the street?

1360
01:07:12,547 --> 01:07:13,362
Yes, ma'am.

1361
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:16,275
Well take me there and
drop me off at each one.

1362
01:07:16,544 --> 01:07:17,903
Are you celebrating something?

1363
01:07:18,173 --> 01:07:18,817
Yeah.

1364
01:07:19,817 --> 01:07:22,335
I'm celebrating my birthday.
I just passed forty.

1365
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,786
Hello, Joe.
- Hello Matt.

1366
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:31,936
Waiting for somebody?
- No. Just looking around.

1367
01:07:32,056 --> 01:07:32,744
Okay.

1368
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,474
Well, hello.
- Hello, Joe.

1369
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,325
And Jackie, do you remember me?
- Hello, Mr Grant.

1370
01:07:49,076 --> 01:07:51,408
Joe, this is Mr Ballin.
He's been awfully kind to us.

1371
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:53,286
I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do.

1372
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:55,869
They're releasing him at noon.
Do you want me to go with you?

1373
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,850
No, I .. I think we'd better go alone.

1374
01:07:58,169 --> 01:07:59,667
Well, you've just about got time.

1375
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:00,964
Thanks.

1376
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:05,935
Goodbye, Bert.

1377
01:08:06,864 --> 01:08:07,753
Goodbye.

1378
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,324
Come on, Jackie.

1379
01:08:35,302 --> 01:08:36,015
Mummy.

1380
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:37,215
What?

1381
01:08:38,639 --> 01:08:39,727
What did you say?

1382
01:08:40,222 --> 01:08:41,237
I said 'mummy'.

1383
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,160
Yes. Yes darling, what is it?

1384
01:08:44,807 --> 01:08:46,402
Keep your head up, mummy.

1385
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:32,263
..s-d..
