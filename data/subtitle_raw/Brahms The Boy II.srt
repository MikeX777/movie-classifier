00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:29,064
Jude?

3
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:34,067
Jude. I'm home.

4
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,848
Turn off the video games.

5
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,360
Jude.

6
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:00,497
Gotcha!

7
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,433
Shit!

8
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,936
Another prank?
Why do you have to keep doing this?

9
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,538
I got you good, didn't I?

10
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,105
You think
you're funny, huh?

11
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:14,107
Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay.

12
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:16,245
Saved by your dad.

13
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,112
- Hi.
- Dad.

14
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,882
<i>What's up, mate?</i>

15
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:22,950
<i>You being the big man of the
house and taking care of your mum?</i>

16
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,752
More like scaring
his old mom.

17
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,353
I used the shoe trick.

18
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,623
<i>The shoe trick.
Now, let me see.</i>

19
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,592
<i>No, I think you must be mistaking
me with someone else, mate.</i>

20
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,694
Real sneaky, you two.

21
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,228
<i>I can't stay long, love.</i>

22
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,431
<i>I've gotta take some clients
out for dinner.</i>

23
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,867
<i>But I just wanted to check in
on my two favorite people,</i>

24
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,637
<i>and let you know that I miss you
both and I love you guys so much.</i>

25
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,237
- Love you, Dad.
- <i>Bye, kiddo.</i>

26
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,140
Later!

27
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,411
You know, it's the third time
this week you've been late.

28
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,245
<i>I know, I know.</i>

29
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,247
<i>I've just got to finish these
deadlines, then I'm done. I promise.</i>

30
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:55,917
<i>When I get back,</i>

31
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,085
<i>maybe I can find a way
to make it up to you.</i>

32
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,288
Well, Friday night,
we do have the nanny.

33
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,458
<i>Oh. Well, then I will see you
on Friday night, lady.</i>

34
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,327
If you're lucky.

35
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:08,932
- Night.
- <i>Good night, love.</i>

36
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,569
Were you really scared, Mom?

37
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,736
I was.

38
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,574
But next time,
let's get your dad.

39
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,577
Okay.

40
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,580
Looks like Mr. Brown
could use a cuddle.

41
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,915
- Mom.
- Hmm?

42
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm too old to still sleep
with a teddy bear.

43
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,287
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

44
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,323
Good night.

45
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,358
Good night, Mom.

46
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,238
Jude?

47
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:10,019
If you're trying to scare me
again, it's not funny.

48
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:13,956
Okay.

49
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,564
Mom!

50
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,967
What are you doing?

51
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:26,602
Mom, don't!

52
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,743
No! No!

53
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:36,646
Jude!

54
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,214
Jude!

55
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,194
Mommy!

56
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:12,247
I thought we could take a
look at some of those toys today.

57
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:17,787
Or perhaps there's something
you'd like to talk about?

58
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,261
You don't like coming here
very much, do you?

59
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,535
But you do understand
why you're here?

60
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,006
You know, Jude,
if you'd like to go,

61
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:41,444
all you need to do is to say,
"I'd like to go now."

62
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:54,822
Five months isn't an unusual time
for this kind of selective mutism.

63
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:57,458
I've seen children
stop talking for much longer

64
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,994
from much less severe trauma.

65
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:02,463
Encourage him to communicate,
but try not to force it.

66
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,297
It has to come from him.

67
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,736
The more we force things,
the more he's gonna pull back.

68
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,806
And how are the two of you
holding up?

69
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,073
We're good, yeah.

70
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,011
As well as we can be.

71
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,481
We're really just trying to focus
on Jude's recovery right now.

72
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,583
Well, I commend
your dedication.

73
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,752
But Jude is looking
to you now.

74
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,523
And if you're not getting
better, he won't get better.

75
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:31,661
Thank you.

76
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:53,449
Another headache?

77
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,421
It's not that bad.

78
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,897
I thought the doctor
had some good things to say.

79
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,233
Yeah.

80
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,204
I think Jude
is a little better.

81
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,741
No. I meant, actually,
about us healing too.

82
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,213
Well, I'm... fine, really.

83
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,883
You never leave the house.

84
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,253
You have nightmares
every night,

85
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,721
and you don't even
let me touch you.

86
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:37,258
I'm... not having
this conversation again.

87
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,794
We've never had
this conversation.

88
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,466
You've never talked about
what happened or how you feel.

89
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,569
What if we went away?

90
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,506
Out of the city,
someplace quiet.

91
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,575
You're already homeschooling Jude.
I can work wherever.

92
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,179
I think it would be a good chance
for us to have a fresh start.

93
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,488
I'll think about it.

94
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,430
What is it, sweetheart?

95
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,519
Liza!

96
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,820
Liza, be quiet!

97
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:40,821
Liza.

98
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,989
Liza.

99
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:43,691
Liza. Liza. It's okay.

100
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,397
It's okay. You're all right.

101
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:53,302
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

102
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,538
It's okay.

103
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,311
I can't do this anymore.

104
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,516
Hiya! I'm Pamela.

105
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,918
Oh, I'm glad you found it.

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
Shall I show you the house?

107
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,122
And what's
this little man's name?

108
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,556
Jude.

109
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,358
He's a little shy.

110
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,562
Oh, well,
I bet we'll be best of friends in no time.

111
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:58,265
This used to be a guesthouse
of a much larger property.

112
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,567
But after the owner of
the manor house passed away,

113
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,637
some city man, no offense,
came and scooped it up.

114
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,239
I think
he was gonna restore it,

115
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:07,375
but I imagine the job
got too much for him.

116
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,076
Lucky for you folks,
though.

117
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,310
Some time
in the countryside.

118
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:11,745
It's perfect.

119
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:13,247
I'll give you a little tour
if you like.

120
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,083
No. I think we can
handle it from here.

121
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,618
Oh. All right.

122
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,319
- Thank you.
- Take care.

123
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,723
Cheers. Bye-bye.

124
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:27,995
So, what do you think?

125
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,397
It's beautiful.

126
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,267
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yes.

127
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:34,438
And what about you,
big boss?

128
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,508
All right.

129
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,478
I vote we try a little...

130
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,448
nature exploration!

131
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,282
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, it's so quiet.

132
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,351
Look at the sun.

133
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:53,789
Smell the air.
That's fresh air.

134
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,124
I bet we'll see loads
of rabbits come spring.

135
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,195
- Maybe even some deer, huh?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,332
Watch your step, mate.
It's slippery.

137
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:11,972
What's that?

138
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:13,477
That must be
the main house.

139
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:16,645
Let's check it out.

140
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:36,897
Look at that.

141
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,366
Wow. Now, that is
what I call a house.

142
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,470
Come here.

143
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:44,071
Come on, Jude.

144
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:45,372
<i>Jude.</i>

145
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,342
Wow.

146
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:51,178
This place must've been quite
something back in the day.

147
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,248
"Glennview Estate."

148
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,318
<i>Jude, come play with us.</i>

149
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,055
<i>Jude.</i>

150
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,725
<i>Come here, Jude. Over here.</i>

151
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,193
<i>Jude.</i>

152
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:07,897
<i>Come over here.</i>

153
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,837
<i>Now, Jude.</i>

154
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,073
We'll have to look it up.

155
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,111
Old house like this probably
got some real history to it.

156
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,249
Sean.

157
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:36,356
<i>Jude, Jude. Help me, Jude.</i>

158
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,760
<i>Jude, Jude, Jude.</i>

159
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,097
<i>Yes, Jude.</i>

160
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,080
Yeah, forget the guesthouse.

161
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,482
I'm moving in here.

162
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:02,718
What do you say, Jude?

163
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:04,454
Jude?

164
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,290
- Jude!
- Jude?

165
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,292
Jude!

166
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,561
Mate, don't run off
like that, please.

167
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,798
You can't run off like that,
not out here.

168
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,499
What's that?

169
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,669
Did you just find that?

170
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,904
Can I take a look?

171
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,409
Oh, my goodness.
It's filthy. Look at it.

172
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:28,944
Whereabouts
did you find it?

173
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,617
Do you wanna keep it?

174
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:36,819
Okay. Let's get it
cleaned up first.

175
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,757
All right. Can't wait to have
this guy in the house.

176
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:05,848
Can I see?

177
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:09,985
"Rules."

178
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:12,855
Huh.

179
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:21,130
I bet you have
a story to tell.

180
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:27,036
Looks like
he wants a friend.

181
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,158
He looks like
he was broken before...

182
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,863
and put back together again.

183
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,005
Okay, let's go to bed now.
Hmm?

184
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:06,574
Come on, mate.

185
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,576
You sure you got everything you need
there, little fella? Yeah?

186
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,678
You just make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.

187
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,348
There's nice, cold beer
in the fridge.

188
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,716
I could use
some of those pj's.

189
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,156
You dressed him yourself.

190
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:34,864
That sounds lovely.

191
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:39,869
Are you hungry?

192
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:42,304
Okay.

193
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,709
I'll make pancakes.

194
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:02,824
I guess it's about time for me
to start my morning commute,

195
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:06,159
all the way down the hallway.

196
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,361
I really hope
there's no traffic, guys.

197
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:11,466
You wanna stop by the office
for lunch today?

198
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,735
Did I mention that I was
just down the hallway?

199
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,303
I'll try to sneak by.

200
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,874
Goodbye, Judester.
Mwah.

201
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,477
And goodbye, uh...

202
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:23,245
Did we come up
with a name for him yet?

203
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,753
"Brahms." Wow.

204
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,188
Like the composer?

205
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,092
That's quite the name.
How'd you come up with that?

206
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,668
Oh, he told you.
Right, yeah.

207
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,338
Well, of course, he did.
Silly me.

208
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,542
All right. Bye, gang.

209
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:54,343
Goodbye, Brahms.

210
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,445
Well, what should we
start with today,

211
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:58,882
math or history?

212
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,591
Okay.

213
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:18,933
<i>Over here.</i>

214
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,202
Wait up!

215
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,940
<i>Right here.</i>

216
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:28,277
<i>This way.</i>

217
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:38,753
Jude!

218
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:41,123
I told you not
to run off like that.

219
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:47,562
This is where you found him?

220
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,234
Oz, get in here.

221
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,404
This is private property.

222
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,271
I'm sorry. We're staying
at the guesthouse.

223
00:19:58,273 --> 00:19:59,941
We were just on a walk.
I didn't know.

224
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:01,842
Of course you didn't.
You're the new family.

225
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:04,414
Sorry, I get a lot of people
snooping around up here.

226
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,514
I'm Joseph. Joe.

227
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:09,349
Um, I tend the grounds
around here.

228
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,521
Part guard, part gardener. This is Oz.

229
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:13,454
I'm Liza.

230
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,188
And this is Jude.

231
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,433
We can put the doll back.

232
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,298
Do you want us...

233
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,636
No, no, no, no.

234
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:31,038
Keep it. No one's
gonna miss it out here.

235
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,007
Just me and Oz these days.

236
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,644
Unless, of course,
you'd like to put it back?

237
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,546
He's a little quiet.

238
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,618
Don't worry about that.
Not much of a talker meself.

239
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:45,185
People think I'm crazy
for living out here on my own,

240
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:47,187
but I'm more sane
than any of them.

241
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:50,323
The real crazies are living in the city,
packed together like a bunch of cattle.

242
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:52,026
Thank you,
but no, thank you.

243
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:54,729
You didn't really have to
walk us all the way back.

244
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,697
Ah, I don't mind.
We're neighbors now.

245
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:58,566
I suppose I'll be seeing
quite a bit of you.

246
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,734
Hey there.

247
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,335
That's a healthy-looking
12 gauge.

248
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:03,305
Or a 12 bore.

249
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,874
I was worried about you.

250
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,341
This is Joseph.

251
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:10,378
Joseph, this is
my husband, Sean.

252
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,979
- Hiya.
- Joseph...

253
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,214
I tend the grounds round here.
Keep the troublemakers out.

254
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:15,916
Caught these two red-handed.

255
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:17,319
Yeah, these two are trouble,
all right.

256
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,689
Well, thanks
for escorting them back.

257
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,727
Right. I'll be off, then.
Let me know if you need anything, yeah?

258
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,595
Yeah. Nice meeting you.

259
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:28,831
Pleasure was all mine.

260
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,601
See you soon, little fella.

261
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,872
Bringing home the local strays
already, huh?

262
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:39,274
He's right there.

263
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:53,056
Look, he insisted on
walking us all the way home.

264
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:55,288
Come on, Oz. Come on.

265
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,626
Nice of him, I guess.

266
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,895
Who the hell buries a doll
in the woods like that?

267
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:02,863
Maybe some weird little kid
put it there.

268
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,197
I don't know, sweetheart.

269
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,400
Yeah, but you weren't there.
You didn't see it.

270
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,805
His entire wardrobe,
in this...

271
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:11,706
coffin thing.

272
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,910
Okay.
So, what do you wanna do?

273
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:18,614
- You wanna take the doll away from him?
- Yes.

274
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,249
No.

275
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:25,886
I don't know.

276
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,254
I just think
it's all a little bit...

277
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:29,257
creepy.

278
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:33,261
I really don't think it's the
doll that's the problem here.

279
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,296
What does that mean?

280
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,264
Nothing. Let's just
finish the dishes, yeah?

281
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,736
I've got some work to do
before we go to sleep.

282
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,272
No, I wanna hear
what you were about to say.

283
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:46,909
What's the problem?

284
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,649
Sometimes I feel like
you use Jude...

285
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,953
to avoid talking about
what happened to you.

286
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,124
And I don't think that's
healthy for either of you.

287
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:09,932
<i>Mommy!</i>

288
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,469
You know, I nearly died...

289
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,473
in some random,
senseless burglary.

290
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,008
And I'm actually aware of that
every single day of my life.

291
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,943
Yes, but that's over now.

292
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,180
Li...

293
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:30,853
Dogs bark.
You didn't like the dog?

294
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:34,989
The dog.

295
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,025
Dogs bark.

296
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,860
I know what you mean.
He was kind of scary.

297
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,895
Liza, I'm sorry.

298
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:42,131
Shh, shh, shh.

299
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,372
Holy shit.

300
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,542
Should we just leave him alone?
Do you wanna open the door?

301
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:56,510
No, I wanna go in. I wanna
see if he'll talk to us.

302
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:57,647
Okay. Let's go.

303
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:00,082
So, all this is yours?

304
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:02,883
Hey, sweetheart.

305
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:06,189
We were just outside,
and we thought we heard you talking.

306
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,391
Were you talking
to Brahms?

307
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,059
Great.

308
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,429
So, what were you guys
talking about?

309
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:24,872
The dog from this morning.

310
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:25,741
Did he scare you?

311
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,017
"Brahms doesn't like him."

312
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:37,920
Oh.

313
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:40,723
Well, that's...

314
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:42,925
that's great.

315
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,129
We'll let you get back
to Brahms.

316
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,565
Good night.

317
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:54,871
Thinking about watching a
movie, if you're interested.

318
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,244
Oh, yeah.

319
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:02,712
Sure.

320
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,419
I guess we're
keeping that doll.

321
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:14,755
Are you kidding? I love that creepy thing.

322
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:31,834
Liza, it's okay.
Honey, it's okay. Look at me.

323
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:34,068
It was just a dream.

324
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,303
Look at me.
It's fine. You're okay.

325
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,706
Jude.

326
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,809
Jude, I'm sorry.

327
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:41,744
He's mine!

328
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,014
You okay?
Another nightmare?

329
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:47,548
Where's Jude?

330
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,884
He slept in his room,
love.

331
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:01,497
This is the first time
he's slept in his own bed.

332
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,200
Come on.

333
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:07,336
Let's go back to bed.

334
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,024
Here you go.
Do you want two, yeah?

335
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:31,594
Does Brahms want two?

336
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:35,295
Hey, good morning.
You're up.

337
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:37,064
I let you lie in.

338
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,768
It seemed like
you could use it.

339
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,371
Thank you.

340
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,307
Cooked up
a little Full English.

341
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:47,243
Here you go, love.

342
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,079
- What's this?
- Oh, that. Yes.

343
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:56,216
Well, apparently, Brahms
is handing down rules now,

344
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:58,120
including
he'd like his own food.

345
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,464
"Always and forever"?

346
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,472
Oh, dear.

347
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:51,974
What happened
to Mr. Brown?

348
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,946
Jude, buddy,

349
00:28:57,713 --> 00:28:58,781
did you do this?

350
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:02,716
Come on, mate.

351
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:04,785
It's not very nice
to blame him now, is it?

352
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:07,621
Look, we're not mad at you.

353
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,892
But this is no way
to treat your things.

354
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,827
And it's never okay to lie.

355
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,165
So, did you cut up
Mr. Brown?

356
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:23,505
Okay. Then why don't you go to your
room and finish your homework there?

357
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:25,509
And then when you're ready to tell
me what happened, you can come out.

358
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:38,654
You can leave
the doll here.

359
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:41,422
Jude.

360
00:29:41,424 --> 00:29:42,858
You heard your mum.
Leave the doll, please.

361
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:01,074
Maybe it's a good thing.
He's getting his anger out.

362
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,415
It's pretty violent.

363
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,652
Really?

364
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:24,291
That wasn't funny.

365
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:26,293
You're supposed
to stay in this room

366
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:28,797
and not come out again until
you're ready to apologize.

367
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:39,875
Fine. You can stay in here
for the rest of the day, then.

368
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:21,418
Aaah!

369
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,857
Jude,

370
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,762
your father and I
said no doll.

371
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,933
Okay, I am gonna count to three,
and if this door isn't open...

372
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,367
One...

373
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,736
two...

374
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:15,638
three.

375
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,814
What are you doing here?

376
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,510
Hey.

377
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:57,146
I have someone here
who wants to apologize.

378
00:33:58,914 --> 00:33:59,816
Come on.

379
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:03,185
Hey.

380
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,801
Thank you for apologizing.

381
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:26,707
Okay. Let's get you
to bed, yeah?

382
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,143
Go brush your teeth.
Good boy.

383
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,784
You okay?

384
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:38,855
Not good.

385
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:42,857
I could've sworn I saw somebody
go into his room, and then...

386
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:44,459
You didn't. It's fine.

387
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:45,895
Honestly, his pranks
are getting out of hand.

388
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:49,129
Yeah, but I thought
everything would be better

389
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,668
once we got out of the city.

390
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,706
I don't know what to do.

391
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:01,009
I just feel like
I'm letting you and Jude down.

392
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,811
You're not
letting anyone down.

393
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:06,213
Please don't be sorry.

394
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:07,515
You'll feel better
after some sleep.

395
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:08,518
Yeah.

396
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,384
Good night.

397
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:11,486
All right.

398
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:36,243
<i>I understand that some of Jude's
recent behaviors would be upsetting.</i>

399
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:42,015
<i>But the doll clearly is providing him
with a safe outlet to process his trauma.</i>

400
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:45,419
<i>Now comes the hard part,
where he might try to act out some more.</i>

401
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:46,721
Act out?

402
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:48,255
Listen, what if we just
got rid of the doll?

403
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:49,857
How bad would that be?

404
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,291
<i>I urge you to be patient</i>

405
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,895
<i>and allow him
to have his friend.</i>

406
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:56,964
<i>He's found a place with this
doll where he feels safe.</i>

407
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:00,066
<i>And the last thing we want
to do is take that away.</i>

408
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,637
<i>I'll send you some links
with further information.</i>

409
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,572
Okay. Sounds good.

410
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:06,273
Thanks, doc. We'll speak
to you soon, yeah?

411
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:07,408
<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

412
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,380
Perfect.

413
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,551
There you go. Nice.

414
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:18,821
Come on, Jude.

415
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:22,590
That's it. Once.
Then move it on.

416
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:23,493
Perfect.

417
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,267
Hello, Jude.

418
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,606
What you got there?

419
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,640
Okay.

420
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:13,977
You thought of a name
for him yet?

421
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,013
What is it?

422
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:28,456
Course it is.

423
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,894
Because that's his name, isn't it?
What else would it be?

424
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,899
You've scrubbed up well,
little man.

425
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,572
So, I see you've found
yourself a new family.

426
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,050
How're you doing,
little fella?

427
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:03,024
Just look at that expression
on his face.

428
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:06,496
It's like he's got a secret
that only he knows.

429
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,500
Do you ever notice that?

430
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,869
Can I help you?

431
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:16,070
Hello there.

432
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:19,205
I was just looking for Oz,
my daft dog.

433
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,675
We haven't seen him.

434
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,175
All right, never mind.

435
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,746
Pretty good idea
where he'll be, anyway.

436
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,682
Right, I'll be off.

437
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:27,784
You be good now.

438
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:34,090
Come on.
It's time to go inside.

439
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:48,703
You left Jude
outside all alone?

440
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:50,272
I just left him for a second.

441
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,316
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

442
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,587
I just saw it.
It was just there.

443
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:47,555
- I'm sorry.
- My God, Liza.

444
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:48,257
What are you doing?

445
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,187
Jude?

446
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:51,988
"I'll always be with you"?

447
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:56,058
"They will be sorry."

448
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:12,675
Sorry.

449
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,945
I didn't know
you were standing there.

450
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:21,317
Why are you wearing that?

451
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:27,456
Dinner's in 15.

452
00:42:57,053 --> 00:43:00,056
No. It's just the three of us
for dinner tonight, Jude.

453
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:03,991
No, not tonight.

454
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:05,661
Does it really matter,
Liza?

455
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,038
Your mum said no, mate.

456
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:23,312
So, I was thinking of inviting Liam
out, and the family.

457
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,681
Felt like maybe
we could use some company.

458
00:43:27,683 --> 00:43:31,585
No? You wanna see your Uncle Liam,
Auntie Mary and your cousins?

459
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:34,822
I think it'll be fun.
He's always a good laugh, isn't he?

460
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:36,359
I think he'd love
to get out of the city.

461
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:39,927
Not really guests.

462
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:41,195
They're family.

463
00:43:41,197 --> 00:43:42,863
Yeah?

464
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:45,001
Your dad and I make the rules
in this house, not your doll.

465
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:53,109
Mm-mmm. Eat it.

466
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:55,876
All right, come on.
Enough.

467
00:43:55,878 --> 00:43:57,445
No, it's fine.

468
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:59,915
You can sit here until you
decide you can eat your food.

469
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,687
Just do as your mum says,
please.

470
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,362
Look, I can handle this.

471
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,933
It's okay.
It's fine. You have work to do.

472
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:38,455
Well, if you won't talk to
me, will the doll?

473
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:43,759
That's because Brahms
is not a person.

474
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:47,895
He's not real.

475
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:50,733
He doesn't need any food.
You do.

476
00:44:58,307 --> 00:45:00,910
The doll and his rules
do not run this house.

477
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:16,192
Fine.
Stay here all night, then.

478
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:47,957
What?

479
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:51,992
Jude.

480
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:52,895
Jude.

481
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:56,298
Liza, what in the hell
happened?

482
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:11,579
Look, I believe you,
I do.

483
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,381
It's just...

484
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:17,184
So, some scary drawings.

485
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:19,688
It's not really surprising, is it?
Considering what he's been through.

486
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,656
The drawing of the dog.

487
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:23,692
The dog?

488
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:25,593
There is no dog here.

489
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:28,162
There was one. And others.

490
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:31,599
Sean, there was a drawing of Jude
standing over our dead bodies

491
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,700
and he was holding a gun.

492
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:36,839
So you're saying he ripped
pages out of his book?

493
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:39,041
No, I...

494
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:41,875
I don't know what happened.

495
00:46:41,877 --> 00:46:45,212
I just know that I want
that doll out of our house.

496
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:48,182
Look, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.

497
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:50,385
No, I don't want it here.

498
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,855
I don't like
what it's doing to Jude.

499
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:56,692
What?

500
00:46:57,726 --> 00:46:59,529
I mean, all of this.

501
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:03,197
This is a lot for a little
kid, don't you think?

502
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,367
This isn't a light table,
for starters.

503
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,403
Are you asking me
if I did this?

504
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:10,938
Somebody's done this.
You're the only person in here with him.

505
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,576
No! Something
is happening to him.

506
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:17,110
And it started with that doll.

507
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:19,782
Fine. We'll get rid of
the doll in the morning, okay?

508
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:23,752
What are we gonna
do about them, Brahms?

509
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:29,559
Oz! Where are you, boy?

510
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:43,172
Come here, Oz. Come here, boy.

511
00:47:58,254 --> 00:47:59,656
Oh, Oz.

512
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,603
Lovely. I need that.
Thank you.

513
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:15,503
Ready?

514
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:17,306
Yeah. Let's do it.

515
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:21,944
Morning, mister.

516
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:24,947
No.

517
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,020
Sean.

518
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:35,157
Jude!

519
00:48:36,158 --> 00:48:37,224
Come on, buddy!

520
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:38,728
It's not funny, Jude!

521
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,497
I'll go this way.

522
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,165
- You head off that way.
- Okay.

523
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,503
We'll circle round.
We'll meet back at the house.

524
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:48,638
Jude!

525
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:51,171
Jude!

526
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,374
Jude!

527
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:04,113
Jude?

528
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,240
Jude?

529
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:35,678
Jude.

530
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:45,755
Jude?

531
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,827
Jude? Is that you?

532
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:54,363
Jude, what are you doing?

533
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:02,971
Jude, where are you?

534
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:15,951
Look, Mommy.

535
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,888
Over here.

536
00:51:21,223 --> 00:51:23,025
Come play with us, Mommy.

537
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:24,587
Jude?

538
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:23,780
Jude.

539
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:34,254
I'm sorry I scared you.

540
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:37,324
- We were just playing, Mommy.
- It's so good to hear your voice.

541
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,471
There you are.

542
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:52,274
Been looking all over for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

543
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,942
No.

544
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:57,378
Jude. What the hell are
you doing in here? It's not safe.

545
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,313
I'm sorry, Daddy.

546
00:53:59,549 --> 00:54:00,817
Jude, he's...

547
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:03,316
You're talking.

548
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:04,885
Right, let's go.

549
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,687
We're not really supposed to
be in this part of the house.

550
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:07,557
Come on.

551
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:14,030
It's so nice
to hear you talking.

552
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:26,409
Joseph,
what happened in this house?

553
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:31,179
Jude, why don't you go
show Brahms the music room?

554
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:33,016
Stay close, mate.

555
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:35,752
There, uh...

556
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,254
There was a family that
lived here a long time ago.

557
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:43,424
Had a son, went a bit mad.

558
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:45,026
Killed a little girl.

559
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:48,429
Got burnt up in fire.
Wore a mask to hide it.

560
00:54:48,431 --> 00:54:50,731
Lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years.

561
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:52,232
Never came out.

562
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:53,403
The Heelshires?

563
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:55,438
Yeah, the Heelshires.

564
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,007
And?

565
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:02,009
And the parents
committed suicide.

566
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:03,077
Drowned themselves.

567
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,747
It's a very sad story.

568
00:55:05,615 --> 00:55:07,448
And the son?

569
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:11,052
Well, it all got a bit
messy after the parents had gone.

570
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:14,287
He killed a man,
very nearly two others,

571
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:16,392
before he was killed himself.

572
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:19,595
But they're all dead
and buried now.

573
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:23,933
What's the son's name?

574
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:27,937
His name was Brahms.

575
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:31,439
Did you say Brahms?

576
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,306
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

577
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:35,945
I just didn't think
it'd ever come up.

578
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:38,548
Thank you for telling us.

579
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:43,152
Come on, Jude.
It's time to go home.

580
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:49,257
Hey, Joseph?

581
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,761
Did you ever find your dog?

582
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:54,161
Yes, I did.

583
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:56,432
I'm afraid Oz was found
gutted in the forest.

584
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,138
I'm sorry to hear that.

585
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,612
<i>So, your parents tell me
you've been talking again.</i>

586
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,749
<i>Is this your new friend
Brahms?</i>

587
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:17,019
<i>He seems like
a very nice friend.</i>

588
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:21,122
<i>What are some of the things
you talk about?</i>

589
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:24,925
He... tells me
all sorts of things.

590
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:28,361
Sometimes he tells me about the
other families he's lived with.

591
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:30,967
<i>Oh. Has he lived
with a lot of families?</i>

592
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:35,268
He wants to live
with us now.

593
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,439
He was very angry that Mommy and
Daddy wanted to take him away.

594
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,640
<i>Oh.</i>

595
00:56:39,642 --> 00:56:41,142
<i>And when Brahms gets angry,</i>

596
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:44,781
<i>does he say he wants to
hurt someone or something?</i>

597
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:51,988
<i>Is there something he wants
to tell your mum and dad?</i>

598
00:56:56,058 --> 00:56:59,126
<i>Well, if Jude had something
to do with the dog's death,</i>

599
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:02,362
<i>then this is a lot more
serious than we thought.</i>

600
00:57:02,364 --> 00:57:05,032
<i>The doll might be enabling him
to shift blame</i>

601
00:57:05,034 --> 00:57:07,201
<i>for all the bad things
that he might do.</i>

602
00:57:07,203 --> 00:57:11,639
<i>I think it would be a good idea
for me to see him face-to-face.</i>

603
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:14,074
<i>When do you think you can
bring him down to London?</i>

604
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:16,844
We've got guests coming today,
but we'll bring him as soon as we can.

605
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,712
<i>All right, then.</i>

606
00:57:18,714 --> 00:57:21,316
<i>But I urge you,
keep a close eye on him in the meanwhile.</i>

607
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:53,346
Jude! Everyone's here.

608
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,348
- Anything goes. Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

609
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,052
This is just fabulous!
I love it.

610
00:57:58,054 --> 00:57:59,555
Hello.

611
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,759
Well, look. There he is.

612
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:08,629
You remember your old Uncle
Liam, don't you?

613
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:10,731
- Hey.
- What? It's not my fault he's mental.

614
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:11,934
Shh, shh, shh.

615
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:17,370
And...
who's this handsome chap?

616
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,540
Brahms.

617
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:22,376
Well. Hello there, Brahms.
Pleased to meet you.

618
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:24,914
Any friend of Jude's
is a friend of mine.

619
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:28,816
Okay, children,
why don't we go outside and play

620
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:30,718
while we all have a catch-up.

621
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,919
Yes.

622
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:33,988
There's nothing to do outside.

623
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,623
There's nature. All right?

624
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,292
It's like a video game,
but real. Go, enjoy.

625
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:39,795
Come on, Jude.
Show them around.

626
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:45,099
- Maybe I should go with them.
- Nonsense. They'll be fine.

627
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:46,736
Just stay close
to the house, guys.

628
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:50,439
- This is so cool.
- Shut up.

629
00:58:54,677 --> 00:58:55,910
I like your doll.

630
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:56,812
Thanks.

631
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:03,918
This place sucks.
There's nothing to do here.

632
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,419
We could play croquet.

633
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:06,987
I wanna play.
Come on.

634
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:08,858
Don't touch him, Sophie.
He's mental.

635
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,959
No, I'm not.

636
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:15,296
My parents say you talk to that
doll, like it's a real person.

637
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:18,432
Because you went crazy
when your mum got attacked.

638
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,634
And we're not supposed
to notice.

639
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:21,835
Will!

640
00:59:21,837 --> 00:59:25,205
But they know you're mental.

641
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:28,042
And I know you're mental.

642
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,044
And your stupid doll,

643
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,347
he's the most mental of all.

644
00:59:40,356 --> 00:59:42,024
He's fine, Liza.

645
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:44,894
Have some wine.

646
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:50,130
It'll do him good to hang out
with some other children.

647
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,067
Yeah.

648
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,037
I'm sorry.

649
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:00,309
Ever since it happened,
I just...

650
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:05,312
I can't seem to relax.

651
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,214
Hey, you're with family now.

652
01:00:07,216 --> 01:00:09,018
You don't have anything
to worry about.

653
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:12,389
And Will won't let
anything happen.

654
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:16,690
Hey, you're breaking it!

655
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:19,727
- Shut up, nutter.
- Stop it, Will!

656
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,598
Oh, you're sticking up
for your nutter boyfriend now.

657
01:00:26,669 --> 01:00:29,169
Maybe I should
just smash your doll.

658
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:31,839
- Maybe that will make you normal again.
- Don't.

659
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:33,907
We get to this party,

660
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:35,776
and we have literally
just walked in the door,

661
01:00:35,778 --> 01:00:39,046
and his pants split
right in the bum.

662
01:00:39,048 --> 01:00:42,049
And not just a little tear,
the whole bum!

663
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:43,617
I'm going to tell Mum!

664
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,054
She'll probably be happy.

665
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:47,554
Don't touch him.

666
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:49,223
Or what?

667
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:52,094
Or he'll make you wish
you never came here.

668
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:54,595
Did you buy him purple boxers?

669
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:56,431
I did.

670
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:57,698
Kinky.

671
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,435
It's good to see
that smile again, Liza.

672
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:01,471
That old smile of yours.

673
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,540
- Give it back!
- Nah, I don't think I will.

674
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,108
Give it back to her.

675
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:10,911
Ooh, now your boyfriend's mad.

676
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:12,913
Why don't you come get it
from me, mental?

677
01:01:12,915 --> 01:01:15,450
I wouldn't worry
about this doll thing.

678
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:17,651
Will used to be obsessed
with this blanket.

679
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:18,986
Run, mental, run.

680
01:01:18,988 --> 01:01:20,222
Stop it, Will!

681
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,157
Obsessed.

682
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:27,561
Then one day I realized that it was
quite literally a security blanket.

683
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,630
I think this doll
could be the same thing.

684
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:31,265
Come on, mental.

685
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,734
You shouldn't worry about it,
is what I'm saying.

686
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:36,070
Kids do all sorts
of weird things.

687
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:38,072
They go through phases.

688
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:39,474
And then poof, it's gone.

689
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:12,608
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's going on?

690
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:14,343
Will!

691
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:19,547
Easy, on three. One, two, three.

692
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:20,714
Mind his head!

693
01:02:20,716 --> 01:02:22,349
Slowly. Slowly.

694
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,120
Mary, help
with his head, okay?

695
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:27,855
Will, I'm coming in.

696
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:29,291
Sophie, get in the front.

697
01:02:57,554 --> 01:02:59,753
Sweetheart, why don't you
drink some of this?

698
01:02:59,755 --> 01:03:01,054
It'll help you sleep.

699
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:02,658
A nap will do you good.

700
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:09,231
Okay?

701
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:16,071
There you go.

702
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:21,611
Mommy.

703
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:30,853
Everything's okay.

704
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,291
He won't let me go.

705
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:40,961
He wants me to live in the
big house with him forever.

706
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:44,800
He said he'd kill you and
Daddy if I didn't do it.

707
01:03:46,902 --> 01:03:47,903
He said that?

708
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,043
When did he say that?

709
01:03:55,978 --> 01:03:57,880
He says it all the time.

710
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,616
I can't control him
anymore.

711
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:03,653
He keeps getting stronger.

712
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:06,720
Well,

713
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,625
no one's gonna hurt
Mommy and Daddy.

714
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,327
And no one's gonna hurt you.

715
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:13,396
Okay?

716
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:11,151
Hey, Liza, it's me.

717
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:13,887
We just saw the doctor.
I think Will's gonna be okay.

718
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:16,056
So, I'll call you
from the car.

719
01:05:16,058 --> 01:05:17,226
All right.
I love you. Bye.

720
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:51,392
Not from around here,
are you?

721
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:52,893
I'm staying
at the Glennview Estates.

722
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,229
Glennview?

723
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:58,499
Oh, you mean the Heelshire place.

724
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:01,103
Christ, you couldn't pay me
money to stop there.

725
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,740
- You what?
- You don't know?

726
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:08,710
Whole family went
completely mad out there.

727
01:06:08,712 --> 01:06:12,014
Something to do with a son living
inside the walls for years.

728
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,127
You see, but that's not the only
thing that happened out there.

729
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:30,864
There were other
tragedies before.

730
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:36,303
Back in the '50s, a kid killed
his own mother and brother,

731
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:38,575
convinced a doll
was speaking to him.

732
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:48,215
And it's still going on.

733
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:52,886
Last year, that city man that
bought it after the Heelshires

734
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:55,322
went a bit mad
and disappeared.

735
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:57,324
Never heard from again.

736
01:06:57,326 --> 01:06:59,761
I saw him down the pub
one time.

737
01:06:59,763 --> 01:07:01,895
Old crazy Joe.

738
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:03,230
Crazy Joe?

739
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:04,931
That's what people
called him, mind.

740
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:05,835
His name were Joseph...

741
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:45,305
Oh, my God. Jude!

742
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:46,275
Jude!

743
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,710
Jude!

744
01:07:51,313 --> 01:07:52,181
Jude!

745
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:58,353
Didn't have to be like this.

746
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:03,058
Joseph.

747
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:05,728
Is Jude okay?

748
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,499
Don't worry. He's safe.

749
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:14,404
Safer now than he's probably
ever been in his life.

750
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:16,138
Why are you here?

751
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:20,175
I'm here because
he wants me to be.

752
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:22,044
Who?

753
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:24,346
Brahms.

754
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:30,918
He doesn't like it like this,
but you've done it to yourself.

755
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,352
I just wanna know
where my son is.

756
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:34,187
I will do anything you want.
Just give me my son.

757
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:36,089
I want you to listen!

758
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:38,495
He wants you to listen!

759
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:42,998
You asked me why I'm here.

760
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,535
It's the same reason
that you are.

761
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:48,368
He called me.

762
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,507
He calls out to the ones
that need him.

763
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:53,374
The damaged ones.

764
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:55,244
He looks inside you.

765
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:58,180
It was just a whisper...

766
01:08:59,516 --> 01:09:00,850
at first,

767
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:03,520
when I first came here.

768
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:05,220
So quiet.

769
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:08,923
And he was in pieces
when I found him,

770
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:10,292
broken.

771
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:13,796
And then the voice said...

772
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:16,031
to put him back together.

773
01:09:18,635 --> 01:09:19,936
So I did.

774
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:28,308
Then I heard him,
growing inside.

775
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,144
You must've heard it.

776
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:33,783
Jude sure has. Oh, yeah.

777
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,617
I don't know what Brahms is,

778
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:39,087
but you can stop this.

779
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:41,455
It's too late.

780
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:45,225
Brahms and Jude are gonna be
one, and it'll be beautiful.

781
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:47,397
Everybody thought
that I was crazy.

782
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:50,733
They thought the Heelshires were
crazy, but, oh, no.

783
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:54,003
It's always been the doll.

784
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,841
Even before the house, before the
Davies, the ones before that.

785
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,108
I found all their old letters.

786
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:05,415
He knew that you were coming.

787
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:09,819
He knew your boy
would find him.

788
01:10:11,353 --> 01:10:13,754
That's why he told me
to bury him.

789
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:16,124
They're always so curious, aren't they?
The little ones are like...

790
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:19,493
like moths to a flame.

791
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:22,130
Joseph, where is my son?

792
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:24,599
I wanna see my son!

793
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,336
He's in the big house!

794
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:40,282
Jude!

795
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:45,989
Jude!

796
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:50,460
Jude!

797
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:13,583
Jude.

798
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:17,652
Jude?

799
01:11:17,654 --> 01:11:19,154
<i>Over here.</i>

800
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:39,509
<i>This way.</i>

801
01:11:58,293 --> 01:11:59,462
<i>We're just over here.</i>

802
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:37,133
Jude...

803
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,012
I know you don't
wanna hurt anybody.

804
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:54,117
This isn't you, Jude.

805
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,756
Please, put him down.

806
01:13:01,758 --> 01:13:03,358
It's going to be okay.

807
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:07,597
Can I hold Brahms?

808
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:26,983
I used to hold you
just like this.

809
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:33,623
Let's just put him down.

810
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:46,836
Hello, Mommy.

811
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:52,742
Jude, put the gun down.

812
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:56,412
We're very angry.

813
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,715
You and Daddy
have been getting in the way.

814
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:04,352
We're going to
live here now...

815
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:07,423
because you can't protect us.

816
01:14:09,192 --> 01:14:10,526
Protect you from who?

817
01:14:11,427 --> 01:14:12,360
That dog.

818
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:14,897
Will.

819
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:19,168
And those men from that night.

820
01:14:21,204 --> 01:14:22,271
You're right.

821
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:26,442
- We do need Brahms to protect us.
- It's too late.

822
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,111
You've given us no choice.

823
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:31,745
Goodbye, Mommy.

824
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:36,252
I know Brahms
is telling you what to say.

825
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:41,889
Which is why we need to
take him home with us.

826
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,393
Brahms needs to be
a member of our family.

827
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:48,931
And what kind of a family
doesn't need a mother?

828
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:08,217
Mom?

829
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:17,426
Jude.

830
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:20,830
What have you done?

831
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:24,100
What have you done?

832
01:15:25,268 --> 01:15:26,168
Stay back.

833
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:31,672
It's me he'll punish.
I'm the one who didn't protect him.

834
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:32,907
No, no.

835
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:34,911
Joseph, Brahms can't
hurt you anymore.

836
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,280
You don't understand.

837
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:39,415
It will never be over.

838
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,403
It's gonna be
all right, Brahms.

839
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,487
Mom! You're home.

840
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:01,155
Yes. I missed you.

841
01:18:01,157 --> 01:18:02,890
- I missed you too.
- Really?

842
01:18:02,892 --> 01:18:04,758
- Perfect timing.
- Hey.

843
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,126
Hey, beautiful.
How was your day?

844
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:07,761
It was good.

845
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:10,631
I think we might sign that
author I was telling you about.

846
01:18:10,633 --> 01:18:12,266
Yeah? Nice!

847
01:18:12,268 --> 01:18:13,501
All righty.

848
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,437
- This looks so good.
- Thank you.

849
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:17,671
Wait until you taste it,
because I'm pretty confident

850
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:21,608
that this might be the greatest coq
au vin ever made upon English shores.

851
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,343
I'm not even joking.

852
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:25,447
There's a whole bottle of wine in
here, so I'm not sure if...

853
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:27,081
No, okay.
I will give you some.

854
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,849
- Thank you.
- All right.

855
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,150
This looks so good.

856
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:31,585
Thank you.

857
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:33,787
Just two or three hours
of my day. Nothing much.

858
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:36,824
Is it my turn tomorrow?

859
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:38,360
Yeah. Cheers.

860
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:41,263
Good night, my man.
You sleep tight.

861
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:44,698
I love you, sweetie.

862
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,935
Love you too.

863
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,340
Good night.

864
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,099
Good night, Brahms.

865
01:19:51,601 --> 01:19:53,503
I think we'll be happy here.

866
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,772
If they learn the rules.

867
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:02,708
