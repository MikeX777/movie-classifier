00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,669
Whew! I think
that's everything.

3
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,205
Come here.

4
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,747
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

5
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,084
Oh, come on.

6
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,395
Shit.

7
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,612
- Fired? You're firing me!
- Get the fuck outta here.

8
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:45,482
Oh, fuck you, Manny!
I quit! How 'bout that?

9
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,651
- Give me my fuckin' shirt.
- You want your shirt back?

10
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,821
Great news. You can have your
piece-of-shit shirt back.

11
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,489
Here ya go, dude.
Choke on it.

12
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,593
Hey, where's my stuff? You
guys have my stuff in there!

13
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,694
Oh, great, you too, Gary?

14
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:58,965
Fuckin' dick.

15
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,965
Hey, what do you need?

16
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,134
- Um, a mechanic. I'm looking for a mechanic.
- Great.

17
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,871
You just found the best goddamned
mechanic in town! Let's go.

18
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,872
I'm driving to LA
and my car broke down.

19
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:11,042
- Those guys would've fuckin' ripped you off.
- Really?

20
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,710
- Oh, okay.
- Eat shit, Manny!

21
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,780
- Richard, by the way.
- Oh. Nathan.

22
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,782
Everyone calls me Nat.

23
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:28,259
Hey, you mind if I, uh, take a
couple of, uh, pictures of you?

24
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,660
- You wanna take a picture of me?
- Yeah, yeah, of you.

25
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:33,730
You're uh...
you're interesting, you know?

26
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,266
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,901
I mean, don't get me wrong, dude.
I'm interesting as fuck.

28
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,004
- Yeah.
- If you wanna take a picture of the real deal,

29
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,771
like, you came to the right place.
Let's do this.

30
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,206
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

31
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,576
- Awesome. Great.
- This is crazy.

32
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,578
- Okay.
- Fuck, yeah.

33
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,848
- Nice.
- Yeah, right?

34
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,249
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,020
This is America
at its purest, dude.

36
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,690
Oh, nice. Okay.

37
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,090
Yeah.

38
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,093
- Cool, man. Let me see 'em.
- Huh?

39
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,896
- Let me see 'em.
- No, this is... It's a film camera.

40
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,263
- It's film.
- Oh, yeah.

41
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,999
- Cool, man. Wow.
- Developing and everything.

42
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,533
Yeah.
That's old school, huh?

43
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,701
- Yeah, yeah.
- Crazy.

44
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,271
What are you,
an artist or something?

45
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,773
I'm gonna start art school.
That's why I'm driving to LA.

46
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,107
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

47
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,211
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,112
- What's your philosophy?
- My philosophy?

49
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,881
Yeah, like, your
artist's philosophy.

50
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,083
What's your outlook on the world?
What do you got to say?

51
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,886
Uh... I don't know.

52
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,855
I mean, listen,
I'm not an artist.

53
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,759
I'm like a fuckin' piece of
shit, you know. I'm a zero.

54
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,727
- But even I've got a philosophy.
- Uh-huh.

55
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,728
Three things matter in life.

56
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,198
Friends, shelter, and a little
bit of food in my belly.

57
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,737
Everything else, bro... is fuckin'
bullshit, and I'm at war with bullshit.

58
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,105
- Everyone hates bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Right?

59
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:53,009
If there's one thing I learned
in my 35 years on this planet,

60
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,013
it's that this world
is full of fuckin' bullshit.

61
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,949
Hey! Here we go.
Get ready.

62
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,218
- Start it up.
- Oh. Oh. You sure?

63
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,823
- Yep. Start it up.
- Okay.

64
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,859
- You ready?
- Yeah.

65
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,597
- Boom!
- Oh, my God, yes!

66
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:14,732
Thank you.

67
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,367
How 'bout that?

68
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,102
I really appreciate it.

69
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,170
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Just a loose hose. Nothing.

70
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,372
Yeah. Thank you. I never
would've found it myself.

71
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:25,076
Listen, it's just, like, I don't
know, maybe a hundred bucks?

72
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,145
Yeah, yeah. Of course, man.
Uh...

73
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,848
- I'm fuckin' with you, man.
- What? What the...?

74
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,383
I'm fuckin' with you.
Don't worry about it.

75
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,953
Oh, my God, dude, that's so generous.
Thank you.

76
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,756
- I wish there was something I could do for you.
- Oh. There totally is.

77
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:42,893
I'm going about 45 minutes up
the road, town called Alpine.

78
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,162
- Okay.
- If you wouldn't mind just giving me a ride.

79
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,665
You can drop me on the side of the
highway near the town. That'd be fine.

80
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,232
I just need to get there
pretty quick.

81
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:53,069
Um... I don't...
I don't know, man.

82
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,905
Yeah.

83
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,040
- I don't know you...
- Enough said. I get it. You don't know me.

84
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,944
You know, I'm a stranger.
You don't want me in your car.

85
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,179
But look. Look in my eyes, man.
I have very kind eyes.

86
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,984
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm a good guy.

87
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,322
- What d'ya say?
- Um...

88
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,391
You know what?
Yeah. Yeah, hop on in.

89
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,263
- Come on.
- Fuck, yeah! Yes! You just made my day, man.

90
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,365
You want a road brew?

91
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,735
No-no, I'm good. I, I don't, uh...
not while I'm driving.

92
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,705
- But you're more than welcome to do it.
- All right.

93
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:33,276
You know, keep it low, just in case
there's any, uh, cops or anything.

94
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,847
Don't worry about it. I'm pretty much at
professional level at drinking and driving.

95
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,317
Well, good
thing you're not driving.

96
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,286
So what's
your story, you party?

97
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,322
Yeah. I mean,
I go to parties often.

98
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,060
- What?
- Nah.

99
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,762
I don't mean, do you go to
parties, like a sweet 16.

100
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,765
I mean, do you party,
like, do you do drugs?

101
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,469
- Cool. Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah. Weed and drink.

103
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,038
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,473
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah?

105
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,376
'Cause I happen to have
a pretty rad jazz cigarette.

106
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,245
- Wow, that's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,448
- You wanna piece of this?
- No, I'm driving. I don't smoke...

108
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,253
- Mind if I smoke it?
- No, not at all. Please, go for it.

109
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:15,955
So, where you headed, man?

110
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,990
- Vegas.
- Vegas.

111
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,194
Yeah. Bright lights,
beautiful women.

112
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,295
- Cool.
- It's the perfect place to start over.

113
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,131
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

114
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,766
Yeah. I've never
been to Vegas.

115
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,935
- You've never been to Vegas?
- No, no, no, no, no. Never.

116
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,271
- Oh, dude, you gotta go to Vegas.
- Yeah. I know.

117
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,439
I wanna go
for my 21st birthday.

118
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,375
I know it's clichÃ© and
all that, but, you know?

119
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,044
- Dude, that's smart.
- Right?

120
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,346
- All of the best stuff in Vegas, you gotta be 21.
- Yeah.

121
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,982
The bars, the casinos,
gambling, strip clubs.

122
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,352
Dude, all the best hookers
are at strip clubs.

123
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,520
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,122
- Uh, good to know.
- Oh.

125
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,790
Thank you.

126
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,160
Maybe if I'm there, I'll look
you up and we can hang out.

127
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,465
Yeah. Sure.

128
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,366
Tell you what.

129
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,068
I'm done
with all this bullshit.

130
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,237
Nothing for miles,
small-town nonsense.

131
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,039
Fuckin' assholes at work.

132
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,940
Shitty jobs.

133
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,345
Fuckin' terrible people.

134
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,017
Vegas, baby.
From that movie?

135
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,955
So, it's this building
right here.

136
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,091
- Oh, awesome.
- Yeah.

137
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,226
- Pull up right here on the right.
- Great.

138
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,227
Thank you so much, Nat.

139
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,396
This is... You really
did me such a solid.

140
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,899
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

141
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,133
- You take care of yourself.
- You take care of yourself.

142
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,336
This baby's gonna get you to LA
no problem now. Don't you worry.

143
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,938
Thanks to you, man.

144
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,806
Keep your dick dry out there.
You know what I'm saying?

145
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,940
- Okay.
- Wrap it up.

146
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,045
All right.
I will.

147
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,356
Fuck!

148
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,234
Hey, man, what's up?

149
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,534
The whole thing's closed.

150
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,502
I don't even think the fuckin'
busses come here anymore.

151
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,271
- What the hell?
- What?

152
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,306
Yeah. Fuck me.

153
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,578
Oh, shit, man. Well, uh,
what're you gonna do?

154
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,514
I-I'll probably just stay here the
night, and hitch in the morning.

155
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,118
It's, like, not a big deal.

156
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,122
You know what? Um, I'm
staying in Marfa tonight.

157
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,324
If you wanna join... I don't
know if they have a bus station,

158
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,593
but it's closer to Vegas.

159
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,294
- You wouldn't mind, for real?
- Yeah, man.

160
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,616
It'd be nice
to have some company.

161
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,165
Okay. Here's one.

162
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,333
What's your favorite movie
of all time?

163
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,901
<i>The Graduate.</i>
Done.

164
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:45,870
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,203
- Never seen it.
- Really?

166
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,939
I don't even know what it is.
<i>The Graduate?</i>

167
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,607
- Dustin Hoffman. You know...
- I'll check it out.

168
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,476
What about you?
What's your favorite movie?

169
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,213
Uh, <i>Fast and Furious:
Tokyo Drift.</i>

170
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,083
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. That movie is crazy.

171
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,184
It's about these guys
and they race all these cars.

172
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,554
And they, like,
they drift the cars.

173
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,290
I mean, they're... they're all right...
those movies, to be honest.

174
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,324
- I mean...
- <i>Fast and Furious One and Two?</i>

175
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,227
Fuckin' the best movies
I've ever seen.

176
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,663
I mean, they, like,
they lost their steam,

177
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,631
like, by the time
they got to, like, six.

178
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,333
I think they're on,
like, eight now.

179
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,334
Wait.

180
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:20,036
There's more
of those fuckin' movies?

181
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,572
Yeah. There's,
like, eight more.

182
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,107
Are you fucking...
Oh, my God!

183
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,642
- Yeah, they added...
- That's fuckin' amazing!

184
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,343
They got Dwayne
"The Rock" Johnson.

185
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,646
- The Rock...
- Yeah.

186
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,747
- ...from wrestling...
- Yeah.

187
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,282
- ...is in <i>The Fast and Furious?</i>
- Yeah, I mean, yeah.

188
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,918
Fuck. He's like
my favorite wrestler...

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,319
It was sad when the guy
died, the main guy.

190
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't tell me.

191
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,290
- Who... In the movie?
- No, no, not in the movie.

192
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,190
- Vin Diesel?
- Not Vin Diesel, the other guy,

193
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,525
- but in real life.
- Brian?

194
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,295
- Yeah.
- Brian died in real life?

195
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,229
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Wow.

196
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:49,466
They CGI'd his face 'cause he,
like, only shot half of the movie,

197
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,202
and they did the rest
with his brothers.

198
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,469
Very touching.

199
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,475
- Dude, you are fucking blowing my mind.
- Yeah.

200
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,443
We need some tunes
up in this bitch, right?

201
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,977
Yeah, oh, totally.

202
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,478
- Let's get it goin'.
- My girlfriend...

203
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,982
Well, ex-girlfriend, gave me
this iPod as a going-away gift.

204
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,218
- All right, let's see what we got.
- Yeah, check it out.

205
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,987
Any Aerosmith on here?

206
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,488
Uh, I don't know. I haven't
actually looked at it.

207
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,125
Well, I hope there is, because
I'm in the mood for Aerosmith.

208
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,694
- Ooh. I have an update.
- What?

209
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,229
Your ex has shit taste in music.
This is garbage.

210
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,564
Yeah. No, I know.

211
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,633
There's, like, three Indigo
Girls records on here.

212
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,202
Is that why you dumped her?

213
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,703
- 'Cause I get it.
- No.

214
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,439
No, no, no, no, no.
She, uh, she dumped me.

215
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,407
Or, well, no,
it was kind of mutual.

216
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,043
She made the decision.
Um...

217
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,179
Ew. This is
not sounding good.

218
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,647
No, no, no, no, seriously.
It was the right decision.

219
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,382
So I'm-I'm totally fine
with it.

220
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,017
Say no more. I get it.

221
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm just excited to start this
new phase, this new path.

222
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,189
Yeah.
You should be.

223
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,757
You're going to
fuckin' art school, dude.

224
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,593
'Cause you know what
art school is full of?

225
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,130
Hot girls, who, like, have those
weird, chunky, black glasses

226
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,532
- and, like, black bangs and all this shit.
- Yeah, it's...

227
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:59,569
All they're into is, like, doing threesomes
and being lesbians for a minute.

228
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,271
- Wow.
- Like, you're gonna get crazy-laid.

229
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,573
You eat pussy, dude?

230
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,242
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

231
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,579
If there's one thing you walk away from this
conversation with is, you've gotta eat that pussy.

232
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:12,549
You know, it's like, my-my last girlfriend,
she didn't really like getting eaten out...

233
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,550
Okay. Time out.
Time out.

234
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,520
Time out. I'm gonna
stop you right there.

235
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,323
She likes getting eaten out.
You're just bad at it.

236
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,757
Well, here's the thing, okay?

237
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,327
The honest truth, you want
the honest truth right here?

238
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,194
She's the only person
I've ever been with.

239
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,131
Oh, dude, that's
not embarrassing.

240
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,032
You're fuckin'... What are
you, 19 years old you said?

241
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,601
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's fine.

242
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,535
Fuck, I wish I had that.

243
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,417
I fucked a bunch of dummies before I
fucked the one true love of my life.

244
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,441
Shit, man.

245
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,746
This is embarrassing. Fu... Fuck. I can't
even believe I'm about to tell you this.

246
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,580
No, come on, tell me.

247
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,785
I'm still, like, hung up on this
girl from when I was 15 years old.

248
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,554
- I'm talkin' like 25 years ago, man.
- Wow.

249
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,723
My high school sweetheart...
Sharon was her name...

250
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,426
Ooh. She had, like,
this beautiful angelic face.

251
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,130
- We just got each other. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,299
I feel like in an
alternative universe,

253
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,670
- we'd be married and have kids and be real happy, you know?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,073
It's, like, there was
this fork in the road,

255
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,775
and on one side was this
beautiful paradise with Sharon,

256
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:18,582
and on the other fuckin' side, is
just, like, 25 years of fuckin' shit.

257
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:23,120
And I don't know why, but I fuckin'
chose the 25 years of shit.

258
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,722
And sometimes I'm laying in
bed, trying to fall asleep,

259
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,391
and I just think about
that universe with her,

260
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:31,328
where it's just us
and we're happy.

261
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,131
And I don't know what the
fuck happened, man. You know?

262
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,535
Wow.

263
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,329
Dude, is this the hotel?

264
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,798
Yeah. I rented out
one of those trailers.

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,766
Oh, no. I spent my whole life trying
to get out of a fuckin' trailer park.

266
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,736
Now you're gonna make me
sleep in one again?

267
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:17,406
What is this, some kinda fake poverty
bullshit your generation's into?

268
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:22,179
I know it's corny and all,
but, you know, it's just fun.

269
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,881
Hey, I gotta check in. Do you wanna come
in with me, or do you wanna wait out here?

270
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:29,152
Uh, no thanks. I saw
a bar couple blocks back.

271
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,324
- Why don't you meet me there in 30.
- Uh, okay.

272
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,723
- Richard.
- Hey.

273
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,225
- Hey, how's it goin', man?
- Good. What, did you get lost?

274
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,495
Oh, no. That ex I was telling
you about, she called.

275
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:16,232
- Dude, you gotta cut her loose.
- I know.

276
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:19,269
- You're over 21, right?
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,470
What'll you have?

278
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,840
- We'll, uh, we'll get two whiskeys.
- Yep.

279
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:28,214
- Holy shit, I didn't get carded.
- Yeah, okay, be cool.

280
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,380
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, thank you.

281
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,719
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

282
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,523
Oh!

283
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,291
- We'll do two more of these. Make 'em doubles.
- Yeah.

284
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,293
Thank you.

285
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,797
- Mmm.
- Fuck.

286
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,800
- What?
- I'm sorry, dude.

287
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,669
- I just did a real fuckin' dick thing.
- No, what did you do?

288
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,373
I ordered a bunch of drinks, and I've
only got ten bucks in my pocket.

289
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,308
Oh, come on, don't worry about it, man.
I got the drinks.

290
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,443
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

291
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,777
You've already been
so fuckin' nice to me.

292
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,945
Giving me a ride,
and all this other stuff.

293
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,513
It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

294
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:05,915
- No, no, no.
- What?

295
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,617
Don't flash that kind of
money in a place like this.

296
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,319
- What'd you do, fuckin' rob a bank?
- No.

297
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,887
Jesus Christ.

298
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,523
- Are you fuckin' rich?
- No.

299
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:15,695
Oh, thank you.

300
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,427
Your parents are rich.

301
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,365
- Well, I mean, they're like upper-middle class-ish.
- Right?

302
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,635
I fuckin' nail... I nailed it, man.
I got your number.

303
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,404
So, I've had, like,
a pretty sheltered life.

304
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,606
Everything's
planned out for me.

305
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,309
You do well on your SAT's.
Graduate high school.

306
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,043
You go to college.
You get a job.

307
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,379
You get married.
Blah, blah, blah.

308
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,885
And that's fine for some people, but that
type of life doesn't interest me at all.

309
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,587
Yeah, I get it.

310
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,422
No one had a plan for me.

311
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,990
Nobody fuckin' expected
anything out of my life.

312
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,424
Yeah. And-And see?
That's-That's my point.

313
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:53,430
You're one of the realest people I
think I've ever met in my entire life.

314
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,831
And I-I guess that's what I'm
trying to do with my photography.

315
00:18:55,833 --> 00:19:02,472
I'm trying to get to... to the-the
heart of real America, you know?

316
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,741
And I feel like being
in here in this place

317
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,944
with you right now, with all these people
around, that this is real America.

318
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,479
Nat, I have an update.

319
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,915
I think this might be
the asshole of real America.

320
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,483
You're a good kid, Nat.
I like you.

321
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,653
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

322
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,922
I think the universe brought us
together for a reason, you know?

323
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,456
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,059
I will fuckin' rip the condom
off of your mind, dude,

325
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,797
so you can fuck this world raw.

326
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,700
I wanna see you fuckin'
raw-dog this world, man.

327
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,934
That's what you're doing.

328
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,080
Fuck the world raw.

329
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,116
Did you guys
just fuckin' see that?

330
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,818
- Fuckin' kid just took our photo.
- That's funny.

331
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,387
Hey. You just take
my fuckin' photo?

332
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,357
What the fuck
are you thinkin'?

333
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,058
I-I'm sorry, yeah.

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,626
What the fuck are you doin'?
Erase that.

335
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,463
Got any fuckin' manners?

336
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,831
This is a film camera.
I can't erase it.

337
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,633
- Give me the fuckin camera.
- No, stop!

338
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,869
Hey, leave the kid alone, okay?
He didn't mean anything by it.

339
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,138
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it, huh?

340
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,943
Okay. Just go back to your game
and play pool with your bros.

341
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,845
Uncle Joe, Ryan, come here.

342
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,746
You wanna meet my boys?

343
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,548
Hey, Richard. Come on. Let's go.
Let's just leave.

344
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,849
Oh, no, no.
Hang on, Nat.

345
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,586
I'm about to meet
Uncle Joe and Ryan.

346
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,889
You are.

347
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,559
Richard.

348
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,596
Richard, come on, let's go.
Please. I'm so sorry.

349
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,667
Richard, please?
I'm so sorry.

350
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,837
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna go.

351
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,107
- What do you mean you're gonna fuckin' go?
- I'm sorry.

352
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,410
Thank you, ma'am.

353
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,414
- Sorry for the disturbance.
- Fuckin' pussy.

354
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,781
- Ooh. One sec.
- Li'l fuckin' baby.

355
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,984
What?

356
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,090
- Oh, my God!
- Run!

357
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:00,657
Go, go, run!

358
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,664
I think we lost 'em.

359
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,032
Oh, my God.

360
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,135
Did you see that guy's
face when I hit him?

361
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,604
Oh, fuck, man.

362
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,740
- That... That was... That was cra...
- Did you get your camera?

363
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,474
Yeah, I got it.
I got my camera.

364
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,876
That was crazy though.

365
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,979
That was not crazy.
That was just a bar fight.

366
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,080
Come on. You've never
been in a fight before?

367
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,549
How are you
so calm right now?

368
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,917
How are you not?

369
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,220
You know what?
Drink the rest of this, okay?

370
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,455
- You need to relax, buddy.
- Yeah.

371
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,991
I'll be back here,
taking a piss!

372
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,461
Hey, don't come back here
unless you wanna see my dick.

373
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,801
I don't wanna see your...
Ha ha! I'm so drunk right now.

374
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,703
Hey, you think those guys
are gonna find us?

375
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,805
The guys from the bar?

376
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,674
Fuck, no. And by the way,
if they do, guess what.

377
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:52,842
We'll just kick
their fuckin' asses.

378
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,109
- Yeah? That's right.
- Boom!

379
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:57,617
- You fuckin' hit him so fuckin' hard.
- Yeah.

380
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,753
Whoo.

381
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:05,989
I'm pretty fuckin'
hydrated today.

382
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,125
Hey, man, you ever thought of
getting in touch with that girl

383
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,761
- that you're still in love with?
- Who, Sharon?

384
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,830
- Uh, Sharon.
- Fuck, no. Why would I do that?

385
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,032
Well, because you're
still in love with her.

386
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:19,168
You haven't tried to contact her once?
That's crazy.

387
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,139
I've looked her up. But we had a pretty
bad falling out, so what's the point?

388
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,242
You know where she lives
though, you looked her up.

389
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,877
- Yeah, I looked her up.
- You looked her up.

390
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,180
- Fine. Yes, I looked her up.
- So you know where she lives.

391
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,182
Where does she live?

392
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,716
Where does she live?

393
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:38,187
227 Lojitas Lane.
Las Cruces, New fuckin' Mexico.

394
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,556
Okay? You happy now?

395
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,124
That's right off the I-10.

396
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,760
- We should go visit her.
- No.

397
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,962
Yes. Yes!
It's on the way to Vegas!

398
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,665
No matter what, you're gonna drive
by there, so why not say hi?

399
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,534
Why? Because I was a piece
of shit back then, okay?

400
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,738
And, yes, I'm still a piece of shit,
but a very different piece of shit,

401
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,572
one I would rather
she didn't see.

402
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:59,778
- Just hit this and stop bothering me, okay?
- Okay. Here.

403
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,215
You're bumming me out.

404
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,919
I don't know, man.

405
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,624
- You think I'm ugly?
- What?

406
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,992
- I'm ugly.
- No!

407
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,793
- I'm ugly now.
- No, no, no.

408
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:22,699
When she knew me, I looked like
a good-lookin' kid, you know?

409
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:27,604
I look in the mirror now and there's a
old, ugly-ass man staring back at me.

410
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,174
I'm balding,
my hair is going gray.

411
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,096
I'm shocked I get laid as much as I do,
which is, by the way, quite a bit.

412
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,080
I don't think women
like me for my face.

413
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:41,017
I think they just like the danger.

414
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,652
- Oh, that's real sensitive...
- Can't breathe!

415
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,154
You know what?
You're a fuckin' dick.

416
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,257
You know what?
Fine. Fine!

417
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,924
Fine, We'll go,
we'll see Sharon,

418
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,260
then we'll see
who has the last laugh.

419
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,794
So funny.

420
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,632
All right, done.
We're done here.

421
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:55,732
Time for bed.
Shut up.

422
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,771
Wow.

423
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,010
Oh, that's beautiful.

424
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,311
- Oh, fuck. Birds?
- What?

425
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,848
- What's wrong with birds?
- Oh. Nothing.

426
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,283
No, no, Richard.
What's wrong with birds?

427
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,719
Let's just go.
Come on.

428
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:19,289
No, no, no. Richard.
Tell me. Come on, dude.

429
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,390
Birds like that usually
means a storm's coming.

430
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:23,827
It's an old Hopi legend.
Let's just go.

431
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,864
Storms. Storm?
I don't see any storm.

432
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,699
Yeah, well it doesn't
have to be a literal storm.

433
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,768
It can be a metaphorical
storm or some shit.

434
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,039
Let's just
get on the road.

435
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,241
Goddamn it. Come on!

436
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,611
All right.

437
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,184
It's really cool

438
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,654
that you know all about the Hopi
legend and stuff like that.

439
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,289
Yeah, you're not doing your duty as a
goddamn citizen of the United States

440
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,357
if you don't know
all the old Indian legends.

441
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:01,397
Hopi, Apache, Sioux, Iroquois,
Choctaw, Cherokee.

442
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,100
I mean, come on, these are the people whose
land we stole, whose women we raped.

443
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:08,871
Not my ancestors.
I'm one-eighth Jewish.

444
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,674
Besides, I don't think you're supposed
to call 'em "Indians" anymore.

445
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,944
I think the proper term
is "Native American."

446
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,818
Your generation
is 100 percent pussies.

447
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:48,174
- Think we're here.
- Fuck.

448
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,944
All right, let's slow down
with those, all right?

449
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,479
- Oh.
- How many...

450
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,947
Oh, dude,
I'm fuckin' nervous, okay?

451
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,853
I'm in a real vulnerable state right now.
I need your support.

452
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,962
- How do I look?
- You look great.

453
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,799
You look fantastic.
You got your good shirt on.

454
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,067
You...
You're doing great.

455
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,203
- You mean that? You're not just saying it?
- No, I'm not just saying it.

456
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,206
You look good.

457
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,541
Fuck. Did you just see that? She
just walked past that window.

458
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,409
- Did you see that?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

459
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:28,978
And what are you waiting for?
Come on.

460
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,512
Come on, big guy.

461
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:31,783
- Okay.
- You got it.

462
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,082
Here we go.

463
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,385
Whoo. Wish me luck.

464
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,419
- All the luck.
- Okay.

465
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,421
Oh, boy.

466
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,359
Oh, God.

467
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,199
- I can't do it. Let's just go.
- What?

468
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,500
What are you
talking about?

469
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,001
Let's get out of here!

470
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,904
- No. You gotta do it.
- Come on, man.

471
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,505
I don't wanna
be here anymore.

472
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,442
This is... What're you doing?
What're you doing?

473
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,411
- Oh!
- Richard, you're making me do this.

474
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,946
Do not go in...
Do not touch that door.

475
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,248
- Fuck!
- For your own good.

476
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,616
Dude.

477
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,618
No, I...

478
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,261
- Who are you?
- I'm Ashly.

479
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:19,328
- Do you know Sharon?
- Yeah. She's my mom.

480
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,330
Oh.

481
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,637
Is she here?

482
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,177
No, actually,
she's, um, she's dead.

483
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,378
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

484
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,348
Yeah, she died last year.

485
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,617
Fuck. How?

486
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,153
- She killed herself.
- What?

487
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,521
Slit her wrists in the bathroom
and I was the one who found her.

488
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:47,557
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, fuck.

489
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,892
I'm so sorry.

490
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,559
Hey, who's at the door?

491
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:51,930
Oh, hi, Mom.

492
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,899
- Hi.
- Sharon?

493
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,568
Wait.
You're not dead.

494
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,435
Dead?
Oh, what the fuck? Ashly.

495
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,507
- Whatever.
- Can I help you?

496
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,542
It's Richard.

497
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,078
- I'm sorry. I think...
- Wait!

498
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,413
I think you have
the wrong person.

499
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,481
No, no, no!

500
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,219
It's Richard, from high school.

501
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,290
Richard. Oh. Wow.

502
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,024
- In the flesh.
- It's you.

503
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,626
- It is.
- And who's this?

504
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,094
This is my friend, Nat.

505
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,596
- Uh...
- That's Sharon.

506
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,063
Nathan, but I go by Nat.

507
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:30,666
- Yeah.
- Nathan, hi. Hello. Come in.

508
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,403
Uh, you sure we're not
bothering you or anything?

509
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,038
No. Come on in. Please.

510
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
- Hi.
- Hello.

511
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,078
- This is a surprise.
- Very nice to meet you.

512
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,511
Wow.
Is everything okay?

513
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,212
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

514
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,949
No, we were just, you know,
driving through town,

515
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,717
and, you know, Facebook sent me a
message that you lived near here,

516
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:52,120
so I figured I'd stop by and
see if you wanted to catch up.

517
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:55,023
- Facebook doesn't do that.
- Ashly, go do something.

518
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,193
Well, I'll be in my room,
if you care or whatever.

519
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,162
I'm sorry my daughter's
such a fucking brat.

520
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,563
- Oh, that's okay.
- You know what?

521
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:04,402
I was actually about to open up a
bottle of wine, if you want some.

522
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,569
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

523
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,370
- That sounds great.
- You want some too?

524
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:11,340
Uh, ye... No, no.
I'm fine, thank you.

525
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,309
So, wait.
He's not your son?

526
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,411
Him? No.

527
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,114
- Richard, hey, I'm gonna just be in the car.
- Yeah, I don't care, Nat.

528
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,118
Yo!

529
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,387
Come here.

530
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,259
Shut the door.

531
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,134
- Uh, ca... Should I?
- Yeah, totally.

532
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,672
Just throw all that shit
on the ground.

533
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,706
Okay.

534
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,380
You smoke?

535
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,583
Uh, no.
No, I'm fine.

536
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,386
- What do you think they're talking about?
- Huh?

537
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,355
What do you think
they're talking about?

538
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,522
Uh...

539
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:03,059
- Who's this?
- That's my husband.

540
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,061
Oh.

541
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,630
- Seems like a real asshole.
- What?

542
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:12,601
Uh, he's a lucky guy, huh?
Have all this.

543
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,569
- That's great.
- Yeah.

544
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,138
What's goin' on over there?

545
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,609
That is, I am studying for
my real estate license.

546
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,579
Really?

547
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,646
Yeah, really. Why?

548
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,580
Come on.
That doesn't add up.

549
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:28,617
Not the Sharon I knew.

550
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,655
Sharon with purple hair, whose
favorite phrase was "fuck off."

551
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,090
Who gave me a hand job under the
bleachers at the homecoming game.

552
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:36,626
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

553
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,428
- I haven't thought of that in so long.
- But you remember, right?

554
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,731
Isn't it so funny when you
look back at the past,

555
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,267
and you're, like, "Oh, my God,
I thought that was intimacy."

556
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,836
You just, like, stabbing me with
two fingers over and over again.

557
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,204
You were always like, "Cut your
fingernails," all that shit.

558
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,740
I was like, "This hurts!"
That was...

559
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,311
- The greatest.
- ...weird.

560
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,248
So, you from around here?

561
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,085
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm from Texas.

562
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,653
But I'm moving to LA.

563
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:08,156
I cannot wait to get the fuck out
of here the second I turn 18.

564
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:10,225
Yeah, really?
Where you gonna go?

565
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,596
Anywhere.
Just not here.

566
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,697
I'm so sick
of my dumb friends

567
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:19,868
and my dumb parents
and my dumb teachers

568
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,871
and my dumb job
down at The Cone Zone.

569
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:25,407
Maybe I'll go to LA too.

570
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:29,148
I'll be an actress or on a reality
TV show or something like that.

571
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,183
Hey, can you stay,
like, right there?

572
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,118
Um...

573
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,319
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Yeah?

574
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,288
Everyone always tells me
I should model.

575
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,459
Oh, okay. Great.

576
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,434
- How old are you, again?
- Fifteen.

577
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,804
Well, I will be in two months.

578
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:54,806
Mm-hmm.

579
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:02,147
- Thanks.
- I'm on Instagram.

580
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,549
Ashly Richards 42069.
Tag me.

581
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,685
Can I get some more of that?

582
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,521
- Richard.
- Oh, man!

583
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,825
Why are you here?

584
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,595
Oh.

585
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,298
Of course.
Why am I here?

586
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,533
Uh...

587
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,138
I just...

588
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:31,440
- I feel like I never...
- You don't have to...

589
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,242
...said it then, and it's what you
always wanted to hear, but...

590
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,614
- No. You did say it.
- I love you, Sharon.

591
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,348
I've always loved you.

592
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:44,723
You know, you're the...

593
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,424
You're the love of my life,
you know?

594
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,724
- Richard...
- And...

595
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:50,893
Oh.

596
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,761
When I see you here now,

597
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:58,201
I realize this is the life
I was supposed to have.

598
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,502
- You know, don't you ever feel like that?
- Richard.

599
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:04,339
That, like, in another world, you and
me would be living in this house,

600
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,342
and we'd have kids,
and we'd have a happy life.

601
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:08,911
Richard,
I think you should go.

602
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,246
Wait. Because
I said I loved you?

603
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,748
No. I...
That... Uh, sorry.

604
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,884
That... I'm-I'm try...
I'm trying to explain myself.

605
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,353
- Wait-wait, no. I don't... I don't wa...
- I want you to take this...

606
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:20,389
- What's that?
- ...and just go.

607
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,857
What the fuck is that?

608
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,826
- This... I'm just trying to help you.
- What the fuck?

609
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,295
- Dude, I don't want your fucking money.
- Richard. Okay. Calm down.

610
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,398
That's not why I'm here! I'm trying to
tell you I'm fucking in love with you.

611
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,233
- I don't want your fuckin' money!
- Okay, Richard,

612
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,802
I want you to... No, no, no!
Richard.

613
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,737
No, please don't...
Don't touch me, okay?

614
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,304
No. No, I'm not
touching you.

615
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,840
- If you kiss me, you'll remember.
- What?

616
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:38,940
You'll remember
what we had!

617
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:40,275
When we were laughing!

618
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,744
Please get out
of my house, Richard!

619
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,478
Seriously, you're scaring me.
Okay?

620
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,949
- Out of my house.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

621
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,784
- Nat, let's go.
- What?

622
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,422
You're a fuckin' bullshit
person, living a bullshit life.

623
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,824
Your shitty little house
and your bullshit husband,

624
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:58,628
- and your fuckin' mean tricks-playing daughter.
- Okay.

625
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,895
You know what?

626
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,563
When you're tired of
your fucking plastic life,

627
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:03,699
just remember out there, there's
a man who fucking loves you,

628
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,270
who'll always love you.

629
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,340
I-I'm so sorry.

630
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,942
Don't tell your father.

631
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,780
Oh, my God.

632
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,319
Fuck... me.

633
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,755
I need a fucking drink.

634
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,891
Why is there no fucking
booze in this car?

635
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,860
Okay, just calm down, and then
tell me what happened, okay?

636
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,962
- What happened in there?
- What happened was it didn't work, Nat!

637
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,665
It didn't fuckin' work!

638
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,969
Your big idea,
it didn't fuckin' work!

639
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,904
I never would've come here
if it wasn't for you.

640
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,973
Look, I-I feel awful.

641
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,608
Just tell me
what I can do, okay?

642
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,811
- You wanna make it up to me?
- Yes, I wanna make it up to you.

643
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,681
You can get me a hamburger,
and a 12-pack of beer.

644
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:53,883
- Okay. Sure.
- Make it a case.

645
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,389
I haven't eaten fast
food in, like, ten years.

646
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:05,427
My school made me watch this animal
cruelty video and, oh, I think it...

647
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,462
- Hello?
- No, hey.

648
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:08,831
Don't fuckin' yell at them.

649
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,733
I'm not even yell...
I just said, "Hello."

650
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,668
When they're ready, they'll say what's up.
Don't yell at them.

651
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,971
- I literally just...
<i>- Thank you for choosing Bob's Burgers.</i>

652
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,773
<i>Would you like to try
our famous taco burger?</i>

653
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,407
Yes, we would.
Thank you.

654
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:20,909
Uh, let's see.

655
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:24,679
Two taco burger combos,
one Frito pie,

656
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:28,516
and then, uh,
six-piece chicken nuggets.

657
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:31,587
- <i>One four-piece chicken nuggets...</i>
- No-no, six... six-piece chicken nuggets.

658
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,121
Hey, hey, hey.
Be nice.

659
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,056
Six-piece, please.

660
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,559
<i>Okay, your total's
gonna be $15.27.</i>

661
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,661
- <i>Please drive to the second window.</i>
- No, stop! Stop! Thank you!

662
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:41,764
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?

663
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,768
He wasn't fuckin' done. You don't fuckin'
just take off. You say fuckin' "Thank you."

664
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,802
I'm gonna say thank you right now.
The second window.

665
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,704
No, you don't know
it's the same guy!

666
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:53,141
You've never worked at one of these
places before, Nat, I'm sorry. I have.

667
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:55,744
Sometimes it's one guy taking the order,
and another guy gives you the food.

668
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,980
You say fuckin' thank you.
You have fuckin' manners.

669
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,884
- I'm sorry this isn't your dad's country club, okay?
- Oh, my God.

670
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,052
But when a guy takes your order
and fuckin' does your food,

671
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,755
you say fuckin' thank you,
you say fuckin' please,

672
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,159
because all day long they're getting
shit from fuckin' assholes like you.

673
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,994
- Goddamn it.
- Okay. Sorry. I didn't mean to be an asshole!

674
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:13,996
- Hi.
- Hi.

675
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,898
- $15.27.
- Yep.

676
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,800
Feel like I have to fuckin'
apologize for your behavior.

677
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:19,971
Okay. Fuck.

678
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,806
They're fuckin' human
beings back there, man.

679
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,708
Fuckin' human beings
making the food

680
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,080
that you're gonna shove
into your stupid fuckin' mouth.

681
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,585
Thank you.

682
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,956
Thank you so much.

683
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,192
Catch.

684
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,862
Whoa, you blew it.

685
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:50,866
Mm! You should come
to Vegas with me.

686
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,668
- Right?
- Um, sure.

687
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,703
We're fuckin' driving there
already.

688
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,505
Like, fuck art school, man.

689
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,139
We can have drinks
with show girls.

690
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:00,074
We can go to the casinos.

691
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:02,811
It'd be so fuckin' fun.
We'd have the best time.

692
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,748
I... I bet we would.

693
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,083
Just two fuckin' hustlers taking
over the-the city and desert.

694
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,585
I'm not a hustler.

695
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:12,621
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

696
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,956
- You're an artist, right?
- Yeah.

697
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,559
Yeah. What's a fuckin'
artist but a hustler, dude?

698
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,663
Get used to it, 'cause that's what you're
gonna be doing for the rest of your life.

699
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,998
- Okay.
- Plus, you know what?

700
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,802
Anybody who wants a piece, guess
what they're gonna get? Boom.

701
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,003
Dude, what the fuck?

702
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm gonna protect you.
Okay?

703
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,942
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- I'm not gonna hurt myself.

704
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,043
- Put the knife away!
- If anybody fucks with you...

705
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:38,179
- Okay. Yep.
- I'm gonna fuckin'... I'll fuckin' slit their throat.

706
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:40,081
- Put the knife away!
- Slit their fu... Okay!

707
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,817
- Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

708
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:45,186
Such a fuckin' baby
about the knife.

709
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:49,895
I'm just showing you that I'm like,
like a big brother, I'm gonna...

710
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,500
'Cause you're like...
I can tell. You're like...

711
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:58,636
scared.

712
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:10,712
I'm gonna sleep
for, like, ten minutes.

713
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:13,849
And then I'll drive
and then you can sleep.

714
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,817
- Okay.
- Okay?

715
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,817
Okay.

716
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:16,951
You're doing a good job.

717
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,987
- You're a good kid.
- Thank you.

718
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,790
You're a good kid, Nat.
You're a good kid.

719
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,596
Just my little brother,
who I'm teaching everything to.

720
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,730
Shit.

721
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,311
Come on.
Okay, come on.

722
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,712
It's time to go.

723
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,315
What's going on?
What time is it?

724
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:23,251
It's late, uh...
It's early morning.

725
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,054
- Okay.
- Yeah.

726
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,121
- Why aren't we driving?
- Because I need to sleep.

727
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:28,958
- Fuck it. Come on.
- Okay.

728
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,159
- I'll drive. I can drive.
- Nope. Let's, uh,

729
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:32,830
let's put you to bed, bud.

730
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,934
This way.

731
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:28,911
Fuck.

732
00:42:35,018 --> 00:42:36,851
What's the matter,
won't start?

733
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,454
Uh, no.

734
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:40,822
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

735
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,925
I'll take a look at it after
we eat our free breakfast.

736
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,395
Right? They got a
waffle bar, you know.

737
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,895
Come on, let's go.

738
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:49,764
I'm fuckin' starving.

739
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,002
Whoo!

740
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,944
- You know you left this on the table upstairs?
- Oh.

741
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,811
You don't have to
tip maids at motels.

742
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,447
They're not actually
cleaning anything.

743
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,252
All they do
is make the bed again.

744
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:34,543
Shit, man, I'm sorry
I couldn't fix it this time.

745
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,779
But, good news is,

746
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,447
the universe just handed us
a day off in a pretty cool city.

747
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:41,785
So, let's enjoy it, right?

748
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:49,491
Get a picture of me
with this barbed wire.

749
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,862
- Uh...
- It's fuckin' tough as shit, right?

750
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:56,301
Yeah, sure.

751
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,904
Oh. Oh, boy.
Here we go.

752
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,208
Classic.

753
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:11,248
- I know what'll fuckin' cheer you up, bro.
- What?

754
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:14,148
Fuck Vegas.
I'm not goin'.

755
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,317
Why?

756
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,518
Because I'm gonna
go to LA with you.

757
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,355
- Right?
- Yeah. That's great.

758
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,058
- I can't believe it didn't occur to me before.
- It's fuckin'...

759
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:28,329
Hello?

760
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:30,234
Yeah, hi, this is Nat.

761
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:34,002
Okay.

762
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,376
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.

763
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,344
Bye.

764
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,579
Fuck.

765
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,581
It'll cost more to fix
the car than it's worth.

766
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,351
Yeah. I'm not surprised.

767
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,119
I'm so fucked. Classes start
in, like, three days.

768
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:54,989
You know what?
I'm just gonna...

769
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,592
I'm gonna go back to the hotel
and call my parents, okay?

770
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,962
Seriously?

771
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:03,197
Things get a little hard and you fuckin'
bail and go call Mommy and Daddy?

772
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,567
- What would you do?
- What would I do?

773
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:09,503
I'd go to the fuckin' bar, have a
couple drinks, fuckin' chill out,

774
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:13,574
and then tomorrow, I swear to God, I
will put you on a bus to LA myself.

775
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:16,878
- Yeah, but what about all my stuff in my van?
- Fuck that stuff.

776
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,947
- You don't need it.
- I need some of it.

777
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,884
Great. Take that and leave the rest.
Who cares? Come on.

778
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,985
Come on, what're you doing?
Come on. Let's go.

779
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,454
You got this. You got this.

780
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:30,358
To LA, man, where everything's
gonna go fuckin' great for us.

781
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,659
If we ever make it there.

782
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:33,464
Oh, we're gonna make it.
Don't you worry.

783
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,299
You need to be more Zen
about how things happen.

784
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,869
You know,
you get real down and...

785
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,938
Can I have a tequila
soda, please?

786
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,139
Can I have a beer, please?

787
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:47,476
- Hey.
- What?

788
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,047
Check out these girls
over here.

789
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,081
That girl just smiled at me.

790
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,650
What about Sharon?

791
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,953
Sharon? Come on, man.
That was yesterday.

792
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,353
I'm moving forward
with my life.

793
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,223
I'm trying to do
something new now.

794
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,927
Where they goin'?

795
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,328
- Let's go talk to them.
- No.

796
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,029
- Come on, come on, come on.
- No, no. I'm good.

797
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,563
I'm gonna just stay right here.

798
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,699
I don't feel like talking
to anyone right now.

799
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,668
What's the matter with you, dude?
Come on.

800
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,371
- No, I'm sorry. I just...
- There are cute girls here and they smiled at us.

801
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,507
- I'm sorry.
- That's a signal.

802
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,509
- Mm.
- You know what? Fine, forget it.

803
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,610
You sit here and mope
while I go talk to those girls.

804
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,947
I'm just saying...

805
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,549
It'd be a lot more fun
if you were there.

806
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:33,422
Hey.

807
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,655
Nice.

808
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:36,391
- This is so stupid.
- I know, right?

809
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,563
Let's do it.

810
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,098
Ladies.

811
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,532
- How ya doin'?
- Hey.

812
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:46,335
I'm Richard.
This is Nat.

813
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:47,735
- I'm Nina.
- Hey.

814
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:49,170
- Hey.
- Rebecca.

815
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,471
You mind if we join you

816
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,074
and maybe get you a drink
or something?

817
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,675
- Absolutely.
- Oh.

818
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,744
- Fuck, yeah.
- Great.

819
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,250
Nat, why don't you go, uh, why
don't you get us those drinks.

820
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,150
I'll come with you.

821
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:04,286
Oh? Yeah.

822
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,490
Okay.

823
00:47:08,257 --> 00:47:10,092
- Hi.
- Four shots of whiskey.

824
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,229
Thanks.

825
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:14,395
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.

826
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:15,565
Yeah, yeah, of course.

827
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,136
Mmm.

828
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,471
- You guys live around here?
- No.

829
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,206
We're just
traveling through.

830
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,474
- Oh.
- Yeah.

831
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,742
What about you guys?

832
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,212
Just doing a little road
trip with my sister.

833
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,712
Nice.
Where you guys headed?

834
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,148
You can keep the change.

835
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,183
- We're driving back to LA.
- Really?

836
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,052
No way.
That's where I'm headed.

837
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,619
Uh, starting college,
art school.

838
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:41,255
Shut the fuck up.
I'm finishing art school.

839
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:43,090
- Really?
- Going into my last semester.

840
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:45,159
- Dude, that's hilarious.
- That's cool.

841
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,262
I know, right? Uh...

842
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,563
- Yeah. I go to Cal Arts.
- What kind of art do you do?

843
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:51,800
I can't believe you guys are
staying in the same motel as us.

844
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,501
- I know. Isn't that crazy?
- That's insane.

845
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,404
- You are?
- Yeah.

846
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,706
- Guys, this is like fate or some...
- Fate.

847
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,808
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?

848
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,277
This is weird.
This is now officially...

849
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,744
- We... Guys, a toast.
- Oh, my God.

850
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,650
All right? A toast to
fate and new friends.

851
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,187
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

852
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,822
Arrrr! Ooh!

853
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,192
- Whoo.
- Ooh-wee!

854
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,360
Oh, uh, so to answer your question.

855
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:20,561
Yeah.

856
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:22,297
Um, I take
a cross-disciplinary approach.

857
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,433
So like, the work exists between
paintings and performance.

858
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,835
- Oh.
- I don't know.

859
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,137
I don't want it to be any
one thing, you know?

860
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,306
Becs, no one understands what
the fuck you're talking about.

861
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,543
What she does is she makes
paintings based on her dreams.

862
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,177
- That's her thing.
- Whoa.

863
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,480
- Oh. Okay.
- I mean, no, it's not that simple.

864
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,848
It's an easier way
of saying it.

865
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,849
No, it's not.

866
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,851
Whatever.

867
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,422
Okay, she's mad at me because she
takes everything very seriously.

868
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,324
He's the exact same.

869
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:53,762
He gets all uptight
about stuff all the time.

870
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:58,300
This might be weird, or like some
junior high shit or something,

871
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,800
but this is a great song.

872
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:01,235
- May I have this dance?
- Yeah.

873
00:49:01,237 --> 00:49:02,837
Fuckin' right on.

874
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,773
I promise I'll bring her back
in one piece. Maybe.

875
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:06,842
Hey!

876
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,110
Uh-oh.

877
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,381
I like you.
You're feisty.

878
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,784
- I'm gonna go get us another round. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

879
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,520
Uh, sure.
Do you...

880
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,123
Do you need...

881
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:36,737
- Oh...
- Okay, here we go.

882
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:38,907
Sorry.
I should've helped you.

883
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,476
Oh. No, it's okay.
I still have a tab open.

884
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,710
You wanna take one?

885
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:43,814
Sure, yeah.

886
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,853
- To art.
- To art.

887
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,331
I have no idea why I agreed
to let her drive with me.

888
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,866
I'm going crazy.

889
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,369
I feel the same way.

890
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,674
It's the grind of the road,
you know? Takes its toll.

891
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,607
Yep.

892
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,179
Oh, my God. I love this song.

893
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:22,349
Do you wanna dance to it,
the song, uh, with me?

894
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:23,817
Yeah.

895
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:27,221
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

896
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:28,790
Okay.

897
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,226
Milady.

898
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,487
Ow!

899
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,395
Hey, Nat,
Richard told me about your car.

900
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:10,864
You guys should just
come with us.

901
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:13,634
They're not listening to you.

902
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,567
You are going to have
so much fun in college.

903
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,900
I really hope so.

904
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,534
You will.

905
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:49,371
I know it's hard to imagine,

906
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,505
but especially since
you're going to art school too.

907
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:56,346
It's... It's an entire school
filled with weirdos, like us.

908
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,786
Hey, can I...
Can I take your picture?

909
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,887
- Right now?
- Come on.

910
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,790
Come on, just stand right there.
It'll be fine.

911
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,458
Uh, but I hate having
my picture taken.

912
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,726
- Oh, why? You're beautiful.
- Oh!

913
00:52:12,728 --> 00:52:15,764
- You're gorgeous. You... You...
- You're...

914
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:18,703
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever met.

915
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,703
- Okay, fine.
- Yeah?

916
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,273
Okay.

917
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:29,744
Amazing.

918
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,715
That was such hard work.

919
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:37,855
Ooh.

920
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:40,755
All right.

921
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,924
Into my room, we go.

922
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,927
Into my room...

923
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:46,927
Whoa!

924
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:49,730
Come on! In or out, guy?

925
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:50,998
Wow!

926
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,637
- Ew! Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh!

927
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,440
- That's incredible!
- I guess we should go to my room.

928
00:52:58,442 --> 00:52:59,844
That's... Oh, my God.

929
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,616
Can I kiss you?

930
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,418
Yeah.

931
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,762
Hey, Nat, get out here.

932
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,663
Wait.
Do you hear that?

933
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,965
N-No.

934
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,040
No, I... I think
there's someone there.

935
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:32,674
Okay.

936
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:37,679
- What do you want, Richard?
- Hey, come here. It's an emergency.

937
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,581
- What?
- Hey.

938
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,550
Don't be a dummy, okay?
Wrap it up.

939
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,918
- Thanks, Richard.
- Hey.

940
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,420
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Okay.

941
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:47,792
Okay.

942
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,893
What did he want?

943
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,465
Uh, who knows?

944
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:57,667
- Hey.
- I'm so tired.

945
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,438
I'm gonna
shut the light off.

946
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,110
- Wait, come here.
- Yeah.

947
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:11,779
Boop.

948
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,850
- Good night.
- Good night.

949
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,074
- Hey.
- Hey.

950
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,476
Took you long enough.

951
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,076
- Well, well, well.
- Hi.

952
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:46,648
Look who decided
to join the living.

953
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,650
- Hey. How ya feelin'?
- Hi. I'm all right. You?

954
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,886
- You were talking so much in your sleep last night.
- I was?

955
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,788
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. I just remembered.

956
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,790
I had the fucking
craziest dream last night.

957
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,659
Yeah. Uh,
I'll tell ya in a second.

958
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,661
Right now, Nat, would you please
join me at the waffle bar?

959
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,197
Great, thanks.

960
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,730
- Uh, oh.
- Hey!

961
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:05,132
Watch it, you.

962
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:07,134
- Don't start something you're not gonna finish.
- Ha ha.

963
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:08,936
- So, yeah.
- So, how'd it go?

964
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,871
Did you use that condom
I gave you, or what?

965
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,105
- No.
- No?

966
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:13,608
- No, I didn't.
- Too bad.

967
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,710
I didn't use anything.

968
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,547
We made out, a little.

969
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,681
- Yes.
- I know.

970
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:21,916
- That's awesome, dude.
- Oh, my God.

971
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,518
- It was so nice.
- Nice work.

972
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,920
So, listen.
I, uh...

973
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,523
I'm gonna need your help
with something right now, man.

974
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,058
Yeah?
What do you need?

975
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,165
Well, I'm about to ask Nina to
marry me, right here, right now.

976
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:38,233
Oh, wait.
You're... You're serious.

977
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,967
Fuckin'-A right on,
I am, dude.

978
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,503
I'm in love with this girl.

979
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,505
I have been since the second
she walked into that bar.

980
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,007
Okay.
Plus, check it out.

981
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,041
- I got her this sweet ring at the gas station this morning.
- No, no.

982
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,143
- She's gonna love it.
- Buddy, I think you're being a little impulsive.

983
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:51,880
- It's happening.
- No, no. You do it at a later time.

984
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:52,980
Ladies.

985
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:58,552
If I could interrupt your
adorable giggling for a second,

986
00:55:58,554 --> 00:55:59,924
I have an announcement.

987
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,826
Nina.

988
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,027
I know that we haven't known
each other that long,

989
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:11,032
and this might seem like it's
coming outta the blue, but...

990
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,034
- What're you doing?
- Richard, hey...

991
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,136
- Shh. Nat, hang on.
- Buddy, nope.

992
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,538
- Hold on. Shh!
- Not right now. I'm in the middle of something.

993
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,009
You know the phrase, "Sometimes
when you know you just know"?

994
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,277
Well, I know.

995
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,213
I love you.
And I can tell you love me.

996
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:33,087
So will you do me the honor
of marrying me?

997
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,592
Oh. Oh, my God, you got
me the special ring.

998
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,661
It's so cute. Did you get
this at the gas station?

999
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,098
Don't laugh.

1000
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,233
- Get up! Come on. Don't be silly.
- No.

1001
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:48,835
I'm serious.

1002
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:50,170
This is real. I...

1003
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,875
Come on, get up.

1004
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,045
Yeah.
No, you know what?

1005
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,779
You don't have to decide now.

1006
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:01,918
I'll-I'll just hold onto
this until you decide.

1007
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,730
Wait. What about, uh...
what about your dream?

1008
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,866
Oh, yeah, your dream.

1009
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,366
Oh.

1010
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:21,703
Yeah. Right.

1011
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,137
Okay.

1012
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:26,306
It's pretty fuckin' crazy.

1013
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:32,246
So, in the dream, I'm on tour
with The Rolling fuckin' Stones.

1014
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:35,616
- Oh, I love The Rolling Stones.
- Of course you do.

1015
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:39,052
Anyway, so, I'm hitchhiking
on the highway, no cars,

1016
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:42,924
and then all of a sudden, huge
black tour bus pulls up, right?

1017
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:46,094
Door opens, so fuck it.
I get in.

1018
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,929
And I come face-to-face
with the guys.

1019
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,163
Keith fuckin' pulls out
a guitar,

1020
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:53,067
hands it to me,
'cause he wants to jam.

1021
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:58,239
Which is crazy, because I know how to
play every single Rolling Stones song,

1022
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,208
even though A,
I don't play guitar,

1023
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,811
and B, I probably haven't listened
to The Stones in like, 15 years.

1024
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,413
Why, you don't like them
or something?

1025
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:09,416
Are you kidding? I fuckin'
love The Rolling Stones.

1026
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:12,753
They're the fuckin' best
rock band in history.

1027
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,788
And before you say anything
about The fuckin' Beatles,

1028
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,357
you can shut
your goddamn mouth,

1029
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,793
because they'd be a hack pop band
without George Martin, okay?

1030
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:22,797
I just don't like what The
Stones stand for, at this point.

1031
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,933
What do they stand for?

1032
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:30,137
They stand for the fact that my
generation, your generation,

1033
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,273
- and their shitty generation has utterly failed to produce...
- Whoa.

1034
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:36,177
...a rock band the caliber
of The Rolling Stones.

1035
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,880
There is no band that people remember
now, never mind in 30 years.

1036
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:42,416
Are you fucking kidding?
Fuck The Stones.

1037
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,117
So let me get this straight.

1038
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:48,021
Because you hate every band but
The Stones, you hate The Stones.

1039
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:49,824
See? You get it.

1040
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,293
And believe me, I'm so fuckin'
tired of women saying

1041
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:56,230
they still find these
old men sexy.

1042
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,166
Like Mick's strutting up there,
and they're like,

1043
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:00,134
"Oh, I'm still fuckin'
turned on by him."

1044
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,103
No you're not.
No you're fuckin' not.

1045
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,038
These are old geezers.

1046
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,940
And even if you found yourself in
some groupie situation with them,

1047
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:08,711
their dicks wouldn't
even fuckin' work.

1048
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:11,945
I'd still fuck Mick.

1049
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,029
- Fuck you, cunt.
- Whoa.

1050
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,496
Rebecca, wait.
Please don't go.

1051
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:33,000
Rebecca, is there any way
I can still go with you guys?

1052
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,402
- Unlock the car.
- I did!

1053
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,503
- Rebecca, please.
- Nina, wait.

1054
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,239
- Richard, don't! Please.
- I'm sorry.

1055
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,308
- I'll do whatever you need.
- Nat, just call me.

1056
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,110
- I don't have your number.
- Becca, just go.

1057
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:43,878
- Nina, I'm sorry.
- Please.

1058
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,512
- Hey! I love you.
- Rebecca, please.

1059
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:47,782
- Get away from the car.
- I love you. I'm sorry.

1060
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,117
- Just open the door. Talk to me.
- Get away from the car!

1061
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,288
Fuck!

1062
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,525
You can't call women
the fuckin' C-word.

1063
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,259
Yeah, well, she just broke
my heart, Nat.

1064
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,862
So I think "cunt" is
the appropriate word.

1065
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,429
I'm gonna go find my way
to LA.

1066
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,532
Oh, you're just pissed because
Rebecca wouldn't fuck you.

1067
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,467
Don't take it
out on me, bro.

1068
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,137
I'm the one who's brokenhearted here.
I'm the one that just got hurt.

1069
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,938
You don't think I see right
fucking through you?

1070
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,007
That you're fucking
using me?

1071
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:18,813
I'm paying for your hotel room,
your food, your fuckin' drinks,

1072
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,482
which, by the way, if you don't
know, you're a fucking alcoholic!

1073
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,416
Shut the fuck up, dude.
No, no, no, no, no.

1074
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:26,420
'Cause you're not paying
for jack shit, little rich boy.

1075
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,123
- Mommy and Daddy are paying for everything.
- Whatever!

1076
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,324
Have fun finding your way
to fuckin' Vegas,

1077
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:33,795
'cause you're not fuckin'
coming with me to LA.

1078
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,797
And you think I'm using you, dude?
No.

1079
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,299
You're fucking using me.
Okay, my image!

1080
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,201
Everything I fuckin' stand for,
for your bullshit fucking art.

1081
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:42,837
Fuck you.

1082
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,005
And what you don't even get
is that I have feelings, dude.

1083
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:47,241
I have feelings just like you.
Okay?

1084
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,944
But you don't even see that because
to you, I'm just some weird dude

1085
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,512
you're slumming it with on the
road, that you can fuckin' use

1086
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:55,148
for stories to get your fuckin'
dick sucked in art school.

1087
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,284
- Fuck you, dude.
- What the fuck are you talking about, Richard?

1088
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,387
Come on, man!

1089
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,087
You're fuckin' handsome.

1090
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:03,023
You're rich.

1091
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:06,159
You're on your way to becoming some
fuckin' big artist or whatever.

1092
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:09,262
And what am I? I'm just some
fuckin' poor, ugly piece of shit

1093
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:11,199
on his way
to an early grave.

1094
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,534
And here I was gonna
help you out of a jam

1095
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,936
so you wouldn't have to go running
back to Mommy and Daddy again.

1096
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,572
- Please, tell me how you were gonna help me.
- How?

1097
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:19,574
- I would love that.
- How? I happen to have a friend

1098
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:21,442
who lives not too far
from here named FranÃ§ois.

1099
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,344
I snap my fucking fingers
and he'll show up here,

1100
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:26,346
- and he'll do whatever it takes to get you to LA.
- Oh.

1101
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,150
Pretty soon, you'll be in art
school all safe and sound,

1102
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,418
- while I'll be on the road fuckin' dying in a ditch.
- Good luck with that.

1103
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,621
I'm gonna take the bus.
Have fun.

1104
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,088
Joke's on you, asshole.

1105
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,490
There's no bus station
in this town.

1106
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,234
Fuck!

1107
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,567
Fine!

1108
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:50,036
Call Francis or whatever
the fuck his name is.

1109
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:51,271
His name's FranÃ§ois.

1110
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:52,639
I don't give a fuck.

1111
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:55,375
Okay, cool, I just...
I need your phone.

1112
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:56,476
What?

1113
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,045
I need your phone
to make the call.

1114
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,850
I don't have a phone.

1115
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,061
What's your code?

1116
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,061
Couple things about FranÃ§ois.

1117
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:17,331
- What?
- One,

1118
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,101
don't call him Francis or Frank

1119
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,501
or any shit
like that, okay?

1120
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,304
He doesn't like it.

1121
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,172
Number two,

1122
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,541
guy thinks he's some sort of fuckin'
hard-core badass or whatever.

1123
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:29,677
He's not.

1124
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,244
He's a fuckin' pussy,

1125
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,346
so don't listen to anything
he says, okay?

1126
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:35,516
Sounds just like you.

1127
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,119
You know, you're becoming
a real fuckin' asshole.

1128
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,590
Well, I'm learning
from the best.

1129
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,558
- Minivan?
- Yep.

1130
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,626
All right.

1131
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:51,168
So, just as soon
as I have you sign here...

1132
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,969
And here.
Yep.

1133
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:58,542
I can go ahead and take that
car off your hands for ya.

1134
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,212
All right.

1135
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:05,512
All right.

1136
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:07,516
Pleasure doing business with ya.

1137
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,427
Really need all that?

1138
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,262
I mean, I can't just
leave it all.

1139
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:23,431
Right?

1140
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,935
Whatever, man.

1141
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,509
Is that him?

1142
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,476
What the hell?

1143
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:41,282
Oh, I guess some things
just never change, huh?

1144
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,750
FranÃ§ois?

1145
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,420
It's good to see ya, man.

1146
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,958
- What are you wearing?
- Clothes.

1147
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,192
- Hey.
- Hi.

1148
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,460
- You must be Nat.
- Yes.

1149
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:53,594
Yeah.

1150
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,462
Heard a lot of
great stuff about you.

1151
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,398
Oh.
Good things, I hope.

1152
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,000
- Good things, yeah.
- Great.

1153
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,701
Um, by the way, thank you
so much for doing this.

1154
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,436
No, problemo.
<i>De nada.</i>

1155
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:06,139
- That's a nice camera. What is that?
- Uh, Pentax K1000.

1156
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:07,574
- K1000?
- Yeah.

1157
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:10,043
- Where'd you get that?
- Oh, my grandfather gave it to me.

1158
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,746
Whoa!
What the fuck, dude?

1159
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:13,581
Yeah. That's Jacqueline.
Watch your mouth, brother.

1160
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,516
Yeah, miracle of life.

1161
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,518
Pretty cool, right? Let's
get the party started here.

1162
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,221
Get your shit in the back.

1163
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,456
Since when do you
drive a Prius?

1164
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,791
Since the Earth
began to die.

1165
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:28,094
What happened to the GTO, man?

1166
01:04:28,096 --> 01:04:30,576
I get 45 miles per
gallon in the city in this thing.

1167
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,204
Buckle up, dude.

1168
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,773
What?

1169
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,478
There's a kid
in the car.

1170
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,067
So Richard, uh, you've
been unusually quiet.

1171
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,205
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1172
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,206
This guy basically taught me
everything I know.

1173
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,208
Literally, I wouldn't even be able to wipe
my own ass if it wasn't for this guy.

1174
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,411
You don't know how to wipe
your own ass, you dumb shit.

1175
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,413
Well, that is
kind of true.

1176
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,415
But seriously,
what happened?

1177
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,217
Hey, life goes on.
People change, man.

1178
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:26,122
You're looking at
the new me.

1179
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,527
Hey, Nat, will
you hand me my backpack?

1180
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:36,065
Uh, yeah, sure.

1181
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:51,311
What the fu... Hey,
have you seen my knife?

1182
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:53,279
Your knife?

1183
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:55,282
Yeah, my knife.

1184
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,750
My fuckin' dad
gave me that knife.

1185
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,219
It's the only thing I have from him.
It's not here.

1186
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:02,123
Um, no. No, no, no, no. I
haven't seen your knife.

1187
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,393
Your knife, no.

1188
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,293
That's weird.

1189
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,596
Yeah, weird.

1190
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:11,534
When's the last time
you were in Albuquerque, Richard?

1191
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,268
You're too good for us now.

1192
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,239
More like, Albuquerque's
too good for me.

1193
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:22,442
Hey man, again, I just wanna
say thank you so much for this.

1194
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:24,177
I really,
really appreciate it.

1195
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:26,246
Yeah. Hey, it's Richard
we're talking about, right?

1196
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,848
I can't tell you how many times
this guy's gotten me out of a jam.

1197
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:31,654
Uh...

1198
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,157
the sign says
straight for Albuquerque.

1199
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,927
- Huh?
- The sign back there, it said straight for Albuquerque.

1200
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,231
No.

1201
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,230
We're, uh,
taking a shortcut.

1202
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:45,632
We're gonna go around
the traffic.

1203
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:46,869
Oh. Okay.

1204
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,672
Everybody's got Chlamydia.

1205
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:55,342
- Fuckin' everybody's got Chlamydia.
- Yeah.

1206
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,344
I'm talking to FranÃ§ois
about it, and he goes...

1207
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,380
- Dude, I can't believe you're bringing this up.
- "My bad."

1208
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,215
- You remember that?
- Yeah. I do, I do.

1209
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,916
'Cause he was the one
who had it.

1210
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,219
He gave everybody
the same Chlamydia.

1211
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,454
Anybody else need to piss?

1212
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,790
Oh, man, we had some good
fuckin' times together, man.

1213
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,192
- Oh, shit, we sure did.
- Oh, shit.

1214
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,460
- Get out of the car.
- Holy shit. What are you doing?

1215
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:16,663
- Oh, fuck.
- Get out of the car. Get the fuck out of the car.

1216
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,433
- Go stand over there.
- Fuck me.

1217
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,634
How did I not
see this coming?

1218
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,639
You, give me your shit.

1219
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,674
- What?
- Your shit.

1220
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,942
I want your wallet, I want your phone,
and I want that sweet-ass camera.

1221
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,244
Put it on the seat
right now.

1222
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:33,279
Hey, <i>Ã¡ndale.</i>
Let's go.

1223
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:34,484
Come on.

1224
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:39,453
If you want my shit, you're
gonna have to come get it.

1225
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,422
What shit do you have?
You don't have any shit.

1226
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,922
That's not how friends
treat each other.

1227
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:45,358
I just told that great story
about how you gave me Chlamydia.

1228
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,826
That doesn't
make us friends.

1229
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:48,795
The only reason I'm here is
'cause you said

1230
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:51,264
you're with a little rich kid
with a wad of cash.

1231
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:53,833
Now look, you're not gonna say
anything about this to anybody

1232
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:59,273
because if you do, I'm gonna take a
little fuckin' visit to Enfield Lane,

1233
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,976
and I'm gonna curb-stomp
your fuckin' mom and dad.

1234
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:03,978
Shh. I know, honey.

1235
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,846
It's okay.

1236
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,349
I will kick your mother
the fuck over, dude.

1237
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:09,916
Is that what you want?

1238
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:12,518
So you go ahead,
you call the cops.

1239
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,290
I'll take it out in pain.

1240
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,326
Adios, motherfuckers.

1241
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:38,979
I am so sorry.

1242
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,951
- If I had any...
- I'm done.

1243
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,426
Hang on, Nat.

1244
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:56,266
This is my fault, like,
almost all of it.

1245
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,569
Where are you going?

1246
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:02,606
Nat, hang on.

1247
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,445
Yeah, that's right. You-You
lead the way, I'll follow you.

1248
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,448
Nat, I fucked up.

1249
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,783
Shut up, Richard.

1250
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,985
Okay. Good. You're
talking to me again?

1251
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,788
Oh, thank God. This has been the
longest three hours of my life.

1252
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,791
- Oh, my God.
- You know, if I had my knife,

1253
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,626
I totally could've stabbed
that asshole.

1254
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,594
I threw your knife
out the window!

1255
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:28,828
- What?
- Yeah.

1256
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:31,899
So fuck you
and fuck your knife.

1257
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,434
Oh. Well,
I guess we're even, now.

1258
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:34,935
- Richard.
- Huh?

1259
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,502
- Shut up.
- Oh.

1260
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:37,970
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:40,440
You got it.

1262
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,988
I think I figured
the whole Nina thing out.

1263
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,757
I think the mistake I made
was I-I came on too strong.

1264
01:09:57,759 --> 01:10:01,494
I just...
I fall in love too quick.

1265
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,816
You know, that's like...
that's my cross to bear.

1266
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,706
Hey.

1267
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,608
Hey, little guy.

1268
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,476
You still mad at me?

1269
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,513
Shut up.

1270
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,916
You hear that?

1271
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:23,920
Hey!

1272
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,054
Hey, hey!

1273
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,657
Hey!

1274
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:31,927
Huh.

1275
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,801
- Hi.
- Hey.

1276
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:43,770
Thank you so much
for stopping.

1277
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,073
What the heck
are you doing out here?

1278
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,741
Uh, it's a long story.

1279
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,710
Uh, do you mind
giving us a lift?

1280
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,112
Well, I'm going as far as Silver City.
You wanna go there?

1281
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,980
Uh, yeah, that'd be great.
Please.

1282
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:55,815
Okay, guys. Hop on in. Come on.

1283
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:57,587
Okay. Great.
Thank you.

1284
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:02,989
Here we go.

1285
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:05,859
I've been up in Gila
for the last few days.

1286
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,860
I volunteer
with the Park Service.

1287
01:11:07,862 --> 01:11:09,662
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

1288
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,131
- It is cool.
- It's cold. It's freezing.

1289
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,866
Here, take this sweatshirt.

1290
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,100
- Here, put it on.
- Are you sure?

1291
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:15,668
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

1292
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:16,972
Thank you.

1293
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,907
What's going on
with you guys?

1294
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:22,643
What're you doing out
on the road like that?

1295
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,479
- Uh, we just got robbed and were stranded up here.
- What?

1296
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,613
- What, you got robbed?
- Yeah.

1297
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:30,516
- Oh, my God.
- Friend of mine, who was supposed to be giving us a ride...

1298
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:31,984
- A friend!
- Well.

1299
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:35,055
Some friend.

1300
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,791
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.

1301
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,760
Well, you're
lucky it's January.

1302
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,662
It could've been worse.
The bears are all napping.

1303
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:45,966
God, I remember three
summers ago I was out here,

1304
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,469
was on an expedition
with a bunch of botanists.

1305
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:52,238
They were out collecting a bunch
of samples out in the field

1306
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,974
and I was back at camp.

1307
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,876
And I thought
I'd make some...

1308
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,010
some vegetable soup
for everybody.

1309
01:11:58,012 --> 01:12:02,216
So I was peeling potatoes
and I hear this...

1310
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,256
What's that?

1311
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,658
Yeah, that's what I thought.
"What's that?"

1312
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,961
And I look up,

1313
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:16,896
and there's
a little cub.

1314
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:19,198
And there's another
little cub.

1315
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,902
And behind the two
cubs is Mommy.

1316
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:22,970
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

1317
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:25,905
Yeah. And she was
not happy.

1318
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:28,975
And she was not asking me for soup.

1319
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,644
And I remembered, you know,
you're supposed to, like,

1320
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:33,881
get real full of
yourself, you know?

1321
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,184
You're supposed to, like, you know,
be big, try to be as big as they are.

1322
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,685
Well I'm 5'4", you know.
So that's not gonna happen.

1323
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:44,257
But I just got so full of
adrenaline and fear

1324
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,859
that I just
started yelling at her.

1325
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:51,064
And I said, "Get the fuck out of
my campground, you crazy bitch!"

1326
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:55,601
And... And I started
throwing my potatoes at her.

1327
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:57,703
And I startled her.
She just...

1328
01:12:57,705 --> 01:13:00,140
I didn't know what was gonna
happen, and all of a sudden...

1329
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,208
Oh, thank you Jesus...
she ran!

1330
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,810
She ran.
Her cubs ran.

1331
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:07,948
And I just kept throwing. I was just
picking up carrots and potatoes

1332
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,317
and everything,
and I just went crazy.

1333
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,653
And... And then
they were gone.

1334
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,555
- And...
- That's amazing.

1335
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,024
And it was...

1336
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,859
It was such a great
feeling, you know?

1337
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,260
It was like... It was like...
It was like, you know...

1338
01:13:21,262 --> 01:13:23,997
Those times when you just feel
like a penny waiting for a change

1339
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,699
and then all of a sudden,
the cash box is full.

1340
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:29,569
Yeah.
It was all right.

1341
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:33,105
You know, those botanists came
back and I-I told them that story.

1342
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,743
Well, somebody else was Big
Man On Campus that night.

1343
01:13:37,745 --> 01:13:41,047
I can tell you that.
That was the truth, yeah.

1344
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,984
- Yeah.
- Somewhere that bear's telling the story

1345
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:48,725
- about the crazy lady with vegetables.
- Yeah.

1346
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:16,917
Hey, Nat?

1347
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,086
Nat.
Wake up, buddy.

1348
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,720
Okay.

1349
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:24,992
I think you should report
what happened to the police.

1350
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,127
- Um...
- Okay?

1351
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,761
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1352
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:30,831
- Um, thank you very much.
- You bet.

1353
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,666
- For everything. Really.
- You bet. No problem.

1354
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,835
Hey.
Hold on a second.

1355
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,339
Hold on a second.

1356
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,811
You guys need this
more than I do.

1357
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:50,050
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1358
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,784
- Really, thank you.
- It's okay. Yeah.

1359
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:54,988
You just... You go on in there
and just tell 'em everything,

1360
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,355
and they'll
take care of ya.

1361
01:14:56,357 --> 01:14:58,091
I've known these guys
for years. They're great.

1362
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,393
- Okay, cool. Thank you.
- Okay.

1363
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,994
Hey, Richard? Good
luck to ya, buddy.

1364
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,199
Thanks for everything,
Dotty.

1365
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,245
Well...
I guess this is it.

1366
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,886
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

1367
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:28,123
Wait. What?

1368
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:38,200
This is seriously, like,
the best food I've ever eaten.

1369
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,134
You've changed, man.

1370
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,436
You're no longer like the baby Nat
that I met a couple days ago.

1371
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,372
You're like,
real hard-core now.

1372
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:49,975
- Being held at gunpoint will do that to you.
- It's true.

1373
01:15:49,977 --> 01:15:52,378
Hey, so when you
go to the cops,

1374
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,913
probably gonna
hang out here.

1375
01:15:53,915 --> 01:15:55,881
Me and the police, we don't
really mix very well.

1376
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:59,388
I'm not going to the station.
Hitching a ride to Albuquerque.

1377
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,322
To Albuquerque?

1378
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,957
FranÃ§ois.

1379
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,393
- You ready to see how it's done?
- By all means, please.

1380
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,260
- You ready to see the master in action?
- I would love to.

1381
01:16:08,262 --> 01:16:09,962
Show me how it's done please, bud.

1382
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:11,131
Here we go.

1383
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,433
We're about to go
to Albuquerque.

1384
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:15,868
Ten bucks says
I get the first car.

1385
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,203
- You guys need a ride?
- Yeah.

1386
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,171
- Yeah, we would love one.
- Yeah, come on. Why?

1387
01:16:19,173 --> 01:16:21,006
Yeah, are you
going to Albuquerque?

1388
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:22,842
Real sorry, dude. She's freakin' out.
I don't know.

1389
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,877
Fuck you!

1390
01:16:24,879 --> 01:16:26,246
That was weird.

1391
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,482
Fuck, man.

1392
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:30,449
Ah, actually that
happens to me all the time.

1393
01:16:30,451 --> 01:16:32,452
- Really?
- Yeah.

1394
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,087
You get out here and try it. Maybe your
pretty face will change the equation.

1395
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:37,056
Sure. Should I...
So it's blowin' on the thumb?

1396
01:16:37,058 --> 01:16:39,926
- Oh, just get out there, you little shit.
- That's... Just blow on it?

1397
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,060
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1398
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:42,394
- Shut up.
- Do I shake it?

1399
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:44,396
- Do I go rad?
- You know what? Don't get cocky, okay?

1400
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:46,800
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey.

1401
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:47,967
- I think I got one.
- What?

1402
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:49,502
- No!
- Yes!

1403
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:52,372
Are you kidding?

1404
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,073
- Amazing!
- That's not how it works.

1405
01:16:54,075 --> 01:16:55,876
I want you to know that.

1406
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,244
- You just got lucky. That's beginner's luck.
- No.

1407
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,146
Hi. Uh, we're headed
towards Albuquerque.

1408
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,181
- Do you mind if you take us?
- Get in the back.

1409
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:04,486
- Get in the back.
- I got the car.

1410
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,861
Right up here is fine.

1411
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,863
- Thank you so much, Gary.
- All right, man.

1412
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,802
- Good luck with getting your kids back.
- Thank you very much.

1413
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,304
Okay, listen.

1414
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,206
I don't know what you think
you're doing, okay,

1415
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:29,842
but this isn't your exact world,
okay, crime and so forth.

1416
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:32,845
So you don't just go barging into some
guy's house who robbed you at gunpoint.

1417
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:34,046
- I think that's the car.
- Wait. No.

1418
01:17:34,048 --> 01:17:35,582
It may be,
but it doesn't matter.

1419
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,317
Are you listening to me?

1420
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,152
You... Nat.

1421
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,987
- Nat!
- Shut up, Richard. Come on.

1422
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,989
- You can't sneak around in the middle of broad daylight.
- Shh!

1423
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:45,926
Walk like a normal person.

1424
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:48,127
You look ridi...
Oh, my God.

1425
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,431
You're gonna
get us arrested.

1426
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,107
My wallet and stuff
are in the back.

1427
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:01,440
Shit.
It's locked.

1428
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:04,043
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no!

1429
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,548
Come back.
No, don't.

1430
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:14,153
- God! Fuck!
- Shh!

1431
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:16,989
Goddamn it. That cactus got
me right in the fuckin' dick.

1432
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:19,359
- His keys are right by the front door.
- God. Fuck.

1433
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,927
God.

1434
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:24,197
- Door's locked.
- Okay. Well, we tried. Let's go.

1435
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,497
Yeah. Let's go
through the back.

1436
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:27,500
No. We're not
going through the back.

1437
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,635
You don't go in the back door
of someone's house

1438
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:33,974
who you know has a gun,
and is also inside the house.

1439
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:37,943
You are doing this wrong. It's not like
the back door is gonna be open anyway.

1440
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:38,945
Oh, goddamn it!

1441
01:19:15,049 --> 01:19:19,051
<i>When Turner gives
the order, cease fire.</i>

1442
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:20,953
I'm gonna get his keys.
Cover me. Okay?

1443
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,225
Okay.

1444
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,625
<i>You wait for a sign.</i>

1445
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,254
Go.

1446
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,963
Mommy.

1447
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,720
- Hang on.
- What?

1448
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:29,025
I'm gonna take a shit
on this guy's front step.

1449
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,395
No one fucks
with my friends.

1450
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:36,195
Hurry up.

1451
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:38,030
- Richard.
- Oh!

1452
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:39,399
Taking a shit
on my steps?

1453
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,467
Monica, get the gun.

1454
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,135
Oh, God.

1455
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:45,505
You little bitch-ass
piece of shit!

1456
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,007
- FranÃ§ois, I can't hear you.
- I said, get the gun!

1457
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,710
Don't yell. You'll wake up the ba...
Oh, you woke the baby.

1458
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,746
- So, feed her!
- Father of the Fuckin' Year.

1459
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:55,015
- Is that Richard?
- Hi, Monica.

1460
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,149
Cool, guys.
Awesome.

1461
01:21:01,222 --> 01:21:03,023
You think you're so hard,
don't you?

1462
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,460
You don't know hard.

1463
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,793
You pussy little bitch.

1464
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:09,295
- Richard!
- Piece of shit.

1465
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,363
You don't know.

1466
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:13,632
You're a fuckin' joke,
Richard.

1467
01:21:13,634 --> 01:21:16,304
You always have been.
And you always will be.

1468
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,077
Come on.

1469
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,444
I'll drive.

1470
01:21:25,446 --> 01:21:26,645
- What?
- I'll drive!

1471
01:21:26,647 --> 01:21:27,717
Okay.

1472
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,755
He's not getting up.

1473
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,223
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.

1474
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,195
It's a fuckin' Prius,
dickhead.

1475
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:44,764
Thank you, man. Thank you for
helping me out. That was huge.

1476
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,367
- Do you think I hurt him?
- Fuck, yeah, you hurt him. Are you kidding?

1477
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,101
- You probably fuckin' killed him.
- What?

1478
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:51,136
I'm kidding with you.
Dude, I'm fucking with you.

1479
01:21:51,138 --> 01:21:52,805
- You definitely did not kill him.
- Okay.

1480
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,808
At best, he's gonna need
some stitches, okay.

1481
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:58,411
Which he fucking deserves
for coming at us like that.

1482
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,280
Whoo! Classic FranÃ§ois, though.

1483
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:04,283
I'm glad to know
he's still in the game.

1484
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:06,286
Geez.

1485
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,619
Look good?

1486
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:08,854
- It's great.
- Okay, good.

1487
01:22:08,856 --> 01:22:10,422
- It's good, it's good.
- All right.

1488
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:12,625
- Oh.
- Fuck, yeah. We did it, man.

1489
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,627
- We fuckin' did it.
- Oh, my God, your head's bleeding.

1490
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,296
- Are you okay?
- What?

1491
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:18,297
Oh, look at that.
Yeah.

1492
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:20,867
Oh, he fuckin' got me.

1493
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,368
You know what though?
I got to respect it.

1494
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,404
He had to come at me.

1495
01:22:25,406 --> 01:22:26,738
Makes sense.

1496
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:29,442
I mean, it's crazy.

1497
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,778
- It's crazy.
- Nah. You know, it's not crazy.

1498
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,646
- It's FranÃ§ois.
- I hit him.

1499
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:36,616
Dude, did you see when I did it?
I hit him...

1500
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,219
- Oh, yeah. It was fuckin' badass, dude.
- Oh, my God. That's amazing.

1501
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,688
- I've never done anything like that before in my life.
- That was fuckin' badass moves.

1502
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,159
- I love that.
- Jesus Christ.

1503
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,632
- What's happening?
- What's happening is you're getting out.

1504
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:55,170
- Let's go.
- What?

1505
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:58,137
Okay. Come on.

1506
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,538
We're driving a stolen car.

1507
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,908
You just assaulted somebody.
We gotta get you outta here.

1508
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,643
What about you?

1509
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,278
What about me?
Who cares?

1510
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,749
Just take your stuff and go.

1511
01:23:14,655 --> 01:23:16,622
That's it?
That's all you're taking?

1512
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,458
Yeah. All this shit
doesn't seem important anymore.

1513
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,827
You're welcome to keep whatever you
want and throw away whatever you don't.

1514
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:23,598
All right.
Whatever.

1515
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,768
This is our third time
saying good-bye.

1516
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,290
Yeah, well, you know what they say.
Third time's a charm, right?

1517
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,246
All right.
Oh, okay.

1518
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:40,988
You take care of yourself, Nat.
Okay?

1519
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,850
You too, Richard.

1520
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,385
You're a good kid.

1521
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:47,319
Thanks, man.

1522
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,720
Keep that dick dry.

1523
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:50,256
Yep.

1524
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,794
You too, bud.

1525
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,966
Hey, Nat.

1526
01:24:00,968 --> 01:24:02,635
Eat shit.

1527
