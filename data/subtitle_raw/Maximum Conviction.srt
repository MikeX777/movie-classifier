1
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,353
( camera shutter clicking )

2
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,534
( helicopter blades whirring )

3
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,159
( gate buzzes )

4
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,868
( police radio chatter )

5
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,648
( guards conversing )

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,527
( gate buzzes )

7
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,504
Last day.

8
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,039
So it is.

9
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,804
Sorry, boys,
there's been a delay.

10
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,808
Where the fuck's Bradley?

11
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,935
He's taking care of shit
at the airport.

12
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,446
We've got a flight
to Mexico City to catch.

13
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,311
Negative.
We've got a delay.

14
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,715
Why don't you guys
hole up in town for a little bit?

15
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,309
There's a nice little bar there.

16
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,877
We'll meet you at 1800 hours.

17
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,980
Got it. l'll tell Bradley
to meet us there.

18
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,615
Until then.

19
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,853
( both chuckle )

20
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,415
- ( distant prisoners shouting )
- ( gate buzzes )

21
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,812
Mm, Fields.

22
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,386
Here you go.

23
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,361
Nice.

24
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,227
Hell, something
smells good there.

25
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,165
Mm-hmm.

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,667
The woman sure can cook.

27
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,225
You got yourself
a lady in the kitchen?

28
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,465
Maybe.

29
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,735
Well, the way you're eating
that burrito,

30
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,298
you should marry her.

31
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,003
- ( laughs )
- Why not?

32
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,511
Nobody cooks
that good, man.

33
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,378
Yeah, but you'd have someone to go
home to every night. Think about it.

34
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,905
l'd just get bored.

35
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,646
Yeah, well, being bored,
that's the secret,

36
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,917
l think-- bored,
but being happy, like me.

37
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,253
You're happy?

38
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,521
Yeah. Don't l look happy?

39
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,254
An exciting life

40
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,058
is a good way
to get yourself killed.

41
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,064
Remember that.

42
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,228
- You heard?
- All right. Hey, you want one?

43
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,828
No way.

44
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,882
( knocks )

45
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,277
( lock beeps,
door opens )

46
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,444
How are you doing?

47
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,703
Man: Open it up.

48
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,042
( guards conversing )

49
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,646
HSO team just rolled in.

50
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,621
l said we'd meet them in 10,
at 1800.

51
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,783
Yeah, but oddly enough,
transport still hasn't shown up.

52
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,622
We're waiting
on the marshals again.

53
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,594
We're waiting on
the fucking bus?

54
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,618
Guess so.

55
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,460
God damn it.

56
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,728
l still can't believe l let you
convince me to come here

57
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,792
to shut down
a couple of bullshit buildings.

58
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,997
l usually make
the mess, brother.

59
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,869
You got me
cleaning this one up.

60
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,636
See, the thing of it is,
you're getting old, man.

61
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,937
l got to let you down easy.

62
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,343
But the thing of it is, when l want
somebody to cover my back,

63
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,870
you're my man.

64
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,712
All our guys--
they're the best.

65
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,117
The way l look at it, you'll be
down in Mexico in the next few days

66
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,713
and there's 4,000 ways
to get killed down there,

67
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,485
so watch your ass.

68
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,458
Thanks for trying
to cheer me up.

69
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,586
( laughs )

70
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,391
Last time was a real
clusterfuck, wasn't it?

71
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,864
- Lost some damn good men.
- Yeah.

72
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,561
Army brass should have never
pulled us out of that shithole.

73
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,365
Man, why do you act
so surprised?

74
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,100
That's the way all these highfalutin
military pricks is, man.

75
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,801
- You know that.
- ( gate buzzes )

76
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,208
We're the first guys
that they piss on.

77
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,907
Anyway, next week
you'll get some payback, man.

78
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,438
And speaking of pricks...

79
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,919
Every time l get another stack
of bullshit paperwork,

80
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,944
your fingerprints
are all over it, Cross.

81
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,684
Yeah, l thought your job
was bullshit paperwork.

82
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,316
- Shut up.
- Negative, Warden.

83
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,849
l ain't got to shut up.

84
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,759
Go hide behind your desk.
We're done here.

85
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,787
- No, you're not.
- We kind of are, man,

86
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,629
'cause this bitch
is fully decommissioned.

87
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,635
l took us off the grid, man--

88
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,797
computers, satellites, phones--
everything.

89
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,808
Transport will be here soon
to get the detainees.

90
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,866
We're done.

91
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,242
No, you booked in two more
high-security assets last night.

92
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,906
You reopened block D

93
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,245
right after you and Manning
permanently shut it down.

94
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,843
See, you have to
understand something--

95
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,320
this is a black site,

96
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,017
specifically designed
for people of interest.

97
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,617
No, no, no, it was a black site,
Cross-- was.

98
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,322
You security contractors--
you're all the same.

99
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,731
You think you're hot shit ex-soldiers,
big fucking heroes.

100
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,598
Well, you're a pain in my ass.

101
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,934
We already had four people
of special interest here.

102
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,132
We don't have enough MPs
to legally hold

103
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,902
all the fucking interesting
people we got,

104
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,103
let alone the two
who came in last night.

105
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,772
When you signed those two in last
night, you took authority over them.

106
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,611
That means signing them out
will be your job, not mine.

107
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,641
l would enjoy the process.

108
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,882
Well, the transfer unit's late,
so you're going nowhere

109
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,016
till all the detainees have cleared
the gate on the way out.

110
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,030
( gate buzzes )

111
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,175
( prisoners shouting )

112
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,655
Step away from the bars.

113
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,852
Detainees, step back.

114
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,884
Let me out!

115
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,526
Detainees, step back.

116
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,162
( man screams )

117
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,570
What the fuck?

118
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,574
Fucking liars!

119
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,008
l'm gonna fucking kill you guys!

120
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,841
l'll fucking kill you all!

121
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,943
Chow. Bring him in.

122
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,148
Fuck you.
l'm not eating that shit.

123
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,952
Don't ever touch me.

124
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,828
Code red.
Backup in the courtyard.

125
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,922
Repeat, backup in the courtyard!
Code red.

126
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,956
Fucking killers!

127
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,475
( man shouting )

128
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,311
Open the courtyard gate.

129
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,247
Open the courtyard.

130
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,279
( gate buzzes )

131
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,460
What's the problem, man?
What's the problem?

132
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,095
lnmate: Come on, man.
Want something?

133
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,962
( grunting )

134
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,861
Boss. Okay, boss.

135
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,035
- You all right?
- Fuck you.

136
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,477
Sir, l found this kite
in the corridor.

137
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,743
l don't know if the inmates
are trying to communicate,

138
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,272
but l thought
you should know.

139
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,546
All right.

140
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,280
Be cool.

141
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,422
l'ma get you.
Fuck you. l'ma get you.

142
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,661
Let me see that.

143
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,641
( gate buzzes )

144
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,142
Whoa.

145
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,047
The name on the manifest
says Rick.

146
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,483
The name tag says Max.
You want to explain that?

147
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,647
The truck rolled
over his foot yesterday.

148
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,022
Um, l usually work dispatch.

149
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,186
Short-staffed, so...

150
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,287
Almost wrapped up here,
so let's get it done.

151
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,993
Sorry, you know, l was trying
to sneak in a bit of overtime.

152
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,969
Wife's birthday,
you know, coming up.

153
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,028
Why don't we catch up
some other time, all right?

154
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,303
Just get on with your job
so l can get the fuck out of here.

155
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,276
Manning:
Sanders, guard the fort.

156
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,388
( machine whirring )

157
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,160
( metal squeaking )

158
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,032
( metallic rattling )

159
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,196
- Don't tell me you fucked this up.
- l don't know.

160
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,967
All you had to do
was push a goddamn button.

161
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,167
Sounds like
something snapped.

162
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,335
Something snapped?
ls that your professional opinion

163
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,470
or just a wild fucking guess?

164
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,184
Shit, l'm gonna die of old age
in this motherfucker.

165
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,709
Get the truck, pull it out.
We need to take a look.

166
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,654
Pull it out.

167
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,693
( engine starts )

168
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,659
Kill it. Kill it.

169
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,264
- ( engine stops )
- l'm smelling diesel out here.

170
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,241
The truck won't disengage.

171
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,335
Something's definitely stuck
back there.

172
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,869
You might want to call your buddies to
come down here and give you some help.

173
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,075
( chuckles )
Yeah, good luck with that.

174
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,210
Friday night-- everyone's
packed out till Monday.

175
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,447
Manning: Shit.

176
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,490
l got it.

177
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,888
l'll see what l can do.

178
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,489
( gate buzzes, lock clicks )

179
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,234
Hey, bud, it's Manning.

180
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,501
Hey, listen, we've got an issue
with the garbage truck.

181
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,976
Something's jammed in there
and l'm smelling diesel fumes.

182
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,535
Well, you know, block D
is on the same ventilation system

183
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,944
as maintenance.

184
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,848
Yes, sir, same place you booked in
two assets last night.

185
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,943
Fuck. l'm gonna head
down there right now.

186
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,648
Anyway, l'll take care of it.

187
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,157
l don't think either of us
is gonna make it out of here tonight.

188
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,488
Wonderful.

189
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,702
l was about to contact you
on the radio, sir.

190
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,762
l'm smelling diesel
down here.

191
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,366
Yeah, l know. l'm moving
the detainees as we speak.

192
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,571
- Where are we gonna put them?
- Unfortunately, block G.

193
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,238
Seriously?

194
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,215
Those fucking guys are gonna go crazy
when they know about them.

195
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,149
Unfortunately, l don't have
much of a choice.

196
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,050
You know, it's only
for a couple of hours.

197
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,952
Everybody's transferring
out tonight.

198
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,980
So let's just do it.

199
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,355
All right, girls,
let's go for a walk.

200
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,331
Let's see your hands, girls.

201
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,533
Woman:
Please listen to me.

202
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,407
l'm a foreign national.

203
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,435
My government
has no idea where l am.

204
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,244
Cross: Right.
And you're a political prisoner.

205
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,250
l know.
l've heard that before, man.

206
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,082
Every motherfucker in here
that's wrapped in skin

207
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,554
is a political prisoner.

208
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,057
l'm no idiot, okay?
l know what this place is

209
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,355
and l know where
guys like you come from.

210
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,862
lf you don't help me,
then l'm dead.

211
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,830
Went in the boiler room,
grabbed some tools.

212
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,062
l went ahead and shut the heat down
to G block while l was there, FYl.

213
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,831
Sure got some ugly janitors
in this dump.

214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,431
- Who let the hooker in?
- Fuck you.

215
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,997
l did.

216
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,669
You deal with your mess.

217
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,376
l've got a garbage truck with my name
on it waiting for me.

218
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,146
Call me.

219
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,176
lt was ClA this time.

220
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,744
Please listen to me.

221
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,654
Look, l'm a courier.

222
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,920
My contact was
assassinated right in--

223
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,086
Cross:
ln private.

224
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,459
Woman:
This time it was ClA.

225
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,691
- ( men jeering )
- Look, l'm not bullshitting you.

226
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,893
l'm trying to tell you
that if you don't listen to me,

227
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,061
if you don't help me,
then l'm dead. l'm--

228
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,038
Cross: You just gotta stop talking
in front of people.

229
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,102
Manning: Please tell me you know
what the hell you're doing in there.

230
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,043
Cross:
What's your ETA, man?

231
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,484
lt's gonna be a while.

232
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,044
The prisoners are locked
and secured in block G.

233
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,853
l'm meeting the team.
l've got something to run by Bradley.

234
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,226
Radio me if the transfer unit
shows up.

235
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,251
Will do.

236
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,226
Well, fuck me.

237
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,871
Man, we ain't never getting out
of here at this rate.

238
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,239
l'll take a look.

239
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,036
Man over radio: Target in place.
Commence extraction.

240
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,672
( blues music playing )

241
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,552
Man: Come on, boss,
have a drink.

242
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,352
These ladies have been waiting
for you and Manning all day.

243
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,387
Oh, thank you.

244
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,489
Cross: Where the hell is Bradley?
l gotta get back to the base.

245
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,636
Bradley: Hey, sorry l'm late.

246
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,968
So where's Manning?

247
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,598
l thought he was
coming with you.

248
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,201
He's fucking around with that
trash compressor or some shit.

249
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,711
And he's happy about it too.

250
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,247
So l heard you might have
something for me.

251
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,445
l've got a kite

252
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,717
that they seem to have recovered
from one of the inmates,

253
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,317
but l got a funny feeling that this
looks like numeric and Arabic mixed.

254
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,884
And Arabic is your deal,

255
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,454
so have a look at that
and l'll come down in a minute.

256
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,626
Yeah, that's exactly
what it is.

257
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,967
As you know,
ciphers are numeric-based,

258
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,995
but the Arabic is unusual.

259
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,338
Fortunately, it's one of
my specialties.

260
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,652
Hey, the wagon
finally arrived.

261
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,948
Looks like we're out of here
in the morning.

262
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,534
Control unit to Manning:
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

263
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,603
Control unit to Manning,
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

264
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,440
Man: Manning is still working
on the crusher.

265
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,537
l'll let him know
when he comes out.

266
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,343
Guard:
Let's get Terrence on it.

267
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,374
Terrence, this is Control.
We need you in intake.

268
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,181
The transfer unit
is here. Copy?

269
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,380
Terrence:
On my way.

270
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,980
Wait here.

271
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,034
( blues music playing )

272
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,617
lt's complicated,
but my best guess is

273
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,315
that a dirty guard
has been passing on information.

274
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,448
That's basically an itinerary.

275
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,824
lt gives the exact pickup time
and the route the marshals are going to.

276
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,056
Okay, so what
we're talking about

277
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,894
is a high-risk extraction
in the making,

278
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,627
and it's coming soon.

279
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,260
We have little time.
Where is your gear?

280
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,500
The gear's still at the airport.
l didn't think we'd need it.

281
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,769
Well, always gotta be ready,
right?

282
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,608
Listen, l'm gonna go brief Manning
and jump up ahead of you guys.

283
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,636
You guys go tack up.
Meet me there.

284
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,740
Go in the tunnels
off the motor pool

285
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,274
and nobody will see you.

286
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,980
Keep your eyes open,
your head on a swivel.

287
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,749
Okay.

288
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,780
All right, gentlemen,

289
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,088
we got a fucking shit sandwich
coming on real fast.

290
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,253
We need to tack up now.

291
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,024
- Let's go.
- All right.

292
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,864
## Happy days are here... ##

293
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,892
All right,
let's see what you got.

294
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,426
l don't think you can handle
what l got.

295
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,961
Come on, bring it.

296
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,837
Oh, damn!

297
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,638
Now, see, that was pure luck.
A pro would never take that shot.

298
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,976
Captain Christopher Blake,
US marshal, prisoner transfer unit.

299
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,879
You got two female
detainees for me.

300
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,476
Man over P.A.:
Personnel, be advised,

301
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,146
please remember
to catalogue all boxes

302
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,385
according to the official
government itemized checklist.

303
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,618
How's your Friday night?

304
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,190
Yeah, this all seems in order,

305
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,702
but there's only transfer papers
for two prisoners.

306
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,900
That's what it says-- Samantha Mendez
and Charlotte Walker.

307
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,134
Problem?

308
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,971
l heard you were supposed
to move all six.

309
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,273
That's news to me.

310
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,915
Well, l can't authorize
this anyway.

311
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,884
You're gonna have to talk
to the warden.

312
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,011
Take Marshal Blake
to see the warden.

313
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,454
l'm gonna call Esmeralda,
see if she can stay late in the kitchen

314
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,822
and get you boys fed.

315
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,486
You two stay here.
You're with me.

316
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,699
Clear.

317
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,949
l've been through that thing
from top to bottom.

318
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,979
Nothing's wrong
with the crusher.

319
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,288
Gotta be the goddamn truck.

320
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,658
Fire that son of a bitch
back up.

321
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,761
- ( knocks on door )
- What?

322
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,739
l said what?
ls everybody deaf around here?

323
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,641
Warden, Captain Christopher Blake,

324
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,736
US Marshal,
Prisoner Transfer Unit.

325
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,680
You have two female detainees
for me to pick up.

326
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,247
Well, l sympathize
with your predicament, Marshal,

327
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,619
but it seems that nobody has
any concern for mine.

328
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,523
l got a schedule to keep.
You got the documentation.

329
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,083
l'm not asking you
for any favors.

330
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,291
The detainees are going
from a military to a federal facility.

331
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,960
Your paperwork requires
the correct signature.

332
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,969
lt doesn't happen to be mine.

333
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,233
We can fix the paperwork.
Warden,

334
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,832
l'm working in cooperation
with the ClA.

335
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,844
They have a special interest
in these two detainees.

336
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,436
- Bring it.
- Want some of this? Huh? Huh?

337
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,071
- l don't think you do.
- Come on.

338
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,309
- Oh!
- Oh. See?

339
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,511
- Want a coffee, loser?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,453
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey, two sugars this time.

341
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,648
Sure.

342
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,691
## You lift me up
and carry me away... ##

343
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,894
Put in manual access,
back in a minute.

344
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,995
( gate opens )

345
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,597
- Cross: D-486, anybody.
- ( punches landing, men grunting )

346
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,608
This is headquarters.

347
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,133
D-486, anybody.

348
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,168
This is headquarters.

349
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,443
This is MP Terrence Davis, sir.

350
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,575
What's your status?

351
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,484
Davis: The transfer unit just arrived.
They're talking to the warden.

352
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,614
They only had the paperwork
to transfer two detainees.

353
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,148
Where's Manning?

354
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,320
Davis: Still dealing
with the garbage issue, sir.

355
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,763
All right, look, man, nobody moves.
Wait till l get there.

356
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,166
Do not release the Pls.
Do not release the prisoners.

357
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,193
Nobody moves
till l get there.

358
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,637
Davis: Copy that, sir.

359
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,610
Sounds like a vibrator
my wife used to have.

360
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,044
Keep rigging it.

361
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,148
Something's gonna snap.

362
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,414
No fucking shit.
That's the idea.

363
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,512
l want to break
whatever's in there.

364
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,319
l'm not staying in this
son of a bitch all night.

365
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,691
ClA can shove their gratitude
up their ass.

366
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,928
Cross signed them in
on his authority.

367
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,992
You need his signature
to get them out.

368
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,867
l'm not here
to make your life easier.

369
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,373
Boy, you got that right.

370
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,007
So where the fuck are they?

371
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,676
( song continues on radio )

372
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,278
( humming along )

373
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,482
Hey.

374
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,686
Put the coffees down.

375
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,026
Sit in the chair and open
the doors l tell you to open

376
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,896
when l tell you to open them,
and nobody gets hurt.

377
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,562
Fuck you.

378
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,366
What? Wait, no.

379
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,168
( gunshot )

380
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,216
Begin phase two.

381
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,741
That's our signal.
On your feet.

382
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,277
Light it up.

383
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,753
( chuckles )
lt's working again.

384
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,525
Ready to charge now.
Everyone stand back.

385
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,628
Charge, one minute.

386
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,574
What's that noise?

387
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,466
Time to charge.

388
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,977
Ready?

389
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,479
Fire in the hole.

390
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,980
Fuck.

391
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,313
Password, password, password.

392
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,341
What the fuck is the password?

393
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,988
lt's inside the crusher.

394
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,259
- Man: Clear the blast zone.
- Clear!

395
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,426
Get down.

396
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,711
This is Terrence, sir.

397
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,112
l don't know about Manning,
but l just heard an explosion.

398
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,309
( siren wailing )

399
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,654
Secured?

400
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,223
lf the MP and the security guard
are dead,

401
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,394
then, yeah, we're secured.

402
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,131
Good.

403
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,447
Driver: Easy payday.
Why don't we get the girl?

404
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,353
Where are they?

405
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,361
l don't know what you're
talking about.

406
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,226
Who the fuck do you think
l'm talking about?

407
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,289
The two that were
brought in here last night.

408
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,733
Oh, yes. l can tell you.
They're in-- they're in--

409
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,259
Where are they,
God damn it?

410
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,033
Cross reopened block D.

411
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,063
Block D.

412
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,269
Light up cell block D.

413
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,676
l want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

414
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,111
Copy.

415
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,980
lt's that way.

416
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,888
Control, can you see us?

417
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,457
l see you. Hold.

418
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,431
What's the problem?

419
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,701
l don't know, man. He must have
put it on manual when l came in.

420
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,730
l need the fucking password.

421
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,104
l need your password
to open doors.

422
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,704
l don't have a password.

423
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,045
Then l'm gonna find
someone who does.

424
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,415
Please, no.
Control room-- in the control room,

425
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,784
there's a fingerprint scanner
on the board.

426
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,949
lt gives me access to all
the sensitive systems in an emergency.

427
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,424
Warden:
What are you gonna do?

428
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,588
Move, God damn it.
What finger?

429
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,461
Warden: No.

430
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,966
- Which finger?
- No!

431
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,437
( screams )

432
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,472
This finger?

433
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,070
My finger--
you cut my finger off. Fuck.

434
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,276
- Do l need to cut off another one?
- Please, please.

435
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,810
l can take you there.

436
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,982
There's 50 keys here.

437
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,958
l know which ones to use.

438
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,722
Let me show you.
lt'll be faster.

439
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,956
Please don't kill me.

440
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,192
Please.

441
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,828
Suit yourself.

442
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,838
Blake over radio:
Control, l'm on my way.

443
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,669
l've got access to the board.

444
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,177
- Let's go.
- Okay.

445
00:31:59,183 --> 00:31:59,284
This one MP,

446
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,718
This one MP,

447
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,721
the security guy-- Manning--

448
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,724
looked like ex-special ops,

449
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,919
a big, bald asshole.

450
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,428
No offense.

451
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,453
Just find them.

452
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,693
Confirm that they're dead.

453
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,065
( siren continues wailing )

454
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,299
Here's one of them.

455
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,643
- That's him! Waste him!
- ( rapid gunfire )

456
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,520
Secure the area.

457
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,717
Max, with me.

458
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,170
One more idiot play like that
and l'll blow your head off myself.

459
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,455
( steam hissing )

460
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,444
( door slams )

461
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,064
( rapid gunfire )

462
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,722
( bones crack )

463
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,267
( rapid gunfire )

464
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,482
( door slams )

465
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,519
The main gate
to the holding area is secure.

466
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,258
Who are you?

467
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,130
Special Agent Watkins.
l have an appointment with the warden

468
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,260
about some kind of
narcotics activity here.

469
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,532
We're doing a high-risk
security transfer here.

470
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,061
We're gonna have to
ask you to leave.

471
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,631
All right.

472
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,659
Fields over radio: Team two.
Respond, team two.

473
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,070
All right, head up, Bradley.
We've got active hostiles up in here.

474
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,869
Bradley: 10-4. En route.

475
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,706
Fields: Team two, respond.

476
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,735
( two gunshots )

477
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,984
Fields over radio:
We have another issue.

478
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,254
How many parts of your job
have you managed to fuck up today?

479
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,022
Not me.

480
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,996
Team two
has been compromised.

481
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,998
What's the damage?

482
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,262
Terminated.

483
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,701
Got some guy coming in through
prisoner intake, came out of nowhere.

484
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,728
Whoa, whoa.

485
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,240
Fields: He's changed into full tactical.
This guy means business.

486
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,470
Shit. Let's go.

487
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,011
Control, we got a security expert
on the loose--

488
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,043
Manning-- conversant
in special ops.

489
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,113
He went through the south boiler.
Can you track him?

490
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,714
Fields: Don't see him.
He must be off the grid.

491
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,658
l need access now,
or l'm gonna start blowing doors.

492
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,354
And track Manning.
He's bad news.

493
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,386
Blake: Stand down, Collins.
That's an order.

494
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,490
Your priority is the target
in cell block D.

495
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,899
Fields, do you have a visual?

496
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,867
Nothing but empty cell blocks.

497
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,000
Blake: What about
the rest of the prison?

498
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,943
Nothing.
We have two internal MPs

499
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,536
in the ultra max sector,
no threat.

500
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,343
No visual on the target.

501
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,317
Blake: Find her.

502
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,649
- lt's this way.
- Let's go.

503
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,095
Yo, the guy from the cell blocks
is moving.

504
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,765
Blake: Track him.

505
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,707
Let me know if he stumbles
into our kill zone.

506
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,677
We'll isolate and extract him
after we've secured the target.

507
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,974
You understand?

508
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,207
Fields: Copy.

509
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,783
( engine revs )

510
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,422
( tires screech )

511
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,200
Cross's last radio transmit said
there were active hostiles.

512
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,041
At this stage, we have to assume
it's an extraction.

513
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,674
We've got minimal gear and ammo,
so we go in quiet

514
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,581
through the old
hydro-access tunnels.

515
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,381
We make every shot count.
We good?

516
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,285
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

517
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,681
Blake: Come on.

518
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,224
( door buzzes )

519
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,856
lntel on the target.
What the fuck happened to you?

520
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,026
They needed some convincing.
Target confirmed.

521
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,831
The location of the data
is unknown so far.

522
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,337
Shit.

523
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,643
Open the doors to L block.

524
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,345
( buzzes )

525
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,183
We have guests.

526
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,485
Blake: Fuck.

527
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,090
Ready? Three, two one.

528
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,524
Who the hell are those guys?

529
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,262
Who the fuck are they?

530
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,364
Cross and Manning
were waiting for a team,

531
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,239
the HSO team
l think they called it.

532
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,513
Why were they waiting for
a high-speed operating team?

533
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,947
Cross-- that's the guy in holding--

534
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,885
he's a private contractor,
trains teams like that,

535
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,115
one of those shadow guys,
ex-Special Forces.

536
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,818
He came in to shut down the site,
brought in Manning.

537
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,051
Collins, we have an intrusion
in the motor pool--

538
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,360
a three-man HSO team.
Stand by.

539
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,161
l'm gonna shut off the power
in the cell blocks.

540
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,668
Get your people in there now.

541
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,192
Collins: 10-4.

542
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,705
Team one, sweep sector seven,
kill everyone.

543
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,605
Teams two and three,
set up perimeter defenses.

544
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,167
My team, tight to me.
Let's move.

545
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,320
( device squealing )

546
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,460
Motherfucker.

547
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,485
Boo.

548
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,021
God damn, it's getting funnier
every time l do it.

549
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,697
Yeah, well, see if l come to save
your ass next time.

550
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,930
Save my ass?

551
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,961
Fuck.

552
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,099
Well, l'm glad to see
you're still breathing.

553
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,668
- So what have we got?
- l made contact with those assholes.

554
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,543
They're after one of
the female detainees.

555
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,913
Sounded like she had some info
somebody wanted.

556
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,578
- So where's Cross?
- Fucked if l know. He's not with you?

557
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,019
No, he said he'd meet us
up here.

558
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,680
They'll be going after him.

559
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,817
We need to assess
enemy strength,

560
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,158
engage, kill,
clear access for him.

561
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,755
He'll find us.
You got gear?

562
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,197
Not much.

563
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,860
Hand it over.

564
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,926
A little more effective
than a screwdriver.

565
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,460
A screwdriver worked on you,
didn't it?

566
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,097
Yeah.

567
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,131
You need to wake up.

568
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,574
No sign of him.
Hallway clear.

569
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,173
Go, go.

570
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,723
They're gonna sweep past
on a perimeter check.

571
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,565
They know we're here.

572
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,502
We need to get off this video grid
and buy some real estate.

573
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,373
Move.

574
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,955
Hold up.

575
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,363
Man: l think l see something.

576
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,890
Manning: Contact, 1 2.

577
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,495
Man: l hear them. They should be
right through this door.

578
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,439
( gunfire )

579
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,733
Man: Move it!

580
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,424
Clear.

581
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,348
Clear. Dead check.

582
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,781
Okay, stay tight.

583
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,349
Grab the radio.
We can track their movements.

584
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,380
Got it.

585
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,331
- ( steam hissing )
- ( rhythmic banging )

586
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,399
Got Cross again.

587
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,202
You said these guys were
ex-Special Forces?

588
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,575
Yeah.

589
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,308
The background is
Cross is an operational genius

590
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,909
and Manning's a weapons expert,
a bulldozer on the ground.

591
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,812
l guarantee
when they find each other,

592
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,846
we'll be facing
a coordinated assault.

593
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:31,787
Collins, you have got
to ramp it up and get it done.

594
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,263
Divert more men
to sector seven now.

595
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,662
Collins: There's no MPs.
Where are the prisoners?

596
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,192
Fields: Should be
near the door.

597
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,070
They're not here.

598
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,083
Please, no, no, no.

599
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,278
Tell me where she is,
or l'm done being nice.

600
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,291
Oh, God, l don't--

601
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,589
l overheard Cross and Manning

602
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,095
on the radio, a security thing.

603
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,997
Because of the garbage truck,
they must have moved them.

604
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,896
Where? Where?

605
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,871
There's only one other
open block.

606
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,180
G block, go.

607
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,325
( metal groaning )

608
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,204
Terrence, are you still there?

609
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,442
Terrence: Yes, sir.
Do you want me to meet you?

610
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,646
No, sit tight and keep your head down
or it will probably get blown off.

611
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,414
Copy that.

612
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,699
- Esmeralda, come on.
- What's going on?

613
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,894
- We have to hide, come on.
- No. No.

614
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,767
We have to stay low.
You have to stay quiet.

615
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,534
- Okay, this way, then. This way.
- No, no, this way, come on.

616
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,769
- Let go of me.
- Esmeralda, look,

617
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,107
l will keep you safe.
l promise.

618
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,476
- Okay?
- Okay.

619
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,003
Come on.

620
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,007
There you go. Shh.

621
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,816
( distant gunshot )

622
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,016
( distant rapid gunfire )

623
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,489
( men shouting )

624
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:57,401
Man: Where are you going?
What's going on?

625
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,336
Man: Where are you going?
What's going on?

626
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,008
Sorry.

627
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,177
l just didn't want
any friendly accidents.

628
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,484
Cross, it's me.

629
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,816
What's going on?

630
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,122
lt's a targeted extraction.

631
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,719
They're killing
anybody they see,

632
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,252
so we want to kill them
first, you hear?

633
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,061
- So we should get the hell out of here.
- Negative.

634
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,796
lf somebody comes,
l'll lay down cover fire

635
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,066
- and buy you time.
- Do it.

636
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,011
All right, watch your
partners' backs.

637
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,139
They're gonna try to track me
on security cams,

638
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,674
so if you can pin them down,
buy me some time.

639
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,158
Man: Hey, what's going on
out there?

640
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,594
( pounding )
Fuck, what's going on?

641
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,927
Man: What the hell?

642
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,229
( men continue shouting )

643
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,346
Jesus, finally.
You took long enough.

644
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,753
l went over your file.
l've been in this game long enough

645
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,814
to know that someone
has phonied it up.

646
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,257
You still think l'm crazy?

647
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,160
Which means probably
someone wants you dead.

648
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,461
lf you listen to me,
do what l say,

649
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,027
l'll kill them
before they kill you, you hear?

650
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,137
Now, l don't know exactly
how you fit in this picture.

651
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:55,345
l'm assuming either you're
with them or you're with me.

652
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,320
The long and the short is,
do what l say,

653
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,722
be smart-- you'll do well.

654
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,749
lf you don't listen to me

655
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,025
and l find for one reason
or another you're with them

656
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,055
or you make a false move,

657
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,329
l'll kill you
just like l kill them.

658
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,131
We cool?

659
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,694
All right, come on over
to my left.

660
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,673
You stay on my right,
stay a little bit behind me,

661
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,834
and let's go.

662
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,515
( rapid gunfire )

663
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,195
You three, with me.

664
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,401
You two, take out the MP

665
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,774
and sweep the block
for the target. Go.

666
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,412
Man: Section G clear.

667
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,118
Open all the doors in G block.
Lock everything else down.

668
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,922
l want my men to have
a clear run in there.

669
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,587
Warden: You can't do that.

670
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,223
That sector houses high-risk detainees.
You can't let those animals out.

671
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,392
- Blake: Do it.
- You got it.

672
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,300
( buzzes )

673
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,180
( laughs )

674
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,306
So what's your story?

675
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:36,369
l'm a courier for
a non-US intelligence agency.

676
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,746
Sometimes l work with friendlies
and sometimes enemies,

677
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,081
but all of it
off the official radar.

678
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:45,952
My contact on my last drop
was a ClA op.

679
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,859
So how did you get here?

680
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,555
Well, my contact
was assassinated

681
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,690
and then all channels
went dark.

682
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,257
l got away
and then l got picked up.

683
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,303
And then l ended up here.

684
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,899
Now l got one message
from my handlers--

685
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,877
to sit tight because there was
some kind of internal problem--

686
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,107
and then nothing.

687
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,541
We'll talk about that.
Let's keep moving.

688
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,762
Cross: Hold up.
Don't move. Don't breathe.

689
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,832
( device squealing )

690
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,746
What's up?

691
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,345
Mines. Cut one of the beams,
they go off.

692
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,618
We can't go that way.
Follow me.

693
00:54:56,393 --> 00:55:00,056
Man: Corridor six clear.
Heading to the rendezvous point.

694
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,887
( rhythmic banging )

695
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,093
So do you know
who killed your contact?

696
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,931
lt felt like a ClA kill squad.

697
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,403
l've seen them do the thing
a dozen times. lt was classic.

698
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,737
So they were trying to isolate you
and retrieve information.

699
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,765
What are you carrying?

700
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,971
You tell me.
You know the drill.

701
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,604
They don't tell me anything.

702
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,343
They upload the information
onto an implant.

703
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,578
lt's usually
military intelligence.

704
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,676
Where's the implant?

705
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,450
lt's right there.

706
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,150
Yeah, l've seen those before.

707
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,457
You can upload and download data
via a short-range transmission,

708
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,896
but the chip also monitors
the electrical impulses of your heart.

709
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,296
The problem is

710
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,998
if you get killed,
it wipes the intel.

711
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,132
Are the police at least
gonna come and help us?

712
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,613
Sweetheart, this is a top secret
military dark facility.

713
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,013
The police do not know
about this place,

714
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,642
never could, never will.

715
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,848
But you don't have to worry, 'cause
if somebody tries to come and kill you,

716
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,413
they gotta come through me
and my friends.

717
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,448
What's that noise?

718
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,518
Pipes, man. They run
all the way through the prison.

719
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,552
The inmates use them
to communicate.

720
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,224
l have an MP held up
in the kitchen.

721
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,256
He's trying to let us know
he's all right.

722
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,001
Man: Hey, boss man.

723
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,268
Charlotte, get over here.
Now get down.

724
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,298
Hey, boss man.

725
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,903
We know you got some women back there.
Just give us one.

726
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,936
We'll take our frustrations
out on her.

727
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:02,179
Or you could fuck her yourself
and just give us your keys.

728
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,776
Cross: l got a better idea.

729
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,050
Why don't you fuck your mama
and one of your pet poodles?

730
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,750
( gunfire )

731
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,886
They found the weapons.

732
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:36,039
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

733
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,944
You fucking pussy.

734
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,891
l have the asset and confirmation
of the chip implant and location.

735
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,330
Cross is
right behind me.

736
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,392
Get to the extraction point.

737
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,300
How do you want me
to do that? l'm lost.

738
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,465
You see where she is? What's
the quickest way to the garbage room?

739
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,975
lt's hard to say.

740
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,002
lf you want to keep on breathing,
you'd better figure it out.

741
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,446
From where she is,

742
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,473
she'd have to go
through the kitchen

743
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,678
and then skirt B and C blocks.

744
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,612
Collins, we have the asset.

745
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,785
She's being pursued by Cross
towards the kitchen in your sector.

746
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,885
Take out Cross,
rendezvous with Charlotte,

747
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,329
and get her
to the extraction point.

748
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,798
Rendezvous with Collins in the kitchen.
We'll open the doors.

749
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,824
Head to the kitchen.

750
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,463
Happy to see a familiar face?

751
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,167
Manning, contact, 1 2.

752
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,261
Pull back.

753
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,737
Pull back.

754
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,570
Hold your fire.

755
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,582
Having fun yet?

756
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,214
Fuck, l'm having a blast.

757
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:04,021
We've been clearing these
motherfuckers as we find them.

758
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,154
They're heading for the kitchen.
You want to hit that bitch together?

759
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,460
l'd love to, but unfortunately
they're too mobile.

760
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,490
She'll be gone
before we get there.

761
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,468
l need to hit
the control room.

762
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,733
Now l can track her
from there.

763
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,865
We've got time,
'cause they can't kill her yet.

764
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,966
Clear.

765
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,409
Another little problem--

766
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,243
we have one of the MPs
held up in the kitchen

767
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,112
and the bad guys
are headed that way.

768
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,983
Shit. Poor motherfucker
ain't got a chance.

769
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,455
- Let me see what l can do.
- Yes, sir.

770
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,514
You guys, l want you
to sweep up the rear,

771
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,617
make sure Manning's six is clear.

772
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,254
l'll radio when l hit the target.

773
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,522
All right, let's do it.

774
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,443
Do you think anyone heard
your signals?

775
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,952
- ( whispers )
- No, wait.

776
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,390
Blake: Kitchen, l have movement
by cold storage.

777
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,937
( rustling )

778
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,523
- ( Esmeralda screams )
- Shut up. Bring them over here now.

779
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,525
lt's Terrence-- an MP.

780
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,470
Tell Cross and Manning
everything is clear down here.

781
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,375
Tell them you have the girl.

782
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,343
This is Terrence.
We are in the kitchen.

783
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,160
Terrence: lt's a trap.
Mayday, Mayday!

784
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,130
- No!
- ( two gunshots )

785
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,890
Collins:
We have the asset.

786
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,595
Blake: Get her out of the kitchens.
Send her to the extraction point.

787
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,626
Collins: Copy that.

788
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,474
Blake: Contact,
l have movement.

789
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,522
Looks like Manning's coming
through your sector.

790
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,582
Where?

791
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,330
Blake: l lost him.
He's got to be there somewhere.

792
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,359
Extraction in 10 minutes.

793
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,394
Fan out.

794
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,567
Mess with me, l'll gouge your
eyes out with my fingers.

795
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,750
( screams )

796
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,921
( screaming )

797
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,406
( two gunshots )

798
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,082
Make a noise, you die.

799
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,386
Hey, are you okay?

800
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,757
You like that shit?

801
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,466
What the fuck, baby?

802
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,497
Holy shit.

803
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,729
My kind of woman.

804
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,651
( gasps )

805
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,525
You think you're going to enjoy
yourself, baby cakes?

806
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:01,791
l don't.

807
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,390
- ( screams )
- l'm gonna take good care of you.

808
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,628
No! No. No!

809
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,699
No. No!

810
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,400
Shut up, bitch!

811
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,936
Please stop.
Please stop.

812
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,916
You're gonna--
you're gonna like it.

813
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,113
Oh, yeah.

814
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,145
No!

815
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,516
( laughs )

816
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,686
Blake:
Where's the asset?

817
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,495
We've been in here too long already.
We have to move.

818
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,025
Working on it.

819
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,765
No. No.

820
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,469
Come here.

821
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:55,142
( Samantha exclaiming )
No. No. No.

822
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,390
Hey, fuckhead, over here.

823
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:08,986
Fresh meat.

824
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:34,353
Yes, bitch?

825
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,941
( screaming )
Bitch!

826
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,102
Back to business.

827
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,341
l'm gonna give you something
to think about.

828
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,116
See, you're lucky. l was gonna
kill you and cut the chip out.

829
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,487
But now l know
l can't do that.

830
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:19,119
lt's a good thing l didn't
fuck up Cross before l found out.

831
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,356
So you're not gonna die just yet,

832
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,366
not before l get that data
scanned out of you.

833
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,890
When l do,

834
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:28,835
guess where
l'm gonna stick this?

835
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,903
( stick clatters )

836
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,344
Got the bitch.
What's the situation?

837
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,372
Let's bounce.
Open everything-- all doors.

838
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,547
Get out of there and meet me
at the extraction point with the asset.

839
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,287
Garbage room-- show me.

840
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:50,985
Now.

841
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,392
Come on, come on.

842
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:14,112
l should have known you were a plant
when they picked you up from state pen.

843
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,346
No con fights like that.
You're goddamn ClA.

844
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:18,546
So what if l am?

845
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,350
So you're supposed to be
on my side.

846
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,516
Says who?

847
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,890
My contact was ClA.

848
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,889
Why are you doing this?

849
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,092
We both want the same things.

850
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,760
We're both helping
our countries--

851
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,362
No, you just want to feel good
about yourself and l want to get paid.

852
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,270
You're so fucking dumb,
you didn't even know

853
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,935
what you were handing your contact
before we capped him.

854
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,137
lf you did, you'd be lying
on a beach somewhere by now

855
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,703
with a different face,
laughing at all of us.

856
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,011
Too bad for you.

857
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,540
Come on.

858
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,883
Manning over radio:
Cross, they have the target.

859
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,546
Cross: Rendezvous
with the team.

860
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:28,385
We'll meet up at the extraction point
in the garbage room.

861
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:46,173
Charlotte, where are you?
Let's go. l want that package.

862
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,674
Getting there. They didn't give me
a map when they booked me in.

863
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,078
This wasn't supposed
to be my job.

864
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,647
Look, you hit F block,
then C block.

865
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,176
Let's move it.

866
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:02,547
Move it.

867
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,267
What the fuck
happened to you?

868
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:16,794
Got my ass whupped
by my new girlfriend.

869
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,705
They acquired the target.
Cross will be tracking her.

870
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,107
The extraction point
is the garbage room.

871
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,442
Cross wants to lock down
all the doors,

872
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,003
contain the extraction team.

873
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,142
You have five minutes to meet up.
Use what you can to get out.

874
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,709
l'm gonna circle around the back, make
sure they don't hit us from the rear.

875
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,584
- All right, got it.
- Move.

876
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,317
Boys.

877
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,619
( keyboard keys clicking )

878
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,057
Cross: Time to lock it up.
lt's my game now.

879
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,492
( buzzing )

880
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,208
( gate buzzes )

881
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,235
We're trapped.

882
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,439
Blake: Where?

883
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,142
F block, covered walkway.

884
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,945
l've got keys, but it's gonna
slow me down.

885
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,009
Blake: We're right behind you.

886
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,315
Move.

887
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,345
Warden,

888
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,790
get out your goddamn keys.

889
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,277
Open the fucking gate.

890
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,285
Why do you keep
putting your keys away, huh?

891
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,809
Are you clowning around
with me?

892
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,446
Huh? Are you
clowning with me?

893
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:15,751
Please.

894
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,816
lt's not far.

895
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,795
Move it.

896
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:30,898
Whoa.

897
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,438
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

898
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,941
Get to the extraction point now.
Secure the area.

899
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,914
Go, go.

900
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,780
Hold it.

901
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,782
Come on.

902
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,722
Come on, come on, Warden.

903
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,193
( gate buzzes )

904
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,123
Oh, fuck.

905
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,995
All right, maintenance room
should only be 100 yards from here.

906
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,029
Let's start blowing doors.

907
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,844
lf l'm gonna die, you son of a bitch,
l'm taking you with me.

908
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:52,751
( gate buzzes )

909
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,948
Secure the door.

910
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,550
Come on, jerk-off,
get going.

911
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,967
Okay, Warden,
you were great.

912
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,404
( two gunshots )

913
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,125
Charlotte: The implant is
just below her left breast.

914
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,531
You need some kind of
special scanner to get it out.

915
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,559
Just shut the fuck up
for five minutes.

916
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,094
l've done this about 50 times.
l know what l'm doing.

917
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:45,663
Watch my back.

918
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,907
( beeping )

919
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:10,554
l am so gonna enjoy this.

920
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,996
Are you gonna work out
or are you gonna fight?

921
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,901
l guess we'll find out.

922
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,084
( laughs )

923
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:07,154
No pain, no gain.

924
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,503
That's it. l've got it.

925
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,806
You traitor.

926
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,505
Kill the bitch.
Let's bounce.

927
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,240
Samantha: Cross!

928
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,685
- Charlotte: Cover.
- Blake: Give me that.

929
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,424
lsn't that the tactical genius?

930
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,393
l got you outmanned
and outgunned two to one.

931
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,523
l guess you're
not so clever after all.

932
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,965
lt ain't the amount.
lt's the skill.

933
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,367
The skill the guy's got--
that's what it is.

934
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,394
Save it for your girlfriend.

935
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,100
Want to hear
something funny, though?

936
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,370
All right.

937
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,400
See my smiling face?

938
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:06,380
lt's the last thing you're gonna see
before you hit your grave.

939
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:18,249
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

940
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,022
Drop your fucking weapons!

941
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:23,053
- Put them down now! Put them down!
- Drop your weapons now!

942
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,793
You motherfucker, drop it!

943
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,631
- Drop it! Drop your weapon!
- ( men shouting )

944
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,068
( shouts )

945
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,949
Cover me.

946
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:54,225
l'm out.

947
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,661
Cover him!

948
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,950
You're dead, bitch.

949
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,433
Keep them pinned down.
l'm gonna flank them.

950
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,136
l'll catch you long.
Go, go, go.

951
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,662
Motherfucker!

952
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:35,345
l got four of them.
How about you?

953
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:37,851
l got some myself.

954
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,951
Look at this sorry-ass bitch.

955
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,514
( chuckling )

956
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,116
Okay.

957
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,060
Yeah, we made it.

958
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:56,361
God damn, which one of you
motherfuckers killed my future ex-wife?

959
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,406
Cross.

960
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:05,002
You're out of ammo.

961
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:07,037
So am l.

962
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:11,082
Why don't we talk?

963
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,651
We've got a lot in common,
you and l--

964
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:23,459
Special Forces,

965
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,728
black ops, ClA.

966
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,291
No, l'm not Special Forces.

967
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,667
l was never Special Forces.
l was a Marine.

968
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,638
Whatever.

969
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,233
What the hell are we trying
to kill each other for, huh?

970
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:37,802
( throws down gun )
This isn't about patriotism

971
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:41,076
with a flag.
This is about money.

972
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:42,810
( throws down gun )

973
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,011
You know who
Samantha's contact was?

974
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,850
lt was a money guy.

975
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:49,288
He delivered secret government funds
to favored efforts

976
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,588
in trouble spots
around the world.

977
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:54,527
He was a bag man
for the ClA

978
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,553
delivering bribes
and payoffs.

979
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:59,191
And that chip that was
implanted in her...

980
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:01,565
Yeah?

981
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,038
That contained secret
financial information.

982
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:07,473
With that, we could access

983
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,841
at least $200 million
of whitewashed money--

984
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,278
clean money.

985
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,179
You know what you could do
with that?

986
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,752
You could open yourself
a free clinic in Mogadishu

987
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:22,051
or an orphanage in Mexico

988
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,149
or a bordello in Berlin--

989
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,092
whatever the fuck you want.

990
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,526
Right?

991
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:28,722
Yeah.

992
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,754
You and l both know

993
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:33,266
this isn't about good guys
and bad guys anymore.

994
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,293
We split that money
right down the middle.

995
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:40,273
You walk away a rich guy.
l walk away a rich guy.

996
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:43,277
Maybe you really would
give me $100 million.

997
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,079
There's your act of good faith.

998
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,988
You know, l'm just thinking
to myself

999
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:59,550
that somewhere

1000
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,994
in the back of my mind,

1001
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:04,327
l kind of feel like

1002
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:08,131
you're not being
completely sincere.

1003
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,436
What, you don't trust me?

1004
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:19,412
Not exactly.

1005
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:11,729
Look at you, man.

1006
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,996
You're dead.

1007
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:18,335
Money can't buy life.
Money can't buy honor.

1008
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,565
You ain't got shit.

1009
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,605
l don't know what's wrong
with you, man.

1010
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,272
Now you're dead.

1011
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,943
Argh! Jeez.

1012
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:36,886
You talk about
being a warrior.

1013
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,893
How does a warrior
break his word of honor?

1014
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:44,895
You know the story about
the scorpion and the frog?

1015
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:46,524
- Yeah.
- Well, that's me.

1016
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,296
l'm the fucking bad guy.

1017
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:49,826
Yeah? Well, l'm the good guy.

1018
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:17,394
Hi.

1019
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:19,626
You all right?

1020
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,932
( Cross laughs )

1021
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,294
Make sure that's set right.
Got a long trip.

1022
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,631
Well, l need a minute
with you, brother.

1023
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,661
Yeah, l got a minute.
What you got?

1024
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,139
You know, this whole thing
was about money--

1025
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:02,165
$200 million.

1026
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:05,838
l got the bank accounts
with all the numbers right here.

1027
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,043
lt's all black ops money,

1028
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,415
all off the books.

1029
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,750
Ain't nobody to give it back to.

1030
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:15,779
l'm giving you half.

1031
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:19,190
What do you want to do
with it, man?

1032
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:22,662
Shit, probably use half of it
for some paybacks.

1033
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:25,666
Yeah, l'd like that myself.

1034
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:30,495
Maybe use the other half
to start up a security company,

1035
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,972
buy some toys.

1036
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:34,668
What the hell
are you gonna do?

1037
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:38,509
l think l'll give half
to St. Jude's in Memphis.

1038
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,912
The other half l'll use
to have some fun,

1039
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:43,712
help some of my friends
and my family.

1040
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,512
Listen, in about 48 hours, man,

1041
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:49,216
after you finish your thing,

1042
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,281
l was hoping you could meet me
in Port D'Azul.

1043
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,849
You know that place,
don't you?

1044
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:55,657
Yeah, l know the place.

1045
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:58,062
lt's where we used to do
the mission debriefs.

1046
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:00,761
What the hell are you
cooking up now?

1047
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,395
l got another operation for us.

1048
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:05,496
l think you're gonna like it.

1049
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,530
Remember, man,

1050
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:10,567
it ain't over till we're dead.

1051
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:18,352
l hope you like to fly, baby,
'cause it's time to go.
