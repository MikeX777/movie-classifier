1
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,840
You!

2
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,724
What are you doing?
No... no!

3
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,164
Oh, what awful weather!

4
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,417
It may be romantic,
<i>mais très emmerdant,</i> huh?

5
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,298
<i>Mais oui.</i>

6
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,639
Ireland is very beautiful
but it's raining all the time.

7
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,178
What a bore!

8
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,644
But it's the rain
that makes it so green and beautiful.

9
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,936
Yes, yes, I suppose you're right.

10
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,104
Where were you going?

11
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,025
Well, I thought that you were late
so I was going to do a little job.

12
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,029
Hm. Thank you for visiting, dear.

13
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,868
I didn't think you could get up
so early in the morning.

14
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,989
I could hardly believe it myself.

15
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,582
If I didn't know that my husband
was not in Dublin

16
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,879
I would have thought that he was
the author of such a miracle.

17
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,672
Now you're getting evil.

18
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,715
Perhaps, but I'm not playing
the role of the jealous wife.

19
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,850
- I know.
- Come on.

20
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,973
Here, put these parcels
in the boot of the car.

21
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,268
Er, perhaps it'd be better
to put them next to me, on the seat.

22
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,188
Yes, perhaps it's better.

23
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,313
But if you have something else to do,
I'll drive the car myself. Come on.

24
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,030
No, no, madam.

25
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,117
I beg your pardon,
but my business is not important.

26
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,244
It can wait.

27
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,613
- Where can I drop you?
- I have my own car, thanks.

28
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,911
Oh... <i>Bien alors.</i>

29
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,541
Mandel, stop first
at Trinity College, then.

30
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,083
Yes, madam.

31
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,794
Bernard!

32
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,016
Bernard, <i>venez en voiture, chéri.</i>

33
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,387
But... Bernard, what are you doing?
Come on, shoo!

34
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,072
Oh, my God!

35
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,416
What happened?
Let's call the police.

36
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,535
Yes, let's call the police.

37
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,635
Oh...

38
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,521
Hello? Hello, Jerry, it's you?

39
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,982
Oh, Jerry! Something horrible
has happened.

40
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,568
Yes. Yes, here in the embassy.

41
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,440
No, His Excellency is away as always.
He's in Switzerland.

42
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,114
- What are you doing?
- Jerry? It's me.

43
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,704
No, I came back last night. Listen,
you'd better come over right away.

44
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,825
As counsel of the embassy
you will have to look after this affair.

45
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,041
Yes.

46
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,630
I don't think there's any need for Bernard
to overhear this conversation.

47
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,215
- Ah, but it was he who discovered her.
- Well, exactly.

48
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,335
We must make him forget
what he has seen.

49
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,675
- Darling. Darling, go.
- Bernard.

50
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,639
- Go upstairs.
- Go to your room.

51
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,682
I, uh... I came back earlier
than I expected.

52
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,605
It never stopped raining in Davos.

53
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,195
Did you call on Marc?

54
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,736
No. No, I didn't stop over in Zürich.

55
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,568
Were you alone?

56
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,447
As always, my darling.

57
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,915
Now, when Jerry comes,

58
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,707
will you please tell him to get in touch
with the police immediately?

59
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,051
- Who are you?
- My name is Johnson. I'm the doctor.

60
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,018
Oh, I've called for him.

61
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, have you written your report?

62
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,021
Yes, it's right here.

63
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,898
And... do you think it is possible
to recognize this person?

64
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,945
I would say it's impossible.

65
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,660
The murderer has done a perfect job.

66
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,280
A specialist, I would say.

67
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,496
Like me.

68
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,376
Inspector Lawrence.

69
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,336
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,505
- This letter is for you, sir.
- Thank you.

71
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,057
This must be the woman
who was in the boot of the Rolls-Royce.

72
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:14,404
Really? What, and nothing else?
Not even a letter?

73
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,365
What did you expect?
The murderer's name and address?

74
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,075
And an invitation to drop by for tea
between five and six?

75
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,071
- No, but... you never know.
- Get a move on.

76
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,869
According to this passport,
she was born in Holland.

77
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,910
- So?
- Well, it may be a coincidence,

78
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,663
but Mr Sobiesky,
before he came to Dublin,

79
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,086
was ambassador to The Hague.

80
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,301
We'd better call him in
for questioning.

81
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,841
For God's sake, man, wake up!

82
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,808
Do you think we're enough to call
an ambassador in for questioning?

83
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:48,475
It will be a lot if we get permission
to question the members of his staff.

84
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,689
I'd like to see him try and stop us.

85
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,900
He can do it quite easily.

86
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:57,397
I'll have to get onto the Foreign Ministry
if I'm to get to the bottom of this enquiry.

87
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,991
- Will they give us permission?
- Let's hope so but it won't be much use.

88
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,533
At the most, all we can do it is
to get him declared <i>persona non grata.</i>

89
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,892
While we wait for the bloody bureaucrats
to make up their minds

90
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,061
our boy will have time to slit
three or four other throats.

91
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,365
Is there nothing else we can do?

92
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,293
Don't worry, Johnson.

93
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,415
I'll go on making my enquiries
all the same.

94
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,043
And I couldn't care less
if I am accused of being unorthodox.

95
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,047
- Get me?
- But how?

96
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,182
You'll find out.

97
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,401
Give her a good rub down.

98
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,451
Your Excellency,
Inspector Lawrence is here to see you.

99
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,170
Why didn't you tell me this before?

100
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,712
He arrived without warning.
He's in the library.

101
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,638
Inspector Lawrence
of the Homicide Squad, Your Excellency.

102
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,257
He insisted on speaking to you.

103
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,385
- Hello, Inspector. Please.
- How do you do, Your Excellency?

104
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,556
Oh, uh...

105
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,574
Matches.

106
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,065
I'm sorry to trouble you,
Mr Ambassador,

107
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,062
but I find myself in a particularly...
embarrassing position.

108
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,938
I quite understand.

109
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,942
And I'm going to collaborate
with the police.

110
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,364
Naturally, I expect this investigation
to be carried out

111
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,579
- with the utmost discretion.
- Yes, Mr Ambassador.

112
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,541
There's a question
I should like to ask you.

113
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,455
Did you know that woman?

114
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,764
- Which woman?
- I meant the one... the one that was in...

115
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,850
Oh, the one who was
in the luggage boot of my car?

116
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,844
Well, I might tell you, Inspector,

117
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,563
after one glance and...

118
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,229
quite frankly I didn't feel
like taking a second one,

119
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,900
the lady seemed to me
utterly unrecognizable.

120
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,319
Because of that, do you think
the man who killed her...

121
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,451
Or woman.

122
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,864
What makes you think
the murderer might be a woman?

123
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,244
Well, why not? It's just a thought.

124
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,037
After all, as far as I can see,

125
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,456
there's no evidence
one way or the other.

126
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,126
You spoke of the man
who committed the murder.

127
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,749
I seem to suggest
that it might have been a woman.

128
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,751
Why? Isn't it possible?

129
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,550
Certainly, it is possible.

130
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,264
The use of vitriol
does suggest a woman's hand.

131
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,133
Or a colored person's.

132
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,352
They're expert at such things.

133
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,063
I'm grateful for your suggestion.

134
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,684
Don't rely too much on the words
of a diplomat, Inspector.

135
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,811
Remember we are all professional liars.

136
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,859
We may do it with a certain amount
of style and elegance

137
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,199
but... we are still liars.

138
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,411
So you have no idea who might
have put that corpse in your car?

139
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,745
Or why?

140
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:39,084
No. No, I haven't the faintest idea.

141
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,544
However, if it's any use to you,

142
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,835
I might suggest that this could be
an attempt to create a big scandal,

143
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,050
which would compromise relations
between our two countries

144
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,841
which right now
happen to be excellent.

145
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,804
Yes, I suppose so.

146
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,424
You're most kind, Your Excellency.

147
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,846
- I don't know how to...
- Oh, not at all. It's my duty

148
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,016
to collaborate with the authorities
of the country of which I'm a guest.

149
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,185
It's a matter of courtesy, hmm?

150
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,526
Would you allow me to question
some members of the embassy staff?

151
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,195
Yes, of course.

152
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,737
But not here.
Call them to the police station, will you?

153
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,785
Whom do you want to see?

154
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,225
For the moment, it will be enough
to talk to the chauffeur.

155
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,865
And the governess.
Later, perhaps...

156
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
Well, let's hope
the matter will end there.

157
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,495
It will be so much better for all of us.
I'll take you to your car.

158
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,247
- No, don't worry.
- No, it's a pleasure.

159
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,274
- Maggie?
- You are here too.

160
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,989
Yes. Who is it they're questioning
in there now?

161
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,109
Mandel, the chauffeur.

162
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,827
Listen, Maggie, there is one thing
I would like to ask.

163
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,412
You can be sure, Miss,

164
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,157
I know what I have to say
and what I haven't.

165
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not so stupid
as to tell the police

166
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,791
everything about
the ambassador's private life.

167
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,960
That would be quite useless
to the police

168
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,129
and dangerous for me.

169
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,386
- So...
- What do you want me to say?

170
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,474
You've been making questions now
for two hours

171
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,437
and I don't know what I can tell you
that I haven't already told you.

172
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,271
You haven't told me much.

173
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,775
I'm sorry. I suffer from conjunctivitis.
I can't bear the light.

174
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,781
Rather inconvenient
for your kind of job.

175
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,950
- Yes, it is.
- You haven't replied.

176
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,745
I've told you everything.
That night I went out as usual.

177
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,869
To go to the pictures, wasn't it?

178
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,997
Yes, to the pictures,
even if I can't prove it.

179
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,635
You can take your glasses off now.
There's not too much light in here.

180
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,303
It was almost midnight.

181
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,431
I got home. I put the car in the garage
and locked the doors.

182
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,057
Yes, you told us that.

183
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,713
I'm telling you
for the hundredth time.

184
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,357
Take it easy.
We're just asking questions.

185
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,114
But you ask questions
like you suspect that I'm guilty.

186
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,575
That's your opinion.

187
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,445
He only wants to know
if you've forgotten some detail

188
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,037
that might be important to us.

189
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,077
I do not forget anything.

190
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,337
All this means, therefore,

191
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,048
is that when you got back
to the embassy,

192
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,793
somebody else could have put
the corpse in the boot of the car.

193
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,763
That's what I say, and the next morning
I brought the car around

194
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,429
and was waiting for Mrs Sobiesky
to come down.

195
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,223
That's not what the governess said.

196
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,765
Why? What the hell did she...?

197
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,684
That stupid...

198
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,808
- And so?
- A lot.

199
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,436
She said that when she came out
of the embassy with Mrs Sobiesky

200
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,406
it looked as if you were in a hurry
to go somewhere

201
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,196
and that you only reversed the car
because you saw them coming out.

202
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,535
Well, I didn't think
that was worth mentioning.

203
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,245
Why did you take the car out?

204
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,123
Well, that morning
I thought they would come out late

205
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,664
so I thought I would dash up
to the cleaners.

206
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,331
Are these the cleaners?

207
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,796
- Yes, that's the place.
- What was so urgent?

208
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,416
Did you have a shirt
that was dirtier than usual?

209
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,795
I don't know what you mean.
I'm only telling you the facts.

210
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,514
We appreciate that, even if sometimes
your facts are incomplete.

211
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,806
It's a question of distraction.
Then what?

212
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,769
That's all, nothing else.

213
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,604
Very well.

214
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,521
If in the future you should happen
to remember something else,

215
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,440
some detail
that you think is unimportant,

216
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,940
instead of keeping it to yourself,
you might let us know.

217
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,486
You can go now.

218
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,874
You can tell the ambassador
that so far as you are concerned

219
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,493
the investigation is over.

220
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,714
I won't see him again.
The ambassador has left.

221
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,424
- And besides...
- Besides?

222
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,762
Nothing.

223
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,568
Take it, but remember
this is the last time.

224
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,279
Now, get out and stay out.

225
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,458
Hmm. Is that all he gave you?

226
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,377
He gets tighter every day,
the old bastard.

227
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,679
I gave him what he asked for,
but it's the last time. I'm fed up.

228
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,654
All right, I agreed to keep your son,
but there's a limit to everything.

229
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,435
But... you could have let me
speak to him. Maybe...

230
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,483
No! No, this is the only way.

231
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,824
The sooner he goes back to Switzerland,
the better it is for all of us.

232
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,993
You frightened me, sweetheart.

233
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,041
You scare easily, don't you?

234
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,554
How did you manage to get in?

235
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,426
It doesn't require much imagination
to find a back entrance.

236
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,229
Guess who's here tonight.

237
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,482
I don't care.

238
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,734
How much?

239
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,023
Once when you offered
to give me money, as I recall,

240
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,150
you offered it with a certain flair.

241
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,405
And you too, when you asked for it.

242
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,452
I'm going to need more.

243
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,996
How much, then?

244
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,423
A lot.

245
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,378
And if I refuse?

246
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,806
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

247
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,889
Can you give me change
for the phone?

248
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,232
Sure.

249
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,441
Where did he go?

250
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,363
I don't know,

251
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,407
and I don't care.

252
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,081
- Mr Jones. Mr Jones!
- What's the problem?

253
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,047
Is that new singer.
She's dead in her dressing room.

254
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,252
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
Maybe I can help.

255
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,347
No, I think it's too late.
Anyway, you'd better come with me.

256
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,314
All right, go back.
There's nothing to see.

257
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,195
No.

258
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,816
Wilhelm, go to the door,
don't let anybody out and call the police.

259
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,444
Move back, please, everyone.
Come on now, move back.

260
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,197
Go back to the bar.
Go on, now.

261
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,429
All right, everybody,
keep calm now. It's only a fuse.

262
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,844
Please stay where you are.
Stay calm.

263
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,310
No one is to leave the premises, please.
We must wait until the Guards get here.

264
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,610
You're showing
a fine turn of speed there, Miss.

265
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,780
Getting a bit stuffy, wasn't it?
Are you running for your car?

266
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,900
No. I was with a friend.
We came in a taxi.

267
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,278
Ah. Well, never mind.
I'll give you a lift.

268
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,435
- Here, you'll need this.
- But I thought you had a car.

269
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,167
Oh, the only car you're going to see
around here is the paddy wagon.

270
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,831
- You mean the police?
- That's right,

271
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,750
only we call them the Guards.

272
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,965
Now, get your finger out and hop on.

273
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,014
- Who is your friend?
- A friend.

274
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,726
Would it be enough to say thank you
in return for your kindness?

275
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,720
Oh, there's no need for thanks.

276
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,515
All this trouble for nothing?

277
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,064
I didn't exactly say that.

278
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,566
Are you making for the airport?

279
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,655
No, I live outside Dublin.
You know the Manors?

280
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,320
- Uh-huh.
- You do?

281
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:05,660
Then to the Manors. Do you always take
advantage of disasters to pick girls up?

282
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,704
Well,
I wouldn't consider it a habit now.

283
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,996
- Do you have a name?
- Of course.

284
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,044
- Well, what is it?
- Helen.

285
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,047
Do you want to hear my life story too?

286
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,386
Turn in there.

287
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,813
Well, now, my fleet-footed filly,

288
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,604
are we going to have it off
in the bushes or on the bike?

289
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,818
Hmm. It's damp in the bushes.

290
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,653
You could have asked me
in a roundabout way

291
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,522
for a scotch or a cup of tea.

292
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,535
You know, I'm a great believer
in formality.

293
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,823
Like you.

294
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,698
Mm, you have
a nice turn of phrase too.

295
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,747
Here, now, as long as you're going
to keep me standing outside.

296
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,548
- Isn't this the place they found the...?
- That they found a corpse? Yes.

297
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,007
Curious, isn't it?

298
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,798
You picked me up in a club
where they found another corpse.

299
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,761
Funny it doesn't seem
to worry you very much.

300
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,472
Why should it?
I'm not the murderer.

301
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:08,978
Do you work here?

302
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,722
As the ambassador's daughter.

303
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,020
Shall we go in? You coming?

304
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,271
- Oh! Hello, Mandel.
- Good evening, Miss.

305
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,398
You look so strange.
Aren't your eyes better?

306
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,024
Much better, thank you.

307
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,737
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi. Good night.

308
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,384
Let's go upstairs
and have that whisky we talked about.

309
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,148
Well, now that's a good start.
Thank you.

310
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,447
Helen?
Would you come here for a moment?

311
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,410
That's my father.
I hope he's in a good mood.

312
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,370
By the way,
if he asks me who you are...?

313
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,616
Well, now, I've washed dishes,
swept the streets

314
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,913
and done a little gun-running.

315
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,709
If he waits a couple of years, he can
read the book I'm writing about my life.

316
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,496
Oh, that's my father.
He won't smoke any other brand.

317
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,793
But I've never known him
to finish one yet.

318
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,042
Would you like one?

319
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,169
Oh, no, I can't stand the things myself.

320
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,799
Shall we go
and hear some nice records?

321
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,393
- Aha! Would you call that diplomacy?
- Oh, don't be silly.

322
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,152
The bushes were never like this.

323
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,254
If you want anything,
help yourself.

324
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,249
Who are you calling?

325
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,369
Oh, there you are.

326
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,754
That's the way I like you.

327
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,347
Let's go.

328
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,692
Mother, the telephone.

329
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,657
Mother!

330
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,574
For pity's sake, it's the phone!

331
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,501
- Oh, Mother!
- Now, eat your dinner.

332
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,332
- Come on now, be a good pussy cat.
- Hello? Yes, it's himself.

333
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,753
Eat it up.

334
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,969
- Yes.
- Yes, you're a good pussy cat.

335
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,512
- Hello, Daddy. Hi, Granny!
- Sweetheart.

336
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,077
Find Granny's glasses
and put them on her, for the love of God.

337
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,095
Go on, pussy, eat it.
Eat it. Come on.

338
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,063
Now, where the devil
have they got to?

339
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,854
- All right, then.
- What is it, Sacha?

340
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,442
Come on. Not hungry?

341
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,653
- OK.
- Come on, now.

342
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,738
Oh, dear.

343
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,778
Give Granny a kiss, dear.

344
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,698
Oh... Thanks, dear.

345
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,747
Granny, why didn't you keep
your glasses on?

346
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,121
Daddy got angry
because you didn't as usual.

347
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,044
But I can't see anything.

348
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,839
And if I can't see
how can I find my glasses?

349
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,555
Anyway, if you didn't go out all the time,
you could answer the phone.

350
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,764
Hmm!

351
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,994
There, I've collected all the clippings
on those two murders

352
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,163
and I think I know who the killer is.

353
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,662
- Did you say something?
- What do you want me to say?

354
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,818
If you don't put on your glasses,
you'll never hear it. Keep 'em on a string.

355
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,242
- And didn't I tell you...?
- I just gave them to her!

356
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,309
Now, then... All right, Mother.

357
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,518
Hm...

358
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,605
Who is it, then?

359
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,891
You're pulling my leg.

360
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,984
Why, it never crossed my mind, Mother!

361
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,024
Oh, yes, you are. I know it.

362
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,523
You think because I'm old
and never go out

363
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,490
that I can't find out
who committed a crime

364
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,702
just by studying the facts of the case.

365
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,822
But you remember that old woman
in the Agatha Christie books?

366
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,374
You know I don't like detective stories.

367
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,121
That's another of your defects.
You read too little.

368
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,623
Dare say. Now,
who do you think is the killer?

369
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,672
Hold on to your seat, Daddy,
while Granny tells you.

370
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,136
As for you, young lady,
just you remember your place!

371
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,722
Now, then, Mother,
don't go changing the subject.

372
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,558
Come on, now.
Out with it, Miss Marple.

373
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,052
- Who is it?
- Are you listening?

374
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,224
- Well?
- Mmm-hmm.

375
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,940
It's the son of the ambassador.

376
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,186
- The son of the ambassador?
- Mmm-hmm.

377
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,028
No, no, no, no!

378
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,148
You'll be saying next
it's Father O'Connor.

379
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,615
Well!

380
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,326
- Daddy!
- What is it?

381
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,867
Daddy, where are you going?

382
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,957
Secret mission.

383
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,658
All right, now, get 'em up.

384
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,503
And don't you move.

385
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,374
Now, let's take a look
at your ugly mug.

386
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,911
God help...!

387
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,474
Like a whisky, John?

388
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,476
How, with these things on?

389
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,150
Take those handcuffs off him.

390
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,774
I told you I was going to use
unorthodox methods in this case.

391
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,151
He's my unorthodox method.

392
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,777
You might have told me that you...

393
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,371
that I'd find your unorthodox friend...
in that flat.

394
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,498
- It would have saved my chin.
- If you went there,

395
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,583
you went there on your own initiative.

396
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,545
Too much zeal sometimes
gets a man into trouble.

397
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,922
Go on.

398
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,508
Good luck.

399
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,725
- You were too hard on those two.
- Hmm.

400
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,521
They weren't exactly kidding either.

401
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,102
You haven't changed since...

402
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,407
You mean, since when I was
in your place, Lawrence?

403
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,201
'All right, then.

404
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,629
'I said, "Talk!"

405
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,580
'Talk!

406
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,672
'Talk! Talk!

407
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,965
'Talk! Damn you!'

408
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,271
'I know you did it! Talk!

409
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,002
'No, you don't.

410
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,337
'No!'

411
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,209
Why do you act this way?

412
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,592
I don't even know myself.

413
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,559
Could be the memory
of my wife's murder,

414
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,556
the thought that every criminal I meet
might be the killer.

415
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:12,736
When I saw your sergeant walk in,
my mind went suddenly haywire

416
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,073
because I thought he might be the one
that I've been looking for.

417
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,407
Thanks.

418
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,820
You know, I remember once in Brazil

419
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,416
I stepped on an iguana
hidden among the jungle foliage.

420
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,035
This murderer too
is certainly living amongst us,

421
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,254
perhaps under our very eyes.

422
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,125
You know, the iguana is clever
at disguising itself.

423
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,925
The only difference is that the iguana,
though horrible, is harmless,

424
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,141
while our murderer is probably
pleasant to look at

425
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,432
but he cuts throats
and uses vitriol.

426
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,725
It's his tongue of fire, you might say.

427
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,517
Now, then, about that girl.
Come off it.

428
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,358
Don't play the fool.
You know what I mean.

429
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,356
The ambassador's daughter.

430
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,735
Cultivate her. It could be useful.

431
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,236
It's the only discreet way we have

432
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,091
of finding out
what the ambassador is up to.

433
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,081
All right,

434
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,450
if you want.

435
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,041
Hell, what is she? Just another bird.

436
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,298
Try not to get into too much trouble.

437
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,385
You know the risk I took
giving you this job.

438
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,802
- I won't forget it.
- Where are you going now?

439
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,267
To the hospital,
to get myself sewn up.

440
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,647
Doctor, there's a man here
who needs your help.

441
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,395
- Well, then, sit him down.
- Come along.

442
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,403
Sit yourself down here.

443
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,162
I won't need your help for this job.
You may go.

444
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,129
Switch off the light, please.

445
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,010
It's rather a deep wound.

446
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,227
A fight?

447
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,564
You might say, yeah.

448
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:18,570
I'll have to... inform the police.

449
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,444
Oh, don't worry.

450
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,160
They were there at the time.

451
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,867
Don't move.

452
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,986
Do you think that they will find
the embassy murderer?

453
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,740
I wouldn't have any idea
and I couldn't care less.

454
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,917
The police will never find him.

455
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,543
Never.

456
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,920
He's too clever.

457
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,297
Much too clever.

458
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,389
Ow!

459
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,686
Good evening, sir.

460
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,780
Oh, Norton...

461
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:28,526
A bow of homage to the man
who took my girl from under my eyes.

462
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,744
And how is it you know my name?

463
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,739
Who doesn't know the name
of Inspector Norton?

464
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:38,539
Or should I say of ex-Inspector Norton,
known as "the brute"?

465
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,591
Doesn't it ever occur to you
that sooner or later

466
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,339
one of your victims
might try to do you?

467
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,175
Do you call that a threat?

468
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,012
No, only a little bit of advice.

469
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,342
Then here is a bit of advice
for you, my boy.

470
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,969
Don't run into me again.

471
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,817
Madam, I...

472
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,194
- Oh, hello.
- I'm sorry to be disturbing you.

473
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,492
No, you don't disturb me at all.

474
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,706
Helen won't be long.
Please sit down.

475
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,747
- Thank you.
- No, here. Here, beside me.

476
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,171
I was hoping, you see,

477
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,215
that I would be lucky enough
to have a little chat with your husband.

478
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,179
I mean, of course, His Excellency.

479
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,634
I am sorry, you are not lucky at all.

480
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,265
His Excellency has gone back
to Switzerland. I am alone.

481
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,890
As always.

482
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,730
The way you're saying it, I...

483
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,322
How do you expect me to say it?

484
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,612
It's the truth.

485
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:57,035
Behind... this facade
you are looking at

486
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:05,006
there is the most terrible,
unbelievable emptiness.

487
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,717
Between me and my children,
between me and...

488
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,386
...my husband.

489
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:17,726
It's what I suppose
they call nowadays uncommunicability.

490
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,061
Yes, uncommunicability!

491
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,478
<i>Je suis formidable, formidable.</i>

492
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,741
<i>♪ L'amour est un oiseau rebelle</i>

493
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:38,114
<i>♪ Que nul ne peut apprivoiser ♪</i>

494
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,076
But you see,

495
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:49,337
the terrible thing
is that I can't fire up.

496
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,836
At least not as I did before.

497
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,716
I'm no longer young.

498
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,592
But I'm not for the rubbish heap yet.

499
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,479
You shouldn't be talking like that.
You're a very beautiful woman.

500
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:07,730
You are sweet
but I know you don't mean it.

501
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,151
No, no, no, don't try to deny it.
I know you don't mean it.

502
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,866
Anyhow, it's very nice
to hear it said by...

503
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:19,705
such an attractive and charming man.

504
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,074
That's a marvelous fine lighter you have.

505
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,041
From Cartier.

506
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,503
I would willingly give it to you,
but I can't.

507
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,246
It was a present
from my first husband.

508
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,711
Yes.

509
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,802
When I married His Excellency

510
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,967
I had already two children,
Helen and Marc.

511
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:42,436
Bernard, the little boy, was born
from my second marriage.

512
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,693
Now I only have memories.

513
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,440
And pleasure I can get from these.

514
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:58,285
One of the few advantages I can get
from being the wife of an ambassador.

515
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:03,790
No police, no search warrant, nothing.

516
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,331
Poor Mr Norton.

517
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:09,045
I hope you haven't bothered him
too much, Mummy.

518
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,041
Not a bit of it. Your mother
has been delightful company.

519
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,169
Another lie.

520
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,216
You know, Helen,

521
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,591
this gentleman,
he's quite... quite charming.

522
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,934
He's a <i>charmeur.</i>

523
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:27,102
- Where did you find him?
- Between one corpse and another.

524
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,605
<i>Oh, mon dieu!
Quelle façon de causer.</i>

525
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,568
What a horrible thing to say!

526
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,437
Well, I think I...

527
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,903
Well, it was very nice
to chat with you.

528
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,027
- Yes, thank you. Goodbye.
- Hope to see you soon.

529
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,369
<i>À bientôt.</i>

530
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,072
This friend of yours
is rather becoming a pain in the arse.

531
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:24,488
I don't know why you're talking like that.
He's such a charming man.

532
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,082
And not at all... boring.

533
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,415
I'm beginning to get
a little worried about you.

534
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,013
You know, what little mind you had
has been eaten up by those drugs.

535
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,850
You are going too far,
Excellency <i>de merde.</i>

536
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,516
I'm merely trying
to lower myself to your level.

537
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,390
I am there at the place
where I picked you up,

538
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,936
remember?

539
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,655
<i>Mon chou,</i> how can I forget it?

540
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,025
It's one of the most lovely
<i>souvenirs</i> of my life.

541
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,704
But I don't know
what you are bragging about.

542
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,825
You only got to this rank just because
you've been bowing and scraping

543
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,371
to one minister after another.

544
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,495
How dare you speak to me like that?

545
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,341
You can order your servants around
or your whores.

546
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,343
And from now on
you can go out with them

547
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,385
to your boring reception
and your official appearances.

548
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:31,104
- Do you want me to break your neck?
- Don't try to raise one finger to me.

549
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:42,525
Ah, you have no idea
how far I can go.

550
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,410
You bitch.

551
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,707
You fucking bitch!

552
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,377
You bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

553
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,510
Your place?
Fabulous. What time?

554
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,345
Yes, five. See you then.

555
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:13,480
Well, then, I fixed the party for tonight.
Sort of an all-male affair.

556
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,894
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can count me out.

557
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,609
I have a date with Helen
and I don't want to lose her.

558
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,737
Count me out too.

559
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:24,612
I have something else on myself
for tonight.

560
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,199
You can't!
I've arranged everything.

561
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,495
Ah, come on, Jerry.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

562
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,208
- You can't just...?
- Oh, no?

563
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,077
Why should we do what you want?

564
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,795
You take it easy.

565
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,916
Don't try pushing me too far. I warn you,
it wouldn't take much before I...

566
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,509
Oh, what a roar!

567
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,629
Well, lion, what would you do?

568
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,256
Tell me, or shall I knock your face in?

569
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,603
John, why don't you come with me
to Switzerland?

570
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,095
It's out of the question.
Will you tell me something, Helen?

571
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,532
Did you know your father was having
an affair with that girl found in the car?

572
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,446
No, of course not.

573
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:52,241
He was going
with the one in the club too.

574
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,659
What I'm saying doesn't seem
to astonish you a bit.

575
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,205
- Now, why is that?
- Why should it astonish me?

576
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,670
My father has always been a collector.
He happens to collect women.

577
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,461
Now, why all these questions,
Inspector Norton?

578
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,753
- You know who I am?
- I have known from the start,

579
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,880
ever since that evening
you drove me home.

580
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,849
My father recognized you.
Then Walter confirmed it.

581
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,436
I see. So that's why
he called you into the library

582
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,679
and you had that argument.

583
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,149
I don't remember having an argument
with my father that evening.

584
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:25,108
Then I'd say you had an unusual way
of conversing.

585
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,982
Well, it's true, Father,
that is stepfather,

586
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,359
can be a little original
in his behavior at times.

587
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,454
But he's just like that.
It's not important.

588
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,291
But tell me,
why did you leave the police?

589
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,954
I'd rather not go into it.

590
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,038
What is the matter?

591
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,474
- Can't say I care for that customer.
- Oh?

592
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,977
What do the papers say?

593
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:33,777
Oh, there's a lot of speculation
on Sobiesky's role in this affair.

594
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,904
The usual things
to arouse readers' interest.

595
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,531
They're only agreed on one thing.

596
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,284
That we are incompetent
and inefficient.

597
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,411
- Hello, Joe.
- Norton.

598
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,959
Will you give me a pint
of the black stuff?

599
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,804
We've got something
that's been waiting for you.

600
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,014
You have?

601
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,142
Letter.

602
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,771
My precious pussy.

603
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,649
You go down to the kitchen
and have some food.

604
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,026
That's right, my pussy.

605
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,654
Go on, down you go.

606
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,781
That's my puss.

607
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,009
Who's there?

608
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,932
It's me, Mother.

609
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,619
Is this your razor?

610
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,665
Yes, it's mine.

611
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,775
I thought I might shave
the old way again for a while

612
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,382
but I found out I was a bit wobbly.
You see?

613
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,056
I see there's been a new murder.

614
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,680
And I suppose
you already know who did it.

615
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,650
And I suppose your suspicions
are on the ambassador's wife

616
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,020
because you found her lighter
at the scene of the crime.

617
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,646
But you're not listening!

618
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,616
Oh, for crying out loud!
Of course I'm listening, go on.

619
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,029
No, no, no!

620
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,574
A criminal on this level
would never be so stupid

621
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,540
as to leave such obvious clues behind.

622
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,829
Somebody has done that
to fool the police.

623
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,629
That shows the murderer
is an intelligent person,

624
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,839
even if a bit infantile.

625
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,207
If you've never read anything
but the story of Tom Thumb,

626
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,965
you must know that.

627
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,337
So? Go on.

628
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,556
The murderer is the little boy.

629
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,892
The little monster. Believe me.

630
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,388
Hi, Granny. Hello, Daddy.

631
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,392
I'm going to the kitchen.
I'm hungry.

632
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,774
Erin, what is it?

633
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:25,602
- Er, Miss Sobiesky, please.
- If you go through there,

634
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,605
you'll find the young lady in the bar,
first door on the right.

635
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,356
Have you got a pen and paper?

636
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,617
Thank you.

637
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,047
Would you perhaps be kind enough
to see that this reaches her?

638
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,665
Of course.

639
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,177
Her boyfriends
even follow her out here!

640
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,391
What a surprise.

641
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,353
I could of... missed you,
you know?

642
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,062
A bad sign, hmm?

643
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,101
By the way, who are
those two fellas you were with?

644
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,819
You're jealous, huh?

645
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,609
Could be.

646
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,280
One is my brother Marc
and the other one is a friend of his.

647
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,409
I was hoping to have a word
with your father.

648
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,282
Is it very urgent?

649
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,954
More or less.

650
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,999
You'll find him over at the bobsleds.
He spends all his time there.

651
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,263
Uh, there's my father's bobsled.

652
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,200
Oh!

653
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,796
Do you mind if I sit down?

654
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,048
Please.

655
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,888
I'm fully aware of the reason
for your visit.

656
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:24,054
And I can assure that I intend to take
full advantage of my diplomatic immunity

657
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,312
to refuse any further comment
on an unfortunate incident

658
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,856
or in any of the others
which followed it.

659
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,733
Now, if that is quite clear, Norton,

660
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,944
then maybe I can offer you a drink.

661
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,991
Or a cigar.

662
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,789
Thanks.

663
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,624
Would you believe I flew
all the way to Switzerland

664
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,466
for the purpose of finding out
what brand of cigar you smoke?

665
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,334
And now you know.

666
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,429
- There was something else.
- I thought we had finished.

667
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,266
It seems I was expecting too much
from a policeman.

668
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,641
Are you aware
that your bobsled was sabotaged?

669
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,110
Somebody was trying to kill you.

670
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,026
Oh well, that's really very good news.

671
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,778
I thought it was my fault.

672
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,031
Well, in any case,

673
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:28,375
you send your report
to the federal police.

674
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,753
Um, why don't you stay on
another day or two?

675
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,629
No, I have to get back.

676
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:43,052
Why didn't you tell me
you'd rented that place in Dalkey?

677
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,390
I rented nothing in Dalkey.
Are you out of your mind?

678
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:51,516
Listen, the time is long past
when I used to enjoy solving riddles.

679
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:58,360
So if you're hiding something from me,
it's better for you that you tell me now.

680
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,609
But I swear to you,
I don't even know where Dalkey is.

681
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,862
It took a while
but I tracked down the solicitor

682
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,331
for the woman
who owns the house.

683
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,825
I saw the lease.
It had your name on it, Helen,

684
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,793
in nice clear letters.

685
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,040
Some of your dresses were hanging
in the bedroom closet.

686
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,167
And one other thing.

687
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,137
There was a guest in the house
when I got there.

688
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,755
A very dead one.

689
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,633
And he wasn't in the closet, though.
He was in your bed.

690
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,604
Look, if this is a joke,
it's in very bad taste.

691
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,894
No, it's no joke.

692
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,940
The dead house guest
was your old pal, Walter.

693
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,778
You haven't forgotten him too,
have you?

694
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,943
How horrible.

695
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,282
It's terrible.

696
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,530
I can't believe it.

697
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,824
It can't be true.

698
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,452
It's true, Helen.

699
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,329
They're all facts, like the fact
I also found a lighter in the room.

700
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,547
A very special one,
a Cartier lighter.

701
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,506
Then there's the fact that...

702
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,595
that Walter's body
was covered with flowers.

703
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:06,716
I've no idea why,
possibly to hide the ugly gash across...

704
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,385
...across the poor devil's throat.

705
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,761
Now will you tell me the truth?

706
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,559
I've told you the truth already.

707
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,525
I don't know what you're talking about.

708
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:21,318
It's all so shocking, so awful, and...

709
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,033
...and after all you've just told me,
you found my mother's lighter.

710
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,950
If that's true, why didn't you
immediately go to her,

711
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:32,291
instead of torturing me
with these silly accusations?

712
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:37,372
That's just what I'm going to do
the minute I arrive back in Dublin.

713
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,214
I want that killer,
and embassy or no embassy, I'll get him.

714
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,786
- Good day.
- Something terrible has happened.

715
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,221
Thank goodness you're here, sir.

716
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,937
Madam was trying to kill herself
in the... in the bathroom.

717
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,035
She is still alive.
Will you call an ambulance?

718
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,120
Mandel.

719
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,670
Inspector.

720
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:49,671
I was waiting for you.
I want to speak with you.

721
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,132
Have a beer?

722
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,110
The ambassador didn't need you
any longer?

723
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,068
So you know too?

724
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,566
Almost three weeks ago

725
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,535
he said with my conjunctivitis
I couldn't drive anymore.

726
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,199
Mmm-hmm?

727
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,994
Only, he has to pay me
what he owes me.

728
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:23,211
He thinks he can take advantage of me
because he's a diplomat on foreign soil.

729
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,831
But he doesn't know the likes of me.

730
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:30,553
I will knock his block off
even if they put me inside for it!

731
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,262
And...

732
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,302
That fucking bastard!

733
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,387
And why didn't they give you
a month's notice?

734
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,439
I... I don't know.

735
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,106
It was twenty days ago.

736
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,729
That's why I'm sitting here,

737
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,528
free as the air and without a penny
in my pocket, you know?

738
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,573
Twenty days ago...
That'd be right after the murder, then?

739
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,573
Yes...

740
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,702
Yes, you are right,
now that I think of it.

741
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,250
- You smoke?
- Uh-uh.

742
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,424
No, I don't.

743
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,726
Oh... they got broken
when I got off the bus.

744
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:26,601
Some bastard gave me a shove,
you know?

745
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,695
Uh, I heard the crack
but I didn't take any notice at the time

746
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:30,903
and, uh, when...

747
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,325
- When are you pulling out?
- Why?

748
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,694
Nothing.

749
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,698
I might just want to have another word
with you, you never know.

750
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,955
I'm sorry you're broke, you know?

751
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,708
I'll take these with me
and have them fixed.

752
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,213
Why did you do it?

753
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,219
I...

754
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:40,512
I didn't try to commit suicide.

755
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:47,018
Someone tried to kill me.

756
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,183
Who?

757
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,480
Who was it?

758
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,125
I'm sorry, sir,
but you'd better go now.

759
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,796
Well, then, Hobbs, what's your opinion?

760
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,764
There's no doubt about it, Inspector.

761
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,475
This piece came from those glasses.

762
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,560
Very well, you can go now.

763
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,606
Mmm...

764
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,646
You don't seem sure.

765
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,565
What doesn't fit in
according to you?

766
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:37,360
I don't know. It just doesn't fit.

767
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,906
We'll discuss your misgivings later.

768
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,414
This is Jack Mandel's address.
Bring him here.

769
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,291
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go on.

770
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,885
All right, what is it that doesn't fit in
according to you?

771
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,513
Does it surprise you that a murderer
should leave such obvious clues?

772
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,140
Lawrence, if you had a mother
like my mother

773
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,108
you'd know what it means
to have misgivings.

774
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:18,318
We just have to wait for a few minutes
and then we'll know the answer.

775
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,066
Hello? Inspector Norton, please.

776
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:58,312
Yes, put him through.
It's for you.

777
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,071
- 'Hello? Inspector Norton?'
- Yes, go ahead.

778
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,162
- 'Listen, I went to get my money.'
- It's Mandel.

779
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:08,580
I heard Mrs Sobiesky shouting
and if I hadn't come in at that moment,

780
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,324
she would have ended up
like the other victims.

781
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:16,584
No! I saw the person
who was trying to kill her.

782
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:17,922
Yeah.

783
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,042
'I cannot tell you who it was because...

784
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,089
'because I'm scared, you understand?

785
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,304
'But it was not me, right?'

786
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,889
Yes, I know that, for God's sake.
Who was it?

787
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,431
I... I'm sure you've already got
an idea about who it is

788
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,724
since from the beginning...

789
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:34,269
Argh! No!

790
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,982
Mandel!

791
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,232
Mandel!

792
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,251
Just a moment.

793
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,754
I'm not deaf!

794
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,294
I'm coming.

795
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,985
The lady wants to talk to Mr Norton.
I said he wasn't in, but...

796
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,354
I'm Helen Sobiesky,
I'm a friend of your son.

797
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,151
I know everything about you.

798
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,696
- Everything?
- Yes.

799
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:29,911
- May I come in and wait for him?
- Of course.

800
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,780
Now, thank you, Guard.

801
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,949
Thank you.

802
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,962
I seem such a prisoner
with these policemen

803
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,505
but my son wanted it.

804
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:48,051
He said we're safer
but it's such a bore.

805
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,674
- Will he be very late?
- Oh, I don't think so.

806
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,641
But please sit down.
I'll get you some coffee.

807
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,262
- Do you like coffee?
- Yes, but don't bother.

808
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,389
It's no bother.

809
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,775
Here you are, Miss Sobiesky.

810
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,157
You must think I'm terribly rude

811
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,497
but John has talked so much
about you and Erin...

812
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,661
That's his daughter's name, I believe?

813
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,785
...that I felt a desire to see his home.

814
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,253
You're a woman. I'm sure
you understand my curiosity.

815
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,543
Of course I understand,
but don't worry.

816
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,667
- Come and have some coffee.
- Thank you.

817
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,343
No, two, five.
Yes, thank you.

818
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:17,844
Mmm-hmm.

819
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,525
Hello?
Who do you want to speak to?

820
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:33,072
Hello? This is Inspector Norton
calling from Dublin.

821
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,370
I want to speak
to Mr Marc Sobiesky.

822
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,575
I'll go and see if he's in.

823
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,380
- Who is it?
- Shh.

824
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,881
I'm sorry, Mr Sobiesky is out.

825
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,656
If you leave your number,
I'll have him call you when he gets back.

826
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,517
No, don't bother.

827
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:39,634
You're very kind, but I'm afraid
I can't wait any longer.

828
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,059
Please excuse me, and would you
tell your son that I'll call him later?

829
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,022
Of course I will.

830
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,312
And I do hope
you'll come again very soon.

831
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,901
Thank you, I will.

832
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,861
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

833
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,974
You frightened the life out of me.

834
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,318
When will you learn
that if you don't wear your glasses

835
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,108
you can't hear anything?

836
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,232
Somebody could come in and kill you
like they did the cat.

837
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,859
With that policeman out there
that's not possible.

838
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,157
- Well, you could bolt the door.
- What?

839
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,951
You could bolt the door!

840
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,333
Taxi.

841
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,082
Taxi, over here!

842
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,671
Taxi!

843
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:55,919
Oh!

844
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,351
Help!

845
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,517
Help me, somebody!

846
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,239
Help!

847
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,876
Help!

848
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,849
Help!

849
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,227
Help!

850
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,938
Help me!

851
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,608
Help!

852
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,417
Help!

853
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,346
Help!

854
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,831
Do you think we...
we should inform the police?

855
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,799
There's time for that later.

856
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,589
Right now
we don't know what it was.

857
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,713
An accident?
Attempted murder?

858
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,465
Maybe she wanted to kill herself.
The only thing we do know

859
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,594
is that you fished her out of the river
in a state of shock.

860
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,855
Do you think
she's one of them junkies?

861
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,474
Maybe.

862
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,979
But it's strange.
She has some bruises on her forearm.

863
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,606
I don't know exactly
what caused them.

864
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:24,826
For the moment, the only thing to do
is to let her sleep.

865
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,884
It's all clear now.

866
01:25:58,487 --> 01:25:59,978
Oh...

867
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,647
Oh, dear.

868
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:14,167
Are you using his sun lamp again?
Well, I hope it isn't your father.

869
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,050
Oh, too stiff these bolts.

870
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,850
Ah, Helen, my dear!
Do come in.

871
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:46,282
My son isn't here, but this time
I won't let you go till he comes back.

872
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:49,824
And this time you must have
a cup of my excellent coffee.

873
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:54,370
Please, sit down.
I'll just put the kettle on.

874
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,906
Oh, dear, I should have put on
a saucepan instead of a kettle,

875
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,626
but it's too late to worry.

876
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,362
Help! Granny!

877
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,733
Help!

878
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,876
Granny!

879
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,837
No! Let me go!

880
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:30,882
Granny, help!
Help! Granny!

881
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,182
Help me, Granny!

882
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,782
Granny! Help me!

883
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,705
What are you...?

884
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:21,186
- Hello, William.
- Huh?

885
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,234
I'll be in for the rest of the night.
You can go.

886
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,437
That's very good of you, sir.
Thanks.

887
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,020
Anything new in the papers?

888
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:31,317
There's nothing
the politicians won't solve, sir.

889
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,065
Good night.

890
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,626
Daddy! Help!

891
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,593
Erin!

892
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,925
- Erin...
- She's got Granny!

893
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,227
Helen. Helen!

894
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:11,899
You're crazy!

895
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,740
You're...

896
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,117
You're her brother!
For God's sake!

897
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:21,285
I'll kill you like all the others!

898
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,972
I'll kill you!

899
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,455
Mother!

900
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,877
Daddy!

901
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,091
Look out!

902
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:56,728
Marc had always
been perverted, sick.

903
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,816
He hated us.

904
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,905
Oh, I think he hated everyone

905
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:04,573
whom he thought was
happy, beautiful, lucky.

906
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:07,989
Yes, he really tried to destroy us.

907
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,333
He tried to make us look responsible.

908
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:13,623
All those murders.

909
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:17,965
Mandel, the chauffeur, found out the truth
and was trying to blackmail him.

910
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,710
Well, the rest you know.

911
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,587
Anyway,

912
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,635
my career is quite over.

913
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,761
At least, I shall have time
to try and forget.

914
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:39,403
And what's happened
with Helen?

915
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,864
She's in Paris. She'll join us later.

916
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,827
Anyway, I hope so.

917
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:07,173
It's all a bit pathetic, isn't it?

918
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,641
You'd have put the handcuffs on him
quick enough.

919
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,101
Yes, because...

920
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,435
...it was he who killed the girl
they found in the car.

921
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:18,651
That was what touched off
Marc's wild spree.

922
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,610
Why didn't you tell me this before?

923
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,229
It would have been useless.

924
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,573
You wouldn't have been able
to do anything.

925
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,034
Anyway, when he arrives back
in his own country

926
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,495
he'll be in
for an unpleasant surprise.

927
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:32,535
He won't have
his diplomatic immunity then.

928
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,829
And this time,
he won't screw the police.

929
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:36,452
I'm for a drink.
