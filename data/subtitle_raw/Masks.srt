1
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,592
APPLAUSE

2
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,395
So Gustave, that went quite well!

3
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,950
I'm overwhelmed...

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,711
That song brings back so many
memories... But you were wonderful!

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,029
And now, number "8"!

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,477
And isn't she pretty?
Now, what's your name?

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,999
Show our friends how pretty you are!

8
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,190
She's so moved...
Even a bit scared... But don't be,

9
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,231
our friends are so kind!

10
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,393
<i>Now, what have you chosen?</i>

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>"White Hands"...</i>

12
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,315
<i>A pretty song,</i>
<i>a shame it's been forgotten!</i>

13
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,353
<i>Move up to the microphone.</i>
<i>A wonderful choice</i>

14
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,269
<i>I leave you now with Emilie</i>
<i>and her "White Hands"...</i>

15
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
I'm awful there,
with that charming Emilie.

16
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,994
It's like I wanted
to look down at my watch...

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,713
I don't think so, sir.

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,593
A very sweet and charming moment...

19
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,076
In fact, I think I did want
to look at my watch!

20
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,478
That would surprise me.
Mr. Wolf has arrived.

21
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,549
Mr. Wolf? Let him in then!

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,670
This way, please...
Mr. Legagneur will see you now.

23
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,752
Colette, Mr. Wolf is doing me
the honor of writing my biography...

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,397
On the contrary, sir,
you're giving me the pleasure!

25
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,760
Call me Christian
or we won't get anywhere!

26
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,473
He also writes detective novels!

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,079
Under what name, was it?

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,157
Well, Roland Wolf!

29
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,877
Of course! It all gets so confused
in my poor head...

30
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,190
I guess you won't be back
this week?

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,278
You bet!
My head's about to explode!

32
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,153
- And Wednesday's show?
- I'm sure you'll manage.

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,759
And if I need to contact you?

34
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,315
Call Colette at the number
I gave you.

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,239
Well then, try to relax.

36
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,112
And you, try to work hard!

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,675
Tell me...

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,676
I was thinking...

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,953
I'm sure you were!

40
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,833
For your book,
the sooner would be the better.

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,036
Definitely!

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,470
How long do you need
to operate on me?

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,673
20 hours, I'm afraid...

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,359
Here's what I propose:

45
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,677
Thanks to the soccer championship,
I'm off this week.

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,598
I'll take you along
to the country.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,588
We'll be in paradise!
No phone calls, no pests...

48
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,438
Do you like the country?

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,553
I prefer traveling,
but the country's okay.

50
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,671
You can bring along
your girlfriend.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,839
- I haven't one at the moment.
- What more could the people want?

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,555
How about knocking one back?

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,399
I must say I hoped
for something like this.

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,550
I thought so.

55
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,671
You could've put it in the trunk!

56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,639
I thought it was full.

57
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,994
Is that true, Max?

58
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,077
By the way, Max is mute.

59
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,749
A serious illness...

60
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,591
A sort of tongue cancer,
with metastases’ in the ear...

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,553
They brought it to a stop,
right Max?

62
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,155
Here we are! And welcome!

63
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,119
Max, show Mr. Wolf to his room.

64
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,439
See you in a few minutes...

65
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,232
What is all this junk?

66
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,195
Madeleine...

67
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,629
My dear Roland...
Take a seat there, next to Patricia.

68
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,918
She's got a strong grip...
She's a masseuse. And a good one!

69
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,111
An in-house masseuse,
what a luxury!

70
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,995
- Good to have someone new beside me.
- She reads cards as well.

71
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,749
- Only for those I'm fond of.
- You've never read them for me!

72
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,520
Cut the nonsense
and pour us some wine.

73
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,193
My husband, Manuel Marquet.

74
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,188
Yes, pour us some wine.
He's an expert in red stuff!

75
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,914
I ordered Clos-Vougeot, Moulis...
Do you also want some Savigny?

76
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,475
You know you have
<i>carte blanche</i> here!

77
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,634
You're in charge?

78
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,592
Christian was kind enough...

79
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,917
I'm not kind,
I just rely on experts!

80
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,231
Good.

81
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,510
Good?

82
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,555
Very good.

83
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,596
Full-bodied, rich color,
lingering taste...

84
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,392
Keep it under control!

85
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,953
We must admit it's excellent.

86
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,714
It's quite good.

87
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,799
Pheasant terrine...
I hope you like game?

88
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,676
- The season's open?
- Those are Max's little secrets!

89
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,632
Better not dig any deeper.

90
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,912
How do you like his cap?
Isn't he handsome?

91
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
He loves wearing many hats.
Right, Max?

92
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,950
And Colette,
the best secretary I've ever had,

93
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,435
serves at the tables
with an apron on.

94
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,710
You seem surprised,
my dear Wolf...

95
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,191
- It's quite unusual.
- Indeed!

96
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,755
That's why they do it,
for the fun of it!

97
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,951
- Right, Colette?
- Absolutely, sir.

98
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,914
It's very amusing
to live several lives at one time!

99
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,395
Here you are, darling!

100
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,594
I'm late.

101
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,751
Catherine, my godchild...

102
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,039
Let me introduce you
to Roland Wolf...

103
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,713
He's the one writing the book
I told you about.

104
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,556
Forgive me for being late, sir.

105
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,431
Never mind.

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,834
Help yourself.

107
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,476
You eat like a bird!

108
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,839
Be a good girl.

109
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,031
- I put in the tablets.
- Very good.

110
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,152
Drink it while you eat.

111
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,389
Not too unpleasant?

112
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,589
It's all right.

113
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,550
No point restraining
your curiosity...

114
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,239
My goddaughter's been ill
for several months.

115
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,950
All this because
of a blasted quack

116
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,959
who came to cure her
of simple food poisoning

117
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,515
and gave her a prescription
so bizarre

118
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,594
that she was left paralyzed
for several days.

119
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,869
Not paralyzed!

120
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,395
You couldn't use your legs, pet!

121
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,988
But things are going better,

122
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,590
thanks to a light
though effective treatment

123
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,597
that Patricia helped me with.

124
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,155
Using only plants!

125
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,558
Unfortunately,
her eyes are still sore...

126
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,436
You know what?

127
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,312
I'll close the drapes.

128
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,358
I think I'm done for.

129
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,393
You're very good.

130
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,439
You too are good,

131
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,558
but it's true you're done for.

132
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,750
No one can beat you,
you know that.

133
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,430
Don't smother me with compliments,

134
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,035
and put down that knitting.

135
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,475
Don't worry,
I'm doing it mechanically.

136
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,678
You look tired, little girl...

137
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,949
I'm sleepy as well.

138
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,669
We're all sleepy.

139
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,794
One thing:
There’re no hangers in my room.

140
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,797
Max will straighten that out.

141
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,238
Oh, that idiot has gone to bed!

142
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,070
You look after it.
You know where the hangers are.

143
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,239
I'll bring the hangers
to your room, sir.

144
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,674
Are these enough?

145
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,556
Oh yes! I'm very neat,
but I don't have many clothes.

146
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,999
Well then, good night.

147
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,439
Why did you do that?

148
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,313
Because I love you!

149
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,519
I love your eyes.

150
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,108
Kiss me...

151
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,512
and look right at me!

152
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,996
Don't say anything
to my godfather.

153
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,277
He trusts me so!

154
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,271
He’s so afraid for me...

155
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,439
He's so kind...

156
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,509
My friend!

157
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,749
You slept well?

158
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,357
- Quite well.
- Sit down.

159
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,032
You're an early riser,
I like that.

160
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,878
It depends on the day.

161
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,277
Are you tea or coffee person?

162
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,879
I'll take tea, like you.

163
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,031
Would you like eggs?

164
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,629
- I'll take some toast.
- Help yourself.

165
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,558
What would you say
to a half-hour of jogging?

166
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,950
Frankly, it's not my cup of tea.

167
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,519
We'll get along just fine,
but you're wrong. It feels great.

168
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,678
You get rid of all
this filth inside...

169
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,116
It's almost a metaphysical exercise.

170
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,678
I must say I find it quite boring.
I'm more of a tennis person.

171
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,195
You're a snob!
But I'll put you up to it.

172
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,312
This is what I propose:

173
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,673
Can I speak informally to you?
I can't work any other way.

174
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,630
We’ll work for 2 short hours.

175
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,469
Then, Max will take me to Paris
for a business lunch...

176
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,594
I'll look after some things
for next week's program...

177
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,155
When I'm back,
we'll play a set or two.

178
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,636
- 2 hours isn't very long!
- We'll work more tomorrow.

179
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,876
Come on, let's get a move on!

180
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,028
From the start:

181
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,195
My father was a druggist.
He died when I was 12.

182
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,390
My mother was unable to work.

183
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,952
She never even thought of it!
She looked after the estate

184
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,549
as best as she could,
that is, not very well.

185
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,150
It was depleted very quickly.

186
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,550
How unpleasant it is
to slowly grow poor,

187
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,430
to sink into discomfort...

188
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,711
But in the end, I found that people
were generally quite kind...

189
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,433
Normally, people say the opposite.

190
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,310
We can only help those who have
the strength to fight.

191
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,514
Very enlightening!

192
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,836
I'm not an intellectual, you know.

193
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,550
With me,
everything's from the heart.

194
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,716
I chose this career,
or it chose me, I don't know...

195
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,029
because I like people,
no matter who they are.

196
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,676
When they come on stage

197
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,919
with their timid looks, their little
bouquets, their thin voices...

198
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,993
it's so emotional...

199
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,112
It brings tears to my eyes...

200
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,233
Sounds silly, right?

201
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,796
But you'll write it as the duty
of the powerful towards the weak.

202
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,352
I think I can manage that.

203
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,351
What's wrong, François?

204
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,233
The poor old girl!

205
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,991
She was wearing a sort of violet
perfume... Horrible! It reeked!

206
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,597
You're quite the actor,
aren't you?

207
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,633
Why? She was charming.

208
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,196
The fact is, I have allergies.

209
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,554
Not only to violets,
but to dust, mosquitoes,

210
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,830
feathers...
They're the worst!

211
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,235
Aren't allergies
rather psychosomatic?

212
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,193
That's what they say.
But also the contrary.

213
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,115
Be careful about
the mosquitoes here.

214
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,756
Did you get bitten last night?

215
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,599
Last night? No.

216
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,030
Because mosquitoes are dreadful!

217
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,517
The mosquitoes come from
the age of diplodocus...

218
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,995
The diplodocus disappeared,

219
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,872
but the mosquito survived!

220
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,469
- A beautiful metaphor.
- I love metaphors...

221
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,198
It's the most subtle and powerful
way of expressing complex ideas.

222
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,598
If you can decipher them...
If they are decipherable.

223
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,199
That's the problem!

224
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,194
Otherwise, there're just images,
which is already not half bad.

225
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,195
You're here, darling!
We didn't hear you...

226
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,315
You crept in like a little mouse!

227
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,359
- A little mosquito!
- I didn't mean to intrude.

228
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,199
Did you sleep well?

229
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,479
I've been up for a while.

230
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,474
What's this?

231
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,514
I made it.

232
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,233
It's baked clay.

233
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,552
Baked? Where?

234
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,509
In the kitchen.

235
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,669
In the oven.

236
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,156
You could've burnt yourself!

237
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,552
You need a special oven
that has safety devices!

238
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,791
It's absurd! So much effort!

239
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,434
So what? You weren't happy.

240
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,835
Why, yes I was, Catherine!

241
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,473
The poor child...

242
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,993
I do everything I can
to help her recover.

243
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,751
She starts getting better,
and then has a relapse...

244
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,470
Wasn't it just her nerves?

245
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,796
She has no reason to be nervous!

246
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,877
I consider her as my daughter.

247
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,911
Her parents died when she was 5

248
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,557
in a tragic car accident...

249
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,115
We can't even glue it back together!

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,112
They were my best friends.
They were killed instantly.

251
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,596
Since she had no one
and I was her godfather,

252
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,199
I took her in,

253
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,918
and grew fond of her.

254
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,836
The love for children, you know,

255
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,589
it's crazy...

256
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,077
it eats you alive!

257
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,438
They're the real ogres!

258
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,317
Can you ring Colette?
Near the chimney...

259
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,993
She's like a daughter to me...
And she worries me.

260
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,310
I don't really know what to do.

261
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,634
- Why don't you call a doctor?
- No.

262
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,989
They're the ones
that made her like this!

263
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,589
Colette, can you take this away?

264
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,312
Catherine made it,
then broke it.

265
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,514
The poor girl!
I saw her run crying to her room.

266
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,393
Look after her. Try to console her.

267
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,035
I must go now. Where's Max?

268
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,637
I'll be back soon.
Don't get too bored without me!

269
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,355
- I'll be transcribing.
- And as soon as I return...

270
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,549
Madeleine...

271
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,033
Rummaging, are we?

272
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,919
Mr. Legagneur has challenged
me to a match.

273
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,990
If you accepted, you're crazy.
Here’ll beat you.

274
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,319
I play well, you know.

275
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,633
At least, not bad.

276
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,756
He brats everybody.
At every game. He's a monster.

277
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,031
He didn't beat Madeleine, did he?

278
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,594
You know Madeleine?

279
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,677
Not at all,
he spoke of her to me.

280
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,033
She was a true champion,
but he must've beat her

281
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,639
a couple of times.

282
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,996
And what happened
to little Madeleine?

283
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,393
She left one day, like that,
without any fanfare.

284
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,148
She went to the Seychelles.

285
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,594
She left a note for Christian.
I think he was quite hurt.

286
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,078
But he's so kind,
he made excuses for her.

287
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,353
When'll you do my cards?

288
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,508
Whenever you want.

289
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,278
But I'd rather do other things...

290
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,113
Come on, Patricia...

291
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,750
What do you expect?
I'm a masseuse, first of all!

292
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,353
I bet you can't guess
the origin of this wine...

293
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,313
I wouldn't even dare.

294
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,151
A salad comes after...
Will that be enough?

295
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,236
Certainly!

296
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,556
Light lunches are healthier.

297
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,428
That's debatable!

298
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,153
Look at you!
As fat as a monk!

299
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,274
Shall I serve you?

300
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,549
With pleasure!

301
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,279
And the wine, Mr. Wolf?

302
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,713
Excellent! But I couldn't tell you
where it's from.

303
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,552
Of course, it's from Australia!

304
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,194
Catherine isn't eating?

305
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,194
No, she's in her room.

306
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,279
Her godfather wants her to rest.

307
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,119
I'll bring her something later.

308
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,996
Mr. Wolf

309
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,918
found Madeleine's racquet...

310
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,594
Little Madeleine...

311
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,078
You know Madeleine?

312
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,279
Not at all. Who's she?

313
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,990
A young girl...
A friend of Catherine.

314
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,437
Mr. Legagneur invited her here
for his godchild.

315
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,597
She wanted to be an actress...

316
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,237
She left one night
without a word.

317
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,953
She was a bit flighty...

318
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,473
She doesn't have a family?

319
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,394
I don't know.
You should ask Mr. Legagneur.

320
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,239
Some salad?

321
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,875
Please.

322
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,751
May I take over Mr. Legagneur's
office, this afternoon?

323
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,114
Or course, that was planned.

324
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,838
<i>A little silly, right?</i>

325
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,194
<i>But you'll write it as the duty of</i>
<i>the powerful towards the weak...</i>

326
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,958
<i>I think I can manage that.</i>

327
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,559
<i>You like to play the cynic...</i>
<i>Young people like to be cynical.</i>

328
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,954
<i>But be careful:</i>

329
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,233
<i>In the end, I can learn as much</i>
<i>about you, as you about me</i>

330
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,078
<i>Maybe.</i>
<i>But I've nothing to hide.</i>

331
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,829
<i>Me neither.</i>
<i>And that's what makes my strength...</i>

332
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,395
<i>my sentiments, my emotions,</i>
<i>my naivety, even...</i>

333
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,272
<i>I accept all that.</i>

334
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,870
<i>I'm not flattering myself,</i>
<i>I'm just happy to be that way.</i>

335
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,759
<i>You're a happy man?</i>

336
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,594
<i>I feel good.</i>

337
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,756
<i>I feel well-balanced...</i>

338
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,431
<i>I'd like everyone around me</i>
<i>to feel the same.</i>

339
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,755
<i>You should jog, Roland.</i>

340
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,109
<i>You'd breathe deeply,</i>
<i>rid yourself of the filth inside...</i>

341
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,429
<i>Know St. Paul's epistles to Timothy?</i>

342
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,789
<i>Slightly.</i>

343
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,839
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>I'm not the church-going type.</i>

344
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,993
<i>Catechism was a nightmare for me</i>

345
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,431
<i>Even as kids,</i>
<i>we thought it was a bore...</i>

346
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,914
<i>But St. Paul, that's something else!</i>

347
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,712
<i>It's completely modern</i>

348
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,875
<i>What he says about understanding</i>
<i>truth, for instance,</i>

349
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,160
<i>is extraordinary!</i>
<i>What I want you to understand,</i>

350
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,715
<i>because it's the key to everything,</i>

351
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,115
<i>is that I love my work passionately.</i>

352
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,677
<i>Don't worry, I'm not saying</i>
<i>it's a religion to me</i>

353
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,511
<i>but frankly, it's almost that!</i>

354
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,391
<i>I feel so strong...</i>

355
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,432
St. Paul to Timothy...

356
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,112
"Let the woman be in silence
with all subjection..."

357
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,557
<i>and they seem so weak to me...</i>

358
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,437
<i>All my shows are taped. I'll play</i>
<i>one for you, so you'll understand.</i>

359
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,190
- So, did you work well?
- Not bad.

360
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,674
I worked in your office.

361
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,271
Good move! It's a comfortable room,
I like it very much.

362
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,875
Are things starting to take shape?

363
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,798
Yes, things are taking shape.

364
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,909
Excuse me,

365
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,758
but may I have a word with you?

366
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,439
Go ahead, my dear friend!

367
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,868
It's confidential.

368
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,555
Well then,
let's speak in confidence!

369
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,869
You did well.

370
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,594
Let her sleep,
I'll take care of it tonight.

371
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,430
And our match?
No backing out, now!

372
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,998
- Dammit!
- 30/40.

373
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,868
I'm going to lose,

374
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,117
but the match isn't even.
I was a regular pig at lunch!

375
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,151
I think you're letting me win!

376
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,714
You guessed right.

377
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,919
You owe me another set.

378
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,636
I owe you nothing, but I accept.

379
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,388
I'm worn out!

380
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,793
You must be ranked,
you cagey devil!

381
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,194
You're not so bad yourself!

382
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,391
Oh come on, I was heavy!

383
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,077
I was using Madeline’s racquet...

384
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,869
Madeleine's?

385
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,795
"M.C."...

386
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,150
Yes, it's Madeleine's racquet.

387
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,237
I thought she took it with her.

388
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,396
- Who told you about her?
- Patricia.

389
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,876
We came here before lunch.

390
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,878
You're fooling around with her?
Be careful,

391
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,114
- she's a man-eater!
- So it appears...

392
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,471
And just who is this Madeleine?

393
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,514
One of those girls
who want into showbiz.

394
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,314
She followed me around
for a month...

395
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,552
Like a regular groupie!

396
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,072
I thought she'd make
a good friend for Catherine.

397
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,313
She was quite charming...
Even quite pretty.

398
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,549
I invited her here for Easter,
but she stayed 3 months.

399
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,434
Shall we go in?

400
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,831
- No relatives?
- How should I know?

401
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,513
She never mentioned any.

402
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,799
And I never asked.

403
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,629
Why did she leave?

404
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,230
She left an odd note saying
she was going on a trip.

405
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,636
Patricia said, to the Seychelles.

406
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,948
My old-timers win trips there,
she must've dreamt about it, too.

407
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,390
- And Catherine?
- She said nothing.

408
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,876
But why are you so interested?

409
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,833
I'm just intrigued
by young people's behavior.

410
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,029
Indeed!

411
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,909
- May I ask you how old you are?
- 27.

412
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,953
I'm also intrigued
by young people's behavior.

413
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,068
Did you beat him?

414
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,232
I can't stay long.

415
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,518
What did you do all day?

416
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,395
I slept.

417
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,634
Colette told me
he wanted me to sleep.

418
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,159
Were you tired?

419
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,153
I don't know...
My eyes and legs were sore.

420
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,995
I like you.

421
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,112
I wanted to see you,
but I was afraid I'd hurt him.

422
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,072
Fear the image of God...

423
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,473
It's a very common
and dangerous image...

424
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,793
I don't understand.

425
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,393
Did you like Madeleine?

426
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,159
How do you know her?

427
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,512
I don't. I'm just asking.

428
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,718
I hated her.
She was mean and deceitful.

429
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,034
- She returned evil for good.
- What do you mean?

430
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,070
I don't want to talk about her.
I was glad she left.

431
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,395
I must go.

432
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,070
No!

433
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,909
Another time.

434
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,595
May I?

435
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,432
Show me your knees.

436
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,916
Do you have problems walking,
these days?

437
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,518
It depends.
In the evening, sometimes.

438
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,790
Don't be so upset, my pet!

439
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,271
Colette will bring you your medicine.

440
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,632
Don't send me to the hospital!

441
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,990
Have I ever sent you there?

442
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,109
I know you like that young man
very much. Don't say a word!

443
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,038
I was young once, myself.

444
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,796
I know that the feeling of love

445
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,195
is like a wave
that's hard to stop...

446
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,032
But the problem is that Wolf
is just having fun.

447
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,717
For him, women are only toys.

448
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,959
He takes one,

449
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,354
then another...

450
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,190
Toys are broken easily.

451
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,869
Especially by careless people.

452
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,958
Remember Madeleine...

453
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,432
You're not a toy.

454
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,396
I don't want you to be broken.

455
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,869
Everything's all right?

456
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,395
Quite fine!

457
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,115
There now...

458
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,394
Sleep tight.

459
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,632
We'll look after you.

460
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,152
They mustn't see each other!

461
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,158
We can stop them during the day,
but at night?

462
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,793
Double her dose!

463
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,556
Why were those tires in my trunk?

464
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,672
It's scrap.
Max wiII go to Aïda in 2 days.

465
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,429
Really bright!

466
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,120
Put your hands down,
for the energy.

467
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,960
Put your hands down,
for the energy.

468
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,632
So, you've taken over
my territory?

469
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,513
Are you going to be long?
I'd like for

470
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,032
Mr. Wolf and I to work a bit,
if you don't mind.

471
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,878
Not at all! We'll continue later.

472
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,797
No problem.

473
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,752
Calling him by his first name?

474
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,791
Mr. Wolf asked me to.

475
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,760
He knows how to talk to women,
that one!

476
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,315
Roland, be kind and pass me a cigar.

477
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,358
There's none left.

478
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,315
Manu's work again, right Patricia?

479
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,996
There must be some in my drawer.

480
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,714
You know now
why I have them locked up.

481
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,148
Will you give me a little massage?
I'm sore.

482
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,588
With pleasure.

483
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,839
No, the small gold one.

484
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,679
- Take one, if you want.
- Never in the morning.

485
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,279
I'll go get my recorder.

486
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,274
That feels good!

487
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,754
That's wonderful...

488
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,028
Thank you, dear.

489
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,394
That reminds me of my youth,
when I sang...

490
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,036
We had sessions
with an old Chinese masseur.

491
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,433
He had extraordinary hands...

492
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,909
You sang?

493
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,314
Years ago!

494
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,349
I don't have good memories of it.
But we must be honest, right?

495
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,118
Did you sleep well, last night?

496
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,675
Not bad.
A few mosquitoes... And you?

497
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,838
I cut myself off:
Eyes covered, ears plugged...

498
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,951
Takes a lot to wake me up.

499
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,991
Why did you stop singing?

500
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,869
Allergies... They’re awful!

501
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,956
They destroy the voice
in 2 weeks! Horrible!

502
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,792
Just the thought of it and
I'm in a cold sweat. After 25 years!

503
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,039
It's hard to sneeze for your supper!

504
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
- What a cruel way to put it!
- Sorry.

505
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,273
- I'd kill my sister for a good pun.
- How awful!

506
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,036
Be kind enough to leave us
to our work.

507
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,993
Your charm can only distract us!

508
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,149
Isn't she amusing?

509
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,715
Stop that for a couple of minutes,
would you?

510
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,236
You didn't ask about Catherine...

511
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,272
How is she today?

512
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,239
Still tired.
Colette's looking after her.

513
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,678
Without meaning to,
you've upset her a bit.

514
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,154
Me, upset her?

515
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,710
She's very fragile.
And she's lonely.

516
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,114
I know she went
to your room last night.

517
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,275
- It was all quite innocent!
- What did she want?

518
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,471
To see someone, I think.
To stretch out her legs...

519
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,278
She only stayed two minutes.

520
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,874
I must ask you to not see her today.

521
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,275
I'm not trying to.

522
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,836
And keep the balcony door shut.
For the mosquitoes!

523
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,829
No problem.

524
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,831
- Shall we begin?
- Of course.

525
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,274
By the way...

526
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,512
Yesterday, Catherine spoke
to me about Madeleine...

527
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,273
What did she say?

528
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,399
She was very odd...
really violent...

529
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,878
She told me she hated her.

530
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,038
That may be it.

531
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,990
They were inseparable
for 3 months...

532
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,879
What're you doing here?

533
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,516
They sent me out.
It seems they're working!

534
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,792
Sure thing!
I'm the one who's working here!

535
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,877
You're not complaining, are you?

536
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,317
I'm not. I'm not ungrateful.

537
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,232
But I'd like
that journalist to go!

538
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,470
Yrs...
Something doesn't feel right.

539
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,877
He seems to be looking
for something...

540
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,718
Something specific...

541
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,589
Like what?

542
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,029
I don't know.

543
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,914
It's too precise.

544
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,595
"Miss Catherine Lecoeur..."

545
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,559
"Miss Catherine Lecoeur

546
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,478

547
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,673
"Legagneur and Lecoeur.

552
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,319
She's a minor!

Okay, I get it now.

You scared me!

566
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,433
Sorry. I wanted some aspirin,
I've got a splitting headache.

567
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,918
Come along, I'll get you some.

568
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,518
It's Bluebeard's den here!

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,713
Mr. Legagneur collects them.
How many?

571
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,957
Two.

572
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,475
A sleeping pill?

573
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,910
No thanks, I don't take them.

574
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,034
You're welcome.

575
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,590
Don't make a sound.
I'm returning your visit.

576
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,552
- Go away, I'm tired.
- Don't you love me?

577
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,431
Go away!

578
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,039
I've things to tell you.

579
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,800
I don't want to hear them.
Let me sleep.

580
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,916
In fact,
I'm going to wake you up!

581
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,556
You didn't tell me you were rich.

582
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,793
I said, you <i>were</i>,
because you no longer are!

583
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,991
Your dear godfather
robbed you blind.

584
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,155
Sometimes the truth can make
you dizzy.

585
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,874
He took you under his wing
for your money.

586
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,753
He diverted your funds,
bought companies

587
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,838
from a scrap yard
to an old folk's home.

588
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,878
A little soft shoe,
then he robs them!

589
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,479
I don't believe you.

590
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,118
Your eyes look like a liar's.
Let me sleep.

591
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,038
All this before you reach
your majority... Of course!

592
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,674
He's been good
and generous all his life.

593
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,149
- You must stop taking that medicine.
- Shut up!

594
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,432
What are you doing here?

595
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,233
She fainted. Call a doctor!

596
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,910
Go and get Mr. Legagneur.
No, I'll go. You stay here.

597
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,193
- What's happening?
- We heard a scream...

598
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,277
It's nothing. Go back to bed.

599
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,197
Did she scream?

600
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,590
Can we help?

601
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,518
- Call a doctor.
- I'll do it.

602
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,314
There'll be no doctor
in this house!

603
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,429
Sorry, but they're the ones
who put her in this state.

604
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,475
She's much better now,
thanks to Patricia and myself.

605
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,716
- I was trying to help.
- I know,

606
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,840
but things are more complicated
than you think.

607
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,350
It'll pass. This isn't
the first time, unfortunately.

608
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,028
- She should sniff vinegar.
- It's no use...

609
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,839
She's burning hot...

610
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,917
You can all go back to bed.

611
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,639
I'll stay with Wolf.
You don't mind, do you?

612
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,795
Not at all.

613
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,718
Call if you need anything.

614
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,989
Thank you, my friends.

615
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,272
Catherine, wake up, my child...

616
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,233
My little pet...

617
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,952
How did you get in?

618
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,229
She let out a terrible scream...
She fainted in my arms.

619
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,598
She must've had a nightmare.

620
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,878
There she is...

621
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,472
Go to sleep now.

622
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,799
You can go now.
Thank you for your help.

623
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,831
Please... It was only natural.

624
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,193
Will you sleep now?

625
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,514
And now, my dear friends...

626
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,513
we’ll find out which
of the charming finalists

627
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,639
have won the wonderful voyage
to Polynesia...

628
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,628
15 days in heavenly locations...
1st class all the way!

629
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,592
An unforgettable vacation

630
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,236
that I'm so happy to present!

631
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,672
Attention!
The score for each couple

632
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,155
will now appear on the board!

633
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,478
Control room,

634
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,791
let's have it!

635
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,154
Couple number 1...

636
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,108
56 points...

637
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,960
Couple number 2: 54...

638
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,594
Couple number 3: 51...

639
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,917
Couple number 4: 62...

640
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,154
Couple number 5: 55...

641
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,794
And, here we go...
couple number 6...

642
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,113
Here we go!

643
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,796
59 points!

644
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,955
So, it's

645
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,675
couple number 4 who wins
the trip to Polynesia!

646
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,235
So I'll ask Rosette and Maurice

647
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,359
to come and join me.

648
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,595
<i>This envelope holds</i>
<i>your happiness...</i>

649
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,755
<i>Who'll take it?</i>

650
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,154
They're so cute!

651
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,477
<i>- She holds the purse strings...</i>
- <i>With my best wishes, Rosette!</i>

652
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,959
<i>Thank you Christian</i>
<i>Let me give you a kiss.</i>

653
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,431
He shows such kindness!

654
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,199
You like him very much.

655
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,318
I'd be ungracious not to!
He's so good to us.

656
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,270
I'm sure.

657
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,511
What a night!
So, shall we play the game?

658
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,234
Christian will interrupt us once again

659
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,272
No, he's with Catherine.

660
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,431
He's so worried about her.

661
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,839
You look much better.
You're less pale.

662
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,196
- Right, Colette?
- Without a doubt.

663
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,510
You faint too often, my dear.

664
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,712
You're much too emotional.

665
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,431
- I wasn't like this before.
- You must've had a nightmare.

666
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,232
Tell me about it.

667
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,399
I don't remember.

668
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,188
I hope the journalist hasn't
planted ideas in your head?

669
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,108
Don't cry.

670
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,793
Come on now, don't cry, my child.

671
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,034
Men have lots of imagination,
you know.

672
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,199
Especially when it comes
to seducing girls.

673
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,079
I'd like to go out.

674
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,195
I must get up, wake myself up.

675
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,550
Of course!
You're not a prisoner.

676
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,638
I'll prepare your clothes.
You can take a walk.

677
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,838
You'll succeed in your undertakings,
but they won't earn money.

678
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,998
What a waste of time!

679
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,231
However, I see money...

680
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,279
You've reassured me.

681
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,718
There will be problems...

682
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,429
You go from hot to cold, don't you?

683
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,517
That's strange...
Your cards are good,

684
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,390
but they fall in an odd pattern...

685
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,879
I'll have
to make the best of it.

686
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,871
But, if you want, you could have
an interesting affair...

687
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,912
It's not so bad, after all!

688
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,078
But you'll have to make
the first move!

689
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,869
Am I intruding?

690
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,069
We've just finished.

691
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,430
Did she promise you good things?

692
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,437
- Not bad.
- I'd say, so-so.

693
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,359
I've got some news
that'll make you happy...

694
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,630
Catherine’s much better
this morning.

695
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,799
- You must be very glad!
- I must say I'm relieved.

696
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,116
Take a look out the window...

697
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,156
I suppose you want to work?

698
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,319
A resurrection, isn't it?

699
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,357
You see, no need for a doctor.

700
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,470
You're right.

701
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,114
Listen, I'm hungry...

702
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,518
I'm going to <i>brunch</i>,
as the Anglo-Saxons say...

703
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,631
So, why don't you join her?

704
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,034
I'm sure she'll thank you
for last night.

705
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,356
I'll call you when I'm finished.

706
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,120
And don't whisper sweet nothings
in her ear!

707
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,438
Thank you for last night.

708
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,510
Good! You've learnt
your lesson by heart.

709
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,271
Your godfather sent me to you.

710
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,310
We're his puppets...
Like his old folks.

711
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,829
If you've come to torture me,
go away.

712
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,635
No, to open your eyes
and make you see the danger!

713
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,638
He's so sure of himself,

714
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,877
he thinks anything I say
will turn you more against me.

715
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,116
I'm just asking you to listen.

716
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,912
Don't be so familiar with me!

717
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,678
You approached me first!

718
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,474
Why'd you start hating
Madeleine Chevalier?

719
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,280
You loved her,
and suddenly you hated her!

720
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,951
She said the same things as me?

721
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,074
She realized
your godfather had a scheme...

722
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,794
After your fortunes,
he’ll take your life!

723
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,036
You didn't believe her, did you?

724
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,111
And you started hating her!

725
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,275
You told Legagneur.
He laughed his hearty laugh

726
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,788
and said Madeleine was crazy,
bitter...

727
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,508
And unbalanced!

728
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,715
The proof: One day,
she left without even a goodbye.

729
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,393
She didn't leave!

730
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,478
He made away with her,
one way or another.

731
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,830
Like he might make away with you.

732
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,677
He thought she had no family
to worry about her.

733
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,748
Roland Wolf isn't my name,
it's a pseudonym.

734
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,430
And the book on Legagneur
is a pretext. I came for Madeleine.

735
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,030
I'm in your hands.
Do what you want.

736
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,834
Come on, old fellow,
let's get to work.

737
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,596
There's not much time left.

738
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,393
Are you all right, Catherine?

739
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,995
I'm all right.

740
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,918
I'm stealing Wolf from you.

741
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,595
- You're looking great!
- You, too!

742
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,358
I came to get a piece of bread.

743
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,835
Hungry, huh?
Do you want some jam?

744
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,393
No, I don't like jam.

745
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,950
I saw you left the garden...

746
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,150
You’re throwing him out?
Don't you like him anymore?

747
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,836
I was afraid it'd scare him.

748
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,751
Are you crazy?

749
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,753
Please understand,
I can't stand feathers!

750
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,393
I was allergic to them.

751
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,148
I almost lost my voice...
I almost died!

752
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,029
Look at me...

753
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,595
Allergies are very dangerous.

754
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,157
It was the bird, or me.

755
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,468
Do you understand?

756
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,795
Understand?

757
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,315
Yes, I do.

758
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,788
I heard you come in.
I was waiting.

759
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,314
What's the matter?

760
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,471
- You woke me up.
- Really?

761
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,908
I'm sorry.

762
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,717
I was asleep for too long.

763
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,950
But your eyes entered mine,
I see clearly now.

764
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,556
He killed an injured bird,

765
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,354
just like its life meant nothing...

766
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,190
No more than any other life!

767
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,835
Do you believe me now?
Do you trust me?

768
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,713
Yes. Take me with you. Let's go.

769
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,392
He's got every power to bring
you back, and he'd use them!

770
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,273
He'd call the police.

771
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,551
Just tell him what you told me!

772
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,829
There's no "just" here!

773
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,037
His notoriety protects him.

774
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,439
Publicly, he's the best of men,
oozing goodness, charity...

775
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,999
I have no proof.

776
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,158
He'd laugh with a twinge of sadness
in front of so much meanness.

777
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,552
I'll find some other way.

778
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,678
It's you that doesn't trust me!

779
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,356
Don't say that!

780
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,993
I know it's true!

781
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,512
It's because
I didn't believe Madeleine.

782
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,438
You couldn't believe her.

783
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,519
You were blinded.

784
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,869
Still,

785
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,153
I feel guilty.

786
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,429
She was my friend...
So kind to me...

787
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,998
Suddenly, I started hating her.
I didn't want to believe her.

788
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,234
She might've had many faults,
but she never lied.

789
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,830
When I told godfather,
my anguish nearly choked me.

790
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,268
It's all my fault.

791
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,155
No, you were in darkness,
you couldn't see the light.

792
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,070
Think of yourself now. Forget
the past, live in the present.

793
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,391
Tell me I'm not ugly...

794
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,069
He put that idea in your head,
as well?

795
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,558
In his own way.

796
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,552
He'd say I was pretty,

797
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,474
but I shouldn't believe
those who'd say I wasn't.

798
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,668
He's really the most incredible
son-of-a-bitch!

799
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,913
It'll be a tight game.
Think there's a chance?

800
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,034
Ask me.

801
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,719
Can you do it?

802
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,070
Yes,

803
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,838
I want to be all yours.

804
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,154
You won't be mine, nor his...
You're your own person.

805
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,912
But I'm giving myself to you...

806
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,793
Are you awake?

807
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,634
Did you sleep well?

808
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,354
Yes, thanks.
I feel great this morning.

809
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,956
Mr. Legagneur will be glad.

810
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,753
Drink while it's hot.

811
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,313
I'm hungry...

812
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,431
Will you get me some toast?

813
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,109
Certainly!

814
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,108
I thought maybe you'd like
a little jam...

815
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,871
I don't like sugary things.

816
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,394
Some more tea?

817
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,950
You're so kind to look after me...

818
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,149
- Happiness is a good appetite!
- Quite true!

819
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,351
I'll miss your breakfasts.

820
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,110
The weather's so fine
I went around the park.

821
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,356
- Jogging?
- No, I took a stroll.

822
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,119
Tell me, old fellow...

823
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,073
Time's passed quickly, but tomorrow,
it's back to the rat race!

824
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,392
I'm taping
"Happiness for Everyone".

825
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,592
You're cordially invited,
if you want.

826
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,355
I'd like to.

827
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,719
I'm very glad.

828
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,275
Usually, intellectuals despise

829
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,914
- these shows.
- Not in my case!

830
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,118
Anyway, you've made me understand
their interest.

831
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,359
Your book wiII be good...
You have everything you need for it.

832
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,278
I think I've got all I need.

833
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,598
And there's still today.

834
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,115
Look who's coming...

835
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,475
My dear, be careful of your eyes,
it's very bright.

836
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,432
I've decided to get used to it.

837
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,436
I've decided to shake myself up.

838
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,234
You're very pretty...

839
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,679
May I ask you something?

840
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,388
Anything you want!

841
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,278
I'd like my checkbook.

842
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,751
I want to go shopping in Paris.

843
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,315
Are you sure you feel strong enough?

844
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,556
What do you think, Roland?

845
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,398
I don't want to interfere.

846
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,950
- Does that annoy you?
- Of course not!

847
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,277
I'm happy to see
you're feeling better.

848
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,835
I'm just afraid
you'll tire yourself.

849
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,834
Well, all right. I'll ask Max

850
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,354
to get the car ready,
and drive you there.

851
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,760
Don't get carried away!
Enjoy yourself.

852
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,953
Watch your coat...

853
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,073
What's going on?

854
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,475
The battery?

855
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,755
The ignition?

856
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,629
Go check!

857
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,918
It's ridiculous, Max...

858
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,398
I'm not at all happy!

859
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,948
Sorry, Catherine...

860
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,754
- You must be disappointed...
- It doesn't matter.

861
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,473
I'll go next time.

862
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,351
Get it fixed! And quickly!

863
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,999
This isn't good!

864
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,356
Catherine,
put on your glasses, my girl...

865
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,514
The sun's so strong!

866
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,349
"The sun enlightens the sky",
like the song says.

867
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,358
- You changed your mind?
- The car's broken down.

868
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,915
That great car? What bad luck!

869
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,314
You said it.

870
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,515
"Tomorrow, the motor will hum...

871
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,912
"The lights will brighten up
the dark hillsides"...

872
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,554
My dear Roland,
your culture dazzles me!

873
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,595
Now, to work!

874
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,915
You're all right?

875
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,200
There's one thing
you must emphasize:

876
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,988
The difficulty to stir up
the public.

877
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,313
That's important.

878
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,158
Catherine’s transformed!

879
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,508
She's sunbathing.

880
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,075
Sunbathing?

881
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,439
She's not thinking!

882
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,959
She's mad!
What's gotten over her?

883
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,719
Excuse me for a moment...

884
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,918
Don't lie under the sun like that.

885
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,430
It's not good,
it's even dangerous, I told you so.

886
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,074
- But it feels healthy!
- Listen, my little girl,

887
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,192
I'm not used
to giving ultimatums...

888
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,469
Either go into the shade,
or go to your room!

889
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,839
It bothers you that I'm better.

890
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,318
Don't be silly,
but don't lie out like that.

891
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,030
That's right, go inside.

892
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,519
For God's sake!

893
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,070
Mr. Legagneur isn't here?

894
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,398
He'll be back right away.

895
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,719
Wonderful, isn't it?

896
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,514
Mr. Legagneur loves beautiful books.

897
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,031
He loves all beautiful things.

898
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,195
Here he is!

899
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,753
Be kind and accompany Catherine
to her room.

900
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,399
I can go alone.

901
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,797
The studio called. You're needed
there at 11 tomorrow.

902
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,958
As if I didn't know!
They're extraordinary!

903
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,839
So, it's the final push?

904
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,874
In a sense.

905
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,629
My keys, then.

906
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,871
Don't take a sip, it's corked!

907
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,351
Don't take a sip, it's corked!

908
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,551
Bring another bottle, then.

909
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,398
The first time this happened!

910
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,318
You should've tried it!

911
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,272
He tries them enough as it is!

912
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,712
The vacation's over.
Tomorrow, it's the rat race.

913
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,478
But you love it!

914
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,352
That's true, but these 3 days
have been very pleasant.

915
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,028
- This one's good.
- I'll get some other glasses.

916
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,629
The roast looks overcooked, Max.

917
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,874
Look at that... It's like leather.
Inedible!

918
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,918
It's not your day, Maxime.

919
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,515
We should make shepherd's pie.

920
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,948
That's an idea.

921
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,752
That'll take 3 hours.

922
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,394
We can't wait 3 hours!

923
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,273
Make it tonight,
and let's have sandwiches.

924
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,877
Will that be all right with you?

925
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,832
Good idea... That's just fine.

926
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,912
Colette, go get Maxime.

927
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,834
- Hr's making the fruit salad.
- That can wait,

928
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,190
I want him now.

929
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,158
So Wolfie,

930
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,512
feeling downhearted?

931
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,029
Thanks to everyone,
it hasn't felt like work.

932
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,834
Your work has only just begun!

933
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,673
Mr. Max, it's my great pleasure
to raise a glass in your honor!

934
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,670
With this admirable shrpherd's pie
from a frightful roast,

935
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,795
you've given us a lesson
in turning defeat into victory!

936
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,592
Long live Maxime!

937
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,158
You're a brave little soldier,
I'm proud of you.

938
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,917
Why?

939
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,714
You've decided to battle
your illness.

940
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,433
The best way to recover!

941
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,358
- Will you help me?
- Of course!

942
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,632
I'm going to bed, I'm tired.

943
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,560
I must get up early
for Mr. Wolf's departure.

944
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,036
Say goodbye now,
in case he leaves earlier.

945
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,468
Right, that'd be wise.

946
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,113
There're taxis at the station.

947
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,594
Well, in that case...

948
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,798
Glad to have met you...

949
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,798
Me, too. I hope you get well soon.

950
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,718
I'm on the way, now.

951
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,078
If your godfather permits me,
I'll give you a kiss.

952
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,191
Go right ahead, my old fellow!

953
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,636
A little formal, aren't we?

954
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,352
I'II leave you with Manu
and Patricia for a moment,

955
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,710
in Patricia's experienced hands!

956
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,559
I've something
to look after with Colette.

957
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,513
I'll join you in a minute
in the library.

958
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,757
Be kind enough to wait,
I've something to ask you.

959
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,238
Turn on the TV,
the soccer final's on tonight, alas!

960
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,869
I say "alas", but actually
I'm happy I'm going back.

961
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,159
Come on Colette, to my room!
All my papers are there.

962
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,150
Manu, have one of my cigars!

963
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,788
It's getting tense.

964
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,837
That lousy bastard!

965
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,312
We looked after him, right?

966
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,156
I don't know.

967
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,429
Better to make certain.

968
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,115
We only have to do
the same thing as before.

969
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:02,957
Impossible.

970
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,119
I don't see why.

971
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,311
Tell him! He gets on my nerves.

972
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,353
Christian means that
this guy has ties.

973
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,869
It's different than a runaway
with no one.

974
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,717
His disappearance
would create a fuss.

975
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,548
Let's "suicide" him.

976
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,636
Too risky!

977
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,074
Catherine's just as dangerous.

978
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,316
- I can't control her.
- Me neither.

979
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,039
She's playing around with me.

980
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,399
It's hard to admit it,
but it's true.

981
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,198
Anyway, it had to happen.

982
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,590
She's the one we'll take care of.

983
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,314
You scared me!

984
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,029
Did I?

985
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,394
What's going on?

986
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,508
You're packing?

987
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,673
You want to leave me?

988
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,800
I suppose you want
to leave with Wolf?

989
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,438
You're in love with him?

990
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,388
Look at that...

991
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,711
her little chin is trembling...

992
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,396
You think I'm going to scold you...

993
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,836
You think I won't understand?

994
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,598
You love Wolf? All right!

995
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,268
Okay! It's the best I can say.

996
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,269
Do you want some money?

997
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,349
Here...

998
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,879
To buy a few dresses...

999
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,550
This bag's in a state!
Colette will help you with it.

1000
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,398
Never mind.

1001
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,839
You must go to the station...
Colette will help...

1002
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,359
And Max, too.

1003
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,397
You already know the way!

1004
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,032
You can't do that to me!

1005
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,516
I'm not doing anything,
you're the one that's going.

1006
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,352
Take the back staircase.

1007
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,114
Too bad you can't come with us.
We'll visit wine caves...

1008
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,073
They uncork
such extraordinary wines...

1009
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,954
It'll last 15 days, 15 great days!

1010
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,434
Leave him alone.

1011
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,597
No, it's very interesting.

1012
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,993
Was I too long?

1013
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,153
You didn't exactly take
the smallest one!

1014
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,997
You're not watching the match?

1015
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,879
Patricia didn't want to.

1016
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,117
When the French don't play,
it doesn't interest me.

1017
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,356
I'd rather watch your show.

1018
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,832
I never could stand watching myself.

1019
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,590
Are you all right?

1020
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,631
She's as light as a feather.

1021
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,478
Excuse me,
but I've to go early tomorrow.

1022
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,353
I'll go, too.
You always wake me in the morning.

1023
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,515
Are you coming?

1024
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,395
Stay, Roland...
I've something to ask you.

1025
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,109
In case I don't see you tomorrow,
here's a kiss.

1026
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,838
Thanks for telling my fortune.

1027
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,989
If you change your mind,
I leave at 8.

1028
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,399
It's silly,
I wanted to play chess!

1029
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,871
For the pleasure of beating me.

1030
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,669
I accept.

1031
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,070
- But under one condition.
- Go ahead.

1032
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,437
Tell me why you change
the way you address me.

1033
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,110
Good question! It's simple:

1034
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,993
Friendship is of the heart,
reasoning demands distance.

1035
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,760
It's either sentimental,
or social...

1036
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,550
- Is that good enough?
- Interesting...

1037
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,632
- Right, or left?
- Right.

1038
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,435
You lose.

1039
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,391
One can win with the black.

1040
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,989
Help me.

1041
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,434
Are you coming?

1042
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,033
Shut up and drive.

1043
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,196
I must confess something,
Christian...

1044
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,595
May I?

1045
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,758
It won't disturb you?

1046
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,718
"Wolf" is a pseudonym.

1047
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,717
My real name is Roland Chevalier.

1048
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,631
Madeleine was my little sister.

1049
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,912
Well, what do you know!

1050
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,399
Don't you believe me?

1051
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,909
Impossible.

1052
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,030
She always hated traveling.

1053
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,598
She only wanted to be an actress.

1054
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,670
She wouldn't waste her time
in the Seychelles.

1055
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,958
Hollywood, perhaps.

1056
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,629
She didn't mention
Hollywood in her note.

1057
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,556
All I know is that
she disappeared.

1058
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,638
What do you want me to say?

1059
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,879
Tell me: "how much".

1060
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,594
I don't get it.

1061
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,999
Tell me "how much".

1062
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,433
You want me to say "how much"?

1063
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,751
How much?

1064
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,555
But Catherine's yours,
my old fellow.

1065
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,588
Didn't you notice?

1066
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,035
Catherine...

1067
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,716
and the money.

1068
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,392
Grooms are demanding these days!

1069
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,796
I'd sell my soul
for the Impressionists.

1070
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,909
Who's there?

1071
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,599
It's me, forget it.

1072
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,678
- Want a beer?
- No time!

1073
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,151
Ask Totor to look after
the Cadillac in the morning.

1074
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,631
The pink Cadillac? Okay.

1075
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,875
So?

1076
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,596
I thought
I was on the right track...

1077
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,912
Where did I make my mistake?

1078
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,190
You didn't make
any specific mistake.

1079
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,514
You were just
a little too optimistic...

1080
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,428
and you lost.

1081
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,158
Good night, old fellow. Sleep tight.

1082
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:34,597
My God!

1083
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,910
Totor will crush it at dawn.

1084
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,270
- Wake up, for God's Sake!
- Are you nuts, or what?

1085
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,358
You must help me,
Catherine's going to be killed!

1086
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,516
- How come?
- She's been kidnapped!

1087
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,757
Do you know
the scrap yard's address?

1088
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,757
Manu, wake up!

1089
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,595
Give him the scrap yard's address!

1090
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,513
Aïda 's scrap yard?

1091
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,918
I had some bottles
delivered there...

1092
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,196
- I'll come along.
- I can't wait!

1093
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,472
You're both angels.
Not a word to anyone.

1094
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,912
There's taxis at the station.

1095
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,155
I know.

1096
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,915
Totor!

1097
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,393
Max came by last night...
The pink Cadillac goes first.

1098
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,709
Sure, buddy...

1099
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,832
I'm with Max... Was he here?

1100
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,998
Yeah, for the Cadillac...
Totor's on it with the crane.

1101
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,550
Totor!

1102
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,154
Change of plans!
Forget the Cadillac.

1103
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,554
So, I let it go?

1104
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,836
No,

1105
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,995
put it down!

1106
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,274
Can't you make up your mind?

1107
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,318
What the hell are you doing?

1108
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,633
- Are you off your rocker?
- Help me open the trunk.

1109
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,829
There's someone in there!
Help me!

1110
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,029
The crowbar...

1111
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,389
Call an ambulance.

1112
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,835
Is she alive?

1113
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,715
Yes.

1114
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,028
Who's this chick?

1115
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,870
My wife, I think.

1116
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,034
Mrs. Lemonnier and Mr. Loury...

1117
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,233
who will perhaps soon be
Mr. And Mrs. Loury...

1118
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,269
Where are you from?

1119
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,670
I was a grocer
in Pontoise for 40 years.

1120
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,192
Now, I'm retired,
and I feel wonderful.

1121
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,229
I can understand!

1122
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,635
And you, Simone?
Simone, isn't it?

1123
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,030
I'm a grandmother,
and even a great-grandmother!

1124
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,878
Before, I was a laundress.

1125
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,914
A great-grandmother and a laundress,
do you believe that?

1126
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,352
How's it feel to be an engaged
great-grandmother?

1127
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,756
Her little chin is trembling...

1128
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,031
But she told her many children

1129
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,152
that she met
a fiancé thanks to this show.

1130
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,039
I certainly did,
and they're very happy.

1131
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,277
And I'm happy they're happy!

1132
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,153
But I can tell you,
they'll be jealous

1133
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,920
when they know what you've won.

1134
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,554
A trip...

1135
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,239
My God, it can't be!

1136
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:35,433
And not just any trip...
A trip around the world!

1137
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,392
That's what you've won,
a trip around the world!

1138
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:44,195
And now, a young couple will present
you with the tickets...

1139
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,799
And don't lose them!

1140
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:49,994
A young couple, waiting there
at the back of the studio...

1141
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,111
Our surprise guests!

1142
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,631
No need to tell you
everything has an end...

1143
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,200
Mr. Loury, I must confess
something to you.

1144
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,074
I don't like old age.
It frightens me.

1145
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,076
You shouldn't.

1146
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,999
Same with the public.
They disgust me.

1147
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,794
Deep down,
you know what I like? This!

1148
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,393
So, my golden-age fiancés,
isn't that wonderful?

1149
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,955
- Yes, it is!
- It's horrible!

1150
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,872
It's a total fraud!

1151
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,518
Because it deals with the heart.

1152
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,872
We make you believe
there's a little heart somewhere,

1153
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,357
and you eat it all up!

1154
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,356
Flaunting
what should remain private,

1155
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,074
the definition of obscenity!

1156
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,916
You couldn't know!
Anyway, it's not important.

1157
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,589
To think I've always loved
beautiful things...

1158
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,919
Why do we always do the opposite
of what we like?

1159
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,549
Maybe life forced you?

1160
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,154
Sure did!

1161
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,277
Life never forces anyone
to do garbage.

1162
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,630
No, it's something else.

1163
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,830
Something else...
I've always believed

1164
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,958
that life was a game,

1165
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,914
and that I was the manager
of the toy department.

1166
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:58,193
Problems backstage...
The risks of being live on air!

1167
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,710
Gentlemen, allow me to finish
the show in a blaze of glory!

1168
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,036
So...

1169
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,396
Wolf, what long teeth you have...

1170
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,155
You, knight at another's table...

1171
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,079
In the end, the black can win!

1172
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,718
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have only one thing left to say,

1173
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,191
from the bottom of my heart:

1174
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,752
Get fucked!
