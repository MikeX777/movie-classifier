1
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:29,539
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, honey. I'm at the hospital.</i>

2
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,871
Sorry for not answering your call earlier.

3
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:34,511
It's fine. I only wanted to tell you...

4
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,123
...that Dr. Rahma is sick,
so she can't attend to patients.

5
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:42,039
- <i>But they have another doctor.
</i>- What should we do then?

6
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,663
People recommended Dr. Rahma to us.

7
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:47,871
<i>We're already 10 days late.
We can't postpone our appointment any longer.</i>

8
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,931
Okay, then. As long as you feel comfortable.

9
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:53,499
- The doctor's young and good.
- A woman or a man?

10
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,163
A man, single, handsome.

11
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:59,135
That's not what I mean, honey.

12
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:03,495
I have no problem
if the doctor's a man or a woman as long as...

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,999
<i>I'm kidding. It's a woman.
I'm more comfortable with a woman anyway.</i>

14
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,078
I'll call you back later, okay?
Okay. Bye, love you.

15
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,707
- Nurse? Is the ob-gyn here yet?
- Yes, Ma'am?

16
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,623
Ob_gyn?

17
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,206
That's Dr. Cathalina.

18
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,415
Hannah?

19
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,999
Oh, dear! You're Hannah, right?

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,747
- I am.
- Oh dear. It's really you.

21
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:33,915
Han...

22
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:37,371
Don't you remember who I am?

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,955
I'm your high school friend, Han.

24
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,123
Cathy.

25
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:48,831
Cathy? Oh, dear! I didn't recognize you.

26
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,579
- You look so different.
- Do I?

27
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,915
Your hair was short back then.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,499
You're so pretty now, and you're an ob-gyn.

29
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,707
- Let's do your check-up then.
- You're going to do my check-up? Seriously?

30
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,623
What do you mean? You have doubts about me?

31
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,955
- Or do you want to cancel your appointment?
- Maybe I should.

32
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,999
Don't. I'm new here.

33
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,955
I'm kidding. I'm happy
that you're the one doing my check-up.

34
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:18,291
Hang on. Should I call you "Madame Doctor" here?

35
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:24,111
What are you talking about? Relax.
Call me Cathy or whatever, just like we used to.

36
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,503
I should call you "Meow" then.

37
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,331
About your problem,
the sickness and the dizziness...

38
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:37,331
That's due to your high blood pressure. 143/165.
I'm going to give you pills for that, okay?

39
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:42,707
But if you're still dizzy after that,
I'll refer you to an internist.

40
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,579
Okey dokey, Madame Doctor. Whatever you say.

41
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,662
By the way, are you married yet?

42
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:53,123
Please, we can only discuss medical issues
in this room, Mrs. Hannah.

43
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,663
Oops, sorry.

44
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,247
Let's start.

45
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,083
How's my baby?

46
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,539
- A boy?
- He is.

47
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,291
You must be so happy.

48
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:08,999
The fetus' weight is normal.

49
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,079
See? The placenta is also in the right place.
It's good.

50
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:16,999
And the fetus' head is near the birth canal.

51
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:23,414
The growth is slow, but we'll find out the cause.

52
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,871
Han, you don't need to worry. This is common.

53
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:35,371
It's usually because
the mother doesn't get enough nutrition.

54
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,415
Yes, Madame Doctor.

55
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,791
For me to eat a lot, I have one condition.

56
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:46,247
Madame Doctor must come and eat with me at my house.

57
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:50,623
This is the first time
I have a patient giving me a condition.

58
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:51,998
But you'll do it, won't you?

59
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,539
- Let me think about it first.
- Oh, dear. What a busy doctor.

60
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:58,622
Hey, your husband did not come with you?

61
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:03,747
He had a meeting.
But I think he's on his way here.

62
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:07,162
By the way, I don't know who your husband is.
Who is he?

63
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,791
We can only discuss medical issues in this room.

64
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:16,610
- Okay. You are using my own words against me?
- Who said that earlier?

65
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,914
Okay. Thank you, Sir.

66
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:42,287
- Hi!
- Hi!

67
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:46,955
Welcome! Finally, you're here!

68
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,954
Come in.

69
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:56,663
Han, you have such a nice house. Great ambiance.

70
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:59,207
Thank you. Let's go to the back
to meet my husband.

71
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,455
He's cooking us dinner. He won't let me get tired.

72
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:06,831
Here he is. Honey, here's my doctor.

73
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,914
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,291
Titi?

75
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:19,498
Malik?

76
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,326
Surprise!

77
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,415
- Happy? Are you happy now, Mrs. Hannah?
- I am.

78
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,707
No wonder she wouldn't mention
who her husband is. It's you.

79
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,623
Hannah didn't tell me either
that you're her doctor friend.

80
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:41,499
I did it on purpose.
I wanted to see your reactions.

81
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,622
You still love to play around, don't you?

82
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,123
Hang on. You guys talk.

83
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:53,623
Hannah? Where are you going?

84
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:55,706
Just a minute. Just chat a bit.

85
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,831
Do you know?

86
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:46,999
If I start to grumble and get angry,
he can't take it. And he would instantly say...

87
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,539
..."Honey, I married you because you're funny.

88
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:54,079
You're not funny anymore if you're angry."

89
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,539
Does he think I'm a comedian?
He married me just because I'm funny?

90
00:06:57,623 --> 00:07:01,623
It's not that, honey. But you make me happy.

91
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,791
Honey...

92
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,579
These kinds of things melt my heart.

93
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:09,331
But where did you meet again?

94
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:13,415
We met again in Jogja
because we were studying at the same university.

95
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,791
We were just friends back in high school.

96
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:20,371
But because Jogja has romantic vibes, so...

97
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:21,539
...the rest is history.

98
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:26,123
But who didn't like him back in high school?
Every girl had a crush on him.

99
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,538
Including you, right? You had a crush on him
back in high school, didn't you?

100
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,122
So cute.

101
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,791
Do you have a husband?

102
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,291
Not yet, honey.

103
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:50,207
Can't you see? A doctor, pretty, successful.
Guys are afraid of her.

104
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,999
It's not like that. You're exaggerating.

105
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,707
I just haven't met the right guy.

106
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,459
Your standard is too high.

107
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:01,762
What?

108
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,079
Excuse me, I need to get this.

109
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,290
Please.

110
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,707
Hello?

111
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,491
Yes?

112
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:20,999
What?

113
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,414
Mrs. Dewi?

114
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,791
Okay. I'll be there in a second.

115
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,623
Wait for me, okay?

116
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:37,079
Hannah, Malik, I'm sorry.
I need to go to the hospital for an emergency.

117
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:40,915
It's okay. You got here by taxi, didn't you?
Honey, take her.

118
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:46,707
- No, it's fine. I can go by taxi.
- No way. It's dark. The hospital's not far anyway.

119
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,955
It's okay. Let me take you. I'll get ready.

120
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,387
- Okay.
- But...

121
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,291
It's fine.

122
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,331
Han, you're okay with Malik taking me to the hospital?

123
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:59,079
It's okay. I trust you.

124
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,414
There's no way a woman like you would
want to be with another woman's husband.

125
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,755
Malik?

126
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,955
- Hey, Cath.
- You're still here?

127
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,791
I was waiting for you.

128
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,743
The weather is bad.
I will be worried if you took a cab.

129
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,371
But I have ordered one.

130
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:34,746
You can cancel it, right?

131
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:47,414
I still can't believe you're a doctor now
since you were afraid to see blood.

132
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,247
- Good evening, Uncle.
- Good evening.

133
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:56,747
Good evening, Aunty.

134
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:01,662
Mom, do you still remember him?

135
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,587
I'm Malik, Aunty, Uncle.

136
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,871
Oh, Malik! Oh dear!

137
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,454
Why are you here together?

138
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:18,499
I'll tell you later. He better go home now.
His wife is waiting for him back home.

139
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,791
Oh, you're married.

140
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,163
- Do you have any children?
- My wife's pregnant.

141
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,291
Here's the doctor.

142
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,791
Thank you for bringing Cathy home.

143
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,499
I'm leaving, Uncle, Aunty.

144
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,663
- Okay. Thanks.
- Aunty.

145
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:36,998
I'll drop him to his car.

146
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,915
Hey. Don't be nosy.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,162
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,247
Na?

149
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:11,862
Nana?

150
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,831
Na?

151
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:17,539
Nana? Oh, dear. Hannah!

152
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:20,415
Hannah?

153
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,539
Nana?

154
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:24,511
Na?

155
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,122
Oh, dear. Hannah?

156
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:37,791
- Hannah.
- Morning, Doctor.

157
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,998
How are you doing? Are you okay?

158
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,998
How do I look? I look fine, don't I?
Still looking pretty?

159
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,247
I'm fine, Cath.

160
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,247
They checked the baby last night.

161
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,791
Thank God, all is safe.

162
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:56,707
And what did Doctor Mulia say?

163
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,039
We're going to get a CT scan now.

164
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:04,079
- Okay.
- I have to be okay...

165
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:07,623
...so I don't die first and you remarry.

166
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,538
- What? What are you talking about?
- I won't allow it.

167
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,915
Enough. Let's go to the radiology.

168
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:18,539
- Excuse us.
- Can you accompany us? You can't?

169
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,663
- I can't.
- Stop it.

170
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:23,123
- But let me know the result.
- Okay.

171
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:26,123
- Okay, bye.
- I'll call you. Bye, Cath.

172
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,886
Are you okay?

173
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,294
I'm okay.

174
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,955
How did it feel
when you came to know Hannah's husband is Malik?

175
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,707
I bet you wanted to pull her hair.

176
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,499
Ra, you're overthinking.

177
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:52,623
Cathy isn't like that. Am I right?

178
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:56,371
See? She's silent. It means she agrees with me.

179
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,954
Cath, does your heart still hurt?

180
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,163
What should I say?

181
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,787
My heart's not hurting anymore. But...

182
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,579
...when I saw his face...

183
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,663
...I wanted to scratch his face.

184
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,303
See?

185
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,539
I'm with you.

186
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:20,663
- Do you still love him?
- What are you talking about? I'm only kidding.

187
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:24,455
- You're exaggerating.
- I don't love him anymore, okay?

188
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,163
Can we change the topic?
I'm sick of talking about this.

189
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,871
I'm not even thinking about it too much.

190
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:36,355
Okay. You say now you don't want to talk
or think about him.

191
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:43,247
But you know, deep down,
the names Malik and Hannah are in your mind.

192
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:47,746
That's the reason you haven't moved on yet.
You still want to be single, don't you?

193
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:52,871
Me being single right now...

194
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:55,291
...one thing for sure is
he's not the reason for it.

195
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,371
Because you haven't found a guy like Malik.

196
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:04,206
Guys, I have moved on. Okay?

197
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:15,830
How is it, Doc?

198
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:18,623
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,498
But I have to tell you this bad news.

200
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,930
The CT scan result shows...

201
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:29,370
...the presence of cancer.

202
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:42,499
Doctor, are you certain?
Any possibility of a mistake?

203
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,579
This is not what we hoped for.

204
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:50,290
The biopsy shows
that Mrs. Hannah has stage 3 brain cancer.

205
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,955
What should we do now, Doc?

206
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,747
Because you're pregnant,
you need to be handled with special treatment.

207
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,871
Chemo is the most suitable treatment.

208
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:05,078
I'll discuss it first with the ob-gyn.

209
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:12,831
I've read about it and found out...

210
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:20,039
...that chemo poses a high risk for the fetus.

211
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,791
So, I'm not going to do it.

212
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:25,998
Honey, if you're not going to do it,
It’s very risky for you.

213
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,207
If I do it...

214
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,499
...it's very risky for the baby.

215
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,998
And the most important thing now is my baby.

216
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,039
But if something happens to you,
it'll affect the baby.

217
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:44,163
I'm going to have the chemo
after my baby is born. End of story.

218
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,831
You have to be serious about it.
It's your life we're talking about.

219
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:51,831
I don't mind losing my life,
as long as my baby is born safely.

220
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,539
Oh, dear.

221
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:54,915
Honey, don't be stubborn.

222
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,415
- Just this time, don't be stubborn. Think about yourself.
- Don't you love your baby?

223
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,371
- I do.
- Hannah, Malik.

224
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,279
Stop it.

225
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,162
Don't get too emotional. Calm down.

226
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:10,955
The situation must be hard for both of you.

227
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,370
Han, as a patient, you have the right
to reject a medical procedure.

228
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,663
But you also need to understand...

229
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:22,747
...that a doctor's recommendation
is based on a patient's medical record.

230
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:27,871
That's why a patient and a doctor
need to be in agreement.

231
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,331
Then only can the medical procedure be done.

232
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:31,662
In your opinion...

233
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,331
...as a good friend...

234
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:36,791
...not as a doctor...

235
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,207
...what should we do?

236
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,875
As a good friend...

237
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,998
...I want you to get through
the medical procedure, Han.

238
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,870
For your own good.

239
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,714
Honey... Do it, okay?

240
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:11,098
Just leave.

241
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:13,331
- Bye.
- Bye.

242
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,747
- Mbok, take care of her. She's unwell.
- Yes, Sir.

243
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,454
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

244
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:30,207
My husband never kissed me when he left,
he kicked me instead.

245
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,623
Ma'am, what's wrong?

246
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,003
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

247
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,955
I'll call Mr. Malik
to take you to the doctor, okay?

248
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,871
No, he has just left.

249
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:44,455
You know, it's only because I'm pregnant.

250
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,954
I see. I was like that when I was pregnant.

251
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,455
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Dizzy and sick...

252
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,539
...of seeing my husband not have anything to do.

253
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,831
- Not that angle.
- How should I do it then?

254
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:02,415
- My face looks big. A bit lower.
- Oh, dear.

255
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,371
It's usually the photographer
that gives the direction, not the model.

256
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:08,707
Good evening.

257
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,122
- Aunty, Uncle.
- Erol.

258
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:15,039
How are you?
It's been a while since you came here.

259
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,455
- Good evening.
- Erol.

260
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,623
I just got back from a two-month trip around Europe.
For business.

261
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,291
- Amazing.
- With your dad?

262
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:25,663
With my dad.
But I handle a lot of Dad's business now.

263
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:27,747
Cool. That's how it should be.

264
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:31,207
Youngsters nowadays have to take part,
not be standing behind their parents.

265
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,623
- Give my regards to your dad.
- I will.

266
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,207
Let's drink some tea.
I made some great cookies.

267
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,079
Thank you, but not for me. I'm only picking Cathy up.
It's okay for me to take her out, isn't it?

268
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:45,123
Of course. Call your sister.

269
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,914
Big sister! Erol's here!

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,663
- Oh dear!
- Erol's here!

271
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,415
Don't scream. Go in and get her.

272
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,662
- That's not how you do it.
- Kids nowadays.

273
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,870
I could hear your loud voice all the way inside.

274
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,123
- Hi, Cath.
- Hi.

275
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,791
Mom, Dad, I'm leaving, okay?

276
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,663
Okay.

277
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,663
- So pretty.
- Cathy.

278
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,623
Don't come home too late at night. Okay?

279
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:18,954
And Erol? Take care of my daughter.
Bring her home in one piece.

280
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,039
For sure.

281
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,039
You're still joking.

282
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:23,663
- Aunty, Uncle.
- Yeah.

283
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,914
Bye.

284
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:33,123
The restaurant is great,
but why are there no other customers?

285
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,747
I booked it just for the two of us.

286
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,707
Rol, isn't this a bit too much?

287
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,870
No way. It's for you.

288
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:49,039
I also have ordered the food for you.
Is that okay?

289
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,830
It's okay. I trust your judgment.

290
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:55,662
When I was in Europe...

291
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,579
...Dad urged me to make a choice immediately.

292
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:03,791
He said I need to make a commitment
to a partner...

293
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,039
...before he gives his business to me.

294
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,871
Well...

295
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:15,986
...someone who is married
is usually more capable to make a commitment.

296
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,330
That's why I want to make a commitment to you.

297
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,623
I want us to not only be friends.

298
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,830
So, that's what your dad wants?

299
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,538
That's what I want too.

300
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:36,539
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing. I just want to laugh. Can't I?

301
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:37,623
So, what do you think?

302
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:40,454
So...

303
00:20:58,623 --> 00:20:59,662
No.

304
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:01,999
No?

305
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,331
Yes, no.

306
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:08,831
Please tell your dad sorry.

307
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:11,371
No problem. It's fine.

308
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:17,123
If I can be honest,
I'm more comfortable if we're friends.

309
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,207
Me, too. As long as you're comfortable, right?

310
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,315
Thank you.

311
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,379
Okay.

312
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:24,747
Thank you.

313
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,122
Let's eat.

314
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:34,746
Hello?

315
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:40,915
Okay. I'm on my way there. Hang on.

316
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:46,415
Rol, I'm so sorry. But I need to go to the hospital.
There's an emergency.

317
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:47,622
Okay, but eat first.

318
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,579
They can wait, can't they?

319
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,415
They can't.

320
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,207
Someone's life is in my hands.
I need to leave now.

321
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,622
You don't need to take me, I'll get a taxi.

322
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,747
Cathy, sorry for this.

323
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:18,623
It’s ok. It's my job. How's Hannah?

324
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:19,954
I don't know.

325
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,706
Doc, how's my wife?

326
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,999
There's no other way.
We need to deliver the baby now.

327
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,499
But with the patient's condition, it'll be risky.

328
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,707
Excuse me, Sir. Your wife's asking for you.

329
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,999
Okay.

330
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,454
- Doc...
- Please.

331
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,954
Doc, I'm sorry, but I...

332
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:45,663
I know.

333
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,207
You have an emotional attachment to the patient.

334
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,331
But if you mind,
another doctor can take your place.

335
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:53,039
But the surgery needs to be done soon.

336
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,371
At least one life will be saved.

337
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:00,207
Okay, Doc.

338
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,955
I'm ready, because there's no other option, isn't it?

339
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,407
I don't care what's going to happen to me anymore.

340
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,458
I need your help.

341
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,538
Save my baby, Cath.

342
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:22,719
Han...

343
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,915
...everything's going to be okay.

344
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,038
Okay?

345
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,870
I hope...

346
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,207
...I can die in peace.

347
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,662
I know I won't make it.

348
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:47,078
I'm sure you actually know it too.

349
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,415
Honey...

350
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:53,999
You'll be healthy again.

351
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,206
Got it?

352
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,959
Cathy, Malik...

353
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,806
...I know both of you
still have feelings for each other.

354
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,291
Han...

355
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:19,299
Han...

356
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,246
- Don't think bad thoughts about me.
- I'm not having bad thoughts.

357
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,954
For me, it's good.

358
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:33,626
I will be in peace and happy...

359
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:37,698
...if you get married.

360
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:48,635
Han, I'm sorry, but it's not funny.

361
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,039
Ti, sorry, Hannah's mind is down, so...

362
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,831
That's why she's talking nonsense.

363
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:58,891
I'm serious.

364
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,871
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- I'm serious.

365
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:07,406
Cath, I want my baby safe...

366
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:11,790
...and taken care of by someone right.

367
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,790
Malik is also a good husband.

368
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:23,946
I don't want him to marry the wrong woman.

369
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:28,831
Han...

370
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:34,790
You know I care so much about you.

371
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,602
But I'm sorry...

372
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,787
...I can't do what you are asking from me.

373
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,111
I can't.

374
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,354
You better rest now to calm your mind.

375
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,414
Ti, sorry...

376
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:28,371
Honey, what's wrong with you?

377
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:31,123
Stop it. Don't talk nonsense.

378
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,706
I never asked anything from you.

379
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:37,330
Only this.

380
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:54,579
I want my baby safe...

381
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:58,790
...and taken care of by someone right.

382
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,414
Malik is also a good husband.

383
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:09,998
I don't want him to marry the wrong woman.

384
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:22,079
You can ask anything you want.

385
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:24,331
But not that.

386
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,039
I don't want anything else.

387
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,538
Just that.

388
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:36,330
Ti.

389
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,290
I agree to do it.

390
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:53,915
Seriously, Cath?

391
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:56,871
Ti, let's talk.

392
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:59,206
Hey. What for?

393
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:01,830
She's ready to do it.

394
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:07,914
Honey, listen to me.
You're going to be healthy again.

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,955
I have a feeling.

396
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:13,498
And I'm sure it's going to come true.

397
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:21,150
Cath...

398
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,291
Say what I'm about to say.

399
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,578
In the name of Allah...

400
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:36,367
Honey, it's impossible. Okay?

401
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,623
Titi has a different belief from us.

402
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,914
Stop it.

403
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:45,746
I'm also a Muslim, Malik.

404
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,746
I should be able to do it.

405
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,914
You had to break up
because of your different beliefs.

406
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:14,162
But there's no more reason
for you to not be together.

407
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:17,407
Cath...

408
00:30:18,707 --> 00:30:20,078
Say what I'm about to say, okay?

409
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,954
In the name of Allah...

410
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:30,914
Cath...

411
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,578
In the name of Allah...

412
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:40,830
Come on, Cath. You promised me.

413
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,290
"In the name of Allah..."

414
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,623
In the name of Allah...

415
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,123
"I will...

416
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,110
...marry your husband."

417
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:05,039
Go on. Say it.

418
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:08,038
Cath.

419
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,415
If God permits it...

420
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:21,290
...I will marry...

421
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:31,914
...your husband.

422
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,123
Thank you.

423
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,454
You could always calm me down.

424
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:55,206
I want to see you get married before my surgery.

425
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,623
Han, it's impossible.

426
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:09,747
I'm willing and I will do it
if what you're worried about really happens.

427
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,291
But if not...

428
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,371
...I can't.

429
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:17,663
So how will I know
you're going to keep your promise...

430
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:20,706
...if I'm not here anymore?

431
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:26,955
Enough. It's not right.

432
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,371
Take back your request. Okay?

433
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,370
But Cathy has sworn.

434
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:37,078
This is the only thing that will keep me calm
during the surgery.

435
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:43,414
I'd like to be your marriage witness.

436
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:52,835
I think Hannah knows
that you only want to make her happy.

437
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,747
But don't you worry, okay?
Don't think about it.

438
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:00,623
Let me take care of this.
I'll talk to Hannah.

439
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,139
I'll try to make her understand. Okay?

440
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:07,414
Let's do it tomorrow.

441
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:10,550
What?

442
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:17,994
Let's get married tomorrow.

443
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,750
What are you doing this for, huh?

444
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:30,123
I don't want you to sacrifice your future
just because you pity me and Hannah.

445
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:31,998
We...

446
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:34,578
...are doing this...

447
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:37,455
...for Hannah.

448
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:39,914
That's the only reason?

449
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:43,162
What other reasons do you want?

450
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:48,579
Because...

451
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:52,163
Because I still love you?

452
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,791
Because when you left me...

453
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,747
...I felt lost and I still had hope
to get back with you again?

454
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,006
Is that what you mean?

455
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,378
I...

456
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,119
...have no feelings for you anymore.

457
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:16,227
And I'm going to marry you...

458
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,391
...just for Hannah...

459
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,539
...and the baby in her womb.

460
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:24,455
One more thing.

461
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,415
I didn't become a Muslim because of you.

462
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:30,954
I became a Muslim because I wanted to learn Islam.

463
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,122
And I learned about it when I studied in England.

464
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,895
We were broken up at that time.

465
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,539
So whatever my decision is...

466
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,663
...I am doing it all from my heart.

467
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:47,954
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

468
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,207
And I'm certain...

469
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,371
...Hannah...

470
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,830
... entrusted her kid to me...

471
00:34:57,955 --> 00:35:00,290
It's God's doing.

472
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,415
If you make that decision...

473
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,227
...then you're no longer my daughter.

474
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:30,522
Honey, think about what you are saying.

475
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:35,291
- So, you agree with this?
- I don't.

476
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:40,291
I don't agree to our daughter marrying a married man.

477
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:44,455
But Cathy will forever be our daughter.

478
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,999
A daughter who disappoints us...

479
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,455
...because she changed her belief
to chase Malik's love?

480
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:59,246
Mom, I became a Muslim not because of Malik.

481
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:05,123
I had broken up with him back then.

482
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,999
So, it had nothing to do with him.

483
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,915
Stop it. Don't say anything anymore.

484
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,830
This matter is clear.
We don't need to continue talking about this.

485
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,123
Mom...

486
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,830
Dad...

487
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:27,202
I'm sorry...

488
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:30,371
...for...

489
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:34,246
...always disappointing you.

490
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:41,586
But I have a reason for doing this.

491
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,038
Whatever your reason is, I don't get it!

492
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:58,139
We put you in school to be a smart woman!

493
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:00,247
And what's the result?

494
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,954
You're going to become someone's second wife.

495
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,746
What sect are you following?

496
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:33,026
So, can we start, Sir?

497
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:44,371
Yes.

498
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,291
In the name of Allah.

499
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:54,623
I marry off and I wed off
Malik Al Fateeh bin Muhammad Yahya...

500
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:58,707
...with Cathalina Gilia binti Paul Wijaya...

501
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:03,039
...with the dowry a set of prayer kits, in cash.

502
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:07,122
I accept Cathalina Gilia binti Paul...

503
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:42,414
Go on.

504
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:58,998
What do you think? We go back from the start?

505
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,455
In the name of Allah.

506
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:12,707
I marry off and I wed off
Malik Al Fateeh bin Muhammad Yahya...

507
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,539
...with Cathalina Gilia binti Paul Wijaya...

508
00:39:16,623 --> 00:39:20,831
...with the dowry a set of prayer kits, in cash.

509
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:25,747
I accept Cathalina Gilia binti Paul Wijaya's in
marriage...

510
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:26,999
...with the dowry in cash.

511
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,539
Witnesses? Legitimate?

512
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:30,679
Legitimate.

513
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:33,350
Thank God.

514
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,163
Mom, Dad...

515
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,370
I'm leaving.

516
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:57,914
Cathy.

517
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:05,326
May I ask for permission from your parents
for us to leave?

518
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,275
Let's just leave.

519
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,030
I'm sorry for ruining
your relationship with your parents.

520
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,331
It's okay.

521
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,830
I knew that it'll end up like this.

522
00:42:26,455 --> 00:42:27,538
Let's go.

523
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:56,111
I'm sorry, Sir. I fell asleep.

524
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:58,443
It's okay. Have you cleaned the guest room?

525
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,539
I have.

526
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:02,247
Come in, Ti.

527
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,790
I'll take you to your room.

528
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:08,482
That'll be your room.

529
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:21,622
Let's go.

530
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,810
This is Hannah's and my room.
You can sit and relax there if you want.

531
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:43,246
Sorry if it's not comfortable.

532
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:50,582
This is more than enough for me. It's clean.

533
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:56,539
I'll leave you, then.

534
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,078
I'll put your things here.

535
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:09,415
If you need anything, just call me.

536
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,538
Thanks.

537
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:19,331
- Sir.
- Yes?

538
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:20,415
Your tea.

539
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:25,207
- I didn't ask for that.
- It's okay. It's my initiative.

540
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,767
Okay, then. Just put it there.

541
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,999
Okay.

542
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:32,747
Sir...

543
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,207
- Sorry.
- Yes?

544
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,290
The guest will stay here?

545
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:41,783
She will.

546
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:46,999
Sorry again. But the guest is a woman.

547
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,830
Does Mrs. Hannah know about this?

548
00:44:52,707 --> 00:44:53,991
Here's the thing.

549
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,915
Let me tell you this to avoid any misunderstanding.

550
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:59,539
Her name's Mrs. Cathy.

551
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:02,751
She's Mrs. Hannah's best friend.

552
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:06,415
She's her doctor.

553
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,103
And she's also...

554
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:13,399
...my wife.

555
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:15,914
Sir!

556
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,623
It's not my birthday, you know.
There's no need for a prank.

557
00:45:21,707 --> 00:45:23,039
No, I'm serious.

558
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:25,791
Oh, God!

559
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:29,371
Mrs. Hannah is sick.
How could you marry another woman?

560
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:31,123
Does she know about this?

561
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:34,882
This marriage is what she wished for.

562
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:38,915
It's impossible.

563
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:43,079
Which woman wants to be cheated on?
I'm your living example.

564
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:46,623
I once got cheated on.
My husband married another woman.

565
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:51,831
I wanted to hurt that other woman.

566
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,622
I never agreed to that.

567
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:59,039
Madame Doctor. I'm sorry.

568
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,539
I was talking about my husband, not you, seriously.

569
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:08,291
Okay, then. I'm going to go pray. Excuse me.

570
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:09,578
To ask for forgiveness.

571
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:21,499
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay. Mbok Ipah is not wrong.

572
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:27,603
Being a second wife is a catch-22 situation.

573
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,623
I can't defend myself.

574
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:32,079
I’m sure everyone will understand.

575
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:34,578
It's only a matter of time.

576
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:39,079
Actually, I came here to ask you.

577
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,767
Which is the direction of qibla?

578
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,207
It's over there.

579
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,415
You... I haven't prayed, too.

580
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:46,791
Oh dear.

581
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:52,331
I should've reminded you since I'm your Imam now.

582
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:55,122
Sorry.

583
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,858
- Do you want to pray together?
- Do you want to pray together?

584
00:47:56,955 --> 00:47:59,578
<i>Operation Room</i>

585
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:15,290
Thank God.

586
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,579
Your baby has been delivered safely to this world.

587
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:22,454
Thank God.

588
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:27,078
Oh God.

589
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:30,914
What about Hannah?

590
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,455
For now...

591
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,962
...she's in a coma.

592
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,914
Be a pious kid, okay, son?

593
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:52,415
Congrats.

594
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:55,662
What's his name?

595
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:58,291
Khaltan Maliki is his name.

596
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,539
Hannah gave him that name.

597
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:05,123
It's a good name.

598
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,154
I hope she can see her baby soon.

599
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:22,631
- Here, Ma'am?
- Yes.

600
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:25,791
- Sun rays.
- Let's go in.

601
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:28,246
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you, too.

602
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:35,914
How is it? Good?

603
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,663
It's good. You did the cooking?

604
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:40,578
No. I did the ordering.

605
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:53,539
Malik, I'm sorry.
I should've prepared all this for...

606
00:51:53,623 --> 00:51:54,662
Your husband?

607
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:01,539
Still...

608
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:03,331
Still hard to say it?

609
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:05,291
Well...

610
00:52:05,371 --> 00:52:12,415
How can I say it? I honestly still can't believe
that this is our situation.

611
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:13,955
It still feels like a dream for me.

612
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:15,162
For me, too.

613
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:19,498
Do you want me to make you tea or coffee?

614
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:23,038
- Yes please. Black coffee.
- Okay.

615
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,707
Coffee.

616
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:31,954
Over there. The coffee's there.

617
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:34,706
- There.
- This? Okay.

618
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:39,831
The mug...

619
00:52:39,915 --> 00:52:42,079
The mug. Over here.

620
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,954
Sorry. The mug's here.

621
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:53,371
Do you want sugar in it or...

622
00:52:53,455 --> 00:52:55,039
No sugar.

623
00:52:55,331 --> 00:52:58,206
- Two spoons of coffee.
- Okay.

624
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:04,291
Do I need to boil some water or...

625
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:06,123
- No. Just use hot water from the dispenser.
- Okay.

626
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:08,954
- Let me. It's okay.
- No. Let me.

627
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:15,954
Sorry. I forget the spoon.

628
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:21,163
Ti...

629
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:22,830
I think we should...

630
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,455
...start...

631
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,247
...familiarizing ourselves to...

632
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:30,870
How do I say it?

633
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,079
We should familiarize ourselves...

634
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:35,498
To be husband and wife?

635
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:37,758
Right.

636
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:43,554
It's still hard for you to say it.

637
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:50,079
Honestly, it's harder than when...

638
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:53,238
...I professed my love to you back then.

639
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:02,123
Can I drink that?

640
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:04,706
- You can.
- Thanks.

641
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:10,831
Be careful, it's hot.

642
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,499
I mean...

643
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:17,123
- Sorry, I forget to tell you.
- It's hot. It's okay.

644
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:18,330
It's okay.

645
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,662
Do you want us to share a room tonight or what?

646
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:38,331
Aren't you supposed to stay the night
at the hospital?

647
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:40,955
You're right. I...

648
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,499
- I need to go to the hospital.
- You better go to the hospital so you are calm.

649
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:49,079
Ti, sorry, I...

650
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:50,371
I didn't mean to...

651
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:53,163
It's okay. I totally get it.

652
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:56,791
Right now you don't need to think about me.

653
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:58,707
You have to put Hannah first.

654
00:54:59,747 --> 00:55:02,331
- Just go. It's late.
- Okay.

655
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:03,662
I'll get ready.

656
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:09,350
I'm going to put the coffee here.

657
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:22,079
I was cleaning and I saw your husband's photos.

658
00:55:22,163 --> 00:55:24,123
But the pictures aren't with you.

659
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:29,079
Sumi, why do you ask that?

660
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:32,791
You're not mad at me, aren't you? I'm sorry.

661
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,579
It's okay. I'm not mad.

662
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,830
She's his first wife.

663
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:42,331
Her name's Hannah.

664
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:45,999
She's in the hospital.

665
00:55:47,163 --> 00:55:50,246
She's in a coma after delivering Althan to this world.

666
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:57,366
Does that mean you're the second wife?

667
00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:04,871
But you're beautiful, nice, a doctor.

668
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:07,870
Why did you want to be a second wife?

669
00:56:13,363 --> 00:56:14,447
Sumi!

670
00:56:15,547 --> 00:56:17,331
I believe...

671
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,415
...that our soulmate is God's mystery.

672
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:25,415
And Allah must've prepared
the best destiny for me.

673
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:28,455
So I can only surrender to His will.

674
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:29,914
But do you love your husband?

675
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,539
Forgive me. I won't ask any questions again.

676
00:56:38,747 --> 00:56:42,870
If I didn't love him...

677
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:46,802
...I wouldn't be here right now.

678
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,291
Sir.

679
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,163
Ti, the car is here.

680
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:03,370
Okay. I'm ready. I can leave right away.

681
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:13,331
I'm going to post it. The hottest babysitter group.

682
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:15,371
Great!

683
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:18,579
Oh, dear! So handsome.

684
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:19,914
Hey!

685
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,331
Who are you? How dare you touch the baby?
Have you washed your hands?

686
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:25,539
- Hey! I should be the one asking who you are.
- Sumi.

687
00:57:25,623 --> 00:57:28,079
You're new here. I've worked here longer.

688
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:29,955
I took care of this baby's mother.

689
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:32,747
And I'm responsible for this baby.

690
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:35,831
I even ask his father to wash his hands first.

691
00:57:35,915 --> 00:57:37,999
You ugly Sundanese!

692
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,371
Oh, God. I know you're old, but you're racist.

693
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:44,247
You can't be racist, you know!

694
00:57:45,123 --> 00:57:47,455
Who's racist here? It's you!

695
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:51,371
You took selfies. You took your own pictures.
Your face won't change at all.

696
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:56,247
Old people won't understand
the difference between racist and narcissistic.

697
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:58,039
- What's going on?
- It's her fault.

698
00:57:58,123 --> 00:58:02,371
It's hers. This babysister
didn't allow me to touch Mrs. Hannah's baby.

699
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:07,539
Sister? If you want to touch the baby,
you need to wash your hand. Am I right?

700
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:09,291
Mbok, she's right.

701
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:11,623
- Is Mrs. Hannah good?
- Pray for her.

702
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:12,831
For sure.

703
00:58:12,915 --> 00:58:14,791
Sumi, this is Mbok Ipah.

704
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:17,079
- She has worked here for a long time.
- Yes, Sir.

705
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:18,915
Hear that?

706
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,415
I'm a senior here.

707
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:26,747
Seniority is outdated.
It's a thing of the past. How old are you?

708
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:29,999
Stop fighting. You're making so much noise.
Poor Althan.

709
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,898
- I'm late.
- Drive safe.

710
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:39,539
Today's seminar was long.

711
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:42,915
By the way, aren't you going to join us for dinner?

712
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:47,415
Sorry, but I can't.
I have to make a call in my room.

713
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:49,415
Who are you going to call?

714
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:53,623
I'm going to call the babysitter,
to check on my child.

715
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:58,123
- Babysitter?
- You get it.

716
00:58:58,207 --> 00:59:01,331
The newlywed.
You can't stand being apart from your husband, can you?

717
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:02,831
What are you talking about?

718
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:06,123
- Okay, then. See you tonight, okay?
- Okay. Bye!

719
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:07,790
- Bye.
- We're leaving. Let's go.

720
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:15,370
Hey.

721
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:18,794
Malik?

722
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:22,586
What are you doing here?

723
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,039
You won't believe this.

724
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:28,079
I also have a meeting here.

725
00:59:30,707 --> 00:59:33,415
- Okay. A coincidence?
- Yes.

726
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:37,579
- We happen to have meetings here.
- Yes. What a coincidence.

727
00:59:37,663 --> 00:59:39,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,415
See? You don't believe me.

729
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:43,663
No, I believe you.

730
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,087
But what about Althan?

731
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:48,871
He's home. He's calm with Sumi.

732
00:59:50,547 --> 00:59:52,839
Are you busy tonight? Let's have dinner.

733
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:56,791
I see.

734
00:59:56,871 --> 01:00:00,623
Are you here just to ask me
to have dinner with you?

735
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03,291
Is that it?

736
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:06,079
No. I really had a meeting here.

737
01:00:06,163 --> 01:00:11,207
You happened to be here, too. So, why not?

738
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:13,955
- Okay.
- So...

739
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,746
I'm going to wait in the lobby, okay?

740
01:00:17,623 --> 01:00:21,611
But why should I wait in the lobby?
Since we're...

741
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:24,423
- Husband and wife?
- Husband and wife.

742
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:27,122
Is it still hard for you to say it?

743
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,418
Well...

744
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,291
So? Where should I wait?

745
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:39,415
Well...

746
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,162
It's up to you.

747
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:05,622
Let's go.

748
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,622
You look different.

749
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:18,663
Different...

750
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:20,691
...how?

751
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:22,970
Beautiful.

752
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:27,622
Thank you.

753
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:08,415
Look like who?

754
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,271
- Not similar like you.
- Really?

755
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:12,723
- Of course.
- His handsome.

756
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:17,455
How are you, big sister?

757
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:19,870
How are you?

758
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,466
I'm good.

759
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:27,954
How are Mom and Dad?

760
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,290
They're good.

761
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:37,623
Honey...

762
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:41,791
Get in if you don't feel well.

763
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:43,371
You'll get sick.

764
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,871
It's nice here.

765
01:02:45,879 --> 01:02:47,707
I brought you medicine. Drink it.

766
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,123
Just put it there. I'll take it.

767
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:50,178
Okay.

768
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:04,691
Cathy?

769
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,078
It's Cathy, honey.

770
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:12,454
Is that my grandson?

771
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:20,291
Hello!

772
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:21,579
Hello!

773
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:25,130
Call me Grandad. Or is it Grandpa?

774
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:30,579
Honey...

775
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:32,622
Cathy's here.

776
01:04:06,371 --> 01:04:07,662
What's his name?

777
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:22,707
His name is...

778
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:23,870
...Althan.

779
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:30,370
Althan.

780
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:50,291
Mr. Malik, your wife needs to keep using the
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine.

781
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:55,663
Medically, she's still alive
with the help of the machine.

782
01:04:55,747 --> 01:05:00,914
But there's nothing else we can do
until she recovers from her coma.

783
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:49,123
Be strong and be patient.

784
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:52,999
I know you've done your best for Hannah.

785
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,246
But if she's not out of this condition...

786
01:05:56,747 --> 01:05:57,914
...it'll be a pity for her.

787
01:06:18,663 --> 01:06:22,455
Oh dear. Sorry to keep you waiting this long.

788
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:24,622
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

789
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:32,954
What's wrong with you?

790
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,291
What do you think?

791
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,123
Are you asking me as your wife?

792
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,622
Or as a doctor?

793
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,003
Both.

794
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,419
As a wife...

795
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:54,747
...I will always support my husband's decision.

796
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:57,999
But as a doctor...

797
01:06:59,955 --> 01:07:05,207
...medically, the only thing
that is keeping Hannah alive right now...

798
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,574
...is the machine.

799
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:14,587
Hey.

800
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:15,958
Honey.

801
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:17,914
It's okay.

802
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:34,622
Hey.

803
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:39,870
It's fine.

804
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:44,703
You don't need to force everything.

805
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:50,162
If you can't, don't do it.

806
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:54,454
It's okay.

807
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:51,830
Honey, I'm sorry if what I did is wrong.

808
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:55,998
I'm sorry.

809
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,078
I just don't want you to suffer any longer.

810
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:39,455
I bear witness that there is no deity
(none truly to be worshipped) but Allah...

811
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:42,791
...and I bear witness
that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.

812
01:09:42,871 --> 01:09:45,079
I bear witness that there is no deity
(none truly to be worshipped) but Allah...

813
01:09:46,207 --> 01:09:49,206
...and I bear witness
that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.

814
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:23,998
Hannah?

815
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:28,623
Honey?

816
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:32,623
Thank God.

817
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:35,291
God has shown His greatness.

818
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,415
Nothing is impossible for Him.

819
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:39,538
Come with me.

820
01:11:55,371 --> 01:11:56,371
Hannah?

821
01:11:57,287 --> 01:11:58,366
Na?

822
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:01,455
Hannah?

823
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,579
You're awake.

824
01:12:03,663 --> 01:12:05,539
Hi, honey.

825
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:07,578
Thank God!

826
01:12:10,415 --> 01:12:12,247
Why am I here?

827
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,579
Did you forget?

828
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:18,291
But you remember me, don't you?

829
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:19,370
Malik.

830
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:24,619
Hi, Han.

831
01:12:24,871 --> 01:12:26,039
Who is this?

832
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:29,331
Honey, this is Cathy.

833
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:30,499
Cathy?

834
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,663
- She was...
- I'm...

835
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:34,890
...your doctor.

836
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:45,079
Because you’ve just woken up from your long coma,
you need to rest a lot.

837
01:12:45,163 --> 01:12:46,578
Excuse me.

838
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:00,291
Cathy.

839
01:13:03,183 --> 01:13:05,727
Why did you tell Hannah...

840
01:13:05,811 --> 01:13:07,914
...that you're her doctor?

841
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,791
Well, I am.

842
01:13:09,871 --> 01:13:11,122
I mean...

843
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:14,454
...I was going to say that...

844
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,414
...that you're my wife.

845
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,871
I talked to Dr. Mulia.

846
01:13:27,663 --> 01:13:28,915
He said that...

847
01:13:30,915 --> 01:13:33,707
...Hannah is having amnesia anterograde.

848
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:37,955
She can't remember what has just happened.

849
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:42,331
She can only remember information
or events that happened in the past.

850
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:46,454
That's why she can't remember who I am.

851
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:51,370
And why she forgot that...

852
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:54,830
...we're married.

853
01:13:57,747 --> 01:14:00,707
I'll try to tell her.

854
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:02,515
Malik, don't.

855
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:04,367
For now...

856
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:08,038
...don't burden her mind too much.

857
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:14,747
Let's just wait...

858
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,747
...until she fully recovers.

859
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:20,579
What do you mean?

860
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:24,915
I doubt...

861
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:29,538
...that Hannah's decision to ask us to marry...

862
01:14:32,455 --> 01:14:34,830
Maybe she didn't fully realize it.

863
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:38,579
I'm scared, Malik.

864
01:14:38,663 --> 01:14:42,163
I'm scared that when she remembers everything...

865
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:44,955
...she can't accept that we're married.

866
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:49,915
But everything has happened. You're my wife now.

867
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,706
And I want you to still be there
for me and Althan.

868
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:23,998
Hey.

869
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:25,415
Nana, what are you doing?

870
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:28,331
- I'm going to check on Althan.
- He's... Stop it.

871
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:32,791
- You can't be tired. Don't move too much. Take rest.
- The baby's crying. That poor little thing.

872
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:37,999
- I want to see him.
- Let him be, honey. Titi's there to take care of him.

873
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:39,162
Titi's there already.

874
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,039
Cathy is your doctor, honey.

875
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:46,914
She was also our friend back in high school.

876
01:15:48,163 --> 01:15:50,498
While you were in a coma,
she took care of Althan.

877
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:56,663
So all this time...

878
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,291
...she has been living here?

879
01:15:59,371 --> 01:16:00,579
She has.

880
01:16:00,663 --> 01:16:03,370
Sometimes she needs to stay the night
because Althan can't be left alone.

881
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:09,999
Don't think about it. Just rest.

882
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:12,039
Why is she willing to do that?

883
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,331
If you were in her position,
I'm sure you'd do the same thing.

884
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:21,498
Because you have a big heart.

885
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,623
Help me.

886
01:16:28,707 --> 01:16:31,579
- Your legs...
- They're so weak.

887
01:16:31,663 --> 01:16:32,791
Hi, Han.

888
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:35,515
Hi.

889
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:37,330
You still can't remember who I am?

890
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:43,791
Han...

891
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,915
...I'm Cathy.

892
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,247
Your friend from high school.

893
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:50,746
We often hung out together back in school.

894
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:59,163
Hang on. I think I still kept our photo
from back then.

895
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,798
Here. See? It was a long time ago.

896
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:09,455
It's okay.

897
01:17:09,539 --> 01:17:14,038
Okay, I'm Cathy Meow.

898
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:17,839
Meow.

899
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:22,078
Cathy...

900
01:17:24,547 --> 01:17:27,135
Cathy Meow.

901
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:30,079
Cathy... Cathy!

902
01:17:30,163 --> 01:17:31,998
Cathy! Oh God!

903
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:33,747
Yes, I remember.

904
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:36,851
So sorry. Oh dear!

905
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:40,163
By the way, thanks a lot.

906
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:41,579
Malik has told me.

907
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:45,455
You took care of Althan while I was in a coma.

908
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:46,662
Han...

909
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:50,663
...I love Althan so much.

910
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,539
And if you allow me...

911
01:17:53,431 --> 01:17:55,670
...I'd love to keep taking care of him.

912
01:17:58,455 --> 01:18:00,039
For sure.

913
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:05,999
Hello, Mother. Your son is sleeping.

914
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,123
- He was sleepy after his bath.
- Honey. Come here.

915
01:18:11,163 --> 01:18:12,955
Hello, Son.

916
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:18,579
There are always lies in polygamy.

917
01:18:18,663 --> 01:18:21,747
Our boss asked us to lie, didn't he?

918
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:25,247
Right. But it's for the good of everybody.

919
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:27,663
Look at Mrs. Hannah, she's still unwell.

920
01:18:27,747 --> 01:18:31,207
They'll tell her slowly. Be patient.

921
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,707
- You bad woman.
- Why are you hitting me?

922
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:36,207
You're the doctor's supporter. Team Cheater.

923
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:41,499
I'm not on anyone's team. I take no side.

924
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:46,999
Let it go. Let's just pray that they get along well
and be happy. Just look at them.

925
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:50,999
Hey. Cut your ear if they get along well.

926
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:55,291
I've had experiences with being cheated on.

927
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:58,539
It hurts so much here.

928
01:18:58,623 --> 01:19:02,663
Look. She can smile on the outside,
but I bet she wants to choke her.

929
01:19:02,747 --> 01:19:04,791
Don't choke me.

930
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:08,039
Sorry, Bi Ipah.

931
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:10,915
Don't think everyone is the same as you.

932
01:19:10,999 --> 01:19:13,415
Look at them.

933
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:19,123
They're educated, smart, and able to think.
They have brains. Got it?

934
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:23,831
You think I have nothing inside my skull?

935
01:19:23,915 --> 01:19:27,831
- It's not like that.
- You ugly Sundanese!

936
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:30,663
What? Ugly Sundanese what?

937
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:32,955
- What?
- Nothing.

938
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:37,331
You'll think of me as a narcissist,
talking about an ethnic group.

939
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:39,662
Not "narcist"...

940
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,078
I'm tired.

941
01:19:44,831 --> 01:19:46,871
I'm also tired.

942
01:19:46,955 --> 01:19:47,998
Do you know?

943
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:55,374
My biggest reason to stay alive is you.

944
01:19:56,579 --> 01:20:00,135
I want to stay with you forever.

945
01:20:00,219 --> 01:20:02,915
I want to be with you until I'm old.

946
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:07,246
Okay, honey. We're going to grow old together.

947
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:33,079
Honey...

948
01:20:33,163 --> 01:20:34,539
Hello, Son.

949
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:35,882
Hi, honey.

950
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,331
It's me, your mom.

951
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:43,974
- What's wrong, kid? It's your mom.
- It's me, your mother.

952
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:46,791
Cath...

953
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,750
Honey, it's me, your mom.

954
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:57,546
What's wrong? Oh, honey. It's okay, kid.

955
01:21:04,623 --> 01:21:05,707
It's okay.

956
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:07,246
It's okay, kid.

957
01:21:10,123 --> 01:21:15,499
Cath, if you want to eat something
or if you crave anything...

958
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,291
...just ask Mbok Ipah, okay?

959
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:20,455
Okay, Han. Thank you.

960
01:21:20,539 --> 01:21:24,707
I promised Titi to cook her my fish recipe.

961
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,538
It'll be so good.

962
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,370
You call her Titi?

963
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:39,123
I do.

964
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:45,055
I usually call people by their last syllable.
Just like I call you Nana. Am I right?

965
01:21:45,123 --> 01:21:47,122
That's how I call my other friends, too.

966
01:21:48,343 --> 01:21:49,463
Do you forget?

967
01:21:50,163 --> 01:21:51,370
And what do you call him?

968
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:58,871
I...

969
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,707
...call him...

970
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:01,831
...Malik.

971
01:22:03,455 --> 01:22:04,539
Malik, honey.

972
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:07,138
I thought you call him "Liklik".

973
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:10,319
So funny.

974
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:13,206
"Liklik".

975
01:22:28,623 --> 01:22:31,706
Malik, I can't keep doing this.

976
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:36,414
I’m feeling more guilty every day.

977
01:22:44,247 --> 01:22:46,118
It's time for us to be frank with her.

978
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:54,163
But what if she can't accept everything?

979
01:22:54,247 --> 01:22:55,622
She'll accept it.

980
01:22:59,163 --> 01:23:01,415
We're going to find a good time to talk to her.

981
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:02,662
Okay?

982
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:30,246
I'm fine.

983
01:23:32,135 --> 01:23:34,371
- Morning, Mbok.
- Morning, Madame Doctor.

984
01:23:34,455 --> 01:23:36,415
- Morning, Han.
- Morning.

985
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:38,499
- Morning, Ti.
- You don't need to. I'm fine.

986
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:41,499
You look pretty today. Fresh.

987
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:43,218
Did you sleep well last night?

988
01:23:44,623 --> 01:23:48,623
Yeah. It rained last night, so I slept better.

989
01:23:48,707 --> 01:23:49,915
Oh.

990
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,746
It's okay. I can do it myself.

991
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:05,831
Mbok, change the doctor's bed sheet.

992
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:08,123
I did it yesterday.

993
01:24:08,207 --> 01:24:13,291
It's still clean anyway. No need to change it.

994
01:24:13,371 --> 01:24:16,246
It's fine. Just change it.
To keep it clean all the time.

995
01:24:22,247 --> 01:24:24,499
Nana is worried that you're not comfortable.

996
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:28,499
If you don't like it here,
she won't have her own private doctor.

997
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:30,623
Am I right?

998
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:32,247
Who is worried? Me or you?

999
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:39,291
If Titi's not here anymore...

1000
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,454
...it'll be hard for you
to take care of me and Althan. Am I right?

1001
01:24:53,207 --> 01:24:55,407
No. It's okay. Carry on with your breakfast.

1002
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:58,415
- But Althan's crying.
- He's my son.

1003
01:24:58,499 --> 01:25:02,330
Can't I take care of my own son? I'm her mother.

1004
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,623
- Carry on.
- Sumi is there.

1005
01:25:06,707 --> 01:25:08,791
No. I want to take care of him myself.

1006
01:25:10,955 --> 01:25:12,123
Okay.

1007
01:25:14,955 --> 01:25:16,883
Hey, Malik...

1008
01:25:16,955 --> 01:25:20,123
...from now on,
you don't need to take care of me that much.

1009
01:25:20,207 --> 01:25:23,538
I'm fine. I can do everything myself. I'm healthy.

1010
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,291
Okay?

1011
01:25:27,663 --> 01:25:29,371
Carry on with your breakfast.

1012
01:25:31,003 --> 01:25:32,211
Have a nice breakfast.

1013
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:40,623
Althan, my son, come here. Why are you crying?

1014
01:25:40,707 --> 01:25:42,707
Come here.

1015
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:45,307
Honey.

1016
01:25:45,871 --> 01:25:46,915
Ti?

1017
01:25:47,955 --> 01:25:48,999
Hey.

1018
01:25:50,295 --> 01:25:52,055
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

1019
01:25:55,955 --> 01:25:57,331
What's going on?

1020
01:25:57,415 --> 01:25:59,370
I want everything to end, Malik.

1021
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,123
Yes, I also want everything to end.

1022
01:26:04,207 --> 01:26:07,247
I'm tired of pretending.

1023
01:26:07,331 --> 01:26:09,039
Let's talk to Hannah tomorrow.

1024
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,331
That's not what I mean.

1025
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:13,579
I want...

1026
01:26:15,531 --> 01:26:18,127
...Hannah to remember me as just her best friend.

1027
01:26:19,499 --> 01:26:22,483
So, I'm going to leave your life.

1028
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:23,662
No.

1029
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,163
No one's leaving.

1030
01:26:27,247 --> 01:26:28,914
Malik, you need to understand.

1031
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:34,371
I love you.

1032
01:26:35,663 --> 01:26:38,079
But there's someone else
who is more deserving of your love.

1033
01:26:39,163 --> 01:26:41,290
I'm truly happy with you.

1034
01:26:45,499 --> 01:26:48,207
But it's more important for you
to make someone else happy.

1035
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,538
I am your wife.

1036
01:26:56,623 --> 01:26:59,622
But there's someone else
who needs you more as a husband.

1037
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:03,662
So, you don't need me?

1038
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:10,830
- You regret this marriage?
- Malik, I will never regret our marriage.

1039
01:27:12,415 --> 01:27:17,455
Marrying you was what I have always wanted.

1040
01:27:18,955 --> 01:27:23,414
And I will remember you forever.

1041
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:29,830
Forgive me.

1042
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:36,455
But this is the best thing for all of us.

1043
01:27:37,275 --> 01:27:39,398
You can't just disappear from my life.

1044
01:27:43,455 --> 01:27:46,330
Because now I love two amazing women.

1045
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:09,039
- Sumi? Mbok? What's going on?
- Ma'am.

1046
01:28:09,123 --> 01:28:12,207
Althan is crying inside.

1047
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,955
But I don't dare to go inside.

1048
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:18,163
But he's been crying for 30 minutes.
Help me. I'm scared.

1049
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:21,455
- That's right. The baby can be possessed.
- Right.

1050
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:24,539
Wait, no. Not possessed.
What are you talking about?

1051
01:28:24,623 --> 01:28:28,246
- Not possessed. Help us.
- Okay, okay.

1052
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:35,079
Han?

1053
01:28:35,163 --> 01:28:36,455
Who's there?

1054
01:28:36,539 --> 01:28:38,246
It's me, Cathy.

1055
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:48,039
Can I hold Althan for a while to calm him down?

1056
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:52,871
Sumi, Mbok...

1057
01:28:52,955 --> 01:28:55,579
- Take care of Althan.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1058
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:56,830
Be careful, Ma'am.

1059
01:29:02,915 --> 01:29:07,498
Althan needs to familiarize himself with me,
or else there'll be distance between us.

1060
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:11,331
Han, there's no way that
there'll be distance between the two of you.

1061
01:29:11,415 --> 01:29:13,162
You're his birth mother.

1062
01:29:16,663 --> 01:29:18,954
But in reality, he's closer to you.

1063
01:29:24,499 --> 01:29:25,498
Let's sit.

1064
01:29:32,207 --> 01:29:33,375
Cathy...

1065
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,914
You can take my husband.

1066
01:29:38,455 --> 01:29:39,998
But not my son.

1067
01:29:41,999 --> 01:29:43,746
- Han, what are you...
- Sit.

1068
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,038
Sit down.

1069
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:52,163
I didn't expect it, you know...

1070
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:55,850
...for you to be that evil.

1071
01:29:56,579 --> 01:29:57,954
Diabolical.

1072
01:30:00,707 --> 01:30:04,955
- Cath... No.
- Let me explain.

1073
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:06,291
I saw it myself.

1074
01:30:07,455 --> 01:30:09,539
I saw it clearly.

1075
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:13,915
You and Malik.

1076
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:18,079
In your room together.

1077
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,622
Under this roof.

1078
01:30:25,331 --> 01:30:26,999
How could you?

1079
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:29,331
- You betrayed your own best friend.
- Han...

1080
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,207
- Hannah, please.
- You made my house dirty.

1081
01:30:34,291 --> 01:30:37,163
- Han, please.
- I should've known...

1082
01:30:37,247 --> 01:30:40,206
...that you can never stop loving him.

1083
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:02,662
Listen to me.

1084
01:31:07,371 --> 01:31:10,498
You can take Malik away. Be my guest.

1085
01:31:13,123 --> 01:31:18,702
Be my guest, Cath.
I don't need a cheater like him.

1086
01:31:24,247 --> 01:31:26,414
But don't take my child away from me.

1087
01:31:33,747 --> 01:31:35,122
In the end...

1088
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:37,915
...a traitor...

1089
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:41,330
...will also meet a traitor.

1090
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,039
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am, where are you going?

1091
01:32:35,123 --> 01:32:39,078
Mbok Ipah, Sumi, I'm leaving, okay?

1092
01:32:40,123 --> 01:32:43,499
Please take care of Hannah and Althan.

1093
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:48,579
Oh, dear. I swear to God,
it wasn't me who told her.

1094
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:55,946
I used to be Team Mrs. Hannah,
but I've realized that you've done no wrong.

1095
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:58,499
I know, I believe that.

1096
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:03,206
Thanks for helping me all this time.

1097
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:10,038
It's okay.

1098
01:33:28,955 --> 01:33:30,455
Sir!

1099
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:33,079
The doctor was just leaving,
bringing all of her things.

1100
01:33:33,163 --> 01:33:37,791
- Leaving?
- And Mrs. Hannah asked me to pack her clothes.

1101
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:40,579
She said she was going to leave, too.

1102
01:33:40,663 --> 01:33:42,247
Oh, dear. Hannah...

1103
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:44,875
That's why you shouldn't do polygamy.

1104
01:33:44,959 --> 01:33:46,831
- It's not good.
- Bibi!

1105
01:33:46,915 --> 01:33:49,955
- What are you saying?
- That's the reason for all of this!

1106
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:52,123
- I know!
- What should we do?

1107
01:33:52,207 --> 01:33:54,830
- Poor Mrs. Hannah and the doctor.
- Sir!

1108
01:33:56,415 --> 01:33:59,579
Hannah, hey. What are you doing?

1109
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:01,163
Leave me alone!

1110
01:34:01,247 --> 01:34:02,415
Hannah, wait.

1111
01:34:02,499 --> 01:34:04,371
Let me go!

1112
01:34:04,455 --> 01:34:06,831
- Hannah, listen to my explanation. Don't cry.
- Let me go!

1113
01:34:06,915 --> 01:34:09,123
I'm not crying because of you.

1114
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:13,162
You're not worthy of my tears.

1115
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:21,811
I'm crying because
my thoughts of who you are is all ruined...

1116
01:34:23,775 --> 01:34:26,274
...by the reality of who you actually are.

1117
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:30,871
- Hey, hold on.
- Malik, let me go!

1118
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:33,955
I'd like to show you something. Hold on.

1119
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:35,078
Hold on.

1120
01:34:37,455 --> 01:34:38,538
Look at this.

1121
01:34:40,019 --> 01:34:41,142
Here.

1122
01:34:49,707 --> 01:34:51,746
Why was I there?

1123
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,370
Forgive me for not explaining it to you earlier.

1124
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,454
The marriage happened
because you gave us permission.

1125
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:12,123
"In the name of Allah."

1126
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,246
In the name of Allah.

1127
01:35:17,499 --> 01:35:19,830
"I will...

1128
01:35:20,831 --> 01:35:23,579
...marry your husband."

1129
01:35:23,663 --> 01:35:28,955
This marriage would never have happened
if Cathy and I didn't want to make you happy.

1130
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:31,078
And why are you telling me just now?

1131
01:35:40,499 --> 01:35:42,123
Because you have amnesia.

1132
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:48,330
Cathy didn't want to tell you too soon.
She wanted to wait for you to fully recover.

1133
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,038
You were the one
who asked for this marriage, Hannah.

1134
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,039
You were a witness. You gave us permission.

1135
01:35:59,123 --> 01:36:00,623
But now Cathy yields.

1136
01:36:00,707 --> 01:36:03,454
She doesn't want you
to ever remember this marriage.

1137
01:36:08,163 --> 01:36:10,330
She sacrificed herself for your happiness.

1138
01:36:15,271 --> 01:36:16,979
And now she just wants...

1139
01:36:19,123 --> 01:36:21,830
...me to be with you and Althan.

1140
01:36:26,663 --> 01:36:28,078
We got married for you.

1141
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:39,038
And now Cathy chooses to part from me for you.

1142
01:37:14,747 --> 01:37:16,163
Forgive me, Cath.

1143
01:37:16,999 --> 01:37:18,330
I'm truly sorry.

1144
01:37:21,779 --> 01:37:23,946
You're an amazing woman, Cath.

1145
01:37:25,915 --> 01:37:29,830
Forgive me for having bad thoughts about you.

1146
01:37:34,179 --> 01:37:38,010
I'm so ungrateful. Forgive me.

1147
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:45,110
I begged you...

1148
01:37:49,707 --> 01:37:51,498
...to marry Malik.

1149
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:55,662
And now I'm here...

1150
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:59,870
...to beg you once more...

1151
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:05,999
...to come home.

1152
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:07,454
To our home.

1153
01:38:10,207 --> 01:38:11,746
For your husband.

1154
01:38:15,915 --> 01:38:17,123
For me.

1155
01:38:18,579 --> 01:38:20,331
And our son, Althan.

1156
01:38:22,871 --> 01:38:24,038
Okay?

1157
01:38:52,707 --> 01:38:57,163
<i>No woman wants to be a concubine.</i>

1158
01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:07,162
<i>Every woman dreams of being the first
and the only one loved by the man we love.</i>

1159
01:39:23,831 --> 01:39:27,275
<i>But sometimes destiny tells a different story.</i>

1160
01:39:27,799 --> 01:39:29,999
<i>What's important is how we deal with it.</i>

1161
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:31,123
How cute.

1162
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:32,998
One, two...

1163
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:42,623
<i>Because happiness is not what we fantasize about.</i>

1164
01:39:42,707 --> 01:39:44,871
<i>But what we're living.</i>

1165
01:39:44,955 --> 01:39:46,290
Clap your hands.

1166
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:49,991
Ti.

1167
01:39:51,331 --> 01:39:52,415
Tell her.

1168
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:57,663
Later. Or you tell her.

1169
01:39:57,747 --> 01:40:00,371
- You should tell her.
- Tell me what?

1170
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:03,822
Cath?

1171
01:40:07,163 --> 01:40:08,326
What?

1172
01:40:15,095 --> 01:40:16,294
Cathy pregnant.

1173
01:40:21,887 --> 01:40:23,218
Seriously?

1174
01:40:25,455 --> 01:40:27,290
You're pregnant, Cath?

1175
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:31,414
Thank God.

1176
01:40:33,579 --> 01:40:35,870
This is truly a miracle.

1177
01:40:37,147 --> 01:40:39,606
Althan will soon have a sibling.

1178
01:40:41,871 --> 01:40:44,038
Although it's not from my womb.

1179
01:40:48,163 --> 01:40:50,623
Congrats.

1180
01:40:50,707 --> 01:40:52,122
Thank you.

1181
01:40:57,323 --> 01:40:59,242
Althan will soon have a sibling.

1182
01:41:08,455 --> 01:41:13,414
<i>And with Malik and Hannah,
I can feel the happiness of sharing.</i>

1183
01:41:18,207 --> 01:41:24,415
<i>We fill each other's lives, we learn from each other,
we give to one another, and we love each other.</i>

1184
01:41:24,499 --> 01:41:28,206
<i>And we can be happy in our own way.</i>

1185
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:40,831
Good morning, my loves.

1186
01:41:40,915 --> 01:41:42,870
I'm happy to see you.

1187
01:41:44,163 --> 01:41:45,371
So beautiful.

1188
01:41:47,455 --> 01:41:52,707
I bet you're happy to see me happy
with my husband.

1189
01:41:52,791 --> 01:41:55,539
With my son.

1190
01:41:55,623 --> 01:41:57,414
With my husband's concubine.

1191
01:42:10,455 --> 01:42:11,579
Hannah?

1192
01:42:11,663 --> 01:42:12,791
Oh, dear.

1193
01:42:13,947 --> 01:42:15,486
Hannah? Oh, dear!

1194
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:19,782
Oh, dear! Ma'am!

1195
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:24,007
- Hannah?
- Malik.

1196
01:42:24,923 --> 01:42:26,630
She's still unconscious.

1197
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:29,707
But how is she doing?

1198
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:33,831
The doctors have checked her and...

1199
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:35,290
Let's hope she wakes up soon.

1200
01:42:37,455 --> 01:42:38,871
Malik.

1201
01:42:38,955 --> 01:42:40,079
Hannah?

1202
01:42:43,415 --> 01:42:44,454
Hannah?

1203
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:50,414
Cath?

1204
01:42:56,131 --> 01:43:01,922
I'm thankful that God has given me time...

1205
01:43:04,747 --> 01:43:06,746
...to meet Althan.

1206
01:43:08,371 --> 01:43:10,662
To play with him.

1207
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:14,834
And I'm certain...

1208
01:43:17,999 --> 01:43:19,290
...my husband...

1209
01:43:20,535 --> 01:43:22,119
...and my son...

1210
01:43:23,895 --> 01:43:26,478
...will be happy with you.

1211
01:43:28,915 --> 01:43:31,830
I'm ready for God to call me to His side.

1212
01:43:33,955 --> 01:43:35,831
Han...

1213
01:43:35,915 --> 01:43:37,871
Don't say that.

1214
01:43:38,791 --> 01:43:40,331
You have to remember...

1215
01:43:43,371 --> 01:43:46,538
...I will always be with you two.

1216
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,290
I will always love you two.

1217
01:44:03,415 --> 01:44:04,830
And we...

1218
01:44:08,747 --> 01:44:12,330
We will always be together.

1219
01:45:03,507 --> 01:45:04,507
Hannah.

1220
01:45:05,655 --> 01:45:08,419
Although we live together
only for a short time...

1221
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:12,967
...but you give me a lot of lessons.

1222
01:45:14,171 --> 01:45:15,802
About love...

1223
01:45:16,467 --> 01:45:18,003
...sincerity...

1224
01:45:18,903 --> 01:45:20,631
...and sacrifice.

1225
01:45:21,755 --> 01:45:25,051
And I will tell our son...

1226
01:45:26,091 --> 01:45:30,286
...that he's lucky
to have had an amazing mother.

1227
01:45:35,107 --> 01:45:36,107
Han...

1228
01:45:37,607 --> 01:45:40,655
...I'm a nobody compared to you.

1229
01:45:42,843 --> 01:45:44,983
And until the end of time...

1230
01:45:46,255 --> 01:45:48,951
...I can never replace you.

1231
01:45:50,207 --> 01:45:54,802
But I will try to fulfill your wish...

1232
01:45:56,411 --> 01:45:58,263
...to care for...

1233
01:45:58,515 --> 01:46:01,191
