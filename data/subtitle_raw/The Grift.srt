1
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:25,818
The Grift

2
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:30,846
Why not? Life 
he turns to day. 

3
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:36,965
How soon can 
pass something so unexpected, 

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,879
and a person's life 
can change forever. 

5
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:45,482
Perhaps it was decided 
in the sky for some time ... 

6
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:52,086
because I think there are people who 
naci? under the shadow of the devil ... 

7
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:57,088
and bad things will pass without 
matter the way they choose. 

8
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:02,462
All families have their secrets, 

9
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:06,409
whispered stories behind 
closed doors. 

10
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,061
My mother hopes? That age I had 
enough to tell us. 

11
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:17,292
He had been a bad year in the village, 

12
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:20,982
the river that spring growth? both ... 

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,683
the people almost flot? 

14
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,423
Then came the drought ... 

15
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:30,851
the summer and warmer 
we all remember. 

16
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:37,157
After the flood, 
and heat desperate ... 

17
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,674
The dried came too. 

18
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:48,438
and was in that summer, moved. 

19
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,464
Hello? 

20
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,368
Hello? 

21
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,313
Hello? Anybody? 

22
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,014
I am a customer ... 

23
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:26,732
?Qu? Can you bring? 

24
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:31,925
How about ... a coca cola. 

25
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,871
Cold ... please. 

26
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,887
Thank you, ma'am. 

27
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,795
- Is it hot, no? 
- Too. 

28
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,304
?Qu? Sell? 

29
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:08,017
Jewelry, kitchen, glasses ... 
pens, perfumes ... 

30
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:11,042
You say, the most 
Chances are you have it. 

31
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,457
- Really? 
- If it is a fact ... 

32
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:22,198
I come from a large sale of 
state get? some good things. 

33
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:25,038
Here is something that may interest you. 

34
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,752
Zafiros genuine 

35
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:38,995
Pearl of Madagascar 
21 mounted in gold. Lindo ?no? 

36
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,179
- Here? 
- Yes. 

37
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,923
- Do you like? 
- Combine with your eyes, lady. 

38
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:02,654
I do not like boasting, but 
People say I have a good eye. 

39
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,653
Continue. 

40
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:25,027
- Where is it going? 
- I'm way to Chicago. 

41
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,689
- To your house? 
- No, sir ... 

42
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:32,186
... that old road is my home. 

43
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:36,644
- No family? 
- No, no. 

44
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:44,522
I always thought "that would not be correct, 
with all the traveling I do ... 

45
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,195
Should feel alone. 

46
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,951
Begins to darken. 

47
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:23,029
Do you have a fourth free? 

48
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:27,604
Because ... might pass the night here? 

49
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,654
?Why? No? ?Why? No? 

50
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:31,199
Come on darling, come and sit with me. 

51
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,922
Want me to sit ... ah? 

52
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,662
Yes, yes ... 

53
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:49,683
Come on honey, do not provoke me, come

Come on, do not provoke me, sit down here? 

56
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,590
Stand. 

57
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,000
?Qu? Est? Happening? 

58
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,254
This is not what it seems. 

59
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:15,966
- Do you think funny, qu? Did you do? 
- No, he did nothing ... 

60
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,661
- Tell him. 
- It is a lie. 

61
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,499
- Qu? 
- I promised? If I had some jewelry. 

62
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,390
- Not true, say it is not true. 
- Shut up. Your call to the police. 

63
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,590
- Qu? You gonna do? 
- More. 

64
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,410
It made me put 
all this and forced me? 

65
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,155
I did that. 

66
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,507
- Qu? Kind of devil are you? 
- Look, I swear that no pas? Nothing, nothing. 

67
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:39,840
Raped me? 

68
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,742
No, no ... 

69
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:47,930
Do you know what the punishment 
for rape in this state? 

70
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:51,488
- Do not raped? 
- Qu? Think we are? 

71
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,758
Stop, qu? Est? Doing? 

72
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,882
My God. 

73
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:08,661
What mat? mat? my pap? 

74
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,237
It was not on purpose. 

75
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:16,454
Le dir? That the Sheriff 
raped me? and mat? my pap? 

76
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:21,583
What mat? the mat? 

77
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,490
So ... Where is? 

78
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:08,328
Sali? Flying tremendous 
must have taken fright. 

79
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,043
Stay away from sweets and wash my face. 

80
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,101
?Qu? We here? 

81
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:32,541
Let me see them. 

82
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,483
- Qu? Do with them? 
- Give it to me. 

83
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,456
Look what I found? 

84
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,534
- Bingo. 
- How much? 

85
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:52,698
- Close to 400. 
- Give it to me. 

86
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:55,561
- I find it? 
- Yes, but I rob? Suitcase. 

87
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,182
Then you can keep the bag. 

88
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,657
Listen bitch, I was ... 

89
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,527
I told him he should not 
take it without you. 

90
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,952
- I did, he did not. 
- Yes I did. 

91
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,731
- Get ready, kid. - No 
I did. - Yes I did. 

92
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:11,776
I did nothing, I did not ... 

93
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,084
She is? Lying 
est? hidden. 

94
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:24,256
- Qu? Have in your hand? 
- It's not my fault. 

95
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:32,843
I do not want me 
lie. You hear me? 

96
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:30,655
- Qu? We here? 
- It seems our pianist private. 

97
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,991
What is? Our little today? 

98
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,881
- It has been well since the afternoon. 
- That's good. 

99
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,341
Well, better I go. 

100
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:54,050
- Better lights. 
- Yes? 

101
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,027
If. 

102
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:01,626
- Are you coming to the table tonight? 
- I think it s? 

103
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:09,279
Gracy ... we will complete this 
home babies. You hear me? 

104
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:15,385
- Promise. 
- Did you see I have disappointed you? 

105
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,443
Good morning, madam. 

106
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,667
- Kate. 
- Hello. 

107
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:25,705
?Why? Lunch you're not going to 
your mother work? 

108
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:35,385

- Agreed. 

109
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:40,616

110
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,846
- Here we are. 
- Yes, I am not very big ... 

111
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,606
Some lights better than I have ever seen. 

112
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,480
- Good morning, Kate. 
- Good morning. 

113
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,317
Bring? These. 

114
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,204
Think you get there that rain 
we were promised? 

115
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,297
I hope so. 

116
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:08,848
- It would be nice, huh? 
- Yes, I would. 

117
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,487
It is very hot. 

118
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:17,658
No, no ... Jackson will help with that. 

119
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,059
Jackson ... 

120
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,173
He has been very dry ... 

121
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:42,718
If. 

122
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,693
Dry and warm. 

123
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:58,053
It would be good to pass 
soon ... this afternoon, maybe. 

124
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,839
Thank you. 

125
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:05,649
Hopefully you have 
reason ... on this afternoon. 

126
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,579
Choose one. 

127
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:26,794
That no. 

128
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,110
Forward. 

129
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:38,232
Watch ... I do not see it and let 
put it back in the pack 

130
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,014
bar¨¢jelas ... 

131
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,217
sufficient, 

132
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:46,979
now ... 

133
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:55,133
- Was it? 
- No. 

134
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,974
- Is this another? 
- No 

135
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:04,215
- It must be this. 
- No, sorry. 

136
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:06,685
Sometimes it does not work. 

137
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,044
- Can I? 
- Yeah, sure. 

138
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,881
And sometimes s? Works. 

139
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,421
It is this, that's the letter. 

140
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,326
- How did he do it? 
- They are late. 

141
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,179
- How much we owe? 
- Well, let me see ... 

142
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,065
As five. 

143
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,679
Look what you did. 

144
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:32,264
Ruining the dress the lady. 

145
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,757
- I am sure it is clean? 
- Sorry. 

146
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,071
It was an accident. 

147
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:40,500
Accident or not, will not 
to pay for this meal. 

148
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:43,681
- Not to be? Necessary. 
- It's the least we can do. 

149
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,132
- I insist. 
- If you insist ... 

150
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:52,110
- I suppose it is goodbye then. 
- Guess who s? 

151
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:05,401
?Why? Delay 
both? Pretty much ruined. 

152
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,065
I had to wait to return. 

153
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:13,249
- Where were you? 
- In the cemetery. 

154
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,329
Well ... if you lose late. 

155
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:26,789
- Take things out of the car. 
- Yes, sir. Now. 

156
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,279
A seven, a seven ... 

157
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,435
Seven ... 

158
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:49,082
Thanks to you, you and you ... 

159
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,530
Thanks, guys. 

160
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:55,681
Hey ... What craps?

00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:26,321
Got money? It makes no sense 
Enter Here if you do not have money. 

162
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,868

- Agreed. 

163
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:38,198
Well. 

164
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,300
To what? Waiting for? 

165
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,081
?Qu? Supposed to do with that? 

166
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:05,283
- Are you new? 
- Yes. 

167
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:07,176
Crap. 

168
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:11,430
We ... cost you? another dollar. 

169
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,370
Agreed. 

170
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,372
Watch this guy. 

171
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:34,186
Come on in here? Come on. 

172
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:41,620
?Qu? Hell? Are you 
as ladybug or something? 

173
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,962
No. 

174
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:46,555
- You must be a fag. 
- No, I am not. 

175
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,401
If you are a fag ... 

176
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:56,899
Shut up, you fucking bitch. If you do not 
shut up I swear you cut? face 

177
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,956
You understand? You know? 

178
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,730
That's good. 

179
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,625
I will remove my hand. 

180
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:10,725
You're going to keep quiet. 

181
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:19,734
I am what you said before, 
I'm a fucking fag. 

182
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:25,142
If you tell someone ... 

183
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:28,049
- No le dir? Anyone. 
- Okay. 

184
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,346
I love the place. 

185
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,676
If you imagine? I would say that. 

186
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,695
That was good. 

187
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:01,589
- Dessert? 
- Dress myself. 

188
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:04,002
- Do you mind? 
- No. 

189
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,805
Damn. 

190
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,465

191
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,629
A New Orleans. My father be? Furious. 

192
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:19,941
?Why? Is that? 

193
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,974
To begin ... empty? 
my bank account. 

194
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:27,503

expression on his face when he discovers. 

195
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:29,462

It must be your 
form or in any way.

00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:42,760
If s? Like. 

199
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,327
- What is your dessert? 
- Geneva, will you? 

200
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:58,248
Because of you. 

201
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:04,427
Damn, we have a dead soldier. 

202
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:06,817
Wait a second. 

203
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,716
My brother John ... 

204
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,436
Do you two handle this place? 

205
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:13,993
Could say that. 

206
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,934
Aqu? Take this. 

207
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:26,046
- Qu? Hell is this? 
- It's bright moon. 

208
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,750
You must see this. 

209
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:35,931
Let me see that. 

210
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:42,146
This from here? Has good boobs. 

211
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:46,447
?Qu? You know that? 

212
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,203
Usually take things. 

213
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:06,490
- A dance? 
- Yes, ma'am. 

214
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,281
- What is your name? 
- Kate. 

215
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:40,404
Hello, Kate. I'm Buster. 

216
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,608
Just ignore him. 

217
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:00,230
Give me the bottle. 

218
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:01,902
Give me the bottle. 

219
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,615
No need for that. 

220
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:14,546
I're slowing, if made 
you lose this down. 

221
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:18,115
Est ?? Something happening? 
?Qu? Est? Happening here? 

222
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,059
Nothing, only becomes a 
little crazy when drunk. 

223
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,884
Can you stop? 

224
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:26,874
For, stupid. 

225
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Anybody can tell me that 
diablos est? happening here? 

226
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:35,641
If I pay more attention to me. No 
you're the only thing that John can not avoid. 

227
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,730
He can not keep anything in place. 

228
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:41,587
Except for the letters of women. 

229
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:46,888
These letters are as close 
to be of any woman. 

230
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,729
Right, little Johnny? 

231
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:52,450
- I warn you. 
- I'm scared. 

232
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:07,815
- I warn you. 
- Now what? 

233
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:09,431
We warn you. 

234
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,156
?Why? Do that? 

235
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:30,696
- Est? Dead? 
- I think. 

236
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,063
Crazy bastard ... 

237
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,841
- John the mat? 
- It was your fault. 

238
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:42,912
My fault? Stupid motherfucker ... 

239
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:50,308
Relax. 

240
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,235
Now ... 

241
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,725
?Qu? Diablos pas? Here? 

242
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,416
- Ask. 
- No, I'm talking to you. 

243
00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:03,152
We were playing and the next thing 
s "is being thrown on the floor. 

244
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:09,482
Idiot. How many times do I have to 
not sure what to tell you to drink? 

245
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:12,366
Tell him. He was the one who brought the bottle. 

246
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,300
But you took too. 

247
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,734
I warn the two ... shut up. 

248
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,961
At least listen to his 
story? Was he alone? 

249
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,390
- Yes. 
- Are you sure? 

250
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,615
If. 

251
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:32,569
- Somebody saw it coming? 
- No, I do not think so. 

252
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,183
Do not you think? 

253
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:35,898
She does not cree. 

254
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:40,591
You better be right. I have to 
find ways to get rid of the body. 

255
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:45,473
Well, you two ... empaqu¨¦tenlo. 

256
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:48,382
Go ahead, empaqu¨¦tenlo. 

257
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:56,184
That is, this is John. 

258
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,360
Ready? 

259
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:08,365
This is? Good. I bring? 

260
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,220
Hello. 

261
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,376
Honey? 

262
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:00,850
Honey? 

263
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,251
This is the rock. 

264
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:40,899
Are not you too young to be gambling? 

265
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,584
Can I bring a drink? 

266
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,667
It seems you got lucky. 

267
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:02,473
Luck has nothing to do. 

268
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:05,074
Do you think the best? 

269
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,080
I am always win. 

270
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:10,361
- You tell your secret? 
- No har? That. 

271
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,958
They do not know how to play well. 

272
00:35:16,276 --> 00:35:18,508
- Are you police or something? 
- No. 

273
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:23,781
I just like you, I have 
a bit of pocket money. 

274
00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:25,957
Barman ... 

275
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:33,347
- How do you know where he is? 
- I've seen it many times. 

276
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:36,967
I will play in a minute 
you show? how good I am. 

277
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,604
Even they know not? 

278
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:42,521
Perhaps I have an idea 
you might be interested. 

279
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:43,596
What? 

280
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:46,365
Perhaps the two can come together. 

281
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:47,617
- Qu? 
- Yes. 

282
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:50,883
If you're as good as you say, 
I am willing to put money. 

283
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,031
So if you win ... 

284
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,779
If I win? I told him ... 

285
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:55,557
Try it. 

286
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,006
- No. 
- I thought? 

287
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,846
- Qu? 
- Forget it, son. 

288
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:05,757
My mistake. 

289
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:08,799
How much are we talking about? 

290
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:15,271
200, for starters. 

291
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,245
- Yes? 
- Yes. 

292
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:23,672
- How do you divide? 
- 60/40. You are 40. 

293
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:28,480
?Qu? You say? 

294
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,135
I guess. 

295
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:41,888
Who has eyes 
faster than my hands? 

296
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:48,450
$ 200 I can say. 

297
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:53,338
Agreed. 

298
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,597
This Ah? 

299
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,930
That is? Well. 

300
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,302
Bet you can not do it again. 

301
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,271
?Double or nothing? 

302
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,580
- This. 
- Are you here for? 

303
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,436
Are you sure? 

304
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:50,104
Go. 

305
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,014

306
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,974

S what? that is not pas? deb? wrong. 

308
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:05,416
Missed, with my money. 

309
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,343
I said I was sorry. 

310
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:18,430
I do not understand. 

311
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:23,088
Honey, We gave a tremendous blow today. 

312
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,415
- We? I dress everything. 
- Bullshit. 

313
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,586
Enter. 

314
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:37,014
- I do not want to meddle in anything. 
- No, we are here? 

315
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:41,505
Kate, would you mind 
bring two drinks? 

316
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:51,750
So ... How was everything today? 

317
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:54,166
Gan? Lot.

00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:56,265
It was great, pap? Great. 

319
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:58,660
You were not so bad, kid. 

320
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,631
Are you always so easy? 

321
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,847
These blocks are only 
timadas be praying for. 

322
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:09,817
Here is? Yours. 

323
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,893
- And my slice?

324
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,687
- My slice. 
- Is your slice? 

325
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:21,788
If I put something like that. If the 
gets a slice, do what? I do not? 

326
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,514
Well ...

Here is? Yours.

00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,209
- For the apples. 
- For the apples. 

331
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:52,043
For apples.

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,590
You can not dishonorable. 

333
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:16,855
Not to do it again ... 

334
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:22,879
I'm going to kill. 

335
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:24,687

00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,347

- Calm down, you two. 
- Shut up. 

339
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:02,096

341

Get lost. 

343
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:20,605
I think he knew he was being scammed. 

344
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:23,013
It seemed it was going to relax ... 

345
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:26,799

butter in the July 4. 

346

- Good shot.

347
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:41,900
You should do it more often. 

348
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:45,185
- Qu? 
- Smile. 

349
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:48,937
Wasting your time. 

350
00:42:52,222 --> 00:42:56,211
- Do not fall very well, right? 
- Not much. 

351
00:42:56,442 --> 00:43:00,456
Est? Well, you do not have to be 
careful with my feelings or anything. 

352
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,703
- I do not understand. 
- Qu? 

353
00:43:09,404 --> 00:43:11,515
?Qu? 

354
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,847
?Why? You have to be rude? 

355
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:19,155
Only pens? We could be friends. 

356
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:23,661
Friends? That is? Well. 

357
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:29,629
You think that because we do a couple of scams 
together, perhaps I can do one to me? 

358
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:31,549
I think much. 

359
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:34,597
Look, you go, you're inside ... 

360
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:38,760
Search? How to deal with that, 
but that is as far from likely. 

361
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,770
Has your work and I har? Mine. 

362
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,445
Agreed. 

363
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,266
Still I like your smile. 

364
00:44:18,968 --> 00:44:20,297
Not have to go, right? 

365
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,026
Not yet. 

366
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:25,228
Where are you supposed to? 

367
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,508
Business. 

368
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:34,324
- Ever wondered where to go? 
- Do not speak of it, remember? 

369
00:44:44,037 --> 00:44:46,596
Do not you wish we could stay as? 

370
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:54,040
- Or go somewhere nice? 
- Yes. 

371
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:58,506
- Yes? 
- Sure. 

372
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,684
- Qu? Doing? 
- I saw. 

373
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:09,106
You are playing with me, right? 

374
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:12,738
- You know how it is? 
- Sure. 

375
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,878
Do not think I would 
that things were different? 

376
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:24,157
For now, things have 
to be as? OK? 

377
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:29,773
Go, go ... 

378
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:53,226
- Where have you been? 
- On the River. 

379
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:58,005
It was hot, I could not sleep. 

380
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:01,991
- Can you sleep now? 
- I think. 

381
00:46:02,784 --> 00:46:06,933
I've been 
feeling a bit tired. 

382
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:09,284
- Do you want me warm milk? 
- Will you do that for me? 

383
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:11,219
You know that. 

384
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,701
Let me olerte. 

385
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:21,967
I like the way you smell, honey. 

386
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:27,687
?Qu? You say? A little? 

387
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,675
Grace ... 

388
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:00,856
Do you think we have been so horrible? 

389
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,839
You and me ... To punish us as? 

390
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:06,943
Do not talk as? 

391
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,133
- So, why what? 
- No s? 

392
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:17,078
That picnic ... that was the 
first time I kissed. 

393
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:19,308
I got home ... 

394
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:29,360
Your pap? Told me that if 
I do not start to kill me. 

395
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:34,574
I told him that I marry 
you in any way. 

396
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,053
And as? Have 10 kids ... 

397
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:44,976
chubby ... and gorditas. 

398
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,696
- Is it my fault? 
- No, Jackson. 

399
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:56,620
Do not you deserve, it is true ... 

400
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:02,293
but if I love you, Grace. 

401
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:12,154
Although we do not have 
No Child ... te amar? 

402
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:22,627
Where did you learn this trick? 

403
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:25,219
In Miami. 

404
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:28,609
- Yes, have you been ah? 
- No, I never ido. 

405
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,811
The place is? So many places 
desperate to play for you. 

406
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,858
Someone comes ... seems to go alone. 

407
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,575
Let's go. 

408
00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:05,530
Now I'm going. 

409
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:11,373
- We could use a cup of caf? 
- Yes, a caf? Be great. 

410
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:20,814
Thank you. 

411
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:27,197
We have chicken, beef and I think 
we have a piece of lemon cake. 

412
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:29,388
Take? Lemon cake. 

413
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:32,238
- Has a lot on the road? 
- A couple of days ... 

414
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:34,120
... a couple of days. 

415
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:38,060
- S? What you mean. 
- I diversion? Somewhere ... 

416
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:39,706
- Where to go? 
- Little Rock. 

417
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:42,772
If you are distracted? Somewhere. 

418
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:44,906
I can teach in a map if you wish. 

419
00:50:45,123 --> 00:50:46,467
Great, thanks. 

420
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:52,193
Now it serves. 

421
00:50:56,884 --> 00:50:58,260
What is? 

422
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:03,613
- Qu? Is this? Is yours? 
- No. 

423
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:07,592
Find? It on the floor ... 

424
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,024
Stingy. 

425
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:18,316
- That's a lot of money. 
- No identification. 

426
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:21,656
Because a client? Quit, 
was an hour ago. 

427
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:28,371
- Qu? Do with this? 
- I should give it to her. 

428
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:35,682
?Why? The mine is so 
money as theirs, or yours. 

429
00:51:36,257 --> 00:51:38,116
Whoever finds it is. 

430
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,568
If anyone finds it is. 

431
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,168
We can split it. 

432
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:46,709
?Qu? You say? I do not think they come back. 

433
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:49,599
It is my? Well. 

434
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:53,091
We can wait until ... midnight. 

435
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,376
I guess it would be fair. 

436
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:57,449
Who is it then? 

437
00:51:57,924 --> 00:52:00,054
Well ... I find it? 

438
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,611
No deal. 

439
00:52:01,982 --> 00:52:03,905
?Why? Not you care? 

440
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,599
Wait ... do not know. 

441
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:10,340
Do not take offense but not the 
you know, either. 

442
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,012
Well ... Where to go anyway? 

443
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:19,982
- One second, I have an idea. 
- I bet it is. 

444
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:25,046
I have $ 100 here? 
we can all put 100. 

445
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:29,881
- That's a lot of money. 
- It's just to make sure. 

446
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:33,356
- I do not understand. 
- Do I have to explain? 

447
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:39,574
I think that means that if we all have 
an interest ... we all have an interest. 

448
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:42,648
If ... WHAT? Is the worst that could happen? 

449
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:46,494
The back and retrieve my $ 100. 

450
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:53,129
Yes, but if he does not return ... everyone 
are $ 100 richer. 

451
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:57,133
Perhaps it was not so bad 
diversion after all. 

452
00:52:57,384 --> 00:52:58,833
Maybe. 

453
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:04,650
Put here? What will? 
up for all to see. 

454
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,318
No one touches it until midnight. 

455
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:09,556
- Okay. 
- Okay. 

456
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,815
Wake up, went with the money. 

457
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,667
I went up and when 
regras? was ido. 

458
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:27,092
- It was my savings. 
- I knew it was not trustworthy. 

459
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,033
- Qu? Har? Now? 
- Where she was told. 

460
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,080
To the west, I guess to Kansas City. 

461
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:41,011
Maybe I can reach it, can not be 
so far only have a couple of minutes. 

462
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:46,561
If you reached, I promise you 
mandar? every penny of your money. 

463
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,010
- S? It har? I trust you. 
- I promise. 

464
00:53:49,253 --> 00:53:51,198
Hurry up. Hurry up. 

465
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:51,641
- I told you never camest. 
- I did not. 

466
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:54,810
?Qu? Do you think I am 
a comemierda or ...? 

467
00:54:55,398 --> 00:54:58,759
S? S and what you did? With 
who were. Now listen to me. 

468
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,533
- Did you lose your virginity? 
- No. 

469
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,330
- No? 
- No, oh no, 

470
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:04,427
were only a couple of kisses. 

471
00:55:04,664 --> 00:55:06,069
Oh, a couple of kisses. 

472
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:11,115
You give? All you want. 

473
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:13,576
Now, sit down. 

474
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:16,116
You went t? Who went to see? 

475
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,008
Have you been with him behind my back? 

476
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:19,674
No. 

477
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:21,707
Gosh, it's over and over again. 

478
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:27,178
- Do you mamaste cock? 
- Qu? 

479
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:28,589
I said if you mamaste cock. 

480
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:30,171
I noticed that. 

481
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,868
Oh, s? Y. .. How is that? 

482
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,624
Tell me how that works? 

483
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:36,423
How does that? 

484
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:41,346
Well, first no dej? That 
too close. Hell, that s what I? 

485
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:42,636
Good for m? 

486
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:44,006
Why what? Is that? 

487
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:45,218
Because ... 

488
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:50,102
- Why? 
- Because when you get too close to a boy ... 

489
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,705
... there comes a time 
you do not know what to do. 

490
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:52,877
S? 

491
00:55:53,623 --> 00:55:56,084
And you can lose your virginity, 
and that can finish everything. 

492
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:00,460
As? Is. 

493
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:03,196
There is one more thing. 

494
00:56:06,164 --> 00:56:06,908
If ever ... 

495
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:09,179

496
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,300
s not? what har? my wrist. 

497
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:16,961
That was clear? 

498
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,258
Well. 

499
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:24,539
Now get out of here? 
look like shit. 

500
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:18,535
Can I come in? 

501
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:20,807
Come, come. 

502
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:24,392
?Hard Day? 

503
00:57:24,629 --> 00:57:25,335
You can secure it. 

504
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:28,890
?Qu? Te pas? In the eye? 

505
00:57:29,281 --> 00:57:30,376
I found a door. 

506
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:41,156
If we are going to start lying you can do 
stories of all kinds, qu? think? 

507
00:57:41,898 --> 00:57:42,641
Thank you. 

508
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,431
How long have you been off? 

509
00:57:48,463 --> 00:57:49,403
Since I was 13. 

510
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:51,667
Did you at any time? 

511
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:53,543
S? ?T? 

512
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:55,107
Why what? What would you do? 

513
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:57,842
I have to qu? Live, remember? 

514
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,890
Who are you working for? 

515
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,195
No way. 

516
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:04,370
No te lo dir? 

517
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:06,836
Think I am some sort of silly. 

518
00:58:07,228 --> 00:58:07,856
Do you? 

519
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:09,262
Good argument. 

520
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,812
Why? Not serve me 
another and perhaps tell you. 

521
00:58:22,742 --> 00:58:23,605
He had a companion 

522
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,480
did a couple of plays together 

523
00:58:28,653 --> 00:58:31,039
could not with that head. 

524
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,852
Is that a smile? 

525
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:42,722
We had a crazy game in Texas. 

526
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:47,644
It was a bit risky 
someone was very respectable. 

527
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:51,086
And the girls were very pretty. 

528
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:56,909
We used to do was to 
followed the rodeo in town, 

529
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:05,347
when I saw the cowboy love drinking, 
spend their earnings more in girls than in anything else. 

530
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,810
As? It was an easy job. 

531
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,952
We found one, 
form the strategy. 

532
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:18,557
He was sent "in a corner with a guitar, 
and said that the strings were bad. 

533
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,002
Does your partner? 

534
00:59:22,628 --> 00:59:23,604
One night in particular, 

535
00:59:24,737 --> 00:59:27,629
wine boasting a cowboy, 

536
00:59:28,762 --> 00:59:33,684
was wasting the money everywhere 
and I could see the finished work ... 

537
00:59:34,623 --> 00:59:36,381
... because the type was very bad. 

538
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:39,467
Then my companion intent? 
make contact with him y. .. 

539
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:43,805
... swear to God that virtually 
we were handed. 

540
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,369
And then what? 

541
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:47,477
Good, 

542
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:48,728
then what? 

543
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:53,889
The time to complete? continue 
to a rodeo wrong. 

544
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:56,747
Our cowboy era ... 

545
00:59:58,153 --> 00:59:59,017
... a Texas Ranger. 

546
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:01,831
That hurts. 

547
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:06,089
Imagine how hurt 
10 months in prison. 

548
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:09,217
All the time behind bars. 

549
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:11,561
?Qu? Me tell your partner? 

550
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:14,921
That, well, ah follow? 

551
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,539
I follow? Doing it again. 

552
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:21,601
Have you thought about leaving? 

553
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,023
Sure, I did. 

554
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:25,982
Me too. 

555
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:28,091
As did my mam? 

556
01:00:28,756 --> 01:00:29,772
- Does she know? 
- S? 

557
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:32,155
One day, she dej? Around and left. 

558
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:35,009
- S? 
- A long time ago. 

559
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:37,788
Do not remember. 

560
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,349
I can not remember his face. 

561
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:42,145
Just remember ... 

562
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,000
I remember the dress I had, 

563
01:00:45,626 --> 01:00:47,384

564
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:50,978
and I remember her perfume 

565
01:00:54,728 --> 01:00:55,822
No blame. 

566
01:00:58,518 --> 01:01:00,119
And then, qu? About you? 

567
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:01,763
- Why? ... No? 
- Will I? 

568
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:07,504
Well, firstly, 
money is too good. 

569
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:10,830
Have you ever tried the long way? 

570
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,020
No, no, that's not for me? 

571
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:16,497
That sounds too 
m risky and I like ... 

572
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:19,154
... move a little. 

573
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:25,560
Why what? Still here? 

574
01:01:27,943 --> 01:01:29,193
Are you gonna ask me that? 

575
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:36,736
Listen, 

576
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,688
you do not want to mix with me. 

577
01:01:40,018 --> 01:01:41,540
- There are things that happen ... 
- Lo s? 

578
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,277
- Do not know anything. 
- Is that the doors do not have cuffs. 

579
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:48,223
- Gu¨¢rdatelo, I do not cry. 
- S? s? do. 

580
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:52,832
Oh, I think that 
m going to dramatize? 

581
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:54,982
If I leave, s? 

582
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,094
But I've heard this 
conversation before. 

583
01:01:57,602 --> 01:01:58,541
No m? 

584
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:03,109
?Qu? Makes you so different? 

585
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:06,978
T? 

586
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,985
Sweet talk and promises.

S? Involved 
this whole conversation. 

588
01:02:15,847 --> 01:02:17,528
but s? not har? reality. 

589
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:18,779
pru¨¦bame. 

590
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:25,223
Do not cry. 

591
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:36,392
- Good morning. 
- Good morning. 

592
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:38,350

593
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:40,420
Kate. 

594
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:47,692
- Listen, about last night. 
- Forget about last night. 

595
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,263
- What qu? Is this? 
- Last night was a mistake. 

596
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:56,834
An error. 

597
01:02:57,381 --> 01:02:58,320
Is that what it was for you? 

598
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:02,500
Well, it was not for me? 

599
01:03:02,853 --> 01:03:03,949
Well, that's your problem. 

600
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:09,692
?Qu? Tell me of our 
conversation, Kate? 

601
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:11,841
When you do not joder¨ªas 
the time was suitable. 

602
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:14,459
Were they just words? 

603
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:18,485
What were they? Were they just words, Kate? 

604
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:20,322
people say many things. 

605
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:23,956
Mira, 

606
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:25,753
when I go ... 

607
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:29,739
... not to be? with t as a con artist? 

608
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:33,215
T? And I have no future. 

609
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:34,466
You hear me? 

610
01:03:37,554 --> 01:03:39,194
S? I did. 

611
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:50,763
No, no, do not do it. 

612
01:04:21,302 --> 01:04:22,159
I said you did. 

613
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,857
?Why? Ruin it 
everything? Stupid bitch. 

614
01:04:26,068 --> 01:04:26,772
I hate you. 

615
01:04:56,695 --> 01:04:57,163
Wait. 

616
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:58,727
- Why? 
- We need to talk. 

617
01:04:59,120 --> 01:04:59,978
Okay, I hear you. 

618
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,732
You said once that you want 
we could be together forever. 

619
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:06,741
S? I do not remember when. 

620
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:07,641
I said. 

621
01:05:08,814 --> 01:05:09,322
Agreed. 

622
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:11,237
?Qu? Say ... 

623
01:05:12,137 --> 01:05:15,144
... if we forget about everything 
this and we 're out of here? 

624
01:05:17,568 --> 01:05:19,718
- What qu? Talking about? 
- To go from here? 

625
01:05:21,006 --> 01:05:22,218
What I want to ask ... 

626
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:24,095
... is ... 

627
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:28,903
- ... Do you would go with me? 
- Are you gonna let get away with it? 

628
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:34,659
- I'm afraid. 
- Are you going to do that? 

629
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:43,175
I can not believe. 

630
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:48,255
- If I gave you that impression, sorry. 
- Printing? 

631
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:51,341
I mean, I did not want to hurt her. 

632
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:53,803
but m? s? 

633
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,501
She is my wife. 

634
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:57,831
And what am I? 

635
01:05:58,884 --> 01:05:59,317
?Qu? 

636
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,543
- Come on. 
- I can say. 

637
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:03,382
You knew when we started. 

638
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,854
- T? Only ... 
- Whenever people have used me 

639
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:15,614
- For one thing or another. 
- Well, that's not fair. 

640
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:17,534
You feel good too. 

641
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:21,713
This time board? That would be different. 

642
01:06:22,457 --> 01:06:23,435
It was. 

643
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:24,917
Things change. 

644
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:29,574
Some things. 

645
01:06:30,122 --> 01:06:30,630
No. .. 

646
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:42,456
Are you sure that you do not mind? 

647
01:06:42,924 --> 01:06:43,863
Oh, of course not. 

648
01:06:44,645 --> 01:06:47,615
Looks better on you and 
m? me is longer. 

649
01:06:48,982 --> 01:06:51,365
Oh, Grace, I am so happy for you. 

650
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:53,906
thanks. 

651
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,251
I feel good about this. 

652
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:58,792
Really it s? 

653
01:06:59,574 --> 01:07:00,432
And me too. 

654
01:07:03,325 --> 01:07:05,668
It seems that there is a 
storm, it is better that I go. 

655
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:09,892
- Take care, bye. 
- Bye. 

656
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:16,377
Oh, Jackson. 

657
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,065
Oh, Jackson. 

658
01:08:00,596 --> 01:08:01,300
?Grace? 

659
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:04,738
Hello, Jackson.

?Qu? Doing? 

661

?Qu? Happens? 

662
01:08:09,076 --> 01:08:11,303
Oh, we were alone. 

663
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,728
- You know, to visit. 
- Qu? 

664
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:16,192
you know, the normal tour. 

665
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:21,507
Because I imagine that your wife 
wonder where you are. 

666
01:08:22,405 --> 01:08:23,226
?Qu? 

667
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:24,399

01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:37,795
Has been completed. 

673
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:39,358
That is listening? 

674
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:41,079
?Why? Doing this? 

675
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:44,557
Is that I upset? When I enter? 

676
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:46,862
Where were you? 

677
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:48,700
Damn.

S? you will. 

685
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:05,433
Maybe your wife wants to listen 
my version of history. 

686
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:08,326
Want? 

687
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:11,179
Want? 

688
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:14,422

Do what? Is this?

01:09:15,437 --> 01:09:17,979
Leave now, is it? Expecting a baby? 

690
01:09:18,332 --> 01:09:21,419
Oh, that's so sweet. 

691
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,450
We are waiting. 

692
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,014
Oh, God. 

693
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:36,975

I've been in one place. 

696
01:09:48,032 --> 01:09:49,048
You've been in one place. 

697
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:52,760
With someone. 

698
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,597
Have you been in a place with someone? 

699
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,057
S? 

700
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:00,417
Tell with whom. 

701
01:10:02,488 --> 01:10:04,248
I have been with Kate. 

702
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:05,538
?Qu? 

703
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:07,374
?Qu? 

704
01:10:08,274 --> 01:10:09,095
Sorry. 

705
01:10:09,798 --> 01:10:10,698
Oh, God. 

706
01:10:11,596 --> 01:10:12,573
Oh, God. 

707
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:15,549
There was no need for this. 

708
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,402
S? good pens? s that? needed. 

709
01:10:24,146 --> 01:10:26,609
I understand your pathetic scene, 

710
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:28,216
but, 

711
01:10:30,013 --> 01:10:32,123
I am not for this. 

712
01:10:34,626 --> 01:10:35,645
Come on, John. 

713
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,162
No, no, no, no please. 

714
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:32,067
Let her calm. 

715
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:41,355
I want ... 

716
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:45,620
S not? Find where the nerves 
to show your face on here? 

717
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:47,342
?Qu? 

718
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,842
I've done this, Gracy. 

719
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:53,383
We know what you did. 

720
01:13:54,594 --> 01:13:57,017
Things that made my 
sister and her husband separated. 

721
01:13:57,798 --> 01:13:59,949
It was cruel what he did your father. 

722
01:14:00,654 --> 01:14:03,311
And anyone who ever urban? 
anyone in his entire life. 

723
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:05,890
I hope you are satisfied. 

724
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,658
?Qu? Is what's wrong? 

725
01:14:23,518 --> 01:14:24,963
I think it is not me 
I like to spy. 

726
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,875
A m? Not like I lie. 

727
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:31,260
I told you I was over. 

728
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:32,823
S? Indeed, 

729
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,558
but only two of you 
go through a long cold 

730
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:38,686
as? I believe that 
final, you're smart. 

731
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:41,109
I did not have to do that. 

732
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:42,986
pens? he deserved it. 

733
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,539
- Revolver water. 
- No, t? Did. 

734
01:14:46,907 --> 01:14:48,664
I told you away 
him, was not it as? 

735
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:50,345
Te advert? 

736
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:52,299
S? 

737
01:14:52,768 --> 01:14:53,550
I noticed. 

738
01:14:55,703 --> 01:14:56,719
It could have been ... 

739
01:14:57,463 --> 01:14:59,142
... only a couple of kisses. 

740
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:04,417
Perhaps t .. you fell in love. 

741
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:06,803
No. 

742
01:15:08,874 --> 01:15:09,969
Then it was a cow. 

743
01:15:10,126 --> 01:15:11,767
Everybody hates me now. 

744
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:13,919
Oh, I break your heart. 

745
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:17,201
With your big event, go, 

746
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:21,304
he never cares? 
what others think. 

747
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:24,157
And since when t? Have heart? 

748
01:15:26,696 --> 01:15:28,689
Would be wise if we put 
Considering that this is good for you. 

749
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:33,847
?Why? Never talk about it? 

750
01:15:37,714 --> 01:15:38,692
Why what? What would you do? 

751
01:15:40,137 --> 01:15:41,349
I have a right to know. 

752
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,535
All you need to know ... 

753
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:48,548
... is it you dej? 

754
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:50,855
End of story. 

755
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,802
But that is not the end 
of history, is not it as? 

756
01:15:57,462 --> 01:15:58,440
?Qu? You mean? 

757
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,746
Were never able to let go. 

758
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,558
Say what you did. 

759
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:04,770
No. 

760
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:06,609
I think you should. 

761
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:08,289
I did nothing. 

762
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:10,790
And then what? As you have? 

763
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:12,355
I'm not as? 

764
01:16:14,313 --> 01:16:17,833
Is it because the double cross is? 
choking in your throat like nothing? 

765
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,616
?Qu? Is what happens you lately? 

766
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,054
I'm just curious to 
my mother, that's all. 

767
01:16:32,406 --> 01:16:33,228
Why what? Is that? 

768
01:16:34,635 --> 01:16:36,120
She was a bitch. 

769
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:38,543
Never you mind? A 
fuck any of us. 

770
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,069
Is that what you wanted to hear, baby? 

771
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:47,686
Because that is what pas? 

772
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:56,046
Not talk about that change? Nothing. 

773
01:17:00,069 --> 01:17:02,023
No change? Nothing. 

774
01:17:09,253 --> 01:17:10,112
Maybe. 

775
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:28,305
I think this needs our help. 

776
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:34,322
Hello. 

777
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:35,536
Need a hand? 

778
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:36,865
S? thanks. 

779
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,374
What seems to be the problem? 

780
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:45,970
S not? just me dej? here? 

781
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:49,409
Do you mind if my son 
you take a look? 

782
01:17:50,193 --> 01:17:51,522
No, not at all, go ahead. 

783
01:17:51,559 --> 01:17:52,719
Agreed. 

784
01:18:08,269 --> 01:18:08,939
S not? 

785
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:11,283
I think it could be the starter. 

786
01:18:12,885 --> 01:18:14,449
?Qu? Said if we give it a ride? 

787
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:17,773
And then I can bring the truck 
up here? to collect the car. 

788
01:18:18,436 --> 01:18:19,219
We thank? 

789
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:22,659
Hugh Babcock. 

790
01:18:23,127 --> 01:18:23,947
Holy shit, 

791
01:18:24,145 --> 01:18:25,631
William, William Bender. 

792
01:18:26,023 --> 01:18:27,352
And this is my son John. 

793
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,799
- Hi John. 
- Hello. 

794
01:18:29,113 --> 01:18:29,855
Pleased to meet you. 

795
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:33,530
Let me get my suitcase. If I could 
phone call, Mr Bender, 

796
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:35,090
in my business, 

797
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:39,154
- ... timeliness is critical. 
- Qu? Business is that? 

798
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,578
Capital. Have you ever been 
in the market, Mr. Bender? 

799
01:18:41,735 --> 01:18:42,712
No. 

800
01:18:50,552 --> 01:18:51,650
Oh, thanks. 

801
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:04,677
I assure you, Mr. Addams, who just found a 
Excellent gain with another customer for the same investment. 

802
01:19:05,498 --> 01:19:06,244
S? sir. 

803
01:19:06,795 --> 01:19:07,653
Everything is "in its place. 

804
01:19:08,396 --> 01:19:08,947
S? 

805
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:13,714
S? but I must remind you that the success of 
the adventure lies in our actions. 

806
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:15,980
Well, really need 
to commit itself today. 

807
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,203
But that is why we already 
I gave a week to think. 

808
01:19:24,266 --> 01:19:25,946
S? est? good guess ... 

809
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:28,135
... you give? up 
tomorrow morning. 

810
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:30,129
I do not move? sir, do not try to stop ... 

811
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,294
50 thousand dollars ... 
I go out of their hands. 

812
01:19:34,622 --> 01:19:35,638
S? sir. 

813
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:37,711
Okay, so 
tomorrow morning. 

814
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:43,234
?Qu? Tell me something for dinner? 

815
01:19:47,493 --> 01:19:49,330
Do not go amiss. 

816
01:19:49,838 --> 01:19:50,464
Ok. 

817
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:56,521
I was very lucky 
meet with you. 

818
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,336
Did you make your call right? 

819
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:04,303
S? sir, but what was 
saying, business plans ... 

820
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:08,132
The words are tangled. 

821
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:09,972
Pardon? 

822
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:11,614
What I mean is ... 

823
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:16,186
... sometimes the plans 
we are going overboard, 

824
01:20:17,006 --> 01:20:19,702
and believe that everything 
lost, and then, 

825
01:20:21,382 --> 01:20:26,224
turn around, and a better plan 
falls right in front of us. 

826
01:20:26,694 --> 01:20:27,827
That's why I am here? 

827
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:32,008
S? Not seem to be much, 
but this is not the whole story. 

828
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,509
Oh, he does not want to hear that. 

829
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:35,724
Oh, sure s? 

830
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,180
Well, when I was young 
me one? to the army. 

831
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,627
Right in front of the battlefield. 

832
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:45,698
Now, once that was ah? 

833
01:20:46,128 --> 01:20:48,355
knows? with a soldier 
the name of Tom McGrew. 

834
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:53,590
Well, we used to talk about our plans, 
things we would do after the war, 

835
01:20:55,036 --> 01:20:57,068
and told him "of my dream. 

836
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,964
That some day come. 

837
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:03,598
Well, Tom had a lot of money. 

838
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:09,732
His family was rich, but I was 
part of some farmers in Mississippi. 

839
01:21:11,686 --> 01:21:13,835
And one night, there was an ambush 

840
01:21:15,632 --> 01:21:16,809
and Tom 

841
01:21:18,216 --> 01:21:19,426
was wounded. 

842
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:22,202
It hurt a lot. 

843
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,002
Much. 

844
01:21:24,161 --> 01:21:25,412
I can assure. 

845
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:27,094
I could not leave ah? To die. 

846
01:21:27,797 --> 01:21:29,243
He was a friend of the Army. 

847
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:36,743
But I did what everyone would do and what cargu? Through 
the crossfire of the Regiment to the other side. 

848
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:41,745
And Tom, muri? Fair ah? In my arms. 

849
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:44,964
He would have done the same for m? 

850
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:48,206
Either way, 

851
01:21:48,794 --> 01:21:50,981
after the war, came back? home and 

852
01:21:51,686 --> 01:21:54,529
one days appeared? a man 
on my doorstep with a letter. 

853
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:58,202
- And in it was the right ...

854
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:04,414

a check with 50 thousand dollars. 

855
01:22:05,197 --> 01:22:06,095

856
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:08,870
As? Is 

857
01:22:09,769 --> 01:22:11,527

858
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:16,802
How do you feel? 

859
01:22:17,038 --> 01:22:21,338
Think you have a dream? I 
I feel like in a dream, Mr. Babcock?

So is your friend? Sick. 

865

Dying is better.

He owns 5000 shares 
International oil. 

867
01:22:42,855 --> 01:22:43,953
Is that much? 

868
01:22:44,111 --> 01:22:45,282
Substantially enough.

01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:08,813
Not that I do not care, 

876
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:11,392
but the man is "in his bed 
Death has no relatives. 

877
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:16,978
Look, I'm crazy to take advantage of 
a dying person, but I am not a bad man. 

878
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,363
I'm as good as 
next to it, honestly. 

879
01:23:20,653 --> 01:23:22,058
But hell, this is gold. 

880
01:23:27,528 --> 01:23:29,247
I like to see an animal, William. 

881
01:23:30,225 --> 01:23:31,748
But WHAT? do in this situation? 

882
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:37,453
Well, I think it's time for 
let this thought animal. 

883
01:23:38,391 --> 01:23:41,008
S? insurance have many customers. 

884
01:23:42,141 --> 01:23:42,923
This is not the time. 

885
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:45,391
I see him tomorrow. 

886
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:49,611
- It's not the end of the world. 
- But it is. 

887
01:23:52,269 --> 01:23:53,597
I probably will not tell you this. 

888
01:23:55,473 --> 01:23:56,332
But the fact is 

889
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:58,717
that dej? one 
my clients agree. 

890
01:24:00,826 --> 01:24:01,920
S? Not deb? Do, 

891
01:24:02,703 --> 01:24:03,798
would return the money. 

892
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:06,066
Honestly I was gonna do. 

893
01:24:07,863 --> 01:24:08,685
Here. 

894
01:24:19,314 --> 01:24:20,369
Sorry. 

895
01:24:20,648 --> 01:24:21,509
Est? Well. 

896
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,189
- Sorry. 
- No, est? Well. 

897
01:24:30,377 --> 01:24:31,590
What I would ... 

898
01:24:32,176 --> 01:24:32,842
No. 

899
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,342
Not unless you want to buy. 

900
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:39,099
How much? 

901
01:24:39,842 --> 01:24:40,899
?Qu? 

902
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:46,170
Well, after so many years, 
I have saved enough. 

903
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:50,155
I think it is time 
I get to work. 

904
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:51,758
Are you serious. 

905
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:53,049
S not? To say. 

906
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:56,705
Well, hell, I have to 
know this man first. 

907
01:24:57,604 --> 01:25:01,161
Perhaps a farmer 
I am not a fool. 

908
01:25:01,473 --> 01:25:02,646
No problem, we can fix. 

909
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:08,390
Wait, let me warn you, this 
type est? sick, does not smell good. 

910
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:09,641
Toast to the future. 

911
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:11,087
Okay, for our future. 

912
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,140
Sorry, sir ... 

913
01:25:23,391 --> 01:25:25,032
What did you say your name was? 

914
01:25:25,891 --> 01:25:26,556
William Bender. 

915
01:25:28,902 --> 01:25:29,644
Is Mr. Bender. 

916
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,732
Remember? It is the man? 
interested in buying its oil. 

917
01:25:34,293 --> 01:25:35,271
As? Is. 

918
01:25:39,571 --> 01:25:42,386
What do you consider a fair price? 

919
01:25:44,188 --> 01:25:47,079
Mr. Bender finds 
offer $ 550. 

920
01:25:52,276 --> 01:25:53,175
Not much. 

921
01:25:55,676 --> 01:25:56,769
Well, no, sir, is not. 

922
01:25:57,515 --> 01:25:59,001
But it is more than you have now. 

923
01:26:00,526 --> 01:26:03,808
Well, I can not bear with me. 

924
01:26:15,255 --> 01:26:20,020
I never had much luck with the market, 
really hope it does better. 

925
01:26:22,442 --> 01:26:27,014
These fingers have arthritis, 
if you could guide my hand. 

926
01:26:27,915 --> 01:26:28,538
S? sir. 

927
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:29,869
Help me. 

928
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:30,926
S? 

929
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,900
Henry Addams. 

930
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,601
- With two D. 
- Two D? 

931
01:26:47,657 --> 01:26:48,516
Thank you. 

932
01:27:09,686 --> 01:27:10,823
Is that the ah? 

933
01:27:12,739 --> 01:27:14,534
Started to fall in any 
time from now. 

934
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:17,626
Are you sure about this? 

935
01:27:17,663 --> 01:27:18,517
S? just look. 

936
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:20,119
This is? Full of speculators. 

937
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:26,103
All? Go. 

938
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:27,745
Sell when it reaches 6. 

939
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:43,472
Time to sell. 

940
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:18,938
This type is "in the scams. 

941
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:22,415
- You are crazy. 
- Am I? 

942
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:25,855
S? pap? I know. 

943
01:28:26,753 --> 01:28:28,044
S? maybe. 

944
01:28:29,568 --> 01:28:31,405
Or maybe it is? Trying 
to tell your employer. 

945
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:33,827
Find out what? Ago. 

946
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,196
No. 

947
01:28:35,356 --> 01:28:39,459
So tell me, when was the 
last job? without us? 

948
01:28:42,002 --> 01:28:43,214
- No s? 
- Never. 

949
01:28:44,503 --> 01:28:45,990
So now he makes the play, 

950
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:47,669
is a large one. 

951
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:49,473
Get your record. 

952
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:53,262
T? And I received nothing. 

953
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:54,982
We do not see anything. 

954
01:28:57,015 --> 01:28:58,812
If you ask me, te dir? That sucks. 

955
01:29:00,844 --> 01:29:04,086
- S? it is? rare. 
- Exactly. 

956
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:07,447
Only that you will not receive anything. 

957
01:29:08,618 --> 01:29:09,287
Neither I nor. 

958
01:29:11,046 --> 01:29:13,391
We will not do anything 
and also that he knows it. 

959
01:29:14,678 --> 01:29:16,829
We let a couple, 
That is what we are. 

960
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:18,196
It's a bastard. 

961
01:29:20,697 --> 01:29:22,338
S just maybe? Should 
do something about it. 

962
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,833
Perhaps it is time to protect 
our interests for a change. 

963
01:29:28,828 --> 01:29:30,389
- How? 
- No s? 

964
01:29:32,812 --> 01:29:33,477
but I must know. 

965
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:35,825
I know now 
same if you're me. 

966
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:38,288
S? s? 

967
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:40,047
You have to rely on m? 

968
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:42,627
He can not know. 

969
01:29:44,661 --> 01:29:45,640
So, are you with me? 

970
01:29:45,796 --> 01:29:46,739
S? s told you? 

971
01:29:48,146 --> 01:29:49,396
Well. 

972
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:53,223
As? Is 

973
01:29:53,809 --> 01:29:55,450
But does not work? Yesterday? 

974
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:58,615
- S? but ... 
- This is not much difference. 

975
01:29:59,123 --> 01:30:00,920
A piece and put it back. 

976
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,519
Look, if I'd helped yesterday 

977
01:30:05,185 --> 01:30:06,044
were trickster. 

978
01:30:07,766 --> 01:30:08,899
I want to do this for you, William. 

979
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:12,690
Hey, for ah? Comes Kate, why 
qu? not you ask her? 

980
01:30:13,237 --> 01:30:16,598
- Qu? Occurs here? 
- Okay, just listen to him. 

981
01:30:17,927 --> 01:30:21,213
There is another offer, it is our 
opportunity to make lots of money. 

982
01:30:21,956 --> 01:30:24,027
Your father and was close to that, 

983
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:28,521
and I am not wrong, because s? that money 
is easier than it is on this day. 

984
01:30:29,225 --> 01:30:30,709
But this is great. 

985
01:30:33,289 --> 01:30:36,493
agree, what I propose 
is that together our resources 

986
01:30:36,884 --> 01:30:37,626
and go for it. 

987
01:30:38,253 --> 01:30:40,401
It is an opportunity where we can 
make a couple of hundred thousand. 

988
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:42,864
Each. 

989
01:30:45,091 --> 01:30:46,147
?Qu? I'm going to get? 

990
01:30:47,084 --> 01:30:49,898
She has a tendency 
forget what matters. 

991
01:30:50,172 --> 01:30:51,814
As I said, he has his own mind. 

992
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,424
I heard everything you said, 

993
01:30:57,404 --> 01:30:58,576
I have thought about that. 

994
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:03,382
Opportunities like this do not 
knock on your door every day. 

995
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:05,220
How right you have. 

996
01:31:10,652 --> 01:31:13,037
- You gotta say it was good. 
- S? was. 

997
01:31:15,106 --> 01:31:16,906
Then I, I thought it is? Well. 

998
01:31:17,453 --> 01:31:18,939
Okay, now we are talking about. 

999
01:31:19,136 --> 01:31:21,011
- Hey, it's a deal. 
- Agreed. 

1000
01:31:21,207 --> 01:31:22,343
- It's a deal. 
- Agreed. 

1001
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:33,185
Are not you gonna join? 

1002
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:36,861
He is a scammer. 

1003
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:39,986
I think he even 
is known that "in a scam. 

1004
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,115
So how can we do? 

1005
01:31:44,794 --> 01:31:46,046
Like everyone, baby? 

1006
01:31:50,617 --> 01:31:52,338
As to all. 

1007
01:32:01,905 --> 01:32:02,687
Are you ready to make you rich? 

1008
01:32:04,058 --> 01:32:05,072
Pens? Already was. 

1009
01:32:06,051 --> 01:32:10,154
Hell, this was not anything that I say 
after today you'll live much better. 

1010
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,185
We before 2 

1011
01:32:12,621 --> 01:32:15,395
climb the Empire building 
State, things will go up. 

1012
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:17,546
Wait until 
say so, as we do. 

1013
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:51,739
All? Go. 

1014
01:32:55,608 --> 01:32:56,428
Hey, come on. 

1015
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,164
Come on. 

1016
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:04,752
Hey, what? Wrong? Come on. 

1017
01:33:10,695 --> 01:33:11,476
S¨ªguete moving, come on. 

1018
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:18,471
I swear by God that he knew nothing of it. 

1019
01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:21,171
- I think it s? 
- Qu? 

1020
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:22,422
Shut up, Kate. 

1021
01:33:25,002 --> 01:33:25,980
Should be looking for. 

1022
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:30,870
I think that's it. 

1023
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:33,797
Oh, my God. 

1024
01:33:34,657 --> 01:33:35,752
Damn. 

1025
01:33:36,493 --> 01:33:37,080
Here. 

1026
01:33:37,472 --> 01:33:38,061
Take this. 

1027
01:33:40,757 --> 01:33:42,165
Stay with her now. 

1028
01:34:07,776 --> 01:34:09,809
- Are you going somewhere? 
- John, well, what is? William? 

1029
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:12,272
Poor. 

1030
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,360
- Get the car, asshole. 
- Qu? 

1031
01:34:16,028 --> 01:34:16,655
?Qu? Happens? 

1032
01:34:17,124 --> 01:34:17,792
I heard. 

1033
01:34:18,378 --> 01:34:19,277
Come on, asshole. 

1034
01:34:19,515 --> 01:34:21,780
- You are screwing. 
- No, I do not Move. 

1035
01:34:25,023 --> 01:34:26,275
It is time to implement the plan. 

1036
01:34:27,447 --> 01:34:27,993
You're not kidding. 

1037
01:34:29,598 --> 01:34:30,224
Wait a minute. 

1038
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:31,437
You can not do this. 

1039
01:34:31,906 --> 01:34:32,727
Oh, s? Who says? 

1040
01:34:33,353 --> 01:34:33,978
Is it the money? 

1041
01:34:34,643 --> 01:34:36,871
Listen to me, is why? 
Is that, right? Money. 

1042
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,725
because if the money is what you want, 
you can stay, take everything. 

1043
01:34:40,155 --> 01:34:41,133
Come on, Kate. 

1044
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,188
Kate. 

1045
01:34:42,619 --> 01:34:43,401
Come on. 

1046
01:34:43,753 --> 01:34:46,566
We do not have to do this, I 
can stay around, please do not shoot. 

1047
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,723
Come on. 

1048
01:34:52,426 --> 01:34:53,713
Told us we were. 

1049
01:35:15,322 --> 01:35:15,987
So what? Do? 

1050
01:35:16,885 --> 01:35:19,072
Come to the cemetery, 
I expect huh? 

1051
01:35:19,894 --> 01:35:21,420
- Qu? That was not the plan ... 
- It is now. 

1052
01:35:21,656 --> 01:35:24,083
- Look, wait a minute. 
- I told you, you have to rely on m? 

1053
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:25,334
S? that's good. 

1054
01:35:28,421 --> 01:35:32,524
Okay, you stay t? 
with the suitcase, qu? such that? 

1055
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:36,745
Agreed. 

1056
01:35:38,168 --> 01:35:38,988
Sounds good. 

1057
01:35:46,801 --> 01:35:48,209
Expected to return. 

1058
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:06,806
Where is? 

1059
01:36:06,964 --> 01:36:07,472
S not? 

1060
01:36:08,213 --> 01:36:08,841
He huy? 

1061
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,263
He dispar? And corrected? In the woods. 

1062
01:36:11,655 --> 01:36:12,711
That shit. 

1063
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:16,349
Where does it go? 

1064
01:36:16,948 --> 01:36:17,730
How do I know? 

1065
01:36:22,614 --> 01:36:23,357
The cemetery. 

1066
01:36:50,286 --> 01:36:51,496
That bitch. 

1067
01:36:52,123 --> 01:36:53,099
Stupid bitch. 

1068
01:36:58,257 --> 01:36:59,237
Damn. 

1069
01:37:05,726 --> 01:37:06,625
Hey. 

1070
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:07,803
Where is? Whore? 

1071
01:37:08,077 --> 01:37:08,624
Where is? 

1072
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,544
Just jodernos. 

1073
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,107
- Shit. 
- Where is? 

1074
01:37:12,303 --> 01:37:14,570
- Get in the car, t? Drive. 
- Agreed. 

1075
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:16,487
Come on. 

1076
01:37:39,331 --> 01:37:39,958
?Qu? You delay? Both? 

1077
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:42,106
?Qu? Kind of game are you playing? 

1078
01:37:45,507 --> 01:37:46,798
It's called the truth game. 

1079
01:37:51,056 --> 01:37:51,799
Agreed. 

1080
01:37:52,347 --> 01:37:54,614
You're the gun, you deserve to know. 

1081
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:58,402
- I cheated. 
- Did what? 

1082
01:37:58,601 --> 01:37:59,498
Oh, t? Shut. 

1083
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,263
Can you believe it, baby? 

1084
01:38:01,927 --> 01:38:04,975
It is not difficult and I'm not your baby? 

1085
01:38:05,204 --> 01:38:06,222
S? good, 

1086
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:11,061
I could not let go 
that, you know how it is, baby? 

1087
01:38:12,349 --> 01:38:13,371
I'm beginning to know. 

1088
01:38:13,996 --> 01:38:14,622
As? To me, 

1089
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:16,540
Am I? 

1090
01:38:17,049 --> 01:38:18,611
My daughter, no. 

1091
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:20,683
T?'re It. 

1092
01:38:21,464 --> 01:38:22,206
Who was she? 

1093
01:38:22,644 --> 01:38:24,911
Only the best operator I have ever known. 

1094
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:27,685
She came to m? A scam, right? 

1095
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:30,695
It was assumed that I believe 
she had a market 

1096
01:38:30,932 --> 01:38:32,925
and was supposed to work under it. 

1097
01:38:33,161 --> 01:38:34,647
But then she 
love? of a man. 

1098
01:38:35,155 --> 01:38:36,288
So what? I was supposed to do? 

1099
01:38:37,739 --> 01:38:39,381
As? That tom? What she loved most, 

1100
01:38:40,402 --> 01:38:41,770
to you, baby? 

1101
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:44,545
He was my father? 

1102
01:38:45,167 --> 01:38:46,144
S? I think so. 

1103
01:38:47,237 --> 01:38:51,146
?Why? Me that not only 
suitcase and you forget all this? 

1104
01:38:52,088 --> 01:38:53,340
As is? Simple, right? 

1105
01:38:53,968 --> 01:38:54,555
John. 

1106
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,561
?Why? Not told that 
body left, Johnny? 

1107
01:39:00,538 --> 01:39:01,984
- S? did you contact? 
- Shut up. 

1108
01:39:04,796 --> 01:39:07,220
Leave this shit and give me the money. 

1109
01:39:07,924 --> 01:39:10,151
- No. 
- You can say that. 

1110
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:20,908
Looking for this? 

1111
01:39:21,574 --> 01:39:23,566
- S? 
- Tried to leave me lying, right? 

1112
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:28,684
Oh, come on, Johnny, was the only 
shape. Look, we gotta go ... 

1113
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:30,913
No, now listen to me, bitch. 

1114
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:33,102
Because I have the cards. 

1115
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:35,447
For once, I do not need 
your opinion at all. 

1116
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:37,951
You know? 

1117
01:39:38,536 --> 01:39:39,355
You're right. 

1118
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,725
S what? 

1119
01:39:42,366 --> 01:39:43,890
You must be well-maintained. 

1120
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:45,179
You bet. 

1121
01:39:46,978 --> 01:39:48,073
Unless there is more. 

1122
01:39:48,736 --> 01:39:49,519
S? I am sure you know. 

1123
01:39:50,106 --> 01:39:51,511
There are 3 times more. 

1124
01:39:52,175 --> 01:39:54,793
I think they would be so 
fool to leave everything ah? Huh? 

1125
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,137
Were working 
with a real class Z. 

1126
01:39:57,692 --> 01:40:00,193
The real money is? 
in a credit account. 

1127
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:01,095
That s what? 

1128
01:40:03,676 --> 01:40:04,965
Why what? Should trust you? 

1129
01:40:06,451 --> 01:40:08,911
- T yourself? It. 
- No, wait, you said 3 times. 

1130
01:40:09,187 --> 01:40:11,062
I did it again 
and I think we go alone. 

1131
01:40:11,335 --> 01:40:12,157
Not only .. expected. 

1132
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:15,089
Where is? 

1133
01:40:16,145 --> 01:40:16,886
Tell me where it is? 

1134
01:40:21,614 --> 01:40:22,591
Est? In the glove compartment of the car. 

1135
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:24,270
Agreed. 

1136
01:40:25,249 --> 01:40:25,953
Come on. 

1137
01:41:27,262 --> 01:41:28,006
Beb? 

1138
01:41:31,912 --> 01:41:32,812
Beb? 

1139
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:50,448
Oh, baby? You know what happens 
when an animal is cornering? 

1140
01:41:51,348 --> 01:41:53,223
Fight to the death. 

1141
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,857
Oh, s? You're here? 

1142
01:42:45,114 --> 01:42:47,718
They found the body 
William the next day. 

1143
01:42:47,754 --> 01:42:50,321
Everyone in the 
surroundings were concerned. 

1144
01:42:50,828 --> 01:42:54,463
I recognize that the fire was dying 
a just end to a life so bad. 

1145
01:42:55,171 --> 01:42:57,008
He had no more than they deserved. 

1146
01:42:57,672 --> 01:43:00,798
John was accused of killing Buster. 

1147
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:04,745
And he said they would not 
again see the light of day. 

1148
01:43:18,905 --> 01:43:20,624
Aunt Grace pardon? Uncle Jack. 

1149
01:43:21,718 --> 01:43:24,219
They did not come to talk 
what happened? this summer. 

1150
01:43:25,162 --> 01:43:28,873
And not long after that, Aunt 
Grace was the baby? Had expected. 

1151
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:33,639
Mam? Said that child was not 
more than a miracle from heaven. 

1152
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:04,713
And as for Kate, no one knew 
with certainty that it was made, 

1153
01:44:05,808 --> 01:44:08,191
Most grateful 
had been ido. 

1154
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,256
Perhaps she was a bit like mam? 

1155
01:44:13,154 --> 01:44:15,229
Could never be really 
like the rest of us. 

1156
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:29,256
But I, 

1157
01:44:29,532 --> 01:44:31,056
I like to believe is 

1158
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:34,415
she was always 
she wanted to do. 

1159
01:44:35,432 --> 01:44:38,167
And maybe, well, just maybe ... 

1160
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:41,375
reflects that 
moon arrives broken. 

1161
01:44:42,118 --> 01:44:44,857
Maybe you do to smile. 

1162
01:44:45,873 --> 01:44:47,085
At the end.
