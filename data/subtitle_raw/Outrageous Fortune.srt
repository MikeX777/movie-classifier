1
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:30,275
I just met you

2
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,572
Yet I'm feeling

3
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,871
It seems that somehow
we met somewhere before

4
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:39,743
I think I loved you

5
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:44,294
In my dreams 100 times or maybe more

6
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,092
What a connection

7
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:52,336
I just can't conceal it

8
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,300
There's a kind of magic in the air

9
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,882
Ooh, I can feel it

10
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,053
Something special

11
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:04,095
Is gonna happen tonight

12
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,311
I want you to know that

13
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,645
Something special

14
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:13,783
Is gonna happen tonight

15
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:18,031
I promise I'll be good to you

16
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,207
What a connection

17
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,837
I just can't conceal it

18
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:33,761
There's a kind of magic in the air

19
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,218
Ooh, I can feel it

20
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:38,632
Something special

21
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:42,937
Is gonna happen tonight

22
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,976
I want you to know that

23
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,142
Something special

24
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:52,280
Is gonna happen tonight

25
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:55,449
I promise I'll be good to you

26
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,574
Something special

27
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,576
Is gonna happen tonight

28
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,446
Oh! All right. That's it.

29
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:44,238
- What's the matter, Marie? What happened?
- She tried to kill me.

30
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,085
- Well, isn't that the point?
- No, Lauren.

31
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,416
This is theatrical fencing.
This isn't an autopsy. All right?

32
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,418
All right.

33
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,427
Damn it! I don't even know
why we have to do this.

34
00:02:57,513 --> 00:03:00,549
If you want to do Shakespeare,
Shakespearean people have duels.

35
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:04,508
- Not the women.
- It's my ambition to play Hamlet.

36
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:07,308
Oh, that'll pack 'em in the aisles.

37
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,474
Yes.

38
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,603
Paulette.

39
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,315
Lan.

40
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,077
Good. Lauren.

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,996
Excellent.

42
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,124
Naomi.

43
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:38,628
Bitch.

44
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,300
- Lauren.
- Hi, George.

45
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,513
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- What?

46
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,554
- Say, "Yes."
- George.

47
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,066
- Say, "Yes."
- Why are you acting like this?

48
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,033
Because I wanna be with you.

49
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,192
Well, that's nice.

50
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:06,165
This is so funny, George.
I thought you were gay.

51
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:10,246
Oh, I am. It's just, I play
so many heterosexual roles...

52
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:14,203
I feel I really need to
do some serious research.

53
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:17,256
Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,419
And just when you think
there's no greater depth...

55
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:21,588
to which an actor could possibly sink.

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,595
- That's nothin'. Remember Fred?
- Fred.

57
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,010
I've got a 50 percent
hearing loss in this ear...

58
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:31,307
from him yelling "Stella" in bed.

59
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:34,269
I tell ya, I swore
off actors a year ago.

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,479
I said if that's the only
subspecies of men available...

61
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,813
I'd rather not date at all.

62
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,398
And I haven't. But
there are other things.

63
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:46,621
My work, I perfect my craft.
L... Kor... Korzenowski!

64
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:49,955
- Yeah.
- He's taking students.

65
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:53,577
- Hey, but where you gonna get that kind of money?
- L...

66
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:57,205
I gotta use that phone.
Come on. You're up.

67
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,465
Who is it?

68
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:08,677
It's your sister-in-law. Hurry
up. My feet are falling off.

69
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,687
Well, hi, Shirley.
I'm glad you finally...

70
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:13,848
Wait a minute.

71
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,061
Get in front of the camera.

72
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:25,320
- I knew it.
- Come on, Mom. Let me in.

73
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,412
No, we can't afford it.

74
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,573
Mom, please.

75
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,742
- Is that my baby?
- Daddy!

76
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:35,955
Yes, but she can't come
in. She wants a loan.

77
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,122
Daddy, can I come in, please?

78
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:40,920
Please, please, please,
please, please, Daddy? Daddy?

79
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,086
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Oh, yes.

80
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,096
- You don't know she wants money.
- Of course she does.

81
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:49,515
- You don't know that.
- That's right, Mom.

82
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:53,516
Can't I just drop in to see my parents?

83
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,772
Okay, I need $5,000.

84
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,778
- But it's to study with Korzenowski. -
$5,000. - She might have a good reason.

85
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:05,612
- Daddy! Stanislav Korzenowski.
- $5,000, Daniel.

86
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,192
- I'll pay you back.
- What did you say?

87
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:10,363
W
- What was that?

88
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:16,993
- I know I owe you some money.
- You owe us $3 2,000.

89
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,923
But it's the Korzenowski.

90
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,384
Lauren, we sent you to Yale
and London and the institute.

91
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,337
You have been at this acting thing for
years, and you haven't earned a dime.

92
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,508
You are still working as a salesgirl!

93
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:33,602
- Honey, face it. Maybe it's time for you to give it up.
- Daddy.

94
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:36,178
- Daniel. Hey, what did you
do? - Oh. Oh, Daddy. - Nothing.

95
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:38,764
- You gave her that money? - Oh, Daddy.
- I cannot believe that you did that.

96
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:42,311
- She is our only child. - Oh. Oh, Daddy!
- I can't believe it. She is sucking us dry.

97
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:45,524
- $5,000. Thank you, Daddy!
- She isn't. Well, I just got another bill from Bloomingdale's.

98
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,692
- Oh, thank you.
- Drop that now. Don't you dare start talking about that.

99
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:54,453
Give me back my fuckin' quarter! Damn!

100
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,827
Well, good luck.

101
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,798
I'm Lauren Ames.

102
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,179
There's my application,
your board, your pen.

103
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:15,269
- Thank you.
- And my down payment.

104
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:18,438
Keep that for now. You
still have to audition.

105
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:21,015
- Right.
- Sit down. Mr Korzenowski will call you.

106
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,186
Thank you.

107
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,241
You nervous? Sorry. I'm sorry.

108
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:36,078
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay. No, I'm... I'm not... It's fine.

109
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,539
I guess we're all a little bit, uh...

110
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,834
Don't talk. Right.

111
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,412
Oh, boy. I don't blame you.

112
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:47,505
This is so intense. Shut up, Weldon.

113
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,465
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Holy Mary!

114
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,889
Isn't there one fucking phone
in this whole town that works?

115
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,387
You got a phone I can use?

116
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,947
Yeah, hi. This is Sandy
Brozinsky. Who's this?

117
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:14,281
Howie. Okay, Howie. I'm holding
in my hand this thingee...

118
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,862
says you're gonna turn
off my phone at noon.

119
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,997
Oh, yeah? Well, I wanna
tell you somethin'.

120
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,958
I just got out of the hospital.

121
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:23,121
I get home after two
months of intensive care...

122
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:26,547
they wheel me into my
building, I open my mailbox...

123
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:31,212
I find your thingee screaming at
me I have till 12 noon today...

124
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,713
Hey, no, you listen. You listen!

125
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,927
I just opened the damn thing. I just
now laid eyes on it for the first time.

126
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,431
What was I supposed to do?

127
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:43,856
Have 'em unhook the life-support
machine so I could pay my bills?

128
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:49,691
Oh, really? Yeah, so now I have
three... No, make that two minutes...

129
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:52,487
to write a check and wheel
myself down to your office?

130
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:54,652
Howie, is that the drill?

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,289
24 hours?

132
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,536
24 big ones?

133
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,121
All right, Howie. You're
a prince among men.

134
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,588
I mean it. I wanna have your child.

135
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,135
Yeah, bye.

136
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,305
No, stop!

137
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:23,558
Please, do not screech at anyone else.

138
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:28,225
I am trying to prepare
for an audition here.

139
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,396
Thank you.

140
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,731
Oh, yeah? What for?

141
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,742
A workshop with Stanislav Korzenowski.

142
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:38,283
Who's that?

143
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:41,373
Only one of the great
geniuses of the theatre.

144
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,617
Now if you don't mind.

145
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,914
Hey, maybe I should audition
for him too. I'm an actress.

146
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,884
Hey, no, I'm a pro. I bet
I'm more of a pro than you.

147
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,181
Uh-huh. Well, I just made
2,500 bucks doin' a movie, yeah.

148
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,887
That's where I've seen you.
It has been driving me crazy.

149
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:08,524
- You saw Ninja Vixens?
- I, uh, must have.

150
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,730
Huh. Well, this whole acting
thing's been goin' pretty good.

151
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,693
I mean, it's all just
bullshittin', right?

152
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,526
Actors are just
bullshitters who get paid.

153
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:20,697
Where do I sign up?

154
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,411
Just exactly what do you think
you're going to do in there?

155
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:28,420
I don't know. I'll make somethin' up.

156
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:32,455
You're going in to Stanislav
Korzenowski and wing it?

157
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,168
Jesus, you'd think I was
gonna go in and pee on him.

158
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:40,091
Listen to me.

159
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:44,134
You do not audition for a man
of Korzenowski's reputation...

160
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,306
without a prepared classical monologue.

161
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,605
That means Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare.

162
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:52,227
I'm doing Ophelia's mad scene. I'm
not waltzing in off the street...

163
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,856
saying, "Gee, I think
I wanna be an actress."

164
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:59,068
You know what I bet?

165
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:02,079
I bet you haven't been
laid in about a year.

166
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:09,710
- Ames, Lauren.
- Ah, ah.

167
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,917
Yes, I'm coming. I'm...
I'm... I will be co...

168
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,962
I'm... I'm... I'm ready. I'm... I'm...

169
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,971
- I'm ready.
- Quickly, Miss Ames.

170
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:21,547
I have a good mad scene.

171
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,806
It's really great. I just saw it.

172
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,971
Hmm.

173
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:58,381
I will not only wish you to
absorb everything that I say.

174
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:03,465
I will also wish you to keep
notes of everything that I say.

175
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,351
And I will wish to look at those notes.

176
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:12,816
Now if you say this
is like high school...

177
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:14,978
I do not apologize.

178
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,148
I am an old egotist...

179
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,693
and I want to know that
you record my ideas.

180
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:27,281
If you do not, you're
gone from the class.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,076
All right. We begin.

182
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:35,127
We begin with vowel groups.

183
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:37,707
Vowel groups.

184
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,837
Mr Weldon...

185
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,887
do you know the difference
between a Texas diphthong...

186
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,467
and a Georgia diphthong?

187
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,600
Sorry I'm late.

188
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,902
They made me fill out all these
dumb-ass financial aid forms.

189
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,112
You want 'em?

190
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:57,646
You want 'em?

191
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:00,858
I cannot believe... I absolutely
cannot believe he let her in!

192
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,026
And on scholarship!

193
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:06,036
I just bet I know what
she did as an audition.

194
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:10,082
The woman has no
training, no experience.

195
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,041
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.

196
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,416
I really thought if you
worked at your craft, maybe...

197
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,794
just possibly, you'd get to
work with one of the greats.

198
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:20,631
It's $2.95, not $295.

199
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,795
I knew that.

200
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:29,057
Something's seriously
wrong with my life.

201
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,470
Excuse me.

202
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,774
- Are you all right?
- Better.

203
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,070
L-I w... I was just, um...

204
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,233
- Who cares? May I help you?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:47,109
- Have you got something in a pumpkin?
- The shade pumpkin?

206
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:50,490
- No, a pumpkin costume.
- Oh.

207
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,659
God, I sound like an idiot.

208
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:54,827
The reason is that I
teach grammar school.

209
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,079
- You're a
schoolteacher? - Uh-huh.

210
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,960
- You're not an actor?
- Oh, God, no. I'd be awful.

211
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,924
Why do you ask?

212
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:05,462
Oh, well, there's just so many
actors who come in here. Please go on.

213
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:07,632
Well, we're putting
on a little pageant...

214
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,476
and there's a kid in my
class who's very insecure.

215
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,968
You know, the other kids pick on
him and his mother doesn't sew...

216
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,139
and I think it would
give him such a boost...

217
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,521
to have the best darn
costume in the place.

218
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,236
So I thought a professional costumers
would have an incredible pumpkin.

219
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:25,358
But I can't go more than $50...

220
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:27,739
because this is coming
out of my own pocket.

221
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:33,291
I'm really sorry. I don't
think we have a pumpkin.

222
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:37,415
What about a squash?

223
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:40,624
We don't have any vegetables as such.

224
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,257
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,835
Well, this is the
last place on the list.

226
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:50,679
But I'll just throw something
together myself, huh?

227
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:53,341
I really appreciate your time. Thanks.

228
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:57,304
Um, uh, listen. I don't know,
maybe, uh, maybe someone...

229
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,527
Maybe I could, uh... I've
made a lot of my own costumes.

230
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:05,859
I'm sure it wouldn't be that
difficult. If I could help out, I'd...

231
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,026
like to.

232
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,325
That would be fabulous.

233
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:23,628
- I hope you'll forgive me, Lauren.
- For what?

234
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:26,837
L... I don't usually
lunge at women like that.

235
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,764
- Oh.
- But you just, uh...

236
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,640
I just had to kiss you.

237
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:37,848
L-I really am sorry and I hope
that you'll want to see me again.

238
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,187
Oh, where in the world
did you come from?

239
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,812
- New Mexico, originally.
- No, no, I mean...

240
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:48,195
how can a man so delightful as you...

241
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:52,447
be just wandering the
streets of New York?

242
00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:55,658
Single, single, yeah.
I can't believe it.

243
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:58,916
Well, that's not by choice.
I'd like to be married.

244
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:03,331
- This isn't happening.
- Why not?

245
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:06,757
Well, there must be something wrong
with you. Don't you have any faults?

246
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:11,045
I smoke.

247
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:15,558
You smoke? That's it? Call the police!

248
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:19,179
No, no, no. It's an addiction.

249
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:23,223
Colton's tobacco. New Mexico's finest.

250
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,810
I hope you don't mind.

251
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:29,819
Well, I'll struggle through somehow.

252
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:33,617
Good. Very good.

253
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,824
Because, uh, I'd like
to see you again...

254
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,618
tomorrow night.

255
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,664
Well, yes.

256
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,346
Mmm, thank you.

257
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,437
What's this?

258
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:09,319
"Ooh, eee, ooh, ah, ooh, eee, ah, ooh."

259
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,360
- That's what you do in acting class?
- Those are vowel groups.

260
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:16,496
Mmm, sorry. "Wowel" groups.

261
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,537
- Ooh. -
Ooh. - Ooh.

262
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:21,791
- Ooh, I feel the same way.
- Ooh, ooh.

263
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,997
Will you please kiss
me hard on the lips?

264
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:29,665
That was tender, but tasty.

265
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,251
- Bite my face.
- Okay.

266
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:38,011
Bite my leg. Now bite my other leg.

267
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:44,605
- You get her two 1 X legs and...
- Going over the fence gymnastics?

268
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,980
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:51,688
Oh, my. That kind of evening, huh?

270
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:58,069
Not the kind you're used
to. No money changed hands.

271
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,379
No, no, no, no. Reveal, reveal.

272
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,802
You have killed your father.
You have married your mother.

273
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,380
Na, no words, remember.

274
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,307
Na, reveal.

275
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,939
Here we have a sick sea lion. Go.

276
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:38,318
- Miss Brozinsky.
- Okay.

277
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:42,362
You will now perform for
us, also without words...

278
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,031
Hamlet's soliloquy.

279
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,619
Who's that?

280
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,790
Hamlet.

281
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:54,419
Hamlet.

282
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:58,758
Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet.

283
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,343
Ah, well.

284
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:08,559
Uh, for her, we get the comic book, huh?

285
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,869
Taxi!

286
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:20,826
Hey!

287
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,090
Hey!

288
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:35,958
Oh. Ooh, that creep
Korzenowski is driving me nuts.

289
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,295
Ooh.

290
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:41,390
I know what I need.

291
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,983
Oh, God!

292
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:53,144
Oh, God!

293
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:56,154
Oh, God! Oh, God!

294
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,114
Oh, God!

295
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,743
Oh, God! Oh, God!

296
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,906
Ooh.

297
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,833
To die on the stage...

298
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,795
is perhaps the greatest
single challenge...

299
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:22,380
an actor can face.

300
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:29,855
The audience must know,
must absolutely believe...

301
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,645
that the breath, that the very life...

302
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,142
is going out of your body.

303
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,313
Now...

304
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:41,653
You! You will die now, please.

305
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:45,448
No, no, I don't believe you.

306
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,081
Maintain your focus.
Na, I don't believe you.

307
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,796
- Maintain your focus and lean forward.
- Stop, stop, stop. Stop it. Stop it.

308
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:02,388
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

309
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:11,057
Perhaps you would like to
die for us now, Miss Ames.

310
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:16,152
You, I think, I will shoot.

311
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:21,023
You will feel the
bullet enter your body.

312
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:24,450
You will lose all muscle control.

313
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:28,202
You will fall down dead.

314
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,534
Bang.

315
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,682
This can only be the achievement...

316
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,260
of years of training.

317
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:59,731
No other way would we ever
see so false a performance.

318
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:03,155
So mechanical, so thought-out.

319
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:07,785
Never for one moment truly felt.

320
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:13,079
Here, you must reach
deep inside yourself.

321
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,668
You must go beyond the
safety of what you know.

322
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:19,246
We know you can act, Camille...

323
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:23,802
but can you be a person
of flesh and blood?

324
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:26,260
Ah, time.

325
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,049
We die again tomorrow.

326
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,061
And, uh, please, give me your notebooks.

327
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:35,223
I wish to see them.

328
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:41,310
You can't walk there!

329
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:44,739
Hey, Ed, you want the delivery or not?

330
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:47,114
The man is a Nazi.

331
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:53,120
I have never been the
dumbest in any class before.

332
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,165
I haven't seen you for nine hours.

333
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:03,130
Taxi!

334
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:06,843
Taxi!

335
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:08,674
Mmm.

336
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,304
- You know what today is?
- No.

337
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:14,181
It's our third-week anniversary.

338
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:16,893
- Stop on the next corner.
- You got it.

339
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:21,276
- I think you need some roses.
- Oh, no, no, you can't afford any more flowers.

340
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:23,438
- Right here.
- No, don't stop.

341
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,022
- Half... Half a dozen.
- No, don't stop. I know what teachers make.

342
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:28,192
Don't stop.

343
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:44,751
Michael!

344
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,798
A crowd is gathered here. Traffic
is backed up for two blocks.

345
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,935
Killed in the explosion are Lee
Veran, the owner of the flower shop...

346
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:58,397
and Michael Santers, a teacher
at Holmes Elementary School.

347
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,898
Two terrorist groups have claimed
responsibility for the blast.

348
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,860
It's all right, Miss Ames. We've
got a positive ID from his wallet.

349
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,192
You don't have to see him.

350
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:12,990
I want to see him.

351
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:24,045
I warn you, there's
very little left to see.

352
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:28,296
Particularly in the,
uh, upper body region.

353
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,012
I wanna see him.

354
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:36,678
I'm very sorry you
feel a need to do this.

355
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,475
Just leave me alone with him, please.

356
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,496
What are you doing here?

357
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:03,168
- Me? What the fuck are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.

358
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:05,544
- I am in mourning.
- Well, so am I!

359
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:09,167
- For my lover.
- Well, so am I!

360
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:15,384
- Who?
- Michael Santers.

361
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:19,639
- No, no, you little witch! No!
- You bitch, you didn't know him!

362
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,102
- Oh, he loved me.
- How could you lie, little bitch?

363
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:26,058
- Oh, get away from me! Oh!
- Get out of here right now!

364
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:30,945
- I'm gonna bitch-slap you! I'm gonna break
every bone in your body! - Oh, you are?

365
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:33,738
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am!

366
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,487
How dare you! How dare you!

367
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,118
- Oh. Ooh.
- He loved me.

368
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:44,453
He loved me!

369
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,788
Loved you? Loved you?

370
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:49,552
- Damn right he did!
- Ha, that's obscene.

371
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:53,467
No, that's reality, baby, 'cause no
way did that guy give a shit about you!

372
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:59,387
I refuse to believe for one
second that he would lower himself.

373
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:03,227
Oh, he lowered himself, all right.

374
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:07,942
This is all a lie. You are
psychotic. Yes, that's right.

375
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,148
I've known from the first time I
saw you sleaze into that office.

376
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,482
You lied to that phone man...

377
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:16,197
you lied your way into the
class and you're lying now.

378
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,778
- I'm gonna get you for this!
- Whoa!

379
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,865
Whoa, my... Oh!

380
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,642
Well, what the hell?

381
00:26:47,735 --> 00:26:50,440
- Well, that's not his...
- No way. Look at that.

382
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:54,278
- It's too small.
- It's a fuckin' pencil.

383
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:58,115
- Where's the appendix scar?
- And that little mole?

384
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:01,654
It's somebody else! He's alive!

385
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,825
He's alive! He's a...

386
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:09,290
Well, thank you. Wait a minute,
wait a minute. This was my idea.

387
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:11,457
I don't care, I'm gonna handle this.

388
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,709
You don't have the dimmest,
dullest notion how to handle this.

389
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:16,340
You can't just walk in and bluntly
announce this kind of thing.

390
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,506
Thing, thing. What kind of
thing are you talking about?

391
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,516
You can't even say it. You
sure as hell can't tell 'em.

392
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:24,852
And just what do you think the
response is going to be when you do?

393
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:30,018
You suggest...

394
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,984
You suggest...

395
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:41,445
You suggest that on the basis of
this little nugget of testimony...

396
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,702
we spend tax dollars
on an investigation?

397
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,870
Have you been listening to us?

398
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:53,091
The man in the morgue could
not possibly be Michael Santers.

399
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:56,295
All you have to do is look at his...

400
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:58,593
If you were to look...

401
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,053
in the region...

402
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,140
If you were to look down.

403
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:11,683
Michael was not a guy other guys would
have made fun of in a locker room, okay?

404
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:17,068
- I think he's got the big picture now.
- Well, I don't think he does.

405
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:20,075
This guy in the morgue, whoever he is...

406
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,616
he's got, uh...

407
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:26,449
Does the phrase "needle dick..."

408
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:29,543
"the bug fucker," mean anything to you?

409
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,962
- I beg your pardon!
- You big lunkhead!

410
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:35,622
Now get outta here and don't come back.

411
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,551
The model of tact and decorum.

412
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:40,713
Oh, who gives a shit?
He wasn't gonna help us.

413
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,842
Well, of course not! You sounded insane.

414
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:46,852
Oh, it is insane.

415
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,013
If he's alive, where is he?

416
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:52,855
He's probably back at my house,
wonderin' where the hell I am.

417
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:55,019
- Taxi! - Your
house? - Taxi!

418
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,188
- Oh. - Taxi!
- Wait a minute.

419
00:28:57,281 --> 00:29:01,195
- W-W-Wait just a minute
here. - Come here! Taxi!

420
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,776
I don't believe for one minute
that he's at your apartment.

421
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,947
Oh, boy, are you gonna shit cement!

422
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,957
Taxi! Taxi!

423
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:12,993
If Michael is anywhere, I
assure you he is at my place.

424
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,374
- Taxi, taxi!
- Oh, you believe that?

425
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:20,167
I believe that he loved
me, that he barely knew you.

426
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:23,927
And you're... you're fantasizing
a relationship that is probably...

427
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:27,432
- an isolated, drunken encounter.
- Isolated? Isolated?

428
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,271
Hey, this girl does not
have one-night stands.

429
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:32,395
Every guy I have ever slept with...

430
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:35,567
and we are way into double digits
here, has come back for more.

431
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:38,144
Every single one!

432
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,812
- You wanna hit me, right? - Oh, wouldn't
I just love it. - Okay, give it a try.

433
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:43,743
Give it a try. Let's go, let's go.

434
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:45,904
Bob and weave, honey. Bob and weave.

435
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,570
- Who dresses you anyway?
- Okay, okay. Try it. Okay.

436
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:56,588
Stand still, you little bitch. I'm
gonna bash your little WASP brains out.

437
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:59,081
I'm gonna hit you. I'm gonna murder you.

438
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:02,094
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Talk about dingbats.

439
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,884
They'll lead us right to him.

440
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:10,558
- Nine... Nine years of ballet!
- You're too weird to hit.

441
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:13,018
- Taxi! - Oh, taxi!
- Taxi! - Taxi!

442
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:16,108
Taxi! Well, now wait just
a minute. Wait just a...

443
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:20,405
All right, all right. Okay, okay. You
insist Michael is at your apartment.

444
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:22,778
I think he's at mine.
So we'll go to both.

445
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,942
If he's at your place, which I doubt...

446
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,111
then I will tell him
goodbye and good riddance.

447
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:29,280
If on the other hand he's at mine...

448
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:32,493
you will find yourself a nice
biker and compare tattoos.

449
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:44,210
Oh!

450
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:46,974
You see, he's here.
Now don't make a scene.

451
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:49,762
Try to be adult about this.

452
00:30:56,734 --> 00:31:00,482
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, it's just thieves.

453
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:04,407
Russian thieves?

454
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,739
He was here.

455
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,951
- Colton's?
- They're looking for Michael.

456
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,662
Let me see.

457
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:29,179
Hi, Mrs Hardy.

458
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,722
- Who are these morons?
- I don't know.

459
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,179
Stop! Come back!

460
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:38,059
Oh, oh. Oh, God.

461
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,641
- Oh, my God.
- Help me.

462
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:42,812
Come on!

463
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,197
Pretty baby.

464
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:16,350
- Oh!
- Put it down. This isn't supposed to be up.

465
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:19,807
Oh, damn! You messed up the thingee!

466
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:26,481
You crazy bastards.

467
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:56,889
Mr Atkins, these girls are
bimbos. They know nothing.

468
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:59,055
- What do we want 'em for?
- They know he survived.

469
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:01,437
They may know where he is. We
gotta get back on the trail.

470
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:04,230
So we're gonna cover every
airport, every bus depot...

471
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,775
every train station, every
car rental out of this city.

472
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:17,288
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

473
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,255
Well, so much for your
apartment. You wanna try mine?

474
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,556
They've been here. Oh, my God.

475
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:40,978
Wait a minute. Nobody's
been here. This is normal.

476
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:45,109
- Come on. Geez!
- Oh, no.

477
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:48,314
Michael? Michael?

478
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:52,652
Michael? Michael? Mi...

479
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,776
- He's not here.
- I'm going to find him.

480
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:59,121
- Oh yeah? -
Yeah. - Where?

481
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,580
Well, he... he could be hiding,
he could be hurt. I don't know.

482
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,753
But I know that he needs
me. Now if you'll excuse me.

483
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:07,674
Where you gonna look? His apartment?

484
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,878
You think he's gonna be hangin' out at
his apartment, someone wants to kill him?

485
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,840
Oh, well, I'm not
going to his apartment.

486
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:19,220
- Then where are you going?
- Isn't that my business?

487
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,600
Okay, look. Hold it, okay?

488
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:24,524
All right, if you have an
idea, you might as well tell me.

489
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:28,522
And we'll both go. We'll go find
him and we'll help him out of this.

490
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:30,901
And then we'll make him choose.

491
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,899
- Choose?
- Yeah.

492
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:34,984
- Between us?
- Yeah.

493
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,954
- I doubt that he'll know your name.
- Then we're on.

494
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,623
I mean, you're so goddam sure it's
gonna be you, what do you care?

495
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,243
I'm confident, yes.

496
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:50,256
Well, so am I. So let's go.

497
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:53,877
- Good.
- Oh, wait. I gotta fluff.

498
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:00,475
Could you fluff a little faster?

499
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:04,012
- What is that?
- I got it off a Christmas tree at Saks.

500
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:08,056
- You defiled a Christmas tree?
- No one saw.

501
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:10,773
What, nothing for the nose?

502
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,948
Oh, Lady Di, explain this to me.

503
00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:19,368
The man's afraid for his life.
He's not gonna stop and buy tobacco.

504
00:35:19,455 --> 00:35:23,618
Oh, you obviously didn't spend the
kind of time with Michael that I did.

505
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:27,754
- He... He couldn't last a day without his Colton's.
- I knew that.

506
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,543
Uh-huh. Did you also know this is the
only place in town that carries it?

507
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,958
- I didn't know that.
- No, no, you didn't.

508
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:37,263
Now, listen. This time,
let me handle this.

509
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:39,839
Your simplest exchanges with
people become pornographic.

510
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:43,184
- That is a fucking lie.
- Need I say more.

511
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,346
Excuse me, sir.

512
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,977
Yeah, I know the guy.

513
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:50,902
Have you seen him? Was he here today?

514
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,145
Yeah, maybe.

515
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,777
Maybe not.

516
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:00,070
When do you think you
might arrive at a decision?

517
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:03,614
Uh, over a drink?

518
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:07,871
Mm-hmm. Wouldn't you feel
better, as a person...

519
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:12,588
just unselfishly helping somebody find
out something she really needs to know?

520
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:16,091
No. How 'bout dinner?

521
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:20,596
- How 'bout a blow job?
- How 'bout a...

522
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:25,391
- What did you say?
- Right here. Right now. Both of us.

523
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:29,892
Kind of, uh, taking turns.

524
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:34,769
- He was in here this afternoon.
- This afternoon?

525
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,152
- You sure it was this afternoon?
- Yeah, right at my lunch break.

526
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:39,530
1:00. He bought 10 pouches of Colton's.

527
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:42,109
- What else?
- Nothing. He was kinda in a hurry.

528
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,280
He used the phone and then
he ran right out of here.

529
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,745
He used the phone at 1:00? Is that it?

530
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:49,954
That's all she wrote, baby.

531
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:54,627
Here or in the back?

532
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:57,920
I think I can take care of it from here.

533
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:01,129
Couple of floozies!

534
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:03,512
Oh, my God.

535
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,135
- That is the most disgusting, unscrup...
- What is your problem now?

536
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:11,606
Promising sexual favours? That
sends us back to the Dark Ages.

537
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:13,768
It's something you simply do not do!

538
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:17,194
You do if you're lying.
Besides, it worked.

539
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,444
Excuse me, but I must
have missed something.

540
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:26,242
How exactly did it work?
We're at a dead end.

541
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,822
- You'll see. - I'll see?
- Howie Rinker, please.

542
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:32,867
- Oh, Howie.
- How! San!

543
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:35,252
- Great, how 'bout you?
- Hey, Frankie, wanna paper?

544
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,128
Yeah? How's your fish?

545
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,507
Uh-huh. What'd the vet say?

546
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:43,301
- What does a diseased fish have to...
- Stop it. It's in the bag.

547
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,348
Listen, cutey.

548
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,723
Seeing as how you're my main
man over at the phone company...

549
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:50,848
I wanna ask you just a
teensy favour, all right?

550
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,934
Can you tell me what number was called
out of Wally Frank Tobacconist at 1:00?

551
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:59,978
- This afternoon. Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.
- This is good.

552
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:03,822
It's probably one of those guys
with polyester pants and hips.

553
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,987
- Yeah, I'm
here. - Uh-huh.

554
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,115
- Good boy.
- All right.

555
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:13,075
That's a cab company, right?

556
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,246
Got it. Oh, you're a catch, How.

557
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,711
Our kids are gonna be
gorgeous, you know that?

558
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,635
- See you.
- Okay, don't gloat.

559
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,379
Taxi!

560
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,142
Is that all the money
you walk around with?

561
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:40,612
Well, where's yours? I thought you
were the working pornographic actress.

562
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:42,904
I went to the Bahamas.

563
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:49,706
Hi. Can you help me? I,
uh... I'm such a ditz.

564
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,993
L-I left my, uh, tennis racket
in one of your cabs today.

565
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:56,786
Uh, I was picked up around,
uh, uh, 77th a-a-and Broadway...

566
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,957
at 1:00.

567
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:02,715
- Is there a
reward? - Yes. - No.

568
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:05,092
Ooh! Ah!

569
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,680
What the hell is goin' on? What
the hell you gonna do to me, huh?

570
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,258
- What's wrong with you?
- Yo!

571
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:13,844
Dipstick! There's your man.

572
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:16,015
What?

573
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,857
- Your turn.
- Come on, Rico. Back to work.

574
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:22,863
- I don't wanna go back to work.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

575
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:26,198
No, I can't talk to him.
I went to a private school.

576
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:29,451
Hey, he looks like a
prince. He's gonna love you.

577
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:38,375
Hi.

578
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:41,963
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about a fare...

579
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:44,755
you might've had earlier in the day.

580
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:47,799
A very attractive Cauca-ca...

581
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:53,802
Just "person" will do nicely,
won't it? Why differentiate?

582
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:58,641
You would have picked him up, uh,
right outside a little smoke shop.

583
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:03,064
Does that ring any bells of any kind?

584
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:06,939
Whatsoever? Hello?

585
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:10,365
- Tall dude? -
Yes. - Tweed coat?

586
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,992
Yes, yes. A tweed coat, right.

587
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,117
I don't remember a thing.

588
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,709
- No, no, you just said a tall dude...
- I didn't say nothin'.

589
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:23,332
Oh, come on now. Don't give
me a big song and dance.

590
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:25,632
Oh, no.

591
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,096
Yeah. Oh, my God.

592
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:35,759
- He's going to hurt us.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

593
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:39,223
Why should he help us
with nothin' in it for him?

594
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:42,353
All right, you tell
me. What should I do?

595
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:46,276
You're an actress. Bullshit him.

596
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:50,659
I don't use my training
to tell lies to people.

597
00:40:50,744 --> 00:40:55,537
Well, what do you use it
for? Geez, it's so simple.

598
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,702
Hey, how'd you like to
make a quick 200 bucks?

599
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:03,714
- Say what?
- 200 bucks, cash...

600
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:07,382
to take us to where
you, uh, took the guy.

601
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:16,100
Are you out of your
mind? We don't have $200.

602
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,938
Ah, chill out, would ya?

603
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:22,308
Where are we?

604
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:27,229
We've been going for miles, and I haven't
seen a single white person on the street.

605
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:30,905
There's one. Oops, they got him.

606
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:33,401
That's not funny.

607
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:47,217
- Oh, my God.
- You sure this is it?

608
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:53,593
Hey, keep your pants on. We're
coming right out, all right?

609
00:41:55,184 --> 00:42:00,640
Look, you know and I know I'm never gonna get
another cab to come out here to Vietnam, cue ball.

610
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,400
So get real, all right?

611
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,687
All right, I'll give you 300 bucks.

612
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:09,104
Three hundred bucks just to
sit here till we get back.

613
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,190
Three hundred?

614
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,442
You're a real pain in
the ass. You know that?

615
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:17,580
- Gonna break his neck. I'm gonna break his neck.
- Beyond belief.

616
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:20,286
- You're really determined to have us killed, aren't you?
- Hey, get over yourself.

617
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:22,250
- He's not gonna kill us.
- Oh? Why not?

618
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:26,084
- 'Cause we're gonna be raped and murdered in this building.
- Oh!

619
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,634
Oh! Ohh.

620
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,181
Oh, no. Oh. Is that urine on the floor?

621
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:39,718
- What's a little urine?
- Freeze!

622
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:44,141
- Oh, my God, he's just a child.
- Well, at least rape's out.

623
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:48,444
Let me do this. Do you really think you
should be playing with your daddy's...

624
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:51,648
Shut up! Where's your
money? Credit cards!

625
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,907
- Revoked. Where do you think?
- Your bags.

626
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:58,943
- Throw 'em over here.
- Oh, I love this bag.

627
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:05,201
Ohh! Oh! Oh.

628
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:12,011
I'm not hit. You little...

629
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:14,217
Give me that, you little thug.

630
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:17,590
- I'll be damned. -
What? - It's a fake. - Oh.

631
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:20,352
- Where'd you get this?
- Santa.

632
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:24,979
Oh, yeah? Well, if you want to see another
Christmas, you're gonna have to help us find someone.

633
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:34,230
Shh.

634
00:43:51,258 --> 00:43:54,627
- Come on, man, stop begging.
- This was a mistake.

635
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,425
Not any more.

636
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:59,922
Police! You're under arrest!

637
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:06,772
Don't even think about it. Don't even fuckin'
think about it, or I'll blow your fuckin' nuts off!

638
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:11,104
Do we understand each
other? Okay, turn around.

639
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:14,611
Face the wall. Do it.

640
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:17,616
Do it! Do it! Do it!

641
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:20,951
- Okay, frisk 'em.
- Frisk 'em?

642
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:28,077
Damn. Busted by two broads.

643
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,840
Nice buns, boys. You been working out?

644
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:41,760
Read 'em their rights.

645
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,176
You have...

646
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,970
the right to remain silent...

647
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:51,398
because anything you say can...

648
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,403
and will be used against you.

649
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:56,611
You, uh...

650
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:03,446
Attorney. You have, uh, you
have the right to an attorney.

651
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,952
- Shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it, I heard it.

652
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,878
Hey, look, look, what do you
want? You got it. Just talk to me.

653
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:13,288
You know, he's right. We could
make you a real sweet deal, baby.

654
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:16,003
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard it.

655
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,762
Wait a minute. Maybe they
can help us find Santers.

656
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:21,930
- They don't know Santers.
- Michael Santers?

657
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:25,716
The hell you say! He was just here.
He was just here a few hours ago.

658
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:28,598
- Rat fixed him up with a passport.
- Ah, fuck you, Gilroy.

659
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:33,849
- What the fuck you want me to say?
- Oh, we're in the phoney ID business as well. Ain't that nice?

660
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:37,444
- What name was the passport under?
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.

661
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,947
Oh, yeah? It's gonna be
kind of a short conversation.

662
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:43,526
They'll have to squeegee
your brains off the wall.

663
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,665
Yeah. You, uh, you
better tell her the name.

664
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,368
- She's kinda cranky.
- Yeah. I got my period.

665
00:45:52,755 --> 00:45:55,756
- John Strauss.
- John Strauss.

666
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:59,127
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, look, he's leaving town. That's all I know.

667
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,889
Hey, look, I'm bein'
real nice here, huh?

668
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:06,100
Why don't you be nice and,
uh, open that box on the table?

669
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:08,142
Go on.

670
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:16,729
- Now, look, why don't you just keep it?
- You givin' them the money?

671
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,572
- Forget that we ever met.
- Are you sick?

672
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:23,868
- Turn around!
- Yeah. Happy to.

673
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,202
Well, I hate to give it to
you, but that was pretty good.

674
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,580
Yeah, it was, it was.

675
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:37,545
Yeah, yeah.

676
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:41,216
Well, a deal's a deal.

677
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:44,886
And now, my man, we
wanna go to the airport.

678
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:50,678
The airport.

679
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:54,389
- Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- They don't give out passenger lists.

680
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:57,769
- You have to be police or FBI.
- You are such a dip.

681
00:46:57,862 --> 00:47:00,613
This is all the FBI we need.

682
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:03,271
His luggage was totally
over the weight limit.

683
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:07,531
Can you imagine the gall, trying
to bribe an airline official?

684
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:10,539
He offered me $ 100
to let it go through.

685
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:15,037
- Ah, what a world. I tell ya.
- This is the final boarding call for Eastern Airlines flight 501...

686
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:20,004
- Watch and learn.
- To Albuquerque, now boarding at gate 4 2.

687
00:47:20,092 --> 00:47:24,968
Excuse, please. I was
hoping you would to help me.

688
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:27,593
Uh...

689
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:29,889
how... how do I to say?

690
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,550
You say it quickly. I'm
off in three minutes.

691
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:39,021
My father, he's coming here. We...
No, I tell you from the beginning.

692
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:43,025
My name is Anna. This
is my sister Elona.

693
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:45,784
My half-sister. She
does not speak English.

694
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:50,446
My father, we have not seen him
since we was babies in Prague.

695
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:54,786
He send us here in suitcase on train.

696
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:57,913
We, uh, escape, you see?

697
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:03,379
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Now we get letter.

698
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:05,841
He escape.

699
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:08,052
He is here.

700
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,426
But we do not know where.
We do not know which plane.

701
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,682
Could be any plane. Please,
you tell us which plane. Please?

702
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:18,809
Absolutely not. I'm sorry.

703
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:43,289
That was the single biggest crock...

704
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:49,137
I've ever had the privilege to
hear in my 19 years at this airline.

705
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:54,561
I think that deserves something.

706
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:57,266
What was the name?

707
00:48:57,356 --> 00:49:01,899
- Strauss. John Strauss.
- John Strauss.

708
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:07,021
- Here we
go. - Uh-huh.

709
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:10,485
Flight 501 to Albuquerque.

710
00:49:10,577 --> 00:49:12,784
- Looks like you just missed him.
- Oh, no!

711
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:17,450
Wait a minute, wait a minute. He took another
line through St Louis, and it's delayed.

712
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:23,580
If I can put you on our flight
225 through Kansas City...

713
00:49:23,674 --> 00:49:25,168
- you can beat
him. - Yeah! - Aha!

714
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:28,094
- But it's leaving in one minute.
- You get the tickets, I'll hold the plane.

715
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:32,390
Oh, good, good. Two tickets
to Albuquerque, please.

716
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:36,306
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

717
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:39,349
- Oh, thank you.
- No parking.

718
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,312
The white zone is for the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only. No parking.

719
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:52,944
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

720
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:54,745
No parking.

721
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:02,538
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- Come on, over there, you jackass!

722
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:06,588
Officer, those men are bad!

723
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:09,083
Hold it right there!

724
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:14,381
Hold it! Come back here!

725
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:24,474
I swear to you, she'll be here any second.
Her ivy got caught in the luggage rack.

726
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,360
Sandy, where are you?

727
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:29,018
She's a sick woman. She's
gotta get on this plane.

728
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:31,949
There's a kidney in Kansas City
that's not gettin' any fresher.

729
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:36,945
Sandy! Excuse me. Look
out. Wait, Sandy. Sandy.

730
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,660
- Here you go.
- Hold up there!

731
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,704
- Anyone care for some money?
- Money! Money!

732
00:50:46,924 --> 00:50:50,209
What have you done? Oh, my God!

733
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,680
- That's all our money. What are you doing?
- Hey! Hey!

734
00:50:58,686 --> 00:51:01,223
Albuquerque, honey, Albuquerque. Thanks.

735
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:09,484
I gotta get on that plane!

736
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:51,321
I sell cars in Albuquerque.
Give us a call if you can.

737
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:54,856
- Wanna apprehend?
- No. We'll pick up surveillance.

738
00:51:56,827 --> 00:52:00,611
I had this old Cadillac, see? We couldn't
get rid of it. I said, what the hell...

739
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:03,031
Oh, my God, there they are.

740
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,292
- And I played it big. No use playing it little. I'm just sorry it was so...
- Look.

741
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:09,048
Fan out.

742
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:11,290
- Why don't you get your car the same colour as your...
- Come on.

743
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:15,381
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, where
you gals scootin' off to, huh?

744
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,851
- Panansky!
- Bobby, this way!

745
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:28,940
Ow!

746
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:52,499
Hey, buddy! Hey, where
do you think you're...

747
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,758
Throw something.

748
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,476
Go!

749
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:23,490
And I thought coach was bad.

750
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:34,248
Panansky! Panansky!

751
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:37,212
Excuse me. Sir.

752
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:41,252
- Has flight 501 arrived? - Yes,
ma'am. Right there. - Uh-huh. Yeah.

753
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:43,341
Panansky!

754
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,396
Where's he going?

755
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:55,521
No, no, ladies. You
know better than this.

756
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:59,480
- You're right. - That way. - You're
right, of course. Thanks for your help.

757
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:02,492
Panansky! Where the hell have you been?

758
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,416
- Michael! - Michael!
- There he goes!

759
00:54:10,502 --> 00:54:13,124
Wait! No, no, wait!

760
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:16,298
Oh, no, no!

761
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:18,921
Oh! Yes, okay.

762
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:31,637
- Hey! Stop!
- Go through that next light! Go through the yellow! Through it!

763
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:57,545
You can take the bike back.

764
00:54:57,633 --> 00:55:01,927
Michael and I will be spending
the night in that motel we passed.

765
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:05,796
Dream on. We'll be on a plane to Hawaii.

766
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:14,644
- I can't believe it.
- He's really in there.

767
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:17,059
Yeah.

768
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:19,394
What's the matter? You afraid?

769
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,896
Why should I be?

770
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,025
Then why don't you go rushing
into his... into his arms, huh?

771
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:30,157
Well, why don't you?

772
00:55:30,249 --> 00:55:33,285
It's a long way to come to get bad news.

773
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:35,369
Yeah.

774
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:37,870
Well...

775
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,127
- Oh, God!
- Oh, I know.

776
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:47,678
- Let me see.
- Oh, no! Oh!

777
00:55:47,766 --> 00:55:50,304
- Rat woman! Oh!
- Oh, it's not that bad.

778
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:52,351
- Oh, I'm...
- Oh, no!

779
00:55:52,438 --> 00:55:54,430
- Could we share the mirror?
- Oh, Christ!

780
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:57,809
- What is it?
- I would be getting a zit.

781
00:55:57,902 --> 00:56:00,393
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.

782
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,397
- No?
- No. You're worse than I am.

783
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:05,324
- At least you have eyelashes. Geez.
- Oh, what do you want? You're a natural blonde.

784
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:07,448
- And you tan. - I want
eyelashes. - You make me sick.

785
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:10,537
Oh, natural? You think this is natural?

786
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:12,781
"Oh, my dear, you too
can have this colour."

787
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:16,374
- No shit? It looks great.
- Oh, thanks. It's just a rinse and a cellophane toner.

788
00:56:16,462 --> 00:56:20,045
- Yeah? - You want a Tic
Tac? - Yeah. - Okay. L...

789
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:30,718
Well, I'd say good luck, but...

790
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:35,099
Yeah.

791
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:37,596
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

792
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:51,030
Hello.

793
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:54,288
Michael, no!

794
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:57,329
You.

795
00:57:07,847 --> 00:57:10,053
- Oh, Michael!
- Michael!

796
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:16,305
- He's all right.
- Oh! Let's get him out of here.

797
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:25,781
- Michael? Oh!
- Michael. Oh!

798
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:27,656
Oh!

799
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:30,576
You're okay. It's just a bump.

800
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:33,199
- Yeah.
- My God.

801
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:37,161
- Michael! - Michael! - I feel that
we are entitled to an explanation here.

802
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:39,409
- What is your relationship with this woman?
- Did you make it with her?

803
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:42,290
Do you even know this person?

804
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,836
- That's why you're
here? - Yeah! - Well...

805
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:47,463
I know you're in some sort of trouble,
but I'd like to discuss this first.

806
00:57:47,553 --> 00:57:49,711
- Please.
- Right now.

807
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:52,296
- W-Wait a minute. -
Please? - Oh, Michael. Here.

808
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:56,852
- Darling, let me help you up.
- Oh! Easy.

809
00:57:56,937 --> 00:57:59,606
- You mean you did this on
your own? - Yeah. - Yeah.

810
00:58:01,275 --> 00:58:03,563
- There's nobody with you?
- No.

811
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:06,226
- He changed the subject. Did you see how he did that?
- Yes, you did.

812
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:10,699
Now, look here, Michael, there's an issue at stake
and I'm sorry, you're just not going to get out of it.

813
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:15,826
- How did you follow me here? - L-l... Well,
we... we knew you weren't dead at the morgue.

814
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:18,240
- And you told them?
- Of course we told them. We...

815
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,706
- Shit.
- Bad idea, huh?

816
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:24,044
Wait a minute. You mean
you wanted to be dead?

817
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:27,215
It would have been useful.

818
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:34,421
Russell, abort the rendezvous. There's a
chopper out there, and this could be trouble.

819
00:58:34,516 --> 00:58:37,601
- Get out of here. I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
- Screw 'em. You got the stuff.

820
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:41,518
No, we don't have the advantage here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas. Acknowledge.

821
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:44,773
You're the boss. Over and out. Let's go.

822
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:52,947
You're not a schoolteacher,
are you, Michael?

823
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:56,202
Michael, what's going
on? What's in Tres Crucas?

824
00:58:57,498 --> 00:58:59,953
- I'm sorry you heard that.
- Who cares what I heard?

825
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,367
What was I to you?

826
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:04,999
- What was I?
- Convenient.

827
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:10,627
Moderately enjoyable...

828
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,878
largely forgettable...

829
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:15,723
and a lesson to me not
to leave loose ends.

830
00:59:38,914 --> 00:59:42,117
I can't go on. I don't wanna go on.

831
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:47,370
Oh, Mother told me about men like
this. I hate it when she's right.

832
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:50,252
Oh, loose ends!

833
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:53,379
That's all I was to him? A loose end?

834
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:57,800
What are you doing worrying about your
love life going to shit? We're gonna die!

835
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:00,217
That's comforting.

836
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:10,271
- Who the hell are they?
- Well, how am I supposed to know? He's after Michael.

837
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:14,648
They're the good guys!

838
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,030
- Help us! Take us!
- Down here! Here! Please! Help us!

839
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:21,529
Down here!

840
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:26,499
Get into the light! He won't
go for us if we're in the light!

841
01:00:26,587 --> 01:00:29,125
- But it won't hold still!
- It's moving too fast!

842
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:31,788
Sandy! Oh!

843
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:35,588
Come on, Sandy!

844
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:48,982
Hurry!

845
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:51,190
Oh, how do they ever catch criminals?

846
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:59,698
- He's going to cut us off!
- I'll get you. I'll get you!

847
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,970
Come on!

848
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:22,218
Looks like these ends are gonna stay loose
just a little longer, you big shithead!

849
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:28,261
Come on! Down here!

850
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:43,370
- Hello!
- Weldon?

851
01:01:43,455 --> 01:01:47,702
Hello! I guess you know Mr Atkins!

852
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:50,829
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's all right!

853
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:55,503
We're CIA!

854
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:57,715
CIA?

855
01:01:57,803 --> 01:02:00,555
Uh, can I offer you ladies
coffee, or, um, a Coke?

856
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,889
- Weldon!
- Weldon! What is going on?

857
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:08,896
I'm not authorized to debrief you at...

858
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:11,519
You're not authorized to debrief me?

859
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:15,274
After I saved you from
being throttled? Weldon!

860
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:21,655
Who is Michael Santers?

861
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:27,119
He was one of our best.

862
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:29,781
Very high clearance.
Access to everything.

863
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:32,498
And then...

864
01:02:32,588 --> 01:02:36,004
we began to suspect that he was a
double agent working for Korzenowski.

865
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:41,085
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Korzenowski, our teacher?

866
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,308
Our teacher and, I'm sorry to tell you,
a key undercover man for the Russians.

867
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:50,054
Oh, please! The man has a reputation.
He was the definitive Lear.

868
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:53,516
He is the definitive KGB.
That's why I was in that class.

869
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:57,986
I was supposed to keep an eye on him,
see if he and Santers were in contact.

870
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,527
- And they were?
- We still don't know how.

871
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:03,285
I never saw them come
within a mile of each other.

872
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:06,535
But somehow Korzenowski hired him.

873
01:03:06,622 --> 01:03:08,947
What did Michael do?

874
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:13,542
He stole the prototype
of an experimental virus.

875
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:19,169
It's called floratoxin. It's,
uh, an airborne defoliant.

876
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:25,049
A few drops destroys all vegetation for
hundreds and hundreds of square miles.

877
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,889
Like grass and trees a-and
the... and the whole shot?

878
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:31,515
- As in California.
- Oh, my God.

879
01:03:31,605 --> 01:03:35,899
- As in the entire wheat belt.
- He would do that?

880
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:40,646
All he has to do is spill a couple
of drops, and the wind'll do the rest.

881
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:45,734
Don't try to bargain with
me. I want $20 million cash.

882
01:03:45,828 --> 01:03:49,078
And please don't insult my
intelligence by trying to mark it.

883
01:03:49,164 --> 01:03:53,873
All right. Only it's going to take
a couple of hours. Where are you?

884
01:03:56,338 --> 01:03:58,960
Don't be ridiculous, Weldon.
They're his accomplices.

885
01:03:59,049 --> 01:04:01,338
- Oh, please! - They're
professionals. - Oh, no, sir!

886
01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:03,218
- I believe them.
- What?

887
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:05,380
- You believe that a couple of
two-bit actresses... - Oh, l...

888
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,430
- Where are they taking me? - Could
have tracked down Michael Santers? - Yes.

889
01:04:07,516 --> 01:04:10,268
It was a rendezvous. They helped him
to escape. I was there. You remember?

890
01:04:10,352 --> 01:04:13,638
Yeah, what did we know? He was just
some guy we happened to be boffing.

891
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:17,680
Damn it, I don't boff.
I have never boffed.

892
01:04:17,776 --> 01:04:21,856
Okay, had sex with. Is
that white enough for you?

893
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:24,984
- Move it.
- Sir, if you'll just go over their statements...

894
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:30,699
That's what I intend to do at Fort Morgan in a nice
underground cell until we get Santers' whereabouts.

895
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:35,535
You want to know his whereabouts? Fine. He
said he was going to Tres Crucas, New Mexico.

896
01:04:35,628 --> 01:04:38,881
That's a little bit too easy,
isn't it? Get in the van!

897
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:39,462
That's a little bit too easy,
isn't it? Get in the van!

898
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:44,044
Okay, okay, here's an idea. Why don't we all
go to Tres Crucas and see if Michael is there?

899
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:47,007
I'll prove it to you.

900
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:50,466
I kn... I know, I know. Your head hurts,
and it's our fault. I understand that.

901
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,468
- But if you'd only identified yourself...
- Oh, I see.

902
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:56,689
- You want me to walk up to enemy operatives and hand
over... - Oh, come on! - Ah, who's an enemy operative?

903
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:59,894
- Hey, Steve, why the hell are we slowing down?
- Wait just a...

904
01:05:03,531 --> 01:05:06,104
Who the hell are you?

905
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:12,286
Oh, my God!

906
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,791
Some of us who teach can also do.

907
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:29,756
What do you want?

908
01:05:29,848 --> 01:05:33,218
- Where is Michael Santers?
- Hey, you should know.

909
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,635
You're the ones he's working for.

910
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:50,484
This is last time I will ask you.

911
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,985
Where is Michael Santers?

912
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:11,887
Come on, come on, come on! Go. Go!

913
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:16,593
I think you'll stay.

914
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:55,262
I never died better, did I, teach?

915
01:06:55,351 --> 01:06:58,435
Okay, let's go up, real easy.

916
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,475
That a boy. That a boy.

917
01:07:01,565 --> 01:07:04,353
Yeah, you're a good
actor, but a lousy shot.

918
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:06,981
Please, look, we can make bargain.

919
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:11,483
- Uh, the KGB is very generous.
- Oh... Oh, stop with the KGB.

920
01:07:11,575 --> 01:07:14,113
How dare you defraud the entire
New York theatre community?

921
01:07:14,203 --> 01:07:15,662
- Lauren. - I've
never... Hi. - Lauren.

922
01:07:15,746 --> 01:07:17,904
- I've never heard such behaviour in my
life. - Lauren. - These people are artists.

923
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:21,332
- Lauren. - What is it? -
Th-That's not the hot issue here.

924
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:23,791
The... No. No.

925
01:07:23,879 --> 01:07:26,085
Okay. Okay, here it comes, Stan.

926
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:29,459
You're gonna tell us right now
what was going on in that class...

927
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:33,134
or Sandy's gonna shoot you.

928
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,048
I'll shoot it off, Stan.

929
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:41,142
We needed couriers.

930
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,100
- How? -
Yeah. - Uh...

931
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:46,267
your notebooks.

932
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,529
I left microdot for him in yours,
and he sent back reply in yours.

933
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:56,696
Well, if he stole the toxin
for you, why don't you have it?

934
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:04,375
He screwed you too.

935
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:06,620
He screwed me too.

936
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:14,219
Ladies, I admit I've made a big mistake,
but if you'd just put yourself in my hands...

937
01:08:14,305 --> 01:08:17,259
you can walk away from here right
now with full federal protection.

938
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:20,765
Complete clearance of
all conspiracy charges.

939
01:08:20,853 --> 01:08:25,811
I will give you free acting
lessons for the rest of your life.

940
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:29,269
- We'll pay all the expenses you've incurred.
- Oh, stop it.

941
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:32,860
The both of you, you're so
full of it. Come on, let's go.

942
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:35,356
It stinks around here.

943
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:37,858
Thanks for trying.

944
01:08:40,623 --> 01:08:44,288
- We'll find you.
- Not if the coyotes find you first!

945
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:55,337
- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
- Please!

946
01:08:55,429 --> 01:08:57,801
Please!

947
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:03,015
Blood is on your head, you putz.

948
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:06,354
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yeah.

949
01:09:08,108 --> 01:09:10,813
- We're a couple of chumps. You know that, don't you?
- Oh, we're worse than that.

950
01:09:10,903 --> 01:09:14,188
- Mmm, well, okay, yeah.
- I can't believe I didn't see it.

951
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:17,033
- I am so humiliated.
- I know.

952
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:19,655
He hit on us for those notebooks.

953
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:22,912
"Hit on"? He got me to pick him up.

954
01:09:22,998 --> 01:09:27,210
Tell me! I attacked
him in a Burger King.

955
01:09:29,254 --> 01:09:33,334
I worked all night on his
fucking pumpkin costume.

956
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:35,714
- For a mythical student, if you will.
- No!

957
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:37,760
- Yes!
- No.

958
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:41,097
Hey, I baked cookies
for his entire class.

959
01:09:41,183 --> 01:09:44,054
- Oh, no!
- Could you see me baking?

960
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:47,845
Icing... Icing these little
happy faces on every one of'em?

961
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,356
Well, I paid $5,000
to study with the KGB.

962
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:54,480
The KGB. Oh, my God!

963
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,979
Oh, he trashed me much
worse than he trashed you.

964
01:09:57,074 --> 01:10:00,739
- Oh!
- Really. Hamlet. How am I gonna know Hamlet?

965
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:07,413
You really should if you're
going to be an actress.

966
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:15,458
Oh, pardon me...

967
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:20,462
but, you know, we can't all of us study at the
London School of Shakespearean Weirdness, you know.

968
01:10:20,556 --> 01:10:23,592
Some of us had to schlepp
drinks for a living.

969
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,602
I'm sorry, Sandy.

970
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:34,350
Oh, God.

971
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,614
So, where you wanna go now?

972
01:10:41,327 --> 01:10:43,699
I don't know.

973
01:10:43,787 --> 01:10:46,907
They'll be after us.

974
01:10:46,999 --> 01:10:50,333
- I was thinking...
- Yeah. So was I.

975
01:10:50,419 --> 01:10:52,412
What?

976
01:10:52,504 --> 01:10:55,754
That we go find Michael
and rip his face off.

977
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:59,625
- That, and get the toxin back.
- Oh, the hell with the toxin.

978
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,923
- I just wanna rip his face off.
- No, we need the toxin.

979
01:11:03,015 --> 01:11:07,807
We don't want the CIA on
our backs all our lives.

980
01:11:07,895 --> 01:11:13,518
- Just so I get to rip his face off.
- I promise we'll rip his face off after we get the toxin.

981
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:17,108
Hey! Hello, honey! Hello!

982
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:19,604
No, no, you idiot!

983
01:11:21,534 --> 01:11:23,740
My shoes!

984
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:31,746
- Hey, Stan.
- What?

985
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:36,414
Looks like you're gonna
be facing KGB tribunals.

986
01:11:36,507 --> 01:11:40,587
Unless, of course, you'd
like to make an arrangement.

987
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:43,844
Would such an arrangement include, uh,

988
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:46,338
unlimited expense account?

989
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:50,342
Condo on the Potomac?

990
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:55,184
Redskins season tickets? Huh?

991
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:16,162
Aw, nuts!

992
01:12:16,255 --> 01:12:18,710
Thanks, Humphrey. It was sweet of you.

993
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:21,207
Oh, it was my pleasure, Lauren.

994
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:28,641
Well, what should we do first?
Get a little sushi? Take in a show?

995
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:43,489
Now, why do they do that?

996
01:12:43,574 --> 01:12:47,073
Has there ever been one woman in the
history of the world who actually said...

997
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:49,617
"Yes, fellas, please, take me now."

998
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:52,825
For a bed and a bath,
I'd... I'd consider it.

999
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:57,080
- Bite your tongue.
- Hey, turisto. Welcome.

1000
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:02,509
Hey, you're lookin' for a guide, right?

1001
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:08,049
Native Indian to show you the hidden
wonders of this great Chicatacawa nation?

1002
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,761
Well, ladies, you have found him.

1003
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:16,308
Special price, today only... $20.

1004
01:13:16,398 --> 01:13:20,645
I don't want to be the first to break
this to you... you are not an Indian.

1005
01:13:20,736 --> 01:13:22,693
That's a technicality.

1006
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:27,074
I've been a blood brother to
the Chicatacawa since 1968.

1007
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:30,943
I got a tan. What do you want for $20?

1008
01:13:32,498 --> 01:13:38,417
Honey, I'm an actress. I love to dress
up and pretend. And the hat is fabulous.

1009
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:42,039
But what we need right
now is to find a man.

1010
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:45,833
Well, okay, but it's
not gonna be that great.

1011
01:13:45,928 --> 01:13:48,383
- I'm a little bombed.
- What?

1012
01:13:48,472 --> 01:13:51,757
And it's still $20.

1013
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:54,341
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1014
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:58,055
- We're looking for a specific man...
- So we can kill him.

1015
01:13:58,148 --> 01:14:02,775
Oh, then you need a witness. Hey,
I'll stand up for you in court.

1016
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:06,776
I saw the whole thing. It was an
accident. The axe slipped out of your hand.

1017
01:14:06,866 --> 01:14:09,783
It's a wonderful scenario. When we
find the guy, we're gonna let you know.

1018
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:12,655
- Thanks.
- Find him?

1019
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:16,032
Find as in "locate"? "Track down"?

1020
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:20,123
Hey, now we are rollin'. We have
hit the nail right on the hammer.

1021
01:14:20,212 --> 01:14:23,961
I'm a tracker. That's
my vocation... a tracker.

1022
01:14:24,049 --> 01:14:28,378
A guy who tracks down other
guys. That's my main gig!

1023
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:31,922
Genuine Indian shit.

1024
01:14:32,015 --> 01:14:33,593
- What do you think?
- He's a bum.

1025
01:14:33,684 --> 01:14:36,519
But he might have good instincts.
Should we ask for references?

1026
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:39,521
Hey, you wanna find this guy or not?

1027
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:48,188
- Ah, ancient Indian techniques.
- Oh, those could be anybody's.

1028
01:14:48,282 --> 01:14:54,450
Yeah, they could...
anybody about 185 pounds...

1029
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:57,955
dragging his right leg a
little like it's injured.

1030
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,747
And...

1031
01:15:02,504 --> 01:15:05,458
smoking one hand-rolled Colton's...

1032
01:15:05,549 --> 01:15:08,087
every three minutes.

1033
01:15:09,303 --> 01:15:13,764
Admit it. The man is cool.

1034
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:16,387
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, baby.

1035
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:18,932
Yeah, why you do this to me, huh?

1036
01:15:25,736 --> 01:15:29,401
Oh, my God.

1037
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:33,784
Wow! That is some major
ill repute happening there.

1038
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:36,075
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, don't try it.

1039
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:40,375
You'll never get past
Gert. It's customers only.

1040
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:43,709
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on. Hey.

1041
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:47,924
- Let's go, will ya. Come on.
- Customers?

1042
01:15:48,008 --> 01:15:50,843
Customers! You get his
shirt, I'll get his pants.

1043
01:15:50,928 --> 01:15:55,471
What? Come on! You had your chance
at me, and you lost it. Come on, now!

1044
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:58,393
- Oh, I want the hat.
- Will you stop it!

1045
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:06,974
Who do you think you're kiddin', huh?

1046
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:14,487
How old are you boys?
Thirteen? Fourteen?

1047
01:16:14,577 --> 01:16:16,902
Hell, you're just babies.

1048
01:16:16,996 --> 01:16:20,364
Why, you can't even shave yet.

1049
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:24,834
- Your daddy know you're here?
- Hell, yes. He told us where to come.

1050
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,458
Come. Get it?

1051
01:16:27,548 --> 01:16:31,213
Oh. First time.

1052
01:16:31,302 --> 01:16:33,840
Oh, no way!

1053
01:16:33,929 --> 01:16:37,298
- It's his first time.
- What'd you tell her that fer?

1054
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:39,467
- You chickenshit, huh?
- I ain't! I done it plenty!

1055
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,098
- You chickenshit. You chickenshit.
- Oh, you always tell my secrets. I'm gonna get you.

1056
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:46,351
Chickenshit... Oh, lordy, don't do that.
That ain't no way to act in a whorehouse.

1057
01:16:46,442 --> 01:16:48,849
Be a man. Be a man!

1058
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:56,361
This is Tina and Maria. Have fun.

1059
01:17:00,414 --> 01:17:03,451
Yeah, now tell me how
we're gonna get it up.

1060
01:17:21,227 --> 01:17:24,062
Definitely not.

1061
01:17:25,397 --> 01:17:28,185
Oh, God.

1062
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:31,940
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1063
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:34,437
- He's there.
- "Oh, God, oh, God."

1064
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:37,568
- Won't be long now.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

1065
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:40,696
Oh, God. Oh, God!

1066
01:17:40,788 --> 01:17:44,322
Oh... Oh, God!

1067
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:47,038
- That was it.
- He'll be asleep in three seconds.

1068
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:50,579
Did you ever think you'd be
glad men roll over and pass out?

1069
01:18:06,355 --> 01:18:08,762
- Okay?
- You've gotta be...

1070
01:18:11,986 --> 01:18:14,393
Have a nice day.

1071
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:18,522
- I've come to a definite conclusion.
- What's that?

1072
01:18:18,617 --> 01:18:21,025
You can have him.

1073
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,323
Oh, God.

1074
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,487
Was it good for you too?

1075
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,567
H-H-Hurry!

1076
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:10,078
Hey, baby!

1077
01:19:30,355 --> 01:19:32,811
Help me up!

1078
01:19:37,029 --> 01:19:41,774
You guys are the sweetest,
most gorgeous creatures.

1079
01:19:41,867 --> 01:19:43,907
You're sweet.

1080
01:19:43,994 --> 01:19:46,402
Yikes!

1081
01:20:14,316 --> 01:20:17,566
- Hey, wait a minute. Guys!
- Wait a minute. We're not supposed to stop.

1082
01:20:17,653 --> 01:20:20,274
Why... Why are we
stopping? Why did we stop?

1083
01:20:20,364 --> 01:20:22,190
- Oh. Sorry. - Uh, w-we
have to get to a phone.

1084
01:20:22,283 --> 01:20:25,118
- Yeah, uh, uh, phone. - We have to...
Oh, God. - Phone. Phone. - Oh, my God.

1085
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:28,653
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get back to the reservation...

1086
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:32,163
before one of these guys hits
on me for my phone number.

1087
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:37,328
- Oh, come on, you don't look so bad.
- Except for prints don't work for him. He should stick with solids.

1088
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:41,290
- Wait a minute. Did he say phone?
- Phone!

1089
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:44,718
- Frank! - Leave me alone!
- Frank, you have to listen!

1090
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:47,047
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!

1091
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:50,640
- Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

1092
01:20:50,728 --> 01:20:54,144
- I'm sorry, Frank, but this is really important.
- Oh, leave me alone.

1093
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:57,019
- Just leave me alone!
- Look, we gotta use your phone.

1094
01:20:57,109 --> 01:20:59,944
Forget it! You stiffed me for $20.

1095
01:21:00,028 --> 01:21:04,490
You leave me in drag. You got some
maniac with a knife chasing you.

1096
01:21:04,575 --> 01:21:08,620
These things do not tempt me
to wanna team up with you guys.

1097
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:12,992
- Ah, what's wrong with my head?
- Are you okay?

1098
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:16,203
No! I think I'm gettin' sober!

1099
01:21:16,295 --> 01:21:20,162
Look, listen, Frank, we're
not just jerking you around.

1100
01:21:20,257 --> 01:21:22,463
Some guys are chasing us 'cause
one of them stole a virus...

1101
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:26,845
that's gonna kill and destroy all the plants and all
the trees for thousands of miles all the way around.

1102
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:30,097
We stole it back, so now they're
trying to kill us. You get it?

1103
01:21:30,184 --> 01:21:33,884
Jesus, the '60s were
good to you, weren't they?

1104
01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:37,099
Frank, that's right.
Think back to the '60s.

1105
01:21:37,191 --> 01:21:40,809
- People did things for each other.
- They were wasted.

1106
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:44,022
Listen, Frankie, get us
to a telephone, all right?

1107
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:47,483
I swear to you, you're
gonna be showered with money.

1108
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:49,901
Showered with money.

1109
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,994
Okay, ladies, this is it.

1110
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:01,546
This is it, Frank? It's not exactly
the hub of the reservation, is it?

1111
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:05,001
- Hey, it's off season. What do you want?
- We wanna use the phone, Frank.

1112
01:22:05,093 --> 01:22:07,798
Hey, five minutes. That's it.

1113
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:11,802
If you guys stay more than five minutes,
you'll bring down a goddam tornado.

1114
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:14,134
We have no intention of hanging around.

1115
01:22:14,228 --> 01:22:16,850
- Fine.
- I just wanna make this call... I must have that blouse!

1116
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:21,767
- That shirt has my name on it.
- Oh! Oh, I love this.

1117
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,696
- I wore one of these when I did Oklahoma.
- Oh, that'll be cute on you.

1118
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,363
- You think? Not too short-waisted? - No! You get
a little snakeskin belt, give it a little texture.

1119
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:31,404
- Oh, that's a good idea. I like this too.
- Hey!

1120
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:34,330
Will ya? Come on, now. Just take the
blouse. Keep 'em. They're on the house.

1121
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:37,749
- Now, you gotta make this phone call. - Oh, thanks,
Frank. - Get on the phone, and let's get going here.

1122
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:42,046
Right. Right, right, right. Okay, who are
we gonna call? The New York Times. Huh?

1123
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:46,378
- No. We'll call the president.
- Oh, yeah! That's really a call he's gonna take.

1124
01:22:46,468 --> 01:22:50,087
"Hi, we're two struggling actresses.
We're saving the world." Get real.

1125
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:53,431
He was an actor.

1126
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:55,426
Okay, the FBI.

1127
01:22:56,979 --> 01:23:01,143
We're gonna call the FBI, we're gonna
turn this in, we're gonna save our country.

1128
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:03,475
Uh-huh. Do you have a changing room?

1129
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:08,488
This doesn't work.

1130
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:15,156
They must have cut me off.

1131
01:23:15,247 --> 01:23:18,367
- I owe 'em a little money.
- Don't you know how to deal with those dorks?

1132
01:23:18,459 --> 01:23:21,459
- You don't have to pay them anything.
- You don't?

1133
01:23:21,545 --> 01:23:23,917
- No, all you have
to do... - No! - What?

1134
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:26,212
No, not that again.

1135
01:23:30,554 --> 01:23:33,974
Frank, how do we get
to a phone that works?

1136
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:34,472
Frank, how do we get
to a phone that works?

1137
01:23:34,558 --> 01:23:38,176
Okay, ladies, this here's Frodo.
He'll take real good care of ya.

1138
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:41,888
Now, you're gonna ride across those hills
till you come to the edge of a cliff.

1139
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:44,520
Don't go off there.
That's a 700-foot drop.

1140
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:50,280
Now, if you do get down, you're gonna come to the
rattlesnake area. Be real careful goin' through there.

1141
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:53,569
Now, take a left at the rattlesnakes
and you'll come around to a dirt road.

1142
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:57,243
Take you right into the taco stand.
They got a phone in there. Huh?

1143
01:23:57,331 --> 01:24:00,201
It couldn't be just a block and
a half to the corner store, Frank?

1144
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:02,665
Not around here.

1145
01:24:02,753 --> 01:24:05,956
- Hey, Frank, thanks.
- Oh, okay, all right.

1146
01:24:06,048 --> 01:24:07,875
- Now, come on, we gotta... - We
won't forget you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1147
01:24:07,967 --> 01:24:10,375
- We're gonna see you get something out of this, Frank.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

1148
01:24:10,469 --> 01:24:13,802
I'll be showered with money. I can hardly
wait. Come on, let's get outta here.

1149
01:24:13,889 --> 01:24:16,131
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. I don't have the toxin.

1150
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:19,428
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, hold on a second there.

1151
01:24:24,858 --> 01:24:27,266
Give me the vial.

1152
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:30,030
Slowly.

1153
01:24:33,283 --> 01:24:35,988
- Let go of me!
- Go!

1154
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:45,828
Whoa! Asshole! Come on!

1155
01:24:45,921 --> 01:24:48,329
Well, of course.

1156
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:53,260
Russell! Boyd!

1157
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:54,756
- Where's the other one?
- She got away.

1158
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:57,420
- Now you're gonna make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to drive a stick shift.

1159
01:24:57,516 --> 01:25:00,351
- Get in the back.
- Oh.

1160
01:25:12,615 --> 01:25:17,691
Let's turn around, okay?
Let's just go this way.

1161
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,372
Holy shit.

1162
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:33,131
Go away!

1163
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:35,923
- Frank?
- Go away!

1164
01:25:36,013 --> 01:25:38,883
- What happened? Where's Lauren?
- They took her.

1165
01:25:38,974 --> 01:25:41,382
- We gotta go find her.
- Oh, no!

1166
01:25:41,477 --> 01:25:44,763
Frank, I can't track her without
you. Now, please, come on!

1167
01:25:44,855 --> 01:25:48,271
- You go! I'm busy bleeding!
- Frank!

1168
01:25:48,358 --> 01:25:53,316
You don't give up, do ya? You think I'm gonna go
chasing a pack of psychos for some dumb blonde?

1169
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:56,110
She's not dumb, and she's not a blonde.

1170
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,450
- Well, good luck, lady.
- Frank!

1171
01:25:59,537 --> 01:26:01,328
Frank!

1172
01:26:06,752 --> 01:26:11,129
Okay, okay, the truth.

1173
01:26:11,214 --> 01:26:15,793
Lauren and I pulled a bank job. Those guys
were feds, and Lauren buried the money...

1174
01:26:15,886 --> 01:26:19,718
- Spare me, will ya?
- Well, what about revenge?

1175
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:22,761
I mean, these guys trashed your
house. Don't you want to get even?

1176
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:26,552
I'm insured. No deductible.
Save your breath.

1177
01:26:28,315 --> 01:26:33,061
I'm running out of bullshit,
Frank. They're gonna kill her.

1178
01:26:33,153 --> 01:26:35,360
I know it's not your problem...

1179
01:26:35,447 --> 01:26:39,397
but this person and I, we've been through
a lot of disgusting things together.

1180
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:41,901
This person and I are...

1181
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:48,206
This person's a friend...

1182
01:26:48,293 --> 01:26:52,208
and I don't have that many friends.

1183
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:58,429
I do.

1184
01:26:58,429 --> 01:26:59,627
I do.

1185
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:15,687
Hello, Michael. This is Atkins.

1186
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,531
Hello, Joe. Do you have the money?

1187
01:27:18,615 --> 01:27:21,153
Yep, it's here.

1188
01:27:21,243 --> 01:27:23,532
Fine. Here it is.

1189
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:30,205
You'll get into the chopper and fly to
Mesa Azul Cliffs at the Four Fingers.

1190
01:27:30,294 --> 01:27:34,042
Don't even think about ground
support because I've got lookouts.

1191
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:39,754
Now, if I see a plane, a tank, a
chopper other than your chopper...

1192
01:27:39,845 --> 01:27:44,257
I'll get very nervous and I'm gonna dump this
stuff in the first stiff wind blowing east.

1193
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:47,220
You got it?

1194
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:50,062
You will not land the chopper.

1195
01:27:50,147 --> 01:27:54,311
You'll come level with the mesa and
you'll lower the money down to me...

1196
01:27:54,401 --> 01:27:56,975
at 5.:00 p.m. Exactly.

1197
01:28:11,418 --> 01:28:14,206
And now you're gonna make the exchange.

1198
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:17,463
I knew you wouldn't keep
your end of the bargain.

1199
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,502
This is your big moment.
Don't you wanna do it yourself?

1200
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:27,932
Atkins is a crack shot.

1201
01:28:28,018 --> 01:28:30,972
Like I said, I'm doing the exchange.

1202
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:38,683
- I see somebody. It's Lauren.
- Now you wanna tell me how much you believe them?

1203
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:43,026
No, don't shoot. Sir,
she's being coerced.

1204
01:29:31,624 --> 01:29:34,494
- Will you land this damn thing!
- He's trying!

1205
01:29:51,143 --> 01:29:54,559
Throw down the bag.

1206
01:29:54,646 --> 01:29:57,980
- Throw it down.
- You'll shoot me.

1207
01:29:58,066 --> 01:30:00,308
I'm really sorry about this.

1208
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:23,296
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1209
01:30:24,885 --> 01:30:28,752
- Aren't you dead yet?
- Not till I play Hamlet.

1210
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:36,762
- Boy!
- Oh, you came back.

1211
01:30:36,855 --> 01:30:39,643
- Sure!
- I can't believe it.

1212
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:42,188
- And look at you. You made off with the works.
- Yes.

1213
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:46,939
- I got the toxin and $20 million.
- Wow!

1214
01:30:47,032 --> 01:30:49,606
This time l... l-I think
I'll hold the money.

1215
01:30:49,702 --> 01:30:52,821
- You don't mind.
- Oh, look, there's Weldon.

1216
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:55,535
Maybe we can hitch a ride
with those guys. Hey, handsome!

1217
01:30:58,752 --> 01:31:01,956
- Go! Go!
- Go where?

1218
01:31:20,899 --> 01:31:23,900
I will never...

1219
01:31:23,986 --> 01:31:27,520
date a man again.

1220
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:39,333
- Sandy.
- Getting laid just isn't worth it.

1221
01:31:39,418 --> 01:31:41,790
Oh, Sandy!

1222
01:31:43,797 --> 01:31:47,213
Get it! Get it!

1223
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,179
Pull!

1224
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,227
Pull! Oh!

1225
01:32:00,522 --> 01:32:02,930
There is no God.

1226
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,114
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!

1227
01:32:49,154 --> 01:32:51,562
Yes. Let's go.

1228
01:32:53,909 --> 01:32:56,400
- Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.

1229
01:33:08,174 --> 01:33:11,376
You son of a bitch! En garde!

1230
01:33:12,427 --> 01:33:14,716
- Yes!
- Go!

1231
01:33:35,326 --> 01:33:38,825
- Where is it? Shit.
- I don't have it!

1232
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:42,496
I have it. Let her go.

1233
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,908
No! You...

1234
01:33:48,797 --> 01:33:51,205
Shit.

1235
01:33:55,971 --> 01:33:57,762
Ah, nuts.

1236
01:34:49,983 --> 01:34:52,190
Oh, shit!

1237
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,346
Nine years of ballet, asshole!

1238
01:35:29,731 --> 01:35:31,771
You did it! You did it!

1239
01:35:39,408 --> 01:35:42,658
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1240
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:10,432
That is the best Hamlet ever.

1241
01:36:12,107 --> 01:36:14,598
Except for mine.

1242
01:36:17,613 --> 01:36:20,981
Wow! Yeah!

1243
01:36:36,215 --> 01:36:39,797
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.

1244
01:36:39,885 --> 01:36:43,052
- They bought that shit.
- Sh... "Shit"?

1245
01:36:43,138 --> 01:36:46,139
You're calling my Hamlet shit?

1246
01:36:46,225 --> 01:36:49,060
He's a wimp. I mean, look at him. He
can't make up his mind about anything.

1247
01:36:49,145 --> 01:36:52,596
He stands around all night and says,
"What'll I do? What'll I do? What'll I do?"

1248
01:36:52,689 --> 01:36:56,557
Give me Romeo or Henry the Fifth.
Now, there's a guy I could boff.

1249
01:36:56,652 --> 01:36:59,439
Boff? Oh, we're back to boffing, are we?

1250
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:03,776
- I see. That's... That's the criteria for your great...
- Absolutely!

1251
01:37:03,868 --> 01:37:05,990
Right, whether you would boff the hero.

1252
01:37:06,078 --> 01:37:10,290
Well, who will you go to

1253
01:37:10,374 --> 01:37:14,538
When there's no one to betray

1254
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:16,288
And I said

1255
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,669
Who will you go to

1256
01:37:18,757 --> 01:37:22,376
When your best friend turns away

1257
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:24,177
Hey, hey

1258
01:37:24,263 --> 01:37:26,089
Last time you're gonna let me down

1259
01:37:26,182 --> 01:37:29,266
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1260
01:37:29,352 --> 01:37:32,387
It's the last time

1261
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,472
Last time you're gonna let me down

1262
01:37:34,565 --> 01:37:37,601
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1263
01:37:37,693 --> 01:37:40,777
It's the last time, baby

1264
01:37:40,863 --> 01:37:42,902
Last time you're gonna let me down

1265
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:46,026
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1266
01:37:46,118 --> 01:37:49,202
It's the last time

1267
01:37:49,288 --> 01:37:51,197
Last time you're gonna let me down

1268
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:54,375
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1269
01:37:54,459 --> 01:37:56,702
It's the last time, baby

1270
01:37:56,795 --> 01:38:00,709
There's a garden full of roses

1271
01:38:00,799 --> 01:38:04,963
There's a necklace full of pearls

1272
01:38:05,054 --> 01:38:09,597
You have come to take the roses

1273
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:13,348
To give to other girls

1274
01:38:13,437 --> 01:38:18,016
Well, I'm just a pretty thing

1275
01:38:18,108 --> 01:38:21,691
You wanted for a day

1276
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:25,907
There is nothing left between us

1277
01:38:25,991 --> 01:38:29,443
There is nothing left to say

1278
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:31,245
Hey, hey

1279
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:33,287
Last time you're gonna let me down

1280
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:36,410
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1281
01:38:39,588 --> 01:38:41,628
Last time you're gonna let me down

1282
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:44,882
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

1283
01:38:53,269 --> 01:38:56,388
It's the last time
