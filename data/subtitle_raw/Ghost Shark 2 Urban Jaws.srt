1
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,625
I've never seen anything like it, Mayor.

2
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:28,050
Not in 35 years of law enforcement.

3
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,041
I think we` got a serial killer on our hands!

4
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,291
Call me back when you get this message.

5
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,917
You know, Tony, I know a guy at Work & Income,
might be able to help you.

6
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,217
Work and Income?!

7
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,125
Go to hell, "Mayor Broody."

8
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,041
I’m not being Mayor Broody right now.

9
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,083
Just your friend.

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,125
Jack.

11
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,333
You know I’m no good to anyone.

12
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:56,962
I’m washed up.

13
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,133
I’m through!

14
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,175
Now what kind of talk is that?

15
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,041
Hell, you’ve got more naval experience
than anyone in this country.

16
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,834
I don’t think anyone wants my naval experience, Jack.

17
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,125
Don’t feed the fish.

18
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,125
Please.

19
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,542
Ghost Shark can’t hurt you anymore, Tony.

20
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,008
Certainly not here.

21
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,959
- You don’t know that!
- Look, that happened a long time ago.

22
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,650
We defeated him.

23
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,375
You’re safe.

24
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,542
You don’t know that.

25
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,375
Still going to your meetings?

26
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,750
Fuck you, Jack!

27
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,375
Stale coffee and a circle-jerk
isn’t my idea of a night out.

28
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,500
Those people are there to help you.

29
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,125
You think anyone can help me, Jack?

30
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,291
I’m a lost soul in a sea full of shit.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,417
- Tony, I...
- I can't even remember what life was like before that goddamn ghost shark.

32
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,625
None of us can, Tony.

33
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,625
None of us can.

34
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,883
What do you want?

35
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,083
Mayor Broody, they say there’s a killer
on the loose. Will you make a statement?

36
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:26,258
- That’s preposterous.
- But Mayor, they say he drowns his victims!

37
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,375
The police will make a statement later this afternoon.
Now, if you don’t mind…

38
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,834
But Mayor, is this going to affect your campaign for another term

39
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,792
in the forthcoming election?
- Get the fuck out of my face!

40
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,792
Fuck!

41
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,166
Commissioner Goldfarb speaking.

42
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,708
Two more deaths, already?

43
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:36,041
Ira, tell those boys in your office
to start doing their damn jobs.

44
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,375
We’re trying as hard as we can, Jack,
but we’re stumped!

45
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,041
Aren’t you guys forensic professionals?
Run some tests or something!

46
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,333
We have! But we don’t know what to
make of the results!

47
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,375
Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.

48
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,375
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

49
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,458
How did they die?

50
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,708
Just like the others, Mayor:

51
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,875
DROWNED!

52
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,375
And what state were they in
when you found them?

53
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,166
That’s the bizarre thing.

54
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,417
It was like they’d been dead for weeks!

55
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,041
Mayor Broody?

56
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,917
Listen, Ira.

57
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
These details can’t get out, okay?

58
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,000
This is strictly between us.

59
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,959
What’s going on, Mayor?

60
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,125
Ira, do you remember when we first met?

61
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,625
I told you I’d seen some strange things.

62
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:29,208
But I didn’t say what things, or how strange.

63
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,583
I can’t keep it a secret any longer.

64
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,208
Back when I lived in Port Isabel…

65
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
The city was attacked by a great white shark…

66
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,792
…from beyond the grave.

67
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,792
- Mayor, what are you—
- I know it sounds ridiculous…

68
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:48,750
…but frankly, we don’t have time
for incredulity right now.

69
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:53,083
Everyone in Port Isabel died that summer.
- Tony!

70
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,625
After what we did, I didn’t think there was
any way Ghost Shark could’ve survived.

71
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,208
But it looks like he’s back.

72
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,250
I need you all over this, Ira!

73
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,208
We need expert assistance, and fast.
- “Expert assistance?”

74
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,583
What am I supposed to do, look in the yellow pa—

75
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,208
I don’t care what you have to do!

76
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,000
Find someone who’s qualified.

77
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,375
I don’t care how many dirty favours it takes.

78
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,834
I’m already on it, Mayor.

79
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,875
Help me, Tommy!

80
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,625
Tommy, help me!

81
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,250
Help me please, Tommy, help me!

82
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,917
Emily!

83
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,792
Please, Tommy!

84
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,583
Emily!

85
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,333
Tommy, please!

86
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,708
God damn ghost shaaaaaaarrrrrrr-

87
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,667
What do you mean, New Zealand?

88
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,754
Mayor Broody has done a fabulous job of governing

89
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,708
our beautiful city of Auckland for the past 3 years.

90
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,625
But he belongs to an old school of politics.

91
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,542
A school that doesn’t serve modern,

92
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,458
forward thinking individuals like you or me.

93
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,417
Mayor Broody is last year’s news.

94
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,333
This October, when you’re voting for your new mayor, hey!

95
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,375
Give the new guy a go.

96
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,917
Vote for me, Marco Guerra, and you’re voting

97
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,166
for a new and better tomorrow.

98
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,667
Ahhh, what a douche-dick.

99
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,542
Hey asshole! Wanna turn that shit up?

100
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,750
You’re stuck in the past, man. Move on.

101
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,375
The safety of my people
has always been my primary concern.

102
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,041
What was it you said in that council meeting?

103
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,166
Prosperity comes second?

104
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,333
Who doesn’t want prosperity? Am I right?

105
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,500
Well, the forthcoming International Water Convention

106
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
promises to bring a boatload of tourist trade

107
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,542
plus jobs, obviously, to build
the main concourse and aquadome.

108
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,667
And what about this serial killer?

109
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,208
The Freeman’s Bay Drowner?

110
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,792
Is that all you people care about?

111
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,458
We’ve had four murders so far,

112
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,083
and your police department has refused
to give any official details.

113
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,125
So much for “the safety of the people,” huh?

114
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,500
- I assure you, Commissioner Goldfarb and his team

115
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,041
are working around the clock to see that
whoever or whatever it is is brought to justice.

116
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,667
What’s so complicated about solving a murder
in this day and age?

117
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,959
- Significantly more than you might think.

118
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,667
Hey! Jack!

119
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,250
You know I meant no offense in there, right?

120
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,125
Yeah, I know. Gotcha.

121
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,792
Gotta do what you gotta do.

122
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,750
Politics.

123
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,625
Exactly.

124
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,417
I’m going home - are we still on
for lunch tomorrow?

125
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,750
Oh, you betcha!

126
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,792
See you tomorrow.
- Look forward to it, brother.

127
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,875
Oh - give my regards to your little girl!

128
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,667
I will! Goodnight!

129
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,125
Thank you. That’s probably
the best steak I’ve ever had.

130
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,959
I’m glad we did this.
- Me too.

131
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,792
I really should get out more. It’s…

132
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,917
It’s so pathetic.

133
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:44,834
Yeah.

134
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,708
What are you up to after this?

135
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,166
Why?

136
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,500
Broody here. What you got?

137
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,417
I got a professional in.

138
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,708
They call him the Ghost Shark Hunter.

139
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:07,375
They say he hasn’t bathed in nine years!

140
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,291
He’s here?
- I’m lookin’ at him right now!

141
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,375
I’m on my way.

142
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,708
Oh!

143
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,458
God, you scared the bejeezus out of me.

144
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,166
Sorry.

145
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,834
Jack Broody. Mayor of the Auckland supercity.

146
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,208
You must be the ghost shark hunter.

147
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,375
Is Ira here?

148
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,792
This your wife?

149
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,250
Gimme that!

150
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,125
So, um…

151
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,166
Ira tells me you haven’t bathed for nine years.

152
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,008
Do the ladies go for that?

153
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,166
Let’s not piss around the pool, mayor.

154
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,375
Right.

155
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,583
Let’s back up the boat here a bit.

156
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,917
How exactly does one become
an “expert ghost shark hunter”?

157
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,708
I mean, really - how many could there be?

158
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,208
Want me to count ‘em for you?

159
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,708
- Well, yeah.
- One.

160
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,708
- I mean, no.
- Two.

161
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,291
Three.
- What?

162
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,458
Four.

163
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:19,834
Five.

164
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,542
Six.

165
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:23,708
Six?

166
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,625
THOUSAND!

167
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,125
And that’s only the ones on record.

168
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:34,125
And you’ve been hunting them all these years?

169
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,583
Oh god, Tony.

170
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,667
There’s somebody I’d like you to meet.

171
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:04,250
C’mon, you stupid fish.

172
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,375
Hey Jack.

173
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,917
Who’ve you brought with you this time?

174
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,333
Another god damn therapist?

175
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,166
Tony, this is Tom Logan. He’s a…

176
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,375
…ghost shark hunter.

177
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,041
Ghost shark hunter? Ghost shark hunter?!

178
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,500
Jack, what’s a ghost shark hunter doing here?

179
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,667
You know about this serial killer?

180
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,750
The Freeman’s Bay Drowner.

181
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,125
Son of a bitch!

182
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,125
I’m afraid so.
- No!

183
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,375
No! No!

184
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,166
We killed him, Jack!

185
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,959
We killed him! He was dead! I saw him!

186
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,083
God damn it, Jack.

187
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,500
What are we gonna do?!
- Tony, please!

188
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,708
It wasn’t the only ghost shark.

189
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,041
What?!

190
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,917
Apparently there’s…

191
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,500
Thousands.

192
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,291
Thousands?!

193
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,208
Jesus Christ, Jack.

194
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,375
He can swim through water.

195
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,417
He can swim through ice!

196
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,708
God damn motherfucker can even swim through steam!

197
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:16,875
- I’m sure Mr. Logan is aware of that.
- Oh, so you’re a big professional ghost shark hunter, huh?

198
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,667
That’s why Mr. Logan is here. To kill this thing.

199
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,333
He flew in this morning.

200
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,917
- You come here by plane?

201
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,917
Yeah.

202
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,625
Smart kid.

203
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,041
We gotta get on to it.

204
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,208
Be safe. Okay?

205
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,959
Ghost Shark’s gonna kill you.

206
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,583
He’s gonna kill us all!

207
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,708
We’re all doomed!

208
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,333
Auckland is doomed. Doomed, I tell ya!

209
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,792
He’s gonna swim through and get us all.

210
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,125
Throw us all in the drink!

211
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,875
We’re all doomed!

212
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,000
Tony was a Navy commander.

213
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,166
Managed to kill one of those bastards.

214
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,542
Damn near killed himself in the attempt.

215
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,708
Logan, I’ll be straight with you.
I don’t like to waste time.

216
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,166
How long will it take for you to
make this damn thing dead?

217
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,708
Permanently?

218
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,208
Name your price. Whatever you want.

219
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,250
Money. Women.

220
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,959
Real estate.

221
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,583
Drugs.

222
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,875
Weapons. You want somebody out of jail?
I can do it.

223
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,417
Thought you said you didn’t like to waste time.

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,333
So you’ll do it?

225
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,250
I’ll think about it.

226
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,583
Tommy.

227
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,583
Tommy?
- I’m not listening to you.

228
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,667
You know, they’re kinda like us.
- What?

229
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:52,375
- Dandelions.
- Oh yeah? - Yeah!

230
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,083
I mean, the seeds of a dandelion

231
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,333
can travel hundreds of miles if the winds are right.

232
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,708
They’re like tiny parachutes searching for a new home,

233
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,875
and sometimes,

234
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,041
if the winds allow it,

235
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,458
they find a new dandelion to land beside,

236
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,208
and grow.

237
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,458
- Tommy, I…
- Emily Morgan?

238
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,959
Will you marry me?

239
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,208
Tommy, I love you.

240
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,834
But I live in New Zealand.

241
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,500
I’m going back there next week. I can’t.
- Then take me with you.

242
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,667
- Really?
- Really!

243
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,792
Tommy, of course I’ll marry you!

244
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,458
Let’s get packing.

245
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,083
Tommy!

246
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,208
What are you doing here?
- I just want to talk to you.

247
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,208
- Who’s that?
- Nobody, dear.

248
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,959
- I just need to explain.
- I want you to leave.

249
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,291
- But I -
- I said I want you to leave.

250
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,050
You! I know you!

251
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,250
You’re the boy who’s gonna marry our Emily!

252
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,500
Gerald, why don’t you go and get Thomas a drink?

253
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,500
I’m sure he must be thirsty.

254
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,333
Pick you for a bourbon man, am I right?

255
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,125
It’ll take him fifteen minutes
to find the liquor cabinet.

256
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,291
- Please.
- And by that time he’ll have forgotten you were even here. - Look!

257
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,792
I’m sorry about Emily.

258
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,959
- You’re apologising?!
- I didn’t kill her!

259
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,000
How dare you?

260
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:02,041
Emily’s dead and there’s not a thing you can do about it!

261
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,041
You want to make it right, do you, Thomas?

262
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,250
Well go back to your own country
and your own family

263
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,333
And stop causing this one any more pain!

264
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,625
I have no family.

265
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,750
Dad, when’s lunch going to be ready?

266
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,792
Shouldn’t be too long.

267
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,125
It’s just about done.

268
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,875
Dad?

269
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,500
But seriously, Mayor…

270
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:34,000
What are your plans for the
International Water Convention?

271
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,959
You know, Marco,
I’ve been thinking about that.

272
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,458
I think I’m gonna cancel.

273
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,375
Jack, you can’t be serious.

274
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,542
I am serious, Marco.

275
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:07,959
We’ve got a serial killer on the loose
who drowns people.

276
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,750
Think about it. At a water convention?

277
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,041
It’d be like a fat kid
at a free cake bakery.

278
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,291
But Mayor!

279
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,458
If you cancel the International Water Convention

280
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,542
The economic impact will be devastating.

281
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,375
I know, but think about —

282
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,959
Sorry, what’s your little girl’s name again?
- Mart—

283
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,834
Got a minute mayor?
- Tom, what are you doing in here?

284
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,875
‘Cause I’m about ready to
get my god damn feet wet.

285
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,083
Jack, who the hell is this guy?
- He’s no one.

286
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,041
So you’re just gonna let him barge in?
- No, look –

287
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,583
Tom, I’m in the middle of a meeting.

288
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,667
Steppin’ on your toes, Mayor?
- No –

289
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,500
‘Cause I’d hate to step on your toes.

290
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,166
Okay, what the hell is going on, man?

291
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,166
This is Tom Logan. He’s, uh…

292
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,375
…an advisor.
- I see.

293
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,917
So?

294
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,375
Tom…

295
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,959
Anything you need. Just…

296
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,750
God damn it, Tom,
I’m in the middle of a meeting!

297
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,250
Well.

298
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,041
Now that we’re all…

299
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,458
Nice and cosy.

300
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,667
So, Jack…

301
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,083
What exactly is he advising you on?

302
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,875
Water safety.

303
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,291
Oh my God!

304
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:40,083
It was a close call, Ira.

305
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,667
Marco almost found out about Ghost Shark.

306
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,750
Marco?
- Jack!

307
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,291
If you value our friendship,

308
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,083
You’d better start talking,
or I swear to God—

309
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,291
Marco, take it easy.

310
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,917
You want me to take it easy, Jack?

311
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,583
You don’t know what I’ve seen!
- Logan, no!

312
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:57,333
If you follow me again, I’ll tie a fish around
your balls and feed your dick to a sea lion.

313
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,166
You! You sent your lapdog to spy on me?

314
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,792
Hey! I’m nobody’s lapdog.

315
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,333
You think I’m a coward?

316
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,625
If I was gonna spy on you, I’d do it myself.

317
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,583
Jack, it doesn’t matter who followed whom!

318
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,542
He conjured some sort of…

319
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,583
…shark ghost!
- Ghost Shark! - What?

320
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,333
Marco, there’s something I haven’t told you.

321
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,792
It’s not a serial killer on the loose.

322
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,792
What we have on our hands…

323
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,667
…is a Ghost Shark.

324
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,250
An undead beast that feeds on the souls
of those of us who dare to walk on the land.

325
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,458
So cancelling the
International Water Convention…

326
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,542
Was it because of this shark ghost?

327
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,708
Ghost Shark.

328
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,041
Is there a way to get rid of a Ghost Shark?

329
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,125
There is one way.

330
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,959
What are you implying?

331
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,625
I thought you said you’d killed
thousands of these things.

332
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,667
Sure. Ghost hammerheads, ghost makos…

333
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,625
…even ghost ghost sharks.

334
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,542
But this is a ghost Great White.

335
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,375
Like the one in Port Isabel.

336
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,041
You’ve seen one of these before.

337
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,333
You killed the Port Isabel
Great White Ghost Shark?

338
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,792
Marco, could you wait outside, please?

339
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,041
Marco!

340
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,542
Sure, Jack.

341
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,375
No problem.

342
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:31,000
What I’m about to tell you…

343
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,750
…never leaves this office,
do you understand?

344
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,083
Back in Port Isabel…

345
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:39,208
Tony!

346
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,583
Christ, I can’t even bring myself to say it.

347
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,959
- I heard about this.

348
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,250
You set off a nuclear bomb.

349
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,792
You killed thousands.

350
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,500
We had to make a call!

351
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,417
Tony had access to a submarine.

352
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,792
The gutters were clogged
with the ghost shark-mangled dead.

353
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:02,000
Please don’t tell me we have to do that again.

354
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,959
Not here.

355
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,333
Hate to break it to you, Mayor…

356
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,291
Nuke didn’t kill Ghost Shark.
- What?

357
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:14,041
All those people…
- It was an electromagnetic pulse.

358
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,834
Side effect of the blast.

359
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,083
Sends your Ghost Shark right back to Hades.

360
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,542
Oh God…

361
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,625
We do have another option.

362
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:24,458
An explosively pumped flux compression generator.

363
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,708
Generates an EMP without any of the fallout.

364
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,208
I can build one myself.

365
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,834
No, Logan.

366
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,417
An EMP would cut power to half the city.

367
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,834
Not half the city, Mayor; all of it.

368
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,667
No, Logan. Think of all the elderly
and sick on life support.

369
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,291
Without power, people will die.

370
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,250
Without an EMP, everyone will die!
- No!

371
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,583
I won’t sanction it.

372
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,708
Not even if there’s a god damn
Ghost Shark on the loose.

373
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,917
Not this time!

374
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,125
Then I’ll call the florist.

375
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,959
What do you mean, a florist?

376
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,458
For the flower arrangements.

377
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,667
For the funeral.

378
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,083
Because you’re gonna die.

379
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,250
Logan…

380
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,417
I understand your concern.

381
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,458
But I– - Love to stay and suck
your dick a little longer, Mayor…

382
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,959
But it’s kinda hard when your dick’s
turned into a pussy.

383
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,041
- Hey!
- Get out of my way.

384
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,375
So Jack…

385
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,625
What are you gonna do?

386
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:59,667
Go! Go! Yes! Come on!

387
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,375
- We interrupt your regular programming…
- What the fuck?

388
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,708
…to bring you this message from your mayor.

389
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,250
Change the channel.

390
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,875
It’s on every channel!

391
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,208
Unbelievable.

392
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,542
Beers. More beers. Hey!

393
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,333
You get ‘em. More beers!

394
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,083
When England are winning, you’ll be getting the beers.

395
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,083
Auckland is under siege from a
supernatural beast

396
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,000
known as Ghost Shark.

397
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,291
He is unmerciful.

398
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,583
He is unfeeling.

399
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,583
But he is not unstoppable.

400
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:48,917
It is with a heavy heart
that I have to announce my intention...

401
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,834
Fuckin’ pick up!

402
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:53,834
…to detonate an electromagnetic device
in the city.

403
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,417
It is the only way we can defeat
this Ghost Shark.

404
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:01,959
But it means we will have to come together,
as a people, to prepare.

405
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,291
Even now, our vital services are
preparing backup generators.

406
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:11,041
We would ask that you turn off as much
electrical equipment as possible.

407
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,708
If you leave the city…

408
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,583
…do it in a calm and orderly fashion.

409
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,917
And for God’s sake…

410
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,500
…stay out of the water.

411
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:24,000
The people of this city are a good people.

412
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:28,000
And I think... – No.

413
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,000
I know that Auckland will prevail.

414
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,625
So good luck, citizens.

415
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,542
You’re going to need it.

416
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,125
Two hundred straight in…

417
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,542
Two-fifty up the arse.

418
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,625
I just need to be held.

419
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,125
I can do that.

420
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,583
Tommy?

421
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,875
Emily.

422
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,291
You can call me whatever you want.

423
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,750
I miss you so much.

424
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,166
I miss you too.

425
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,500
I miss your voice.

426
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:58,875
Me too.

427
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,667
Can I kiss you?

428
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:01,750
What?

429
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,875
No…

430
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,667
It doesn’t work like that.

431
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,041
I love you, Emily.

432
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,542
No! It doesn’t work like that.

433
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,250
I love you, Emily!

434
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,000
What’s the matter with you?

435
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:18,917
Just leave.

436
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,000
You’re fucking crazy.

437
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,875
I said, leave.

438
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,500
Take a shower, you dick.

439
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,750
Tom!

440
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,917
Son!

441
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,625
You can’t blame yourself.

442
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,792
I didn’t even get to say goodbye.

443
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,834
Son, I know you’re grieving.

444
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,750
But that’s how Ghost Sharks are.

445
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,250
The only wake they leave is one of

446
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,708
death, anguish, and broken dreams.

447
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,125
God damn Ghost Shark.

448
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,708
You know,

449
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:41,041
I talk about Ghost Sharks and
people think I’m crazy.

450
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:45,375
But when you’re looking into the cold,
dead eyes of a Ghost Shark…

451
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:50,000
Your definition of crazy begins to change.

452
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,417
I can’t keep hunting them forever, Tom.

453
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,917
You’ve gotta finish what I started.

454
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,583
How do you even kill a Ghost Shark?

455
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,792
To kill a Great White Ghost Shark like this?

456
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,917
Only way to kill him

457
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,000
is with an electromagnetic pulse.

458
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,000
But you know what you really need, Tom?

459
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,166
Love.

460
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,875
It’ll take you to some dark places, sure,

461
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,834
but it’ll always bring you back.

462
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,708
Citizens are scrambling to be ready
for a power outage

463
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,083
after Mayor Broody today made
a bizarre series of statements

464
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,250
centring around the apparent presence

465
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,083
of a Ghost Shark in Auckland,

466
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,208
and culminating in the announcement of a plan

467
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,875
to detonate an electromagnetic pulse

468
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,208
to destroy it.

469
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,000
We’re now joined live by renowned

470
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,083
paranormal expert Dr. Paul Benson.

471
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,000
Good evening, Paul.
- Glad to be here.

472
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,333
How concerned should the average citizen be

473
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,625
about this Ghost Shark we’ve been warned about?

474
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,208
Very concerned, Rachel.

475
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,708
These are the ghosts of the millions of sharks

476
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,750
killed by the shark fin trade every year.

477
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,792
They combine the unpredictability

478
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,133
and thirst for vengeance of a ghost

479
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,917
with the ferocity and killer instinct
of a shark.

480
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,750
Basically the most dangerous creatures
on the planet.

481
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,333
That was Dr. Paul Benson.

482
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,000
But you can’t base your opinions

483
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,750
on those of one scientist,

484
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,834
so we sent David Farrier to the streets

485
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,375
to capture some of your thoughts.

486
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,542
What are your thoughts on Ghost Shark?

487
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,750
Ghost Shark?

488
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,291
I’ve never seen a Ghost Shark.

489
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,500
I think it’s a crock of shit.

490
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,750
It’s just another series of lies
from the mayor.

491
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,458
I think you’d have to be a moron
to believe something like that.

492
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,792
I mean, an EMP?

493
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,250
I think Broody’s really lost it this time.

494
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:28,041
So while Mayor Broody continues to worry
about a ghost shark,

495
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:31,917
the people of this city don’t seem too bothered.

496
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:35,417
Back to you in the studio.
- Turn that shit off!

497
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,041
What’s wrong with a little
investigative journalism?

498
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,375
Don’t tell me you believe in Ghost Shark.

499
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,500
I don’t need to believe.

500
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,625
I’ve seen Ghost Shark.

501
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,542
Okay, whatever.

502
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,583
Ghost Shark.

503
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,250
You got a problem, asshole?

504
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,792
Look mate, I work for the TV.

505
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,542
Oh, well that’s okay then.

506
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:03,458
If you work for the TV,
it’s almost a prerequisite.

507
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,208
Whatever.

508
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,417
Oh, that’s it.

509
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:09,917
Run away!

510
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:14,917
Hey!

511
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,250
Just leave me alone, man.

512
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,250
I’m talking to you, you bastard!

513
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,333
Mate, I said piss off.

514
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,208
It’s for your own good. Your own safety!

515
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,041
Okay then, tell me everything you know
about Ghost Shark.

516
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,166
You wanna know about Ghost Shark?

517
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,250
You really wanna know?

518
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,500
Son of a bitch killed my wife.

519
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,291
Killed my babies!

520
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,708
You ever think it might’ve been
their own fucking fault?

521
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,917
What did you say about my family?

522
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,083
Mate, I was joking.

523
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,375
What did you say?!
- I was joking!

524
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,583
God damn Ghost Shark!

525
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,375
Oh no.

526
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:55,041
Oh God. Oh Jesus Christ!

527
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,875
Come on. Wake up.

528
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:03,125
Get up, you bastard. Come on!

529
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,166
Wake up! Wake up!

530
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,542
God damn Ghost Shark!

531
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,375
Hey, you alright?

532
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,083
Fuck off!

533
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:23,458
Fuck off!

534
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,458
Jack.

535
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,959
Jack, I fucked up.

536
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,125
I killed a man!

537
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,166
No. Fuck.

538
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,917
Jack.

539
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,750
You know how you said

540
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,750
you’d support me through anything?

541
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,708
Oh, fuck. No.

542
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,708
No. Fuck. Fuck!

543
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,208
Thank you.

544
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:51,166
God damn Ghost Shark!

545
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,917
Tony’s gone.

546
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,125
What do we do, Tom?

547
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,254
You know what we need to do.
- We’re not ready yet!

548
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:57,542
You think Ghost Shark gives a fuck
about your timetable?

549
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,667
We need this EMP right now, Mayor!

550
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,166
You don’t understand.

551
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,625
I can’t have that blood on my hands.

552
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,542
Not again!

553
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,041
You wanna hear about blood, Mayor?
- Oh please.

554
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:09,917
I coulda lived in this beautiful country
with a beautiful bride,

555
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,250
but a Ghost Great White killed her, Mayor.

556
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,917
Snatched her away from me.

557
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,375
And this is the closest I’ve come
to my retribution.

558
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,208
You don’t understand.

559
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,208
Without the backup generators up and running,

560
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,166
I can’t condone that kind of action.

561
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,792
And what about inaction?

562
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:34,000
What?
- From a certain point of view…

563
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,125
…you let Tony die.

564
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,959
Now you listen to me.

565
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,500
I don’t care what kinda Ghost Shark
hunter you are.

566
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,542
I would never let Tony Palantine
come to any harm.

567
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,166
And don’t you dare suggest it!

568
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,667
He’s still dead.

569
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,291
I know.

570
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,041
You don’t have to remind me.

571
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,000
I don’t want the people of this city
to end up like Tony.

572
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,959
This is no time to quibble over ethics.

573
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,917
I don’t know how I’m gonna live with this,

574
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,750
but I’m gonna have to learn how to.

575
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,834
You ready to detonate?

576
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,834
Meet me at the dock in an hour.

577
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,291
Don’t be late.

578
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:39,667
Come on, Martina.

579
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,000
We’ve gotta get a move on.

580
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:43,500
Coming, Daddy.

581
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:46,500
Why can’t Mrs Stevenson look after me?

582
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,834
I just don’t want to let you out of
my sight, okay?

583
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,750
But I want to stay with Mrs Stevenson.

584
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,792
Come here. Just give Daddy a hug.

585
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,000
Look…

586
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:03,792
I know I haven’t been around much lately.

587
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,500
There’s no excuse for that.

588
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,625
I’ve been busy campaigning

589
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,417
and I’ve neglected the most important thing
in the world to me.

590
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:11,750
What’s that?

591
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,375
You, my little pumpkin pooch.

592
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,083
Will you forgive me?

593
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,959
I think Mummy would’ve been proud of you.

594
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:29,417
Come on Martina. We’ve gotta go.

595
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,542
Where are we going?

596
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,000
Out of the city.

597
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,500
Come on, you son of a bitch.

598
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,583
Can we stop for lollies?

599
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:01,667
Sorry, Martina. No candy until we get
out of Auckland.

600
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,250
But why not?

601
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,133
Because I said so.

602
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,542
It’s bad for your health, and —

603
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,000
Jack?

604
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,125
Martina.

605
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:18,250
You’ve got to stay here, understand?

606
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,083
God damn it Marco, what are you doing here?

607
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,333
I was leaving the city. What are
you doing here?

608
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:34,458
The backup generators aren’t online yet.

609
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,000
You fucking idiot!

610
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,792
Just don’t use language like that!

611
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,250
My daughter’s in the car.

612
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,417
What were you thinking?

613
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,291
You shouldn’t have brought her here,
it’s dangerous!

614
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,375
At least here I can keep an eye on her.

615
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,917
She’s my reason for living.

616
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,583
For doing everything that I do!

617
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,792
Hi, my darling.

618
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,708
Cute.

619
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,250
You!

620
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,708
I told you what I’d do!

621
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:18,041
Get ready, gentlemen.

622
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,458
Martina!

623
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,417
No. No!

624
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,875
No, Marco!

625
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,375
No!

626
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:46,000
The breeze served us admirably.

627
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,792
We skimmed before it like a bird,

628
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,208
the coast of the island flashing by

629
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,500
and the view changing every minute.

630
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,125
Soon, we were past –

631
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,458
Mom?

632
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:06,208
Mom?

633
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:15,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

634
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:41,041
Just a little longer, Tommy.

635
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,208
Come on!

636
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,792
The people are gonna be angry.

637
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,792
We can hide in my office.

638
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,959
Stop crying, little girl!

639
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:03,667
Ghost Shark can swim through tears.

640
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,250
Chaos across Auckland continues, due to

641
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,417
this morning’s complete power failure.

642
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:11,041
Although many areas have had
electricity restored,

643
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,959
thousands of families are still without power

644
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,375
and several deaths have been repor—

645
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:18,959
Hello, Jack.

646
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:21,166
Your time has come.

647
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,375
We’ve been watching you closely

648
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:26,458
and we do not approve.

649
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,125
You tried to sell us

650
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,875
on the delusion of a Ghost Shark

651
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:33,291
and innocent lives have been lost
as a result.

652
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,959
So you can run, Jack.

653
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,500
Yes, you can even hide.

654
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:43,166
But the People of a Free Auckland
will find you.

655
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,750
And when we do?

656
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,959
We will kill you.

657
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:58,583
What are you doing?
- Got it!

658
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,041
Who is it?

659
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,750
Routine inspection, sir.

660
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,625
Just need to check your fire alarms and
make sure everything’s still functional.

661
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:08,291
What?

662
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,125
It’s locked.

663
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,750
You unlock this door, or I’ll

664
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,333
skin you from head to motherfucking toe,
you bastard!

665
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,542
Don’t go.

666
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,834
I know he’s here. I have to find him.

667
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,625
Look around you, Tommy.

668
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,166
Who do you see?

669
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,667
Do you see Ghost Shark?

670
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,542
I only see you.

671
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,834
Exactly.

672
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:54,333
So come be with me.

673
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,208
Just relax.

674
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,083
Forget about your old life.

675
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,041
Join me.

676
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,250
You’re not Emily.

677
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,375
Well done, slow-swimmer.

678
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:32,500
Are you beginning to understand?

679
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,083
What is there to understand?

680
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,333
What your world is doing to ours!

681
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,959
For millions of years, we have
hunted our oceans.

682
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,542
But you cut off our fins

683
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,125
and throw us back in the water.

684
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,125
If we can’t swim, we die!

685
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,625
You know, I never thought it’d come to this.

686
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,458
Open this god damn door!

687
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,208
Trapped in my own office.

688
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,625
I’m scared.

689
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,208
I’m scared too.

690
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,375
Get the drill.

691
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,333
Don’t worry.

692
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,333
It’s me they’re after.

693
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,959
I’m not a nice person.

694
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,667
In fact, I’m a coward.

695
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:23,208
I say “it’s for the greater good.”

696
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,041
“It’s for the good of the people.”

697
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,417
But what does that even mean?

698
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:32,250
It’s all a lie.

699
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,959
And I’m a liar.

700
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:40,417
A selfish old bastard
without a bucket to shit in.

701
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,125
I mean, what does that say about a man?

702
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:47,792
I’m glad you’re here, Jack.

703
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,708
Well, Martina.

704
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,834
When they get in here,

705
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:55,500
make your dad proud.

706
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:57,708
Be brave.

707
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,708
Gotcha.
- Look, what is it that you want?

708
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,125
What are your demands?

709
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,333
Demands?

710
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:11,166
Fucker thinks we’ve got demands.
- Cut his throat, Jules!

711
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,208
I don’t understand.

712
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,792
What I did was for the good of the people!

713
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:18,041
It was for your own good. No one else’s.

714
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,834
But you don’t understand.

715
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,250
A Ghost Shark demands extreme measures.

716
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,917
A Ghost Shark demands –
- I agree.

717
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,583
A Ghost Shark does demand extreme measures.

718
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,708
Hand me my knife.

719
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,083
So.

720
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:06,542
Do you recognise this place, slow-swimmer?

721
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:09,542
This is the last place I saw Emily alive.

722
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:13,250
Did she scream for help, Tommy?

723
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,083
Did she scream?

724
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,792
I never got to say goodbye.

725
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,417
It’s okay, Tommy.

726
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,166
Just accept your fate.

727
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:28,125
It’ll be quick.

728
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,875
It always is.

729
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,417
You’re right.

730
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,542
What?
- You wanna kill me? Then kill me.

731
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:41,166
Just give me a few more seconds with her.

732
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,959
Whatever you need.

733
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:10,000
What are you doing?

734
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,000
You’re a shark.

735
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,375
If you can’t move…

736
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,667
You die.

737
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,834
No. No.

738
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,417
Goodbye, Emily.

739
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,750
What happened to your shirt?

740
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,917
Long story.

741
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,917
And Ghost Shark?

742
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,333
I said, long story.

743
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:50,875
I hope it has a happy ending.

744
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,333
Hey little girl.

745
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,792
What’s your name?
- Martina.

746
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,125
Well, Martina,

747
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,708
you’re safe now.

748
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,667
What’ll you do now?

749
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:06,125
I don’t know.

750
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,166
I know a guy at Work and Income.

751
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,458
Be seeing you, Mayor.

752
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,000
It’s been an honour.

753
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,583
Where is he going?

754
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:26,417
Mayor Broody?

755
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:18,667
But you know what you really need, Tom?

756
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,834
Love.

757
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,166
It’ll take you to some dark places, sure…

758
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:27,125
…but it’ll always bring you back.
