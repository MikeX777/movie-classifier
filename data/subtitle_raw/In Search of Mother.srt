00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,119
Stop!

12
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,395
Calm down! Listen to me!

13
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:39,165
Cut it out!
I'm severing my ties with you!

14
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,530
Don't be hasty!

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,531
Let me go!

16
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:51,944
Hanjiro, it was settled last
year when the boss was killed.

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,239
What good will it do for
you to start something?

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,182
What's going to happen
to my pride as a man?

19
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,116
What about our yakuza code of conduct?

20
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,655
I received my sakazuki
cup from Boss Shigezo!

21
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,592
I'm not like you, a traveling gambler!

22
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,722
What you say makes sense, but...

23
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,489
Have you thought about your
mother and sister back at home?

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,163
Well, have you?

25
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:23,977
I won't let my feelings about
my family get in the way!

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,205
Snap out of it!

27
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,107
What's so great about being a yakuza?

28
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,742
We're just outcasts of society.

29
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:39,758
Unlike me, who's an orphan,
you have a family and home.

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,151
Go straight!

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,888
Lead a decent life.

32
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,358
No!

33
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,570
I'm going to get revenge for the boss!

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,704
Get out of my way!

35
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,864
Hanjiro!

36
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,008
They're here.

37
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,510
Let me go!

38
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,216
Hanji! Don't die in vain!

39
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,849
Sukegoro! I'm here to
get revenge for my boss!

40
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,290
Prepare to die!

41
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,750
I shall assist!

42
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,931
Brother! You came to help!

43
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,523
Don't get hasty!

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,729
You have a mother and sister at home!

45
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,700
For their sakes, I can't let you die!

46
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,983
Sukegoro! Come out!

47
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,892
Don't worry about me.

48
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,460
Kill them both.

49
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,598
Or we'll be disgraced!

50
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,532
Sukegoro! Come back!

51
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,332
That's enough!

52
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,605
Enough! Let's go!

53
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,743
You bastards!

54
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,795
Okay. I'll do as you say.

55
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,197
My hometown, Kanamachi, is at
the other end of the crossing.

56
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,072
I'm an unfilial son that
didn't attend my dad's funeral.

57
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,749
I find it hard to go home.

58
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,348
Today is the day the
departed souls go home.

59
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,950
You can apologize to your
dead dad and your living mom.

60
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,622
That's true.

61
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,326
What are you going to do from now?

62
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,104
Do now...?

63
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,899
I'm going to Edo.

64
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,539
Edo?

65
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,982
Did you find out where your mom is?

66
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,891
I heard she might be in Edo.

67
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,485
But it's not definite.

68
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,028
It's worth going there.

69
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,965
The ferry is leaving!

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,976
I'll go to visit you one day.

71
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,684
Take care.

72
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,792
Brother...

73
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,702
I'll leave the money here.

74
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,226
Thank you.

75
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,669
Brother!

76
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,443
They must have taken the road to Mito!

77
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,206
Watch where you're going!

78
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,216
Hanjiro is from Kanamachi.

79
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,422
That road is a shortcut to Kanamachi.

80
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,684
All right, all right.

81
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,084
We are going there now.
Stop complaining.

82
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,057
We can't go back until
we kill both of them!

83
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,032
Anyone who defies the boss must die!

84
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,796
We'll kill the both of them together.

85
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,341
Surprise!

86
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,516
You scared me.

87
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,717
The dance is about to start.

88
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,685
Go and change quickly.

89
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,756
I can't go yet.
I will meet you there.

90
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,391
See? Wasn't I right?

91
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,158
Yes.

92
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,524
What is it?

93
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,093
Onui is going to the
dance with her loved one.

94
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,891
That's not true!

95
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,868
Who's the young man
who came this morning?

96
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,733
Isn't he your sweetheart?

97
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,134
No man came to see me.

98
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,073
But I saw him.

99
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,742
She saw him!

100
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,313
Come with him!

101
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,409
There's no one!

102
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,552
Hey, you!

103
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,399
Is this the house of Sobei in Kanamachi?

104
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,707
Sobei is my father,
who passed away last year.

105
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,174
We don't care about him.

106
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,605
My mother isn't home now.

107
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
The craftsmen are...

108
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,840
Your older brother,
Hanjiro, should be back!

109
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,185
We want to see him!

110
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,253
He left home a long time ago!

111
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,051
Don't give us that!

112
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,825
She's a pretty girl.
Be kind to her.

113
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,293
But Brother... She's lying!

114
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,233
The villagers saw Hanji!

115
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,563
Take it easy...

116
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:43,238
Miss, we have a letter for him.
Will you give it to him?

117
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,516
Hanji, we'll give you a couple of hours.

118
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,180
If you're a man, don't come late.

119
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,183
We should just storm in and kill him!

120
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,516
Stop.

121
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,329
I don't want to be accused of hurting

122
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,320
an old lady and girl, to get his head.

123
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,657
The village is having a bon dance!

124
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,167
We don't want to draw attention.

125
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,696
Let's go.

126
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,731
Come!

127
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,440
Hanji! You're trapped!

128
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,782
So give up!

129
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,779
Let's go.

130
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,389
Brother! What's that?

131
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,796
Show it to me!

132
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,495
It's nothing.

133
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,471
You can't read, so I'll read it for you.

134
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,666
Give it back.

135
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,972
Onui, give it back.

136
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,105
Onui!

137
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,241
Onui!

138
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,345
Give it back.

139
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,385
Brother! This letter is...

140
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,024
If I were an honest man,
I could run and hide.

141
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,224
Brother!

142
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:19,303
I live in the yakuza world.

143
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,271
I'm not a man if I don't
accept their challenge.

144
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,407
I'll be disgraced.

145
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,641
Understand?

146
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,852
No! Don't go!

147
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,146
Hanjiro!

148
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,549
Mom.

149
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,617
Where are you going?

150
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,094
Mom, he's in trouble.
Will you read this letter?

151
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,118
Hanjiro...

152
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,648
Haven't you given me enough grief?

153
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,356
You finally come home ...

154
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,557
And you have brought
with you a bloody battle.

155
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,094
I'm ashamed.

156
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,869
But mom...

157
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,376
I have to fight them as a man!

158
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,343
Shut up!

159
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,637
If that's the case...

160
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,576
don't be a man!

161
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,045
I'm glad you came home.

162
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,985
I'll set you straight.

163
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,679
I'm not letting you out.

164
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,391
See? That's why I stopped you.

165
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,557
I came home to lead a straight life.

166
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,802
But if they're challenging me...

167
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,326
Are you still saying that?!

168
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,370
If you insist on going...

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,173
then kill me first!

170
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,045
Hanjiro, go inside.

171
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,676
Go inside.

172
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,417
Go inside!

173
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,526
Excuse me...

174
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,490
Is this Hanjiro's house?

175
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm sorry to scare you.

176
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,675
Are you his younger sister?

177
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,072
Isn't your name Onui?

178
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,807
Has he said anything
about a guy named Chutaro?

179
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,284
He's not here!

180
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,122
He was disowned a long time ago!

181
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,191
I know that. I'm here to...

182
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,592
He's not here! Honestly!

183
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:24,374
He's lucky to have a loving sister like you.

184
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,879
I don't have time to spare.

185
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,052
I don't know who you are but...

186
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,216
Hanjiro was disowned.

187
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,218
He hasn't come here at all.

188
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,029
Please search elsewhere.

189
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,554
Are you his mother?

190
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,432
My name is Chutaro.

191
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,593
I'm Hanjiro's friend.

192
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,800
I won't cause you trouble.

193
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:58,807
Why are you here to see him,
when he's decided to go straight?

194
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:06,474
If you really are his friend,
then please leave him alone.

195
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,419
If he had a decent friend...

196
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,922
he wouldn't have gone bad like that.

197
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,694
I resent you men for it.

198
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,999
I understand.

199
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,242
I understand your feelings.

200
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,106
I will sever my ties with him.

201
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,947
Please rest assured.

202
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,315
Brother!

203
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,825
Hanji...

204
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:56,029
I'm envious of you for having a family.

205
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,604
You have no parents?

206
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,640
My dad died when I was 12.

207
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,916
I got separated from my
mom when I was five.

208
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,551
So I don't know what she looks like.

209
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,687
I don't know what it's
like to have parents.

210
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,155
That is why, I...

211
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,238
Hanji, stay in hiding for a while.

212
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,109
I promise to settle it with the Iioka gang.

213
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,172
Chutaro!

214
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,309
Brother!

215
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,014
Please let me go!

216
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,717
I can't let him die alone!

217
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,695
Don't put his kindness to naught.

218
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,201
I may safely escape this time,

219
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:07,935
but the persistent Iioka gang
will keep coming after me!

220
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,668
Brother!

221
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,366
Come!

222
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,938
You're hurting me!

223
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,074
Shut up!

224
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,510
What's the matter?

225
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,017
I'm coming.

226
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,558
Brother!

227
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,459
Hanji!

228
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,159
Get out of here!

229
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,633
Hanji!

230
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,880
What's the matter?
- Did they get away?

231
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,609
They're coming this way.

232
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,716
This way?

233
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,274
Chutaro is with him!

234
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,343
Hanji!

235
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,526
We can get rid of them at once!

236
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,187
Just where we want them!

237
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,293
Get ready!

238
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,439
Don't pick a fight with him,
when he's about to go straight!

239
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,740
Shut up! Out of our way!

240
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,264
That's not how it works, Miss.

241
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,612
If you let him go, after
he attacked our boss,

242
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,807
we won't be able to survive in our world.

243
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,449
Move!

244
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,351
Before we kill the both of you too!

245
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,619
I'm not moving!

246
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,677
Miss!

247
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,021
I'll make sure Hanji is safe!

248
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,814
I can't let you two get hurt!

249
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,994
Don't harm them.

250
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,364
Get them to move.

251
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,233
Both of you, move.

252
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,435
Miss, please leave!

253
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,459
Go!

254
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,037
Brother!

255
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,545
Hanjiro!

256
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,719
Hanji!

257
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,595
Stop it!

258
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,653
Hanji!

259
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,459
Hanji!

260
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,237
Come at me!

261
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,836
I'll be back!

262
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,921
I'll get you back for this!

263
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,792
Hanji...

264
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,670
Are you hurt?

265
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,365
I'm okay.

266
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,507
I'm glad...

267
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,352
I'm sorry for being rude to you earlier.

268
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,452
It's all right.

269
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:26,457
Is there any place he can hide for awhile?

270
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:30,365
Yes, he can go to my hometown.

271
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,970
I'll have him leave tonight.

272
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,536
Good.

273
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,268
Hanji.

274
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,304
Be careful now.

275
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,976
I don't want to go alone!

276
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:47,552
Please come with me!

277
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,678
Stupid!

278
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,547
What happened to your
decision to go straight?

279
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,627
You have to appreciate
your mother and sister.

280
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,265
What about you?

281
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,943
Don't worry about me.

282
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,008
I'm going to Edo.

283
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:22,218
I have to find my mother.

284
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,724
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way.

285
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,502
Chutaro,

286
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,665
do you have traveling funds?

287
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,641
Thank you for worrying about me.

288
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:50,814
I have 100 ryo on me.

289
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,348
Brother...!

290
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,349
How did you get so much money?

291
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:10,291
I saved it for my mother
that I'm going to meet.

292
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,037
Just what I need...

293
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,993
I'm glad you are safe.

294
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:49,863
Will you help me write something?

295
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,399
That's an easy request.

296
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:13,324
One, the person who killed these men is...

297
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,219
...from Sakata, Goshu...

298
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,909
...and his name is Chutaro.

299
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,267
Brother...

300
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,566
Chutaro...

301
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,305
What's wrong?

302
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,712
Go ahead and laugh at me.

303
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,718
I was separated from my
mother at the age of five.

304
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,163
And you made me think of my mother.

305
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:03,265
I feel like a kid, yearning
for his lost mother.

306
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,471
I'm sorry.

307
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:48,011
When I close my eyes
and think about her...

308
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,818
I can picture her, even
if I cant' recall her face.

309
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:07,229
EDO

310
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,898
I feel silly.

311
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,677
Old woman, change the tune.

312
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,049
How silly.

313
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,319
Play something trendy.

314
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,357
That's enough.

315
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,265
That was good.

316
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,560
That was fun.

317
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:31,309
Here you go.

318
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,321
Okay, I'm off.

319
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,448
Excuse me...

320
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,247
What is it?

321
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,028
Are you trying to embarrass me?

322
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,196
Damn you old woman!

323
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,369
What is it?

324
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,670
Aren't you going to pay her?

325
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,796
What?

326
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,931
I'm sorry.

327
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,979
I was going to pay her.

328
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,504
I'm leaving the money here.

329
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,750
If you'll excuse me...

330
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,342
How dare he pick on an old woman.

331
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,954
Thank you.

332
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,184
You needn't thank me so much.

333
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,819
How old?

334
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,133
I'm asking you for your age.

335
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,330
I'm fifty years old.

336
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,002
Do you have any children?

337
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,542
I had one, but I gave him away.

338
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,670
I don't know if he's dead or alive now.

339
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,781
To add to it, my husband passed away.

340
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,912
That is why I'm in this state.

341
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:53,961
I'm barely making a living.

342
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,736
What is the name of the
child you gave away?

343
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:06,205
Do you know Kotaro?!

344
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,578
Is his name Kotaro?

345
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,567
Yes!

346
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,772
Then I must have the wrong person.

347
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,648
Oh, I see.

348
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,414
Were you ever in Goshu
in your younger days?

349
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,387
No. I've been in Edo all my life.

350
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,185
I haven't gone beyond the Kawasaki area.

351
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,032
I see...

352
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,659
Don't be disheartened.

353
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:38,501
I'm sure your son will
come looking for you.

354
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,167
So don't lose hope.

355
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,473
Old woman...

356
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,149
If I see you again, I'll give you more.

357
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,583
But for today, I'll give you this much.

358
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,285
Sir, you gave me 2-shu.

359
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,794
Are you sure I can have all this?

360
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,319
Yes... take it.

361
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,694
Thank you very much.

362
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:43,860
I'll be drawing the lucky number!

363
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,333
What are you doing?

364
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:32,181
Tsuru-1961!

365
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:47,421
The lucky number is Tsuru-1961!

366
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,170
Are you with the Iioka gang?

367
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,180
Are you the boss for Sendai-ya?

368
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,953
Please help us.

369
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,648
Yes, I will do what I can.

370
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:17,388
I don't know these men,
Chutaro and Hanjiro.

371
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,094
Is that so...

372
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:26,597
We heard that Chutaro
was seen here in Edo.

373
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,706
That is why we came here.

374
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,335
If you're so sure...
you don't need my help.

375
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,502
Sukegoro also works as a cop.

376
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:41,045
It might be faster to use his connections.

377
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,757
Are you saying you
won't help Iioka Sukegoro?

378
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,126
I'm not saying that I won't help but...

379
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,425
I'm busy and short-handed myself.

380
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,898
Please leave for today.

381
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,427
Boss!

382
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,950
He's not the only boss in Edo.

383
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,295
There are other
gangs we can go to.

384
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,364
It's only a matter of time
before we find them.

385
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,888
That's right. We'll find them.

386
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:33,193
While our money lasts...

387
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,805
Let's do it ourselves.

388
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,906
That's impossible.

389
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,743
Edo is a big place.
It could take us forever.

390
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:44,443
I'm not going back until I kill those two.

391
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:50,249
Let's pay a boss to help us find them.

392
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,189
Excuse me!

393
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,017
Who are you?

394
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:02,796
I'm Kingoro.
I know every corner in Edo.

395
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,528
What do you want?

396
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:10,536
Edo is not your ordinary place.

397
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,737
Don't waste your money.

398
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,637
What do you want?

399
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:26,179
Why don't you pay me
a gold coin to help you?

400
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,390
You win again.

401
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,961
Ready!

402
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,437
Get ready!

403
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,912
Place your bets!

404
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,111
You're awfully lucky.

405
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,114
Can I come in?

406
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,266
My name is Komata Yosuke.

407
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,058
I'm Banba-no-Chutaro.

408
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,669
Have I met you before?

409
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,984
Sensei!

410
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,464
Oh, it's you, Kingoro.

411
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:54,677
Didn't you sleep with
a cheap woman last night?

412
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,579
So, how was it?

413
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,776
I didn't get much action.

414
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:07,814
She went to the bathroom
and never came back.

415
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,418
What woman wouldn't reject you?

416
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,758
You have an out-of-date look!

417
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,331
You should talk.

418
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:23,866
Did you lose your
money at gambling last night?

419
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,970
I was sliced to pieces by
this guy at the Hosokawa den.

420
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,147
And was mercilessly killed.

421
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,612
Who's the guy who walked away with all?

422
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,858
He's been showing up
there a lot recently...

423
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,418
and his name is Banba-no-Chutaro.

424
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,355
Sensei!

425
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,558
Did you just say Banba-no-Chutaro?

426
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,600
Yes I did. So what?

427
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,462
I'm in luck!

428
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,867
Sensei...

429
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,340
He's going to bring us money.

430
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,444
Hey...

431
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,109
So he goes to the Hosokawa mansion.

432
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:11,149
Let's go back there and
wait for him to show up.

433
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,483
Then we'll capture him.

434
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,558
Then what?

435
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:21,430
We can collect ten gold coins.

436
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,226
Sensei, and you can get half of it.

437
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,235
You've got a deal.

438
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:36,403
We'll need money to
play at the Hosokawa den.

439
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,087
What? Kingoro is here again?

440
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,793
Shall I tell him you are
out and turn him away?

441
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,885
Wait.

442
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,320
There's no end to this.

443
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,828
I'll be firm with him today.

444
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,462
Have him wait.

445
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,402
Show them to the room.

446
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,309
Mom, are you going to be all right?

447
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,443
Shall I go?

448
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:12,814
Don't worry.
I can handle a black-mailer or two.

449
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:18,053
Weren't you going shopping with Chojiro?

450
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,520
The rain has let up.
You should go now.

451
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,056
The gardener will be
bringing the flowers later.

452
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,529
I'm suggesting that the
two of you take a walk.

453
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,194
Mom.

454
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,532
You should let her pamper
you while you can.

455
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,614
Let's go.

456
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,775
Bye for now.

457
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,847
Thank you.

458
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,094
Madam, hello.

459
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,793
You never seem to age.

460
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:10,263
You look ten years
younger than your age.

461
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:15,741
You are truly pretty.

462
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,710
You're not getting a cent out of me today!

463
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,319
Don't be like that.

464
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,618
And don't come here again.

465
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,624
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

466
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,457
Wait a minute.

467
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:42,639
When I was working as a maid before,

468
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,470
you were a local punk.

469
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,545
But I don't remember
ever being friends with you.

470
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,605
Let me set the record straight.

471
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,648
I have influential clients.

472
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,619
Don't take me lightly.

473
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,309
Madam, this will be the last time.

474
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:32,012
I need it as a working capital.

475
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,759
Please give me one gold coin.

476
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,327
The answer is no.

477
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,329
Please help me out here.

478
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,597
Stop being persistent.

479
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,326
Please don't say that.

480
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,125
Get out!

481
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,527
Madam please!

482
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,636
Get your hands off of me!

483
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,072
Stay out of this!

484
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,245
Madam please!

485
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,848
Stop being persistent!

486
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:58,837
Get lost!

487
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,910
Throw him out.

488
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,352
Hands off!

489
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,826
Hey, Ohama...

490
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,939
I'm leaving for today but...

491
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:32,249
I will come to ruin it for
Otose on her wedding day!

492
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,250
Just remember that!

493
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,308
Wait!

494
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,948
What is it?

495
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,288
Excuse me.

496
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,762
Ohama...

497
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,342
Don't let any strange people inside.

498
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,424
Don't make a mistake here.

499
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,086
Get lost.

500
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,863
You're Kingoro.

501
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,234
It's me, Otora.

502
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:29,039
I used to work as a
maid with Ohama before.

503
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,132
Are you still saying that?

504
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,673
You better cut it out before you get hurt!

505
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,977
I will beat her up so that
she doesn't come again.

506
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,317
So, will you think
about that request of mine?

507
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,249
Ouch!

508
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,222
Ohama...

509
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:49,181
I apologize for showing up unexpectedly.

510
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:54,887
I haven't been feeling
well lately, so I can't work.

511
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,501
That is why I swallowed
my pride and came to you.

512
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:01,870
She has no friend that
is a street prostitute!

513
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,439
Get lost, old hag!

514
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,879
Get out!

515
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:19,911
Bastard!

516
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,023
What do you have against me?

517
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:36,196
Don't come into my territory.

518
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,271
You're not getting anything from her!

519
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:45,782
I will tell her you are a
villain trying to suck her dry!

520
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,306
Damn bitch!

521
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,879
Brute!

522
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,578
Damn hag!

523
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,084
Are you this old hag's son?

524
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,848
Why do you pick on the weak?

525
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,021
Shut up!

526
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,688
Do you see this knife?

527
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,374
You'll pay for this!

528
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,009
That's Banba-no-Chutaro!

529
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,480
What?

530
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,661
Sensei, get him!

531
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,788
But...

532
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,857
This isn't a good place to do it.

533
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,261
Well, keep an eye on him.

534
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,173
In the mean time,

535
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,404
I will go and get the
men who are after him.

536
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:26,674
This isn't a show. Go.

537
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,077
Go on.

538
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,978
Are you okay?

539
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:52,072
How old are you?

540
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,106
My age?

541
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,875
Are you going to ask
me for my name next?

542
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:07,388
Wait. Take out your hand.

543
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:17,192
Are you interested?

544
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,058
No, that's not it.

545
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,597
Just answer my questions.

546
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,564
That's your fee for listening.

547
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,401
I see. Ask me anything then.

548
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,414
I'll tell you what I know.

549
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,213
Are you hungry?

550
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,821
If you're going to treat me to something...

551
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,721
Pops, can I get some 'sake'?

552
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,525
Here.

553
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,141
Thanks.

554
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,420
Do you have a grown son?

555
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,819
A son?

556
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,090
Do you have one?

557
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,177
Where is he now?

558
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,576
If he's alive, he'd be 25...

559
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:43,980
But he died.

560
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,384
I'm sorry for asking.

561
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,555
Please forgive me.

562
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,226
Wait.

563
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,729
You're a nice man.

564
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:11,173
Everyone treats me
like trash, but not you.

565
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,848
It's been years since
someone treated me kindly.

566
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,889
Thank you.
I'll never forget your kindness.

567
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,357
Don't tell me that.

568
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,492
You seem to have your circumstances.

569
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,926
Who are you looking for?

570
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,677
I wish I could help you...

571
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,948
Whenever I see a woman passing by...

572
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,939
I think she's my...

573
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,911
I've been searching
for her for a year now.

574
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,853
But unfortunately, I haven't
been able to find her yet.

575
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,123
Who is she?

576
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,423
She's about your age.

577
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,564
Is she your mother?

578
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,570
Perhaps...

579
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:39,901
Ohama used to tell me about
her child she left back at home.

580
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:47,170
But it happened more than 15 years ago.

581
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,002
Where did she leave her child?

582
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:58,188
It was long ago, but...
I think she said it was Goshu.

583
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,280
Goshu?

584
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,917
Like I said, it was very long ago.

585
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,261
Who knows what has become of her child.

586
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:14,800
She probably has forgotten
about him completely.

587
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,838
Mothers aren't like that.

588
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:23,044
Ohama and I used to be very close before.

589
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,841
We were like sisters.

590
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:31,955
But the past few years,
she would ignore me when she

591
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:35,982
sees me, and when I go to her
for help, she'd thrown me out.

592
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:43,327
People change over time.

593
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,201
That may be so, but..

594
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,036
A parent-child relationship is special.

595
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,606
Many years can go by,

596
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:53,337
but it doesn't change the fact
that they are parent and child.

597
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,441
They have the same
blood flowing in them.

598
00:56:55,845 --> 00:57:00,214
Why don't you go see her?

599
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,618
She may not be my mother.

600
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,451
That's true.

601
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,068
I miss my son now.

602
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:27,706
I think I will go to see him.

603
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,610
Are you going to visit his grave?

604
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:48,061
Buy some incense and flowers for him.

605
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,369
This is a gold coin!

606
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,304
It's not stolen money.

607
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,138
As you can see, I'm a yakuza.

608
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,172
It's not money that I worked hard for.

609
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,415
It's just money I won from gambling.

610
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,076
It's easy money.

611
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:14,690
Maybe you can start a peddling business.

612
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,889
That will make your son rest in peace.

613
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:12,197
This is beautiful!

614
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,271
I can picture the Miss
in her wedding kimono.

615
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:19,346
It was an ordeal to raise her this far.

616
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,917
The real challenge comes from now.

617
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:30,624
She will be the wife of Iseya,
a top cotton dealer in Edo.

618
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:37,400
I have to do my best
to keep a good reputation.

619
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,389
Here.

620
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,810
Madam, there's a man
here causing trouble.

621
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,301
What does he want?

622
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:54,879
Go tell them to quiet down.

623
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,119
Who could be causing this ruckus?

624
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:20,000
Madam, I'm sorry about the commotion.

625
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,566
What was it all about?

626
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:27,944
There was a man who
wanted to talk to you.

627
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:32,055
He wanted to talk to me?
All right, I'll talk to him.

628
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,454
I wouldn't advise you to.

629
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:44,294
He was talking to the
street prostitute earlier.

630
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,929
He must be in cahoots
with that prostitute.

631
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,934
I'll be going now.

632
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,576
He sounds persistent.

633
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:58,214
He sure is.
He was humble at first.

634
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,651
Then he showed his
true colors and got stubborn.

635
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,954
Show him in.

636
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,122
Don't meet him.

637
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,419
Just have him come here.

638
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,718
I will scold him and send him away.

639
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,984
Are you sure?

640
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,585
I'll go get him then.

641
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,824
Hey, the madam will meet him!

642
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,092
Are you sure?

643
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,228
I'll hear you out.

644
01:02:55,872 --> 01:03:00,206
But don't drag it out.

645
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,009
Please excuse me.

646
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,950
Aren't you going to say something?

647
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,785
Yes... I will talk.

648
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,354
What is it?

649
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,795
Madam...

650
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,627
Please pardon my
rudeness for asking this.

651
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:06,765
Do you have a son about my age?

652
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,647
You do?

653
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:20,951
Did you leave him in Banba of Goshu?

654
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,953
Did you?

655
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,761
I know Banba very well.

656
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,693
So what of it?

657
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:35,194
Do you know of an inn
run by Okinagaya Chubei?

658
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,436
Yes, I do.

659
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,208
I used to live there in my younger days.

660
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:41,801
Mom!

661
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,276
What's with you?

662
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,606
Don't get strange on me!

663
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,113
Please forgive my rudeness.

664
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,350
Who are you?

665
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,919
I'm Chutaro.

666
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,418
What? You're Chutaro?

667
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,685
Yes!

668
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:07,328
I had a son named Chutaro,
but he passed away.

669
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,270
No, that can't be true.

670
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,635
It's been 20 years since
we were separated.

671
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:18,305
You lost touch with me,
so you thought I was dead.

672
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,684
Our bonds may be severed,
but we are still related by blood.

673
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:24,448
We are mother and son,
no matter what happens.

674
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,317
I'm Chutaro from Banba!

675
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,051
Wait a minute.

676
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:34,764
You seem awfully
knowledgeable of Banba,

677
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,130
but that doesn't mean anything to me.

678
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:46,976
True, I got married to
Okinagaya in Banba,

679
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,544
and had a son named Chutaro.

680
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,679
I'm that Chutaro!

681
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:50,839
Will you listen to the end?

682
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:57,013
I left Okinaga-ya when
he was five years old.

683
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:02,881
Yes, I know...

684
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:08,060
When you left, Dad had bad morals.

685
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:12,928
When I grew up, I was
told he was at fault.

686
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:20,731
I didn't want to leave
my child and divorce him.

687
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,808
For a long time after that...

688
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:35,424
I would live in tears, looking
at the skies toward Goshu.

689
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,961
I'm so glad to have found you.

690
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:48,092
I would try my best to
remember your face...

691
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,273
but I just couldn't remember it.

692
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:59,111
I was mortified for being born stupid.

693
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:05,388
Twenty years have gone by,
trying to find you without a clue.

694
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,548
Enough!

695
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,653
You are not my son,
Chutaro, who I gave birth to.

696
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,163
Then who am I?

697
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,222
Stay away from me!

698
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,767
I heard Chutaro died from
an epidemic when he was nine.

699
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,899
I remember almost dying
when I was nine years old.

700
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,844
But I didn't die!

701
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,379
I am alive right here!

702
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,847
I wouldn't mistake my child!

703
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,643
Leave!

704
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,841
You can't worm yourself in!

705
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:47,359
Do you think I'm here for the money?

706
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,331
Why else would you be here?

707
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,992
You got it all wrong!

708
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,793
I didn't come here to
get money from you!

709
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:59,003
I'm not in need of money.

710
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:12,378
I thought if I should meet
my mother by fate, then...

711
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,521
I would give her this money,
if she was living in poverty.

712
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:25,128
I had saved a 100 gold
coins to give to her.

713
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,700
You seem to be living in a grand house...

714
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,368
...with many employees.

715
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:46,477
You are suspicious of people
because you have wealth.

716
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:51,292
You'd even suspect your very own son.

717
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,564
How I resent that...

718
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,498
I should be the one to resent it.

719
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:01,601
I was having a great
life with my daughter.

720
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,573
Then you pop up saying
you are my son, Chutaro.

721
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,575
Did you come to create waves?

722
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,410
What an awful thing to say, Mom!
- Are you still calling me Mom?!

723
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,578
Because you are my Mom!

724
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,875
I know what you're up to!

725
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,783
You want half my daughter's inheritance.

726
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:23,115
I've seen the good and bad side of life.

727
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,359
I can figure out that much.

728
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,604
What an awful thing to say...

729
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:21,576
Madam, let me ask you again.

730
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:26,015
Is Chutaro from Banba, not your son?

731
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,587
Are you saying that I'm not your son?

732
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:33,660
Yes, that's right.

733
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:39,899
I had a son, but I heard
that he passed away.

734
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,471
That's what I believed all these years.

735
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:49,645
Even if he were to come
and see me, alive...

736
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,044
I can't feel happy about it.

737
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:59,652
I didn't think that the many years apart...

738
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,723
could create such a big gap in our hearts.

739
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:11,130
They say the child doesn't
understand his parent's feelings.

740
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,830
But in my case, it's just the opposite.

741
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:26,446
You have no idea how
much I care about you.

742
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,447
Chutaro...

743
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,646
What is it?

744
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:38,186
If I said I am your mother...

745
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,118
What did you want from me?

746
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:42,391
Why do you want to know?

747
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:50,765
I know that you enjoy
your peaceful life now.

748
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,699
And you don't want me
to spoil that for you.

749
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:59,670
There's no mother who
doesn't love her child.

750
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,349
But that depends on the child, too.

751
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,488
Chutaro...

752
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:10,426
If you were searching for your mother...

753
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,257
Why didn't you remain straight?

754
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,988
Madam, don't tell me what to do.

755
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:25,065
How can you expect a parentless
child to not go astray in life?

756
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:31,236
Say I had remained straight...

757
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,307
There wouldn't be anyone
who would be happy for me.

758
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,545
I was all alone, without anything.

759
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:53,694
I'm going to hit the road again.

760
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,194
Hey you!

761
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,465
This isn't a story for you to listen to!

762
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,076
Madam...

763
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,879
I won't come here again.

764
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,854
Didn't you say you have a daughter?

765
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:19,489
I wish I could have met her.

766
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,529
I'm such a fool.

767
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:29,629
When I'd close my eyes tightly...

768
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:36,638
I'd picture the mother I
had parted with as a child.

769
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,742
But I had to come here and
ruin what little memory I had.

770
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,364
Welcome home.

771
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:48,508
Mom, who is that man?

772
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:51,876
Who is he?

773
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,050
There was a resemblance...

774
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:00,291
Isn't he your older brother from Goshu?

775
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,323
Mom, is that right?

776
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:13,171
Mom, that was my brother, wasn't it?

777
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,501
That was my brother!

778
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:23,415
Why did you send him away?

779
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:31,184
I adore you most since you
have been with me all along.

780
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:36,655
When Chutaro showed
up out of the blue...

781
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,227
I was wary of him as an imposter.

782
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,232
Midway...

783
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:50,902
I thought he had come
to get an inheritance.

784
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:59,847
In the end, I thought he
would ruin things for you.

785
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:03,514
How can you say that!

786
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:08,487
He is your child, too!

787
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,179
Otose, Choji...

788
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:30,277
Please find Chutaro and
bring him back here!

789
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:34,713
Hurry! Please find him!

790
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:58,603
Who's there?

791
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,851
I recognize your faces.

792
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:13,524
What do you want with me?

793
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,930
We're taking your life.

794
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:21,167
You should stay out of my way tonight.

795
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,596
Oh really?

796
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,674
Look there.

797
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,789
Do you have parents?

798
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:51,688
What? Parents? No!

799
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,836
Do you have children?

800
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,894
No!

801
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,896
So you have none...

802
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,134
Bastards!

803
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,194
Chutaro!

804
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,632
Brother!

805
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,838
Brother!

806
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,263
Brother!

807
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,673
We have lost track of him.

808
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,437
Maybe we should check
the next village, too.

809
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:52,009
Is this what it means to have no fate?

810
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,014
Mom...

811
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,687
I was wrong...

812
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,854
I was wrong.

813
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:12,367
I can sense him nearby...

814
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,207
Brother!

815
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,943
Chutaro! Brother!

816
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,263
Brother!

817
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,034
Brother!

818
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:52,277
Brother!

819
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,809
Chutaro!

820
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,754
Chutaro!

821
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,559
Dear sister...

822
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,798
Chutaro!

823
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:06,440
