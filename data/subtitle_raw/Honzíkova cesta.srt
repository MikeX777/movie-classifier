1
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,559
Qui-et, child-ren, we be-gin.

2
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:47,240
This is Gonzik, and this is a train.

3
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:56,796
The train is moving.
Gonzik is waving.

4
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,516
The movie is called...

5
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:09,258
...The Journey of Gonzik

6
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,007
One more time.

7
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,401
Quiet, children, we begin.

8
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,803
This is Gonzik.

9
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,323
And this is the train.

10
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,846
The train is moving.

11
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,762
Gonzik is waving.

12
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,763
Come on, children.

13
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,007
Gonzik!

14
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,522
Gonzik, don't be afraid.

15
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,419
What?

16
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,818
Let me ride.

17
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,046
I'm here. Leave me!

18
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,243
Why are you shoving?
Quit!

19
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,204
Gonzik. Gonzik!

20
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,206
Gonzik, come here.

21
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,121
Imagine, someone wrote to you.

22
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,048
To me?

23
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,958
It says here, "Jan Tichy, a
pupil in Prague Kindergarten".

24
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,486
Is it you or not?

25
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,421
Yes.

26
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,248
Here you are.

27
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,368
Gonzik.

28
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,840
It's a letter, see.

29
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,546
I know...

30
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,060
...but what's in it?

31
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,724
Well...

32
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,686
...he wrote to me.

33
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,727
Somebody.

34
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,085
Can you read?

35
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,884
Big deal!
Easy!

36
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,834
Look!

37
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:20,996
That's an "O"...

38
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,920
...and here's also "O".

39
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,374
- And so...
- And so you're a fool.

40
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,003
Madam teacher!

41
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,201
Madam teacher!

42
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,043
Guys, follow me.

43
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,646
Sir, can we ask you...

44
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,285
A quarter to ten.
Exactly. Cheers!

45
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,236
What are you staring at?

46
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,048
Go play!

47
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,359
Well?

48
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,644
We have a letter.
Please read it to us.

49
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,005
Well, show me.

50
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,004
"Dear Gonzik,...

51
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,723
...The plums in the garden are already
soft, and the apples have all fallen.

52
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,285
Grandad. This is written by
my grandad.

53
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,929
Puntya runs around the village
sniffing at the boys.

54
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,442
He can't find you.

55
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,918
The cat sits on the gatepost,
waiting for you to come."

56
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,249
Here it's smudged,
so I can't read it.

57
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,005
"You must come."

58
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,848
Okay!

59
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,886
Now let me work.

60
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,085
How far is it?

61
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,608
Thither?

62
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,284
- Very!
- And will you go?

63
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,303
Alone?

64
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,406
I am not afraid...I'll go.

65
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,725
Yes, yes, yes, braggart.

66
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,806
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

67
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,322
The flower by the brook...

68
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,123
...is called primrose.

69
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,003
He on whom this word falls...

70
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,440
...must be up and away.

71
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,007
Mum! Mum!

72
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,969
Gonzik.

73
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,765
Plums in the garden are soft,
and the apples have fallen.

74
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,205
A cat runs around the village.

75
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,845
I have no time for your
silliness, Gonzik.

76
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,325
Go home and play.

77
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,327
Here, take this.

78
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,160
Gonzik, what are you doing?
I wish you'd be happy...

79
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,488
...without making a mess.
Just look at it!

80
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:47,324
Gather everything together,
and don't start with something else!

81
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,524
- Mum, I'm going out.
- Out of the question!

82
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,326
I'll do it myself.

83
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,766
I was going to.

84
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,240
You heard me!

85
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,966
Are you going to do it?

86
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,323
I'm not staying here anyway.

87
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,202
Really?

88
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,480
I'll go away.

89
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:39,319
I'll take the marble...

90
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,040
...and stick, and I'll go.

91
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,162
And that's it!

92
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,159
Don't be in a hurry to leave me.

93
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,925
Do you think someone will want you?

94
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,418
Such a messy boy?

95
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,086
Look, it's mine.

96
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,243
You see, my grandad
wrote to me.

97
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,886
Grandad doesn't understand.

98
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,559
Dad only comes home from work
on Sundays, and I have a job.

99
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,780
Who will go with you?

100
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,045
I'll go myself, Mum.

101
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,410
I'm big enough and not afraid.

102
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,698
Don't even think it!

103
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:33,163
Mum, Mum, I'll be obedient.

104
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,446
I'll tidy up.

105
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,124
You may have the marble.

106
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,407
Okay?

107
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,285
But it's impossible, Gonzik.

108
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,962
You're not going anywhere.
What would Dad say?

109
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,565
- Come on, Gonzik, come.
- I know, Mom.

110
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,808
I won't leave the coach
until they tell me to.

111
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,046
Come, Gonzik, come.

112
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:43,560
I won't stick my head
out the window.

113
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,523
You see, I know.
Right, Mum?

114
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,246
- The train's leaving, we must run.
- Wait wait.

115
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,806
Now, it'll be easier.

116
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,887
Just don't push ahead
of the others.

117
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,765
Gonzik, please stay here,
and don't go out, okay?

118
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,842
Here's your suitcase. Grandad
will be waiting for you.

119
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,165
Mum, go now.

120
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,568
I can manage.
Nothing will go wrong.

121
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,866
Say hello to them.

122
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,723
- Here.
- What is it, Mum?

123
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,684
Something for your journey.

124
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,928
Mum, dear!

125
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,446
So, you're Gonzik?

126
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,967
Do you want something?

127
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,846
I want to pee.

128
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,006
Come with me.

129
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,886
Well, young man?

130
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,086
Oh no. Are you really crying?

131
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,766
I'm not crying.

132
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,442
I just spilled my candy.

133
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,446
- Where are you headed?
- To my Grandad.

134
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,608
And you're going alone?

135
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,524
Grandad will meet me.

136
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,323
I'm also going to Grandma.

137
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,042
Here, help yourself.

138
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,806
Thank you.

139
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,765
Very good candy.

140
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,132
What's your name?

141
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,897
I have two names.

142
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,210
You don't say!

143
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,490
It's true!

144
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,908
Mum calls me Gonzik...

145
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:05,827
...and at school the teacher calls me
Jan Tichy.

146
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,015
That's also me!

147
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,205
So you go to school?

148
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,402
Uh-huh. I do!

149
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,067
I walk with the other guys to school...

150
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:20,027
...and then we eat breakfast.

151
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,168
Aha. I see.

152
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,641
And where are you going?

153
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:26,828
To work.

154
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:29,114
I work here...on the road, you know?

155
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,766
Safe journey, Gonzik.

156
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,140
It's time for me to get off.

157
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:35,950
I must go further.

158
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,403
Thank you for the candy.
Say hello to your grandad!

159
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:07,720
Further, further, further, further,
soon there, soon there.

160
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,047
Choo, choo, choo, choo,
the train chugs along.

161
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,115
The cart is waiting,
Grandad's waiting...

162
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,043
Puntya's waiting,
The cat's waiting.

163
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:33,288
Grandad's waiting, he has a whip.
That's why I'm not scared!

164
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,604
If somebody comes, Grandad
will whip, and Puntya will bite.

165
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,487
Ticket inspection!

166
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,286
Your ticket.

167
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,218
Ticket.

168
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,204
Thank you, but I'm on duty.
I can't accept.

169
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,892
So then?

170
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:07,003
It's like...,
I, please...Mummy...

171
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,438
Are you the boy who's going to
visit his grandad?

172
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,866
Yes.

173
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,003
- Who will be met by his grandad?
- I am.

174
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,319
Why didn't you tell me you're
all by yourself, Gonzik?

175
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,689
I thought I'd have to
put you off at the next station.

176
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,884
Why?

177
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,683
It's what happens when someone
doesn't have a ticket, you know?

178
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,839
But you won't put me off, will you?
You see...

179
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,279
...I'm going to see my grandad.

180
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,203
Well, we'll see.

181
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:42,729
Here you go.

182
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,846
Come on, Gonzik.

183
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,960
So look after yourself.

184
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,446
Bye.

185
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,566
You'll find Grandad there.

186
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,766
Grandad, Grandad!

187
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,644
Wait a minute!
Easy, Mindo! Whoa!

188
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:43,282
Let's have a look at you, traveler.

189
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,286
Did you forget anything?

190
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,286
My suitcase. Grandad, my suitcase.

191
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,923
- Grandad?
- What is it, Gonzik?

192
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,485
Whose horse is this?

193
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,764
I know Puntya, I know the cat, but
I've never seen the horse.

194
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,920
The horse belongs to the cooperative,
you know.

195
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,163
Grandad, what's the cooperative?

196
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,441
The horse belongs to the whole village.
I borrowed it for today.

197
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,817
- And grandad...
- What?

198
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,333
What else does cooperative mean?

199
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,965
For instance, the field. You see?

200
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,358
All these are our fields.

201
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,925
And we also have pigs.

202
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,526
They are my responsibility.

203
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,483
And as to the hens,
Grandma is responsible.

204
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,402
Grandad...and Puntya,
is Puntya the cooperative's?

205
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,882
No, Puntya is not the cooperative's.
He's only ours.

206
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,409
Grandma...granny!

207
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:36,281
So where's the fire?

208
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,284
Just see what I brought!

209
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,860
Gonzik come to me.
Show me if you can jump.

210
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:49,548
Well, of course you can!

211
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,640
You wouldn't be hungry, would you?

212
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,563
I'll make something for you, come.

213
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,727
- Grandad, the suitcase!
- Here you are.

214
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,728
You carry it yourself?
So go and eat.

215
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,487
Look, Grandma, I have a suitcase.

216
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,495
You have a nice suitcase.

217
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,268
You must have brought me something.

218
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,999
- Here, keep the marble, Grandma.
- Marble?

219
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,483
- A marble, what should I do with it?
- You play with it.

220
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,688
I better put it away, so I don't lose it.

221
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,484
Eat quickly, and let's go to the garden.
The plums are like honey.

222
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,045
Let's see, you'll be more comfortable.

223
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,088
I'll put it here.

224
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,992
- Now give me your shirt.
- I can do it myself.

225
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:18,781
Sure, you can. Like that.

226
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,522
Put it on.

227
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,967
Puntya, wait.
Don't swallow it.

228
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,323
You forgot to spit out the stone.

229
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,046
Look.

230
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,405
Did you see?

231
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,290
By the way, I've come.

232
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,885
The other boys will tease you.

233
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,406
Are you afraid to play
with a stranger?

234
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,798
Puntya, do you want a plum?

235
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,009
I'll pick as many as you want.

236
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,926
I can.

237
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,880
We'll eat them all up.

238
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,206
What are you thinking?
There's nothing to worry about.

239
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,846
Catch me.

240
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,242
Puntya.

241
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,923
Punyta, over here!

242
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,488
Puntya.

243
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,480
Come down here!

244
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,806
Hang on! I'll be there!.
You'll see!

245
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,364
You'll be there till tonight.

246
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,407
- Ferdo, come on!
- See you later!

247
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,365
Grandad!

248
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,565
Grandma!

249
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,322
Hey.

250
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,560
What are you doing there?

251
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,646
I climbed up to pick Grandad's plums.

252
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,849
- You want one?
- Throw me one.

253
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,723
Come here so you won't miss it.

254
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,560
There is a hole in the fence.

255
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,639
You were here last year.

256
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,685
You're Gonzik, right?

257
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,280
Theresa.

258
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,845
It's sweet.

259
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,806
Let's go.

260
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,605
Hey.
Hey.

261
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,439
This is Gonzik.
He's from Prague.

262
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,646
And this is Victor.

263
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,358
Do you want a baked apple?

264
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,560
Gonzik's a dick.

265
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,807
You know what my name is?

266
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:15,803
There are boys in my street...
Franchik...and Pepi.

267
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,008
We have a park to play in.

268
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,644
Do you play with kites?

269
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,687
Where can they fly a kite?
There are only houses and no sky!

270
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,842
- The sky is everywhere.
- True!

271
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,685
Well then, look.

272
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:51,004
Oh! Look, it's smiling-the kite!

273
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,640
It doesn't smile. It frowns.

274
00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:00,367
Not true, I know it. Up there,
it smiles, and down here it frowns.

275
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,846
- Here you see!
- Gonzik, take this.

276
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,924
Hold tight.
Don't let go of the string!

277
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,043
Look at it now.

278
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,126
Give it to me!

279
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,566
I'm not giving it.

280
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,244
Victor can't see us.

281
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,085
Gonzik must obey Victor,
and, anyway, he gave it to him.

282
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,966
Listen, if you don't give
it to me, I'll hit you!

283
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,321
Just you try!

284
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,203
I'll make a hamburger out of you!
I warn you!

285
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,520
Calm down!

286
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,247
Gonzik and Theresa are lovers.

287
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,448
Ha-haa!

288
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,489
Gonzik's dick's a drummer's stick...

289
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,164
...for drumming poor Theresa.

290
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,009
Theresa ups and yanks his stick...

291
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,281
...so Gonzik can't get off her. Ha ha ha!

292
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,645
Oh, Grandma, let me go, oh.
Oh, Grandma...

293
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,168
We need to wash away all the dirt.
You're like a chimneysweep.

294
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,441
Hush! Almost already. Now.

295
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,959
Well, I don't recognize you.
Grandad, your shirt!

296
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,240
My boy, I'll give it to you.

297
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,960
So, let's go.

298
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,002
Eh, but isn't he heavy?

299
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,487
Hold him carefully.
Don't drop him.

300
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,607
Will I sleep here alone?

301
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,087
If you're afraid, I'll sleep with you.
But you mustn't kick.

302
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,600
Yes, yes, yes, I will.
So I'll sleep here alone.

303
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,880
Well what do you know?

304
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,882
What a boy.

305
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,449
But Puntya can sleep with me.

306
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,529
Not Puntya.
Puntya's guarding outside.

307
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,166
Well, then, the cat.

308
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,248
I'll sleep with the cat.

309
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,170
The cat sleeps in its basket.

310
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,478
You can't even see him at night.
He's blacker than night.

311
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,400
You know what, Grandma?

312
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:18,158
You can lend me the
marble. It glows in the dark.

313
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,457
You can keep it for yourself.
I don't have time to play with it.

314
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,369
You probably don't know how to play
with it either.

315
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,685
Good night.

316
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,242
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

317
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,687
Nice kitty, don't run.

318
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,759
Be nice, kitty, don't run.

319
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,166
Puntya!

320
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,603
Punt, hush! Shhh!

321
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,488
Puntya! Kitty!

322
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,527
Hush! Shhh!

323
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,128
How did you get in here, rascal!
Get out! Out!

324
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,920
Hush, you'll wake Gonzika.

325
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,599
It's better to light the lamp
so he won't be afraid.

326
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:08,436
It seems to me he's a foolhardy chap.

327
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,199
Look, he's sleeping like a log.

328
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,206
Scat! Go away!

329
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,966
What do you want?

330
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,726
Here you go.

331
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,243
Grandad! Grandad!

332
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,321
Grandad, is this a bad goat?

333
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,080
Did she frighten you?

334
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,484
Did she try to butt you?

335
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,044
Yes, but I didn't let her.

336
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,209
Really? You should offer her
a sprig of acacia...

337
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,561
...and she'll follow you like a sheep.

338
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,080
Look. Now goat, now goat.

339
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:02,362
Now, you see?

340
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,525
So, come.

341
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,644
Yes, they're real elephants!

342
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:56,281
You know, Grandad, when I grow up,
I'll also have such pigs.

343
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,288
I'll take one home and
make him a bed in the kitchen.

344
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,368
This one!

345
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,200
Now look what you've done!

346
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,360
Fine helper!

347
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,130
Stay here and don't move.

348
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,408
Puntya!

349
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,169
Gonzik!

350
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,246
Puntya! Away!

351
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:49,092
Go away!

352
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,240
Grandma, let him.

353
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,804
We came to help, see?

354
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:56,524
As though I needed any help!

355
00:42:56,868 --> 00:42:59,391
Now that I think of it,
you can go fetch our lunch.

356
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:03,079
Oh, Puntya, away!
Wait, till I catch you...

357
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,003
Good afternoon.

358
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,610
You're Gonzik Tichy, right?

359
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,483
What's the old man doing?

360
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,566
- Grandad's feeding.
- Feeding?

361
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,287
Kid, today it's pancakes.

362
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,119
Yes.

363
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,808
Do you like pancakes?

364
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,490
- Yes.
- Me too.

365
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,764
They make very good pancakes here.
Very good!

366
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,086
Three meals today.

367
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,519
You're a Tichy, right?

368
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,569
What's your grandad doing?

369
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,649
Grandad is feeding, and Grandma too.

370
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,519
- And are you helping too?
- Yes.

371
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:10,407
Yes? Then you need a snack.
Do you like pancakes?

372
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,249
- Yes.
- Yes? Well, take that.

373
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,327
Thank you.

374
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,050
So. Be careful.

375
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:26,642
Don't drop it.

376
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:28,087
Wait a bit, I'll help you.

377
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:30,275
Some pancakes, yes please.

378
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,442
That's a fine boy!

379
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,688
Who's the boy?

380
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,359
- Are you Gonzik? - Yes.
- Tichy? - Yes.

381
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,801
Grandad's feeding, Grandma too,
and I'm fetching the pancakes.

382
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,728
Bye.

383
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,168
- Come play.
- I'm delivering pancakes.

384
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,839
Imagine! I wouldn't want to
stop the pancake delivery.

385
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,963
- And who are you playing with?
- With you.

386
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,449
How so?

387
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:26,920
What do you see? Look.
I threw, now it's your throw.

388
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,644
It's not true.
I don't play like that.

389
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,604
- No, you play...like a girl.
- Not like a girl!

390
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,568
Then show how.

391
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,362
Look.

392
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,601
It happened by chance!

393
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,686
Wait, I'll show you.

394
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,362
You see?

395
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,002
Look.

396
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,242
What about it?

397
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,367
I'll give you the knife, and
you give me the marble.

398
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,328
Ferdo!

399
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,478
Theresa!

400
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,842
Theresa!

401
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,282
You were unlucky!

402
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,846
First you lost the marble, and now...

403
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,168
What marble?

404
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,256
The one that Ferdo won.

405
00:49:39,272 --> 00:49:42,373
I won. He grabbed it from me
and ran away.

406
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,482
I'll get it back.

407
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,849
Wait, I'll tell Victor.
Come on.

408
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,766
Have we a new gardener?

409
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,240
Thanks for your help,
but it's enough.

410
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,930
- Did you come to watch?
- I...

411
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:11,044
It's Gonzik Tichy.
He came from Prague to his grandad.

412
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,922
Aha! So, that's who you are...

413
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:18,363
...well, how's that, it's
Gonzik Tichy, the bright pupil.

414
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,804
What about your dad?
Has he no time to visit us?

415
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,000
I came alone.

416
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:31,286
Alone? I have to reward your
arrival with a fine tomato.

417
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,841
Did you know that your dad and I
were great buddies?

418
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,690
In the past, however. Things change.

419
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,845
Listen to me, Gonzik, may I show
you our school?

420
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,646
I'll show you where
your dad sat.

421
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,042
Well, let's go.

422
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,127
Look, this year we planted tomatoes here.

423
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,442
That's good, huh?

424
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,585
Gonzik...take this.

425
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:15,726
Thank you.

426
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,159
- You won't forget about visiting
the school? - No.

427
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,643
- Definitely not?
- No.

428
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:21,726
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

429
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:28,808
Did you hear? I may visit the school.
School! School!

430
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,569
Theresa, what do you do in school?

431
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,927
Learn. We learn everything.

432
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,761
Such as?

433
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,085
Reading, and such like.

434
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,442
Today we learned about dogs.

435
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,969
There's nothing to learn about a dog.
It's just a dog.

436
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,565
Well, yes, so what?

437
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,362
What did you learn? A dog is a dog.

438
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:40,844
A dog is a person's best friend.

439
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,802
That's how it is!

440
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,726
Is this a school?

441
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,806
That's huge.

442
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,447
Look, see here...and there, look.
You see?

443
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,722
This way.

444
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,006
This is our classroom.

445
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,362
Look.

446
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,926
This is my seat.

447
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,606
You see, the board.

448
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,808
And there, look at the dog.

449
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,004
- It's just painted.
- How do you like it?

450
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,487
After all, it's not real.
I have a real dog...

451
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,289
...and a cat, and I don't
go to school.

452
00:54:24,588 --> 00:54:26,883
We have only a small school.

453
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,198
One day I'll go to a big one.

454
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:37,680
Aha. The dog is a person's
best friend...

455
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:40,246
...and what about the cat, Theresa?

456
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:44,682
We haven't learned that yet.
That will be tomorrow.

457
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:22,277
They...have...an...aun...tie...
and...an...un...cle...

458
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:24,549
Louder, children.

459
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:28,509
...and...a...mam...ma...and...

460
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,646
Sit up straight.

461
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,584
...a...pap...pa...and...a...bro...ther...

462
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,566
Silence, silence children.

463
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,285
Haven't you ever
seen a living cat?

464
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,123
Well?

465
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:58,007
I thought, since you only have it
in a picture, I'll bring a real one.

466
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,969
That's very kind, Gonzik.

467
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,966
Thank you very much.

468
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,469
Well, take a seat.

469
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,686
No, no, wait, I actually
promised you something, right?

470
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,568
Gonzik Tichy, where?

471
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,005
Ah, yes, there. Come on.

472
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,127
Ferdo, move a little.

473
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:29,086
Gonzik...your father sat
here when I taught him.

474
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,600
Give me your cat.

475
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:39,883
Well, if you want, I'll
tell you about cats.

476
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,240
Children!

477
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:51,819
Do you know what cats can do?

478
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:56,846
They can catch mice.

479
00:56:57,822 --> 00:56:58,929
Right.

480
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:06,001
They can catch mice. They can
pull their claws deep into their paws.

481
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,722
Can you tell us why?

482
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:14,484
- So what won't hear...
- So the mouse won't hear!

483
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:21,006
And when does the cat put its claws out?

484
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,084
Who knows?

485
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,768
It's for you.

486
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:28,246
When he climbs a tree...

487
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,847
...and when boys pull her by the tail.

488
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,685
Gonzik, how many legs does your cat have?

489
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,803
Five.

490
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,602
Five.

491
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:53,085
What, Gonzik, five legs?
Tell, five?

492
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,170
Gonzik counted the tail too.

493
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,599
Well. Think, think, Gonzik?

494
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,286
My cat...he can't find his way home.

495
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,439
Go after him.

496
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:12,080
Well, then, run.

497
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,927
Please, let me go with him...
so he won't get lost.

498
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,200
Good. Okay, off you go.

499
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:21,682
Come on, Gonzik.

500
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,445
Run along. Go on!

501
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,600
So children, let's read on.

502
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,806
Turn over the page.

503
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,126
All done?

504
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:47,962
- Read!
- He's small and he's flying...

505
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:07,880
I'll give you the marble!

506
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,926
Theresa's a baby!

507
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:31,922
I'll show you who's a baby!
I'll give you five legs!

508
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,841
Wait, I'll tell you something.

509
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,562
What then?

510
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,404
We must look for your cat in the woods.

511
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,600
Do you think he's there?

512
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,810
Cats like to walk in the woods.

513
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,166
Well, let's go.

514
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,740
Will we still fight?

515
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,442
I won't, if you won't.

516
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,526
Well then, let's go.

517
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,486
You can't catch me.

518
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,722
- Cat! - Kitty! Kitty! - Cat!

519
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,562
Look.

520
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:00,202
Gonzik, he's there!
Quick, climb up!

521
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:34,918
Ferdo! Ferdo!

522
01:01:47,879 --> 01:01:51,046
Ferdo! Where are you?

523
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,880
Ferdo! Don't hide, come out!

524
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,842
Come!

525
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,523
Ferdo, come!

526
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,800
I'm your friend!

527
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,352
Ferdo!

528
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,522
Ferdo, come out.

529
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,569
What do you want?

530
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,923
You forgot your school bag, see?

531
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,522
Give it here!

532
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,848
- Where's Gonzik?
- How should I know?

533
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:30,527
You should know, since
you're always with him.

534
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,485
Just tell me where you left him.

535
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:38,289
If not...I'll empty your school bag.

536
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,966
In the woods, okay?

537
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,003
He was chasing a squirrel
and didn't want to go home.

538
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:50,726
Victor! Victor!

539
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,802
What have you been up to?
You'll get it...

540
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,849
Gonzik! Gonzik!

541
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:40,048
Take a look.

542
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,764
Gonzik, wake up.

543
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,321
I've been looking everywhere
for Ferdo.

544
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:05,402
Where's Ferdo? He's
wandering somewhere.

545
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:09,962
He's been fooling you.
He's been home a long time.

546
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,286
He wanted you to get scared.

547
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,360
So,so.
He'll get it!

548
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:50,603
Shoo! Shoo!

549
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,484
Well, what is it? Get moving!

550
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,288
Chase her away!

551
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,447
Go away!

552
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,643
A goat must be grabbed
by the horns and dragged.

553
01:06:14,956 --> 01:06:16,289
Out of the way, now.

554
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:29,889
- Come on, goat. Here, little one.
- A little one, is it?

555
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:43,083
Gonzik, comrade,
you know how to do it.

556
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,494
How did you do it?

557
01:06:49,393 --> 01:06:50,393
Gonzik!

558
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:53,448
Gonzik, I caught your cat.

559
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:56,289
Come on, Gonzik.

560
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,844
Come to the stream after dinner.

561
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,680
- I'll teach you how to fish.
- We make sand ovens...

562
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,961
...and cook them.
Come play with us.

563
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,445
And in winter we skate.

564
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,443
- Mum!
- Gonzik!

565
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:48,199
Ferdo! I saw you, Ferdo.
Come out!

566
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,408
Sissy!

567
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,084
You'll go with Gonzik to Prague.

568
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,087
A kiss.

569
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,648
Theresa!

570
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:24,039
Gonzik, will you come back?

571
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,406
I'll come. Right, Mum?

572
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,314
Of course.

573
01:08:30,345 --> 01:08:32,626
Grandad can't manage
everything alone.

574
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,368
He needs your help.

575
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,845
- Well, let's go.
- Ferdo!

576
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:47,566
Ferdo, don't worry. The cat's
already at home.

577
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,161
I know.

578
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:58,679
- For you.
- Ferdo, keep the knife.

579
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:01,199
I've been given so much.

580
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:08,599
Take it! Ferdo gives it to
you with all his heart.

581
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,854
- See you later.
- Come back soon.

582
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,400
Ferdo! Ferdo, take it.

583
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,166
Good-bye, kids!

584
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
