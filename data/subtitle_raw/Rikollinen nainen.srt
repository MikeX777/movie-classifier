00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,007
Tulio presents

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,247
A Woman of Crime

3
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,286
We got rid of
that uptight type again

4
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,642
What does it matter?

5
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,888
He is rather pleasant...
and earnest

6
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,844
Eeva, you must not tease

7
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,044
Talking about being earnest,
it's me who is really serious

8
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,244
You should know that and...

9
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,365
Look at that and think

10
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,841
You really must decide
which one of us, -

11
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,006
or we think that you've
been playing with us -

12
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,645
all these years

13
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,684
But consider that you
will never get rid of me

14
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,884
My good doctor,
you will soon... discover

15
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,050
I solemnly promise to let
you know in the near future -

16
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,245
and inform you of
the feelings of my heart

17
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,170
All right, I've been cheated
again. - Are you sure of that?

18
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,046
No. I am not sure about
anything concerning you

19
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,643
That's why
I hurried over to see, -

20
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,127
that you get safely home

21
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,167
Otherwise I have no idea, -

22
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,245
whether you like
me better than Kristian

23
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,608
But I do know

24
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,322
This is the most important
question of my life. Answer

25
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes, your honour,
I will give you my answer

26
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,445
It is something you
have to find out yourself

27
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,842
Eeva...

28
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,081
Bye, bye.
See you tomorrow

29
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,405
What are you doing here?

30
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,841
Weren't were to meet
in the seaside café?

31
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,963
I'm terribly late. Come on...

32
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,891
No, no. I have no
intention of going there

33
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,970
I am, you see, in the mood
for discovering things

34
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,408
And this time
I will show the direction

35
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,410
(lyyristéi musiikkia viululla)

36
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,284
Eeva... Eeva... Why
didn't I steal you earlier?

37
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,604
That's what I've been
wondering. - You witch

38
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,723
Now you are
mistaken if you think, -

39
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,968
that I will one day let you go

40
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,442
I wonder what Kris
will be saying now?

41
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,327
I'll call him and tell

42
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,811
Kristian... Doctor

43
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,841
We had recently
a serious discussion -

44
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,202
about my heart and so on

45
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,289
I promised
to let you know at once -

46
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,290
if some worrying
symptoms appear

47
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,042
Now I should announce
the big news

48
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,928
Are you coming this afternoon?
- I'll fly, whizz and whirl over there

49
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,489
Don't say anything more

50
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,242
This stupid gadget...
- Hey, listen, Kris. Kris!

51
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,802
These things are
discussed face to face

52
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,407
Take good care
of yourself until then

53
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,331
I have a hundred things
to do before that

54
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,962
Let me just say...
Hello... Hello

55
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,167
Mummy, the person I have
wanted to tell you about, -

56
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,170
but about whom I wasn't
sure, I can tell now

57
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,203
I must appeal
to your good heart

58
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,368
I need a lot of money

59
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,562
You guessed anyway

60
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,484
Thank you for the flowers

61
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,121
Come in, the others are waiting

62
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,526
A toast to the engaged
couple and congratulations

63
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,682
Psst...

64
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,764
Kris dear

65
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,243
Mauri's flower is here.
Would you take it to him?

66
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,291
I'm not meant to see
him before the wedding

67
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,926
It's supposed
to mean bad luck

68
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,770
Gladly

69
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,691
It's nice to see you
one more time... -

70
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,566
before you are a married woman.
Speaking of magic spells -

71
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,809
I wish you all
that's good and bright -

72
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,366
and that your choice
turns out to be the right one

73
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,691
I believe one is
allowed to kiss the bride

74
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,205
Here, dear brother,
sent for the bridegroom

75
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,123
I must also, without grudge,
congratulate you

76
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,287
Thank you. Don't forget us -

77
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,887
although we'll become
a steady married couple -

78
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,289
and then we'll have
a family doctor of our own

79
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,284
Where is your mistress?
- She'll be here soon

80
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,926
She's cooking in
the kitchen to celebrate, -

81
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,646
the rare guest

82
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,089
Welcome, Kris!

83
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,123
Why, this is a lucky elephant

84
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,529
How big and beautiful.
- I thought that if size -

85
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,240
has anything to do with
the amount of happiness

86
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,568
I did try to get
the size of the original

87
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,524
Oh, it's lovely

88
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,041
I wonder
where I should put it?

89
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,610
I was going to serve you
a model dinner, but...

90
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,487
Going to?... What but?

91
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,441
That was supposed
to be a delicious roast

92
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,367
But Eeva, you should
really start learning

93
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,005
Lauri, don't criticize...
I tried my best

94
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,482
Your roast knew my wish

95
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,451
Actually, I had a table
reserved at the Casino -

96
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,610
when Lauri called and invited
me. Now we'll all go there

97
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,162
To make up for the mishap,
I trust you'll let me foot the bill

98
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,482
Thank you.
Perhaps it is for the best, -

99
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,365
as it's difficult
to live on air alone

100
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,005
Let's go, Eeva

101
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,885
I'm sure you'll do
better next time

102
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,691
Eeva, what's the matter?
- Never mind. I'm fine

103
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,203
What an earth is the matter?

104
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,170
Can't you guess,
as a doctor?

105
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,005
Well, what would
bachelors know about that?

106
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,523
Listen, you'll have to go to
the Casino by yourself now

107
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,008
Our little mummy
is not up to it now

108
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,886
Why do you do that?
You'll tire yourself out

109
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,170
Why don't you take a maid?
- Lauri doesn't want to

110
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,325
I'll potter around here
until I get tired

111
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,808
I'll do anything else, -

112
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,810
but I can't
stand washing floors

113
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,847
My head is always
feeling strangely dizzy -

114
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,691
when I have to
bend down like that

115
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,081
I forbid it as a doctor
and talk to Lauri to get help

116
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,768
The tea water is hot

117
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,041
So that now you'll be
a good girl and drink this

118
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,526
What operetta
is being played here?

119
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,844
Oh, dear Lauri

120
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,884
I'll be arranging
an operetta for you soon -

121
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,084
with melodies
and performers

122
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,761
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray Thee my soul to keep

123
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,921
If I should die before I wake
I pray Thee my soul to take

124
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,049
Good Lord, bless farther,
mother and son, amen

125
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,929
Judge lsokari. - I must
disturb you this late -

126
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,363
as the acting director.
Pity it should happen just now, -

127
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,769
when the director is away.
They were bringing -

128
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,645
prisoners here by train
and at the station, -

129
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,366
a dangerous woman
prisoner escaped, -

130
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,006
so now we
have to arrange a hunt

131
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,449
She seems quite a slippery
character. - I'll be there

132
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,166
What now? - A dangerous
prisoner has escaped

133
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,721
Why did you
take on such a horrible job?

134
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,810
Now you have to run after
all kinds of criminals

135
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,721
I get angry if I start
thinking about the stupid job

136
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,843
No no, dear Eeva,
don't get worried

137
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,566
It's not dangerous,
and it won't take long

138
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,686
Not long... I must stay
alone all evening again

139
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,407
I hate the whole prison

140
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,924
Why don't you play
a guard as well, -

141
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,327
and see that Boy
doesn't run after me

142
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,243
Well, Boy,
running away again?

143
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,847
Come on, come home

144
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,161
What's that? - My foot.
I stepped on something

145
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,324
Can't see anything in this dark

146
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,887
It hurts terribly

147
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,808
Just a little thorn, that's all

148
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,406
I have always suspected this

149
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,125
Out from this house and fast!

150
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,482
Lauri, let me explain.
- No explanations!

151
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,329
There is the door, and quickly

152
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,285
Remember, you will not
be seen in this house again

153
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,802
No, I won't

154
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,970
You would have heard it
even without this farce

155
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,250
It can be done
also this way

156
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,128
Lauri, there is
a limit to everything

157
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,721
You'll apologize
to Kristian and me, too

158
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,322
Quiet, you... I can't
stand you before my eyes

159
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,564
Is this what you have
learned in your prison?

160
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,286
You're not the right one
to criticize my manners

161
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,165
You yourself are just
like the worst slut in there

162
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,886
If I am what you blame me for, -

163
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,969
it is best that I, too, leave

164
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,650
After your lover?

165
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,161
You don't have
to see me, or Kari

166
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,170
Go to hell
with your lies and threats

167
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,485
Did you lock
the door of Kari's room?

168
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,083
Would I give my child
to a woman like that?

169
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,602
You can never take
Kari from me

170
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,724
I have done nothing of
what you blame me for

171
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,729
I'll travel to to grandmother -

172
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,685
and tomorrow I'll fetch the
boy. You can be sure of that

173
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,530
Hello, lsokari.
- Is it you, Lauri?

174
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,521
Sorry to disturb you so early, -

175
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
but it is important

176
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,967
I cannot tell
you over the phone

177
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,042
I am not quite sure yet

178
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,924
You must come here. Come
straight away. - Is it about me?

179
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,685
Is there something...?
I'll come immediately

180
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,404
Shocking,
I wish this would end

181
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,484
Judge lsokari

182
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,487
Hello. - Hello

183
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,762
What has happened?

184
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,448
Your wife... - What about her?

185
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,721
Your wife left home last night.
- So she did. What about it?

186
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,845
That's Eeva's handbag.
- Yes, it is hers

187
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,442
What about that?
- That's hers as well

188
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,841
What has happened?
Where is Eeva? - Here

189
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,410
Eeva!

190
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,529
Eeva... How can
this have happened?

191
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,920
The railway guard
had found her on the rails

192
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,888
She has been
run over by a train

193
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,251
The whole train
must have gone over her

194
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,525
That's why I asked you
to come here to identify her

195
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,211
You know her.
She is your wife? - Yes

196
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,207
It is her.
Her clothes, everything

197
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,841
Here are some of
her letters and things

198
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,441
These were
found in her handbag

199
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,241
Is it true? Is it true?

200
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,523
I heard terrible
things at the station

201
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,967
ls Eeva...?

202
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,845
Is she dead? - Yes

203
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,646
She was run over
by a train last night

204
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,601
Good God, how?
How?

205
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,163
You know as much as I...
about yesterday

206
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,965
Leave me alone

207
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,164
You have already done
enough. - Lauri...

208
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,443
All my life you have hung
on to me, me and her

209
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,487
Look, I loved her, too

210
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,522
It wasn't her fault yesterday

211
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,327
I actually came to tell you
that I'm moving to the city, -

212
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,411
to say good bye.
She never gave any cause

213
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,609
I want you to know
that now, this moment

214
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,730
Eeva loved only you.
She never thought -

215
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,161
about anything else
but being faithful to you

216
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,931
And still she left
me alone. - Yes

217
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,648
We are both alone...
Both of us

218
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,081
Where have the gentlemen been?
- We went to see mother

219
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,881
It's a beautiful stone there

220
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,163
And always together,
Boy and you?

221
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,648
It's hard to watch it. It's
become angry to strangers

222
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,605
<i>Ja-a, poor Kari, -</i>

223
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,280
you must be
lonely here at home

224
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,128
Yes, when all the others
have brothers and sisters -

225
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,609
and everything,
and we have nothing, -

226
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,565
Now that even uncle Kristian
has moved to Helsinki

227
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,241
I guess you are right.
This won't do

228
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,726
I must arrange
something for us

229
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,603
Row, row

230
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,361
What an earth is there?
Mermaid?

231
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,042
Go on rowing, I need
waves around me. Row.

232
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,210
I am rowing, but if I obey,
I want to know the name -

233
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,131
of the mermaid? - Mythical
creatures don't have names

234
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,448
Not even a heart, as they say?

235
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,564
If you tease me
I'll catch you in my net

236
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,967
Try

237
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,801
Hey, hey over there, wake up!

238
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,529
We are at the end station

239
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,963
It's that crazy lifer.
Shall I fetch?

240
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,328
Good morning, director.
- Good morning

241
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,484
They sent 20 prisoners
from the prison

242
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,445
And that Vera Puranen is
one of them. - Who is that?

243
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,121
It's that famous murderer, -

244
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,171
who escaped from
the station on the way here

245
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,771
She got quite a knock on
her head during her escape -

246
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,248
and she's been confused,
but it could be just pretence, -

247
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,489
because they sent her here.
They say she has before -

248
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,524
pretended to be mixed up,
so that we don't have to worry

249
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,202
She won't get away this time?
- No, she is in leg irons

250
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,251
This is where she ended up,
although she didn't want -

251
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,408
to honour this house
with her presence

252
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,847
I wonder if the medical
examination is over?

253
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,010
Shall I bring them to you
after that? - Yes, do that

254
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,409
<i>50</i>

255
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,168
Well, get undressed!
- She doesn't want to

256
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,965
She comes
from the madhouse

257
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,401
Shall I undress her?
- No, no, leave it

258
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,688
This will do

259
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,321
Children, children, quickly
evening gowns on, -

260
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,729
the director is waiting

261
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,685
You have arrived here
to reconcile your crimes -

262
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,406
against the society.
We have hard discipline here -

263
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,921
but we treat you fairly

264
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,249
Anyone behaving badly
and breaking the rules, -

265
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,523
will have a difficult time here, -

266
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,122
but those who try
their best and behave well, -

267
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,689
they have a chance to shorten -

268
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,689
their time here considerably

269
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,565
Life is not easy,
especially for you -

270
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,809
but do not loose
your hope here

271
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,051
We do not forget
that you are human beings

272
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,003
People who suffer
and struggle with yourselves

273
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,850
Must be playing tricks again

274
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,281
Not this time

275
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,324
She gets those kinds of
attacks... She's a little weird

276
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,522
A little, eh? I would say a lot

277
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,883
Pretends that she doesn't
remember anything

278
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,806
Oh hell, that was
a smart thing to do

279
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,209
The old foxes know the tricks

280
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,042
Pick her up and make
sure she gets treatment

281
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,726
Wild bunch
these newcomers again

282
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,808
Sick in their minds
and sick in their bodies

283
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,687
This is the house
for miserable people

284
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,089
I feel like a prisoner
myself inside these walls

285
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,290
But tomorrow is Sunday
and then this guy -

286
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,404
is going to the forest,
into the sunny nature

287
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,242
That Boy sure
found a beautiful prey

288
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,370
Why don't you call, that
dreadfully angry beast away

289
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,206
Boy, come here and be quiet

290
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,484
The master is happy
to take care of talking

291
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,450
No, but has the mermaid
come onto dry land?

292
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,885
No, but is the big fisherman
on the move again?

293
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,646
Yes, and this time
you won't get away -

294
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,889
like the last time. - Well,
unfortunately it's not possible

295
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,128
I hurt my foot
on the rocks over there -

296
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,529
I limped on for a while,
but then it got so swollen, -

297
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,041
that my journey ended here

298
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,447
Who told you to
go trekking in the forest?

299
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,642
I was looking for good views

300
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,248
Aha, you are an artist.
- Something like it

301
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,847
What will you do to me now?

302
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,083
I'll take you to the civilization

303
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,328
Just get up.
- Not possible

304
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,162
I can't leave you here
in the forest to starve

305
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,210
What do you suggest?
- Take me in your arms

306
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,167
And now, I can't carry
you for kilometers?

307
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,603
You don't have to,
I saw a forest hut nearby

308
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,769
Oh dear, it hurts badly

309
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,844
Perhaps this helps

310
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,407
Wonderful, it helps

311
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,563
I feel good

312
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,644
All right, you can go on with
your hunting. - I don't want to

313
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,169
I will stay with you
until I get you home

314
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,810
Actually... What is your
name? - I am Riitta

315
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,569
What about you?
- Then I am Lauri

316
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,200
Aren't you hungry?
- Terribly hungry

317
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,364
I could eat a whole elk

318
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,041
Roasted grouse will do.
- Wonderful

319
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,561
Can you do it?
- We'll see

320
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,206
This was a wonderful meal.
You must be a restaurant chef

321
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,610
Not quite. Guess again.
- No, I don't want to know

322
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,883
You are Lauri and I am Riitta.
It's enough here in the forest

323
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,321
It would spoil the
atmosphere, if I knew, -

324
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,569
that you are a wholesaler,
doctor, baker or chimney sweep

325
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,604
Isn't it more exciting
that I'm just Riitta, -

326
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,361
and not some seamstress,
sales assistant or something?

327
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,121
You are right, I don't
like to talk about my job

328
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,164
You must be a hangman
or something else dreadful

329
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,648
Almost.
But aren't you sleepy?

330
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,681
Really. I could sleep
even for ten hours

331
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,604
Then eyes closed and
sweet dreams. Good night

332
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,561
What about you,
where will you sleep?

333
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,565
It's warm summer night and
soft moss on the ground

334
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,366
Out of the question.
I'm not afraid of you

335
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,927
You'll sleep here. - But...

336
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,210
But if I'm afraid of you?
- I won't bite

337
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,651
He's not coming.
Let go

338
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,563
Bye bye!

339
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,010
Puranen shall
start the cleaning here

340
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,241
There's no point in
showing off with your amnesia -

341
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,250
nor that you're crazy.
The floor has to be cleaned

342
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,689
On your knees,
you'll get the hang of it

343
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,041
It's best to do as they say, -

344
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,130
otherwise they can send
you to the peat marshes

345
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,448
Look father,
who I brought here

346
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,928
Uncle Kristian didn't
know about your new job

347
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,443
We came, as Uncle Kristian
is here for such a short time

348
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,364
He'll continue his journey
today. - What a coincidence

349
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,961
And now we'll go for
breakfast at our house

350
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,887
I don't like it at all
that Kari stays around here

351
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,005
This is not a suitable place
for children, actually nobody

352
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,365
Must watch out and be careful

353
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,002
Hey, hey...

354
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,648
Damn it, I promised
to make a house call

355
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,010
You go ahead, I'll follow
soon. - All right

356
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,646
Come quickly. Let's go,
Kari. - No, no, father

357
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,561
I want to go with
Uncle Kristian. Can I?

358
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,410
Let the boy come

359
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,841
No walking, it's best to get -

360
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,088
crutches from the hospital

361
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,009
How about a wheelchair?

362
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,806
There is one in
the guest house store

363
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,651
That's fine,
I doubt if the lady -

364
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,808
keeps still
for long otherwise

365
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,641
It's best to show the foot
to a doctor after a while

366
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,368
The wheelchair is fun,
almost like a car

367
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,128
Who are you?
- This is Kari lsokari

368
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,402
Judge lsokari's son

369
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,285
He was supposed
to wait outside in the car, -

370
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,087
but as you are here,
come and say hello

371
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,087
Nice to meet you Mr. lsokari.
But now I have an idea

372
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,047
If you like the water so much, -

373
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,005
it could benefit us both

374
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,363
Would you be my model for
a couple of days? - A model?

375
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,767
Quite naked? - No, not at all

376
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,170
I would only paid your face.
- Well, that's all right then, -

377
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,364
if it's only the face

378
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,924
Goodness, is that you again!

379
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,168
I must say that you choose -

380
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,806
the most extraordinary
ways to appear

381
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,163
Do you know her, father?
- I could almost say so

382
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,367
But where did you find her?
- Well, over there

383
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,484
I was just going to push
these carriages, they are nice

384
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,126
Then she asked
if she could paint my face

385
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,163
Should I ask you?

386
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,647
Does the Judge have
anything against it?

387
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,401
Kari and I are charmed
and I would hope that this time -

388
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,968
you will not disappear as
suddenly as you usually do

389
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,401
and have
a habit of appearing

390
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,209
The painting and that chair
are hopefully keeping you -

391
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,529
here for a long time.
It's very lonely here

392
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,326
And there have been
no women for a long time

393
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,050
Except that Mimmi

394
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,082
Really boring

395
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,921
Who can sit quietly all his life?

396
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,449
I thought that painting
a face would be quick

397
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,128
Listen, how long are you
going to draw the whole body?

398
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,131
What drawing, Riitta?

399
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,688
Now split. - Why?

400
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,089
There are times when
children are not needed

401
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,091
Seems that the boy
is wiser than I thought

402
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,041
He is sometimes
almost precocious

403
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,561
He has been alone so much

404
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,368
When I get
onto my feet again, -

405
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,609
let me start doing
things for you here?

406
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,765
The place really needs
a woman's touch

407
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,487
Let me cook a little and
do some housekeeping -

408
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,923
to pay for this great model
before my holiday is over

409
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,604
Bloody idiot, you'll
burn yourself and others

410
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,007
There you see
the director's washing

411
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,362
I told you that
they must be kept separate

412
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,042
So that they can be
taken care of by someone, -

413
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,971
who knows what to do, not
someone who's asleep

414
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,961
Leena, you start washing them.
Vera can take your job

415
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,686
Hey you,
bring them here quickly

416
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,406
Get on with it, what
are you waiting for?

417
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,726
Are you going
to steal it or what?

418
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,568
Give it here. You won't
get far with it in this house

419
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,926
Gentlemen,
the celebrations start

420
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,928
Well, Kari, what do you think
of yourself? - Yes it's good

421
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,329
But I think
these are even better

422
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,889
Listen, Riitta, you must have
spoiled that boy with your food

423
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,765
But now ends both
the spoiling and the holiday

424
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,249
What? Isn't Aunt Riitta
coming here any more?

425
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,569
It seems not, unless
you and I find a way -

426
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,366
to keep her here for good

427
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,764
Kari, I assume you'd also
like her to stay?

428
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,566
Yes, making things like this

429
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,811
Unless she gets the spirit
again and starts painting

430
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,769
Bye then

431
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,365
What would you say
if I'd ask you to move here -

432
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,122
and become a mother
to two lonely men

433
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,331
I cannot let you go away.
Stay here

434
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,127
Well... I was just going to get
some of these for my friends

435
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,443
Good thing you came.
I have good news for you

436
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,801
Riitta is going to stay, she'll
be a new mother to you

437
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,650
Mother...

438
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,129
Lauri... Kari didn't like that

439
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,083
Perhaps he doesn't want me
to stay after all. - Don't be silly

440
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,841
Of course he wants it.
You are so good friends

441
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,522
The boy must be surprised.
Who knows, maybe he is wiser -

442
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,963
than his father and made a
bunch of flowers for the bride

443
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,127
Quiet, you slut!
Go to hell from this house!

444
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,963
Find out what the screaming
in the church was about

445
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,447
Yes, director, we'll find out

446
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,803
Who knows, maybe they'll
get help in the peat marsh

447
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,402
As long as you find out.
Though it may not be malicious

448
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,806
I have a private
matter for the pastor

449
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,368
I thought about asking
you home, as there is -

450
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,643
simple and
humble wedding

451
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,323
Uncle Kristian,
how come you are here?

452
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,201
I visit here more often
than you realise

453
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,888
Always when I'm around
these parts, I come also here

454
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,250
I also miss
your mother deeply

455
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,729
Uncle Kristian, it's good that
we both still remember, -

456
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,681
and not me alone.
- All right, Kari

457
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,603
You seem to be worried
about something special

458
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,282
Let's talk and
clear things up man to man

459
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,764
Is it about Auntie Riitta?

460
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,440
Don't you like her?
- It's not that

461
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,446
I do like her. She is nice, -

462
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,521
but, oh, Uncle Kristian,
everything is so silly

463
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,800
I didn't understand
that she'll be coming -

464
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,048
to us to live and sleep

465
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,481
Father said that she'll
be a new mother

466
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,126
and now she's there
like a mother

467
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,486
Isn't it wrong that she's
taking my mother's place, -

468
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,048
as if mother never existed

469
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,925
I think it's terrible, -

470
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,964
although Auntie Riitta
is really all right

471
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:20,842
Poor Kari, I understand you,
but if Riitta -

472
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:25,841
is good and kind to you,
you must get used to it

473
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,647
It's no fault of hers, either, -

474
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,525
that she met your father,
liked him and you, -

475
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,042
and didn't want to give him up.
And surely it's nicer at home -

476
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,210
much nicer when she's there
taking care of everything

477
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,326
She's no bad stepmother,
like in story books

478
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,086
No, that's true

479
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,602
Tell me, Uncle Kristian,
was my mother beautiful?

480
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,410
Yes, very beautiful

481
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,807
Do you still remember?
- Just a little

482
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,011
Mother smiled a lot
and sang sometimes

483
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,846
She had soft hands

484
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,086
Good God, how
I pity those poor people

485
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,006
So do I, although
nobody would believe it

486
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,283
Luckily I'll soon get away

487
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,371
I only promised to be in
this job for a couple of years

488
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,006
I was so down
that nothing mattered -

489
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,682
but now I'd
like to leave everything -

490
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,884
and start again

491
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,845
it starts to feel better,
although these last days -

492
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,008
have felt twice as difficult

493
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,044
Listen, I have decided to
do the best picture of my life

494
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,891
I have often watched
the face of one prisoner

495
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,209
It reflects unspoken
suffering and pain

496
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,485
She is like a martyr,
with a look like a sleepwalker's

497
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,041
I have always wanted
a model like that

498
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,971
Promise to give her to me
as a model, dear Lauri

499
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,369
Well, I don't know, you can't
paint here. - I'll take her home

500
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,564
She's not dangerous and
the guard can follow her

501
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,560
Dear Lauri, send herhere.
Her number is 311

502
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,448
I can't deny you anything.
I'll try to arrange it

503
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,725
Come in, Vera,
don't be afraid

504
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,330
You can stay here. There
is some coffee for you

505
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,041
We will manage with Vera

506
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,368
Come now, Vera

507
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,050
Well, Vera, there's
nothing to be afraid of here

508
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,448
You poor thing

509
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,087
You must have suffered a lot

510
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,005
Don't be afraid,
I'll be good to you

511
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,125
Wait a moment

512
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,122
How dirty you are...

513
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,369
Per... fume

514
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,405
Perfume. - Yes it is

515
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,000
But, good God,
you are beautiful

516
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,125
Oh Vera,
this is strange

517
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,563
My name is not Vera

518
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,248
What is it then?

519
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,406
I don't know

520
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,641
I don't know

521
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,762
I don't remember. - It
doesn't matter, take it easy

522
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,166
You'll be all right here

523
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,242
Roses...

524
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,650
They are mine, mine

525
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,484
Try to sit
quietly for a moment

526
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,968
Nothing much
is going to happen

527
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,406
Lucky elephant

528
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,241
The bigger it is
the bigger the happiness

529
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,440
I tried to get one
the size of the original

530
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,209
I know this

531
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,202
What is this? - It's an
elephant, it brings luck

532
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,491
Luck...

533
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,690
Boy, boy...

534
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,529
Beautiful boy

535
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,251
Who's son?

536
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,847
My son. - No. No, no

537
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,325
Come and sit sown again

538
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,450
Have you got a son?

539
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,605
Dog! - Careful, careful!

540
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,127
Boy is angry to strangers

541
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,524
Yes, Boy... Boy...

542
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,082
Come here, nice dog

543
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,041
Did Boy run here?

544
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,122
Listen, Kari,
please go out for a while, -

545
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,120
I'm painting. Please go, Kari

546
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,768
Kari...

547
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,044
Kari... Kari...

548
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,606
This is Kari

549
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,848
No, don't go away!

550
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,567
No, don't go away.
- Let me go, let me go!

551
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,922
No, don't go away

552
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:32,327
Kari, don't go away.
- Let me go!

553
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,242
No, no, no

554
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,006
Just go quietly

555
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,527
Don't be afraid
any more, Kari

556
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,250
She's just an unhappy,
poor person

557
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,564
Maybe she, too,
has a son

558
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,201
She knew my name

559
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,367
How did she know that?

560
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,320
I mentioned it

561
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,481
But how Boy...?

562
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,402
Listen, Lauri...
- I'm listening, darling

563
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,844
That prisoner was here

564
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,963
She was a strange woman

565
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,891
She got an attack and
frightened even Kari badly

566
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,447
That's what comes from, -

567
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,689
dragging all kinds of weirdoes
here. - You must be right

568
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,084
I feel as if that
person is sick in the head

569
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,284
You should
have her examined

570
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,403
I don't think a prison is
the right place for her kind

571
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,964
Yes, Mrs. Director.
Your word is my command

572
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,490
Well, difficult to
make any sense of that

573
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,683
Indeed

574
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,328
What is her name? - Vera.
They call her Puranen

575
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,489
Why is that?
- No real reason

576
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,805
Well, what are you doing
here? - I came to get father

577
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,088
Go and wait
in the guardhouse

578
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,204
You know you must not
wonder around here?

579
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,287
March, march, march

580
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,611
Don't even think about it.
Now you are coming out

581
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,489
You wait here while I take
this Lyyti into the kitchen

582
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,082
Well, Vera, where
have you been loitering?

583
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,684
But, what the hell

584
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,521
Where is Vera? I locked
her in here an hour ago

585
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,486
Alert, a prisoner has escaped!

586
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,248
Director, a prisoner
has escaped. - Who?

587
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,364
It's that Vera Puranen, who
was modeling for your wife

588
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,689
Why the hell wasn't I told,
that she's dangerous

589
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,646
But the Director himself
said number 311

590
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,163
She's been so quiet recently
that she's hardly said a word

591
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,489
Search the whole prison
and the surrounding area

592
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,208
Don't take it so seriously

593
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,529
You needn't worry about
the fate of a strange prisoner

594
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,122
Leave your work worries
till tomorrow and come to bed

595
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,802
It wouldn't worry me otherwise, -

596
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,606
but because I myself
let her be brought here -

597
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,249
for your silliness and she got
the idea to escape from that

598
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,162
Lauri... Lauri

599
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,050
Kari, what are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

600
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,722
Answer. - Well, there is...

601
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,449
She's hungry.
- Who? Answer now

602
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,650
Who is there?- Look

603
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,243
Good God, I'm going crazy

604
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:24,364
Eeva, Eeva,
are you really alive?

605
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,169
I have seen
your mutilated body

606
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,565
I have lowered you
into the grave myself

607
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,087
Your are here. You are alive

608
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,524
Can't you talk? What
have they done to you?

609
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,406
Can't you tell me
where you have been?

610
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,846
What has
disturbed your mind?

611
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,041
Can you hear what I'm saying?
Don't you know me?

612
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,924
Eeva, I am Lauri,
your husband

613
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,689
Don't be afraid,
I'm not afraid, either

614
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,210
What? What do
you know about this?

615
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,925
Nothing, I just knew her

616
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,771
There is a scary
secret hidden in this

617
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:17,331
This isn't happening,
this is impossible

618
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,649
There must
be an explanation

619
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,451
Good God, Riitta!

620
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,565
What has happened?
Who are you bringing in here?

621
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,046
Something
terrible has happened

622
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,727
I don't know how to tell you

623
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,926
But you are brave, always
wanting to know everything

624
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,761
You know that I love you -

625
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:12,124
more than anything
in this world. Now...

626
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,567
This is impossible

627
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,560
The dead stay in their graves
and don't haunt us as prisoners

628
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,321
She can't be a criminal

629
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,601
Father, father, father,
she's gone, she has left!

630
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,289
lsokari here, the
search must be resumed

631
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,721
She is wondering
somewhere here

632
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,048
Yes, all men to the
search, is that clear?

633
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,004
I'll go with the men

634
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,326
She is coming towards
the city in my car

635
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,090
Yes, she took it from the yard

636
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,363
Can you try and arrange
from there...? - Yes

637
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,444
Yes

638
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,371
I'll do everything I can

639
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,169
Get me the radio police

640
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,728
No, let me go!

641
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,281
Let me go, I don't want
back in the box!

642
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,769
Eeva, don't you know me?
- No, no, I don't want to

643
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:41,849
Away, away! Not in the box,
not in the box, not in the box!

644
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,364
Operating Theatre

645
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,320
How did it go?
- I don't know for sure yet

646
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,048
She is very weak

647
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,004
She had wound in her head, -

648
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,009
which has been
caused by a hard blow

649
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,124
The bones were fractured and
a splinter pressed the brain -

650
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,290
impairing her functioning
and causing the amnesia

651
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,568
Now that the operation
has been done,-

652
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,808
the brain may
again function normally -

653
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,604
and she
may gain her memory

654
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,009
it may also return
slowly, step by step

655
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,204
I'll follow her progress -

656
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,244
and she should gain
consciousness in the morning

657
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,647
I'll let you know straight away

658
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,201
Water

659
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,409
Kris, you are here?

660
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,088
What has happened?

661
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,690
Where is Lauri?
- He is here

662
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,088
Where am I?
You talk quite...

663
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,605
What has happened?

664
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,044
You have been very ill,
very ill for a long time

665
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,489
You have hurt your head...
- No, but where is Lauri?

666
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,049
Lauri!

667
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,122
What now? - She's
gained consciousness

668
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,563
Does she remember?
Has she explained? - No

669
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,407
She may not remember
anything for a while

670
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,121
She is very weak
and the slightest shock -

671
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,210
could be disasterous.
We must continue as if -

672
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,687
these interim years
never happened, -

673
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,724
until we get
over the worst crisis

674
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,481
She was asking for you, Lauri,
but do remember, Lauri, -

675
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,286
not to tell her yet

676
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,084
Please forgive me
that silly quarrel?

677
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,966
We both got
excited for nothing

678
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,483
I was supposed to go to see ?
Am I still expected?

679
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,167
No, I don't think so

680
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,282
Listen, Eeva, try to remember...
- Remember what?

681
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,688
I can't remember anything

682
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,531
It's like there was a big wall

683
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,886
Everything is completely dark

684
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,321
Why don't I remember?

685
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,647
Kari, my son Kari! - Mother!

686
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,889
Kari... But you have changed

687
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,089
Grown...

688
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,968
But...

689
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:04,041
For heaven's sake, I have
seen you as you are, grown

690
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:13,009
Have I been ill for so long?
- Very long, Eeva

691
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,767
Try to remember,
what happened to you then

692
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,761
No...

693
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,723
No!

694
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,291
I can't remember

695
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,368
Don't pester me, I want
to go away from here!

696
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,011
Home, away from here.
Home

697
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,928
Home. She stubbornly
demands to go home

698
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,002
It's only a question of time until
she figures of the whole thing

699
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,489
The best and the only way
would be for her to end up -

700
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,490
back in the same
place where it all started

701
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,644
But she must not yet
be shocked with the fact, -

702
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,447
that you have remarried.
It could spoil everything

703
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,128
But it's impossible. Eeva and
Riitta, what would become of that?

704
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,847
But if it is the only solution?
You should try and endure this

705
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,369
Of course she can come.
- Do you really agree?

706
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,528
Of course
we must do everything

707
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,769
I can be, say,
a housekeeper at home

708
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,731
Riitta, it is not possible.
I can't be done

709
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,163
That's right, and we won't
continue for too long

710
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,408
This thing is also
so near to my heart, -

711
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,047
that I'll be arranging
a locum for myself here

712
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,242
I will come there with you

713
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:27,248
You must go and rest in bed.
- Already?

714
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,922
You, Kari, will be bringing
my evening tea to me in bed?

715
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,371
Lauri, aren't you coming?

716
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,885
Are you planning to put me
somewhere in this house -

717
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,163
or how are we going to live?
- Of course you'll stay here

718
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,323
Goodness knows
what can happen here?

719
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,251
I have arranged
the upstairs lounge for you

720
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,169
Come here

721
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,442
Well, Lauri...

722
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,688
Come

723
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,325
Eeva dear, I still have
some things to do

724
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,727
All right,
everything is fine so far

725
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,290
But tomorrow is another day

726
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,802
Good morning, Kari.
- Good morning, mother

727
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,370
Where is farther?

728
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:45,121
Oh, he's left the house
already ages ago

729
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,687
Good morning.
- Good morning

730
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,729
Please come and
have some coffee

731
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,724
Run,Kari, and fetch
Uncle Kristian for coffee

732
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:03,090
It is nice that you
have coffee with us

733
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,450
Good morning.
- Good morning

734
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,690
So, how are you today?
- Very well

735
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,889
Very pleasant,
don't you think?

736
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,450
Whose things are these?
- Riitta's

737
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,243
Oh, she keeps
her things in here

738
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,764
Well, my son, it's
time you went to bed

739
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,128
Not yet

740
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,886
I must go to the office still

741
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:32,681
Mother... Don't mind them.
They are married

742
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,961
Uncle Kristian, Uncle Kristian,
I have made a terrible mistake

743
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:48,324
I blurted out to mother,
that they are married

744
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:51,928
I don't know, what came over her.
Come quickly, come quickly

745
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,241
Why didn't you tell me?
Why? Why?

746
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,085
We couldnt. I knew
that it would upset you

747
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,048
Dear Eeva... - I want
to leave straight away

748
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,281
I don't want to stay
for another moment

749
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,285
You must take me
somewhere. At once

750
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,122
Mother, mother, I'll come
with you, I'll come with you!

751
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,003
No!

752
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:22,002
Is that the true story?

753
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,844
It is quite unbelievable

754
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:32,287
An escaped prisoner, whose
life you had to continue

755
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,609
