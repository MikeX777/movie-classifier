1
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,118
Daddy William!

2
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,719
Daddy William!

3
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,832
Don't let them take you away!

4
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,409
Momma needs you, we need you.

5
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,819
Now go home, child.

6
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,107
Ain't nothing you can do.

7
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,603
I belong to Legree now.

8
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,506
When you coming home?

9
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,209
Never, child!

10
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:24,322
Now you go home,

11
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:27,524
tell your mama I love her,

12
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:29,408
and you, too.

13
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,607
Now get!

14
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,411
Now that's a fine young filly.

15
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,102
Let her be.

16
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:43,402
Now why should I do that, boy?

17
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:46,018
Run, child!

18
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:57,292
Not if you wanna live, nigger.

19
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,901
Daddy!

20
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,876
Daddy!

21
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,813
Hey, boy, I'm gonna fuck your daughter!

22
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,610
Don't let them hurt me!

23
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,703
He gets all the fun.

24
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,817
Let's move them out.

25
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:18,430
He can catch up later.

26
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,111
Come on, nigger.

27
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,723
Hey, get up there.
Move.

28
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,508
Move!

29
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,505
No!

30
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:45,843
My land, childrens,
ain't they any other place

31
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:48,005
for y'all to sit except on the stairs?

32
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,114
Morning, Eliza.

33
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,716
I see you're busy already.

34
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,844
Master going out?
- These aren't Master Shelby's

35
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,216
boots, they belong to the guest.

36
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:56,621
Guest?
Ain't nobody told me about no guest,

37
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,439
that's for sure certain, and Mr. Shelby

38
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,121
always tells me when they's company.

39
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,817
Well, his boots are here.

40
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,224
May I come in, sir?
- Yes.

41
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,712
I brought your boots, sir.

42
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,718
All right.

43
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:33,414
Help me on with them.

44
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,816
What's your name?

45
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,202
Eliza, sir.

46
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:45,423
You've done a
good job on them, Eliza.

47
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:46,808
Thank you, sir.

48
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,800
Are you always so shy?

49
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,208
Is anything wrong?

50
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,526
No, sir.

51
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,317
You have a man, Eliza?

52
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:58,604
Oh, yes, sir.

53
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,292
I should think so.

54
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,378
He's a lucky man, you're very pretty.

55
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,226
I suppose he'd like to marry you.

56
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,015
We are married, sir.

57
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:07,913
That's nice.
- Only I don't live with him.

58
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,814
Our neighbor's his master.

59
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,620
He's hired at the hemp mill.

60
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,916
So he works for old Mr. Wilson?

61
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,407
What's his name?

62
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,315
Harris, sir, Jim Harris.

63
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,003
Do you know him?

64
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:21,889
No.

65
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,917
Now can I go, please?

66
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,807
You're very pretty, Eliza.

67
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,216
How'd you like me to buy
you and take you home?

68
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,618
Are you afraid of me?

69
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,017
No, sir.

70
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,724
Or of the South, perhaps.

71
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:02,513
It's nice down there.

72
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,524
But I'm very
happy right here, sir.

73
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,113
Come back here later.

74
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,211
I won't do it.

75
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,726
Annie can just bring his water up to him.

76
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,605
I'm not going up there.

77
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:45,068
I'd rather throw myself in the river.

78
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,777
Child, you supposed to be a Christian.

79
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:47,980
Stop talking like that.

80
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,668
They want us all to be good Christians,

81
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,418
but they talk about it
one way and do us another.

82
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,989
What's got into you, Eliza, honey?

83
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,219
You look like you seen the ole
devil himself this morning.

84
00:09:57,592 --> 00:10:00,203
I never gave thought to
what the devil looks like,

85
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:03,115
but I bet he looks a
powerful lot like him.

86
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:10,512
You wanna see me, Mr. Morrison?

87
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,536
You think I rode 10
miles for the fun of it?

88
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,809
Where's Harris?

89
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,614
What do you want with him?

90
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:18,094
Is it all right with you, Wilson,

91
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,200
if I sell my own slave?

92
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,934
Does it have to be Harris?

93
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,112
He's the best man I hired from you.

94
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,505
I know what I'm doing,
Wilson, so don't butt in.

95
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,313
But you'll want to see this
machine he built over here.

96
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,608
He invented it himself.

97
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,985
It does the work of six slaves.

98
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:33,301
I don't know anything about machines
and I don't wanna.

99
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,512
I'd rather use slaves,
they don't get rusty.

100
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,119
That's all I need, ain't it,

101
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,114
for some uppity nigger to
start inventing things?

102
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,918
You keep your place, hear?

103
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,512
You have no right
to do that, Mr. Morrison.

104
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,131
I didn't rent you any brains, Wilson,

105
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,628
just a pair of arms.

106
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,034
I asked for good
workers, and I got them.

107
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,722
He's the best man I have.

108
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,417
Don't take him away, I'll buy him myself.

109
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:04,030
Legree's my friend, he
paid a good price for him.

110
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,015
He'll teach him what it means to work.

111
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,521
Go on, inventor.

112
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,912
Get moving!

113
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,607
Don't take him away
from me, Mr. Morrison.

114
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,708
I'll pay more than you're
getting from Mr. Legree.

115
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,427
Forget it, Wilson, he's going to Legree.

116
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,120
I can do what I want with my own property.

117
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,212
I'll pay you $1,000 for him.

118
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:29,018
Nothing doing, I told you, he's sold.

119
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,918
1,500, Mr. Morrison.

120
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,714
2,000!

121
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,903
You'll never see him again.

122
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,015
Run!

123
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:26,718
Tomorrow, there'll be a reward notice

124
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,929
on every tree from here to Kentucky!

125
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,411
Have you been comfortable
with us, Mr. Legree?

126
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,716
Now that business is out
of the way, yes, ma'am.

127
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,020
Where's your son?
What's his name again?

128
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,011
George.

129
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,210
Please?
- Oh, thank you.

130
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,753
He knows I hate unpunctuality.

131
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:56,550
He's probably with Uncle Tom.

132
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,215
He can look at a watch,
can't he, wherever he is.

133
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,425
Well, time's not
important when you're young.

134
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,116
He'll be old enough
for college next year.

135
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:06,398
College, that'll be
pretty expensive, won't it?

136
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:08,600
Well, with a big,
beautiful estate like this,

137
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,714
you can afford it, I guess, hmm?

138
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:12,924
With plenty of hard work, Mr. Legree.

139
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:14,601
How well I know, madam.

140
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,710
I've a plantation of my own down river.

141
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,011
Down river?

142
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,206
Near Natchez, ma'am.

143
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,714
1,000 acres of long staple cotton.

144
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,658
That's the only crop you can make money on

145
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,015
because of the climate.

146
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,408
Swamp fever.

147
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,214
We lose a lot of slaves.

148
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:31,019
But that's life there.

149
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,146
Excuse us, please, for being late.
We were listening to the singing.

150
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:42,611
I don't believe you've met
the children yet, Mr. Legree.

151
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:44,253
This is our Virginia.

152
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,765
The reports didn't do
you justice, young lady.

153
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,822
How do you do?

154
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,408
May I offer my congratulations?

155
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,712
How do you do, sir?

156
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,810
Did you enjoy the spirituals?

157
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,505
Yes, it was just lovely.

158
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,017
They like to sing.

159
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,714
Good thing, too, helps my business.

160
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,677
It helps them work harder, is that it?

161
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:12,517
Naturally there's more
profit in a happy nigger.

162
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:16,497
For instance, take this case
I heard of the other day.

163
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:19,755
There was this man, trader I know,

164
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:21,516
bought a woman with a child,

165
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,342
but he didn't have any use for the baby,

166
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:24,625
so he sold it.

167
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,314
Stupid thing to do.

168
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:29,111
The mother killed herself.

169
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,493
$1,000 wasted through mismanagement.

170
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:34,626
The baby always goes with his
mother, that's what I say.

171
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,509
It's just awful, isn't it?

172
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,017
What can you do?

173
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,208
The man had a law on his side.

174
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:42,614
Laws like that should be abolished.

175
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,579
You planning to be a lawyer, boy?

176
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,223
I haven't decided on a career.

177
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,715
I do know what I don't wanna be, however.

178
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:50,609
What's that, young fella?

179
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,922
A slave trader, Mr. Legree.
- George!

180
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,665
A slave trader has to earn his living,

181
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:56,125
just like everybody else.

182
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,519
Aren't there other ways?

183
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,121
I guess that depends.

184
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,625
You're young, you're nice and gentle.

185
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,719
So, for you, life should
be easy and beautiful,

186
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,820
like yourself.

187
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,273
As his life is ugly.

188
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,521
George, how dare you.

189
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,019
Apologize, do you hear?

190
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,703
I'm sorry, Father, but I
will not apologize to him.

191
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,758
George.

192
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:23,680
Come back at once!
- Go after him, dear.

193
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,548
Do you think I should?

194
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,508
Certainly, my child, go ahead.

195
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:50,335
Going away to college
might do him some good.

196
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:56,595
Nice evening.

197
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,414
Well, I won't stay any longer.

198
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,408
Master, made him my master.

199
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,124
What right does he have to own me?

200
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:16,502
I'm a man just like he is.

201
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,112
I'm not some kind of
a machine or an animal

202
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,307
to be bought and abused and sold.

203
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,729
I'll never be an animal again.

204
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,510
What will you do?

205
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,807
I don't know, go to Canada.

206
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,315
They're good people there.

207
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,127
No slaves, only freemen.

208
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:38,006
I'll make lots of dollars,

209
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:40,615
I'll make thousands and
thousands of dollars.

210
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll buy you both back.

211
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,705
Yes, you and the baby, too.

212
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,605
Be careful, Harris, you're hurt,

213
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,932
and it's so cold and the river's frozen.

214
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:50,412
Don't worry about me.

215
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,323
I'll come back for you.

216
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,417
I'll be all right.

217
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:04,419
Take care of yourself.
- I have to go now,

218
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,909
I have to run before
Morrison gets after me.

219
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,823
I'll wait for you forever.

220
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,010
Forever.

221
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,014
No, Mr. Shelby
wouldn't say that.

222
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,517
Shelby wouldn't do that.

223
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,619
They said they wouldn't do that.

224
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,501
What y'all hanging 'round for?
Get to work.

225
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:50,208
There's a bad man with a scar
hanging around the place.

226
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,509
That's Mr. Legree, he's
a guest of the master.

227
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,033
That's just it, Mr. Shelby's
gonna sell some of us.

228
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:56,091
What you talking about?

229
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,509
That fellow Sambo who come with him...
- There's Mr. Shelby.

230
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,732
Morning, Mr. Shelby.

231
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,923
I'd like to talk to
you alone for a minute, Tom.

232
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,017
Yes, sir.

233
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,525
All right, get to
work, everybody, go on.

234
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,808
Go on, put your arms into it.

235
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,920
That Sambo of Mr. Legree,
he's started a lot of talk

236
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,015
about how you wanna sell some of us,

237
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,507
and they've gone half-crazy.

238
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:19,007
I beg of you, Tom,
please don't make things

239
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,413
any harder for me than they are.

240
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,405
Well, I'd never do that to you, sir.

241
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,166
Why, ever since we were little boys,

242
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:26,218
we been looking after one another.

243
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,108
Tom, suppose that
this isn't just a rumor,

244
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:33,925
that I've been obliged
to have sold some of you.

245
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:38,608
Then, then I knowed it
must be hard times for sure.

246
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,557
Why else would you be fixing to sell

247
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,511
any of us off the plantation?

248
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,413
I knowed lessen you had to,

249
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,065
you wouldn't never do nothing like that.

250
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:46,960
Where you going?

251
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,604
I'm getting my other shirt.

252
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:51,417
But, Tom, there's no
question of your going.

253
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,011
Why, you're as much a part
of the Shelby plantation

254
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,612
as I am myself.

255
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,408
All us is part of the Shelby plantation,

256
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,218
like one big ole family.

257
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:03,409
Mr. Shelby, if you are gonna sell anyone,

258
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,511
please, sir, I want you to sell me.

259
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,127
It say here in the Bible,

260
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,506
no one has greater love than this,

261
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:14,616
to lay down his life for a friend.

262
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,710
If you don't want me to do it for you,

263
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:20,308
then I'll do it for Master George, sir.

264
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,620
Don't listen to him, sir,
don't listen to what he says.

265
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,870
Please, sir, don't let him go away.

266
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,925
They ain't nothing about
going in the Bible.

267
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:29,507
Know what it says there?

268
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:32,308
Tom, stay where you at.
- The Bible don't say one word about that.

269
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,421
Then put it in!

270
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,819
What's the matter, George?

271
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,030
I'm gonna horsewhip Legree.

272
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,397
He's a guest, your
father will be disgraced.

273
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,037
He's already disgraced himself.

274
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,819
But I beg you, please,
don't start trouble.

275
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,924
Virginia, it's not a
question of starting trouble.

276
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,268
But I'm not gonna just be idle

277
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,119
while something like this
is happening to our people.

278
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,328
I must speak to George for a minute.

279
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,030
Will you excuse us, Virginia?

280
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,414
Have we anything left
to talk about, sir?

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,289
Yes, all the things I've
been keeping to myself

282
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,219
in order to spare your mother and you.

283
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,082
Does watching
our people being sold

284
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,812
like a bunch of animals
spare our feelings?

285
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,863
I've been doing everything I
possibly could to avoid this.

286
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:20,066
I've borrowed money
from all of my friends,

287
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,416
I've sold most of your mother's jewelry.

288
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,414
In heaven's name, what else could I do?

289
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,512
Stop being hypocritical.

290
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,207
How many times have you said you despise

291
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,316
slave traders like Simon Legree?

292
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,425
You're talking of things
you're too young to understand.

293
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:36,112
Too young?

294
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,284
Isn't it odd how that's
always the argument

295
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:39,440
when you know that I'm in the right?

296
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,307
George, I will overlook
your lack of respect

297
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,104
under the circumstances.

298
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,964
I even understand how you feel.

299
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:46,612
It affects you just as it does me.

300
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,417
Those are the ones
who are affected by it,

301
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:49,917
those people out there.

302
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,511
Come here and look at them.

303
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:59,222
Hey, man, go on, move.

304
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:01,009
See what they're doing?

305
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,702
They're lining them all up.

306
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,160
They're being herded like animals.

307
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:07,096
Unfortunately, he has the right
to choose the ones he wants.

308
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:08,702
And if Uncle Tom is chosen?

309
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,123
I've been talking to Uncle Tom.

310
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:11,293
He has to be one of the
people who...

311
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,514
The sheriff.

312
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,617
I'm sure it'll serve its purpose.

313
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,272
You're free, Eliza.

314
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,717
I always felt like I was free
with you folks, Miss Shelby.

315
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,301
That's not the way they do things

316
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,020
in the world outside now, Eliza.

317
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,963
And don't forget, for little Harry,

318
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,107
this document I gave you is useless.

319
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:29,008
You have to be very careful.

320
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:31,407
He belongs to Mr. Legree
in the eyes of the law.

321
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:34,105
You could be accused of
kidnapping your own child.

322
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,413
I haven't much money.

323
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,114
Here, Eliza.

324
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,611
Here, here's $20.
- Oh, no.

325
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,937
I saved every cent of
the money you gave me.

326
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,406
I don't need anymore.
- Go on, take the money,

327
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,222
Eliza, you're sure to need
it before you're through.

328
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:49,215
Tell old Jim to harness the
fastest horse in the stable.

329
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,808
Just leave him at the ferry.

330
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,105
How can I ever thank you?

331
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:56,105
Write me when you've
found your husband and you're safe.

332
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,462
And now you better hurry up.

333
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,931
Mr. Legree's a very dangerous man.

334
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:10,004
Go on, get in the wagon.

335
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,717
Sit here.

336
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,018
Gimme your ankle.

337
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:22,414
Number eight.

338
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:24,413
Get in the wagon.

339
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:40,717
Nine.

340
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:41,811
Over here.

341
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:43,303
Where's number 10?

342
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:44,905
Get in.

343
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,108
Who's that, sir?

344
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,046
The child, the maid's little boy.

345
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,513
What's her name, Eliza?

346
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,325
We've been looking for them.

347
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,604
Nobody's seen her or the boy, sir.

348
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:55,116
Where's the child?

349
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,311
Eliza and the child are both gone.

350
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,710
We've looked over the whole plantation.

351
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,053
Where have they gone?

352
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,608
You could ask Mrs. Shelby.

353
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,217
Eliza belongs to her.

354
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,354
It's important.

355
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:14,324
I don't understand
how you can ask me to.

356
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:17,412
I was under the impression
I was dealing with a gentleman.

357
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:19,013
What do you mean by that, sir?

358
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,608
The child Harry's vanished.

359
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:23,319
The terms of our agreement
gave me the right.

360
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,596
He's undoubtedly with his mother.
- And where's the mother?

361
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:28,217
Someplace in the woods,
I should think.

362
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:30,022
In the woods?

363
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,303
Woods, yes.

364
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,519
At least, I think that's where she is.

365
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,913
She's gathering mushrooms.

366
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,420
Where is the boy?

367
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:43,221
That, you must ask
his mother, I'm afraid.

368
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:46,822
You helped them to escape, of course.

369
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,198
Sir, how dare you address my wife

370
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,532
in that tone of voice!
- Do you think I'm so easily fooled?

371
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,208
Mr. Legree!
- Let me tell you this...

372
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:53,278
I give you my word of honor, sir.

373
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,309
I have no idea where those two have gone.

374
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:56,708
I'm not impressed.

375
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,563
What about horses, have you horses ready?

376
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:02,008
We'll be glad to arrange
for horses, Mr. Legree.

377
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:02,601
Thank you.

378
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:04,255
And you want the
horses saddled for you

379
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,008
right after you finish dinner?

380
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,016
No, thanks, before dinner.

381
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:10,098
If that man ever comes
into my house again...

382
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,518
Give him the oldest,
slowest ones we have.

383
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,809
Nice, slow ones.

384
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,809
Which way we go now?

385
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,216
That's a better road,
but this one's shorter.

386
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:38,615
You go that way!

387
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:43,717
Here, take us across.

388
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,273
We've got to cross right away.

389
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:47,415
Impossible, the ferry's not running.

390
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,704
Well, isn't there some other boat then?

391
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,310
The river's full of ice.

392
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,023
You can't get across.

393
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,318
But I must.

394
00:24:57,494 --> 00:24:58,724
You're mad!

395
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,904
Stay here, you can't get across there!

396
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,225
Seen anybody come by here?

397
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:29,267
Nobody.

398
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,624
What's this wagon here?

399
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,811
Must've come unhitched somewhere.

400
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,427
Are you out of your mind?

401
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:15,908
She's not my property.

402
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,510
But they're getting away.

403
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,287
If you kill her it'll cost me $1,000,

404
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:20,809
and you'll be a murderer.

405
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,595
Yes, but, Mr. Legree, I thought...

406
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,408
Think with what, you idiot?

407
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,510
Come on, your black brothers
are there waiting for you.

408
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,205
If you're black, nothing
you do for him is right.

409
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:02,907
Hold it.

410
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,210
He's gonna go right on
hitting you if you don't talk.

411
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:09,507
You better tell me where that
no-good brother of yours is.

412
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:12,316
Hello, Morrison.

413
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,350
I've come to fetch Harris.
You can put him in there.

414
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,315
No, I can't, he's run away.

415
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,823
You must be joking!

416
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,213
I wish I was.

417
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,713
I've got his sister there, though.

418
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,518
I'll beat it out of her where he is.
- His sister?

419
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:28,615
And I had my troubles today
with his wife and son.

420
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:32,412
I might just as well see what the rest
of the family looks like.

421
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,902
She's a pretty one.
What's her name?

422
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,004
Casey.

423
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,316
Pretty name, Casey.

424
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:51,625
How'd you like to come with
me in place of your brother?

425
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,906
Know how to cook?

426
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,817
Good, I'll take her with me.

427
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,356
You got the best of our deal, Morrison.
You're getting off easy.

428
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:06,106
Well, what's a few
dollars between old friends?

429
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:08,012
Have a good trip.

430
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,512
Get out, get out, come on.

431
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,006
All right, get in line.

432
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,317
Come on, old man.
You, too.

433
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,019
Come.

434
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:22,924
Go on, gal.

435
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:25,205
Get going down there.

436
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,995
Go on!
- Poor Casey.

437
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:28,916
Shut your mouth, go on.

438
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,101
Good day, Mr. Legree.

439
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,118
Come on, get a move on.

440
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:48,633
Boat won't wait for you.

441
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,587
Captain, nearly ready, sir.

442
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,016
Take the lap first.
We'll hit the currents on our way.

443
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,610
Aye aye, sir.
- Carry on.

444
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:03,508
Hurry up with that loading, there!

445
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,102
Look out for the lambs there.

446
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,813
Come on, old man, stop gawking.

447
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,212
Get a move on.

448
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:19,025
Why do they put all those
men in chains, father?

449
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,409
Are they criminals?

450
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:22,814
No, it's not that.

451
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,923
They're slaves and their
owners have chained them.

452
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,224
But why must they be chained?

453
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,617
Well, because some owners
are wicked and cruel.

454
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:33,912
Come, come.

455
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,609
Hurry up, keep moving.

456
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,426
Don't fall asleep there,
you can sleep later.

457
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,818
Go on, move, hurry up!

458
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,310
Get in there.

459
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:12,208
How do you like it here?

460
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:14,216
Here.

461
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:17,509
Actually, I bought these
things for Lucinda.

462
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,659
She's the singer in my hotel,

463
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,109
but you're much younger and prettier.

464
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,985
There, choose what you like.

465
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,109
It's all yours.

466
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,097
Take a look in the mirror.

467
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:32,912
Here's something else.

468
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,211
Wanna smell it?

469
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:36,812
How do you like it?

470
00:31:41,604 --> 00:31:43,213
Smells good, huh?

471
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,713
If you like, I'll make
a real lady out of you.

472
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:55,006
How can you make a real lady out of me?

473
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:56,519
I'm a negress.

474
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,409
Leave that to me.

475
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:03,000
What I say decides who's
a nigger and who isn't.

476
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,217
You, sit over there where you belong.

477
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,345
This man gave you
money for clothes for us.

478
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,756
What'd you do, drink it?

479
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:35,612
Mr. Legree got all kind
of clothes on the plantation

480
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,612
off all the slaves that died.

481
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:39,815
Get out, what is this a funeral?

482
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,120
What do you think they're all
saying about you up there?

483
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,026
If you behave yourselves,
you'll be treated well,

484
00:32:45,077 --> 00:32:46,703
and, if not, look out.

485
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,716
Do we understand each other?

486
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:49,912
Well, answer.

487
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,506
Yes, sir.
- All right.

488
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,160
Now, let's hear you sing a song.

489
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:55,271
Sing whatever you want to,

490
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:57,326
sing one of those spirituals.

491
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:58,412
All right?

492
00:32:58,487 --> 00:32:59,810
Why don't you sing?

493
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:02,404
Sing, I said.

494
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:22,795
Excuse me.

495
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,713
Did y'all like it, Miss?

496
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:07,120
Yes, your singing was very beautiful.

497
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,112
Why must you wear these?

498
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,104
So we don't run away.

499
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:12,573
Well, I think it's awful.

500
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:14,713
Oh, that's how things is, child.

501
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,886
You better go now, before
you get some trouble

502
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:18,146
for coming down here.

503
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,812
Will you let me visit you again?

504
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:21,414
If your mother says you can.

505
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:24,422
Oh, she's at home, but my
father lets me do anything.

506
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,625
Does he?

507
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:27,938
Oh, I'm glad you came, Father.

508
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,918
Please, break off these chains.

509
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,012
I can't do that, dear,
I'm not their owner.

510
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,207
Who is?

511
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:36,406
First, my Lord, then Mr. Legree.

512
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:38,012
Well, I'll talk with the Lord.

513
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,701
And my father will speak
to Mr. Legree.

514
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,115
My name's Evangeline.

515
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:48,708
But they all call me Eva.

516
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:50,935
And I'm Thomas, but
they calls me Uncle Tom.

517
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,107
You must call me Uncle Tom, too.

518
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,349
All right, Uncle Tom.

519
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,310
I'm going, but I'll see you
again tomorrow. Bye.

520
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:58,928
Good day.

521
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,432
Excuse me, sir.

522
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:11,216
Do you own those people downstairs?

523
00:36:11,897 --> 00:36:13,732
I own them, yes.

524
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,936
Why must you eat alone?

525
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:17,908
I prefer to eat alone.

526
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:19,408
It gives me time to...

527
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,412
I must ask you to forgive her
for disturbing you, sir, but...

528
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:23,611
Not at all.

529
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:24,745
It was a great pleasure to make

530
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,119
your daughter's acquaintance,
Mr. Saint-Claire.

531
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,400
You know my name.

532
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,595
Yes, we're practically neighbors.

533
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,626
I own a plantation down in the Bottoms

534
00:36:32,677 --> 00:36:34,714
and then, some time ago,
I bought the tavern,

535
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:36,619
so I know most of the townspeople,

536
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,797
by sight, at least.

537
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:42,925
If there's any way that I can
be of any service to you...

538
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:45,605
No, thank you. I don't think
there's any likelihood of

539
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,925
the occasion arising for
us to do business together.

540
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:51,495
But, Father, you
could do business with him.

541
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:53,816
You can buy all those slaves
and take off their chains.

542
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:57,117
Sorry, dear, you see, I can't buy
all the slaves in the world, even for you.

543
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:58,585
But at least buy Uncle Tom.

544
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:59,718
Excuse us.

545
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,404
Brought this food for you.

546
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:23,717
Here.
Tomorrow, I'll eat with you in the cabin.

547
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,077
Looks like the fine, respectable people

548
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,608
on board this boat don't
exactly approve of me.

549
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,210
You know why they don't?

550
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:35,905
Because of you!

551
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:41,616
Did you hear what I said,
did you understand me?

552
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:45,868
Answer me when I'm talking to you!

553
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:48,515
Folks here don't like
you, and it's my fault.

554
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,409
That's better.

555
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:56,921
How come you didn't put these on?

556
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:01,803
Aren't they good enough for you
or are they too good?

557
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:06,917
Take off those rags.

558
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:19,315
Casey,

559
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:21,908
take that thing off.

560
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,711
Do as I tell you.

561
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:26,010
Drink.

562
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:11,011
Didn't you like our song this morning?

563
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:13,812
No, because this time
it's a goodbye song.

564
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,812
I'll think of you when I
sings that song, Miss Eva.

565
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:17,957
And when I do, you'll feel it,

566
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,808
and then our thoughts
will be together again.

567
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,418
But I'd like to keep
you with me all the time.

568
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:25,018
And then maybe you could
be happy again, Uncle Tom.

569
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,015
I've felt very happy
while we's on the river

570
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:31,398
In the morning, when
it's time to get off,

571
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,957
Mr. Legree will put you
all back in chains again,

572
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,605
and it makes me even sadder.

573
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,816
Oh, Uncle Tom!

574
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,519
Why aren't you eating?

575
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,016
Go ahead and eat.

576
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:42,810
Your friends won't starve.

577
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,326
That would be foolish.

578
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:48,131
You can't get any work out
of them if they're not fed.

579
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:52,306
Ah, well, young lady,
what brings you here?

580
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:55,019
Is this Mrs. Legree?

581
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:58,210
Well, suppose she is, what then?

582
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:00,025
Then I would like something from her.

583
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:02,908
Please, would you give me
Uncle Tom as a present?

584
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,716
Ah, Uncle Tom.

585
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:07,310
Can I have him then?

586
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,816
A present?

587
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:10,617
No, I'm afraid not.

588
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,512
Can I buy him from you?

589
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,416
You couldn't pay
what Uncle Tom is worth.

590
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,611
Why don't you?

591
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:17,908
You know he's a very old man.

592
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,912
He won't be much good on the plantation.

593
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:22,026
You don't know what
you're talking about.

594
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:26,312
He may be old, but he's strong as an ox.

595
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:27,724
Uncle Tom isn't an ox.

596
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:29,607
Besides, he made me a baby doll.

597
00:41:29,662 --> 00:41:31,255
Man overboard, Napoleon.

598
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:33,212
Accident?
- No, he jumped.

599
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,618
Whatever is the matter?

600
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:15,012
Leave me alone.

601
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:17,509
But your leg, it's wounded.

602
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:19,905
I don't need nobody help.

603
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,613
You can't stay here, it isn't safe.

604
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:24,413
No.

605
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,316
Then you'll die.

606
00:44:29,697 --> 00:44:31,409
Don't need nobody help.

607
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:35,226
Don't need nobody help.

608
00:44:42,602 --> 00:44:43,711
Wait.

609
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:45,508
Please.

610
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,305
Giddy-up.

611
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:00,904
Gotta get away from here.

612
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,420
Gotta get away!

613
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,320
Gotta get away!

614
00:46:13,096 --> 00:46:14,299
Away from here.

615
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:55,419
Sit there.

616
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:58,005
Well, come on.

617
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:14,909
What you looking at, boy?

618
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:17,034
Find out what the lady wants.
Bring me a beer.

619
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:18,511
Nothing, thank you.

620
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:20,613
Why don't you want a drink?

621
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,113
Cause they're all staring at you?

622
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:24,308
Does it annoy you?
It doesn't bother me a bit.

623
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:25,437
Then why aren't you drinking?

624
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:27,312
I wanna get that dress, I told you.

625
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:28,921
Haven't you got enough already?

626
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:31,616
Did you promise it to me or didn't you?

627
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:35,612
There.

628
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:37,909
But hurry.
- Thank you.

629
00:50:42,297 --> 00:50:44,011
There she is again!

630
00:50:44,406 --> 00:50:46,718
Dressed up like a circus horse.

631
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,416
Excuse me.

632
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,612
Henry!

633
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:00,002
Legree's got his nerve, ain't he?

634
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:02,186
Well, I'll say one thing for him,

635
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:05,010
he sure picked a pretty one.

636
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,030
Where is she?

637
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,401
Casey, you're here.

638
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:30,807
I came as soon as I could.

639
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:32,315
Were you worried?

640
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,100
Lonesome mostly.

641
00:51:34,151 --> 00:51:35,464
I've good news for you.

642
00:51:35,515 --> 00:51:36,740
Harris sent word he's coming.

643
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:37,749
He is?

644
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,550
Eliza, he's free, and Mr. Wilson

645
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:41,611
has paid him for that invention.

646
00:51:42,204 --> 00:51:45,719
Harris knows then, about you
taking his place and being here?

647
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,571
Yes, he does, now you can't stay here.

648
00:51:47,622 --> 00:51:49,114
Where else is there?

649
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,445
Somewhere that Simon
Legree would never dream

650
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:52,805
that you were hiding,

651
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:55,411
with him, in the same house.

652
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:58,411
He'll never look for you
there, that's for sure.

653
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:00,318
All right?

654
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:02,661
And I'll come back in a
couple of days to get you.

655
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:04,558
Oh, Casey!
- Everything's gonna be

656
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:07,144
all right now, Eliza, you'll see.

657
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:13,715
It happened about two years ago.

658
00:52:14,106 --> 00:52:17,515
Poor Jed got caught in one of
them freak lightning storms.

659
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:21,201
I wouldn't believe he was dead at first.

660
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:26,222
Then after a while, I just felt nothing.

661
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,075
So I took this job teaching,

662
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:33,306
and I've been living in this big house
all alone ever since.

663
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:35,916
What about you?

664
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,818
Where'd you get the name Napoleon?

665
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:42,212
I'll bet I know.

666
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,717
Your ma wanted you to
be important someday,

667
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,615
so she named you after a famous general.

668
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,469
A man as big and strong as you

669
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,611
will get to be important someday, I know,

670
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:59,514
especially reading and writing
the way your friend Tom taught you.

671
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:04,014
My leg's getting better now.

672
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:06,924
I gotta be going.

673
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:11,206
They're gonna be looking
everywhere for me.

674
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,510
You can stay, they won't look here.

675
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,678
Simon Legree's men were
in town the other day,

676
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:19,909
and I heard one of them
say you must've gone north.

677
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,907
They won't find you here.

678
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:24,818
I'm a slave.

679
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,014
I belong to Legree.

680
00:53:29,897 --> 00:53:32,706
I don't know why you're
taking these chances, but...

681
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:35,623
I don't want anything
to happen to you,

682
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,217
not on account of me.

683
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:40,712
But I don't want you to go.

684
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:46,494
You're the first good
thing that's happened to me

685
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:48,112
in an awful long time.

686
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:51,517
With you here, I find myself smiling,

687
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:56,017
listening for the birds,
watching the flowers,

688
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,176
becoming aware of all the beauty in life

689
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:04,504
instead of that ugly,
dreary existence I had.

690
00:54:05,803 --> 00:54:08,417
Please, stay.

691
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,221
Tell me you feel something for me, too.

692
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:15,604
Ma'am?

693
00:54:18,198 --> 00:54:19,814
My name is Melissa.

694
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,519
Say it.

695
00:54:25,104 --> 00:54:26,206
Melissa.

696
00:54:27,704 --> 00:54:28,905
Melissa.

697
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:31,311
That wasn't so hard, was it?

698
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:35,210
Melissa.

699
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:37,914
You're a kind person.

700
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:43,420
I got feelings for you like
I ain't never had before.

701
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:47,109
But they's wrong.

702
00:54:48,796 --> 00:54:51,701
You're white and I'm black,

703
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:54,602
and they won't let us have these feelings.

704
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:57,308
It don't matter none what we want.

705
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:00,214
Why can't they leave people be?

706
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:02,674
It isn't fair!

707
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,315
Everyone should be equal.

708
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,807
There shouldn't be this color barrier.

709
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:10,108
Why won't they let us live in peace?

710
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,112
Napoleon...

711
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,519
I need you.

712
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:18,923
I need you to hold me,

713
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:22,822
to need me,

714
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:25,515
to love me.

715
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:40,310
I don't care about anyone else.

716
00:58:09,697 --> 00:58:10,806
Napoleon?

717
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:24,324
Are you all right?

718
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:29,428
I don't know what I'd do if
anything happened to you.

719
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,822
I had a beautiful dream.

720
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:36,622
We were in Paris, and
everybody accepted us.

721
00:58:36,673 --> 00:58:38,317
Wasn't no color barrier.

722
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:41,320
We were so happy and peaceful.

723
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:45,913
No one to bother us.

724
00:58:48,906 --> 00:58:50,412
Maybe it could happen.

725
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:52,717
Maybe.

726
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,922
Napoleon, tell me it could happen.

727
00:58:56,997 --> 00:58:58,512
I'm so scared.

728
00:59:57,811 --> 00:59:59,913
Dear, Miss Melissa.

729
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:05,604
Sometimes I don't say things
too well, but I will try.

730
01:00:06,908 --> 01:00:11,209
I guess I love you cause, I don't know,

731
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,021
I never loved anyone before,

732
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:16,014
except my ma and pa.

733
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:19,637
You are the nicest
person I have ever known.

734
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:23,215
Maybe someday your dream will come true.

735
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:24,913
I hope so.

736
01:00:25,713 --> 01:00:28,320
But right now, I can
only bring you trouble,

737
01:00:28,904 --> 01:00:31,404
and I don't ever want to hurt you.

738
01:00:32,806 --> 01:00:35,027
I hope you will find happiness,

739
01:00:35,595 --> 01:00:38,422
and that you will think of me always.

740
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:40,525
I know...

741
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:43,619
I will never forget you.

742
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:47,217
Love, Napoleon.

743
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,406
Well, looky here.

744
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,910
If it ain't my old friend Napoleon.

745
01:01:01,097 --> 01:01:02,705
Where you been, boy?

746
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:05,116
Here, boys.

747
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:10,210
I want you to meet Mr.
Legree's fucking nigger.

748
01:01:24,996 --> 01:01:27,621
That ought to teach you, boy.

749
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,852
Want us to cut his balls off?

750
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:34,313
Nah, Mr. Legree wants
to make an example of him.

751
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:38,424
Too many of them other niggers
thinking about escaping.

752
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,610
We gonna do something
real special to this one.

753
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:46,313
This motherfucker cunt, he's gonna pay.

754
01:01:46,998 --> 01:01:48,918
If we ain't a-gonna kill him,

755
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:51,813
maybe we can have a little fun first.

756
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,918
I ain't said we ain't gonna kill him.

757
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:57,129
We just gonna make it interesting.

758
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,820
Now, you boys can have
all the fun you want,

759
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:02,573
but for your sake, I just hope

760
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:04,813
you don't catch nothing from this nigger.

761
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:08,012
Couldn't be nothing worse
than we got from those sheep.

762
01:02:35,903 --> 01:02:39,004
Shit, that tar's blacker
than the nigger.

763
01:02:42,203 --> 01:02:44,914
Well, it looks like
the soup's about ready.

764
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,818
I ain't never seen
nothing like that before.

765
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,004
I heard about it once.

766
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:53,113
Tore the skin right off,
just like being burnt alive.

767
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:04,118
Well, boy, how you feel now?

768
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:07,520
You know, I was always your friend,

769
01:03:08,102 --> 01:03:10,312
and as long as you done your work,

770
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:12,018
I ain't never hit you much.

771
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:14,516
Tell Legree to fuck himself!

772
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:19,809
That wasn't nice, boy.

773
01:03:21,003 --> 01:03:23,902
Now I guess we gotta do what we gotta do.

774
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:41,717
Don't pass out now, boy.

775
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:43,913
The best is yet to come.

776
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,610
Fuck you!

777
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:11,114
Crown the nigger boy.

778
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,204
He's coming, he
mustn't find out I've been away.

779
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:54,950
I know you doesn't cry, Harry.

780
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:58,013
What if he does, Casey,
what if somebody should come?

781
01:04:58,064 --> 01:04:59,318
Here, take this.

782
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,310
Now, honey, you be quiet, hear?

783
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,743
Don't worry, nobody can get up here.

784
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:05,418
I took care of that.

785
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,211
10 new hands.

786
01:06:02,285 --> 01:06:05,613
These ought a stop your complaints
about being so shorthanded.

787
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:08,312
Yes, sir, only yesterday,
we lost three more.

788
01:06:08,383 --> 01:06:11,078
I guess they were so scared, hearing
the hounds coming after them,

789
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:12,573
that they ran for the swampy ground.

790
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:15,209
Idiot, we'll speak about this later.

791
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,427
I hope you all heard.

792
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:19,805
None of the three who tried it escaped.

793
01:06:20,404 --> 01:06:22,122
Here, nobody gets away.

794
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:26,829
This isn't a showplace like
Saint-Claire's was, is it?

795
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:30,005
Go ahead and complain if you want.

796
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,020
Course, nobody will listen.

797
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:35,926
You can be as happy as
you like, it's your right.

798
01:06:36,403 --> 01:06:37,809
Your only right.

799
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:53,425
Should I shut them up for you, boss?

800
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:55,213
No.

801
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:58,220
Don't you like music?

802
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:13,613
What brings you two here?

803
01:08:13,707 --> 01:08:15,112
That man leading the singing,

804
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,207
didn't he belong to Pierre Saint-Claire?

805
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:33,490
I gotta have tea.
- Sambo, shut them up

806
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:35,416
and bed them down for the night.

807
01:08:35,467 --> 01:08:37,017
Right, boss.
- Go ahead.

808
01:08:37,603 --> 01:08:39,314
He could cause trouble you know.

809
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,521
He's always caused some trouble,

810
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:51,121
but what can he do out here?

811
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:53,423
I like the singing, it's pleasant.
Sit down.

812
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:55,011
What if he escapes?

813
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,511
Nobody's gotten away
from here alive yet.

814
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:00,116
John here hasn't been that lucky.

815
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:02,030
Last night, 15 got away.

816
01:09:02,081 --> 01:09:03,237
And right before picking time!

817
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:05,304
Don't you have dogs and guards?

818
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:06,358
Sure.

819
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:07,749
We got back four of them.

820
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:08,727
And the rest?

821
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,905
They're hiding in the monastery.

822
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:14,046
About time we burned a
couple of their sheds again.

823
01:09:14,097 --> 01:09:15,530
Seems they need another lesson.

824
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:17,911
The situation since then
has changed considerable.

825
01:09:17,962 --> 01:09:20,010
The monks are getting help from the north.

826
01:09:20,596 --> 01:09:21,716
Getting help?

827
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:23,514
Abolitionists.

828
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:27,917
And most of them are the
ones folks call Quakers.

829
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:29,112
Lot of do-gooders.

830
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:30,915
I seen them in Ohio.

831
01:09:31,307 --> 01:09:32,514
Even so.

832
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:35,907
They can shoot.
- What?

833
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:37,314
Rabbits, huh?

834
01:09:37,392 --> 01:09:39,915
They're peaceable, don't
hold with war or killing,

835
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,673
but some of them will kill when it comes

836
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:44,817
to defending something,
like right or justice.

837
01:09:44,888 --> 01:09:46,620
Right, justice, what are they?

838
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:48,618
Words, just words, that's all.

839
01:09:48,704 --> 01:09:50,407
I'd think things over.

840
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,009
An evening full of surprises.

841
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,023
What's the occasion, come in.

842
01:09:55,402 --> 01:09:56,915
Read it yourself.

843
01:09:57,107 --> 01:09:58,632
What, about the
committee they're sending?

844
01:09:58,683 --> 01:09:59,724
We know that.

845
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,216
You don't know nothing.

846
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:04,317
Lincoln has won, he's gonna be president.

847
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:06,226
This some kind of joke?

848
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:08,802
By a slim majority, but he won.

849
01:10:08,911 --> 01:10:11,353
Well, gentlemen, now what?

850
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,830
Succession, what else?

851
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:15,733
Lincoln will keep his campaign promises

852
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:17,536
and free the slaves.

853
01:10:17,603 --> 01:10:20,829
It'll give him five
million more supporters.

854
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:24,710
It's going to cost us dearly, gentlemen.

855
01:10:24,765 --> 01:10:26,710
Not my slaves, Mr. Lincoln.

856
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:37,523
Were you delighted to hear the news

857
01:10:37,796 --> 01:10:39,812
that the gentlemen brought from town?

858
01:10:39,863 --> 01:10:41,414
What news is that?

859
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:44,410
You're not going to say
you didn't listen, are you?

860
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:46,711
I was in the pantry getting whisky.

861
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:48,432
I must've missed it.

862
01:10:49,406 --> 01:10:51,218
Seems they had a
couple of runaway niggers

863
01:10:51,269 --> 01:10:53,604
and they're scared to death.
- And you?

864
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,308
Are you scared?

865
01:10:57,707 --> 01:11:00,323
My niggers are more afraid
of me than I am of them.

866
01:11:00,392 --> 01:11:03,103
Here, brought you a little present.

867
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,522
You can at least say
thanks to me, couldn't you?

868
01:11:10,573 --> 01:11:12,116
I thank you.

869
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:13,811
Nice necklace.

870
01:11:16,998 --> 01:11:19,421
You could even strangle somebody with it.

871
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,508
And lose the $1,000 you paid for me?

872
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:24,616
Extravagant, huh?

873
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:28,612
But that's the way I am.

874
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:46,504
Harris!

875
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:02,222
Was Legree there?
- No.

876
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,113
Did you see my wife and child?

877
01:12:05,703 --> 01:12:07,114
No, only your sister.

878
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:09,414
Have you told her about
the ship we've chartered?

879
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:11,109
It won't be able to wait for her.

880
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:13,001
She knows, yes.

881
01:12:13,214 --> 01:12:16,113
And she knows I'll pay any
price this brute asks for her.

882
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:18,230
I don't think money
will induce Mr. Legree

883
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:19,799
to give up your sister.

884
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:25,311
If I know Mr. Legree, he will all right.

885
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:32,318
I've been waiting for you.

886
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,805
He says he saw you with someone.

887
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:44,612
Who was it?

888
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:48,018
He says he saw him come
in but he didn't leave.

889
01:12:48,103 --> 01:12:49,604
He's lying.

890
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,221
You hear her?

891
01:12:53,316 --> 01:12:54,518
You're lying!

892
01:12:54,596 --> 01:12:55,807
Get outta here.

893
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:06,619
Give me your hand.

894
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:11,209
Now who's the man?

895
01:13:11,271 --> 01:13:13,084
Where'd you hide him?
- What man?

896
01:13:13,146 --> 01:13:15,303
Is he here, in my house?
Answer me!

897
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:17,248
Oh, my arm, you're breaking it.

898
01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:19,404
I'll break your neck
if you don't answer.

899
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,638
Up in...
- Where is he?

900
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,115
Up in the barn in the attic.

901
01:13:41,203 --> 01:13:42,997
Keep an eye on her, Sambo.

902
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:44,406
Yes, boss.

903
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,009
Where are you at, boss?

904
01:15:34,603 --> 01:15:35,807
I'm coming.

905
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:59,409
Some of the boards are rotten up there.

906
01:15:59,503 --> 01:16:01,511
They better be replaced.

907
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,199
Sambo, see to it.

908
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:07,026
Why do you look so concerned?
Nothing happened, you see.

909
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:08,807
A miss is as good as a mile.

910
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:12,622
I must say, that is quite a trick.

911
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,016
Black witch!

912
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:19,516
You really wanted to do me in, didn't you?

913
01:16:19,696 --> 01:16:21,907
I'm sorry I couldn't oblige.

914
01:16:23,206 --> 01:16:26,120
From now on, you're gonna be
out in the fields, working.

915
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:27,878
Sambo, do you hear?

916
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:30,612
Tomorrow morning, put
her to work in the fields

917
01:16:30,675 --> 01:16:32,909
in that dress she's wearing now.

918
01:16:32,972 --> 01:16:34,611
Bunk her with the others.

919
01:18:02,597 --> 01:18:04,511
Basil.
- Evening, sir.

920
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:08,308
Well, you been thinking?

921
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:13,501
Don't you think it's better
with me, in my house?

922
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:46,513
Casey!

923
01:18:47,395 --> 01:18:48,513
Move!

924
01:18:50,106 --> 01:18:51,212
Tom!

925
01:19:02,096 --> 01:19:03,615
There's a saying

926
01:19:04,503 --> 01:19:06,409
I remember hearing once.

927
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,315
I never...

928
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:11,815
understood it before.

929
01:19:13,105 --> 01:19:16,715
It's very, very important.
- Don't try to speak, Uncle Tom.

930
01:19:17,402 --> 01:19:19,215
I must tell you, Casey.

931
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:22,809
I must tell you.

932
01:19:23,309 --> 01:19:26,297
I haven't very

933
01:19:28,398 --> 01:19:29,811
much longer.

934
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:35,305
The saying is, God helps those

935
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:39,418
who help themselves.

936
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:43,907
Only one thing wrong, that's
a saying for white people.

937
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,102
No.

938
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:51,615
Listen to me,

939
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:55,597
God sees black and white the same.

940
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:57,315
He will help you.

941
01:19:57,503 --> 01:19:59,524
You must run away.

942
01:20:01,104 --> 01:20:02,112
Yeah?

943
01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:08,709
Mr. Legree?

944
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,031
Yeah, I'm Legree, but who are you?

945
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:12,616
You don't remember me?

946
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:14,014
I'm sorry, no.

947
01:20:14,813 --> 01:20:16,826
I owe you some money, Mr. Legree.

948
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:18,311
A debt?

949
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,211
Come in, excuse us.

950
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:22,721
What debt?

951
01:20:23,002 --> 01:20:25,112
It concerns my sister, Casey.

952
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:28,205
You took her from Mr.
Morrison in my place,

953
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:32,307
and my little son Harry, who you
forced Mr. Shelby to sell to you.

954
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,135
You've changed a bit since then.

955
01:20:35,186 --> 01:20:37,209
Nobody would recognize you.
What do you want?

956
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,459
I invented a machine
that does in one day

957
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:41,256
what 1,000 slaves do in a week,

958
01:20:41,307 --> 01:20:43,412
and it does it much better,

959
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,820
and I bought my freedom from Mr. Morrison.

960
01:20:45,873 --> 01:20:48,350
Mr. Wilson paid me a lot
for my invention. I'm rich.

961
01:20:48,404 --> 01:20:50,908
As well as free now, Mr. Legree.

962
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:52,615
Very interesting.

963
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:54,717
Then you're free to get outta here.
Go on.

964
01:20:55,001 --> 01:20:56,318
Name the price

965
01:20:56,404 --> 01:20:58,318
for my child and my sister.

966
01:20:58,369 --> 01:21:00,920
I haven't got the boy
and Casey's not for sale.

967
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,115
If you haven't got the
child, so much the better.

968
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:07,299
I'll pay you whatever
you ask for him anyway,

969
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:08,807
and for Casey.

970
01:21:08,908 --> 01:21:10,213
She wants to stay with me.

971
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:11,705
I'll not give her up.

972
01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:15,016
You don't even believe
that yourself, Legree.

973
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:16,643
Mr. Legree, Harris.

974
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:19,534
I'm busy, get out.
- You listen to me, Mr. Legree!

975
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:21,100
If I don't get...
- Just a minute, please.

976
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:24,307
I'm sure we can discuss this
matter without violence.

977
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,916
I'm willing to be reasonable about this,

978
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:29,117
and I need more cash right now.

979
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:31,825
We can talk this thing
over like gentlemen should.

980
01:21:32,412 --> 01:21:34,807
Who's the one let this
fancy nigger in here?

981
01:21:35,096 --> 01:21:36,299
Carl, Henry.

982
01:21:39,703 --> 01:21:42,703
Get outta here.
- Let go of me!

983
01:21:43,406 --> 01:21:45,422
Come on, get outta here.

984
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:53,215
Here's your hat!

985
01:21:59,704 --> 01:22:03,398
No, sir, I don't want
any fancy, play niggers

986
01:22:03,454 --> 01:22:05,813
strutting around any place where I come.

987
01:22:05,868 --> 01:22:07,579
We keep them in their
place and their place

988
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,612
ain't in here with decent folks.

989
01:22:09,681 --> 01:22:12,632
And just who are you to
decide who comes in here?

990
01:22:13,006 --> 01:22:14,806
I belong here and they don't,

991
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:17,094
and that's why...
- Are you better than they are?

992
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,413
Better than they are, and
better than any white nigger.

993
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:38,346
Stop, hold it!

994
01:22:38,397 --> 01:22:41,405
My niggers are running
away, could be yours next!

995
01:22:41,468 --> 01:22:42,811
This concerns us all.

996
01:22:42,866 --> 01:22:44,804
I count on everybody to help.

997
01:23:37,502 --> 01:23:40,627
Come, Eliza, we have to get Uncle Tom.
Come.

998
01:23:50,502 --> 01:23:51,604
Uncle Tom?

999
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:54,414
Come, Uncle Tom.

1000
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:57,917
Hold on to me.

1001
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:00,628
We have a long road ahead of us.

1002
01:24:01,799 --> 01:24:02,901
No.

1003
01:24:03,409 --> 01:24:07,107
I'm going on a different road.

1004
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:11,726
My road is a long one,

1005
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:16,698
and I must go all the way

1006
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:19,534
by myself.

1007
01:24:22,002 --> 01:24:25,510
At the end, I'll be free.

1008
01:24:25,698 --> 01:24:28,416
And now you must go, Casey, go.

1009
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,117
Goodbye, Uncle Tom.

1010
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,817
Come on!
- Hurry up!

1011
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,712
Hurry up, get over there!

1012
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:49,897
Push it, push it!

1013
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:53,109
That's it.

1014
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:18,008
Come on!

1015
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:47,118
Open the gates.

1016
01:25:47,296 --> 01:25:49,219
Help me, please.

1017
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,024
Thank you.

1018
01:25:51,204 --> 01:25:53,424
Hurry, they have wounded.

1019
01:25:53,602 --> 01:25:54,609
Quickly.

1020
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,215
Get them inside.

1021
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,521
Gently.

1022
01:25:59,601 --> 01:26:01,078
You have to go right now.

1023
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:03,109
And your family, what about them?

1024
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:07,920
You'll have to go without
them if they're not here.

1025
01:26:08,201 --> 01:26:10,014
These men can't wait.

1026
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:11,418
The ship...

1027
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,509
is ready.

1028
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:20,315
Boss, this way.

1029
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:21,712
They've been spotted.

1030
01:26:21,798 --> 01:26:22,915
Come on, let's go.

1031
01:26:23,009 --> 01:26:23,821
You sure?

1032
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:25,962
Yes sir, Casey and
another woman on the road.

1033
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:27,286
Casey?
- Yes, sir.

1034
01:26:27,337 --> 01:26:29,310
Which way they going?
- Over toward the monastery.

1035
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:31,325
That where the others are heading, too.

1036
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:34,211
Come on, let's go.
I think those brothers need a lesson.

1037
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,812
Faster, faster!

1038
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:52,011
They're closer.

1039
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,825
We're gaining on them!

1040
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:00,911
Faster!

1041
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,226
Eliza, Casey!

1042
01:27:09,277 --> 01:27:10,316
Eliza!

1043
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:13,123
Is the boy all right?

1044
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:14,917
Casey, take him, please.
- Sure.

1045
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:17,315
It's all right, honey,

1046
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,998
You'll be all right, my darling.

1047
01:27:24,099 --> 01:27:25,126
You're safe now.

1048
01:27:25,177 --> 01:27:26,817
You better hurry.
They're nearly on us

1049
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:28,223
Close the gates.

1050
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:35,718
No one can harm you here.

1051
01:27:36,603 --> 01:27:38,397
You'll be all right now.

1052
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:39,931
You're safe.

1053
01:27:40,998 --> 01:27:42,100
All of you.

1054
01:27:42,175 --> 01:27:46,506
And my son, my son, he's
gonna be free, Eliza!

1055
01:27:46,592 --> 01:27:48,201
He'll be free!

1056
01:27:56,999 --> 01:27:58,709
They've run to ground.

1057
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:01,217
Let's smoke them out like varmints.

1058
01:28:01,268 --> 01:28:02,710
What about it, boss?

1059
01:28:02,897 --> 01:28:05,014
Yeah, go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

1060
01:28:05,803 --> 01:28:09,109
Let's go!
- We'll get them outta there!

1061
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,506
Stay here.
- I'm coming, too.

1062
01:28:15,301 --> 01:28:17,121
Come then.
- All right, darling.

1063
01:28:17,309 --> 01:28:19,117
There's gonna be fireworks!
- Here you are.

1064
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,676
Come on, I'll cook them there.

1065
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,223
You said it, let's go.

1066
01:28:51,002 --> 01:28:54,017
Casey, oh, Casey.

1067
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:04,715
Let's hope they
honor this white flag.

1068
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,606
Have you thought it
over carefully, my son?

1069
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:09,723
Sometimes a person can think things
over so long, they never get done.

1070
01:30:09,774 --> 01:30:11,614
Pray for me, Father.
- Bless you, my son.

1071
01:30:11,665 --> 01:30:13,220
Open the gate.

1072
01:30:21,203 --> 01:30:22,521
A message!

1073
01:30:25,204 --> 01:30:26,712
I have a message.

1074
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:29,618
I have a message for the planters.

1075
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:32,314
Give the slaves back to us.
- And your cotton?

1076
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,212
Your beautiful cotton, my son.

1077
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:37,317
Are you aware that they
opened the levees as they ran?

1078
01:30:37,368 --> 01:30:39,325
You really ought to see to your fields.

1079
01:30:39,376 --> 01:30:40,685
And you really ought not to lie.

1080
01:30:40,736 --> 01:30:41,806
Legree!

1081
01:30:41,868 --> 01:30:43,790
They're drowning our cotton fields.

1082
01:30:43,841 --> 01:30:45,510
The sluice gates are open.

1083
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:47,724
We're coming back later.

1084
01:30:47,896 --> 01:30:49,724
Let's go, to the field!

1085
01:30:49,802 --> 01:30:51,311
We'll still be here.

1086
01:30:51,381 --> 01:30:52,912
Come on, let's go.

1087
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,210
Legree wants us to round up some niggers

1088
01:31:21,261 --> 01:31:22,679
that escaped and been causing trouble.

1089
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:23,692
What kind of trouble?

1090
01:31:23,759 --> 01:31:25,648
Opening levees and ruining crops,

1091
01:31:25,707 --> 01:31:26,812
killing and everything.

1092
01:31:26,863 --> 01:31:28,011
Let's go!

1093
01:31:29,104 --> 01:31:30,206
Come on!

1094
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:51,719
The gates, the sluice gates!

1095
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:54,522
Come on, close the sluice gates!

1096
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,325
There's one of them still here.

1097
01:32:44,108 --> 01:32:45,213
There.

1098
01:32:46,807 --> 01:32:49,824
You, damn you, you were their leader,

1099
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:51,651
the one who caused me all this trouble.

1100
01:32:51,702 --> 01:32:53,307
Leave him alone, Legree.

1101
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:02,306
How much do you want for him, Legree?

1102
01:33:09,005 --> 01:33:11,027
Dead niggers cost nothing.

1103
01:33:23,209 --> 01:33:24,420
Uncle Tom.

1104
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,205
Uncle Tom.

1105
01:33:32,504 --> 01:33:34,121
Thank you

1106
01:33:34,496 --> 01:33:38,033
for coming, Master George.

1107
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:43,523
I knew you would

1108
01:33:45,601 --> 01:33:47,609
some day.

1109
01:33:48,618 --> 01:33:49,718
You...

1110
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:16,263
You sure you seen something?

1111
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:18,582
I seen something, and it was black.

1112
01:34:18,633 --> 01:34:21,116
Well, I ain't seen nothing.
Let's go.

1113
01:36:28,109 --> 01:36:31,317
Now y'all gonna get a
taste of black justice.

1114
01:36:32,112 --> 01:36:34,227
You been making slaves out of us,

1115
01:36:34,398 --> 01:36:36,203
you been hunting us down,

1116
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:38,605
you been raping our women,

1117
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:41,819
you been taking our respect.

1118
01:36:43,603 --> 01:36:47,407
May God damn you to hell for
what you did to my daughter.

1119
01:36:48,996 --> 01:36:50,020
No!
