TOTÓ AND CAROLINA

6
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,206
Good evening.
- Hi.

7
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,000
Gotta light?
- Help yourself.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,826
Well..
- Well, what?

9
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,602
Want to come with me?

10
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,170
You got any money?
- Do I look I got no money?

11
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,618
Let me see it first.
- Oh! Don't you trust me?

12
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,002
To trust is good,
but to not trust, is better.

13
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:51,517
But you look like a good guy.
Let's go.

14
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,817
Yeah..

15
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,764
But to the police station!

16
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,507
See, I shouldn't trust!

17
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,654
Come on, get moving!
- Get off of me!

18
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,555
The patrol!

19
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,476
Wait, give me my money!

20
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:11,934
Get outta here!

21
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,897
Look at this bastard!
Wait! Wait!

22
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:20,928
Stop, stop! Look how he runs!

23
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,874
Crook! Criminal! Thief!

24
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,690
If I catch you, I'll send you to jail!

25
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,431
Criminal, jailbird!

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,594
Sergeant, I was robbed.
I want to file a complaint!

27
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:42,445
Let go, don't touch me! - To the station.
- Why not? - Come and tell me all about it.

28
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,651
Really, it'd better if
certain people went instead!

29
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:48,733
Bravo! Well done!

30
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,931
A scandal! An indecency!
Those sluts!

31
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,920
Come on, move it!

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,204
How dare you, Sergeant?
This is my husband!

33
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:59,212
What husband?
Elvira, don't bust my chops!

34
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,128
Ah, it's you, Sergeant.
No mustache, eh?

35
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,464
Yeah, I pawned it!

36
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,593
You were so much more handsome before..
- Three years in jail!

37
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:12,409
Excuse me, Excellency.

38
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:20,440
Come on, get down.
- Sergeant, we agree then, right?

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,401
If you won't let us work..
- You call that work!

40
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,807
They should give these guys a medal!

41
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,579
Did you hear me?

42
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,149
Make sure the baby doesn't get cold

43
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:35,849
and give him his bottle in a half hour
and again at six tomorrow morning!

44
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,509
Get off!
Get on the truck! Move it!

45
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,552
Mama mia, how embarrassing!
If they find out at my house!

46
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,219
Are we all here?

47
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,260
Were missing the driver?
- Caccavallo? And where is he?

48
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,223
Look, he's coming.

49
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,982
Hey!

50
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:55,931
Where have you been?

51
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:59,830
Don't you know regulation says
that a driver can't leave his post?

52
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,542
I know, Sergeant, but I can't stay
behind while my brothers fight.

53
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:05,738
We're officers, not stones.
Come!

54
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,159
Criminal, get up there!
- Get on! - Let's go!

55
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,888
Hurry up!
On board!

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Wait, here's another one!
- We're all full.

57
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,285
Let her sit up front then!
- Regulations prohibit it.

58
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,526
What prohibitions?
- What? Sergeant!

59
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,736
Nobody outside of the force
is allowed to sit up with the driver,

60
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:29,835
unless a superior orders it!
- Fine, I'll go by taxi.

61
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,318
Eh, well.. - Get her on fast!
- But the rules..

62
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,208
You and your rules!

63
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,973
Damn! Just now that we got the money.

64
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,960
Here.

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,001
Get down, come on.
Come on, let's go!

66
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,707
Sergeant, these tires had it.

67
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:19,737
It's the same with the other jeeps.
Try and apply for new tires.

68
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:21,800
Where are you going? Watch it!

69
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:31,131
Hey, who's on duty tonight?
- Marzachi.

70
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:34,002
What a drag!
Have Giovaninni question us!

71
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:37,401
It's a drag, is it?
You think I give the orders?

72
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,402
Hey, Fernanda!
- Marco, what didja do? Where ya going?

73
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:46,697
To Regina Coeli. - Then say hi to Beppe,
he's on the 4th floor. - OK.

74
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,531
Tell'em I talked to the lawyer
and not to worry! - OK.

75
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,300
What didja do?
- Nothing really.

76
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,365
What did he do?
- Skilled theft. - Oh, well!

77
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:59,427
What skill? Poor bastard!
He's always caught!

78
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,454
Always the same ones, eh?

79
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,082
Nothing new, Marshal.
The same old faces.

80
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,658
Good. We'll get this over with.

81
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,199
Check the file.

82
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,782
Zautini, Marcella!

83
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,800
Baiocchi, Fernanda!

84
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:25,257
Marshal, I want to file
a complaint because I was robbed.

85
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:29,321
You need to put more police
near Villa Borghese.

86
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,254
The worst of Rome's there!

87
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:34,560
And what were you doing
at Villa Borghese? - I was passing by.

88
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,272
Then don't pass by Villa Borghese again!

89
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,577
All of you, don't put a foot
in there for any reason!

90
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,300
How should I tell you?

91
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:47,852
Marshal, can I be home
tomorrow morning by 7?

92
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,192
Proietti, Anna Maria!

93
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:55,100
My God, how shameful!
Me in a police station!

94
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,880
If my mom finds out!
The shame!

95
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:02,176
De Angelis, Giovanna,
aka "The Ashamed".

96
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:04,590
Can I smoke a cigarette, Marshal?
- No.

97
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,339
De Angelis, Giovanna isn't on file.

98
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,582
Of course, I'm an honest person.
I've only been here four times!

99
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:15,409
See? She knows it better than you!
Look again.

100
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,647
Who do we have here?

101
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:20,900
Never seen before.

102
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,695
Well, occasionally
we renew the ranks, right?

103
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:26,876
And hopefully some will retire.

104
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:28,096
You're right.

105
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:30,366
Hey, what's your name?

106
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,219
Hey, I'm talking to you!

107
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:36,164
Carolina.

108
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,909
What else?

109
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,100
Any papers?
An I.D.?

110
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:54,215
De Vico, Carolina, daughter of Eustachio.
and Casimini, Lucia. Domestic.

111
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:56,002
Are you on file?

112
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,372
How should I know?
- What do you mean? Let's check.

113
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:03,509
De Vico, Carolina!

114
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:07,023
You walk the streets but
don't know if you're on file?

115
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,870
Who took her in?

116
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,412
Who?
- This one. Who took her in?

117
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:15,523
This one was taken in by Caccavallo.
- Ah! That's great!

118
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,524
Where are you from?

119
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,964
From Poggio Falcone.
- She's not on file.

120
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,982
You must work under the radar!

121
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:26,800
And not registered!

122
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:31,395
Register? - Don't you know you need
a membership card for this job?

123
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:32,815
Put a sock in it!

124
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:38,351
Listen, it's better you bring this one to
the commissioner. Let him deal with it.

125
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:42,511
I think she came from the country to
prostitute herself in Rome. - Let's go.

126
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:46,031
Great! As if there weren't
enough competition around here!

127
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,864
Where are you taking this one?
- To the commissioner. He'll deal with it.

128
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,439
It was my nose!
I realized I had a big fish!

129
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,322
My friend, it's all about smell.

130
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:18,164
What you need in life is a nose!

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,464
You won't talk, eh?
What did you do?

132
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:24,800
Caccavallo, leave it,
he's waiting for her. Come on.

133
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,623
Here we are, eh?

134
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,971
Who's that?
- That one?

135
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,022
A big deal!
Big as the atomic bomb!

136
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,846
Who would've thought!

137
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,331
By the way, I've a test on Thursday,
on the regulations. Help me study.

138
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,731
Ah! You're testing!
Then let me test you.

139
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,064
Let's see..

140
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:48,922
Here's one.

141
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:52,933
So.. "Public meetings and
assemblies in public places".

142
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:56,034
I know it. I know it completely.
- Yeah? Then, tell me..

143
00:10:56,201 --> 00:11:00,239
What if the order
to evacuate doesn't take effect?

144
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:01,701
Article 23.

145
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,924
You jump to 23!
Begin at the beginning, OK?

146
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:07,619
You said you knew it by heart.
- You caught me off guard!

147
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:10,132
Give me just the first word.
- Which?

148
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,890
The first!
- Just the first word?

149
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,593
I'm not telling.
- You're a big jerk!

150
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,812
Oh, I'm a jerk?
Nobody calls me a jerk!

151
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,933
Really? - No.
- No one? - No!

152
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:23,252
And yet, I would've sworn..
- Very funny.

153
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:27,062
Excuse me, the Commissioner?
- Second floor, up the steps.

154
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:31,735
The errand boy should have warned me!
- He did. - No, he didn't!

155
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:33,613
He did!
- He didn't!

156
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:37,208
The order.. - "If the order
to evacuate takes no effect.."

157
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,400
If the order to leave..
- To evacuate.

158
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,600
To evacuate.. - Takes no..
- I know, I know!

159
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,731
One gives.. - One gives the order..
the order.. - Evacuate.. - Evacuate..

160
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,632
The assembly..
- The assembly! I know!

161
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,869
Using the means of.. - the means..
- Three..

162
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,343
Of three..
- Don't tell me, I know it!

163
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,480
By three..
- Distinct forms of intimidation..

164
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,383
Distinct forms of inti..
- ..midation. - Intima-ding..

165
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,698
Three distinct forms..
I know. Don't tell me.!

166
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:05,049
Three distinct intima-ding...
ding-ding-ding..

167
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,867
Yeah, ding-ding-ding!
- These damn bells!

168
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,336
What bells? Intimidations!

169
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,494
Intima-ding-ding-ding-ation!

170
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,819
OK, "preceded by a.."
- God, I know!

171
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,789
Preceded by a..
- A.. - A..

172
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,537
Preceded by a..

173
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,756
A raspberry?
- A raspberry!

174
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,002
But you were going like this!
- It's a bugle.

175
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,918
No, a bugle goes like this!

176
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:30,530
It goes like this.
- If the bugle has no effect..

177
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:35,118
Then, man, you're in for it!
- Excuse me, whatcha eating?

178
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:37,799
It's fresh!

179
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,803
You could wash your hands.
- What's the big deal?

180
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,373
I just changed the tire
and washed the jeep.

181
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:47,531
By the way, how's the commissioner's
bust coming along? - It's moving along.

182
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,124
Thursday's his birthday.
- I know, but tomorrow's Sunday.

183
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,690
I'll be home all day to work on it.

184
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:57,031
You know what I'm missing?
- What? - Raw material.

185
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,351
You miss what?
You steal a kilo of crumb every day!

186
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,431
But the commissioner's
bust is life sized. - Right.

187
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,999
Caccavallo! - What?
The commissioner wants you. - Coming!

188
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,580
It's probably that
business about the girl..

189
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,718
This nose of mine!

190
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:26,300
I tell you the seven had no pair!
- You paired it with a seven!

191
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,431
What..?
- Shut up!

192
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:32,159
Hey, hey, hey!
Should I throw someone in jail?

193
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:47,007
I work, I don't beg for alms. - You must
work in the day, not when people sleep!

194
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,480
For three nights, he stopped at
my house and po-po-po-popom!

195
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,481
That's when I threw
the water on him. Yes, Sir.

196
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,660
Water!
- Water? That wasn't water!

197
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,364
Smell it, Sergeant!
My suit was ruined!

198
00:13:58,592 --> 00:13:59,662
Come in!

199
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:08,900
At your orders, Commissioner!

200
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,731
Come, tell me where
you found this one here.

201
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,731
Commissioner,
I was making a "circuminspection",

202
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:24,046
near the vicinity of Plaza de Siena,

203
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:27,436
when I suddenly..
spotted the accused!

204
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,720
Accused of what?

205
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,130
The act of prostitution, Sir.

206
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,463
Did you find her with anybody?
Were there any signs?

207
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,531
I don't need that kind of evidence.
Modestly, I don't like to brag,

208
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:44,066
I have a nose that, no disrespect
to anybody else's, has a great smell!

209
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,839
In other words, a nose
with a golden sniff!

210
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,439
Then smell this and see if it's piss.

211
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:52,073
What's this nonsense?
Get out! Who let you in?

212
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,023
Excuse me..
- You must wait outside until I tell you!

213
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,531
I thought.. - You mustn't think!
I forbid it! - Leave!

214
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,110
Just obey, understand?

215
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,700
I need to give permission
for you to enter, is that clear?

216
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:07,044
What? Is my face dirty?
- No.

217
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,576
A bug?
- Not at all!

218
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:12,031
Why do you stare then? - It's nothing.
Just a little surprise for your birthday.

219
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:15,535
Caccavallo, I've more than enough
surprises. I'm telling you again,

220
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,500
you need to worry about the vehicles.

221
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,831
What got in your head to grab this girl
when there's already a squad for that?

222
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:25,160
I wanted to help. Lend my support,
my experience, my sense of smell..

223
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,569
Caccavallo!
- Yes, Sir?

224
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,492
When you're on duty, you mustn't smell!
- Yes, Sir!

225
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:33,100
You must cover your nose! - Yes, Sir!
- Like this! - Yes, Sir!

226
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
What happened?
- Oh, faking it!

227
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:40,041
The same old act!
Get up, girl, up!

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,151
Damn, she took a bottle
of sleeping pills! - No!

229
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:48,410
Come, quick. Take her to the hospital!
- Shall I call an ambulance?

230
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,248
Hello, Holy Spirit Hospital?
- Ambulance! Drivers!

231
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,220
Could things get any worse?
A suicide is all we need!

232
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,200
Holy Spirit Hospital. Hurry.

233
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:01,031
Idiot! Look at the mess we're in!

234
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,531
I'd like to know where you found her?
Where?

235
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,497
At Villa..  - Shut up!
- Villa.. - Shut up!

236
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:10,551
If she dies, the newspapers and
press will say we tortured her!

237
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,980
After the Egidi case,
we can't even hit anybody!

238
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,600
Clear out! Clear out!
- The doctor on duty, please.

239
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,411
Go with her and make sure
they attend to her right away!

240
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,276
And bring me word. Go! Don't wait!
- Yes, Sir, I fly!

241
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,816
Hello..
This is Commissioner Ascella, Doctor.

242
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:35,031
Excuse me, Sister. How is she?
- No need to worry.

243
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:38,431
It's just that I've orders to make
sure the victim is well attended.

244
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,731
Who is the doctor on duty?
- Dr. Rinaldi, a talented young man.

245
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,092
When he has more experience,
he'll go far. - More? He doesn't have any?

246
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:49,106
Well, he just graduated. But he's
the son of Dr. Rinaldi, our director.

247
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,521
Let's hope!

248
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,432
I put on my signal!

249
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:11,099
But you gotta do it 100 meters ahead.
Not at the last moment! - Silence!

250
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:37,800
Article 455..
"If an offender.."

251
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,100
Courage, my son. Courage.

252
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:58,147
This one is finished too.
- And now? Good heavens!

253
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:00,381
Now I'm going home to take a nice nap.

254
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,531
A nap? - Thank God,
I'm done with this annoyance!

255
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:07,662
Doctor, fine, I get it.
A criminal, a refractory wanderer..

256
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,088
but a little respect!
It's a human cadaver!

257
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,169
What cadaver?
- Which one? That one there.

258
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,781
What cadaver?
That one's out of danger.

259
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:18,031
She had her stomach pumped.
- Pumped? Is she really out of danger?

260
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,500
And wasn't she on the danger list?

261
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,732
Poisons are poisonous.

262
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,783
Calm down, it was nothing. - What nothing?
If she dies, it falls on me!

263
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:31,431
Don't worry, it's not serious. She's out
of danger, take it from me. - From you?

264
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes. - What does dad think?
- What says dad? - Which dad?

265
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,070
Your dad, the director, the doctor,
the good one, who heals..

266
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,500
What do I know? - What do you mean?
A peripatetic case, "what do I know"?

267
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,818
Doctor, I say we should call dad.

268
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:47,431
You're joking! You want
to call my dad for such nonsense!

269
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,500
Nonsense! Somebody on the danger list
and you call that a nonsense?

270
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,277
Come on, call dad, please. - Listen,
that girl can be released tomorrow.

271
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:58,240
She will but I won't! Let's call dad.
Let's hear what daddy says!

272
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,316
Daddy!

273
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,547
They're kids!
What can you do?

274
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:08,317
What will happen? If this goes bad..
Let me take a peek.

275
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:28,387
She's better, but must sleep until
tomorrow. Evening. - Evening.

276
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,392
Who are you? What a scare!
What's the matter?

277
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:49,036
She's the one who took poison? - Yes.
- Why? - How do I know?

278
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,778
Ah, maybe there's a win at lotto here!

279
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,607
Poison, 18. Anything else about her?
- Yeah, imagine if I should spread info!

280
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:02,524
Yet, I always guess the right numbers.
Last month, I won 12,000 lire.

281
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,005
12,000 lire! By Jove!
And how?

282
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:06,456
Who is she?

283
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,731
A slut. - 78! Did you arrest her?
- With all due modesty.

284
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:14,936
The arrest gives 40..
No, we must put 24 for a guard.

285
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,629
The guard, 24? - 24..
I'm 24? - Yes.

286
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,495
And I'm worth just 24?
- What's wrong with 24?

287
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:24,314
Officer Caccavallo doesn't get
played for lotto! Got it? Go away.

288
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,031
Then the police.. is 4.
- Play 4.

289
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:35,005
Then we have 4, 18, 40 and 78, eh?
- What did you say? Come back here!

290
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,089
4, 18,

291
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:42,878
18...40...
- 40 and 78..

292
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,845
No, but I'll play 24. I like it.
- 24?

293
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:49,619
I play that too.
- That's it, nice.

294
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:51,189
One more, one less..

295
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:53,667
Here we go..

296
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,642
Professor Rinaldi, please.
- In the back, after the elevator.

297
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:50,731
Here he is.

298
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:56,395
Hey, you!
Hey, you!

299
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,223
Leave me be..
- HEY! - Who's that?

300
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,905
Police! - Fine, but we need to remove
the sheets to disinfect them.

301
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,964
Disinfect? Am I infected?

302
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:08,849
Not you, that old lady died yesterday!

303
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:13,445
Tha.. tha.. that old lady died?
Why didn't you put up a sign?

304
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:17,306
Why should we? - What a world we live in!
No peace, no God, no hygiene!

305
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,836
Infection!

306
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,158
Doctor!

307
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,310
Doctor!
Listen, Doctor!

308
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,300
I'm infected, Doctor!

309
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:28,265
Oh, damn it, Doctor!

310
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:33,009
Doctor! Doctor!
Where is he? Doctor!

311
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,396
Doctor, please..
Ah, it's you again? - Yes.

312
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:38,815
Did you rest well?
- What rest? You must do something.

313
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:41,111
I'm infected.
- Infected? - Yes.

314
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:43,715
I slept in the old lady's bed
who died last night.

315
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:47,396
Ah, no. She was an old street beggar.
She died of consumption.

316
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:51,512
Consumption? -Yes. - What's that?
- In short, has died of weakness.

317
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:54,112
I already feel a little weak!
- Dead from hunger.

318
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:57,360
Hunger?
That changes things, it's a trifle.

319
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,046
Instead I thought..
- No, died from hunger.

320
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,091
Thank you, Doctor.
My respects, Doctor.

321
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,831
Doctor! My respects!
At your service!

322
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,559
At times...

323
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,800
Your superior is looking for you.
- My superior? The commissioner?

324
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,470
In the doctor's office..
- Down there? Thanks.

325
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,307
Please, Sister, may I have this crumb?
- Go right ahead. - Thank you, Sister.

326
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:35,614
At your service, Commissioner.
- You've been lucky.

327
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:38,831
If that girl went.. - How could she?
I was here all night!

328
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,827
I meant if she died.
- How could she when I'm here?

329
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:44,631
You see, Sir?
- The Daddy! Are you daddy?

330
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,297
I've had the pleasure of meeting
your son, Doctor. Very nice guy.

331
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,272
He's quite competent!
- Yeah.

332
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:54,276
Sir.. - I must attend to my patients.
I'm leaving.

333
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,093
Remember what I said.
The girl is the impulsive type..

334
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,631
A hypochondriac, psychologically weak.
- Yes..

335
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,444
She could try to kill herself
in the near future.

336
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:07,745
You must keep an eye on her.
- Thank you for taking your time.

337
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:11,011
Excuse me, do you mind if I have
a few words with my subordinate?

338
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,818
As you wish.
- Very nice of you.

339
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:20,100
Look at this! They're already
saying that we're torturers,

340
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,557
we mistreat poor defenseless girls; our
methods are unworthy of a civilization!

341
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:26,312
With names, dates and all!

342
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,520
Names? Did they mention me?
- Of course, read it.

343
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,325
I can? - Yes!
- May I, Sir? - Be my guest!

344
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:36,117
It makes one proud.
- Naturally!

345
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,409
"An officer of bad judgment..
inhuman.. who doesn't deserve.."

346
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,584
Look at the mess you've gotten us into!

347
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:49,282
Is it my fault? - No, mine!
It was you who took her in.

348
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:52,713
She was fine at Villa Borghese,
not bothering anyone..

349
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,231
But no! You arrive with your nose
and bring her here to kill herself.

350
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:59,183
But she's not dead, right?
- Fine, but now she's our problem!

351
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:03,973
We can't arrest her, since she did
nothing wrong. She was there by chance.

352
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,064
Nor can we let her go
because you heard the doctor.

353
00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:10,935
She might kill herself and then
we'll get scandal, the press..

354
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:13,010
I wonder why she wants to do it.

355
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,131
Ah, dear friend, today there's
a lot of reasons to kill oneself.

356
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:19,901
So, we're obliged to find
accommodations for her anyway we can.

357
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:21,841
And you must take care of this.
- Me?

358
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:25,038
What can I do?
- She's not Roman, she came here to work.

359
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:28,713
So you bring her back to her town.
You'll find some relative, friend..

360
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:32,710
Some idiot who'll take care of her!
If not, leave her with the town police.

361
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:36,015
You're acting on behalf of order.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:37,847
In the name of the law!
- Yessir!

363
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:41,479
Hurry up, so you can be back tonight.
- But Sir.. - Caccavallo..

364
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:44,430
You've asked for a promotion.
- Yes, sir!

365
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:48,278
If you don't find a place for this girl,
I won't sign your request.

366
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:50,202
Do whatever you want.

367
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:53,358
But if you come back with her,
no more promotion!

368
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,992
Understand?
And make sure that

369
00:25:56,062 --> 00:26:00,986
she doesn't try to escape or
kill herself under your custody,

370
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:04,400
I swear to God, I'll throw you out!
Clear? - Yes, Sir!

371
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:09,131
Who do I give her to?
I guess any old fool would do.

372
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,550
I have things to do. Beat it.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:13,758
Look what one's gotta do!

374
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:27,668
Where are we going?
- To Poggio Falcone, your town.

375
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:31,600
I don't want to go there!
- Oh, no? Well, I'm bringing you.

376
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:36,900
Better to have died.
- Better, yes. But not at the station.

377
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,612
Did I go there?
It was you who brought me!

378
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,700
Can you tell me why you wanted to do it?
- That's my business, why should you care?

379
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,570
Come on, get out! Move it!

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,014
Where are we going?
- None of your business.

381
00:26:57,238 --> 00:27:02,741
I've a family! A position!
If I'm absent, I have to let them know.

382
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,340
I'm not trash like you!
Wretch, keep moving!

383
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,831
Good day.
- Good day, Ma'am.

384
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,265
Ah, Mr. Antonio!
- What is it?

385
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,515
This is becoming a habit.

386
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,265
Ten days ago, my father-in-law's
underwear went missing. - By Jove!

387
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,720
And this morning a pair of socks!

388
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,531
Not to complain, but it must be a thief.
- Of course.

389
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:30,799
No doubt about it.
- It must be a thief.

390
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:34,802
OK, Ma'am. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of it. - OK, thanks.

391
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:38,731
Don't forget, don't forget!
- Leave it to me!

392
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:41,200
Ah, Mrs. Agatha..
- Yeah?

393
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,620
Give me the features of the stolen goods.

394
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,031
A pair of gray socks with red stripes,
brand new, bought this morning.

395
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:51,055
Grey with red stripes,
bought this morning? - Yes.

396
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:55,934
I'm on it. - Thanks a lot. - You should
skulk in the terrace to guard the laundry.

397
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:00,100
Right. Looks like I'll have
to send some neighbor to jail!

398
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,738
Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

399
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,975
You wait here.

400
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:07,731
Hi, Dad. How come you didn't
come home last night?

401
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,938
Give me those socks of Mrs. Agatha's!
- You come in and start!

402
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:14,631
Give me those socks!
- What socks? - You know!

403
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:17,620
I should shoot you!
I'll kill you! Give them here!

404
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,682
Don't you dare lay a finger on him!
- Very nice!

405
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:25,272
Threats! Dad.. dad,
don't obstruct the course of justice!

406
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,494
It wasn't him!
- Oh, no? Then, what's that?

407
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:30,799
What's this stuff?

408
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:34,230
What is this? Bravo!
Now we're perjurers.

409
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:38,298
Eh? I've a son who is a thief.
Yes, Sir, a child thief!

410
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,731
He stole eggs from
the hen on the sixth floor.

411
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,443
And grandpa gives false testimony!

412
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:47,956
Dad! Dad, in my position..
I wear a uniform!

413
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,295
Your position!

414
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:53,330
Then, buy some socks for your son!
So he wouldn't have to steal!

415
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,881
Buy socks for my son?
I bought him some when he was 7!

416
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,506
But, I'm 10 now!
- Bad thief!

417
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,818
I'll kill you! Get out of here!
Get out!

418
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:04,978
Shame on you!
Shame on you!

419
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:10,314
They want to kill me in this house!
Kill me! I can't take it anymore!

420
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:15,371
You, come here.
Sit there and don't move! Eh?

421
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:20,167
Oh, I see! I see! You thought
it was going to be easy, didn't you?

422
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:26,232
I'm not that stupid!
Not at all.

423
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:30,783
I'm not eating home today.
I'm on duty. - Oh, thank goodness!

424
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:37,314
Oh, God, there's a crack!
Look at the mouth.

425
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:40,260
It's your fault!
Yes, your fault!

426
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:45,085
I told you to keep it wet.
You must sprinkle it every two hours!

427
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,459
This isn't marble, it's crumb!

428
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,858
Look at this, look at this:
all the front profile, disappeared!

429
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:56,137
You know what you are, Dad? - Eh?
- You know what you are? Reckless!

430
00:29:56,464 --> 00:30:00,830
I have so much to do all day, and
I should also look after that big head!

431
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:05,131
I already do the cleaning,
the cooking, the shopping!

432
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:09,813
Really? That's unimportant stuff.
All of secondary importance.

433
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:12,271
This is the bust of an important person.

434
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,381
Don't you understand that
this means a promotion?

435
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:19,381
Should I say it in Japanese?
- Not even a resemblance! - You, shut up!

436
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:24,136
He's right! - He is?
What do you two know? Peasants!

437
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:27,052
It's rage that makes you talks so, envy!

438
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,859
You who look like an intelligent person,
tell me..

439
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:33,410
Who is this, eh?

440
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:39,256
Dunno! - "Dunno"?
Look closer, it's someone you know.

441
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:41,500
A very important person!

442
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,867
Mussolini?
- How stupid! Mussolini!

443
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:49,495
The commissioner's portrait, right?

444
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,865
He has no nose.
- What do you mean?

445
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:54,784
Well, with a few touches,
it'll be perfect.

446
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,572
Look who I'm asking!

447
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:01,931
Who took the crumb I left here?
- Not me.

448
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:06,017
Not you? The first chicken who sings
is the one who laid the egg. It was you!

449
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:10,120
Is it possible that you should
keep all the crumb for yourself?

450
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:14,031
I can't eat the crust,
I don't have teeth!

451
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:19,028
And one of these days, I'll eat
that whole head!- Oh, great!

452
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:24,293
We now know who ate the horse
of Commander Diaz! Here it is.

453
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:28,931
Commander Diaz is off the horse.
It was you. Confess!

454
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:30,939
I confess: I did it.

455
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,865
And as soon as you go,
I'll eat that big head too!

456
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,485
Oh, yeah? As true as I'm in
this uniform, I'll arrest you!

457
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,958
In the name of the law,
I'll handcuff you, throw you in jail!

458
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:46,612
The Commissioner's head
must not be touched! Got it?

459
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,017
Don't touch the head!
Don't touch it!

460
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,278
And you, don't move!

461
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:03,389
Keep an eye on her!
She's a suicidal maniac!

462
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:05,384
She's right!

463
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,975
Why do you want to kill yourself?
- Because I'm miserable.

464
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:21,621
Big deal! What about me then?
Yet I got to be 70 years old.

465
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,110
So? You're not a woman.
- You're right about that.

466
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,900
What's your job?
- I was a servant.

467
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,601
Why did you quit?

468
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:33,682
Where you gonna go now?

469
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,699
I'm being taken to my hometown,
Poggio Falcone. - Good wine, there!

470
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,325
Go hang them.

471
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,842
Kid, what are you doing?
Go study and leave it to me! Go.

472
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,600
No, no, not that!

473
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,973
Good, you can lend me a hand.

474
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,357
Here's today's sandwich.
- Dad..

475
00:33:21,937 --> 00:33:24,471
The button, you haven't sewn it yet.

476
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:28,599
I can't sew, my hands shake!
- All the better.

477
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:32,212
This way, you'll stop
smoking those "Tuscans".

478
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:35,657
What does that have to do with it?
- It does! It does!

479
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:40,598
Every months, there are dozens
and dozens of lire going up in smoke!

480
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:44,736
Ever since my poor Matilde died,
there's been no peace in this house.

481
00:33:45,248 --> 00:33:48,437
Am I to blame? I do what I can!

482
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:52,483
I'm old! Don't you understand that I'm old?
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

483
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:56,428
But what can we do?
We can't get a maid, she costs money.

484
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:59,339
And at my age, I can't remarry.

485
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:04,681
And you can't sew one button, right?
- But that's women's work.

486
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,803
Ask her, who's hanging the laundry.
Have her sew it.

487
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:11,916
Right! That's all I need!

488
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,965
Asking someone under watch to sew a button!
A suicide maniac!

489
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:21,680
Dad, in my position.. I wear a uniform!
Is there anything in your head? - Yeah..

490
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,038
Oh, God!
Oh, by Jove!

491
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,034
She's flinging herself! Flinging!

492
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:34,343
Quietly..

493
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:46,199
Get away from there! Jerk!
- Let go of me!

494
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:51,100
Who's putting... Go away!
This thing on my head?

495
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:55,294
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare, you filthy coward!

496
00:34:55,745 --> 00:35:00,919
Silence! At your.. places!
At your places!

497
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:04,082
You wanted to fool me, eh?
Thinking of jumping out, eh?

498
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,381
It didn't even cross my mind!
- Oh, yeah?

499
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:10,931
Why were you pushing then? - Dad, it was me!
I thought she had to be thrown out.

500
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,597
Oh, yeah? Study and be quiet!
Or I'll slap you silly!

501
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,674
I told you not to move from the chair.
Why did you move? Oh yeah?

502
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:23,523
You sit there and don't move,
or I'll chain you up!

503
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,859
And now, sew this button.

504
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:32,450
Dad, who was the Hero of the Two Worlds?
- The Hero of the Two Worlds?

505
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,786
Who was the Hero of the Two Worlds..

506
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:38,200
The Hero of the Two Worlds..
What was his name again?

507
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:43,098
I have it on the tip of my tongue.

508
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:48,031
I know it but I won't tell you!
I won't tell you! That'd be too easy.

509
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,453
"I have a cultured father, I'll get him
to do my homework!" Nice stuff!

510
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:57,431
You have to do as I did!
I did everything without anybody's help!

511
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:01,235
Got it? And today, with all due modesty,
thanks to God, I have a position

512
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,500
despite having an ignorant father!

513
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:07,858
Respect your father in front of your child!
You're shameless!

514
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:11,430
Oh, yeah? And you respect your son
in front of your grandson. Understand?

515
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,029
Don't forget to keep the commissioner's
head moist. Use the sprinkler.

516
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,049
And you, look me in the eye..

517
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:21,069
I forbid you to climb to the terrace, eh?
Understand?

518
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,351
"A word is enough to the wise."

519
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:27,037
OK. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, eh.. let's go.

520
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:34,482
One moment. - What?
- They have good wine in Monte Falcone.

521
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:40,331
What? It's already gone? Already?
It didn't even last a week!

522
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:43,103
Dad, is there anything in your head!
I won't buy it.

523
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:47,759
In this house, money goes pouring out!
Torrents! Oceans! Floods!

524
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:48,950
Come on.

525
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:51,833
And the pay "volatilizes".
I'm fed up!

526
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,717
Hey, tell me.

527
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:09,573
To get to your town, do you turn
right or left? - Left. - Left? Hmm..

528
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:13,231
Excuse me,  to go to Monte Falcone,
right or left?

529
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:16,580
<i>To the right, keep going straight.</i>
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

530
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,303
Remember, that Officer Antonio Caccavallo
can never be made a fool of!

531
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,376
Right or left, I'm not going to my town.

532
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,832
Oh, yeah?
We'll see about that!

533
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:47,918
There's plenty of room..
- Yeah, like I'm going to pick up a spy!

534
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:51,598
You need a nose to recognize them.

535
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:56,145
Remember, Officer Antonio Caccavallo
will always be Officer Antonio Caccavallo!

536
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,931
Hey, pretty brunette!
- Hey, hey!

537
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,673
Sit down! Knock it off! Behave!

538
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:09,381
Or else I'll put the handcuffs on,
got it? In the name of the Law!

539
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:26,551
Stop, I've dropped my comb!
- Right! I know that old trick!

540
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,181
Oh, Lord, it did fall, won't you stop?

541
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,673
If it fell, it fell! Knock it off!
Behave! Shut up!

542
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,691
Got it? That's an order!
By Jove!

543
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:40,252
This is very serious, no joking matter!
Where are we? - Miss! - Where are we?

544
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:44,981
Oh, thanks. It was very nice of you.
- Please, it was nothing.

545
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:48,415
I don't know how to thank you.
- Beat it! Hey, boy, beat it!

546
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:51,025
Shoo! Shoo!
Let's go! Got it?

547
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,699
By Jove!
Today I'll have to arrest everybody!

548
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:02,661
And don't be provoking.
Stay where you are and don't provoke!

549
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,703
This is an honest jeep!

550
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:11,033
It was a keepsake.
- A fine keepsake, Villa Borghese.. Bah!

551
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:16,221
Men of all colors, ages and nations..
Bah!

552
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:18,800
Throw it away! Throw it away!

553
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:22,736
It was a memory of my mother.
- Some mother!

554
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,000
If it was up to me,
I'd throw her in prison!

555
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,495
You can't, she's dead.

556
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:39,303
<i># The red flag, the red flag.</i>

557
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:43,137

00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:52,500
They hog the road as if they owned it!

<i># The red flag will triumph.
Long live socialism and freedom!</i>

562
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:05,000
Freedom, freedom?
Lean to the right! Lean to the right!

563
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,400
Risking to break both our necks.
- I wish!

564
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,432
Let's see..

565
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:32,146
Damn it! Damn those jerks!
I'll put them in their place!

566
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:34,830
You like to disturb traffic, eh?

567
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,286
Oh, excuse me, Reverend. Sorry.
- Did we hit you hard, my son?

568
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:41,334
Heavens, just a tap!
Please, it was just an accident.

569
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,537
I'm very sorry.
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

570
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,833
Don't worry, please forgive me.
I kiss your hands, Reverend.

571
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:55,670
<i># We worship God, the Virgin Mary,
benignly listening..</i>

572
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,847
What happened?
- He hit his head against the bar.

573
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,727
I wish it had been us!
- Shoo, shoo, what a jinx!

574
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:14,863
Let's see if we can..

575
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,553
I'm so hungry, I can't see. - We'll be
there in an hour and you'll eat.

576
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:23,000
I've no one in that town.
Neither friends, home or relatives!

577
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,970
You can't say you have no home.

578
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,431
Why not? - Why not?
Don't you know that it's against the law?

579
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:30,442
With no home, you go to jail!

580
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:35,114
Don't you think I'd like to have
a house, garden, husband and children?

581
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:36,576
Stop kidding!

582
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:51,684
How I would like to travel!
- And aren't we traveling?

583
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,620
Let's go.

584
00:41:54,064 --> 00:42:03,000
<i># Oh, white flowers, symbol of love.
With you the glory of victory.</i>

585
00:42:11,353 --> 00:42:12,800
Here, help me eat.

586
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,439
Can I have a bite?

587
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,985
Now you want to take
the bread from my mouth?

588
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:30,150
Don't you understand that this piece
has got to last me until tonight?

589
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:41,026
Hey, stop, I feel like throwing up!

590
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
Hold on, we're almost there.

591
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:52,784
No, stop, I'm feeling sick! Stop, please!
- Don't make a mess in the car!

592
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:54,434
Outside! Outside!

593
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:10,398
Young lady, well?
- Nothing's coming up.

594
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,803
You'll have to force it, purge yourself.
- Purge what?

595
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:17,866
In two days, I've only had coffee.
- Fine, vomit up coffee. What can you do?

596
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:21,581
Now that we've stopped, I don't
feel sick. - What do you want to do?

597
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,803
Let's stay here.
- Yeah, stay here!

598
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,700
Now, to the right or to the left?
- Left.

599
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,885
The left? - Yes.
- Then we'll go right.

600
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:48,452
Remember: Officer Antonio Caccavallo
can never be hoodwinked!

601
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:57,000
This one again? Where do they come from?
Nein, nein, nein!

602
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:15,783
Hey, where did you take me?
- Me? You're the smart one.

603
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:28,250
Listen, dear, look out your side.

604
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:32,890
Can I? Huh?

605
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:35,789
Go on.

606
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,450
I really can?

607
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,431
Sure, sure...

608
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:44,374
What now?

609
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,355
Go on.

610
00:44:57,023 --> 00:45:01,467
Oh, God! Oh, God!
We're suspended between life and death!

611
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,760
Better to die than to go back.

612
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,939
So it's OK to kill me!
So it's OK to kill me!

613
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:10,931
I'm a father, I have a position!
- Then let me go! - Be still!

614
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:13,950
Delinquent! Killer! Stop,
you'll kill us both! - I wish!

615
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,617
Are you crazy? Stop!

616
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,283
You wish? I'll kill you myself
with a knock on the head!

617
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,512
I'll kill you myself!

618
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:27,739
Then let me leave.
- You want to ruin me?

619
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:33,086
Stay still, I'll let you! I'll let you go!
I'll let you, stay still!

620
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,668
I'll let you go, just stay still.

621
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:40,600
Oh, my God! My God, what a Sunday
I'm spending with this nut!

622
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:46,611
My Jesus! Holy Virgin! Help me.
Somebody get us out of here.

623
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:53,141
Thank you! Thank you!
Do not move!

624
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:59,647
<i># Forward, people, comrades to arms.</i>
- See, see.

625
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:07,000
<i># The red flag will triumph.</i>

626
00:46:07,395 --> 00:46:08,695
Help!

627
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:13,802
Help!
Hey, comrades!

628
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:21,203
Come on, guys, a rope.

629
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:24,517
Easy, easy,
we're hanging by a thread!

630
00:46:24,587 --> 00:46:27,013
Don't worry, Sergeant,
we'll just be a jiff.

631
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:30,239
Thanks, we're in your hands!
Look what hands you put me in!

632
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,812
Everybody ready?
- We're ready here.

633
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:35,558
See what a work, Sarge?
You can get down now.

634
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:38,231
Thanks, but are we sure?
- You can rest easy now.

635
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:43,315
Careful not to make it shake.
Don't run! Come here! Come here!

636
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,774
You told me that I'd be free.
- Come here!

637
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:50,621
Don't be insubordinate.
No kidding! Let's go. Let's go!

638
00:46:57,138 --> 00:47:02,200
You, do me a favor. Make sure this girl
doesn't escape, OK? - Yes, Sergeant.

639
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:06,345
Easy! Easy!

640
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,500
Let me go.

641
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,400
A fine communist you are!
Can't you see I'm poor like you?

642
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:41,500
Want some candy?
- I can't be bought.

643
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:49,989
Sergeant, you're out of time!
- A little patience. Come on!

644
00:47:51,797 --> 00:47:53,821
Tell me, what did you do?

645
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:57,127
I hit a boss.

646
00:47:57,197 --> 00:48:02,180
Bravo! You hit a boss?
Escape! Go!

647
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,900
Long live freedom!
Down with bosses forever!

648
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:13,931
Where's the girl?
- She fled, fled, fled!

649
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:17,228
What "fled, fled, fled"?
I'll throw you in jail!

650
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:20,251
Help me to find the girl.
- Sergeant, we have a party.

651
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:23,922
Yeah? You can party while that
poor girl goes and kills herself?

652
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:26,231
Who?
- The girl who was with me!

653
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:28,931
One, two, three: Look in the meadows.
You by the hill.

654
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:30,601
You stay by the truck.

655
00:48:30,996 --> 00:48:33,748
You get in the car.
We'll take to the road. - Yes, sir.

656
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:37,991
At your service.. Damn it!
Is the way clear?

657
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,500
END OF PART ONE

658
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,500
PART TWO

659
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:33,684
<i>Miss!
- Stop!</i>

660
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,108
So it's you who's stealing my tools!

661
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,168
<i>Stop!</i>

662
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:44,320
<i>Stop!</i>

663
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,449
Stop!

664
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:44,646
Stop!
You can't escape!

665
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,979
Well? Are you sick?
- I can't stand anymore.

666
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,767
I haven't eaten in 3 days.

667
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:03,918
Sergeant, this one is hungry.
Her stomach is empty.

668
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:10,005
Her head is empty! Her head is empty!
Up! Up!

669
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,608
Sergeant, there's a tavern. Let her eat
something or she'll fall down. - Alright.

670
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:18,732
Take it. Alright, let's go. Come.
- Don't worry, go.

671
00:51:24,187 --> 00:51:25,239
Let's go.

672
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,312
Come here!

673
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,917
Hey, unhandcuff me.

674
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:41,146
I won't do it again. I promise.

675
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:47,765
I swear. Take them off. Don't make me
look bad in front of these people.

676
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:53,204
Thank you.

677
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:04,679
May I, Miss?
- What "May I"? Please! Let's go.

678
00:52:08,348 --> 00:52:09,928
That's all we needed!

679
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:19,907
Host!

680
00:52:20,835 --> 00:52:24,286
I'll give you a feast
like you never had in your life!

681
00:52:25,336 --> 00:52:28,236
Some wine?
- A bottle of water and two glasses.

682
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:35,315
Let's look at the cold cuts.
Salami Milanese: 180, prosciutto: 220!

683
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:42,460
Ham: 190, pork: 110.
- Very fresh, just sliced this morning.

684
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:46,130
I don't like pork.
- Fifty grams of pork, and water!

685
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,533
Gee, that's a lot!
- Yeah!

686
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:51,778
You're used to those who
splurge millions for you!

687
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:54,869
I'm used to eating the bosses'
leftovers, actually.

688
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:57,417
Respect your boss
and he'll treat you well.

689
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:58,966
Come on!

690
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:04,082
Yeah, you think it'd be easy, eh?

691
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,541
Fill up!

692
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:17,796
Remember to buy wine for your father.

693
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:24,743
Did you hear me? Hey!
- Shh! Don't distract me.

694
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:28,425
Now I have it between my fingers.
- What?

695
00:53:28,684 --> 00:53:30,340
The commissioner's nose.

696
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,268
Where did you learn to sculpt?
- In the old days. Prison.

697
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:40,108
You were in prison? - Yes, but don't
make a mistake. In prison, I was a guard.

698
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,360
And in my free time, I'd go to
Professor Ciccariello's cell.

699
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:49,149
The famous sculptor Ciccariello!
You've never heard of him?

700
00:53:50,236 --> 00:53:53,523
He was my teacher!
A great sculptor!

701
00:53:53,907 --> 00:53:57,400
A poet of the crumb!
He was the only one who could mold it.

702
00:53:58,037 --> 00:54:02,452
You know what Ciccariello said?
The crumb in his hands became music!

703
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:08,400
What a man! So sensitive!
So kind! What a heart! What an artist!

704
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,395
Why was he in prison?
- He stabbed his mother.

705
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:14,859
Twenty-seven stab wounds, all mortal!

706
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:19,632
He was a moody man! Full of ingenuity!
They don't make them like that anymore.

707
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:27,150
Excuse me, are you going to eat
the crumb? - Yes! - Never mind.

708
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,899
<i>Get off of me, I'll kill him!</i>

709
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,501
What's going on?

710
00:54:35,764 --> 00:54:36,824
Yes!

711
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:42,449
What have I done, Sergeant?
- Silence! Stay here!

712
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:46,526
Everybody freeze in the name of the law!
Freeze!

713
00:54:49,714 --> 00:54:51,062
Silence!

714
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,894
Enough!
- Right on time! Repeat what you said!

715
00:54:54,964 --> 00:54:57,974
Yeah, yeah. I'm a humble Venetian farmer.

716
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,259
I was in the Great War, alright?
Check my papers, look..

717
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,342
I'm not checking a thing!
Just the facts!

718
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:08,327
Well.. I'm a humble Venetian..
- You already said that. - OK.

719
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:11,026
I earn what I earn and don't complain..
- Yes, Sir..

720
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:13,328
I respect the law, hats off..

721
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:18,614
But I say, I too have
the right to ask for pork!

722
00:55:18,684 --> 00:55:22,102
Just cut fresh this morning!
- What fresh? My cat is dead!

723
00:55:22,172 --> 00:55:23,461
I'll kill you!

724
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,673
Silence, nobody move!
Silence or I'll throw you all in jail!

725
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:36,386
I'll lock you up on a new charge!
You'll never get out!

726
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,700
Someone died, got it?

727
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:47,287
No joking with the dead!

728
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,505
Who died?
- The cat.

729
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:52,328
What's the cat got to do with it?

730
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:55,341
The cat ate the pork
and the pork roasted the cat.

731
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:59,325
I don't understand. The cat
ate the fork and the fo..fo..fo..

732
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,390
Speak Italian, be clear!

733
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,083
In short, I humbly..
- The cat ate the pork?

734
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:06,654
That I humbly had left on my plate.

735
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:09,197
And when I came home, the cat was dead.

736
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:12,451
By Jove! The cat ate the pork,
the pork is poisoned!

737
00:56:12,521 --> 00:56:16,165
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Carolina! Carolina!

738
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:27,321
Excuse me. Where is she? Where?
Come here. Come. How are you feeling?

739
00:56:27,793 --> 00:56:31,951
Fine, why? - Fine? Don't you know
you've eaten poisoned pork?

740
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,471
Ah, poisoned pork!

741
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:37,030
Sergeant, I cut it fresh this morning!
- Criminal! Assassin!

742
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,988
Get away from me!
I'll throw you in jail!

743
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:43,827
Thoughtless, put down that candy.
You have one foot in the grave!

744
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:46,988
What shall I do? Tell me!
- I'll take you to the hospital on my Vespa.

745
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:49,880
And if she dies on the road?
- A doctor!A doctor!

746
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,547
The doctor went hunting.
- And the pharmacist?

747
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:56,561
He went hunting with the doctor.
- Make her drink soap water, no?

748
00:56:56,631 --> 00:57:00,359
Make way, make way, here's the midwife!
- Make way, make way!

749
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,081
Did it smell bad?
- Don't know, it seemed fresh.

750
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:08,831
I cut it this morning, Sergeant!
- Go away, murderer! Go away!

751
00:57:08,901 --> 00:57:12,365
She needs milk. - Milk!
- You're right!

752
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:16,322
You're right! She needs.. she needs..
mi.. mil.. excuse me.

753
00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:21,727
Sarge, I have wine, but where can I get
milk? - Go away, I'll put you in jail!

754
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:25,039
Milk, but it must be raw.
And two or three liters.

755
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:28,750
Two or three liters! Cow milk! Sheep!
Goat! - Hey, Sergeant! - What?

756
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:37,053
Near here, there's a farm with two cows.
Tell them that I sent you: Tony Capron.

757
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:41,340
Tony Capron, yes. Let's go!
- We're friends, like brothers..

758
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,590
This had to happen to me!

759
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,445
Daddy, Daddy!

760
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:27,300
Here it is.

761
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:32,861
Is it boiled?
- Boiled? Didn't you hear the midwife?

762
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:36,831
It must be raw. - I don't like that.
I want it boiled with a drop of coffee.

763
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:39,211
Coffee? You crazy? Coffee is poison!

764
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:42,665
Come on, baby.
Do you really want to die?

765
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,100
I don't care if I die.

766
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:49,500
Just look at this:
It's magnificent, pure milk.

767
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,565
This is first rate stuff!
Look, I'll drink some first. See?

768
00:59:58,586 --> 01:00:01,362
Is it good?
- First rate!

769
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,135
Then you drink it.
- I'll pour it on your head, I swear!

770
01:00:05,374 --> 01:00:07,733
You just want to die
to get me in trouble!

771
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:12,017
Not true, I'm not doing it to spite you.

772
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:18,558
But, really, what am I in this world for?
- What do you mean?

773
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:20,551
And being alive is nothing?

774
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,033
Excuse me, but do the trees ask
why they're in the world? - No.

775
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:28,530
And yet, they're here: pretty, leafy..
Look how leafy they are.

776
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:32,464
Do the daisies ask why
they're in this world? No!

777
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:36,650
The animals: chickens, hens,
goats, cows, horses!

778
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,698
And the mosquitoes! They spread malaria.
Do they ask why they're here?

779
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:45,891
Who knows?
- "Who knows"?

780
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,431
Look at me. Do you think
I ask why I'm in this world?

781
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,000
Well, you should.

782
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:55,598
Nobody asks that!

783
01:00:56,055 --> 01:00:58,960
Nor does the commissioner.
So why should you?

784
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,390
Damn it!

785
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:05,021
At least when you're dead, you won't
suffer anymore. - C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

786
01:01:05,146 --> 01:01:08,477
My child, look around you.
Look how beautiful nature is.

787
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:13,840
Of course: the air, sun, flowers, water..
Yes, yes!

788
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:19,844
Look, sweetie, see those birds above
with their wings, flying, chirping..

789
01:01:20,382 --> 01:01:22,030
They don't have it easy.

790
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,013
They must feed on bugs and worms. And
if they don't catch them, they're unhappy.

791
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,983
But when they do, life is beautiful
and they want to live forever..

792
01:01:31,906 --> 01:01:33,847
Poor little creature!

793
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:37,016
Jerk! What have you done?
- What do you mean?

794
01:01:37,086 --> 01:01:41,031
To run around the countryside
killing defenseless animals!

795
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:45,996
Excuse me, but what do you want from me?
- What do you mean, can't you see? Police!

796
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:50,085
Police? Fine, here's my permit.
- What do I care about a permit!

797
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:51,850
Give it here.
- It's in regulations!

798
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:53,200
Damn it!

799
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:58,460
Drink! Drink or I'll shoot!
- Shoot.

800
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:02,659
Oh, yeah? You'd like that, eh?
- Can you tell me what's going on?

801
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:05,651
The young lady is poisoned
and won't drink her milk!

802
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:10,494
Milk! The girl must vomit and right away!

803
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:15,000
He's right, that's true!
Come with me, eh! Come with me, eh!

804
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:30,832
Get in!

805
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,299
Come on, hurry!

806
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,415
Throw away that animal!
- Why? - Just because!

807
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:44,310
Hold on and close your eyes.
- Where are we going? - I know where.

808
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:37,200
<i>Stop!
- Stop, Sergeant!</i>

809
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,800
Let it out, Sergeant.
Soon you'll feel better, right?

810
01:03:56,229 --> 01:03:58,100
<i>Stop a sec, Sergeant!</i>

811
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:02,681
<i>The pork wasn't bad!
It was very fresh!</i>

812
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:06,599
<i>The cat died because it
swallowed a bumblebee!</i>

813
01:04:07,955 --> 01:04:09,599
Thank the Lord!

814
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,380
I've got something here!

815
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,891
I'm sorry, Sergeant, to get
you involved in this mess.

816
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,955
Why don't you let me leave?

817
01:04:21,863 --> 01:04:26,100
I can't.. I must deliver you..
- To whom?

818
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,500
How do I know?
Someone we'll find in your town.

819
01:04:31,396 --> 01:04:33,509
Who would ever care about me?

820
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,459
Don't worry, we'll find some fool.

821
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:41,149
Why do you act so?
Why do you give me such headaches?

822
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:46,363
I'm really going to all this
trouble for your future, aren't I?

823
01:04:47,156 --> 01:04:51,493
You're right, Sergeant.
I promise that I'll be good.

824
01:04:54,244 --> 01:04:56,875
You promise?
- Yes, I swear.

825
01:04:57,254 --> 01:05:00,558
You sure? - Yes.
But you'll see that no one wants me.

826
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,485
Forget it, don't worry.
Let me take care of it.

827
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:05,934
You'll see. Let's go now.

828
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,820
So this is your town.

829
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:14,653
We've finally arrived.

830
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:17,502
I'm thrilled.

831
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,073
And you, aren't you?
Come!

832
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:26,279
Be thrilled too, now that we're here.

833
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:40,400
Come, get down.
- Where are we going?

834
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:44,904
To see the monsignor, the priest
or whatever he's called here.

835
01:05:45,096 --> 01:05:46,605
Let's see what he says.

836
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:50,761
The ecclesiastical, pontifical,
parochial authority knows everything.

837
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,170
Then we'll see. Let's go.

838
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,095
Oh, heaven!

839
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,742
Here..

840
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:35,664
Reverend!

841
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:40,084
Oh, look who's here!

842
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:45,915
Ah, Carolina, Carolina,
you've given me so much trouble!

843
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:51,578
With your permission, Father.
- Please, stand up. Dear child..

844
01:06:55,837 --> 01:07:00,789
My dears.. are you already married
or is that why you came?

845
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:03,279
Monsignor, allow me to clear up a mistake.

846
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:06,051
I am Officer Antonio
Caccavallo from the city.

847
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,504
I'm here to escort the person present.

848
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:10,588
But what has she done now?

849
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:14,350
Streetwalking with aggravated suicide.

850
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,604
No!
- Yes.

851
01:07:15,674 --> 01:07:18,117
Allow me to be shocked.
- Permission granted.

852
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:21,693
How is it possible, my dear?
Why?

853
01:07:22,863 --> 01:07:25,601
What pushed you to this madness?

854
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,289
We've tried to understand it,
but it was impossible.

855
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:31,498
The girl..

856
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:34,150
is pertinacious!

857
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:38,100
No, no.
It's not possible, dear.

858
01:07:38,485 --> 01:07:40,779
Look at me, Carolina, look at me.

859
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,500
What happened? Tell me, what happened?

860
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,560
Are you expecting a baby?

861
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:54,382
Bravo, Bishop!
You guessed it first!

862
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:59,040
The commissioner was unable
to get one word out of her mouth.

863
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,402
And you hussy,
how dare you discuss naughty things

864
01:08:02,472 --> 01:08:05,430
with a prince of the ecclesiastical court?
Excuse me, Your Eminence.

865
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,013
Carolina!
Oh, Carolina!

866
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,234
Just think, I've known her since
she was this high. - Really? - Yes.

867
01:08:14,304 --> 01:08:16,180
That makes things easy then.

868
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,659
Do you have a pen, pencil or stylus?

869
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:23,850
It is done. - What is that?
- A receipt.

870
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,600
I hand the girl over to you,
you sign and I go.

871
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:31,692
But look.. that's not possible.
- How come?

872
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:36,550
It's a very serious thing.
Of high responsibility. - I know.

873
01:08:36,731 --> 01:08:39,431
We need to talk this over..
- All right, let's talk.

874
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:41,919
But what's to talk about, monsignor?

875
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:45,078
What a nice day!
The grapes are fine! The flood!

876
01:08:45,148 --> 01:08:47,891
But what counts is the signature.
One minute.

877
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,753
No, you see I'm not authorized. I can't.

878
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:55,136
I authorize you. I'm an officer and in
the name of law, you may sign. Got it?

879
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:58,679
Well, to be honest..

880
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,756
I must confess that young man..
- Ah, first things first.

881
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:06,027
You go confess that young
man and I'll wait for you.

882
01:09:06,097 --> 01:09:08,812
Good, dear, wait here.
- I await your return.

883
01:09:08,882 --> 01:09:12,805
Yes. And later we'll talk this
over more calmly. - Yes, Sir.

884
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:16,658
With great calm. - Yes, Sir.
- And you'll see, we'll work it all out.

885
01:09:16,728 --> 01:09:18,718
Wait, my dear.
- At your orders.

886
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,672
Come, let's go.

887
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:46,111
<i>No!</i>

888
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:05,100
<i>Go, go.</i>

889
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,410
Shall I arrest him? - What do
you mean? Let's go to the sacristy.

890
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:27,430
Mr..?
- Antonio Caccavallo, city officer.

891
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,974
What times! What times!
I'm shocked, deeply shocked.

892
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:33,907
I would've arrested him.

893
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:45,791
Come, dear.
You have to tell me everything.

894
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:48,500
Come, but sit down in your state.

895
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:56,348
Tell me, who was it? Who's the father?

896
01:10:56,722 --> 01:10:59,590
We'll find him. - I don't wanna see him!
- Go on!

897
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,960
Respond to his Eminence. Who was it?

898
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:08,368
No matter, my dear, no matter.
You'll see, we'll find him

899
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,731
and in the end everything will work out.

900
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:13,601
Sure, everything'll be OK.
This, for example.

901
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:17,685
You give me a little signature,
I leave the girl and go. All fixed!

902
01:11:17,755 --> 01:11:21,468
No, my son, I told you that
in my position, I couldn't.

903
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:24,581
But I have an idea
and you'll see that it's right.

904
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:30,298
Matteo, come here! Listen well to what
I'm going to say. You know the Barozzoli?

905
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:32,263
Broccoli?
- The Barozzoli!

906
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:36,133
I don't want to see them.
- Is there anyone you want to see? Heh?

907
01:11:36,337 --> 01:11:39,344
Excuse me.
- Easy, dear, easy. Let me do this.

908
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,491
Don't you know the Barozzoli?
- The Barozzoli..

909
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:46,191
Barozzoli!
Oh, sweet Jesus!

910
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:51,028
Come here, come here with me.
Let's see where they are.

911
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:54,000
Today is the game
and they don't go to that.

912
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,254
There they are in the fourth row.

913
01:11:57,324 --> 01:12:00,233
In the row, yes.
- Row? - Yes, the row.

914
01:12:00,409 --> 01:12:06,000
The fourth row, wait, next to the altar
of St Anna.. - Row? - Understand?

915
01:12:06,258 --> 01:12:08,312
Go call them. Go.
- Row..

916
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,458
Monsignor, that kid
move likes lightning, eh?

917
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:21,556
Tell me, tell me, excuse me..
these Broccoli.. - No, Barozzoli.

918
01:12:21,707 --> 01:12:24,931
These Barozzoli are the girl's relatives?
- Not exactly.

919
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:29,130
I won't see them!
- Ah, hah! Oh yes, we will! We will!

920
01:12:29,648 --> 01:12:34,472
They're not really relatives.
Sort of distant relatives. - Of course.

921
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:39,135
They took her in for many years
after she became orphaned.

922
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:43,086
I sent her to them.
Then she went crazy and ran away.

923
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:46,498
Let me go!
- Don't be a nut! Don't be a nut!

924
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,008
The Fartarozzis are good people!

925
01:12:49,195 --> 01:12:51,457
Behave. Leave it to me.

926
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:56,620
You'll see how the Barozzoli, as good
Christians, will welcome you back again.

927
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:58,721
Barozzoli!

928
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:02,464
Good day, Father.
- Salutations.

929
01:13:02,534 --> 01:13:07,034
My good dears, I've prepared
for you a nice surprise!

930
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,506
Thank you, Father!

931
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:12,083
A surprise that will fill
your hearts with joy.

932
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:13,910
Here she is.

933
01:13:15,405 --> 01:13:17,619
Some nice surprise!
There's nothing to say.

934
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:21,197
I'm surprised, Father,
you let her in a holy place!

935
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:25,931
We've been too good. But that slut
deserves neither pity nor mercy!

936
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,619
Right!
- Oh, yeah? - No!

937
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:30,490
I'm the slut because
I ran away with a boy!

938
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,900
Some tramp!

939
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:35,500
Yes, because her husband wanted
to get in my room at night!

940
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,420
The insolence!
- It's unheard of!

941
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:41,428
He's the dirty one, not me!
That's why I ran away with the driver!

942
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:44,891
One night, he wanted to come
into my room in his underwear.

943
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:46,581
How absurd!

944
01:13:46,873 --> 01:13:49,800
Allow me to express my dismay..
- You may.

945
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,719
Just a moment!
What is this story of the underwear? Eh?

946
01:13:52,789 --> 01:13:55,431
She's a viper!
She wants to besmirch my husband!

947
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:58,871
Goffredo, tell them!
- Defamation! Defamation, pure and simple!

948
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:01,466
Mr.. - How dare you?
- Mr. Goffredo!

949
01:14:01,722 --> 01:14:05,144
Sir! First you compromise
yourself and then protest!

950
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:10,981
My children..
- CHILDREN!

951
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:15,682
What "children"? We took in that wretch!
- Treated her like one of us!

952
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:18,761
We even gave her a meal
on Sundays, understand?

953
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,123
Enough! Enough!

954
01:14:21,272 --> 01:14:23,539
We're in a sacristy. Shame on you!

955
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,980
May I be shocked?

956
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:28,931
Father! You get shocked every 5 minutes!

957
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:33,189
Stop being shocked and impose your
ecclesiastical authority on these people!

958
01:14:33,259 --> 01:14:36,970
And make them do their duty and
bring the girl home! - Yes, you're right.

959
01:14:37,142 --> 01:14:42,981
Regarding Carolina's accusations,
we'll settle accounts in confession.

960
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:48,378
But now Christian charity requires
that you bring this poor girl home.

961
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:52,557
Especially now that she's pregnant.
- How shameful!

962
01:14:56,718 --> 01:14:58,097
Everybody, halt!

963
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:03,181
Police! Article 212 requires
you to take the girl home.

964
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:07,000
That article doesn't exist! I'm a lawyer.
- Oh, yeah? Then it's article 213!

965
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:10,190
Neither does that one!
- Never mind. - Let's go!

966
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:14,870
Lawyer! - What?
- What about 217?

967
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:18,583
Go to hell!
- Drop dead! Oh, sorry, Father.

968
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:21,167
The alms..
- So annoying! Get it away!

969
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,187
Apologies, Monsignor.

970
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:29,929
How shameful, how shameful!
Before a foreigner!

971
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:34,415
Who knows what he'll think of us!
- He only thinks of drinking and eating.

972
01:15:35,391 --> 01:15:40,046
No, dear, we have nothing. We don't
even have Christian charity. Go on.

973
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,731
What now?
- Now we look for the driver.

974
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:49,708
The driver you escaped with,
it was him, wasn't it?

975
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:53,150
Yeah, but forget it, it's no use.

976
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,250
No use? Let me talk to him,
we'll see then if it's any use.

977
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,867
You were a minor when you left.

978
01:15:57,937 --> 01:16:01,351
I didn't know he was a liar.
- What do you mean, my child?

979
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:06,037
I thought he was good but he's married
and has 3 kids. - Oh, Jesus, Jesus!

980
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:19,469
Monsignor, what are we gonna do?

981
01:16:19,539 --> 01:16:23,478
You know what I say? - Let me say it:
You're shocked. - No.- I would've bet on it.

982
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:27,031
Maybe it's better this way.
The Lord has decided otherwise.

983
01:16:27,358 --> 01:16:32,131
Ah, yes? And, exceptionally,
couldn't we know what the Lord decided?

984
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:36,508
Uncle Francesco! - Uncle Francesco?
You said she had no relatives..

985
01:16:36,674 --> 01:16:42,101
He's not really a relative, distantly
related. - Fine, a relative is a relative.

986
01:16:42,171 --> 01:16:44,361
He doesn't want me either.
- Don't talk so.

987
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:49,481
It's been a while since you've seen him.
To Uncle Francesco! - To Uncle Francesco!

988
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:52,642
Let's go.
- Let's go. Come.

989
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,563
Just as well.

990
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:58,072
Carolina needs a place to stay.
You know what I say?

991
01:16:58,142 --> 01:17:00,802
No, what do you say?
- I'm shocked, Mr. Antonio.

992
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:06,690
Uncle Francesco had adopted Robertino,
the son of his dead brother in Australia.

993
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,493
You've been disappointed, eh?

994
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:18,802
What is it? - New sins.
-Tomorrow, tomorrow. I've got work to do.

995
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:24,322
You'll see with your own eyes, the great
love that uncle has for the poor orphan.

996
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:45,527
# Back and forth, back and forth,
that's all there is in life.

997
01:17:45,597 --> 01:17:49,431
# Back and forth, back and forth,
what great fun it is!

998
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:52,283
# Back and forth, back and forth,
that's all there is in life.

999
01:17:52,353 --> 01:17:55,431
Will you shut up?
- Don't you like it, Sergeant?

1000
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:59,121
It's an old song, called "Back and forth".
- Don't be a smartass.

1001
01:17:59,993 --> 01:18:04,000
Don't be angry, Sergeant.
You can't go against fate, I say.

1002
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,300
If you had arrived at Villa Borghese
ten minutes later, we'd both be all set.

1003
01:18:08,743 --> 01:18:09,797
I wish!

1004
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:14,861
You shouldn't say that, Sergeant.
- You're right.

1005
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,250
But I've had such bad luck.

1006
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,056
I had to stumble on just you,
not a thief.

1007
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,270
Did I say thief?

1008
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:30,230
In a 15 year career, I haven't seen any.
Never. At the movies, I see many.

1009
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:35,772
But a real thief, a criminal,
an atomic spy.. nothing!

1010
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:39,277
And now you come and goodbye promotion.

1011
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:45,030
Do you know, girl, how much you cost me?
9,000 lire a month!

1012
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:48,907
Over a 100,000 lire per year!
- Is that my fault?

1013
01:18:49,852 --> 01:18:52,817
It's Fate that causes encounters.
- A fine encounter!

1014
01:18:52,998 --> 01:18:54,200
A stinker!

1015
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:09,834
I'm amazed at you, Sarge!

1016
01:19:09,904 --> 01:19:13,704
Me? There's a jerk in the back
who signaled! - Who's in the back?

1017
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,800
Let's go get him, he must be a thief.
- Sergeant!

1018
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,400
Damn you! Don't move..

1019
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,871
Everybody freeze! Hands up! Hold it!

1020
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:28,631
What did you steal? Eh?
- I'm not the thief, I'm the owner!

1021
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:31,858
Boys, don't play around.
Who's the thief? - He is!

1022
01:19:31,928 --> 01:19:36,203
No, Sergeant. The box was falling down
and I was picking it up. - Come with me!

1023
01:19:36,273 --> 01:19:39,795
You're making a blunder, Sergeant.
- At last a thief! Come with me!

1024
01:19:39,865 --> 01:19:41,465
I never make blunders.

1025
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:55,193
Why did he arrest you?
- Because I wanted to kill myself.

1026
01:19:55,364 --> 01:19:59,031
What? One can't even kill oneself!
- They say it's illegal.

1027
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:01,958
Some republic! Very nice!

1028
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:06,700
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm
Mario Tanzi, but call me Marietto Cellar.

1029
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,730
Nice to meet you. Carolina De Vico.

1030
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,800
Why "Cellar"? - Because for a month,
I've been hiding in a basement.

1031
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:19,373
Does he have a gun?
- Yes, but he's very nice, poor thing.

1032
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:23,293
I feel bad because they might fire him.

1033
01:20:23,363 --> 01:20:25,652
Is that true, Sergeant?
- Shut up!

1034
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:29,191
If he can't leave me with anyone
they might fire him.

1035
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:32,950
Oh yeah? He hasn't found anyone?
- No one wants me.

1036
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:36,868
Sarge! I'll take her if you let me go.

1037
01:20:36,938 --> 01:20:39,888
To my house, there's Mom.
It's an honest family.

1038
01:20:40,026 --> 01:20:41,942
You'd really take me with you?

1039
01:20:42,012 --> 01:20:45,010
Look at my face.
Marietto Cellar is a man of his word.

1040
01:20:46,736 --> 01:20:48,936
But I already made a mistake once.

1041
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,350
Would you also take a baby?

1042
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:57,120
Ah, I made a ton of mistakes.
We got to look past that or we're cooked.

1043
01:20:58,398 --> 01:21:01,539
Sergeant, let her go
and you'll save your job.

1044
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:05,700
Sergeant! If you let me go
I promise not to kill myself anymore.

1045
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,479
We'll rebuild our lives together.

1046
01:21:10,091 --> 01:21:14,445
I'll support him, he'll support me,
we'll support each other...

1047
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:16,415
And I'm the one who'll fall!

1048
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,876
How can you trust such a scoundrel?
I don't get it.

1049
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,235
Sergeant..

1050
01:21:22,535 --> 01:21:24,954
I can't afford to be so picky, right?

1051
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:29,000
Besides, I think he's a good guy.

1052
01:21:30,526 --> 01:21:33,200
Don't you think it's a sign from Fate?

1053
01:21:39,665 --> 01:21:43,006
Damn it.
Why does everything happen to me?

1054
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,700
Everything!

1055
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:48,350
Check this out: the tire blew!

1056
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,018
Damn it all to hell!

1057
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:59,730
What are you looking at?

1058
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:09,634
You're letting me go? - Quiet!
Get out and change the tire.

1059
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:13,482
Why? It's not my car.
- Young man, don't you want to chip in?

1060
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:19,431
That's why I'm a thief. - Bad! Obey!
Do as I say. It's in your best interest.

1061
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:23,510
The Sergeant is right, eh?
Change the tire. Hurry up.

1062
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,572
Quick!
- Quick? I'm very weak.

1063
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:29,858
Then you'll let me go?
- Let you go? Let you go?

1064
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:33,045
Don't you know policemen
can't allow a thief to escape?

1065
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,831
If he's smart, he'll manage.
Move it, get the tools.

1066
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:38,605
Yeah, and be shot in the back!
- Nonsense!

1067
01:22:38,675 --> 01:22:41,131
Uh, kids, I'm going..
you give him a hand.

1068
01:22:41,201 --> 01:22:45,155
I'll be on that low wall.
I'm going to clean my gun.

1069
01:22:46,036 --> 01:22:47,934
I'll unload it for cleaning.

1070
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:57,647
Now, I take out the magazine.

1071
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,703
Hey.
Hey! Hey!

1072
01:23:11,209 --> 01:23:14,457
Come on, let's run.
- Are you crazy? He'll shoot us.

1073
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:18,826
Shoot? Didn't you hear he's taking out
the bullets? - I don't trust him.

1074
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:21,800
The gun is unloaded..

1075
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:26,313
Hey, look. He has no more bullets.
- He's just teasing us.

1076
01:23:26,383 --> 01:23:29,670
We try to run and get a year more.
I'm not an idiot.

1077
01:23:30,148 --> 01:23:34,615
Well? What are you doing?
- Cranking the car up.

1078
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:37,760
Will you be long?
- 10 or 15 minutes, Sergeant.

1079
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,864
Hurry up, OK?
What are you waiting for?

1080
01:23:41,756 --> 01:23:42,882
Be fast.

1081
01:23:45,182 --> 01:23:50,830
Meanwhile, I'll take off my shoes.
Because my feet hurt, and I can't run!

1082
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:57,757
What are we waiting for? The gun is empty,
his feet hurt and the car can't move.

1083
01:23:57,892 --> 01:24:02,100
I know policemen, they're jerks!
Assholes! They want to get you!

1084
01:24:52,475 --> 01:24:55,181
Help! - Are you crazy?
What have you done, wretch?

1085
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:58,036
I'm sorry, Sergeant,
it was all her fault!

1086
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:01,031
Aren't we going to your home?
- My home? You crazy?

1087
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:04,895
But you promised me, that's why I did it!
- I promised you nothing!

1088
01:25:04,965 --> 01:25:07,977
Wait for me!
- Police! Arrest them!

1089
01:25:08,047 --> 01:25:10,888
Stop! Wait!
- My cranium!

1090
01:25:12,643 --> 01:25:16,920
Ai, yi, my noggin!
Ooh, my noggin! Ai, yi!

1091
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,796
Oh, God, what a blow!
I need a wet compress!

1092
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:26,630
A wet compress for my head!

1093
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:31,230
What..? What are you doing?
Come here, no flinging!

1094
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:32,523
Stop!

1095
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:36,846
Stop!
Wretch!

1096
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:42,059
Watch out for the water! The water!

1097
01:25:43,184 --> 01:25:46,767
Oh, my God! - Help! Help!
- Sergeant, give me your hand.

1098
01:25:46,837 --> 01:25:50,637
I'm drowning with a headache! Help!
- No, Sergeant, here! - Help!

1099
01:25:50,903 --> 01:25:52,377
Grab this, Sarge!

1100
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:55,792
Pull.. pull it!
- Don't worry! - Pull harder!

1101
01:25:55,862 --> 01:25:58,383
Come on!
- A lifesaver would be best.

1102
01:26:02,177 --> 01:26:03,989
We're sinking! Help!

1103
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:15,449
What's the matter with you?

1104
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:19,507
You've been crying for an hour.

1105
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:27,923
I'm crying because I'm miserable.
Very miserable.

1106
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:32,501
Not even a thief wants me. Not even him.

1107
01:26:33,486 --> 01:26:36,619
Yeah.. you're a wretch, you.

1108
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:40,900
Not me, on the other hand,
I'm so lucky!

1109
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,098
The vehicle broke down,
a new uniform thrown away,

1110
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:54,573
in poor health, perhaps with pulmonary
bronchitis suspecting the worst,

1111
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:56,630
a broken head...

1112
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,770
Ah, how happy I am!
How I rejoice!

1113
01:27:02,262 --> 01:27:03,700
What joy!

1114
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:07,492
I swear, Sergeant..
I meant no harm.

1115
01:27:08,984 --> 01:27:11,789
When I wanted to hold back,
my hand slipped!

1116
01:27:12,985 --> 01:27:15,669
I'm obviously a criminal, you were right.

1117
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:18,612
Well, well..
let's not exaggerate.

1118
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:21,457
Eh.. one blow more, one blow less.

1119
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:24,430
But it was a hard one.
Did you see?

1120
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,692
No, I didn't see it..

1121
01:27:27,636 --> 01:27:28,933
But I felt it.

1122
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,075
And you've been so nice..

1123
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:35,530
Nice! Gimme a break!

1124
01:27:35,976 --> 01:27:38,588
I'm bad!
Wicked!

1125
01:27:39,247 --> 01:27:40,430
I'm a plague!

1126
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:44,593
But you tried to save me
risking your own life. Like a father.

1127
01:27:44,663 --> 01:27:47,539
Oh, yeah?
And why do you think I did it?

1128
01:27:49,236 --> 01:27:51,157
Because you felt sorry for me.

1129
01:27:51,227 --> 01:27:53,526
For you? Sorry?

1130
01:27:53,596 --> 01:27:57,767
In my state... eh?
The only one I feel sorry for is me!

1131
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:02,285
For me! Because if you kill
yourself, I'll be fired.

1132
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:06,231
And I'll be out of work.
That's right, unemployed.

1133
01:28:06,767 --> 01:28:11,349
I'll be one of those going down the street
with a sign that says: "Bread and Work".

1134
01:28:11,949 --> 01:28:13,800
And they'll whack me on the head.

1135
01:28:14,124 --> 01:28:19,136
That is what I'll become: from one who
gives whacks to one who gets whacks.

1136
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,179
I was hoping you had
a little compassion for me.

1137
01:28:24,249 --> 01:28:28,000
You know what career I'd had
if I were sorry for every criminal I met?

1138
01:28:29,686 --> 01:28:34,514
So if the world is as ugly as you say..
I was right to want to leave it.

1139
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:37,913
Oh, God.. maybe.. you're right.

1140
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,890
But in this situation, you can't.

1141
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,949
You would get me in trouble..

1142
01:28:43,377 --> 01:28:46,993
Not counting..
the baby you're carrying.

1143
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:50,374
So?
- So, you can't. It's prohibited.

1144
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:54,226
You can't kill yourself.
Even I thought about it myself.

1145
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:58,126
But you can't. Because we're never alone
in life. There's always someone else.

1146
01:28:58,196 --> 01:28:59,946
Always some "appendixes".

1147
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:03,563
I, for example, have a father
and son to take care of.

1148
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,154
By the way, don't forget
to buy your father's wine.

1149
01:29:07,224 --> 01:29:09,006
See? See?

1150
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:14,074
If I kill myself,
how can my father drink wine, eh?

1151
01:29:14,501 --> 01:29:17,014
Suicide isn't for us.
We're poor people.

1152
01:29:17,236 --> 01:29:21,302
Suicide is a rich man's game.
It's a luxury.

1153
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:23,731
And those luxuries, we can't afford.

1154
01:29:23,801 --> 01:29:26,090
Do you understand? We are poor.

1155
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:32,752
I understand, Sergeant.

1156
01:29:39,913 --> 01:29:42,493
From now on,
you won't have to worry about me.

1157
01:29:43,773 --> 01:29:46,000
Goodbye.
- What are you doing?

1158
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,600
You've been good enough to me.

1159
01:29:54,115 --> 01:29:56,325
Don't trouble yourself anymore, Sarge.

1160
01:29:56,904 --> 01:29:59,130
I don't want to cause you harm again.

1161
01:30:01,412 --> 01:30:04,159
Tell the commissioner that
you left me in my town.

1162
01:30:06,298 --> 01:30:09,189
And I promise not to kill myself.

1163
01:30:10,161 --> 01:30:11,711
How will you survive?

1164
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,040
Don't animals survive?
I will too.

1165
01:30:18,467 --> 01:30:22,581
Oh, no!
You won't fool me with your promises!

1166
01:30:22,778 --> 01:30:27,330
I'm telling the truth this time, Sergeant.
- I know what I'm doing, got it?

1167
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,363
Now, I know what to do with you.
Let's go.

1168
01:30:31,746 --> 01:30:34,705
Let's go!
Move it.

1169
01:30:36,694 --> 01:30:41,017
Know that Officer Antonio Caccavallo
feels pity for no one! Let's go.

1170
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:48,709
Come in.

1171
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,613
Ah, it's you? How did it go?

1172
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:59,118
Sir, everything in order.
- Thank goodness. You took a load off me.

1173
01:30:59,259 --> 01:31:01,476
Who did you give her to?
- Some guy..

1174
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:05,364
A serious person? A good person?
- Too much so.

1175
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:07,270
What?
- A widower.

1176
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:11,450
That's really good. Why did he do it?
- He doesn't even know himself.

1177
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,207
Maybe out of compassion..
and maybe his home needed a woman.

1178
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:20,345
Well, anyway, we made it!
- Actually, Sir, I haven't made it yet...

1179
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:25,215
Eh, don't look like that.
This time you did a good job.

1180
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:27,764
As to the promotion, don't worry.

1181
01:31:27,834 --> 01:31:32,091
Really? I can consider myself.. eh?
- Certainly.

1182
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:35,735
Thank you, Sir.
The Caccavallos really needed that.

1183
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:39,521
9000 lire more a month
doesn't hurt anybody, eh?

1184
01:31:39,591 --> 01:31:43,971
You deserve it.
Didn't I say we'd find a fool?

1185
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,299
You were so right!
That fool was found.

1186
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:49,340
At your service, Sir.
- Go on.

1187
01:32:37,362 --> 01:32:41,153
Did you buy everything? - Yes.
- The socks? The notebook? - Yes, all.

1188
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:44,824
Well, let's go. - Where are we going?
- To a fool's house.

1189
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:08,973
