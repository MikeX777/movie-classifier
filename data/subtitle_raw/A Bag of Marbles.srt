1
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:10,921
AUGUST 1944

2
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,257
A BAG OF MARBLES

3
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:18,748
Everything is the same.

4
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,225
And yet...everything seems smaller.

5
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,141
Or I've grown up.

6
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,510
But how long has it been now?
Two and a half years?

7
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,381
Is it for today or for tomorrow?

8
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,725
This is my favorite marble...

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,766
Come on, Grouile!

10
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,707
Stop bugging me, I'm concentrating.

11
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,301
- Shit.
- Still wrong.

12
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:12,845
You are too incompetent.

13
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,497
Come on, we're gonna be late.

14
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:21,888
Keep your marble.

15
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,558
Stop crying.
Come on, hurry up.

16
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,610
We'll be late.
I'm not crying.

17
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:29,812
Yes, you are right. You don't cry.

18
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,583
I'm not crying.

19
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,725
It is not just because of its
technological superiority,

20
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,566
that Hitler's army is advancing rapidly.

21
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,878
Excuse me for the delay.

22
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,096
You'll see me after class.

23
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,687
So not by the
technological superiority,

24
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,579
but mostly thanks to the
morality of the German people...

25
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,617
who believe that their
destiny is to lead Europe.

26
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:12,133
That's not from
yesterday or today, is it...

27
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,125
Already under Karel... Zerati!

28
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,779
Give me that piece of paper.

29
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,333
Come on little boy...

30
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,308
"I hold my mistresses,
even those of others."

31
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,308
Very funny.

32
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,725
But full of mistakes.

33
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,073
Did you write that?

34
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,268
- Bah. ..
- He's stupid enough to to pass it on,

35
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,339
but not smart enough
to write it down, sir.

36
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,826
Silence. Silence.

37
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,407
You will write out

38
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:41,756
50 times the motto of the Maréchal.

39
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,109
And do not forget the "S" after "celles".

40
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,469
Come on, Zerati. To your place.

41
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:50,760
Here!

42
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:54,463
Here!

43
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,308
Do you want another one?

44
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,257
I got you.
Right on your ass!

45
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,933
Take this !

46
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,808
Just wait...

47
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,599
- Get your guard up.
- You, you gonna stick one?

48
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,919
You're dreaming, mosquito.

49
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,383
Look. I have an idea.

50
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,523
Could he choose?

51
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,023
To cut?

52
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,188
Haircut?

53
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,236
Albert!
Take care of Monsieur.

54
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:37,628
Hello.

55
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:38,736
Hello.

56
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,892
What can I do for you ?

57
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,042
They haven't seen anything...

58
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,128
Cut my hair.

59
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:53,058
With pleasure. Take a seat.

60
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,351
You're welcome.

61
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,100
Go ahead.
We'll take your coats.

62
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,266
Short on the neck?

63
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,268
Please. And a trim
on the left for my colleague.

64
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:15,182
No problem.
He does not speak French well.

65
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,475
He understands a little, huh?

66
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,706
Yes.

67
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,216
But you speak very good French.

68
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:25,612
Not really. But I will
try it to speak better.

69
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,404
That is only a matter of time.

70
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,847
I'll be back later.

71
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:36,346
Until next time, Mr. Levi...

72
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,834
Mr. Léviyard.

73
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,370
It's okay.
It's on the house, Mr Léviyard.

74
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,362
Are they yours,
the two little boys?

75
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,183
Yes.

76
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,893
The older ones too.

77
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:54,400
These little rascals are always
ready to make the 400 shots.

78
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,992
Ah, the war...

79
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,187
Terrible business, isn't it?

80
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:03,474
It depends for whom...

81
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:06,495
It's because of the Jews.

82
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:13,510
Here. Nice and short.

83
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,133
Satisfied?

84
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:23,850
Thank you.

85
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,503
- Do you like it?
- Yes. Very good.

86
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,354
Know, gentlemen,
that here, in this salon,

87
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:33,315
everybody is Jewish.

88
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:01,664
Oh, I almost had it.

89
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:05,125
Come on, get into bed.

90
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,031
No no! In bed, kids!
We stop acting like idiots.

91
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,689
Let go of your brother. Stop!
Go to bed.

92
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:12,992
Yawohl, My Commander!
- In bed. No whining.

93
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,159
- Yawohl!
- That's right, yes.

94
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,205
You want to act like your brother.
Calm down, darling.

95
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,760
Your father told me
what you did today.

96
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:23,628
Don't do that again, okay ?

97
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,282
Those Germans
are not here to laugh.

98
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,573
Ja! Sehr gut!

99
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,065
Sehr gut!

100
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,901
Did you laugh?
Yes.

101
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,424
You had them by the nose.

102
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,409
Yes. You're too strong, Papa.

103
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,297
It's not a matter of strength.
You answered them.

104
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,648
The question is what can you do about it.

105
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,766
Maybe soon, you can't
say nothing more.

106
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:43,422
Perhaps.

107
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:46,102
But in the meantime, we
are "dignity, justice and pride",

108
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,372
As your grandfather used to say.

109
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:48,683
grandpa Jacob.

110
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:50,834
In bed !

111
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,433
Aren't you too old for that nonsense?

112
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:57,730
No.

113
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,058
No? Well, me neither.

114
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:04,042
Stop! They have to
go to school tomorrow!

115
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,474
Stop!

116
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,433
But you're crazy?

117
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,562
MAY 1942

118
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:20,847
Come on, Grouil. Come!

119
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,974
If Maman sees us
smoking, we're in shit.

120
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,290
Why do you say "us"?

121
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,455
<i>The Jewish star has 6 points,</i>

122
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>the size of the palm of your hand
with outlines in black.</i>

123
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:43,194
<i>It is made of yellow fabric and in
black the letters JEW are written on it.</i>

124
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,570
<i>It must be clearly visible and
worn on the left side of the chest</i>

125
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,383
<i>firmly sewn to the clothing.</i>

126
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,187
Listen, Maman.

127
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,680
<i>Penalties:</i>

128
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:56,734
<i>Failure to follow this order will be
punishable by imprisonment and fines.</i>

129
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>This can be extended
with or being replaced by...</i>

130
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,807
<i>admission to a Jewish camp.</i>

131
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,430
Do you know what that means?

132
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:05,986
There's nothing more we can do,
don't go out anymore.

133
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,127
We don't have to stay here.

134
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,322
We'll ask Papa what he thinks.

135
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,572
It's like a medal, isn't it?

136
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,225
They mark us, like
in the Middle Ages.

137
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,017
Shut up, Henri. That's enough.

138
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,433
Mother, listen to me.

139
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,690
Albert and I made our decision.
We'll leave tomorrow.

140
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,516
Where to?
You're not gonna leave like that.

141
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,127
Do you think they are taking revenge
for what happened in the salon?

142
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,263
No, I don't think so.

143
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,017
Especially you:
keep your head up.

144
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,946
Hey, he's also a Jew.

145
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,894
Good, see you later.

146
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,285
He is Jewish...

147
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:20,182
You don't have to frequent it.

148
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,940
Why are you looking
at me like that?

149
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,948
I didn't know you were Jewish.

150
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,182
So what? What does it matter?

151
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,200
That changes everything.

152
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:32,236
- Oh yeah? What then?
- That means you're a Youpin.

153
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,307
A Youpin.

154
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:39,143
It is you who have crucified
the little Jesus.

155
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,388
That's it, it was I
who crucified him,

156
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:43,266
- Asshole.
- Asshole yourself.

157
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,516
He denies it, with his Jewish blood.

158
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,135
What's wrong with my blood?
Is it not the same as yesterday?

159
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,682
It's because of the Jews
that the Germans are here.

160
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,330
- Take that back.
- In your dreams!

161
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,542
That's what you deserve.

162
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,925
Well, mosquitoes...
Do you want to fight?

163
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,893
Because hitting is what I prefer.

164
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,065
Is that Youpin causing problems for you?

165
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,674
Who's a mosquito now?

166
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:20,641
Gentlemen, come on!

167
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,964
In a line!

168
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,402
Go inside!

169
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,892
I want to speak with you.
In my office!

170
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,268
I hit him with my right.

171
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,802
Not really, no...

172
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:36,917
I can defend myself.

173
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:38,608
Wait, Joffo!

174
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,542
- Well, are things getting better?
- Bof

175
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,050
Show me your star.

176
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,464
Here, I'll trade it for
my bag of marbles.

177
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,964
What are you talking about ?

178
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,745
Your star, I trade it
for my bag of marbles.

179
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,808
Are you sure about that, Zerati?

180
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,573
Yes, I told you.
I like it, your star.

181
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,932
Look, there's plenty in there.

182
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,268
Good. Okay.

183
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:15,215
But I warn you, be careful.
It's not just a star.

184
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:18,940
It is also a target.
Do not worry. Thank you.

185
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:20,987
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

186
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,534
Hey! Go ahead.
Give it back.

187
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:25,545
You made a great deal.

188
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,975
Come on, Grouille.
Otherwise we're gonna get banged up again.

189
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,067
Hello 'pa.

190
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,497
Hurry up, mother is waiting for you.

191
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,808
Maman! I don't have any homework today.

192
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,333
Sit down, kids.

193
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
Come on, eat up. It's going to get cold.

194
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,173
Is there a problem?

195
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,948
I will tell you a story that happened
to grandpa Jacob and me.

196
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,292
A long time ago,
in our village in Russia,

197
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,541
There were riots against the Jews.

198
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,958
There were called "the pogroms".

199
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,175
It became very difficult to stay.

200
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,825
My father came to talk to me.

201
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,807
He told me that I had
to leave, alone,

202
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,499
To save my life.

203
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,458
And that's what I did.

204
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,776
And today...

205
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,217
Is it our turn?

206
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,666
Yes.

207
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
And when?

208
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,169
Tonight.

209
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,760
Henri and Albert left this morning
for the free zone.

210
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,417
They will be waiting for you in Nice,
at my friend Saul Levine's house.

211
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,331
And why don't we stay together?

212
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,624
Because that's too dangerous.
We would be noticed.

213
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,385
It's better to separate.

214
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,120
No one will be suspicious
of two little boys.

215
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,065
- And you ?
- We'll leave tomorrow.

216
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,737
Time to close everything.
Next week, we'll all be in Nice.

217
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,049
Good?

218
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,323
So, look...

219
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,128
You're going to the free zone
via Hagetmau.

220
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,151
This is the safest route.

221
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,995
Find the ferryman in Hagetmau.

222
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,081
He works in a restaurant
with blue shutters.

223
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:36,190
Beware, there are many scammers out there.

224
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,783
Papa made a list with the stations,

225
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:39,917
the tickets,

226
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,916
points of passage and the appointments.

227
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,291
Memorize it by heart.

228
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,583
No one should see you
with these papers. Never. Okay ?

229
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:48,709
I'll put it in your bag.

230
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:53,586
That's 200,000 francs...

231
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,190
for trains and buses.

232
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:00,017
You will leave Austerlitz railway
station directly to Irun.

233
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,737
- Did you write that down?
- Yes.

234
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,583
Give me that.

235
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,997
The most important:

236
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,517
You must swear to
me that you will never say

237
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:10,874
to anyone that you are Jewish.

238
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,666
Under any circumstances.

239
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,083
We must be proud of who we are.

240
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,649
But today, it is too dangerous.

241
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,416
And it's not cowardice.

242
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,708
I swear.

243
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,865
Promise.

244
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,750
Jo.

245
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,177
Are you Jewish?

246
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,474
No.

247
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,663
- Are you a Jew?
- No.

248
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,522
Never answer when someone
talks to you in Yiddish.

249
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:42,104
Tell me you're a Jew.

250
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,374
I know you're a Jew.
Tell me the truth.

251
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:47,934
Tell me the truth.

252
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,663
I know you're Jewish!

253
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,250
- Are you Jewish?
- No.

254
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,311
- Yes, you're Jewish.
- No !

255
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:56,208
- I know you're a Jew!
- No, I'm not Jewish!

256
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,750
Excuse me, Jojo.

257
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:11,424
Sorry.

258
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,458
Better take a slap that hurts...

259
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:20,109
than you lose your life
because you are afraid of a blow.

260
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,249
Do you understand, my Jojo?

261
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,249
I'm not a Jew.

262
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,666
Come on.
Come on.

263
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,583
Come on, get dressed darling.
Come here.

264
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,541
Come.

265
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,166
Come on.

266
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:54,764
I love you.

267
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,167
Lets' go.

268
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,416
No nonsense, eh?

269
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,375
Hey.

270
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,950
Don't worry. With this money
I'll buy you a ton of marbles.

271
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,333
For real?

272
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,541
You're dreaming, dude.

273
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,958
Come on, come on.

274
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,541
It will be fine.

275
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:10,125
Train to Dax,
is about to depart.

276
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:13,250
Please move away from
the edge of the track.

277
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,666
There is no room left.

278
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,541
The children...
Let the kids go first.

279
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,291
It's full.

280
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,374
Excuse me.

281
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,416
Sorry. Thank you.

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Sorry.

283
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:31,672
Sorry.

284
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Excuse me.

285
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:41,529
Excuse me, can we sit here?

286
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,429
Of course.

287
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:43,343
Thank you.

288
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,398
Excuse me.

289
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,999
- Do you think they are fleeing like us?
- How would I know?

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,833
I dunno.

291
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:00,833
We're going to Dax.

292
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,583
And then to the south.

293
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,124
It had started. We had left.

294
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,975
Our first night without parents.

295
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,916
What exactly were we fleeing from?

296
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,875
Jo. Jo, wake up.
We have a problem.

297
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,458
Honey, hurry up.

298
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,291
What is happening ?

299
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,533
Where is everyone going?

300
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:01,142
I don't know. There are many
jumping out before stopping.

301
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,708
Come.

302
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:26,876
Paper...

303
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,833
Psst.

304
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,916
We have no papers Father.

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,250
If you radiate fear, they
will notice. So don't be afraid.

306
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:44,665
Thank you.

307
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:52,755
Identification card!

308
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,416
Eat that.

309
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:04,567
Follow us.

310
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,458
Follow us.
Stay calm.

311
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,750
Your papers.

312
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,458
Papers.

313
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,416
I don't understand German.

314
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:28,788
Fritz!

315
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:30,382
She's for you.

316
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,882
Is there a problem, sir?"

317
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,265
- So, grandma, come with me.
- Papers?

318
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,250
Go.

319
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:46,921
Thank you.

320
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,672
Identification card! Now!

321
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,000
Papers.

322
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,542
Yes,

323
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,108
I have lost a lot of
weight, but it is me.

324
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,101
Faster!

325
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,686
"Gott mit uns."

326
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:20,874
God is with you.

327
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,333
That is beautiful.

328
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,167
With us all, by the way.

329
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:26,374
Hey, kids?

330
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,765
The children belong to me.

331
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:45,241
Good. Thank you.

332
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:47,077
Paper?

333
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,236
Paper?

334
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,375
We're going, we're going.

335
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,632
You come with us.

336
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,507
- There must be a mistake!
- You have to come.

337
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,546
Let me go.
No, I do not want to follow you.

338
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,791
What are they doing
with that grandmother?

339
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:09,358
Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
Quick or we'll miss the bus.

340
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,032
A moment please.

341
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,062
Thank you Father
that you lied for us.

342
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:23,290
I didn't lie. All children
in the world belong to me.

343
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,241
That's all. Go now.

344
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:26,365
Hurry up.
Hey, psst.

345
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,772
Don't trust anyone, okay?

346
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:31,405
And smile a little.

347
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,515
You don't get apples every day.

348
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,166
Good luck.

349
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,694
Come on. Let's go.

350
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,116
We're following them.

351
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:12,108
There's still a spot in the back.
Follow me.

352
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:14,256
Come on, come on.

353
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,507
Did you see it? There are
many people in that restaurant.

354
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:31,599
Did you see ? They are
also looking for the ferryman.

355
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,616
If we stay here we're
sure to get caught.

356
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,458
Hey, you looking for a ferryman?

357
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,444
No, I'm fine.

358
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,366
The ferryman comes here at
eight o'clock to pick up people.

359
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,417
His name is Bronchet.
He asks 10,000 francs per person.

360
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,499
20000 francs!

361
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,708
Ergh... yes.

362
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:58,608
With me, it would be cheaper,
but you're not looking for a ferryman.

363
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,194
How much would it cost?
Just for example...

364
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:09,203
Let's say...
1000 per person, without negotiation.

365
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,289
And with negotiations?

366
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,155
See you later, Parisians.

367
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,398
We can pay.

368
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:16,429
Well, what do you know?

369
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:20,819
Good. You give me half now
and the rest on arrival.

370
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:33,693
Agreement concluded.

371
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,733
Good.

372
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:40,417
I will continue with my delivery
round first, then I'll poke a trout...

373
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:44,725
and we'll meet on that corner
of the street when night falls.

374
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,280
We're not leaving now?
Oh no.

375
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:50,132
That's too dangerous.
Okay, see you later!

376
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:54,000
- My name is Raymond.
- Hi, Raymond. Me, it's Jo.

377
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,257
That man was nice, isn't he?

378
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,771
- "Hey Raymond, I'm Jo."
- That will cost us a thousand marbles!

379
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,658
You're joking?
We just saved 18,000.

380
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,500
We're better off here
than in Clignancourt, huh?

381
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,417
Yes, we certainly are.

382
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,653
- I'm going to pee.
- Yes.

383
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,239
Come on.

384
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,375
Come on little one. Come!

385
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,437
Watch out. The Germans!

386
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,083
- I got you.
- Shit.

387
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,453
Your cock is circumcised, isn't it, 'little boy'.

388
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:52,016
- "Jew, you are."
- You're stupid.

389
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,968
You pissed on it.

390
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:56,221
Come on, come on.

391
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,438
No, no you're not wiping it on me.

392
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,750
It's almost dark.
What the hell is he doing?

393
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,520
There's no one here anymore.

394
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,320
He went to poke a trout,
didn't you hear that?

395
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,875
And what does that mean?

396
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,249
It sounds disgusting.

397
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,062
I have no idea.

398
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,695
We got ourselves conned by Raymond.
Papa had warned us.

399
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,624
Quick!

400
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:56,772
Don't move.

401
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:00,250
Get down.

402
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,583
Look...

403
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,458
They're searching everywhere.
We'll never get out of here.

404
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:21,413
- I want to see Papa and Maman.
- Calm down.

405
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,541
This is not the time to cry.
We'll wait a little longer.

406
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,291
Damn it.

407
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,903
Hey Parisians! Are you OK?

408
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,890
Come with me.

409
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,666
Go.

410
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:46,375
Come on, little one.

411
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:57,750
Come on!

412
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,916
Be careful.

413
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,125
Stand up.

414
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,250
Hey! Psst. This way.

415
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,390
Father Bronchet's been caught.

416
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,583
It had to happen eventually.

417
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,656
He transfers twelve at a time.

418
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,703
They make too much noise.

419
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:32,132
Please.
Please.

420
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:33,708
We're lost.

421
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,960
Come. Come.

422
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,334
Come down!

423
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,234
I'm with my wife and my mother.

424
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,562
Our ferryman has abandoned us.
I beg you to help us.

425
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:49,908
It's 1000 per head.

426
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:53,197
The little one is free, but...
I don't want to hear him. Good?

427
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:55,166
Very good.
Thank you sir.

428
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:56,181
"Sir"?

429
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,375
He's funny...

430
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,104
Come on, it's okay. Pass it over.

431
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:07,541
Go.

432
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,893
Do you see that barn over there?

433
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,487
It's open. The farmer is aware.

434
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,314
Go in. You can sleep on the straw.

435
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,433
Thank you.
Thank you.

436
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,433
Hey, are we in the free zone there?

437
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:36,354
"In the free zone"?
You've been there for 10 minutes.

438
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,675
- Is that all? Was it that easy?
- Are you disappointed?

439
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:45,026
I told you.
With me, no danger, and no Germans.

440
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,862
In the free zone...
Free from what exactly?

441
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:06,974
Are we free to be Jews?

442
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:10,159
We're free to sleep, dummy.

443
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,374
Twenty kilometers on foot,
wear out, wear out...

444
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:18,375
Twenty kilometers on foot,
it wears out your soles.

445
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,200
Twenty one kilometers on foot,
wear out, wear out...

446
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,166
Twenty one kilometers on foot,
it wears out your soles.

447
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:31,291
Twenty two kilometers on foot,
wear out, wear out...

448
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,166
Twenty two kilometers on foot,
it wears out your soles.

449
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:38,125
Twenty three kilometers on foot...

450
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,708
- Are you limping?
- No, it's nothing.

451
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,706
- Your foot hurts.
- It's nothing!

452
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,000
Show me. Sit down.

453
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:55,853
Shit.

454
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,135
You can't walk with that anymore.

455
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,510
It is not worth insisting.

456
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,338
Come on, come on.

457
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,385
Grab your bag.
I'll take you on my back.

458
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,200
Go.

459
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,666
Do you know your feet stink?

460
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,541
Your ass stinks.

461
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,292
But thanks anyway.

462
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,135
That's normal, you're
my little brother.

463
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:45,322
I would carry you to the end
of the world, if necessary.

464
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:51,525
Come on, get off. You're too heavy.

465
00:33:56,877 --> 00:34:00,250
- Until the end of the world, huh?
- Oh, you're getting on my nerves...

466
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,205
- What? Are we lazy?
- No, it's my brother...

467
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:22,572
- My brother is too tired to walk.
- Come on, get in!

468
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,750
Go ahead, get up.

469
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,439
Okay, here we go!

470
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:41,692
- That's Adolf.
- What are you going to do with it?

471
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,603
What did you think?
We'll make him bleed.

472
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,127
We make black pudding from his blood.

473
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:46,768
And then rillettes and bacon.

474
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,307
And of course meat.

475
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:49,785
Turn around, Adolf.

476
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,627
That's her ass.

477
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:54,728
You don't think that she's
going to shoot at us, huh?

478
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,893
Adolf, kaputt!

479
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:17,025
Maurice and I changed our route
to avoid highways.

480
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:20,849
It was too good to be like
that, to travel freely...

481
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,958
like we've never done before.

482
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:26,530
We ended up forgetting that we
were running away from something.

483
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,166
There were no parents, no school,

484
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,499
And above all, no one
to tell us what to do.

485
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:42,533
Watch out, little one.
That's not for girls.

486
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,250
We meet all sorts
of people on our journey.

487
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,385
Some more fun than others...

488
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,885
But everyone was afraid.

489
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,000
You could see it in their eyes.

490
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,603
Even though everyone
was pretending.

491
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,564
Oh, look there!

492
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,208
Wow.

493
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,291
I can not believe my eyes.

494
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:18,111
How blue it is!

495
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,791
Look. We've finally arrived.

496
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,700
Hey boy, you're losing your coat.

497
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,042
Thank you sir.

498
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,481
Hey, I'm taking a picture!

499
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:55,667
Come on, I don't bite.
I eat you alone...

500
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,439
Come on, you take
your time. The beauty...

501
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,635
Those Italians are more
relaxed than the Germans.

502
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,132
Come on, let's find our parents.

503
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:16,416
Turnips or Jerusalem artichokes?

504
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,416
Jo.

505
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,750
The beautiful fish!

506
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,971
Hello. Are you looking for something?

507
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,041
Mister Levine's hair salon, please?

508
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,557
It's right there.

509
00:37:57,722 --> 00:38:00,263
Hello.
Oh, the children! Great.

510
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:01,204
Albert!

511
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:03,900
Albert!

512
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:10,067
Look.

513
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:24,057
It seems that happiness
passes faster than sadness.

514
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,874
We were finally all together.

515
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,124
The rest did not exist.

516
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,533
He still needs his Maman and Papa.

517
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:37,099
Especially his father to dry his hair.

518
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:38,958
You're not cold?

519
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,278
Okay darling ?

520
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,381
Never again do you leave me like that.
Never again. Promised.

521
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,083
Never again.

522
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:50,950
Never again.

523
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,291
I was afraid.

524
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,961
We too were afraid.

525
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,499
When you have children of your own,
you will understand.

526
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,869
I'm so proud of you, son.

527
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,583
So proud.

528
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,893
I will always be there in your heart.

529
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,666
Always.

530
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,833
You are crazy!

531
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,333
Go. Watch out.

532
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,666
Watch out.

533
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,416
No.

534
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,250
No no no.

535
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,542
No no. No !

536
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:48,205
3 MONTHS LATER...

537
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:13,166
Oh shit.

538
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,853
You could help me, instead of laughing.

539
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:19,737
I have better things to do.
What shall we do now?

540
00:40:19,805 --> 00:40:21,263
Let's go to the beach.

541
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:28,244
Is that all?

542
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,666
It fell out.

543
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,289
And the other?

544
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:36,158
Fallen out. If you don't understand,
trading is not for you.

545
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,791
Tomorrow I need tomatoes.

546
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,643
- Impossible.
- But why?

547
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,244
On Mondays, the Italian
soldiers give me some olive oil.

548
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:49,744
I trade that for soap,
that I exchange for sugar,

549
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:52,208
that I exchange for flour,
that I trade for cigarettes.

550
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:57,158
To find tomatoes for a week,
messes up my organization.

551
00:40:58,127 --> 00:40:59,249
I understand nothing.

552
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:01,697
If you don't understand,
trading is not for you.

553
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,307
And five.

554
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:07,814
What are you going
to do with all that money?

555
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,206
I have an idea for that.
Ciao, Marcello!

556
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,557
Too long. Tell Albert to
trim the back of your hair.

557
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,416
Roman, did you know that Jo will
eventually will buy the Excelsior Hotel?

558
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,791
- Were you still at the market this morning?
- Yes.

559
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:29,500
And school ?

560
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,833
It's Thursday, Papa.

561
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,625
- You don't miss school, do you?
- No, I won't.

562
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,322
It's not possible.

563
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,978
Stop speaking Yiddish.
How often do I have to say that?

564
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:45,033
Relax, Roman.
Enjoy the beautiful sun.

565
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:48,705
Look at these two crickets.
The war isn't over yet.

566
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,833
You never know.
You see everything in black.

567
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,783
I see everything in black.

568
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,921
I said nothing.

569
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,455
No, he did not say anything.

570
00:41:58,518 --> 00:41:59,851
I distrust everything.

571
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,236
I hear terrible stories
about the camps.

572
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:02,572
We're in no danger.

573
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:06,096
The Italians are soldiers, not killers.
Tell him, Marcello.

574
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,705
That's true. We don't
kill women and children.

575
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:12,353
No, you certainly don't kill women.
You break their hearts.

576
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,666
What do you want too?
I love the charm of the French.

577
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:18,666
Their seriousness turns
me on. Come on, play!

578
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:21,807
Belote, rebelote and profit!
What do you say to that?

579
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,314
Well done, Papa.

580
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,916
Orders in Italian

581
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,208
What's the matter ?

582
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,958
Mussolini was arrested.

583
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,197
- It's chaos in Rome.
- What's going to happen?

584
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,814
We're going back to Italy tomorrow.

585
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,916
- The holiday is over.
- Yes...

586
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:39,941
Seriously...

587
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,413
Does it mean the war is over?

588
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,583
No. That means the
Germans are coming.

589
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,725
Don't tell Maman.

590
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,721
Do not spoil her surprise.

591
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:56,102
Okay.

592
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,858
- More cake...
- No, take some pie. There is enough.

593
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:04,041
But what is this ?
Is that for me ?

594
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:05,371
Yes.

595
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,869
What is that, then?

596
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:17,456
But you're crazy...
You should not have done that...

597
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:20,330
I didn't do it, it's from the boys.

598
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,088
From you? Jo.

599
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,187
This is not for you,
it's for me.

600
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,455
I miss hearing you play.

601
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,486
But I don't know how to play anymore, darling.

602
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,052
Of course you do.

603
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:37,375
Go.

604
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:44,434
You know... My father
gave me my first violin.

605
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:47,174
I played...

606
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:50,025
And you recited poems.

607
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,111
Poems?

608
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:52,666
Which poems?

609
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:54,244
Poems of love. Hey?

610
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,057
Love Poems!

611
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,156
Here.

612
00:43:57,357 --> 00:43:58,190
That's what we want to hear!

613
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,990
Oh no.
Yes, yes, yes.

614
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:02,489
Yes, yes.

615
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,893
I don't remember them anymore.

616
00:44:03,961 --> 00:44:05,658
And I want to hear your mother play.

617
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,635
Go ahead, darling.

618
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,916
Police ! Open up!

619
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:58,169
Hide yourselves, children!

620
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:00,615
Don't open it.

621
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,814
Mrs. Joffo? We have a
summons for Henri and Albert.

622
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:07,490
I'm not Mrs. Joffo.
We're not at 6, rue Pairolière?

623
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:09,364
I beg you, think.

624
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:10,990
We don't have a choice.

625
00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:13,533
- I'll stay alone. Go now.
- Stop!

626
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,158
I've had enough of this...

627
00:45:15,183 --> 00:45:18,150
Hide yourself.
Think of the children.

628
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:20,587
It's the police!

629
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:24,782
Go ahead, go.

630
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:27,197
Open up! It's the police!

631
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:28,546
We heard you.

632
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,291
I'm coming.

633
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,459
What are you doing ?

634
00:45:45,282 --> 00:45:46,115
Yes?

635
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,789
Henri and Albert Joffo

636
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:52,883
Live here?
Yes.

637
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:55,265
But they're not here.
I am their father. Can I help you?

638
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:59,240
There is a call for the CLS,
the Compulsory Labor Service.

639
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:01,497
They are expected
tomorrow at this address.

640
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:03,287
Very good.

641
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:05,578
I will give it to them. Good night.

642
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,583
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

643
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:08,607
Wait.

644
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,143
Did you play the violin?

645
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:18,867
Not at all.

646
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:20,960
No, not me. I took a nap.

647
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,640
He took a nap.

648
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:25,008
- Are you making fun of us?
- Absolutely not.

649
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,406
Are you alone?

650
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:29,640
I don't know. I was sleeping.

651
00:46:30,672 --> 00:46:32,039
Show me your papers, sir.

652
00:46:33,513 --> 00:46:34,734
Hurry up.

653
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,002
Let's go. Let's go.

654
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,078
Sir.

655
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,203
Was that Jewish music we heard, huh?

656
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,289
- Jewish?
- Yes, Jewish.

657
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,180
Yes or no?

658
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,226
- I don't know.
- Is there a problem, honey?

659
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,662
- Hello, sir.
- Sir wonders...

660
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:12,289
how I'd rather go to sleep
while you play the violin. Me too...

661
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,303
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Do you play?

662
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,302
Yes I do. See!

663
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:18,023
Don't you like music, sir?

664
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:21,400
No, he likes music,
but not Jewish music.

665
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:22,195
Ah... okay.

666
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,055
Oh, I understand. But I'm
Russian and I'm proud of that.

667
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,515
And my maiden name is Markov.

668
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:34,226
I am a descendant of the
Imperial Romanov family.

669
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,742
It is insulting to say that
I play Jewish music, sir.

670
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:43,742
Yes...

671
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:47,226
You pass the CLS papers
to Henri and Albert.

672
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,555
- We'll do that.
- Good. Have A Nice Day.

673
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:54,578
- Thank you.
- Madam...

674
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,500
We gotta get out of here.

675
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,666
One two. One two. One two.

676
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,740
One two. One two.

677
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,515
There's plenty to do.

678
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,206
Here, take your brother's...

679
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:35,773
You are the boss now.

680
00:48:35,856 --> 00:48:37,937
You promised we would stay together.

681
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:40,375
I didn't think you would be liars.

682
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:43,875
Calm down.
There is no other way.

683
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:47,786
If we could, we would stay with
you, but we have no choice.

684
00:48:47,877 --> 00:48:51,922
I don't want us to separate.
I want to go back to Paris.

685
00:48:51,955 --> 00:48:53,795
Stop it, Jo.
For us it's difficult too.

686
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,805
I want to be with you.

687
00:48:56,252 --> 00:48:57,710
I want to be with you.

688
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:02,062
That's enough, Jojo.

689
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:05,789
Pull yourself together. If we all start
crying, it will be useless.

690
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:09,084
We cannot stay together.
It's too dangerous.

691
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:12,789
You have to move forward
now and don't look back.

692
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:17,836
We must go now.
We will meet soon.

693
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:20,857
We will meet soon.

694
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,219
Come on, come on.

695
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:27,240
Come.

696
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,483
Come on.

697
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:09,947
Is this a camp for collaborators, sir?

698
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:12,516
It is a government camp for minors,

699
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:15,041
So he is a Petainist.
Do not worry.

700
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:19,320
Most of the people here
are not really Catholic.

701
00:50:19,693 --> 00:50:21,195
But they pretend.

702
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:23,434
You're Catholic, aren't you?

703
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:25,042
- Of course, sir.
- Yes.

704
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,711
You will find out for
yourself who you can't trust.

705
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:29,443
It's pretty obvious.

706
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:32,307
Gérard, would you like to give a tour?

707
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:36,711
Follow me, toads.

708
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:39,707
Every morning we
get up at six o'clock.

709
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:49,818
Hey! Here's a small gift.

710
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:53,859
- What's that for?
- For your ears.

711
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:55,557
Go upstairs to the dormitory.

712
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,898
We have to be on our guard here.
Never say that you're Jewish.

713
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:14,570
We're not Jewish.

714
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:17,476
That's what I thought.

715
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,992
We're not, either.

716
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:22,550
Didn't you understand?

717
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:25,351
There are no Jews here.
"Schmock."

718
00:51:26,737 --> 00:51:27,820
Do not worry.

719
00:51:27,896 --> 00:51:29,062
We are among us.

720
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:33,265
Watch out for Gerard and his gang there.

721
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,498
He's a real cunt.

722
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:37,203
I already understood that.

723
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:42,953
And him?
Him? He's Ange.

724
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:45,269
A foreigner. From Algeria.

725
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,367
Are you talking about me, or I'm dreaming?
Hi, newbies.

726
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:49,953
You come from Africa?

727
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:53,750
From Africa. He thinks I'm out
the jungle come to the elephants.

728
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:55,242
I am from Algiers.

729
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:56,942
And why are you here?

730
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,711
Actually, you see...

731
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,070
I was at my brother's in Paris,

732
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:04,601
And during this time the
English landed in Algeria.

733
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:07,289
- And thus?
- So I'm stuck in France.

734
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:10,914
And besides, my brother met
a girl. Then he put me here.

735
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:13,976
So you miss your parents.

736
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:16,078
Frankly, not at all.

737
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:19,430
My father is always behind
me and calls me a donkey.

738
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,209
Donkey here, donkey there.

739
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,257
I've had enough of that.

740
00:52:25,524 --> 00:52:26,976
Oh, are you okay, chicken?

741
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,109
Donkey, huh?

742
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:32,023
Follow me.

743
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:34,146
SEPTEMBER 1943
We raise our heads.

744
00:52:34,227 --> 00:52:35,768
One two. One two.

745
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:36,746
One two.

746
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:43,601
I'm telling you, the
Krauts are everywhere.

747
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:47,055
They need their quota of
Jews to take to Germany.

748
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:49,883
There is panic in Nice.
We're better here.

749
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:55,351
- How so? Are you Jewish?
- I? No. How so. You?

750
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:56,703
No.
No.

751
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:57,961
I am.

752
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,440
Just kidding.

753
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,648
Boy, you should have seen your faces!

754
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:08,823
That's me: the best.

755
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:12,406
Attention !

756
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:15,469
What happened ?

757
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:20,609
Is he crazy? He almost hit us!

758
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,023
Shit.

759
00:53:25,055 --> 00:53:27,609
I'm sorry, but with the mud and rain,
it doesn't slow down.

760
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,356
In addition, the steering
wheel is on the right.

761
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,742
But it's okay. You can eat puree.

762
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:33,573
Puree yourself! Here!

763
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:35,073
Come on.

764
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:36,648
Come on.

765
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:39,656
Puree, you yourself.
Just go.

766
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:43,031
Stop. Here, take that!

767
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:44,448
No !

768
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,115
Bring it back!

769
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:50,657
This way. Come on, we're hurrying.

770
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,805
Come on!

771
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,516
What's the matter ?

772
00:53:57,773 --> 00:53:59,573
Have you heard the new one?

773
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:01,656
Catch the Germans, Jews everywhere.

774
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,687
Eventually they will arrive here too.

775
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:05,711
So what?
Aren't we Catholic?

776
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:06,687
Yes...

777
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:09,851
Joseph Joffo, resident of Clignancourt,

778
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:11,713
right in the Jewish quarter...

779
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,992
They just have to watch
you take a piss to confirm.

780
00:54:16,437 --> 00:54:18,594
- The penis?
I'm not a kid anymore.

781
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:20,010
What do you call that?

782
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:22,203
Bah... The "zboub".

783
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,781
"The 'zboub'."

784
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,758
Who told you that ?

785
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:28,922
- Angie.
- The Algerian?

786
00:54:28,947 --> 00:54:29,947
Yes.

787
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,531
We just say we
come from there too.

788
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:35,413
From Algeria?

789
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:39,395
Well yeah. The same
story he told.

790
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:42,508
The journey, the
landing, everything.

791
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,164
Yes, that's a good idea.

792
00:54:46,113 --> 00:54:47,738
They won't be able to check.

793
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:52,797
You're not that stupid are you...

794
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,015
Hey Joffo, move your ass over here!

795
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,101
Okay Algerian, show us what you
have in your belly.

796
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:01,687
Next one!

797
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:04,508
Hey, Joffo!

798
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,422
If we tell that, where do we live?

799
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,867
- Rue Jean-Jaures 10.
- What about Jean-Jaures?

800
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:12,725
Because there's always a
Jean-Jaures street and it's easy to remember.

801
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,424
The rest remains as it is is:
the house, the drawing room...

802
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:17,859
Papa is a hairdresser,
Maman plays the violin.

803
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,859
Then we cannot make any mistakes.

804
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:21,859
Come on. Come on!

805
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,403
You're not too stupid, either.

806
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,489
Come on, you follow.

807
00:55:31,924 --> 00:55:33,007
We accelerate!

808
00:55:37,612 --> 00:55:38,445
Come on!

809
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,772
- Ouch!
- Let's practice it.

810
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:43,336
Where do you go to school, 'little boy'?"

811
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,617
Rue Jean-Jaurès.
In the same street where...

812
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:49,351
- What is your mother's name?
- Anne Marie.

813
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,094
- And your father?
- Roman.

814
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:53,610
That's good.

815
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:55,539
Come on, let's go.

816
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:09,038
I miss them.

817
00:56:10,354 --> 00:56:11,625
Me too.

818
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:14,836
It's not normal,
that we don't hear from them.

819
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,617
Maybe they're
suspicious of the phone.

820
00:56:18,195 --> 00:56:19,461
I want to see them.

821
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,086
- We don't know where they are.
- So what? I want to see them!

822
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:30,198
We're accelerating a bit here.

823
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:37,323
Guys, tell me, do you
have family in Nice?

824
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:40,937
- No, let's go for a walk.
- Walk around?

825
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:44,976
Are you going to the Promenade
des Anglais to see the girls?

826
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:46,422
Yes that's it.

827
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,922
Don't say stupid things,
that he doesn't believe.

828
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,031
You don't have to be
ashamed when you look at girls.

829
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:55,156
In a few years they will be looking
at you too. You're good looking enough.

830
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:56,648
Watch out!

831
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,053
That's sensational, isn't it!

832
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,836
Wow! Go on.

833
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,961
We're gonna look at the girls!

834
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:10,698
WE WILL WATCH THE GIRLS!
WE WILL SEE GIRLS!

835
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:19,383
This is not the market...

836
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:22,101
I need two minutes.
Wait for me. I will return.

837
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,664
Wait here, huh?
I'm counting on you.

838
00:57:28,096 --> 00:57:29,179
Shh.

839
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,469
It's not funny. Open your door.

840
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:38,820
How do you do that?

841
00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:41,039
Don't you know how open a door?

842
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:08,062
- Don't you get tired of doing nothing?
- No...

843
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,609
He's been gone for a while.
What the hell is he doing?

844
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:18,668
He said to wait.

845
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:23,345
Come on, stay.

846
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,461
You're waiting for me.
Above all, you do not move.

847
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:30,961
I'll tell him we're going
to the market on foot.

848
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:39,862
Jo.

849
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:42,222
Are you okay?

850
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,698
- Okay, okay.
- Sit up.

851
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:51,315
You promised not to move.

852
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:54,601
I'm sorry.

853
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:07,761
Children! You say nothing.

854
01:00:16,657 --> 01:00:17,740
Quickly.

855
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,005
Meyer, Martha.

856
01:00:37,956 --> 01:00:38,831
Hurry.

857
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:42,284
There's one more coming.

858
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:44,925
Dreyfuss, Louis.

859
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,445
Goldman, Gabriel.

860
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:57,276
Epstein, Doris.

861
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,198
Goldman, Mordecai.

862
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:07,753
Abel, Adele.

863
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:26,870
Walk! Walk!

864
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:28,370
Abou, Gabriel.

865
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:32,440
Saul, Levin.

866
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,031
It's Levine.

867
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:37,346
It's Levine.

868
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,060
Goldfarb, Michael.

869
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:41,924
And do you see Maman and Papa?

870
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:25,846
Usually, I begin by asking
name, first name and religion.

871
01:02:26,149 --> 01:02:27,690
But here I am lost.

872
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:30,409
Why all these false papers?

873
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:32,890
Are you Jewish?

874
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:36,440
No.

875
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,252
Are you not a Jew?

876
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:45,974
No.

877
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:02,654
So...

878
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:05,479
You are a resistance fighter.

879
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:08,630
No.

880
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,327
We slaughter all resistance fighters.

881
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,158
These are the orders.

882
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:20,132
In German:
He is a resistance fighter.

883
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:28,572
Unless you are Jew...

884
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:32,898
No.

885
01:03:43,795 --> 01:03:47,010
Yes, I am a Jew.
Is that what you want to know?

886
01:03:47,307 --> 01:03:48,348
I am Jewish.

887
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,218
And also a resistance fighter.

888
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,911
Jew and resistance fighter.
Kill me if you want.

889
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:57,760
It will not change anything.
You will not win the war.

890
01:03:58,198 --> 01:03:59,917
You have already lost the war.

891
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:02,909
I am Jew and resistance fighter.

892
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:04,284
And I shit on you!

893
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:05,142
Stop!

894
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:14,129
He is a resistance fighter.

895
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:29,112
Next.

896
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:34,088
Name, first name, religion.

897
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:39,338
David Cohen, I'm a Jew.

898
01:04:55,971 --> 01:04:56,846
Next.

899
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:04,752
Name, first name, religion.

900
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:07,096
Listen, we have nothing to do with all this.

901
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:08,963
We are from 'Moissons Nouvelles'.

902
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:11,245
Name, first name, religion.

903
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,815
Maurice Joffo, Catholic.

904
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:18,549
We just went with Ferdinand to go shopping.
It is a mistake, sir.

905
01:05:18,779 --> 01:05:21,820
- We have nothing to do with it.
- Is that your brother ?

906
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:28,182
Yes, it's my brother Jo.

907
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:36,854
Jo... Like Joseph?

908
01:05:38,294 --> 01:05:39,127
Yes.

909
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,221
Our mother's name is Marie.

910
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:49,838
I see.

911
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:52,502
So you're not a Jew?

912
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:55,729
No, I already told you that.

913
01:05:56,306 --> 01:06:00,264
Stop! We are Algerians!
Catholic Algerians.

914
01:06:02,477 --> 01:06:03,685
We'll start again.

915
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:08,781
Are you Jewish?

916
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,823
No.

917
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:13,846
No!

918
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:16,140
Stop!

919
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:27,611
Let go of me.

920
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:34,224
To the medical examination!

921
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,270
You say you are Catholic?
Yes.

922
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,489
Yes, in Algeria we do
this as a precaution.

923
01:06:57,302 --> 01:06:59,036
Otherwise adhesions will occur.

924
01:06:59,442 --> 01:07:00,231
Yes sir.

925
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:02,098
They circumcise everyone's 'zboub'.

926
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,911
The Algerians, the Catholics: everyone.

927
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:06,727
Even the Jews.

928
01:07:08,341 --> 01:07:11,278
That I do not know.
There are not many Jews there.

929
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,544
I've never seen one.
On my word: that is the truth.

930
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:14,978
Sit down.

931
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:19,544
My name is Rosen.
Know you what that means?

932
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:20,559
No.

933
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:22,488
That you are pink?

934
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:27,341
No, I am a Jew.
So you can tell me, to me,

935
01:07:28,198 --> 01:07:29,778
That you too are Jews.

936
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:36,411
- You are Jew, but we are not.
- We are Algerian.

937
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:39,494
That's why our 'zboub' is circumcised.

938
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,247
So, Jewish or not, you
know what you have to do.

939
01:07:56,024 --> 01:07:57,315
Guard!

940
01:08:01,163 --> 01:08:03,731
It's medical, not religious.

941
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:04,919
Please...

942
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:07,247
Go.

943
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,513
Next.

944
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:17,468
I will always wonder why the doctor...

945
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:19,069
had saved us.

946
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:22,481
While every day he had
to condemn hundreds.

947
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:32,719
On the Rue Jean-Jaures, as
I have already told you.

948
01:08:35,826 --> 01:08:37,451
The name of the school?

949
01:08:37,664 --> 01:08:39,372
The primary school in Algeria.

950
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,540
The Jean-Jaurès school, I think.

951
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:52,133
That's all ?

952
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,782
Well, yes, I think.
I didn't pay attention to it.

953
01:08:54,807 --> 01:08:56,657
It's just the school, isn't it?

954
01:08:56,947 --> 01:08:58,697
Friends at school?

955
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,751
Yes a lot.
Zerati is my best friend.

956
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:04,079
He is very good with marbles.

957
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:05,740
Zerti...

958
01:09:06,594 --> 01:09:09,665
Zerati.
He is good with marbles.

959
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:13,508
- And what games do you play at school?
- Everything.

960
01:09:13,802 --> 01:09:17,126
Playing tag, hide and seek,
thief with redemption...

961
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:18,610
with marbles...

962
01:09:18,635 --> 01:09:22,836
there are many:
marble pit, bowling, target shooting...

963
01:09:22,861 --> 01:09:24,821
the hole, the pyramid...

964
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:26,567
What have I done?

965
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,969
Listen to me, little one...

966
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:33,876
I know when someone
is not telling the truth.

967
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:35,672
And you lie.

968
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,860
And your baptism?

969
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,063
Where was it?

970
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:44,001
At the great church of Algiers, surely?

971
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,032
No. Here in Nice, at the Buffa.

972
01:09:47,924 --> 01:09:50,715
Mama wanted to have the family there.
That's why she preferred it here.

973
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:54,836
Very good.
That should be easy to verify.

974
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,688
A pass for 48 hours!

975
01:09:59,677 --> 01:10:02,969
You have two days to get your
baptismal certificates.

976
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:05,555
If you're not back within 48 hours...

977
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:09,954
I send your little brother
on the next train.

978
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:13,395
Do you understand?

979
01:10:15,151 --> 01:10:17,016
I didn't know what to say.

980
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,451
I don't know of any
churches in Algiers.

981
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:24,454
If it turns out you can't
make it, then don't come back.

982
01:10:25,424 --> 01:10:27,840
One alive is better
than two dead, I think.

983
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,485
Do not say that.
I will return with false papers.

984
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:33,862
It's mission impossible.

985
01:10:35,904 --> 01:10:37,279
Save yourself.

986
01:10:37,385 --> 01:10:39,010
Shut up.
I will be back.

987
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:42,540
- Jo. Something wrong?
- I am tired.

988
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:46,672
It has been going on for a week.
I'm fed up with this bullshit.

989
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,665
- I want it to stop.
- Listen to me.

990
01:10:50,672 --> 01:10:54,344
- As long as there's hope we hold on.
- Hang on, Jo.

991
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:05,110
Maurice Joffo!

992
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:10,735
Listen to me.

993
01:11:11,619 --> 01:11:14,160
I will return. Do you hear me?

994
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:17,240
I'm coming back for you. Promise.

995
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,955
Maman...
No, leave me alone!

996
01:12:16,048 --> 01:12:16,923
Maman.

997
01:12:17,795 --> 01:12:19,378
Leave me alone!
Maman !

998
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,767
Papa...

999
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:34,078
Jo.

1000
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:38,251
Jo.
Papa ?

1001
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:40,672
No, not really, Joseph.

1002
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:44,055
Papa, I didn't say anything.

1003
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,297
Do not say anything. You have
been delirious, but you are saved.

1004
01:12:47,747 --> 01:12:49,705
Sulfonamides have been effective.

1005
01:12:51,274 --> 01:12:52,524
Dr. Rozen?

1006
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:53,950
You are lucky.

1007
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:55,852
Meningitis is often fatal.

1008
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:58,001
And my brother? Maurice?

1009
01:12:58,518 --> 01:13:01,524
- How many days have I been here?
- Two, three days.

1010
01:13:01,895 --> 01:13:04,103
You are cured,
that is the most important.

1011
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,681
Yes. That's how it is.

1012
01:13:07,344 --> 01:13:09,599
That way I can board
the train in good health.

1013
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:14,844
Listen to me carefully.

1014
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:17,126
I'm the one who's going.

1015
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:21,180
I'm going to get on the
train with everyone else later.

1016
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,219
It's better that way.

1017
01:13:26,063 --> 01:13:27,229
You know, Joseph,

1018
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:31,024
Sometimes we do things in life,
which we are not always proud of.

1019
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:33,063
Here.

1020
01:13:34,454 --> 01:13:37,641
You held her tight in your fist, like that...
So...

1021
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:40,951
Throughout your delirium.
You were attached to it.

1022
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,088
That's all I have left from before.

1023
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:46,944
If you keep fighting...

1024
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:50,287
then keep your life in
your fist like this one.

1025
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:52,615
Then you'll be fine.

1026
01:13:53,349 --> 01:13:54,974
What's the use of living?

1027
01:13:55,135 --> 01:13:57,218
It's a matter of chance.

1028
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:58,957
It's stupid.

1029
01:13:58,982 --> 01:13:59,778
Stupid.

1030
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:00,635
Stu...

1031
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:04,186
Joseph...

1032
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,650
Death did not want you twice.

1033
01:14:08,805 --> 01:14:11,451
That means you have a
good reason to live.

1034
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:16,623
Do something with your
life, Joseph. Be proud of it.

1035
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:19,873
Come on, you owe me that.

1036
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:32,998
Goodbye, Joseph.

1037
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,561
These are fakes.

1038
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:40,459
Not at all, I assure you.

1039
01:14:41,287 --> 01:14:44,553
The Archbishop can testify that
these are authentic certificates.

1040
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:47,483
I do not believe you.

1041
01:14:47,508 --> 01:14:48,424
Why ?

1042
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,756
I recognize the truth when I see her.

1043
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:57,366
And when I look at you...
Do you know what I see then?

1044
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:02,897
The certificates of the priest
from Buffa, I gave to the Krauts.

1045
01:15:03,024 --> 01:15:04,928
I alerted Subinagui too.

1046
01:15:06,073 --> 01:15:07,781
He's coming for us.

1047
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:12,225
And... Papa and Maman?

1048
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:22,034
The salon is closed.

1049
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,738
It does not matter.

1050
01:15:27,953 --> 01:15:30,639
We'll get out of here and
we'll find them one day.

1051
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,201
Why do you bother about them?

1052
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:35,721
They are Jewish.

1053
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:39,116
- I put my hand in the fire.
- It's obsession.

1054
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:42,129
But that doesn't change anything.
They lie.

1055
01:15:42,648 --> 01:15:45,551
And you too.
The Archbishop

1056
01:15:46,386 --> 01:15:50,198
The Archbishop does not want two
children judged on mere assumptions.

1057
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,667
He will inform Rome.

1058
01:15:53,268 --> 01:15:55,965
You don't want it do you?
Have a pontificate against you?

1059
01:15:57,785 --> 01:15:59,225
Certainly not now.

1060
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:00,824
We shall see.

1061
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:03,162
Understood!

1062
01:16:04,756 --> 01:16:09,006
Hey brothers! Go get
me tomatoes from the garden.

1063
01:16:12,474 --> 01:16:15,099
I don't understand
why they won't let us go.

1064
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:20,908
Come.

1065
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,820
You see that vegetable garden?

1066
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:30,605
It's very easy to escape from there.

1067
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:34,746
There's more to that.

1068
01:16:36,698 --> 01:16:37,698
Here, there?

1069
01:16:38,032 --> 01:16:39,323
Really, very easy.

1070
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:05,012
Maurice... look.

1071
01:17:10,607 --> 01:17:13,230
You vouch for their
innocence, don't you?

1072
01:17:16,782 --> 01:17:18,699
Did you see ?
Yes.

1073
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:20,229
Let's go ?

1074
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:23,906
We're going, on three.

1075
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:25,721
One...

1076
01:17:27,716 --> 01:17:28,549
Two...

1077
01:17:31,422 --> 01:17:32,713
Three, go.

1078
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:34,886
Watch out!

1079
01:17:35,823 --> 01:17:37,051
There's a soldier.

1080
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:39,283
It's a trap.

1081
01:18:01,736 --> 01:18:04,319
Thank you, Father.
You saved our lives.

1082
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:07,727
Mr. Subinagui!

1083
01:18:09,508 --> 01:18:11,105
Hello, children.

1084
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,676
Thank you, Father.
You were brave.

1085
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:15,913
I only did my duty.

1086
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,754
Go in peace, my children.

1087
01:18:17,825 --> 01:18:19,863
Come on. We must not hang around here.

1088
01:18:23,309 --> 01:18:24,142
Jo.

1089
01:18:26,182 --> 01:18:27,348
Farewell, Father.

1090
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,865
Go. Go.

1091
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,023
What are you moaning about...

1092
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:56,341
Papa !

1093
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:03,146
Where is Maman ?
Your mother is with her sister,

1094
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,771
And your brothers, in Savoy.

1095
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:06,629
I stayed to find you.

1096
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:11,905
What is that ?

1097
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:22,786
Better a slap that hurts,
rather than never see you again.

1098
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,679
Papa promised us we
would meet in Paris

1099
01:20:21,861 --> 01:20:23,536
Once the war was over.

1100
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:27,560
But, for now, it was too
dangerous to stay together.

1101
01:21:12,628 --> 01:21:13,503
Maurice?

1102
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,494
Jo. Jo, wake up.

1103
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:19,931
Your Maman's on the phone.

1104
01:21:28,872 --> 01:21:30,580
Hi Maman ?
It's me.

1105
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,432
"My darling, are you okay?"

1106
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:34,896
You have to leave right away.

1107
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,846
Your father has the
same illness you did.

1108
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,396
Meningitis ?

1109
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:42,790
Worse than that.

1110
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:50,873
Hello?

1111
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:54,685
I understood that she was
talking about Papa's arrest,

1112
01:21:55,665 --> 01:21:57,498
But I no longer had tears.

1113
01:21:58,138 --> 01:22:00,138
They were replaced with anger.

1114
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,763
Again, we had to flee.

1115
01:22:14,248 --> 01:22:17,039
I can carry you, if you want.
Rather die.

1116
01:22:17,207 --> 01:22:20,040
I'm the big brother.
I'm the one who carries.

1117
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,208
We were in touch
with the others lost.

1118
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,143
But that wasn't a big deal.

1119
01:22:50,391 --> 01:22:52,849
Because if Maurice and I
had already arrived there,

1120
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:55,080
then Papa sure would be.

1121
01:22:55,373 --> 01:22:58,248
Everything was going to be fine.
You had to believe in that.

1122
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:15,693
While waiting for the end of the war,
Maurice and I had a job.

1123
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:18,146
Just like Maman told us to do.

1124
01:23:18,696 --> 01:23:19,987
Any job.

1125
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:29,552
Maurice worked in the
largest restaurant nearby...

1126
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:34,005
and I was a delivery person for
the bookseller, Ambroise Mancelier.

1127
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:39,181
You see, Joseph,

1128
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:42,560
you won't learn anything
at a public school,

1129
01:23:43,087 --> 01:23:46,365
because public school
has become like a girl...

1130
01:23:47,207 --> 01:23:50,200
What characterizes the great minds,
is to have an ideal.

1131
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:52,185
And there aren't 36 things to do.

1132
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:54,789
No, there is only one thing to do for Europe.

1133
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:58,435
And they are three great minds,
my dear Joseph, that Europe has made:

1134
01:23:58,795 --> 01:23:59,961
Louis XIV,

1135
01:24:00,021 --> 01:24:02,794
Napoleon Bonaparte
and Philippe Pétain.

1136
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,794
"I keep my promises,
even those of others."

1137
01:24:06,638 --> 01:24:08,185
Oh, that's beautiful...

1138
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:10,747
Congratulations, my little Joseph.

1139
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,997
My son.

1140
01:24:15,332 --> 01:24:17,036
Here. Bravo.

1141
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:18,165
Look.

1142
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:20,833
You do good work every now
and then, in the Militia.

1143
01:24:21,388 --> 01:24:24,177
MILITIA EXPORTS 20,000 JEWS
It's just the beginning.

1144
01:24:24,582 --> 01:24:26,263
France for the French, Papa.

1145
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:33,755
Wait a second boy...

1146
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:37,293
You sleep under my roof and have been
working with me, for almost six months.

1147
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:39,464
So you're part of the family, right?

1148
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:41,082
Yes sir.

1149
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:43,099
Your parents must miss you,

1150
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:44,874
being so far away from you, in Algeria.

1151
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,685
Yes, a lot.

1152
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,888
As of today, you will eat with us...

1153
01:24:51,839 --> 01:24:56,419
but from Sunday you will also share
in something that is very dear to us...

1154
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:58,081
the Holy Mass.

1155
01:25:03,457 --> 01:25:06,411
I understand that you are not
very devoted to the mass.

1156
01:25:06,747 --> 01:25:09,552
It is time you did as our Christian faith teaches.

1157
01:25:10,082 --> 01:25:10,915
Yes.

1158
01:25:10,982 --> 01:25:12,630
Thank you, Mr. Mancelier.

1159
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:19,786
Newspaper!

1160
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:22,606
'La Gerbe', 'La Proche',
'Je Suis Partout'!

1161
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:27,757
'La Gerbe', 'Le Petit Dauphinois',
'Je Suis Partout', the newspaper!

1162
01:25:27,797 --> 01:25:29,435
Who wants the newspaper?

1163
01:25:29,477 --> 01:25:30,834
Let's see, little one.

1164
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,122
Oh no, thank you.

1165
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:37,440
'La Gerbe', 'Le Dauphinois'!

1166
01:25:37,649 --> 01:25:38,649
'Je Suis Partout'!

1167
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:40,185
La Gerbe. The newspaper ?

1168
01:25:40,315 --> 01:25:42,981
The Dauphinois!  La Gerbe!
I'm everywhere!

1169
01:25:43,122 --> 01:25:44,607
Good morning, Ms. Loca.

1170
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:46,940
Oh! Sorry.
My brakes are not working.

1171
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:48,021
I take the  Gerbe.

1172
01:25:48,046 --> 01:25:49,247
La Gerbe ?
Yes.

1173
01:25:49,365 --> 01:25:51,524
Thank you. Have a good day.

1174
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:54,083
The Vichy newspaper, Mr. Julien?

1175
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:56,524
La Gerbe ?  I'm everywhere ?

1176
01:25:57,763 --> 01:25:59,221
Over my dead body.

1177
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:04,740
Here, keep your newspaper. Is he
still always so stupid, that Mancelier?

1178
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:05,765
Always.

1179
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,801
Hello. Here, the newspapers.

1180
01:26:21,326 --> 01:26:22,159
Hey, Jo!

1181
01:26:24,065 --> 01:26:24,981
Shh.

1182
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:28,927
The penguin flaps its wings.

1183
01:26:29,823 --> 01:26:30,656
The Penguin

1184
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:33,226
- What is this?
- The penguin flaps its wings.

1185
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:35,615
Encoded messages for the Resistance.

1186
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,176
The ghost doesn't talk.

1187
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:41,244
Good. I'm going because
Mancelier will call me.

1188
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,833
By the way, how is she,
the girl of the collaborators?

1189
01:26:48,549 --> 01:26:50,318
Why do you want to know that ?

1190
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,122
Still in love with
your little Francoise?

1191
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:54,724
What does that mean?

1192
01:26:54,874 --> 01:26:56,540
5 months that you look at her?

1193
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:59,154
Has she talked with you or not?

1194
01:26:59,973 --> 01:27:01,806
I'm making progress...

1195
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:13,482
And you, your entrance into the Resistance,
are you making any progress?

1196
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:15,721
Don't start on that.

1197
01:27:15,746 --> 01:27:17,829
Do they send you coded messages?

1198
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,053
Yes

1199
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,206
"Françoise has hair on her legs.
I repeat: Françoise has..."

1200
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:26,716
You're really miserable!

1201
01:27:26,816 --> 01:27:27,816
The Militia!

1202
01:27:31,786 --> 01:27:33,831
Maurice, hide everything.

1203
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:35,646
You send the message.

1204
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:42,167
Hold on.

1205
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,831
Lets' go.

1206
01:27:43,857 --> 01:27:44,957
Its good.

1207
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:48,075
Jo, give that to sir Jean
in the factory. Come on!

1208
01:27:48,249 --> 01:27:50,021
Nobody moves.
You stay here.

1209
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,125
Maureler, hurry.
- We are here.

1210
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:52,149
I'll take the floor.

1211
01:27:52,249 --> 01:27:53,404
Search it all.

1212
01:27:53,429 --> 01:27:54,387
Show me.

1213
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,685
What have you got in here?
What are you hiding?

1214
01:28:02,693 --> 01:28:04,896
Remove your hand.
What's this ?

1215
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,613
Empty your pockets.

1216
01:28:09,953 --> 01:28:11,244
- Me ?
- Yes, yes, you.

1217
01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:14,443
I have the impression that you are
a rat and are hiding something.

1218
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:21,865
Go away. Here's your marble.

1219
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:24,268
Don't come here anymore.
Understood?

1220
01:28:31,665 --> 01:28:32,927
So what?

1221
01:28:33,036 --> 01:28:34,802
What are you doing here?

1222
01:28:35,019 --> 01:28:37,352
With what right do you
come inside people's homes?

1223
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:58,763
Who is he?

1224
01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:02,499
The newspaper delivery boy.
He wants to talk to Mr. Jean.

1225
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:06,020
What do you want to say to him?

1226
01:29:06,214 --> 01:29:09,630
Paul, at the Hotel du Commerce,
gave me something for him.

1227
01:29:10,348 --> 01:29:12,051
What does Paul look like?

1228
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:16,161
Pretty big, round glasses,
hair brushed to the side.

1229
01:29:20,014 --> 01:29:21,305
Give me the message.

1230
01:29:21,415 --> 01:29:22,965
I have to give it to Mr. Jean.

1231
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,031
I am Mr. Jean.
Go.

1232
01:29:26,387 --> 01:29:27,590
Come on, hand it over.

1233
01:29:27,915 --> 01:29:29,331
It's him, give it to him.

1234
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:32,348
Take over.

1235
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:33,411
Follow me.

1236
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,918
Close the door.

1237
01:29:40,992 --> 01:29:42,715
There is water in the gas.

1238
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,770
"The Chamois of the Alps jumps."

1239
01:29:45,352 --> 01:29:49,614
We've been waiting for that for a while.
Congratulations, little one. Well done.

1240
01:29:50,053 --> 01:29:52,457
Maryse will tell you if
we ever need you again.

1241
01:29:53,457 --> 01:29:54,290
Come on.

1242
01:29:58,536 --> 01:30:00,665
Attention, Francoise, it's hot.

1243
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,731
Yes!

1244
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,340
Yes !

1245
01:30:05,286 --> 01:30:07,415
Hello. I'm sorry for the delay.

1246
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,332
You lost yourself in the attic?

1247
01:30:12,624 --> 01:30:15,457
- Shut the door, please.
- Yes, excuse me.

1248
01:30:18,832 --> 01:30:19,998
What are you doing here?

1249
01:30:20,036 --> 01:30:21,957
Well, Mr. Mancelier...

1250
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:24,286
- You get out.
- Leave him alone.

1251
01:30:24,874 --> 01:30:27,301
It was Papa who invited him.

1252
01:30:30,165 --> 01:30:31,831
And here is the beast!

1253
01:30:32,082 --> 01:30:33,895
- There you go.
- Joseph, at the table.

1254
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:36,973
Sit yourself next to Raoul, over there.

1255
01:30:37,276 --> 01:30:40,301
I raise my glass... to all mothers

1256
01:30:40,707 --> 01:30:44,286
And to all the women who
will bare children in their bellies,

1257
01:30:44,411 --> 01:30:45,723
for the France of tomorrow.

1258
01:30:45,802 --> 01:30:47,317
Happy birthday, ladies.

1259
01:30:47,789 --> 01:30:49,348
Thank you.
Thank you.

1260
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:54,411
"You are the inspiration of
our Christian civilization."

1261
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,239
- Who said that?
- Marshal Petain, papa.

1262
01:30:57,569 --> 01:30:58,707
Exactly.

1263
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:00,684
How can we treat "sold" men

1264
01:31:00,797 --> 01:31:02,903
who glorified Mother's Day?

1265
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:05,915
My God, help the Marshal to resist.

1266
01:31:06,046 --> 01:31:07,450
And Adolf Hitler.

1267
01:31:07,586 --> 01:31:11,575
If one had allied himself to him in 1936,
with Franco and Mussolini,

1268
01:31:12,403 --> 01:31:14,457
England would not have fired

1269
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:16,520
and Europe was ours.
Anyway.

1270
01:31:16,684 --> 01:31:18,153
And we did not?

1271
01:31:18,178 --> 01:31:20,739
Because our government had become rotten

1272
01:31:20,764 --> 01:31:22,551
by Jewish vermin.

1273
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:25,557
Hitler did a good job.

1274
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:28,684
There's no other way.
Be up to the challenge.

1275
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:31,731
In any case, we're going to
exterminate them, these rats.

1276
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:35,543
They may hide in their holes,
they will all go through it.

1277
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:39,278
 In the meantime, help us to drink.

1278
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:44,536
My brother, he's a jerk.
He is anti-everything.

1279
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,265
Anti-republican, anti-communist,
anti-capitalist...

1280
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,456
Antisemitic.

1281
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:52,114
That too, yes, more than anything else.

1282
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:55,401
He thinks like your father.
Well yeah.

1283
01:31:55,606 --> 01:31:57,661
They're the same, those two.

1284
01:31:57,817 --> 01:32:00,082
I, too, think like my father.

1285
01:32:00,211 --> 01:32:03,002
Who is your father?
You never talk about him.

1286
01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:05,082
Well, that's my father.

1287
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,512
You are mysterious,
you and your brothers.

1288
01:32:12,889 --> 01:32:15,989
True, we do wonder what you hide.

1289
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:17,784
That, "we"

1290
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,773
Me and my girlfriends.

1291
01:32:34,155 --> 01:32:35,559
Francoise. Listen.

1292
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,722
I have to tell you something.

1293
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:41,403
I don't have the right to say it,
but I can tell it to you.

1294
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:43,833
Because I trust you.

1295
01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:46,614
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.

1296
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:51,676
Well, go ahead. I'm listening to you.

1297
01:32:52,374 --> 01:32:53,309
I am...

1298
01:32:54,499 --> 01:32:55,551
I am...

1299
01:33:00,363 --> 01:33:03,154
Do not worry, I get it.

1300
01:33:05,578 --> 01:33:06,536
Come on.

1301
01:33:08,985 --> 01:33:10,818
Come quickly. Quick.

1302
01:33:16,545 --> 01:33:18,700
Hurry up.
Go up the stairs.

1303
01:33:25,637 --> 01:33:26,551
Hey, you.

1304
01:33:27,832 --> 01:33:28,707
The.

1305
01:33:29,455 --> 01:33:31,137
It's my brother.

1306
01:33:37,477 --> 01:33:38,582
Aim.

1307
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:41,614
Fire!

1308
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:49,653
Freedom,

1309
01:33:49,715 --> 01:33:51,879
Equality, Fra...

1310
01:33:56,874 --> 01:33:58,114
Take them away.

1311
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:16,934
Fortunately they did not take you,
the Resistance.

1312
01:34:18,915 --> 01:34:21,067
You might be dead now.

1313
01:34:21,332 --> 01:34:25,051
Imagine having to tell our parents?
And Henry and Albert?

1314
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:32,498
It's the English.
No, it's the Americans.

1315
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:36,956
You know what that means?
We'll see them soon.

1316
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:50,915
Death to the Militia!

1317
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:54,020
You will pay for all
those who have died.

1318
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:55,965
Death to the collaborators!

1319
01:35:11,709 --> 01:35:13,793
Band of bastards!

1320
01:35:14,077 --> 01:35:17,368
You want to give France
back to England? Cretin!

1321
01:35:19,837 --> 01:35:23,378
The English are the historic enemy.
Not the Germans.

1322
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,152
Species of imbeciles!

1323
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:34,606
What are we going to do ?

1324
01:35:34,644 --> 01:35:37,137
It's Waterloo, we lost.

1325
01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:39,498
Be careful Françoise,
that glass will cut you.

1326
01:35:40,285 --> 01:35:42,973
The little one, Ambroise,
must be protected.

1327
01:35:43,749 --> 01:35:45,317
You must take Françoise
to my sister's house.

1328
01:35:45,342 --> 01:35:48,629
Your daughter, your mother, your sister!
I do not care !

1329
01:36:06,702 --> 01:36:08,957
I know what it's like
to leave, you know.

1330
01:36:11,378 --> 01:36:13,965
Everyone in my family had
to leave at one time.

1331
01:36:16,488 --> 01:36:20,207
My father said, "Do not look
behind you when you walk.

1332
01:36:21,797 --> 01:36:24,047
"Otherwise we break our mouths."

1333
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,161
I'm sure you're like your father.

1334
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:50,998
It's not true !

1335
01:36:55,933 --> 01:36:58,599
Joseph! Joseph!

1336
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:00,645
What's happening now?

1337
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:06,194
Misery...

1338
01:37:07,459 --> 01:37:09,075
Paris is liberated!

1339
01:37:09,374 --> 01:37:10,856
Paris is liberated!

1340
01:37:10,915 --> 01:37:13,123
Attention. Paris is liberated!

1341
01:37:13,465 --> 01:37:14,262
Attention.

1342
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:15,748
Paris is liberated!

1343
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:17,040
Attention

1344
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:18,832
Paris is liberated!

1345
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,026
Read the newspaper! Paris is liberated!

1346
01:37:22,749 --> 01:37:25,067
The newspaper! Paris is liberated!

1347
01:37:27,832 --> 01:37:30,246
Paris is liberated! They left!

1348
01:37:30,271 --> 01:37:33,271
They're gone, Jojo.
They left.

1349
01:37:33,563 --> 01:37:35,729
They're gone, it's over.

1350
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:55,114
Look, they're going to Paris.
Go get your brother.

1351
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,387
My dear fellow-citizens,

1352
01:38:01,412 --> 01:38:03,543
today is a big day.

1353
01:38:04,487 --> 01:38:07,320
We are finally free!

1354
01:38:45,514 --> 01:38:48,222
Sleeping with the Germans!
Treacherous!

1355
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:51,873
Jo!

1356
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:53,676
Maurice!

1357
01:38:55,648 --> 01:38:56,895
Do you believe it?

1358
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,044
No. It's finally over.

1359
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:01,388
Come. Cars are going back to Paris.

1360
01:39:02,653 --> 01:39:04,661
- What?
- There's room for us.

1361
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:07,332
Go get your things.
We're going back.

1362
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:18,496
No, I cannot.

1363
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:23,571
Go yourself.
I'll meet you later.

1364
01:39:24,153 --> 01:39:25,317
You're sure?

1365
01:39:25,642 --> 01:39:26,989
What would you do?

1366
01:39:28,152 --> 01:39:29,793
We're free, are we not?

1367
01:39:31,434 --> 01:39:32,600
We're free, yes.

1368
01:39:33,737 --> 01:39:36,668
Tell our parents I'm
coming and I love them.

1369
01:39:41,776 --> 01:39:43,839
Are you going to cope, all by yourself?

1370
01:39:44,098 --> 01:39:45,098
And you?

1371
01:39:45,559 --> 01:39:47,392
You're gonna get away without me?

1372
01:39:48,637 --> 01:39:50,739
Come on, go find her.

1373
01:40:00,988 --> 01:40:02,196
Francoise!

1374
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:07,184
Francoise!

1375
01:40:09,805 --> 01:40:12,364
No. Stop! Stop!

1376
01:40:13,068 --> 01:40:15,192
Stop! Stop!

1377
01:40:19,821 --> 01:40:23,145
Stop! He hid a Jew!

1378
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:24,738
What are you saying ?

1379
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,028
Is that true Jo ?

1380
01:40:26,364 --> 01:40:27,364
It's true.

1381
01:40:28,135 --> 01:40:31,301
That bastard would never hide a Jew.

1382
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:32,942
I swear to you.

1383
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:34,668
And who then?

1384
01:40:35,703 --> 01:40:36,619
Me.

1385
01:40:40,253 --> 01:40:41,503
I am Jewish.

1386
01:40:44,809 --> 01:40:45,934
I am Jewish!

1387
01:40:46,348 --> 01:40:49,387
I am Jewish! I am Jewish!

1388
01:40:49,933 --> 01:40:51,621
I am Jewish!

1389
01:40:54,021 --> 01:40:55,098
Did he know?"

1390
01:40:55,531 --> 01:40:57,161
Of course he knew.

1391
01:40:58,446 --> 01:41:01,004
Nevertheless, he is a collaborator.

1392
01:41:08,082 --> 01:41:10,404
He did it so he would
not be suspected.

1393
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:11,755
We're embarking.

1394
01:41:12,328 --> 01:41:14,778
Go to the hole,
and wait for the judge.

1395
01:41:20,688 --> 01:41:23,864
And Marcelle, we'll
shave her head anyway.

1396
01:41:29,404 --> 01:41:30,404
Thank you.

1397
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:35,187
Where is she, Francoise?

1398
01:42:00,738 --> 01:42:02,325
Francoise, wait!

1399
01:42:03,113 --> 01:42:04,293
Francoise!

1400
01:42:05,029 --> 01:42:06,231
Francoise!

1401
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:10,279
Francoise, wait!

1402
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:55,996
Papa?

1403
01:43:57,571 --> 01:43:58,786
Papa!

1404
01:44:02,602 --> 01:44:03,685
Papa!

1405
01:44:24,154 --> 01:44:25,434
Maman!

1406
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:27,504
Maman, Jojo is back!

1407
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:28,852
Maman, it's me!

1408
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:30,450
Jojo!

1409
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:33,028
Maurice, your brother is here!

1410
01:46:12,028 --> 01:46:12,986
Papa.

1411
01:46:30,113 --> 01:46:32,613
Papa, do you remember?

1412
01:46:33,957 --> 01:46:36,778
You told me that when
a good man dies,

1413
01:46:37,193 --> 01:46:41,309
a star in the sky lights up,
and one had to keep hope.

1414
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:43,637
Well, that's true.

1415
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:47,529
You're here, papa, and
you'll always be.

1416
01:46:50,668 --> 01:46:55,676
In April 1944, Anna, Albert and Henri were arrested
in their flight, then interned in the Drancy camp.

1417
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:59,043
Due to a lack of trains,
they narrowly escaped deportation.

1418
01:46:59,106 --> 01:47:02,137
The Red Cross released them shortly before
the Americans arrived in August 1944.

1419
01:47:02,178 --> 01:47:05,066
The family was thus able to return to Paris.

1420
01:47:06,557 --> 01:47:11,080
Roman, brought by convoy no. 62 to Auschwitz
in November 1943, never returned.

1421
01:47:21,293 --> 01:47:28,188
In 1945, Joseph and Maurice took over their father's hairdressing salon
with their brothers, thus perpetuating the family tradition.

1422
01:47:28,226 --> 01:47:33,196
They still live in Paris, surrounded by their children and grandchildren.
