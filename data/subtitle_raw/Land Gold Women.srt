1
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,967
Rumi and Neruda.

2
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,175
You have excellent taste.

3
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,767
Someone might see us.

4
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,242
Yes. Someone might.

5
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,244
Shall I tell my parents about us?

6
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,407
I have offered
to do it so many times.

7
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,644
I have to tell them soon.

8
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,583
All this secrecy is
driving me insane.

9
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,848
What if they say no?

10
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,481
Hey! Why would hey say no?

11
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,684
Because you're not...

12
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,818
Brown.

13
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,395
Employed, Qualified, Rich.

14
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,561
I am 21. How many 21 year
old millionaires do you know?

15
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,827
Four. And they're all Indian.

16
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,569
I am fighting a losing battle.

17
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,941
Will you transfer out to Cambridge?

18
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,968
My family needs me here.

19
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,472
Mine does too.

20
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,410
Why can't you just come here?

21
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,379
Because I'll be scared all the time.

22
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,677
Look, I've almost finished my book.

23
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,980
When it's done,
I'll go and speak to them.

24
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,378
It's a lot of pressure isn't it?

25
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,219
Pressure? No.

26
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,422
I just have about 300 pages
to write, in about 6 weeks.

27
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,592
A piece of cake really.

28
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,403
Your Queen's council,
Mr. Timothy James

29
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,439
will speak on behalf of you in court.

30
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,599
Good to meet you!

31
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,507
Miss Farah Siddiqui is
your junior solicitor.

32
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,773
She'll be responsible
for assisting Mr. James

33
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,907
in the preparation of
submissions and representations.

34
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,191
How long will this take?

35
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,954
Between 6
- <i>8</i> weeks.

36
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,420
We'll be in conference with
you prior to your court hearing.

37
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,463
How much do you think I'll get?

38
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,664
It depends on why
you did what you did.

39
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,300
She left me no option.

40
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:10,778
Mr. Khan, I would advise you
to choose your words carefully.

41
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,544
What you say could determine
how long you'll be in prison for.

42
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,317
What do you want me to say?

43
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,415
Only things that will help your case.

44
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,451
Things that might help
us understand you better.

45
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,788
I'm not a bad man.

46
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,202
We might have to be a bit
more specific than that.

47
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:40,240
You've been charged with causing
grievous bodily harm to Mr. David Reed

48
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,906
and with conspiracy to
murder of Miss. Saira Ali Khan

49
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,281
and it appears that you have
made admitted to these offences

50
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,683
in interviews with the police.

51
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,511
Could you state for me,

52
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,920
you relationship to the
afore mentioned persons?

53
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,261
Saira was my daughter.

54
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,628
I don't really care
about anyone else.

55
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,770
You're done early today.

56
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,810
I forgot my damn test results.

57
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,436
Bloody busy Thursdays.

58
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,606
I remember it being Monday yesterday.

59
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,543
Where is the time going?

60
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,877
What's keeping you back?

61
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,177
The ruins of Babylon again?

62
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,946
No. I wish.

63
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,149
I'm researching my ruin.

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,884
Saira wants to go to Cambridge.

65
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,353
Wants to get away from you I suppose.

66
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,898
I suppose what goes around,
comes around.

67
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,963
Now I know how my father felt.

68
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,163
We're getting old George.

69
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,470
These kids remind me everyday.

70
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,707
No we're not. We're getting wiser.

71
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,277
It's going to be hard
without her in the house.

72
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,744
You'll get used to it.

73
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,945
Besides, it gives you
more time with the wife.

74
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,320
That's why it's going to be hard.

75
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,493
How do you think it died?

76
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,335
From a sling-shot?

77
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,630
It's been dead for a while.

78
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,967
The blood must have dried up.

79
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,209
What's up doc?

80
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,470
It's been shot.

81
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,885
Who the hell would do that in a park?

82
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,222
What are you doing?

83
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,857
Nothing that concerns you!

84
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,450
They shot the bird!

85
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,888
Don't be stupid, of course not!

86
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,725
Hey! Who are you calling stupid?

87
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,907
Do I look stupid now?

88
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,953
What's the matter? Missing home?

89
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,918
How far we've come Riz...

90
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,558
These pictures seem
like another lifetime.

91
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,892
I'm beginning to forget
what our country looks like.

92
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,735
Oh come on, we were there last year.

93
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,573
Not last year. Two years ago.

94
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,271
It's been two years already?

95
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,872
Yes. And our visits
are always so rushed!

96
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,253
Go in a rush, stay for two weeks,
come back in a hurry.

97
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,291
I don't know what's
wrong with me, Riz...

98
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,956
I feel this strange tug,
a pull inside.

99
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,667
I've missed home before
but this is different.

100
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,608
Maybe your conscience is
trying to tell you something?

101
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,277
Conscience?

102
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,009
Your conscience.

103
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,619
Your heart.

104
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,258
We all have one.

105
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,820
Or maybe you're starting to get old.

106
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,263
Oh! Is that so?

107
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,993
Let me go!

108
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,827
The children will be here any minute!

109
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:00,995
So?

110
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,467
So?

111
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,742
Let me go.

112
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,673
Feeling young, it seems like.

113
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,307
I have work to do.

114
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
Let me go, Nazir.

115
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,564
I come from a
family of carpet makers.

116
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,598
Moved here about 25 years ago

117
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,405
and have always been in Birmingham.

118
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,012
And you've been
teaching for 17 years.

119
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,880
My tenure finished this year.

120
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,347
Did you like your job?

121
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,619
Very much. Yes.

122
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,361
You have no previous convictions,

123
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,227
no court appearances,
never been arrested.

124
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,961
Even your library books have
been returned well on time.

125
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,969
Quite the model citizen Mr. Khan.

126
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,830
Can you then please try

127
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,604
and explain to me how
a professor of History,

128
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,314
a seemingly peaceful academic man

129
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,345
could be party to such a crime?

130
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,291
Do you believe you
did the right thing?

131
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,401
Yes.

132
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,704
I do.

133
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,886
Hello beta,

134
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,895
- Sorry Baba! Did I
wake you? - how are you?

135
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,025
You're home early today?

136
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,393
How come?

137
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,233
This is unfair. If I
come early, I get asked why.

138
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,537
If I come late, I get asked why?

139
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,507
When will a man be free to do
as he wants in his own house?

140
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,507
Come here Saira.

141
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,548
Yes, papa.

142
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,651
Why don't you like our music?

143
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,824
It's not like I don't like it.

144
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,984
I just prefer English music.

145
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,456
If only you knew
what the words meant.

146
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,461
I understand what they mean.

147
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,933
They're mostly about love.

148
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,401
They're beautiful.

149
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,943
Baba! Please.

150
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,374
Stop it!

151
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,309
Stop it!

152
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,320
I'm enjoying my time
home with my daughter.

153
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,614
What's wrong with that?

154
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,021
Did you get my reminder?

155
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,685
Yes I did.

156
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,952
And?

157
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,623
I looked at the site.

158
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,659
And you think? What?

159
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,995
Oh My God! Asif! What is this?

160
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,599
What happened sweetheart?

161
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,931
Asif!

162
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,622
Hasina has picked up ten
new salwar suits from India.

163
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,352
All so beautiful!

164
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,756
Is the spinach good?

165
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,422
You're reading Antigone in school?

166
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,556
Yes.

167
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,327
Is the Spinach good or not?

168
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,235
Ma, can you make fish tomorrow?

169
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,497
Sophocles?

170
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,630
Yes.

171
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,867
Hasina's niece is getting married.

172
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,837
I was wondering when in our house..

173
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,403
The Spinach is great Ma.

174
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,439
Naughty girl!

175
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,916
Ma, will you make fish tomorrow?

176
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,710
Why not, my lovely.

177
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,285
Ask your father to give me more money

178
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,552
then I'll make whatever you want.

179
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,287
Why speak like that to the children?

180
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,953
Why say things like that?

181
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,689
Oh God! ..now what did I say?

182
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,870
Of course you can
have fish tomorrow Asif.

183
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll go buy it myself.

184
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,375
It's amazing how Antigone
took on the whole of Greece

185
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,377
when she stood up for
her brother like that.

186
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,737
See Rizu!

187
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,712
How my daughter thinks!

188
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,376
But, I think Creon was
right when he punished her.

189
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,645
Who is Creon?

190
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,811
King of Greece Ma.

191
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,979
What did he do?

192
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,213
Antigone wanted to bury
her brother in a decent way.

193
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,383
What's wrong with that?

194
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,223
Her brother was a traitor
and so she was punished.

195
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,696
But her brother comes first.

196
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,938
Being King comes with
all kinds of challenges.

197
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,737
He was trying to choose
the lesser of the two evils.

198
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,402
This is the problem in our house.

199
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,873
Even Hasina was asking

200
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,880
if we ever have any normal
conversations around here.

201
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,678
If you were King, you
would do the same thing?

202
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,843
I think so.

203
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,011
Wow!

204
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,311
Normal, what is that?

205
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,479
I can't explain.

206
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,818
Normal is boring ma.

207
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,414
Normal is boring ma.

208
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,617
Stop laughing you twerp!

209
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,625
Pig!

210
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,683
Asif!

211
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,955
She started it.

212
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,424
Saira!

213
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,360
If I were king, I would
give everyone Play-stations

214
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,231
and make homework extinct!

215
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,900
Great strategy Asif!

216
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,272
Dumb people are easier to rule!

217
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,615
Do you feel any regret or
remorse about what you did?

218
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,716
Being King comes with
all kinds of challenges.

219
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,485
Right!

220
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,885
You previously stated that

221
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,260
your daughter left
you no possible option

222
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,692
but death.

223
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,995
Yes.

224
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,601
Why is that?

225
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,700
She betrayed my trust.

226
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,249
Did you decide to kill
her in a fit of anger?

227
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,216
No.

228
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:28,186
So you're saying you deliberated
over it over a course of time?

229
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,694
I never thought I would ever
be put in a situation like that.

230
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,425
And..

231
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,900
What would have happened

232
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,793
if you had let her live?

233
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,805
She would have been hunted down.

234
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,540
We would have been shunned.

235
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,975
By Who?

236
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,477
By family,

237
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,583
friends,

238
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,355
everybody.

239
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,926
Our community.

240
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,793
So you're saying she
would have died anyway?

241
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,731
Probably.

242
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,902
So in a way you were protecting her?

243
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,836
Yes.

244
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,305
We were protecting ourselves.

245
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,852
From the community, not
from the law obviously.

246
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,846
Sometimes it's the people that

247
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,825
closest to you that cause
you the most pain, Mr James.

248
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,555
Yes. I understand.

249
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,291
Were you an indulgent father?

250
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,409
Saira wants to go to university.

251
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,575
I know. She's my daughter.

252
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,182
And mine?

253
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,688
Yes. But mine first, then yours.

254
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,552
That's not fair!

255
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:12,993
I went through the pains of
carrying her in my womb for 9 months,

256
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,527
and she's yours first?

257
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,391
Absolutely!

258
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,566
She's my daughter first.

259
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,136
So you'll give her
whatever she wants?

260
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,947
And more, if I could.

261
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,249
Spoil her and pay the price.

262
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,447
Did you know, that Birmingham
has more canals than Venice.

263
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,419
Really?

264
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,788
Yup.

265
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,425
But I'd rather be in
Venice than Birmingham.

266
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,532
I'm shocked. You're not
proud of being Brummie?

267
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,941
It's not that I'm not proud, David.

268
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,840
I just don't feel free in Birmingham.

269
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,342
Me and you.

270
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,976
Venice.

271
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,182
We're going to sail on the canals,

272
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,743
rent a cheeky little room

273
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,187
and we can both write
to our hearts content.

274
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,382
Dreamer..

275
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,584
I wouldn't be a writer otherwise.

276
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,186
You can make us both some pasta.

277
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,629
No. You can.

278
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,667
I can see us now.
You'll be writing away

279
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,702
and I'll be taking care of the
cleaning, the washing, the cooking.

280
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,703
Damn right! I'm no ordinary woman.

281
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,741
Really? Then why are
your knickers on the inside?

282
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,201
That's old school.
Superwomen today don't wear get ups.

283
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,807
What do they wear?

284
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,675
Nothing.

285
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,282
Nothing?

286
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,549
Well you better take
your clothes off then.

287
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,820
Stop it.
- Nobody is looking.

288
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,702
Rizu, I have something to tell you.

289
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,770
I can't protect Saira
if she's away from me.

290
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,712
Your daughter is a smart..

291
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,547
..Smart girl, I know.

292
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,018
And I know she knows the difference
between right and wrong.

293
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,991
But I'm just scared
she'll move far away from us.

294
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:31,200
She'll start to hate the
ways of her own people

295
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,795
and if this happens,
then where will she go?

296
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,903
What will she do?

297
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,743
I might never be
able to forgive myself.

298
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:55,591
You've never once made her
feel like she was a girl.

299
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,426
Maybe that's my mistake.

300
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,303
The people who committed the crime,

301
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,597
how were they related to you?

302
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,005
Riyaaz.

303
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,739
He's my older brother.

304
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,539
And the others?

305
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,875
Cousins.

306
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,610
And you asked them to do this?

307
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,219
They volunteered.

308
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,354
Where is your brother now?

309
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,225
I'm not sure.

310
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,357
Would you say your brother
was a Is he a conservative man?

311
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,230
It depends on what you
mean by conservative.

312
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,428
I'm sure you know what
it means, professor.

313
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,904
I think it's relative.

314
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,743
Did he force your hand?

315
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,846
I'm a grown man Mr. James.

316
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,249
I did everything with full
knowledge of the consequences.

317
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,491
Hi!

318
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,572
What's up with you?

319
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,672
Az, you know I won't tell anyone.

320
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,778
Were you happy slapped?

321
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,622
I heard about it Az.

322
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,858
It's nothing to be ashamed about.

323
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,355
It could happen to anyone.

324
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,267
I've got a secret too.

325
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,774
I have a boyfriend.

326
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,971
Really?

327
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,337
Yeah.

328
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,641
Who?

329
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,541
His name is David.

330
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,647
He studies at the university.

331
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,680
He's white?

332
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,682
Yeah.

333
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,951
He's a really nice though.

334
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,925
I think you'd get on
really well with him.

335
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,957
Baba's not going to like it.

336
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,690
Why?

337
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,266
I don't know.
I just get this feeling.

338
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,334
We're not white.

339
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,363
Saira!

340
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,599
Asif!

341
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,438
Don't tell them Saira.

342
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,683
Praise the Lord!
What a beautiful house!

343
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,517
Saira!

344
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,890
Asif!

345
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,590
But Rizwana's strong
voice hasn't changed.

346
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,223
All of India still remembers it.

347
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,770
I wanted to install
an intercom at home

348
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,206
but Asif asked what's the point?

349
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,604
Just tell Mum.

350
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,300
The whole neighborhood will hear it.

351
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,507
Bhai jaan, I'll only stop when all
my shouting has the desired effect.

352
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,709
No Rizu.

353
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,948
He listens with one ear
and takes it out the other.

354
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,448
Brother! You've just arrived

355
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,825
and already causing
friction between husband and wife?

356
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,422
After all, what are brothers for?

357
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,291
Assalam waleykum bade abb...

358
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,362
You remember Saira, brother Riyaaz?

359
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,782
Cover your head.

360
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,757
Where's Asif?

361
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,993
Asif!

362
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,372
Where's Asif?

363
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,607
I'll go help mum.

364
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,710
Ammi.

365
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,157
Ammi.

366
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,289
How was your flight bhai jaan?

367
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,796
Good! Very good.

368
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,963
What's the situation now
with these white people?

369
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,566
Is it still the same?

370
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,235
I think if you've made it
home without an interrogation

371
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,744
or have not been arrested
for 42 days without charge,

372
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,408
I think we're ok.

373
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,451
Asalam Waleykum Bade Abb...

374
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,617
Aleykum wasalam my little tiger!

375
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,592
The two of us will put
those bullies right. Ok?

376
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,293
Good boy.

377
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,850
What happened to
your beard, Bade Abbu?

378
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,915
It's all because of
these white people.

379
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,454
We've heard horror stories of how
they torture anyone with a beard.

380
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,558
They're wimps, these white people.

381
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,223
Bread, bhai jaan.
- Thank you.

382
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,857
You can't blame them.

383
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,899
Even we are scared.

384
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,898
Only the weak know fear.

385
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,575
How old are you, Saira?

386
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,172
17 Bade Abbu.

387
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,906
That's what I thought.

388
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,710
Why Bade Abbu?

389
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,581
Don't question him.

390
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,379
I'm sure Bade Abbu had
good reason to ask Saira.

391
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,526
I have a proposal for you.

392
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,767
Saira is getting married?

393
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,498
Asif!

394
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,538
Good family Nazir.

395
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,509
Very good family.
All textile merchants in Lucknow.

396
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,306
Father would have
approved whole-heartedly.

397
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,640
This is important Riyaaz bhai.

398
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,151
It needs some serious thought.

399
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,917
It needs no further discussion.

400
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,892
Have some more curry Riyaaz bhai

401
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,860
and Rizwana has made
her famous bread pudding.

402
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,907
My favorite.

403
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,649
Ma! What's going on?

404
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,685
Did you know about this proposal?

405
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,622
Ya allah! Saira!

406
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,420
Did you tell Baba
I want to go to Uni.

407
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,659
Ma?

408
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,668
He will speak to you.

409
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,473
I have a feeling
he's not going to send me.

410
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,678
He will talk to you, Saira.

411
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,939
Don't worry.

412
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,780
Ma, you can tell me.

413
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,273
I don't know anything.

414
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,512
Ma, if Asif wanted to go to college,

415
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,318
would it be such a problem?

416
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,751
All I want to do is study further.

417
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,856
All my teachers say I'm talented,

418
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,955
Don't you think so too Ma?

419
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,227
Saira, Baba will do
what he thinks is right.

420
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,506
Bade Abbu is strange, Ma.

421
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,935
I don't like him.

422
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,943
I've dreamt about it for so long.

423
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,741
Why couldn't you just tell me.

424
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,917
Oh God! This girl wants
a reason for everything.

425
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,790
Instead of
questioning them so much, try

426
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,259
and understand your
father's ways, my child.

427
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,214
Saira had to be an
example to other girls.

428
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,021
She was a bright girl.

429
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,351
And she let you down.

430
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,762
She was 17.

431
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,529
Maybe your
expectations were too high?

432
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,969
I don't think so.

433
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,679
When you found out
about the boyfriend,

434
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,748
did you feel cheated?

435
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,518
I felt like she forgot

436
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,287
I was around.

437
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,923
She didn't tell you about him.

438
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,500
Why?

439
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,703
I don't know.

440
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,944
Do you think she knew what
she was doing was wrong?

441
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,512
That's what I don't understand.

442
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,351
She knew.

443
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,787
Why did she do it?

444
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,259
Maybe she knew you would be angry.

445
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,831
You're from India?

446
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,266
Pakistan.

447
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,935
So you understand
what she put me through?

448
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,380
I don't know if I do.

449
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,182
How can you not?

450
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,548
It's in your blood.

451
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,255
I still remember

452
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,392
how angry Abbu was when he
found out you wanted to go abroad.

453
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,400
I didn't know what to do.

454
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,532
I was so scared of
confronting him about it.

455
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,403
He knew you were happy here,

456
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,737
but I think he would have
loved for you to come home.

457
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,939
I think he was
scared for the children.

458
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,475
Really?

459
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,316
He never shared all this with me.

460
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,285
I don't think he wanted to
influence your decisions.

461
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,986
And he didn't want to seem weak.

462
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,595
An old tree may bend,
but it will not break.

463
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,594
I wish he was still with us.

464
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,929
I still regret
leaving on such a bad note.

465
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,932
You can turn regret
into opportunity Naz.

466
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,573
What do you mean?

467
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,885
Have you thought any more
about Saira's marriage?

468
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,917
She..she wants to study further.

469
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,260
And you?

470
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,994
What do you want?

471
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:50,436
I certainly don't want my children
to make the same mistakes as me.

472
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,265
Then don't Naz.

473
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,878
This family is excellent.

474
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,406
Saira will be very happy
there and you can come back home.

475
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,275
That would be nice.

476
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,918
And if her husband allows it,
she can study there also.

477
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,884
Rizwana will be thrilled!

478
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,588
We will all be together one again.

479
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,658
Give me some time to work it out.

480
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,345
David, will you marry me?

481
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,551
What?

482
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,787
It's the only way out.

483
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,387
If I'm married, my parents
can't force me to anything.

484
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,693
Saira, please.

485
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,299
Just wait for my book,
I'll go see them.

486
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,199
It's got nothing to
do with money David.

487
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,565
Saira, you're scaring me.

488
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,972
Please David? We'll get
married and live just as we dreamed.

489
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,906
You're in school Saira.

490
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,839
You don't want to marry me?

491
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,516
Just tell me, you
don't want to, do you?

492
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,416
I would love to marry you.

493
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,820
But I want to marry
you in the right way.

494
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,652
When I know I can take
care of you properly.

495
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,623
We're not doing anything wrong.

496
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,023
There's no point.

497
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,223
You're not going to understand.

498
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,798
Understand what Saira?

499
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,594
I'm sorry.

500
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,797
No don't be.

501
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,170
You're right. I'm being stupid.

502
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:32,968
Saira.

503
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:33,971
I've got to go.

504
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,734
Saira. Wait please.

505
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,904
Saira.

506
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,500
He's obviously come with a purpose.

507
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,576
I told you.

508
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,410
I know Riyaaz bhai really well.

509
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,582
Did you tell him
about Saira's plans?

510
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,316
Yes. I did.

511
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:31,357
I think, Rizu, it's time
that we all went back home.

512
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,266
Really?

513
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,636
Why not?

514
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,743
I'm almost done with
my tenure as professor

515
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:48,205
and Saira's wedding can
take place in Lucknow.

516
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,686
So this means you've
accepted the proposal?

517
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,346
I've given my word already.

518
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,648
Without asking Saira?

519
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,861
I will speak to her.

520
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:06,497
You accepted the
proposal without asking her?

521
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,738
Why? What if she says no?

522
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,375
Rizu, why would she say no?

523
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,574
I've made my decision.

524
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,610
We are all going back to India.

525
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,790
Rizu. What's wrong
with what I've done.

526
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,493
Our marriage was also arranged.

527
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,264
Saira is not like us, Nazir.

528
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,167
Times have changed.

529
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
You're forcing Saira to get married.

530
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,240
I'm not forcing her.

531
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,744
She's my own flesh and blood.

532
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,242
I know her every heartbeat.

533
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,882
I'm her father.

534
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,818
I would never wish ill upon her.

535
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,384
And do you really think,

536
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,487
I don't want her to be happy?

537
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,136
Did you hear what he said to me?

538
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,841
Yeah.

539
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,316
Why should I understand?

540
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,354
Well, it's the man
woman thing, isn't it?

541
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,614
What?

542
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,189
The gender thing.

543
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,554
Men have it all,
women are possessions.

544
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,682
That's right, isn't he?

545
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,818
Is that what you think?

546
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,260
Not about you.

547
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,428
But Asians in general, yeah.

548
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,494
What is wrong with you?

549
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:54,539
Oh Come on Farah.
It's in your blood.

550
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,511
It's tradition, it's religion.

551
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,377
It's got nothing to do
with religion.

552
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,642
Really?

553
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,320
Are you saying that his religion
allows him to do what he did?

554
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,854
I think it plays a role.

555
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,514
It does not.

556
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,653
You seem convinced.

557
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,587
I am.

558
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,260
Statistics say otherwise.

559
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,424
I don't think that's accurate.

560
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,701
Then prove me wrong. Go on!

561
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,530
Go on!

562
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,204
Prove it!

563
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,448
Saira!

564
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,752
Baba! ls Bade Abbu home?

565
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,753
No.

566
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,352
Asif has taken him sight seeing.

567
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,591
Poor Asif!

568
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,792
Saira!

569
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,635
I don't like him Baba!

570
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,872
You'll get used to him.

571
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,266
Why do I have to?

572
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,584
Ma?

573
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,360
What?

574
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,855
We have something
we'd like to tell you.

575
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,237
You're marrying me off, aren't you?

576
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,829
The family is broad minded,

577
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,465
they are willing to
let you study further.

578
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,335
Baba, I don't want to be married.

579
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,244
It's better for you to be somewhere
where you're protected Saira.

580
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,550
Please Baba. I don't want to.

581
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,387
Why not?

582
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,627
I. I don't know. I want to study.

583
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,956
You can do both.

584
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,792
Do you know the boy?

585
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,030
We will all move. The
family will be together again.

586
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,237
Do you know what he looks like?

587
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,669
It will be a grand celebration.

588
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,331
What does he do Baba?

589
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,875
You'll be fine. Saira.

590
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,639
Would I put you in wrong hands?

591
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,271
I don't want to leave England.

592
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,541
We have to.

593
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,546
We will all move.

594
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,749
So this is it.

595
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,953
You're marrying me off to
someone you don't even know?

596
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,761
You're forcing me?

597
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,729
I think it will be best for you.

598
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:33,962
She'll be fine.

599
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,606
Hey!

600
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,016
Hey! What happened?

601
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,546
We're leaving.

602
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,611
What?

603
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,883
To India.

604
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,919
To India?

605
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,556
They've fixed my wedding.

606
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,556
My father doesn't even
know who the boy is.

607
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,700
Are you serious?

608
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:06,927
Yes.

609
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,504
What about David?

610
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,433
I don't know.

611
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,704
To talk to him but

612
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,535
he doesn't seem to understand
how serious the matter is.

613
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,580
Maybe it's better this way.

614
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,772
I don't want to go to India.

615
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,609
Saira, I know you're scared.

616
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,210
I really want to be with David.

617
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,985
That will be bad
for the both of you.

618
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,556
I love him.

619
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,525
Saira, you knew it wasn't
going to work outwith him.

620
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,765
Look. I think you
should talk to your dad.

621
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,493
Tell him. He doesn't
know what's going on.

622
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,798
He thinks he's doing
what is best for you.

623
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,964
Talk to him.

624
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,300
Ok.

625
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,507
Ok. Bye.

626
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,786
Bade Abbu?

627
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,362
If a boy doesn't like to fight,
is that bad?

628
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,330
He's not going to get very far.

629
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,959
Nothing comes for free Asif.

630
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,328
Baba doesn't fight.

631
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,305
Yes he does.

632
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,204
He does?

633
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,442
Punching someone in the face is
not the only way to fight, Asif.

634
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:32,347
He works hard every day to
protect three important things.

635
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:38,452
In Urdu we say Zar, Zan, Zameen.

636
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,928
Land, Gold, Women.

637
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,602
Land, what like the
ground or something?

638
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,770
Like your house, your home.

639
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,933
Women, like mum and Saira?

640
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,270
We don't have any Gold.

641
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,375
Gold doesn't mean
just the metal Asif.

642
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,916
Gold symbolizes that
which is precious.

643
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,022
What's the most
precious thing you own?

644
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,917
It would have to be my PlayStation.

645
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:19,298
Well, if someone took those
away from you, would you be angry?

646
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:20,661
Very.

647
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,167
Why?

648
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,563
Because they're mine.

649
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,833
Exactly.

650
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,500
Come.

651
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,608
As you grow into a man,

652
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,838
you'll be responsible
for a lot of things.

653
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,246
Like your home and
your family, your people.

654
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:41,254
You have to protect everything
you take responsibility for.

655
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,850
Kids in school think I'm a wimp.

656
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,193
Your reputation is as
important as your Playstations.

657
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,392
Claim it back.

658
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,429
Change it! Prove them wrong.

659
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,530
Some times I feel like killing them!

660
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,808
To die protecting what is yours,

661
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,373
what could be more
honorable than that?

662
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,240
But isn't fighting wrong?

663
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,276
There is no man on Earth,
worth his salt,

664
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,585
who will not fight to
protect what is his.

665
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,756
Men go to war, they kill each other

666
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,558
to protect their power, their homes,

667
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:27,768
their honour, their reputation,
and their women.

668
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,500
So what should I do?

669
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,666
Stand up to those bullies Asif.

670
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,203
We'll make a proper
man out of you yet.

671
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:40,980
And Baba won't be mad?

672
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,518
Your Baba is made up of
the same blood as me Asif.

673
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,319
Someone who will fight to
protect what he believes is right.

674
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,622
Just like you, Asif.

675
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,297
Try as hard as you might,
you just can't escape that.

676
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,794
C'mon.

677
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,298
The first step toward becoming
a strong man is eating well.

678
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,338
We don't want to be late.

679
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,247
Baba?

680
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,408
Shh.

681
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,551
Baba I have something to tell you.

682
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,551
Shh. Go to sleep.

683
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,322
I can't sleep Baba.

684
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,894
Everything will be ok.
I'm right here with you.

685
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,487
Baba. Please let me speak.

686
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,501
You remember how scared
you used to be of the dark?

687
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,203
I used to write so much poetry then.

688
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,600
I remember them all.

689
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,382
Everyone says you're a lot like me.

690
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,654
When I first glimpsed into your eyes

691
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,385
I saw the world as a child again.

692
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,827
With every touch of your little hands.

693
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,821
Life began, for me, again.

694
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,730
My every memory of you will live,

695
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,327
As long as there is life in me.

696
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,768
Everyone says you're a lot like me.

697
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,507
With every small step you took,

698
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,945
I learnt to walk a little too.

699
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,206
To stand, to fall, to try again,

700
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,545
If anyone taught me this, it's you.

701
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,419
All those little steps you took,

702
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,424
ls etched in vivid memory.

703
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:11,891
Everyone says you're a lot like me.

704
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,901
Tears would well up
in my eyes before,

705
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,267
They rolled down your little face.

706
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:29,908
The thought of you being married off.

707
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:36,618
The dreams I had for you are still.

708
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:42,591
Everyone says you're a lot like me.

709
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,387
You've said in your police interview

710
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,589
that you were provoked to kill.

711
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,559
Yes.

712
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,195
Why?

713
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,227
How were you provoked?

714
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,665
Her actions forced me to deal
with the situation in the way I did.

715
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,468
You mean having a boyfriend?

716
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,474
We don't indulge in
flippant relationships.

717
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,911
We were led to believe they
were serious about each other.

718
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,618
That's not a decision
she makes by herself.

719
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,780
There's no way he would have
found a place in my house.

720
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,484
Because of his skin colour?

721
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,291
So it wouldn't matter what he did.

722
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,797
He was white and that's that.

723
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,232
He was different.
White, black, yellow.

724
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,693
It makes no difference.

725
00:49:55,759 --> 00:50:01,607
Naseer. Isn't that a little racist?

726
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,977
I think every father is,
when it comes to his daughter.

727
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,320
Except now you've lost her for good.

728
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,254
I lost her the minute she met him.

729
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,624
I didn't think you'd come.

730
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,257
Me neither.

731
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,441
What are you going to tell them?

732
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:37,436
Saira. We are not
doing anything wrong.

733
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,440
Maybe you're not, but I am.

734
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,245
Having a boyfriend?
What's wrong with that?

735
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,015
I don't know.

736
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,847
It's just not allowed.

737
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,425
I think they're scared
because they don't know me.

738
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,825
I'll speak to them.

739
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,263
I will, I promise.

740
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,012
You really believe
in this that much?

741
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,989
I'm scared for you David.

742
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,551
Don't be.

743
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,726
What about money,
family, jobs like you said?

744
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:32,994
You'll be married to
author David Reed Saira.

745
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:39,363
We'll have a lovely country
house with a huge library,

746
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,535
a cook that can make
us our favourite dishes

747
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,309
and a maid who can look
after the kids while we..

748
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,349
How many kids?

749
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,417
Four?

750
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,383
Four?

751
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,317
Five?

752
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,251
You want five kids?

753
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,620
Alright then, 3 for you, 3 for me.

754
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,417
I just want two.

755
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,232
Why Saira?

756
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,598
Why?

757
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,506
Why do something like this?

758
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,647
Who can possibly protect you now?

759
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,420
What will your father do now?

760
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,496
And your uncle Riyaaz?

761
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,973
I tried to tell Baba yesterday.

762
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,168
What?

763
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,744
Tried to tell him.

764
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,303
He didn't listen.

765
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,587
My innocent child, look at yourself.

766
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,758
You're a girl.

767
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,287
Girls don't do things like this.

768
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,292
Girls obey, they don't rebel.

769
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,433
I didn't ask to be a girl.

770
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,809
The word of marriage has been given.

771
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:14,221
Now how am I going to protect you?

772
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,862
How am I going to save you?

773
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:37,012
Can you remember the moment when
you decided to kill your daughter?

774
00:54:39,177 --> 00:54:40,247
Yes.

775
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:46,957
Could you tell me,
exactly, what were you thinking?

776
00:54:50,656 --> 00:54:53,694
Handing down tradition
is my responsibility.

777
00:54:56,695 --> 00:55:02,168
To establish a sense of belonging
for my children is my responsibility.

778
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,076
I didn't do it.

779
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,910
I failed.

780
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:13,014
That's what you thought?

781
00:55:14,012 --> 00:55:15,150
You failed.

782
00:55:16,448 --> 00:55:17,688
Yes.

783
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,765
She made me look
like a complete failure.

784
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:26,269
You should have
heard what people said.

785
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:28,233
What my wife..

786
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,899
What my wife had to go through.

787
00:55:32,264 --> 00:55:34,369
Why do you care so much
about what people say?

788
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,942
Because it's important.

789
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:40,144
We survive on reputation alone.

790
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,110
You do too.

791
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:44,882
Does killing your
daughter make you look good?

792
00:55:44,943 --> 00:55:46,820
Don't pretend like
you don't understand.

793
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,084
Why should I understand.

794
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:49,318
Because you're Asian.

795
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:53,290
All Asians are not like you.

796
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:57,423
Miss Siddiqui, I would advice you
not to get aggressive with my client.

797
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:03,967
That boy.

798
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:08,038
He must have brainwashed her.

799
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:14,042
Who is he?

800
00:56:16,408 --> 00:56:17,751
What is his name?

801
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,992
He works at the library.

802
00:56:25,317 --> 00:56:27,058
His name is David.

803
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:31,024
Works in the library?

804
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:34,766
He wants to be a writer.

805
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:40,408
You knew about all this?

806
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,703
I found out yesterday.

807
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:52,984
I can't believe it.

808
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:01,024
How can Saira?

809
00:57:01,787 --> 00:57:02,891
Saira!

810
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:15,210
From now on, she will
not leave the house.

811
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:18,873
Ok?

812
00:57:27,012 --> 00:57:28,150
SAIRA

813
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:29,351
Kiran!

814
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:32,086
I'm sorry Saira.

815
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:35,323
You know?

816
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:39,858
I'm the one that phoned.

817
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:41,029
What are you talking about?

818
00:57:41,393 --> 00:57:46,741
I told my sister who told my mother.

819
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:49,711
My mother made me call your house.

820
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:51,139
You told them?

821
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:55,150
I'm sorry Saira.
They were seriously angry.

822
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:02,247
Saira? What did you do?

823
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:07,797
Did you the find out about?

824
00:58:12,257 --> 00:58:13,668
You better run.

825
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,198
Where will I go?

826
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:19,335
Somewhere where they can't find you.

827
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:25,442
Asif, what's wrong with Baba.

828
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,080
He wasn't like this before.

829
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:32,885
Maybe he was, we just didn't know.

830
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,821
I don't feel like I know him any more.

831
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,159
I'll try and talk to them.

832
00:58:42,888 --> 00:58:43,958
Really?

833
00:58:44,823 --> 00:58:45,927
Yeah.

834
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:47,829
Try and sleep.

835
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:51,402
Asif.
- Yeah.

836
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:53,671
Thanks.

837
00:59:04,843 --> 00:59:06,652
She's an outcaste now.

838
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:08,880
I will not stand for this any longer.

839
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,423
She doesn't belong to
this family any more!

840
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,061
Watch what you say, Riyaaz bhai.

841
00:59:13,118 --> 00:59:14,859
You're talking about my daughter.

842
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:20,031
Because of your daughter, all the
girls in our family will now suffer.

843
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:26,270
In one night,
she's destroyed our reputation.

844
00:59:26,698 --> 00:59:27,870
In one night.

845
00:59:29,868 --> 00:59:32,041
Who will want a relationship
with our family now?

846
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:33,877
You're making too much of it.

847
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:35,885
They were just talking
in the library.

848
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:41,318
A young boy and a young girl,
behind closed doors, just talking?

849
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:45,720
Don't be a fool Nazir!

850
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:52,265
That asshole has
ruined everything for us.

851
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:58,935
I want to.. - No bhai jaan,
you will do nothing of the sort.

852
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:07,015
Don't force me to think that
you've become one of them.

853
01:00:13,178 --> 01:00:14,316
Pack your things.

854
01:00:15,347 --> 01:00:17,657
We will leave for India in two days.

855
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:22,159
Let's get out of here
before the word gets out.

856
01:00:50,115 --> 01:00:52,755
Ask her to leave the room at once.

857
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:02,866
Leave the room Saira.

858
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:10,305
I'll bring the food up to your room.

859
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:12,709
Why are you listening to him Baba?

860
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:15,410
What happened to us?

861
01:01:16,274 --> 01:01:18,982
Did you think about us when
you were locked up with that boy?

862
01:01:21,413 --> 01:01:22,858
I wish you would meet him.

863
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:25,659
He's just like you.

864
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:27,754
Go upstairs before I
lose my temper with you.

865
01:01:31,156 --> 01:01:32,191
Baba.

866
01:01:33,325 --> 01:01:34,633
I'm sorry.

867
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:39,101
Please can we just sit and talk?

868
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:46,643
I have nothing to say to you.

869
01:01:49,307 --> 01:01:50,684
Baba..

870
01:01:51,976 --> 01:01:53,148
Go upstairs!

871
01:02:03,755 --> 01:02:04,927
Go!

872
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:31,819
He doesn't seem to be imbalanced.

873
01:02:33,051 --> 01:02:34,724
He doesn't even
seem to have a temper.

874
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:37,826
No matter what I
think all we have got is.

875
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:41,359
All we've got is
religion and culture.

876
01:02:42,894 --> 01:02:44,669
Don't you see what you're doing?

877
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:46,769
If you defend him on those grounds..

878
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,208
..You're branding
the whole community.

879
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:49,703
No I'm not.

880
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:52,036
Every murdering father or uncle..

881
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:53,776
..That even thinks about
doing the same to his children..

882
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:55,374
..Can claim the same defence.

883
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,616
People will be weary of us.

884
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:01,089
Leave religion
and culture out of it.

885
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:02,386
I don't think so.

886
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:05,354
I'm one of them.
A British Asian Muslim.

887
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,722
And nowhere
in the Koran does it say,

888
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:10,232
Kill your daughter
if she doesn't listen to you.

889
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:13,858
I'm sorry Ma

890
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,966
I never intended to
hurt you or anyone.

891
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:29,872
Please Ma! Won't you talk to me?

892
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:33,907
I was proud of you once..

893
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,042
..Today I'm only ashamed.

894
01:04:41,779 --> 01:04:43,656
Look at the state of your father.

895
01:04:47,185 --> 01:04:48,664
Go upstairs Saira.

896
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:51,826
Go!

897
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:56,695
Don't come downstairs.

898
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:25,399
Where's Saira?
- That's none of your business.

899
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,232
Look Mr. Khan. I'm not
here to cause any trouble.

900
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:33,306
How long have you known my daughter?

901
01:05:36,601 --> 01:05:37,875
About a year.

902
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,380
Did she initiate the
conversation or did you?

903
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:44,284
Does it really matter?

904
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:47,413
If you could please
just answer the question.

905
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:52,020
I did.

906
01:05:55,987 --> 01:05:58,058
We always wanted to do everything
with your permission.

907
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,226
<i>- We?</i>

908
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,361
Saira and I.

909
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:11,274
Don't you dare even
for one moment assume..

910
01:06:11,336 --> 01:06:13,213
..That you have a
place in this house.

911
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:14,742
I don't think he meant it like that.

912
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:18,253
You have no right indulging your
feelings without my permission.

913
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:23,119
I have feelings for her Sir, not.

914
01:06:24,816 --> 01:06:27,126
Let me kill this
bastard once and for all.

915
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:28,729
Riyaaz bhai!

916
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,226
Please.

917
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:43,836
You lay a finger on me,
I'll go to the police.

918
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:50,047
You have no idea what
you've put us through.

919
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:58,954
If you ask Saira what she wants,
it might help solve this situation.

920
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:02,798
She doesn't know what she wants.

921
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:05,890
She is a child.
- She's an adult now.

922
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:08,335
She has the right to
make decisions for herself.

923
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:16,037
What gives you the right to
speak in that tone, in my house?

924
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,170
You don't let me speak!

925
01:07:17,235 --> 01:07:20,045
This is my daughter
we're talking about!

926
01:07:25,643 --> 01:07:29,216
And I will decide.

927
01:07:31,049 --> 01:07:32,255
What's best for her.

928
01:07:33,284 --> 01:07:36,754
This is ridiculous. I didn't
come here to start a fight.

929
01:07:38,356 --> 01:07:40,029
Before you leave David..

930
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:47,073
I called this meeting to ask
you to stay away from Saira.

931
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:49,402
I know.

932
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,113
I need you to give me your word.

933
01:07:58,976 --> 01:08:00,046
I can't.

934
01:08:07,185 --> 01:08:11,964
I must ask you to give me your word

935
01:08:15,226 --> 01:08:16,330
or else..

936
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:20,136
Who the bloody hell
do you think you are?

937
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:24,271
Where the hell do you come from?

938
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:26,340
I am a citizen of this country too.

939
01:08:27,305 --> 01:08:29,876
You won't belong here till you
start to believe in freedom.

940
01:08:31,743 --> 01:08:35,816
I have the right to
protect my home..

941
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,057
..And my family.

942
01:08:51,095 --> 01:08:52,369
Get out!

943
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,976
Get out!

944
01:09:14,986 --> 01:09:16,397
What an asshole!

945
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:18,893
He has no bloody respect.

946
01:09:21,392 --> 01:09:23,372
What kind of people are these?

947
01:09:26,264 --> 01:09:29,006
They're not going to
see each other again.

948
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:38,845
Our job is done.

949
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:45,056
Does the term 'Honour
killing' mean anything to you?

950
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:49,323
Yes.

951
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:53,965
Would you call this
an honour killing?

952
01:09:54,992 --> 01:09:56,369
Call it what you want.

953
01:09:57,061 --> 01:09:59,007
We could plead under
cultural sensitivity.

954
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:01,271
What does that mean?

955
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:04,939
The sentence for murder is life.

956
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:06,675
There are no two ways about it.

957
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:10,716
Provocation is what
a reasonable man would do.

958
01:10:10,975 --> 01:10:13,751
What you did was wholly unreasonable.

959
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:16,123
Technically you have no defence.

960
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,888
Yes. It's true. But
'life' is a relative term.

961
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:22,193
If we cite religious and
cultural reasons and we prove..

962
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:24,426
..That this is a followed
practice where ever you come from..

963
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,635
..The judge could make
a recommendation..

964
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:28,170
..For a lower prison term.

965
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:31,640
What do you think it will be.

966
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:37,134
For both your charges, 15-20 years.

967
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:39,715
He's a murderer.

968
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,909
What difference does it
make where he comes from?

969
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:45,750
Miss Siddiqui, if you have any
personal recommendations to make..

970
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,255
..Please make them
on your own time.

971
01:10:48,613 --> 01:10:50,149
It makes a bloody
world of difference.

972
01:10:50,214 --> 01:10:51,284
Would he have done it otherwise?

973
01:10:51,349 --> 01:10:52,794
Never heard of a crime of passion?

974
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:53,920
That's different.

975
01:10:53,985 --> 01:10:55,055
How is that different?

976
01:10:55,186 --> 01:10:58,167
A husband, in love with his wife
kills her because she cheats on him..

977
01:10:58,222 --> 01:10:59,997
..Sometimes purely on suspicion.

978
01:11:00,057 --> 01:11:02,264
In some countries, it's
even given legal status!

979
01:11:02,326 --> 01:11:03,396
That's not premeditated.

980
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:04,868
Oh, so that makes it ok?

981
01:11:05,162 --> 01:11:07,039
Does that make it any less brutal?

982
01:11:07,098 --> 01:11:09,408
I don't think this is the right
place to have this conversation.

983
01:11:09,634 --> 01:11:10,806
You should get life.

984
01:11:14,105 --> 01:11:15,243
I already have.

985
01:11:20,845 --> 01:11:23,416
We either run together or
I'm going to call the police.

986
01:11:24,282 --> 01:11:25,352
What did he say?

987
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:28,420
Let's just say, they didn't
exactly lay out the red carpet.

988
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,157
Oh God! David. Please.

989
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:34,226
They're not like this.
I don't understand.

990
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:35,930
I can't leave you with them.

991
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:38,601
Think about it.

992
01:11:38,663 --> 01:11:39,767
I will be at Satours.

993
01:11:40,564 --> 01:11:42,805
David, I'm scared.

994
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:44,372
Trust me ok?

995
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:49,143
I will see you soon.

996
01:13:03,714 --> 01:13:05,387
Why is like this for us?

997
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:08,958
I don't know.

998
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,633
I guess we're not English.

999
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:15,064
Are we not?

1000
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:16,633
I don't know.

1001
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:19,797
Baba really loves you Saira.

1002
01:13:22,366 --> 01:13:24,073
He has a really
funny way of showing it.

1003
01:13:25,703 --> 01:13:27,683
I don't know why
he's so harsh with you.

1004
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,651
But you have to know
he's confused too.

1005
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:38,292
I'm leaving tonight Asif.

1006
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:41,694
Where are you going?

1007
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:43,925
I don't know.

1008
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:50,071
We're not bad people. Are we?

1009
01:15:16,247 --> 01:15:19,751
Asif, go see if Saira's ready.

1010
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:46,316
She's not there.

1011
01:15:48,078 --> 01:15:49,284
She must be in the loo.

1012
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,823
No Baba, she ran away.

1013
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:54,260
Her curtains are
hanging from the window.

1014
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:28,155
You ok?

1015
01:16:34,325 --> 01:16:35,804
You still scared?

1016
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:43,039
He hates me.

1017
01:16:44,134 --> 01:16:45,306
Who?

1018
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:49,774
My dad.

1019
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:55,850
He doesn't hate you.

1020
01:16:57,615 --> 01:17:00,357
He'll come around I'm sure.

1021
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:05,998
When I was little..

1022
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,828
..He used to ask me
to be is best friend.

1023
01:17:11,962 --> 01:17:13,202
What did you say?

1024
01:17:14,131 --> 01:17:15,235
No.

1025
01:17:16,267 --> 01:17:17,678
He was too old.

1026
01:17:21,772 --> 01:17:23,115
He was my hero.

1027
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,092
This is just a difficult time.

1028
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:38,197
I should go back to him.

1029
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:41,029
He needs me.

1030
01:17:45,029 --> 01:17:46,599
What do you think he'll do now?

1031
01:17:48,932 --> 01:17:50,172
I don't know.

1032
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:01,780
You don't feel like you
know him any more do you?

1033
01:18:04,782 --> 01:18:06,693
That's why it hurts.

1034
01:18:08,352 --> 01:18:09,831
I should go back.

1035
01:18:10,988 --> 01:18:14,162
He loves me. I know this.

1036
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:18,806
I love you too.

1037
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,604
We heard what happened.

1038
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:51,799
We're not surprised.

1039
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:53,398
She took advantage of your trust.

1040
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,632
You did the right
thing by telling us.

1041
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:57,144
You gave her too much freedom.

1042
01:18:59,269 --> 01:19:01,749
I can understand your pain Rizwana.

1043
01:19:02,873 --> 01:19:04,944
My daughter has also ran away with.

1044
01:19:05,843 --> 01:19:07,720
Nobody talks to us any more.

1045
01:19:10,114 --> 01:19:11,787
To live has become a crime.

1046
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:18,291
We heard.

1047
01:19:18,722 --> 01:19:19,860
We're here to help.

1048
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,925
Tell us where he lives.
- We'll bring his house down.

1049
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:41,222
That daughter of yours has completely
ruined your reputation, Rizwana.

1050
01:19:41,678 --> 01:19:44,921
Everyone is talking about
how the model Khan family..

1051
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,995
..Has fallen so low.

1052
01:19:48,152 --> 01:19:51,622
It will take years to forget
what Saira did to all of you.

1053
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:53,897
What are you going to do now?

1054
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,243
Mr. Khan, the recommendation
I have prepared will read as follows.

1055
01:20:06,804 --> 01:20:09,614
Nazir Ali Khan of sound body..

1056
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:12,112
..Professor,
University of Birmingham,

1057
01:20:12,176 --> 01:20:15,123
and mind could not reconcile
the fact that his only daughter.

1058
01:20:15,345 --> 01:20:19,657
Saira, had embraced
liberal western values.

1059
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:23,357
His religious and cultural
background prescribed only one

1060
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:29,200
recourse to a perceived
betrayal of trust and that's Death.

1061
01:20:31,028 --> 01:20:33,872
The problem here is
a clash of cultures.

1062
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:37,910
Honour is important to
Asian Muslim people like Nazir.

1063
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:42,739
I therefore, request you to recommend
a maximum sentence of 15 years..

1064
01:20:42,973 --> 01:20:47,649
..In keeping with Mr. Khan's
religious and cultural sensitivities.

1065
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:52,927
Your recommendation skews
the facts on both the religion

1066
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:54,792
and the person it represents.

1067
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:59,292
Honour killing happens among
Christians, Sikhs, Hindus,

1068
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:00,664
The Druze, the Yehidi, the Muslims.

1069
01:21:00,724 --> 01:21:02,294
And none of these
religions condone it.

1070
01:21:02,993 --> 01:21:04,267
Farah, what are you saying?

1071
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:09,143
It's neither Asian nor Islamic.

1072
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:13,080
The roots of this practice lie
in an ancient tribal code..

1073
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:15,013
..And it's followed by
people the world over.

1074
01:21:15,172 --> 01:21:16,708
It predates Islam.

1075
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:19,720
An ancient code?

1076
01:21:21,111 --> 01:21:23,113
So ingrained in
these people's heads..

1077
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:25,421
..They don't even
realise they still follow it.

1078
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:28,823
Miss Siddiqui, please
do not mock my client.

1079
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,094
A code that promotes
killing your daughter?

1080
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:36,067
The woman is responsible
for the honour of the tribe.

1081
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:39,664
She carries their future in her womb.

1082
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,938
That's why relationships
need to be controlled.

1083
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:45,674
A woman must be protected.

1084
01:21:47,271 --> 01:21:50,377
God forbid lose
women taint good blood.

1085
01:21:50,807 --> 01:21:53,913
Miss Siddiqui, this
is my final warning!

1086
01:21:54,678 --> 01:21:56,919
So it's a way of
regulating sexual relations.

1087
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:01,986
Yes. Only the strongest
most trustworthy survive.

1088
01:22:02,052 --> 01:22:03,963
It was true of Middle Age England.

1089
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:08,359
The people in the village would marry
each other to keep the blood pure,

1090
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:11,402
..to protect itself from outsiders,
from strangers.

1091
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:12,800
Yes. Exactly.

1092
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:15,400
It's happened everywhere
at one time or the other.

1093
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:21,749
A woman has always been and still
is man's most precious possession.

1094
01:22:26,643 --> 01:22:29,954
Zar, zan, zameen.

1095
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:34,220
What's that?

1096
01:22:37,287 --> 01:22:38,561
The code.

1097
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:45,606
What does it mean?

1098
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:49,911
A man may kill to
protect three things.

1099
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:51,976
Land, Gold and..

1100
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:57,243
And?

1101
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:05,019
Women.

1102
01:23:15,225 --> 01:23:20,106
Nazir, just give me
permission to handle the situation.

1103
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,939
We'll reclaim everything we've lost.

1104
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:32,552
Do what you feel is
right Riyaaz bhai.

1105
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:37,089
I have nothing left to give.

1106
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:56,936
I think my uncle is
trying to hurt us.

1107
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:00,240
Why?

1108
01:24:04,808 --> 01:24:05,980
Is it because of this?

1109
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,218
He has threatened to kill me Sir.

1110
01:24:09,846 --> 01:24:11,154
How old are you miss?

1111
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:15,054
17.

1112
01:24:18,855 --> 01:24:19,959
<i>I'm 21.</i>

1113
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,236
Are you sure they weren't just angry?

1114
01:24:22,793 --> 01:24:25,399
Angry?
He's threatened to kill us Sir.

1115
01:24:26,797 --> 01:24:28,276
They're not horrible people.

1116
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:34,815
They're just looking after you.

1117
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:36,850
In a round about way.

1118
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,683
I guess.

1119
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,152
I see this as a domestic
issue which will be resolved.

1120
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:52,891
At the moment, I can only give you
the address of the nearest shelter..

1121
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:56,703
..That might be able to provide
you temporary accommodation and food.

1122
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:59,403
But I would suggest,
you call you family.

1123
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:01,709
They must be worried.

1124
01:25:05,235 --> 01:25:09,183
You can't offer us any
protection incase they show up?

1125
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,086
Unfortunately I can't.

1126
01:25:14,077 --> 01:25:15,715
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1127
01:25:21,118 --> 01:25:22,688
What are you going to do?

1128
01:25:24,755 --> 01:25:26,735
She has betrayed our trust.

1129
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:30,069
Saira leaves us no choice.

1130
01:25:31,928 --> 01:25:34,204
Don't worry about the
consequences Riyaaz bhai.

1131
01:25:34,264 --> 01:25:36,005
You can leave for India tomorrow.

1132
01:25:36,733 --> 01:25:39,111
We'll get Nazir the
best lawyers in town.

1133
01:25:39,236 --> 01:25:40,977
He'll get 15 years maximum.

1134
01:25:46,643 --> 01:25:47,815
And for a child?

1135
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:49,255
Even less.

1136
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,628
The court has just
let me know that..

1137
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:03,830
..Your case is going to
be heard in 3 weeks time.

1138
01:26:07,697 --> 01:26:08,801
And.

1139
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:14,371
What happens after that?

1140
01:26:16,106 --> 01:26:17,449
You'll serve your term.

1141
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,285
We will use the code
in your mitigation.

1142
01:26:23,313 --> 01:26:26,920
Do you realise that your social
conditioning is so strong that..

1143
01:26:26,983 --> 01:26:29,361
..Even after all this you
still can't think for yourself?

1144
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,027
That's enough Farah. We should go.

1145
01:26:40,931 --> 01:26:42,342
I do realize that.

1146
01:26:46,403 --> 01:26:48,007
It's people like you..

1147
01:26:48,405 --> 01:26:51,409
..Make life
difficult for the rest of us.

1148
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:03,188
What do you think?

1149
01:27:04,888 --> 01:27:06,094
I don't know Saira.

1150
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:10,770
I just don't know.

1151
01:27:15,165 --> 01:27:16,405
Will it make you happy?

1152
01:27:38,989 --> 01:27:40,093
Thanks very much!

1153
01:27:44,928 --> 01:27:46,373
Well an ancient code.

1154
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:50,407
Who would have thought. Well done!

1155
01:27:51,835 --> 01:27:53,178
It's a sad case though.

1156
01:27:53,803 --> 01:27:56,147
Mind you, he'll get
out after 7-10 years.

1157
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,145
Fantastic, Mr. Timothy James.

1158
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:03,783
Cheers!

1159
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:05,751
I quit.

1160
01:28:06,049 --> 01:28:07,119
I beg your pardon?

1161
01:28:07,317 --> 01:28:08,694
I can't defend this man..

1162
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,361
..And I can't work with you.

1163
01:28:11,755 --> 01:28:14,065
You're letting the stress
and the pressure get to you.

1164
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,895
You're taking this
whole thing too personally.

1165
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:18,197
That brother of his still roams free.

1166
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:20,369
Saira could be here.

1167
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,171
Don't put your
emotions in front of your job.

1168
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:23,802
You always do that. I've told you.

1169
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,910
We're getting a murdering
father off with just 15 years.

1170
01:28:28,905 --> 01:28:30,316
I've got blood on my hands.

1171
01:28:30,707 --> 01:28:31,708
You do too.

1172
01:28:31,775 --> 01:28:32,845
You're not serious.

1173
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,987
I have to find my own way.

1174
01:28:40,283 --> 01:28:41,387
Farah!

1175
01:29:07,944 --> 01:29:09,014
Hello?

1176
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:12,985
Baba?

1177
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:15,989
Saira.

1178
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:19,394
I miss you Baba.

1179
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:25,966
Come home, sweetheart.

1180
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:30,235
David?

1181
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:37,043
Bring him.

1182
01:29:37,907 --> 01:29:39,045
We'll be waiting.

1183
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:44,587
Ok Baba.

1184
01:29:48,118 --> 01:29:49,222
Bye.

1185
01:29:50,086 --> 01:29:51,190
Bye.

1186
01:30:50,146 --> 01:30:52,285
If I stay here.

1187
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:57,288
If I just stay here.

1188
01:30:57,353 --> 01:30:58,764
<i>L</i> just lay.

1189
01:30:58,822 --> 01:31:00,165
Lay here.

1190
01:31:00,356 --> 01:31:05,328
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world.

1191
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:23,018
I didn't know you sing.

1192
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,625
There are lots of things
about me you still don't know.

1193
01:31:27,884 --> 01:31:30,194
Well I can't wait to find out.

1194
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:36,895
If I just lay.

1195
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:42,071
If I just lay here.

1196
01:31:42,799 --> 01:31:48,044
Would you lie with me
and just forget the world.

1197
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:31,217
Baba!

1198
01:32:33,783 --> 01:32:34,853
Baba!

1199
01:32:35,618 --> 01:32:36,790
I missed you, Baba.

1200
01:32:37,654 --> 01:32:38,792
Baba!

1201
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:42,668
Baba. I missed you, Baba.

1202
01:32:51,834 --> 01:32:53,871
Everyone is waiting for you.

1203
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:57,679
Go inside, I'll speak to
David and follow you in.

1204
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,078
Okay, Baba.

1205
01:33:07,183 --> 01:33:09,720
Ma?

1206
01:33:10,253 --> 01:33:12,392
Baba!!

1207
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:15,360
Saira! Saira!

1208
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:19,296
Saira, get the..

1209
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:21,834
Saira!

1210
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:49,995
Saira!

1211
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,612
What are you doing with sister?

1212
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,715
Saira.

1213
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,081
No. Saira.

1214
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:08,687
Saira.

1215
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:43,619
Pry open my sealed lips,
I want to speak.

1216
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:48,294
Break open these shackles
around my wrists, I want to seek.

1217
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:53,762
That noble purpose I had once,
A long way from here.

1218
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:59,397
Let me give myself to those winds,
And get rid of all this fear

1219
01:35:00,697 --> 01:35:04,702
I had begged for you, At every altar.

1220
01:35:06,169 --> 01:35:10,914
With hopeful prayer,
with tearful plea.

1221
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,778
Can I measure you now
against all those wishes?

1222
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:16,985
And break open these
shackles around me?

1223
01:35:17,914 --> 01:35:22,090
Let me give myself to the wind,
And get rid of all this fear.
