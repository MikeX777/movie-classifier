1
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,427
Vodka, straight up.

2
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,727
- My name's Collette.
- Collette?

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,563
What is that,
French I guess?

4
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,627
Wow, you sure know
your stuff.

5
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,898
Paris.

6
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,534
I'm Lloyd.
I'm from Fresno.

7
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,169
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Lloyd.

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,703
Collette... a pretty name
for a pretty miss.

9
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,647
It is miss, isn't it?

10
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,345
Cut the cute stuff, Lloyd.

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,685
I'm available.
All you got to do is pay.

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,528
Another drink for her.
Same for me.

13
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,531
Couldn't help but overhear
your chitchat there.

14
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,590
Not sure Mrs. Lloyd
from Fresno

15
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,761
would appreciate
your dropping this.

16
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,364
Uh, can I help you
in some way?

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,839
Pretty sure not.

18
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,139
Excuse me, the gentleman and I are
having a conversation.

19
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,741
- Doesn't look that gentle to me.
- What do you want?

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,783
I want to take you home.

21
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,483
Hmm.

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,388
It's only my third week
on the job.

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,627
The hours are flexible.
The guys are all right.

24
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,371
Conventions folks mostly...

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,532
computer software,
that sort of thing.

26
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,245
You don't look like
you sell software.

27
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,804
I don't.

28
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,148
Whoa, are you
a movie star?

29
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,565
This place is great.

30
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,040
Uh, what's in the bag?

31
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,082
Toys.

32
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,584
Wow.

33
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,595
Do you have a butler?

34
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,688
Get undressed.
I want to see you.

35
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,393
Everything.

36
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,143
They're real.

37
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,179
It's a scandal.

38
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,959
This is...

39
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,058
strictly against
the rules.

40
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,740
Are your hands clean?

41
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,584
Excuse me?

42
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,088
I'm a little weird
about that.

43
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,316
Please wash them.

44
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,189
With soap.

45
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,246
It's in the shower.

46
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,608
You did good.

47
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,019
Now leave us.

48
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,149
Aren't you
forgetting something?

49
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,692
I don't forget.

50
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,287
- After I've done with her.
- That wasn't the deal.

51
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,559
Don't be trivial.
It's below you.

52
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,262
Try to relax,
sweetness.

53
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,331
Tension makes the flesh
unpleasantly tough.

54
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,536
Tell me where Bishop is
and I'm gone.

55
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,135
In due time.

56
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,239
Now leave me
with her.

57
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,183
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

58
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:36,152
You forget...
this is just a body.

59
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,563
Inside, I am your superior.

60
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,123
Enough!

61
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,332
That's the spirit.

62
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,036
Feel better now?

63
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,206
1653 Kinney Drive.

64
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,773
That's where he is.

65
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,150
Now go.

66
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,922
Mr. Harrison,

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
one more thing:

68
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,968
See you in hell.

69
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,772
Now I feel better.

70
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,938
Listen up. You're bruised
and you're scared but you're alive.

71
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,041
That's the important part.
What's your name?

72
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,211
What's your real name?

73
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,950
That man was gonna eat you, and I don't
mean the euphemism for oral sex.

74
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,390
What's your real name?

75
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,530
Franny.
Franny, Franny, Franny.

76
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,657
Franny, you're gonna
get dressed

77
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,428
and you're gonna
walk out of here

78
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,595
and you're never gonna tell a soul
about me, because if you do...

79
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,366
and look me straight in the eye
when I tell you this...

80
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,964
if you do,
I will find out about it

81
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,010
and I will
come after you.

82
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,481
Take this.

83
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,915
Oh my God.
Oh my god...

84
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,989
Find yourself
a real job, okay?

85
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,996
I swear I'll never
do this again.

86
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,032
- I promise. I promise.
- Go.

87
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,729
- Thank you.
- I said go!

88
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,146
Hello?

89
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,919
Hello!

90
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,660
Anybody!

91
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,791
Please help me!

92
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,233
I swear, I'm not gonna
let her drink the water.

93
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,168
Okay, but I may
let her eat the worm.

94
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,137
I'm kidding! Okay.

95
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,969
All right,
she's on the other line.

96
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,601
I've got to go.
Okay, I love you too.

97
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,043
Bye. Sorry,
that was Mom.

98
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,104
She's worried I'm gonna
corrupt you in Mexico.

99
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,513
Yeah. Okay.

100
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,381
Well, I'll see you tonight.

101
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,886
Okay, Miss Valedictorian.

102
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,586
All right.
I love you. Bye.

103
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,528
Hey. You wanted
to see me?

104
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,566
What do you ask for
every week but never get?

105
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,033
A boyfriend who can make
chocolate souffle?

106
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,627
Hot off the press.
You made the cover.

107
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,673
Oh my God!

108
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,335
- I'm so proud of you!
- I can't believe it!

109
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,968
I've got to say, though,
it creeped me out.

110
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,240
You're getting a little too good
at infiltrating these freak shows.

111
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,908
Tell me about it.
This one got under my skin.

112
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,542
Are we celebrating
tonight or what?

113
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,109
I can't. I'm taking
my little sister

114
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,280
and my mom
out to dinner tonight.

115
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,221
Your family's getting in the way
of your social life.

116
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,054
What do you want?

117
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,991
Is Sadie there?

118
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,188
I've really got to show
her something over here.

119
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,995
Remember that shy girl that wouldn't let
herself be interviewed by the others?

120
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,434
Yeah, J.D. 's cousin Tricia.
I called that number she gave me, but...

121
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,597
But it wasn't
a phone number, right?

122
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,800
- I figured she was blowing me off.
- Yeah, it makes sense.

123
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,969
But I typed in the number twice
and I came to a bookmark.

124
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,513
So I followed the bookmark
to some dorky homepage

125
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,139
filled with a bunch
of wacky links...

126
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,877
Ethan, I don't mean
to be a girl about this,

127
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,851
but you lost me
on "bookmark."

128
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,287
Okay, so I followed
the links and they led me

129
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,587
to dead ends and 404s,
but the line kept going.

130
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,218
And then I started
hitting passwords...

131
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,661
most of 'em basic Java
I could hack no sweat...

132
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,461
Ethan, brilliant man
with monklike patience,

133
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,900
tell me what you've found.

134
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,340
That's it?

135
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,177
Three hours I could...

136
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,549
Three hours I could've spent
watching Brazilian porn

137
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,183
or '70s wrestling gone.

138
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,284
But then I realized
that, in fact,

139
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,693
this page is covered
by a transparent image map.

140
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,732
And this invisible map
leads to?

141
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,963
Bam!
An address in Koreatown.

142
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,527
And, lucky you,

143
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,336
a slot just opened up in my hectic
evening schedule.

144
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,467
Maybe I'll meet
some cute Goth chick.

145
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,479
Ethan, that is so sweet,
but the story's finished.

146
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,913
My little sister just
graduated from high school

147
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,644
and I'm taking her
to Mexico for three days

148
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,686
of nothing but sun
and margaritas.

149
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,381
All right, come on.

150
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,481
Aren't you a little curious?

151
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,956
A little, but these kids
are all posers.

152
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,019
It's "Dungeons and Dragons"
with nipple rings.

153
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,827
It's funny at first,
then it's depressing as hell.

154
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,834
I'm done with it.

155
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay.

156
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,439
Did you get
that gift for Mom?

157
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,603
Um, I put it
in the luggage.

158
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,705
Oh, okay, good.
Don't worry about it.

159
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,135
Ethan, I know
you're screening.

160
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,729
I'm in Koreatown.

161
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,174
Pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

162
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,649
Hello?

163
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,068
What are you doing here?

164
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,229
Nothing. Let go of me.

165
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,829
You are not meant to be here.

166
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,142
All right, so let... ow!

167
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,178
Let go of me, please.

168
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,387
Ethan?

169
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,019
Shit, Ethan.

170
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,063
Ethan?

171
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,331
Hello?

172
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,417
Didn't mean
to startle you.

173
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,819
I'm a friend
of Ethan's.

174
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,119
Oh, hi.

175
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,160
I came to drop off his mail.

176
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,696
- I live just down the hallway.
- That's nice.

177
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,461
I guess I'll... I'll just go.

178
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,801
You brought your purse
from down the hallway, huh?

179
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,536
- Excuse me.
- You looking for your pepper spray?

180
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,776
It's not a very
neighborly gesture.

181
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,720
Do I look
like a rapist?

182
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,848
No, I just... well...

183
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,188
Iook, whatever you...

184
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,058
- Look...
- I'm looking. I'm looking.

185
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,530
You can stop
saying that...

186
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,032
Sadie Blake.

187
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,831
What do you want?

188
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,371
I want to take you
for a drive.

189
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,499
- I don't even know who you are.
- A minor detail.

190
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,566
We could do this the easy way,

191
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,373
but where would be
the fun in that?

192
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,287
We're not here.

193
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,025
Didn't mean to startle you.

194
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,931
The Bishop's almost ready.

195
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,116
Sadie Blake in the flesh.

196
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,918
You know,
I loved your article.

197
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,724
That bit about
all the music

198
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,991
the kids are listening to...
the sludge metal...

199
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,533
and the pig's blood
cocktails...

200
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,398
that was great.

201
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,700
So what are you,
an obsessed reader?

202
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,070
You're prettier
than I expected.

203
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,203
Why am I here?

204
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,942
- To answer some questions.
- I don't know anything.

205
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,183
- Really?
- I swear to God.

206
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,121
Okay.

207
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,575
What is that?

208
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,881
Ethan's head.

209
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,353
Don't tell me that.

210
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,552
Take a look.

211
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,077
You're gonna die too, Sadie.
I'm not gonna lie about it,

212
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,637
so you might as well tell me
what you know.

213
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,047
I don't know anything,
you fucking freak!

214
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,110
Now that
was uncalled for.

215
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,781
- I understand you're upset!
- Don't tell me you understand!

216
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:47,031
Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

217
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,966
God is away
doing God errands.

218
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,469
It's just us here.

219
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,164
So stop being a baby

220
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,139
and tell me
what Tricia told you.

221
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,970
Nothing! She didn't
tell me anything.

222
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,877
Ethan found an address
on some website.

223
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,883
That's all
she told me, I swear!

224
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,885
I wouldn't raise your voice at me
if I were you.

225
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,324
Who else did you
share this with?

226
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,961
Nobody.

227
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,963
I didn't take it seriously

228
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,626
until I read about it
in the newspaper.

229
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,834
Do you know who I am?
What we are?

230
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,641
I... I... I swear to you,
I don't.

231
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,332
You did good,

232
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,598
really good.

233
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,639
Hey, you're a brave girl.

234
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:08,476
You know, I've been around
for a long time,

235
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,877
met a lot of different people,

236
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,178
mostly seen them
do horrible things to each other,

237
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,684
so I'm not so high
on the human race as a whole.

238
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,955
But you're all right.

239
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,384
Time to go.

240
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,259
I'm gonna need
a little longer.

241
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,131
- I don't mind sharing.
- No! No!

242
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,108
No!

243
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,667
Please!

244
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,612
Please don't!

245
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,624
Sex and murder are the only
real pleasures left to man, Sadie.

246
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,964
They fight against them
all their lives and die unfulfilled.

247
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,129
But when you're
one of us,

248
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,366
the two are perfectly
fused into one.

249
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,135
We're lucky that way.

250
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,110
- Please don't do this.
- You don't even know what "this" is.

251
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,113
- I don't want to die.
- Shh.

252
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,649
I've done you no harm.
I'm a good person.

253
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,208
Hippie talk, Sadie. Good and evil
are just imaginary friends.

254
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,924
Wait.
Let's talk about this.

255
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,073
Sexy Sadie,
my sweet and tender prey,

256
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,007
I honestly don't know
what to do first:

257
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,308
fuck you or kill you.

258
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,745
Kill her first.

259
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,997
It's all right.

260
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,501
Oh, please,
get the fuck out of here, will you?

261
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,950
Clyde, what the hell
are you doing here?

262
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,044
- I couldn't sleep.
- You'd better go home.

263
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,721
- Who is she?
- Don't know yet.

264
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,026
No I.D., nothing.

265
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,566
Look, you really should go home.
Why don't I get someone to drive you?

266
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,693
I'm fine.

267
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,897
D.U.I. is the last thing
you need.

268
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,409
Go home to your wife.

269
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,647
Get as far away
from this as you can.

270
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,388
I'll keep you posted.

271
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,334
We need Mrs. Blake
to sign some forms.

272
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,261
Come on, Sadie.
You don't need it that bad.

273
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,721
Oh, thanks a bunch.

274
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,381
God.

275
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,483
- Where are you headed?
- Uh, Santa Barbara.

276
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:40,122
But, you know, anywhere
north works really.

277
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,132
- I'm Alex.
- Is that where you're from?

278
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,533
Uh, San Diego,
but, you know,

279
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,071
I'm just visiting some
buddies from law school

280
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,336
to do a little... a little partying
before next semester.

281
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,708
You like it toasty.

282
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,680
That's cool.

283
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,588
Are you hungry?

284
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,797
I'm good.
Thanks.

285
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,585
Listen, you're not a cop,
are you?

286
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,631
Do I look like a cop?

287
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,862
They wish.

288
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,201
No no no no no.
I'm just asking

289
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,207
'cause I, um...

290
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,175
I was gonna offer you
some weed.

291
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,074
Oh, you go ahead.
I don't mind.

292
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,079
You don't? Okay.

293
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,886
So, Alex,
you got a wife?

294
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,854
No.

295
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,823
Any kids depending on you?

296
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,421
Not that I know of.

297
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,835
What about a girlfriend?

298
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,307
Nope. Not really.

299
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,711
What're you doing?

300
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:50,221
You heard that saying
"Gas, grass or ass..."?

301
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,854
I've seen
the bumper sticker.

302
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,366
Well, with me,
you get all three.

303
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,528
Actually, I do
have a girlfriend.

304
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,628
We all have
our problems, Alex.

305
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,874
Okay, look, I'm gonna take
one more hit before...

306
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,847
Okay, don't mind me.

307
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,263
Coming in,
or are you just gonna watch?

308
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,605
I believe the proper term
is "feast my eyes."

309
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,641
"Feast"? Nobody has ever
called me a feast before.

310
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,081
I would forego
all the bribes in heaven

311
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,743
to feast my eyes on you,

312
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,812
throw my arms around you
and take you home.

313
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,053
Well, you've already
got me home,

314
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,789
so why don't you throw
a towel instead?

315
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,532
What time is
the party tonight?

316
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,530
Midnight.

317
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,504
Mmm. And when
in the world do we eat?

318
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,440
Don't you ever
get hungry?

319
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,768
I eat.

320
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,508
So tell me about
your family.

321
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,248
Mmm.

322
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,223
I don't really talk
to my dad much.

323
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,057
My mom's remarried
and she lives in Reno.

324
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,529
And I have
a sister who was born

325
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,432
a minute earlier than me.

326
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,561
She's a real freak, though.

327
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,696
I was always, like,
the goody two shoes

328
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,763
and she was
very adventurous.

329
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,174
She'll never believe me
when I tell her about you.

330
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,977
- How do you mean?
- Come on.

331
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,710
A straight,
single rich guy

332
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,915
with a sense of humor

333
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,017
who's hung like
an Australian alligator.

334
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,155
Come on, Bishop, I've never
met anyone like you before.

335
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,225
She'll think
I made you up.

336
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,238
I bet you were
an adorable virgin.

337
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,641
So random.

338
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,077
What do you
even mean by that?

339
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,209
Did you bleed much...

340
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,112
your first time?

341
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,557
You really want to know?

342
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,687
Jenny, I once had
a friend who said,

343
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:51,201
"Sex and murder are the only
real pleasures left to man."

344
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,566
You're starting
to freak me out.

345
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,070
I had you going
for a second, didn't I?

346
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,538
I almost gave sweet Jenny
indigestion there, Poe.

347
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,346
You should tell her she can't
be too careful these days.

348
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,411
Rich elegant bachelors
are often psychotic.

349
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,922
- Hmm.
- True.

350
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,761
To Australian alligators.

351
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,836
The blood of Christ...

352
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,474
- You do have a point, though.
- Which one?

353
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:42,110
About sex and murder being
man's main pleasure.

354
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,287
Well, it certainly seems
that way these days.

355
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,825
Not to sound reactionary.

356
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,331
So which one are you
gonna use me for?

357
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,629
Mmm.

358
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,670
Both.

359
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,429
We've got to stop
meeting like this, Clyde.

360
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,438
I'm getting closer.

361
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,701
Closer to getting me fired.

362
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,868
- Don't be an asshole.
- Too late.

363
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:48,578
I tell you what: you make yourself
invisible from now on

364
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,779
and I will keep you
up to date on everything.

365
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,583
He may not keep you
up to date.

366
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,454
Who knows how long it would have
taken for your guys to find this John.

367
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,222
Yeah, point taken.

368
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,622
- Look, how much this means to you...
- Don't.

369
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,532
What I meant was,

370
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,036
I can only imagine.

371
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,733
And I wish you could be part of this
officially, but seeing as how you...

372
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:14,266
It's okay, Joe.
I'll play ball.

373
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,213
But you can't go lifting evidence
from my crime scene.

374
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,780
I sure can.
I'm invisible, remember?

375
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,224
Oh, fuck.

376
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,405
Turn around slow.

377
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,645
Emphasis on slow.

378
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,348
I'll take that phone.

379
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,593
- Where's Bishop?
- He didn't tell me.

380
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,966
You don't need that
with me.

381
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,437
I'm not...
not like you.

382
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,940
World-class
understatement.

383
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,739
As for you being human,
that's purely a technicality.

384
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,780
Humor me here,

385
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,816
how much does Bishop
pay you for this?

386
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,899
I'll make it easy for you.

387
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,738
You just dropped him off
somewhere.

388
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,938
I can't tell you.
He will kill me.

389
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,915
He won't get the chance.

390
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,852
I'm an old man.

391
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,285
Please take mercy.

392
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,949
I'm fresh out just now.

393
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,893
He's running.

394
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,022
He doesn't know
it's you.

395
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,329
He thinks a cop
is after him.

396
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,834
What cop?

397
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:38,398
All he knows is what
happened to the others.

398
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,635
Where is he going?

399
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,238
Don't take pauses because
it makes me think you're lying.

400
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,917
I am not afraid to die.

401
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:58,652
Yeah, well,
death is different now.

402
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,251
Daddy.

403
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,401
- Yeah?
- You awake?

404
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,639
Robin Hood's had a busy night.
Two more bodies.

405
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,841
Maybe we have
a blood sample to match to.

406
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,680
It's a she.

407
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,686
Paid a late-night visit
to a local drugstore,

408
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,415
bought supplies
to dress a knife wound.

409
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,184
Any ideas about
her destination?

410
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,055
We've got a parking-lot surveillance
shot of a license plate.

411
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,596
Yeah.
I got it.

412
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,654
Hello, Bishop.

413
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,558
Poe won't be checking
his messages any longer.

414
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,655
We can discuss that
if you like.

415
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,190
I understand you being
a little raw about it.

416
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,237
We should meet.

417
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,532
I figure you should have
the chance to see my face

418
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,577
before I kill you.

419
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,218
Wonton's.

420
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,998
A man made a call from that phone
back there about 20 minutes ago.

421
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,058
I wonder what you can
tell me about him.

422
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,730
It's a public phone.
Lots of people use it.

423
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,137
This guy was in his 30s,

424
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,903
dark hair, the kind
women might go for.

425
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,945
Oh, and my drink's
red wine.

426
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,107
Are you a cop,
his wife, what?

427
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,848
Cop, lover, baby sister...
really, who cares?

428
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,254
You don't want this guy
as a regular.

429
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,350
Anything you noticed might
help me out big time.

430
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,864
Don't get me wrong,
I'd love to take your money,

431
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,025
but the guy came in,
had a drink,

432
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,126
made a phone call,
that's it.

433
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,262
Did he exit
front or back?

434
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,499
Did you see his car?
Did he talk to anyone here?

435
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:28,271
Nope. I've never
seen him before.

436
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,244
I have to get
tipped, though.

437
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,942
If you ever see him again,
call me at this number

438
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,579
and I'll keep these coming.

439
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,825
"Eve."
Is that your name?

440
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,568
Sorry to bother you,

441
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,162
but I overheard you talking
to the bartender in there.

442
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,038
- You're looking for Bishop, right?
- What do you know about him?

443
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,304
- I know where he's staying.
- He sent you to tell me?

444
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,369
To tell you? No.

445
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,314
- He sent me to take you there.
- I'll get my stuff.

446
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,916
Did I overdo it?

447
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,390
What do you think, dipshit?
Help me.

448
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,693
All right, you take her car
and you meet me there.

449
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,641
What?!

450
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,140
It's a stick.
I can't drive it.

451
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:39,409
- Learn, man.
- But you're the better driver.

452
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:43,418
Dwayne, don't become
a problem.

453
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:46,011
Plus, she has the keys.

454
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,253
What are you doing?

455
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,389
Maybe she's got them
in her breast pocket.

456
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,058
She doesn't have
a breast pocket.

457
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,897
I don't hear
her complaining.

458
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,938
We're sitting ducks here and you're
feeling her up? Come on, man!

459
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,806
Hey, easy, bro.
Can I help it that she's a fox?

460
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,059
Yes?

461
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,065
Hello?

462
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,928
Who is this?

463
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,740
Mom?

464
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,833
Sadie?

465
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,878
Is this you?

466
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,484
Mom, I love you so much.

467
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:15,149
Where... where are you,
honey?

468
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,250
Is this really you?

469
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:22,195
You take good care
of yourself and Beth, okay?

470
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,260
Mom, what are you doing?

471
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,634
It's your sister,
sweetheart!

472
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,798
No, Mom.
Sadie's dead, remember?

473
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,480
Welcome to Mexico.

474
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,209
I'm in Mexico?

475
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,187
Well, technically,

476
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,225
you're still
in California,

477
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,453
but who can tell
the difference, huh?

478
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,087
How are you feeling?

479
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,689
Not great.

480
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,793
Yes, physics will
do that to you...

481
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:26,001
gravity, trucks,
concrete.

482
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,669
You found out the hard way
that you cannot die...

483
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,413
at least not like
regular people.

484
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,416
Who are you?

485
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,476
I am someone who is
very interested

486
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:42,217
in this... this man
you hate so much... Bishop.

487
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,883
You know him?

488
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,893
You were talking
in your sleep.

489
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,226
There's two kinds of people

490
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:52,028
that talk in their sleep:

491
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,399
People who can't shut up,

492
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,768
and people who have
something to say.

493
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,432
Get some rest.

494
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,845
Thank you.

495
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,685
What do you want?

496
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,621
I want to be alive again.

497
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,626
You can't.

498
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:56,290
Ask yourself,
what do you want now?

499
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,774
I want to stop them
from doing this to anyone else.

500
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,003
Open your right hand.

501
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,617
- Then you will do that.
- How?

502
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:35,496
In English, it's "I'm going
to be your godfather."

503
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,472
I will guide you
in your search,

504
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,236
in your work.

505
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,205
But how will I find them?

506
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,145
It is not hard to find those

507
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,842
who don't know that
you're looking for them.

508
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,441
But...

509
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:58,052
Rourke, Eve,
Harrison, Poe...

510
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,890
...Bishop.

511
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,895
Those are their names.
How did you know?

512
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:07,493
I know some people
that can get you over here.

513
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,097
Now it's up to you
to work your way over here.

514
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,308
But you have to start
at the bottom.

515
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,812
You won't make it if you go
straight to Bishop.

516
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,108
Understand?

517
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:30,349
This will help you survive
for a while.

518
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,228
And when it runs out?

519
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,433
I can't do it.

520
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,874
I won't kill
innocent people.

521
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,971
Every war has
its casualties, Sadie.

522
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,949
And don't fool yourself.

523
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:59,419
Nobody's innocent...

524
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,922
nadie.

525
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,528
Nadie.

526
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,206
Hello.
How can I help you?

527
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,811
- What room is Rourke in?
- Room number 310.

528
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,953
Hey!

529
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,984
- What do you want?
- You.

530
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,827
- Lady, what the hell did you do?
- Call the cops.

531
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,461
Tell me where
to find Eve.

532
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,405
- Who are you?
- Where is she?

533
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,638
You're that reporter...

534
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:01,414
who went diggin'...
a little too deep.

535
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,111
If you think I've forgotten my question,
you're sadly mistaken.

536
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,586
- I don't know where she is.
- I'm gonna call the cops!

537
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,316
I thought I already
asked you to.

538
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:13,994
- You really don't know?
- Try a place called The Red Angel.

539
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,554
- She hangs out there, I think.
- You think?

540
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,601
I can take you to her
if it's this important.

541
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,140
It might come as a shock,

542
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,649
how little you feel
about that first kill...

543
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,145
but it would be
a grave mistake

544
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,621
to think that handling Eve
will be as simple.

545
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,887
Don't let her
get inside your head.

546
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,866
Hey!

547
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,609
You're a beautiful woman.

548
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:17,818
- Out.
- Whoa!

549
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,485
- Now.
- Whoa, Miss Hot Shit,

550
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,051
who made you God?

551
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,098
Tell me again what you said
on the dance floor.

552
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,794
I said I can never dance with
a hard-on pressed against my leg.

553
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,632
Oh yeah.
Shit, that is so hot!

554
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,624
Sailor, uh...

555
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,293
this is my sister.

556
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,331
What the fuck is she doing
with that harpoon?

557
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,628
Lord Almighty.

558
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,260
Sadie Blake.

559
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,998
You have a million
questions, I bet.

560
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,063
That's your cue to leave.

561
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,278
Here.

562
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,975
It's okay.

563
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,382
Bishop was done
feeding off you

564
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,391
and still
you wouldn't die.

565
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,587
So he gave you to me
to finish off.

566
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,927
- Why didn't you?
- Believe me, I tried.

567
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,626
But I have never seen
anyone put up such a fight.

568
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:36,967
You didn't have enough blood
left in you for a pulse.

569
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,234
I figured somewhere deep inside
you wanted to stay here.

570
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,038
So you took pity on me,
is that it?

571
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,169
- I owe you?
- You owe it to yourself

572
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,111
to stop hating
what you are

573
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,649
and understand
your fear.

574
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:51,652
Who says I'm afraid?

575
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,312
Fear is where we go
to learn.

576
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,653
That's where you went
for three days.

577
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,285
- Maybe more.
- What are you talking about?

578
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:02,455
It takes three days
to turn someone

579
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,192
and it's a very
delicate process.

580
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,894
Only a handful of us
even know how to do it.

581
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,964
I started you, but you finished it
on your own,

582
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,203
alone in that morgue.

583
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,711
You became one of us because
that's what you wanted.

584
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:21,374
I'm not like you.
And I'm not one of you.

585
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,042
Are you sure?

586
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,120
I'm really gonna have to
ask you to leave now.

587
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,918
One last round, darling.

588
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:30,891
Sorry, it's already way past closing.
I'll get in trouble.

589
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,586
I'll never ask
for anything again.

590
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,095
Girl Scout's honor.

591
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:39,056
Can you spare
a cigarette?

592
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,131
How many of you are there?

593
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:51,236
Not as many as there used to be,
that's for sure.

594
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,611
Nature's way, perhaps.

595
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,942
If so, nature's pretty
damned unmerciful.

596
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,783
Are you merciful?

597
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,948
I draw the line, sure...

598
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,983
no children, no babies...

599
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:09,053
not like Harrison.

600
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,292
- And you?
- What about me?

601
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,097
Well, you must have gone through some
pretty gruesome self-discoveries.

602
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,195
You must have found
shelter somewhere...

603
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,668
a weapon maker.

604
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,870
Something like that.

605
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:27,143
So how is Arturo?

606
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,315
He's one of you.

607
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:34,412
Not just one of us.
He... he ran everything

608
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,889
till Bishop got sick of it.

609
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,427
He really didn't tell you
any of this?

610
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,392
He's always been wise.

611
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,664
You never would have started this
if you knew you were just his pawn.

612
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,705
His pawn for what?

613
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,036
To get rid of Bishop.

614
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,809
Five minutes, guys.

615
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,674
It's full moon tonight.

616
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,980
The best moon of the year
to be with the one you love.

617
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,555
If that's a confession...

618
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,529
you picked the wrong time.

619
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,565
It's a declaration.

620
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,662
We all have our purpose.

621
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,508
I simply forgot what mine was
a long time ago.

622
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:07,079
I prayed you would come,
Sadie Blake.

623
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,315
If that's what you want.

624
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,984
I can't have what I want.

625
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,291
So do what you
came here to do.

626
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,422
And good luck to you.

627
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,387
Hello?

628
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,121
Fuck!

629
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,158
How'd she do that?

630
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,699
I have a gun!

631
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,533
I don't want
to hurt you.

632
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,259
Oh shit.

633
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:01,779
I can't move.
I think you broke my leg.

634
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,052
Sure looks like it.

635
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:07,562
Holy shit,
you fucking maniac, you!

636
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:08,994
I had a bag...
where is it?

637
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:13,558
What bag,
you crazy bit... ahh!

638
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:15,967
Don't change
the subject again.

639
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,267
Do we understand
each other?

640
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,405
My bag, where it is?

641
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,034
Dwayne took it.

642
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,238
- He took your car.
- Where?

643
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:28,407
It's a place called The Crest.
It's about 20 miles from here.

644
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:31,418
It's a deserted compound
with a bunch of stables in it.

645
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,977
- That's where Bishop is?
- I guess.

646
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,886
Look, you've gotta
believe me.

647
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,891
I don't know jack
about any of this, okay?

648
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,928
Bishop just told me
to bring you to him.

649
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:44,591
- He said my name? He knows who I am?
- No no.

650
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,634
I was instructed to go
to the bar

651
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:49,101
and bring in anyone
who came in asking for him.

652
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,762
Do you know
what Bishop is?

653
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:52,830
I heard he's the leader
of this cult

654
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,967
and they have
these crazy house orgies,

655
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:56,908
but I didn't believe
any of the shit

656
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,912
about them feeding on people.
I just...

657
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,279
I thought I'd hook up with some Goth
chicks who are into threesomes.

658
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,012
What is it with you geeky guys and these
Goth chicks anyway?

659
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,146
Please, please,
please don't kill me.

660
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,656
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

661
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:13,125
I'm so sorry.
I'm so goddamn sorry!

662
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,425
I've never done a bad thing in my life.
I beg you.

663
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,659
When is this party
supposed to be?

664
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,667
Tomorrow at midnight.

665
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,226
These kids that I heard it from
are serious about...

666
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,431
hey, wait!

667
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,701
Wait, hey!

668
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,834
How am I supposed to...

669
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,420
Dear Jesus,

670
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,221
my Savior,

671
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,285
I know
I've neglected you

672
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,854
so bad for so long,

673
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:53,867
but if you could
help me out of this...

674
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,745
Sadie...

675
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,132
I feel the same way
about you.

676
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,366
- Yes.
- Hello, is this Eve?

677
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,768
Yes.

678
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:47,103
You told me to call
if I saw that guy again,

679
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:50,633
- The one we talked about earlier.
- Sure.

680
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,408
Well, he just walked
into the bar.

681
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,913
- Where is he?
- Eve?

682
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:42,388
- What do you want?
- I want to ask you a few questions.

683
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,866
I'm not in a chatty mood,
Officer.

684
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,665
That obvious, huh?

685
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,947
I think this belongs to you.

686
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,046
Where did you find that?

687
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:11,819
A redneck named
Dwayne Musgrove

688
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,760
borrowed your car
a little earlier tonight.

689
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:18,390
The kid can steal cars
but he sure as hell can't drive 'em.

690
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:23,500
- I know you.
- Do you?

691
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,471
Yeah,

692
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,839
I never forget a face.

693
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,275
Occupational hazard.

694
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:33,007
What occupation
would that be?

695
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,612
I'm gonna grab that bag
and walk out of here.

696
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:40,483
I won't hurt you
if you don't try to stop me.

697
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,417
That's one hell of an if.

698
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:47,325
That's up to you.

699
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:53,660
- Just a few more questions.
- Maybe some other time.

700
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,608
Here I thought bartenders
were supposed to be like priests.

701
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:05,845
I'm sorry.

702
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,692
Drop the bag.
Put your hands on the bar. Do it.

703
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,526
- You're under arrest.
- I don't have time for this.

704
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,623
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I need my gear!

705
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,793
I suggest you use
that goddamn right.

706
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,360
Listen to me.
You don't understand!

707
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:33,134
Oh, sure I do.
Everybody's innocent.

708
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,005
Not me.
Not by a mile.

709
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,909
Did you kill her?

710
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,076
- Was it you?
- Who?

711
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,086
My daughter.

712
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,281
I know you were there.

713
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:50,916
- Did you touch her?
- Hey, man, take it easy.

714
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,187
Back the fuck off!

715
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:00,591
Don't you move.

716
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,071
Go. Go!

717
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:13,642
I'm not who you
think I am.

718
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,876
Really?
You're not a killer?

719
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:45,537
Tricia's the reason
I'm in this mess to begin with,

720
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:47,740
but I didn't kill her.
I'm after the man who did.

721
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:54,185
- Why?
- Because he did the same thing to me.

722
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:56,052
What are you
talking about?

723
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:01,022
These people are...
are not...

724
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,529
I'm not one of them.
I'm trying to get rid of them.

725
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:05,930
And he's the only one left.
His name is Bishop.

726
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,096
I'm gonna kill him.

727
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:16,542
And the moment that happens
I'm... I'm done.

728
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,238
I'm not a person anymore.

729
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:22,080
I'll tell you what:

730
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,742
backup's on the way.

731
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,581
You tell them exactly
what you just told me

732
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:27,644
and we'll see what kind
of deal they cut you.

733
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:28,848
Look at me.

734
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,017
In the mirror.

735
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:47,469
You really
don't remember me?

736
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:52,104
Because I remember you.

737
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,410
My name is Sadie Blake.

738
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,746
I...

739
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,181
I was a reporter.

740
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:09,161
That's...
that's impossible.

741
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:12,165
I zipped you
into a body bag.

742
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:15,327
You can come with me
if you like.

743
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,963
I'll kill your daughter's
killer for you.

744
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,973
And you can return the favor
by killing me.

745
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,633
I can't do that.

746
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,269
Your daughter was raped,
gutted,

747
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:26,677
and left in a dumpster,
but you can't do that?!

748
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,450
All right...

749
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:07,081
let's say I believe you.

750
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:11,783
I still can't help you.

751
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:17,597
Then this whole conversation's
a waste of time I don't have.

752
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:19,929
Sorry.

753
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,094
Keys to the cuffs.

754
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:23,932
Slow.

755
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:25,768
If you even think about
going for your piece,

756
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,967
I will snap your neck.

757
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:36,947
Now the bag.

758
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:38,986
Slow.

759
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:49,129
Okay, now the tricky part.

760
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,563
Your gun...

761
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:55,500
toss it out the window.

762
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,936
Please don't give me
a reason.

763
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:11,274
I'm gonna release you now,
nice and easy.

764
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:15,914
It takes me 4.3 seconds
to load that crossbow. I've timed it.

765
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,515
You keep that in mind
when you make a run for your life.

766
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,413
Let's try this again.
You're under arrest.

767
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:46,351
I will fire
if you don't stop!

768
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,122
Last warning.

769
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:12,837
That fucking hurt.

770
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:16,475
All right,

771
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,381
Number one's right there
beneath the surface.

772
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,420
I can just barely
make it out.

773
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,422
I'm going to douse the wound
with alcohol.

774
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,117
How many times
have you done this?

775
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,591
You don't wanna know.

776
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,562
Ooh!

777
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:33,124
Tell me about
your condition.

778
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,828
I'm in pain, I'm exhausted,
I'm angry.

779
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:38,895
I didn't mean currently.
I meant since...

780
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,635
it happened to you.

781
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:43,643
What's it like?

782
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:46,441
Pain, exhaustion, anger.
That's what it's like.

783
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,010
Is it genetic?

784
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:52,518
I haven't exactly
volunteered for tests.

785
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:55,384
- What about food?
- What about it?

786
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,651
You can't keep down
regular food?

787
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,888
You have a skillful way
of putting a girl at ease, Rawlins.

788
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:03,020
Try asking me anything else.

789
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,758
How many guys have
you slept with?

790
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,766
Since my, uh...

791
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,428
what did you call it,
condition?

792
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:13,366
- None, I guess.
- You guess?

793
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,841
I was taught to never
play with my food.

794
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:17,741
Number one.

795
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,615
I do apologize.

796
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:26,253
Hey, you needed proof, right?

797
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,551
I meant I apologize
for what comes next.

798
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:32,183
That was the easy one.
This one's really gonna hurt.

799
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:34,888
No shame in passing out.

800
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:48,536
Water.

801
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:56,248
Do you mind brushing the hair
out of my eyes?

802
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:18,769
What time is it?

803
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:20,773
Late afternoon.

804
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:23,309
You must have been tired.

805
01:36:26,647 --> 01:36:29,013
Aren't we past all this?
I have to use the bathroom.

806
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:35,545
You're still
a serial killer.

807
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:40,420
And I do hate surprises.

808
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,764
All right, stand up
and turn around.

809
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:46,356
Come on,
what am I gonna do?

810
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,128
You're gonna turn around,
that's what.

811
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:53,469
Can you at least
cuff me in the front?

812
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:55,532
It's kind of hard to wipe
with your hands behind your back.

813
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,557
The door stays open.

814
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:16,653
No arguing.

815
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:19,221
Cheap thrills.

816
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:28,799
Were you and Tricia
very close?

817
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:31,572
Not so much over
the last few years.

818
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,845
Let me guess:
your marriage, your job,

819
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,849
you neglected
your wife and kid,

820
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:38,248
took them for granted.

821
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,048
If you're aiming
for "perceptive,"

822
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,112
it's coming off
painfully smug.

823
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,988
- Sorry, what I meant was...
- I know what you meant.

824
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,688
Doesn't mean
I don't regret it.

825
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,329
You need help
with that?

826
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:57,660
In my whole life,
you're the first guy

827
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,536
who's ever offered
to put my pants back on.

828
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:05,101
I'm not here
to flirt with you.

829
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:09,944
Oh, I forgot how awkward conversations
get between men and women.

830
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:16,715
Would you? I can't
twist my wrists properly.

831
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,610
Thank you.

832
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:44,415
The condition is genetic.

833
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:48,046
I mean, I'm no doctor, but I've never
seen tissue regenerate like that.

834
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:50,283
- It's incredible.
- Are we getting personal now?

835
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:53,292
Well, I did just zip up
your jeans.

836
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,295
You're funny.

837
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:58,490
Don't assume you know me.

838
01:38:58,565 --> 01:39:00,556
You don't know me.

839
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:04,202
I know that you drink
a little too much.

840
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:06,933
I know what you've eaten
in the last 48 hours.

841
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:09,840
And I know that I'm
turning you on right now.

842
01:39:11,245 --> 01:39:13,236
You have a vivid imagination.

843
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,578
Overdeveloped
sense of smell, actually.

844
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,173
Are we gonna do this,
yes or no?

845
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:18,775
Long as you remember
our deal.

846
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,581
I kill Bishop,
you kill me.

847
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:23,214
I remember.
Now let's go.

848
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,451
We have to wait
till sundown.

849
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:30,191
You are aware
that there are a dozen cops

850
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:33,028
canvassing the area
looking for two sore thumbs?

851
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:36,001
We still have to wait
till sundown.

852
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,617
All right.

853
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:53,050
Tell me everything you know
about this cult,

854
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,145
from the beginning.

855
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:16,009
Not much of a party.

856
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:27,418
Look,
we stick together...

857
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:29,752
no matter what.

858
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:32,758
Then what's
with the radio?

859
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:35,556
That's in case
you forget.

860
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:38,120
I need you to mail this
for me once we're done.

861
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,338
- Your mother?
- I never got to say goodbye.

862
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,288
Rawlins.

863
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:17,092
Jesus fucking Christ.

864
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:19,935
You know him?

865
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:21,907
That's the kid
who stole your car.

866
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:25,342
He hasn't been dead long.
That blood is still fresh.

867
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:39,079
Tricia?

868
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,883
Tricia!
Oh my God!

869
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,754
Daddy!
Oh! Oh God!

870
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,759
Oh God!

871
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:55,491
It's horrible.
They're all dead.

872
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:57,730
- They're all dead.
- I'm here with you now.

873
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:00,898
I will never let anything
happen to you again.

874
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:03,101
Get... get 'em off
before he comes back.

875
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,906
- Hurry!
- Sadie!

876
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,513
- Rawlins...
- Come and help me, quick!

877
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:17,079
- Rawlins, get up.
- What's the matter?

878
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:20,759
Get up.

879
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,628
- What's the matter with you?
- She's one of them.

880
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:28,259
You saw her body
in that dumpster.

881
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:31,065
- No.
- Bishop turned her. Think it through.

882
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,106
Put the gun down!

883
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:35,768
Sweetheart?

884
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:39,243
I'm not your sweetheart.
You make me sick.

885
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:41,372
I hate everything
you stand for.

886
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:43,541
But you no longer
have power over me.

887
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:45,881
I'm free now.

888
01:43:45,953 --> 01:43:49,411
That's not you talking.
They've done this to you.

889
01:43:49,489 --> 01:43:51,889
Bishop predicted you
would act just like this...

890
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:54,826
blame it all
on brainwashing

891
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:58,558
because you can't fathom the idea I can
make up my own mind.

892
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:02,124
- No.
- I finally have a place where I belong.

893
01:44:02,202 --> 01:44:04,602
Tricia...

894
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:08,038
I'm your father
and I love you.

895
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:11,600
Bishop is my father

896
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:15,136
and my brother
and my lover.

897
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:18,616
It would blow your mind,
the things he makes me do.

898
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:23,252
He makes me whole.
And you?

899
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:27,419
You're nothing
to me. Nothing.

900
01:44:27,494 --> 01:44:29,325
Put the gun down now!

901
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:31,660
And I won't
let you destroy

902
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:34,963
the one good thing
in my life.

903
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:37,868
Bye, Daddy.

904
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,633
No!

905
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:04,219
It's not you
I'm after!

906
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,316
Fuck off!

907
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,828
Suits me.

908
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:24,574
Why are you
helping him?

909
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:26,407
He wants to
get rid of us.

910
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,380
He doesn't understand
anything.

911
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:30,211
You've got five seconds
to tell me where Bishop is.

912
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,648
Five...

913
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,447
- Four...
- Never!

914
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:37,756
One.

915
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:40,349
Just when you think life won't ever
surprise you again.

916
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:48,998
18 next week...

917
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:52,197
never been to New York.

918
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:54,638
I promised I'd take her.

919
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:56,141
Change of plans.

920
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:59,042
Her father's behavior
I can understand,

921
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:01,979
but why are you doing this?

922
01:47:02,048 --> 01:47:05,484
- You're one of us.
- Not by choice.

923
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:07,918
Choice, what is that?

924
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:09,717
Who has a choice
in anything?

925
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,191
You had a choice in raping me
and leaving me for dead!

926
01:47:15,128 --> 01:47:16,720
You're being childish.

927
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:19,698
There's an order to things.
Everything happens for a reason.

928
01:47:55,769 --> 01:48:00,536
Maybe revenge is just a story that
you're telling yourself.

929
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:04,304
Maybe it's just an excuse

930
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:06,675
to become what you
really are.

931
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:10,483
I'm not like you.

932
01:48:12,185 --> 01:48:14,210
I see.

933
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:17,745
Don't you think we were all
scared and confused at first?

934
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:20,190
I'm not like you.

935
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,627
You keep saying it
to yourself enough times,

936
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:25,722
maybe you'll
convince yourself.

937
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:31,235
You're insane.

938
01:48:31,304 --> 01:48:34,671
My definition of insane

939
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:38,677
is a person who sees
a gift as a curse.

940
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:42,442
Personally, I think you have
to play the cards you're dealt.

941
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:47,283
And here's where that word
you like so much... choice... comes in.

942
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:51,990
I choose to experience

943
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:55,687
everything
the world has to offer

944
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:58,424
in exchange for a few
meaningless lives.

945
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:03,567
These closet pedophiles
and spoiled teenagers

946
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:06,470
aren't going to be missed
by anyone, Sadie.

947
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,906
So the choice

948
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,636
is all yours:

949
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:15,037
Sadie Blake

950
01:49:15,115 --> 01:49:19,245
or the dregs of society?
Be honest.

951
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:24,982
Because you're damned
if you do,

952
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:28,050
and you're damned
if you don't.

953
01:49:28,128 --> 01:49:31,427
I'd rather be
damned if I don't.

954
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:40,231
So be it.

955
01:49:44,678 --> 01:49:48,876
You know,
Eve was wrong about you.

956
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:52,407
You were never anything more
than a beautiful sacrifice.

957
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,645
Don't do this.
Don't.

958
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:58,190
In which case,

959
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:00,726
you came a very long way

960
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,694
to die again.

961
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,730
Don't do it, please!

962
01:50:47,073 --> 01:50:49,735
Am I dead?

963
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:51,777
I don't know
how to answer that.

964
01:50:56,883 --> 01:51:00,080
But you're dead.
I saw you.

965
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:03,213
I was wearing a Kevlar vest.
Now shut up.

966
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:39,658
I don't believe you.
How did you find me?

967
01:51:42,062 --> 01:51:44,428
I was tracking you.

968
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,426
I'm sorry
about your daughter.

969
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:55,970
Can you walk?

970
01:52:01,214 --> 01:52:04,183
This is going to hurt.

971
01:52:09,856 --> 01:52:12,381
What do you think
you're doing?

972
01:52:12,459 --> 01:52:14,427
It's a tourniquet.

973
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:17,622
It'll stop the bleeding.
You need it.

974
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:21,297
I called for backup.

975
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:23,733
Help's on the way.

976
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:25,828
I didn't come this far
to just walk away.

977
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,770
You can't even fucking
walk, Sadie.

978
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,672
That's my point.

979
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:31,973
I'm not leaving here
until I kill him.

980
01:52:32,045 --> 01:52:34,172
You don't have
your crossbow.

981
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:37,273
- Details.
- Jesus!

982
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:05,603
- Stay with me.
- Frankly, I'm disappointed, Rawlins.

983
01:53:07,914 --> 01:53:09,848
Up!

984
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:11,508
Are you really
going to save her?

985
01:53:11,584 --> 01:53:14,144
She murdered your daughter
in cold blood.

986
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:21,851
The very definition of ironic,
I would think.

987
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:30,600
And yet just like a cop,

988
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:33,833
always trying to save
their own people.

989
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:35,534
Shut up.

990
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:39,775
Get up, Sadie.

991
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:44,710
Get up.

992
01:53:53,226 --> 01:53:55,524
It's only fair you know
the truth about your daughter.

993
01:53:55,595 --> 01:53:57,654
At first she seemed
just like the rest,

994
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:00,494
average and dull...
your typical confused teenager.

995
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:02,228
But the more
I got to know her,

996
01:54:02,302 --> 01:54:05,169
and I mean really know her
inside out,

997
01:54:05,238 --> 01:54:07,468
the more of a revelation
she became.

998
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:14,510
Oh, she blossomed into
one depraved little girl.

999
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:17,612
You should know that.

1000
01:54:21,754 --> 01:54:24,018
Let him go.

1001
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,558
The Alchemist
was right about you.

1002
01:54:26,626 --> 01:54:29,151
You'll never
be a true leader.

1003
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:31,857
You don't pay attention
to the details.

1004
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:36,933
Now!

1005
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:52,417
I'm sorry
about your daughter.

1006
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:57,689
I really am.

1007
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:02,322
She was dead already.

1008
01:55:09,402 --> 01:55:11,927
So am I.

1009
01:55:13,306 --> 01:55:16,434
Come on,
finish this.

1010
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:23,539
Don't think.

1011
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:28,414
- Just do it.
- Sadie...

1012
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:30,581
You owe me this.

1013
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:34,184
I can't live unless I kill
and I can't live that way.

1014
01:55:36,729 --> 01:55:38,788
Do it.

1015
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,965
Please.

1016
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:06,152
Let's move.
Wait for command.

1017
01:56:06,225 --> 01:56:08,819
Secure the rear!

1018
01:56:08,895 --> 01:56:11,261
Cover both sides.
Let's go!

1019
01:56:19,772 --> 01:56:22,297
Please.

1020
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:24,309
- All right, move!
- Let's go!

1021
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:27,139
Go go go!
