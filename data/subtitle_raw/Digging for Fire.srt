1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,420
<i> Is this our new house?</i>

2
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,324
<i> No, this isn't our new house,</i>
  <i> bud, this belongs to one</i>
  <i> of Mommy's yoga clients.</i>

3
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,259
<i> Yeah, we couldn't</i>
    <i> afford this house,</i>

4
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,361
<i> -but we're happy</i>
  <i> to stay here.</i>
  -<i> Tim... Tim...</i>

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,829
<i> This is like a nice</i>
     <i> hotel house.</i>

6
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,199
- <i> Are you gonna be</i>  <i> a D-O-U-C-H-E?
- </i>  -<i> No, no, no.</i>

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,868
<i> Okay, good.</i>

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,004
     <i> It's gonna be a really</i>
     <i> super fun vacation</i>
     <i> for our family.</i>

9
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,873
- <i> Oh!</i>
-    -<i> Yeah!</i>

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,274
- <i> Are you excited?</i>
-  -<i> Yeah.</i>

11
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,576
All right, Jude,
     it's time.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,346
             He's going first,
             for sure.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,417
Okay, thank you.

14
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,587
- All right.

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,057
Guys, swimming pool.

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,463
       -Good, right?
       -Yeah, it's great.

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,034
       -I'm really glad
       we're doing this.
       -Me too.

18
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,702
             -Yeah?
             -Yeah.

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,806
      -It's gonna be fun.
      -We'll build a fire.

20
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,140
   What do you think, buddy?

21
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,475
Good.

22
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,480
            -Fun.
            -Yeah.

23
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,320
...for me now, okay? Perfect.

24
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:32,491
  Oh, yeah.
  That's called Child's Pose.
  You can put your head
  down right there.

25
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,662
  That's a resting pose. Yeah.

26
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:40,499
  It's like a really, really
  sweet resting pose.

27
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,771
     Okay, and then you're gonna
     come up on your hands.

28
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,907
      Up. Stay there.
      Now we're gonna pretend...

29
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,544
    We're gonna come up
    a little bit,
    come up where you just were.

30
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,448
           Right here.
           Okay, now we're gonna
           pretend we're a cow.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,217
   -We're gonna go like this.
   -Okay.

32
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,985
       -We go like this.
       -A cow.

33
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,154
         A cow. And we're gonna
         kind of arch our...

34
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,856
             Yeah, that's
             perfect, buddy.

35
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,658
And then we're gonna pretend
 we're a cat and go like this.

36
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,144
         Left leg,
         which is your left leg?

37
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,479
       This one.

38
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,349
      This one?
      This one's your right leg.
      This one's your left leg.

39
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,152
         Okay, you're gonna fold
         this one in right here,

40
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:36,822
         and now you're gonna
         bend over your left leg
         and touch your toes
         with your fingers.

41
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,024
            Can you do that one?

42
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,601
<i> You're gonna straighten</i>
        <i> your legs,</i>

43
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,338
    and you're gonna touch
    your toes like this.
    Can you do it like that?

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
           Yeah.

45
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,876
- Wow, you sure can,
  and then you're gonna fold
  your head right over there.

46
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,611
        God bless you,
        God bless you.

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,781
Gesundheit.

48
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,617
  We're gonna go like this,
  and you're gonna put
  your head down for a second,
  like, down here.

49
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,153
- <i> How does that feel?</i>
-  -<i> Good.</i>

50
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,989
<i> It feels good?
</i>  <i> Do you feel like</i>  <i> a nice stretch in here?</i>

51
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,246
Here,
     you want some of this?

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,191
Hey, Lee,
look what I found
on the hill.

53
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,761
      So I was just
      digging around here,
      I wanted to see
      where that sprinkler went,

54
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,363
               and I started
               kicking around
               and I found this.

55
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,798
        -Can I touch it?
        -Yes.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
    And then this bone, Lee,
    was, like, back in the hill.

57
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,502
      That's a bone?
      Let me see that.
      I wanna touch that.

58
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,704
           I feel like we gotta
           know whatever--

59
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,173
    I mean, are you trying
    to think like "pow pow"?

60
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,808
- Mom?
-           -Yes.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,946
    I think at some point,
    somebody put this...
    And if we go deep in here...

62
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,514
      Oh, God. No, no, no.

63
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,451
       And I feel like we should
       probably find out
       what it is.

64
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,552
              Why?

65
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,061
  See, now you know
  what happens to my brain,
  because now my brain thinks
  there's like 20 bodies...

66
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,097
                 There could be.

67
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,033
- There absolutely      could be.
-       -It's my skin.

68
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,436
All right. Okay.

69
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,675
Great. So if I find it myself
then I'll call, for sure.

70
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,811
It's ridiculous.
Absolutely.

71
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,382
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, goodbye. Thank you.

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,286
That was a joke.

73
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:52,190
Uh, the L.A.P.D. just said
that it's not their job to
dig out somebody else's trash,

74
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,626
and to call
if we find the body,

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,495
but in the meantime,
there's nothing
they could do.

76
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,830
And she had a tone with me,
like I was doing
something wrong.

77
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,833
                    Good.

78
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,037
And I told her
about the gun
and I told her
about the bone, so...

79
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,571
               So, what are you
               gonna do?

80
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,407
I'm gonna dig out
the body.

81
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,176
    -Or I'm gonna at least
    get closer to that.
    -No, I think
    we're gonna leave it.

82
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,011
Lee, we can't leave it.

83
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,214
             Tim, I was just
             putting down Jude
             and he was like,
             "Where's the bone?"

84
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,883
Fine, we don't tell Jude.
I'm fine with that.

85
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,485
I told Jude,
and he said, "What was it?"
And I said it was just pretend.

86
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,188
    -It was probably a bone
    from a coyote.
    -So let's find out
    if it's pretend.

87
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,456
                     Why?

88
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,458
'Cause there might be
a dead body on our hill.

89
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,093
             It's not our hill.

90
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,395
Fine, of the hill
of this person.

91
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:34,199
       Of my client,
       of my livelihood, my job,

92
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,002
 And I can't have them come home
 after shooting a movie
 in Budapest and say,

93
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,870
       "Oh, guess what.
       And by the way,
       while you're out of town,

94
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,140
   "my husband decided to, like,
   excavate your hillside,

95
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,777
"and we found remains of a body,
and we think it's conn..."

96
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,547
           I mean, what?
           Connected to what?
           Where is it gonna go?

97
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,516
Well, obviously, I don't know
the end of the mystery
at the beginning of the mystery.

98
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,585
    Right, if there's a mystery.

99
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:58,357
   I mean, my guess is that
   it's an animal bone
   and it just happened to be...

100
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,059
  -Some other animal shot it?
  -Yeah.

101
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,729
    -Come on, Lee. Come on.
    -You come on.

102
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,631
    Let's not make this
    a crazy drama.
    Let's just enjoy this place.

103
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,300
Okay.

104
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,302
        -That was just
        way too easy.
        -I was thinking.

105
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,003
           No, you said, "Okay."

106
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,639
     And then I did
     see you think like, "Okay,
     I'm gonna appease my wife

107
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,609
     -"and then I'm gonna
     keep digging."
     -No. I won't dig.

108
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,478
       -No more digging?
       -No more digging.

109
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,615
Let's go enjoy this place.

110
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,721
And if you want
a little bit more of a stretch,

111
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,491
you could push
your foot up to the ceiling.

112
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,861
Nice.

113
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,700
Tell me
if this is too much.

114
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,336
Ready? Ooh-hoo!

115
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,104
All right, good.
We made up a new game.

116
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,172
            -Oh!
            -Great!

117
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,042
     You're gonna arch
     your back and look up.

118
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,046
        Then we're gonna
        round our backs

119
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,150
 and kind of, like, tighten
 right in here, right in here.

120
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:03,088
No, don't get me!
Don't get me, buddy!
Don't get me!

121
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,325
What? Aah! Full wipe-out!

122
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,661
<i> It's cheesy to say,</i>
       <i> but really,</i>

123
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:14,065
 and people say this
 all the time,
 but they really were, like,
 glowing when they came back,

124
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,734
      -and they seemed...
      -Yeah.

125
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,804
   Maybe this is just
   how I feel about Ken,
   but he seemed a lot nicer.

126
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,172
             -Yeah.
             -Okay.

127
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,607
You know, like, they really...
It's something that it's like...

128
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,044
- I think you owe it to yourself to do it, you know?
-  -Mmm.

129
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,546
        Yeah, I mean, honestly--

130
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,048
I mean,
I've always wanted
to go to India, like...

131
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,384
   -literally forever.
   -So do it, fucking do it.

132
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,287
You know,
once you have kids,
it's like you can't,
I just can't...

133
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,824
            That kid came
            into your life,
            it wasn't the other
            way around.

134
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,393
        He came in to your home.
        Take your kid
        with you, you know?

135
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,195
       Don't let that limit you,
       you know?

136
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,329
              Ugh, yeah.

137
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,097
      -No, it's not--
      -When we have kids,

138
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,366
        we're not, you know,
        it's not gonna limit us.

139
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,502
- No.
-          -Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,404
What time was it
when you looked at your phone?

141
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,407
              It was uh... 5:30.

142
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,809
I have to get home
and make the sweet pea dinner.

143
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,077
             -Oh.
             -Yeah.

144
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,712
Have a fantastic time.

145
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,615
             -Thank you so much
             for this beautiful
             session today.
             -You guys practice.

146
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,711
You don't have
regular milk, do you?

147
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,046
           Um, we have raw milk.

148
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,783
Do you have
regular milk, though?

149
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:45,924
Um, today we have goat's milk,
uh, coconut milk, almond milk,
cashew milk, um, soy milk,

150
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,594
       and then there's hemp
       and flax milk actually
       in the dry goods section.

151
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,630
So no
just regular milk?

152
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,131
                      Not today.

153
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:58,637
  I can't believe the poopies
  go in the ground.

154
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,872
  -That's where dogs and cats
  go poopie, in the ground.
  -Jude, Jude, Jude...

155
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,876
      Let's have dinner.
      It's not nice to talk
      about poopies
      at the dinner table, okay?

156
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,211
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

157
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,979
        -But guess what.
        -But I love you.

158
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,515
  -And your daddy needs to do
  the taxes this weekend...
  -Yeah.

159
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,753
   ...because I'm gonna have
   a nervous breakdown
   if I eat dinner on this table
   like this one more time.

160
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,622
You got it. Hey, Jude,
can I ask you a question
about the taxes?

161
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,558
Uh, did you take
a poopie today?

162
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,860
           I didn't.

163
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,894
   What?

164
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,530
     -Tim, I'm not joking.
     -Okay, yeah.

165
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,667
         We love you so much.
         You're such a good boy.

166
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,037
          -Aw.
          -All right.

167
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,239
- See? You make me
       the bad guy.
       -How do I...

168
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,907
               Because you have
               to do this.

169
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,109
    -And them I'm getting...
    I'm turning into this.
    -Okay, how about this?

170
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,680
You can go play.
You can do whatever
you want, buddy boy.
Is that okay?

171
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,716
 -I'll do the taxes. I'm sorry.
 -No, but see?
 You see what happens?

172
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,619
       And then I'm...
       And then I'm the bad guy.

173
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,689
       Come here.
       Come here.

174
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,058
      -Just do it.
      This weekend. I know.
      -Okay.

175
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,196
<i> I don't wanna take</i>

176
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,166
your mom and
your step-dad's money
in this moment.

177
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,403
And I don't think
there's anything wrong with that
'cause we're talking about
a three-year-old boy.

178
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,738
               Mm-hmm.

179
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,274
If this conversation
was about college
and it was...

180
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,509
 -college or no college, then--
 -They say, they say...

181
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:17,215
        They say, they say that
        preschool now
        is more important in
        getting into college

182
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,950
   -than, like, high school.
   -Stop it. I don't--

183
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,152
   -It is!
   They say development is--
   -Who the fuck is "they"?

184
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,423
      The experts, whatever.
      All the stuff that I read.

185
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:31,930
Yeah, and then
we read another thing
about preschools where, uh,
the one that was all dirt

186
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,865
and they play in the dirt
all the time

187
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,201
  -and they raise
  those turtles.
  -Yeah, I read that article.

188
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:41,506
And you spend $12,000
for three months
and you need to pay
for every extra activity.

189
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,008
And there's...

190
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,510
    Yeah, but, here's the thing,
    you wouldn't be
    paying for it.

191
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,879
         That's the thing.
         That's the thing
         that I'm talking about.

192
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,882
How about our son
goes to school
in the neighborhood
he lives in?

193
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,019
     Yeah, how about
     that school is a six?

194
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,689
              How about
              he's in preschool?

195
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,824
It's not a good preschool.

196
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,794
Let them run around
and figure out problems
on their own.

197
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,663
And so if one kid
bites another kid,

198
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,999
   -well then, the biter
   hangs out with the bitee...
   -Oh, stop. Stop.

199
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,604
...and they have to figure out
what they did wrong,
and they talk it out
for $10,000 over three months.

200
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:16,174
           You're making me mad.
           I'm reading this.
           You're making me mad.

201
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,310
      -Do you want some of this?
      -No.

202
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,180
      -"Love and Foreplay
      Aren't Blind."
      -Yeah, right.

203
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,748
My favorite chapter.

204
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,351
   What does that even mean?

205
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,275
    Hi, Mom, it's me.
    Can you give me a call
    when you get this?

206
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:55,246
       I, uh, was thinking
       about coming down
       for the weekend
       with Jude.

207
00:11:55,248 --> 00:12:00,452
    And maybe asking
    if you'd babysit for me
    so I can have
    a night out to myself.

208
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:04,589
  I just...
  Tim's got a lot to of stuff
  to do this weekend

209
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,459
    and I just need a break
    to be honest with you.

210
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,461
       I love you.
       Call me back. Bye.

211
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,614
You're on the hook
for next time.

212
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,816
                 Okay. Have fun.

213
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,085
   -Don't have too much fun.
   -I won't.

214
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,720
                   Okay, say hi
                   to everybody.

215
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,988
      Yes, I will.

216
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,957
       -Love you guys.
       -We love you, Daddy.

217
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,992
- Bye.
-           -Bye.

218
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,995
Okay, bud,
     you're ready to go see
     Grandma and Pop-pop?

219
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,096
Yeah.

220
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,865
Don't forget the taxes.

221
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,500
Don't forget the taxes.

222
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,802
                 I won't.

223
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,772
    Why don't I come to you?
    Because I haven't seen
    the kids in so long.

224
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:58,176
     That would be so nice,
     and then we'll just
     do it from there.

225
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,811
             Cool?

226
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:03,848
  All right, get ready, baby.
  We are gonna have a fun
  Saturday night.

227
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,590
- Mama?
-          -Yeah?

228
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,659
Why isn't Daddy here?

229
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:20,165
Because Daddy had to
  stay home and do some things
  that Mommy wanted him to do.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,768
Because Daddy
has some responsibilities.

231
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,672
     Oh, what is
     a responsibility?

232
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,441
   -What's a responsibility?
   -Yeah.

233
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:35,780
 Sometimes mommies want daddies
 to pitch in and help out
 and do things,

234
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,448
      and those are called
      responsibilities.

235
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,719
   And if you don't do them,
   then Mommy comes after you

236
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:47,125
  and goes, "Rawr!
  Why didn't you do everything
  I wanted you to do?"

237
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,260
   -You don't like
   when Mommy gets like that.
   -No.

238
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,229
      No. I don't like it
      either, actually.

239
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,365
      So Daddy is at home
      doing his homework.

240
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,968
          -Right?
          -Yeah.

241
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,145
             Yeah!

242
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,722
- Hey, man.
-         -Hey, man.

243
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,056
- How are you?
-           -Good.

244
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,491
Can you believe it?

245
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,227
     This is very strange.

246
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,163
 Very unusual for people like me
 to be at a place like this.

247
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,432
  -It's the best, right?
  -Yeah. Thanks for having me.

248
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,067
Yeah, you got it.

249
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,236
I'm just griling out, man.
Check it out.

250
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,572
Explore the place.
This is all ours tonight.

251
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,540
There's a pool,
there's a hill.

252
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,909
                Yeah?

253
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,246
I think I am gonna walk around.
This whole place is hers?

254
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,915
                     Everything.

255
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,316
Hey, would you grab
some buns?

256
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,619
                     Yeah, yeah.

257
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,590
       I'm gonna pee
       in each of the bathrooms,
       is that okay?

258
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,793
<i> So then the lesson is,</i>
  <i> "Hopefully you get</i>
  <i> a really lucky,</i>

259
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:32,063
and your grandmother
marries a man
who's got a lot of money,

260
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,198
and then therefore
you get to go
to private school,

261
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,234
but your parents
couldn't have
sent you there."

262
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,669
                   Yeah.

263
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,805
And so then you're
essentially alienated
from your own surroundings.

264
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,974
                   Right.

265
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,810
               Yeah, I mean,
               there's pros
               and cons to both.

266
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,681
   I think the optimistic choice
   is sending them
   to public school

267
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,949
               because we teach
               at public school.

268
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,650
     That's right.
     That's right.

269
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,452
     If we don't believe
     that you can send
     your kids to public school.

270
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,587
 -Then what am I doing?
 -That's right. What are we...

271
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,855
        Yeah, what are we doing?

272
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,791
       Yeah, what is
       that lesson then?

273
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,460
     I teach there,
     but my kid doesn't go.

274
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,095
         -Very cynical.
         -Yes.

275
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,997
               I'm very cynical.

276
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,399
     Mind you, I teach gym.

277
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,337
We would start
constructing the fire
when there was still light.

278
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,072
      -That's right.
      -So we, you know,

279
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,174
we could do it right,
the tepee.

280
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,709
           No, I'm good, thanks.

281
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,243
       Here you go, Paul.

282
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,012
              When we told her,
              you know...

283
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,047
  So we were
  with the cat and it's like,
  "We don't believe in anything.

284
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,882
    We don't believe
    you're going to cat heaven."

285
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,686
        So it's like
        we're just telling her,
        like, "We appreciate
        that you were alive.

286
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,190
- Oh, jeez.
  -Like it's just so...
  It's devastating.

287
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,760
You know what, though,
having someone come over
and put the cat
out of its misery,

288
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,696
way better
than taking an animal in.

289
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,266
'Cause the last thing
they'll remember is all this
panic and fear in the car.

290
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,002
- You shouldn't      take them in.
      -No.

291
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,738
I think you have
        to put them down
        at the house.

292
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,741
       I think it's funny
       'cause it's just like...

293
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:55,346
         Cremation versus burial
         is such a no-brainer
         when I think about it.

294
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,882
  It's like crem...
  Everyone should be cremated.

295
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,450
Why is it
a no-brainer?

296
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,219
        Because there's too many
        people on the earth,
        there's no space.

297
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,588
    -Oh, you mean practically?
    -Yeah.

298
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,526
So no one got it.
       All right.

299
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,194
           150!

300
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,800
      That was
      a nice toss, though.

301
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,602
Oh, yeah, thanks.

302
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,037
- Okay.
-         -Perfect.

303
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,474
       350 to 280 to 120.
       One hundred!

304
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,707
<i>420 to 180 to 130.</i>

305
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,655
                      Hey, uh...

306
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,524
                    Sorry, um...

307
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,195
     Did I get the wrong house?
     I'm looking for a Tim guy.

308
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,197
Oh, yeah,
     Tim's in the kitchen.

309
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,865
                       Hey, man!

310
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,066
  Whoa!

311
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,835
       Look at this guy!

312
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,070
       -What's up, homie?
       -Yes, man!

313
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,271
       -You made it.
       -Look at this guy.

314
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,207
           Look at this
           beautiful face.

315
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,310
      And the fucking bod!

316
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,113
- Hey, man.
-        -I'm so glad       you came, man.

317
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,248
 -Good, I'm so glad to be here,
 -I miss you.

318
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,617
   What are you guys doing,
   dick-sucking-cock fest
   over here?

319
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,752
  -What's happening?
  -No. Hey, let's get a beer.

320
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,189
- What's going on?
-        -You fucking       made it, man!

321
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:50,194
   The Weight Watchers points
   just on the hamburger bun
   is like 12-13 points.

322
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,863
         No hamburger.

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,834
                 Ray, you want
                 one of these?

324
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,536
So they were literally
 I'd say about three feet apart
 from each other.

325
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,104
Any more people
     coming to the...

326
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,241
I found this,
which I don't know
what that is.

327
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,276
  And then I found that, man.

328
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,578
What the fuck?

329
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,679
         Grab it. Yeah.

330
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,715
     Wow.

331
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,117
   -That was in the...
   -That was in the... Yeah.

332
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,420
I mean, that was probably
a foot and a half in the ground
and that's on the hill,
but check it out.

333
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,422
I mean,
the land is crazy.

334
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,926
  -That's beautiful,
  look at that.
  -That's pretty awesome, man.

335
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:25,930
   Tim, you want a peanut butter
   and boysenberry sandwich?

336
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,267
Well, what do we...
Let's go down there
and let's dig this shit up.

337
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,235
     I did. Well, I got
     this out there,

338
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,937
Well, let's keep digging.

339
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,572
  -Why don't we keep digging?
  -Yeah.

340
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,074
        I think we're gonna
        just sort of hang here.

341
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,676
            -I'm in.
            -Yeah.

342
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,411
Let's do this.

343
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,880
- Let's hold it down.
  You guys, let's hang here...
  -Come on. Let's go.

344
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,283
      Okay,
      that's you.

345
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,251
All right.

346
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,903
              Come on,
              it's gonna be fun.

347
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,271
                          Yeah?

348
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,177
This is great.

349
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,880
What are you doing?
    Watch your steps    right here, guys.

350
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,985
     That's it, down there.

351
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,590
    So this is where
    I found the bone, guys.

352
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,260
   And then right here
   I dug a little bit deeper,
   if you see that hole,

353
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,028
   this is where the gun was.

354
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,365
   So, Adam, you wanna
   jump up there?
   You mind taking the lead?

355
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,133
 Paul, you wanna get in there?
 Yeah, awesome.

356
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,468
          Actually,
          leave that light.

357
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,503
     Yeah, and then if we
     just get in here...

358
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,906
   -Ray, you wanna...
   You and me can work this.
   -Yeah.

359
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,942
Uh, and Phil, just,
you know, I mean,
like, whatever you want, buddy.

360
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,723
You can't just dig up   someone's yard.
   I think it's illegal.

361
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,562
           Holy shit!

362
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:11,068
    Dudes, a license plate.
    Nevada. 5752673.

363
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,304
       -Wow.
       -That's like, wow!

364
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,707
  It's just gar...
  There's garbage in the ground.

365
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,110
         If you dig far enough
         you'll find a landfill.

366
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,413
Stop, Phil.
       Stop, man.
       This is really
       fucking exciting.

367
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,081
  -That's a great find, dude.
  -Thanks, man.

368
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,616
I think this is
a good area.

369
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,985
    -So that was right here?
    -Yeah, let's stick
    around here then.

370
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,820
 Look, if you don't wanna dig,

371
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,590
         how about
         some hookers?

372
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,694
   No, no, I, uh...
   That's sort of an
   illogical jump you just made.

373
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:40,231
         You went from digging
         in the yard to hookers?

374
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,968
             That seems
             sort of irrational.

375
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,803
              I was having
              a great time.

376
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,171
      You wanna play 500?

377
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,873
        Yeah, we could play 500.

378
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,409
  Guys, stop fighting, stop it.
  Let's just enjoy--

379
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,512
   I'm not fighting.
   I'm actually being inquisi...
   I'm really asking
   a real question.

380
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,815
   Let's just enjoy the moment.
   There could be a dead body
   right beneath us.

381
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,685
    You know, it's pretty
    fucking exciting, Phil.

382
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,487
   -It could be any--
   -Well, I mean, you know,

383
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,922
if Phil doesn't
wanna dig, that's cool.

384
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,792
I'm not gonna judge him
He doesn't have to dig.

385
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,761
But I'm just saying,
is there an alternative

386
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,132
to digging?
Do you have
another alternative?

387
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,468
Because I'm game.
I'm open to ideas.

388
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,270
   -Go to a bar or something?
   -What the fuck is that?

389
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,471
It was right there.

390
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,406
      -You just found it?
      -Yeah.

391
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,142
   Hold on, let me see that.
   Are you kidding me, dude?

392
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,577
It was right there.

393
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,250
              This is too weird
              for me, man.

394
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,153
     Wow, this is for real.

395
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,455
        Admit it, Phil.

396
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,557
              It's strange.
              That's strange.

397
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,060
        Let me see that.
        Look at that.

398
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,296
       -All right.
       -That's some real
       <i> Quest for Fire...</i>

399
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,466
  -We gotta go deep.
  We gotta go all the way out.
  <i> -...2001</i> shit, right there.

400
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,935
             ...for a cadaver,
             they're worth
             a lot of money.

401
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,970
            I know.

402
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,272
          No. I mean,
          I know that, I think,
          from like...

403
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,841
     I'm gonna get a beer.

404
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,910
               Yes, please.

405
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:04,048
 But I do know that for a fact
 because I think
 back in the '60s...

406
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,083
          -Holy shit.
          -You okay?

407
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,151
    Phil, are you all right?

408
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,387
I think I'll be
all right long-term.

409
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,622
         Aah!

410
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,724
    -You're sure?
    -No, I'll be all right.
    I'll be all right.

411
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,227
       I think we should call it
       a night, don't you think?

412
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,362
                 So it's on.
                 It's happening?

413
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,964
   What's happening, brother?

414
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,833
 It's on. Billy T's coming.
 He's bringing these two broads.

415
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,201
     Tango is coming here?

416
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,270
             Yeah, he's bringing
             some fucking tarts.
             I don't know...

417
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,471
          It's gonna be awesome.

418
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,340
Who's Billy T?

419
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,308
             Tango. Tango. Yeah.

420
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,177
        He's coming now.

421
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,446
                He's coming now.
                Right now.

422
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,148
Timmy, we should, uh...

423
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,151
We should talk
this out, right?

424
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,721
    Tango is coming, man.
    It's gonna be beautiful.

425
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,990
Yeah, I, uh...

426
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,826
We should probably check
before the evening changes.

427
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,897
Don't break that.
Jude loves it.

428
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,067
        Are you, are you okay?
        Do you need me?
        You need me here?

429
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,238
I don't know.
Not unless you wanna come.
I mean, if you wanna stay, stay.

430
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,676
         No, I'm gonna go.
         I just want you to know
         I'm here for you.

431
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,145
        -Yeah, I'm good.
        -Okay.

432
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,081
      -You're okay?
      -I'm gonna go.
      Yeah, no, it's good.

433
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm gonna put you in.
  Put your legs in.

434
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,655
Really nice to meet you.

435
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,457
         There we go.
         There we go.

436
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,325
- Hey!
-         Hello!

437
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,860
         Hey, come on!

438
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,664
- Hey, what's up, man?
-      -Yeah!

439
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,199
- What's going on?
-        -Tango!

440
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,134
        We're doing it?
        We're doing it?

441
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,770
        What's up, man?

442
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,672
  -It's good to see you, bro.
  -It's good to see you.

443
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,808
            Hello. Hi. That was
            the ride of my life.

444
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,276
    I think we should
    do it for America.

445
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,644
             Tango?

446
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,014
       Girls, want a hit
       or something?

447
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,584
          Hi. Thank you so much
          for having us over.

448
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,486
- Hey, thanks for coming.
 -That's so nice.

449
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:52,823
Cougars are getting
 younger. Like, when I was...
 Like, MILFs were like...

450
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,359
- Now the MILFs are       like 28, right?
-        -Yeah.

451
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,094
And the cougars
    are like...

452
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,630
Can we go in the house,
    is that okay?

453
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:02,032
      -Is it cool if we go
      in the house?
      -Yeah.

454
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,801
        I'm gonna make the girls
        squirt tonight.

455
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,871
          Easy, easy.

456
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,572
        -Check you out.
        -Use a condom,
        at least.

457
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,841
    -What do you think
    of the other one?
    You like the other one?
    -Beautiful.

458
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,344
Yeah. I mean,
I'd do anything
but we gotta
give him first dibs.

459
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,780
   -No. You guys fuckin'...
   Are you kidding me?
   You... Fuck you, fuck you.
   -Come on, man.

460
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,216
You know what
      his wife said?

461
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,318
You're crazy, man.

462
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,653
Who do you want, man?

463
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,588
No, but I want you
    to be happy.

464
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,458
     What the fuck is this, man?
     Peanut butter and jelly?

465
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,428
It's kind of nice
to just hang out.
And I actually miss
seeing you, man.

466
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,097
           You don't want
           a little side action?

467
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,331
        -I miss you too.
        -Yeah.

468
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,300
Hey, man,
you got some coke on your...

469
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,738
      -Speak of the devil.
      -Yeah.

470
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,673
It's crazy having a kid.

471
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,742
It fucking changes...

472
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,312
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.
I have these conversations
with you in my head.

473
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,614
             No sleep. No sleep.

474
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,616
               No sleep.

475
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,418
That's part of it.

476
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,121
              I couldn't do it.
              No sleep, man.

477
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,524
 -Yeah, the sleeples--
 -How do you, how do you sleep?

478
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,293
       Yeah, yeah.

479
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,062
             I can't do it.
             I gotta sleep, man.

480
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,397
Also, there's a person--

481
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,032
              I mean, I'm not...

482
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:11,602
    I can't do that. I can't...
    I gotta sleep, man.

483
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,871
The lack of sleep
fucks with you, man, but...

484
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,607
You know, there's, like,
this human being
just looking up to me to be--

485
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,642
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

486
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,011
      -Jesus!
      -Is your wife cool?

487
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:28,152
 Is she cool? I mean,
 does she let you hang out?
 Does she let you have some time
 and be free and be cool?

488
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,020
               Can you hang out?

489
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,489
She's great, you know,
all bullshit aside.

490
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,792
       -You're not trapped?
       -No.

491
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:37,194
       -No, you know--
       -I can't fucking
       handle that, man.

492
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,363
You know,
              I can't fucking...

493
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,366
           I can't handle
           being trapped, man,
           you know what I mean?

494
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,640
 -Whoo!
 -I did it, I did it, I did it!

495
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,008
Just give me
one good thing.

496
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,110
                Ray-ray!

497
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,381
              Oh!

498
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,728
                 Whoa!

499
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,096
             What are you doing?

500
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,298
        Uh...

501
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,733
     Just digging
     for something.

502
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,534
             -Cool.
             -Yeah.

503
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,904
         For something?
         What kind of something?

504
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,539
         -What's that?
         -What?

505
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:26,744
I just found uh,
some stuff earlier.
I found like a bone and...

506
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,380
       Yeah.

507
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:33,651
You're amazing. Look at you.
What are you, Fred Astaire?
You're gonna tap dance for me,

508
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:39,490
You gonna fucking...
Get in the pool

509
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,560
It's not... This isn't my house,
so I'm not moving it all out
I'm just...

510
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,229
          -This isn't?
          -No.

511
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:48,932
My wife and I
are staying here
for a few weeks.

512
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,301
            -Sweet.
            -Yeah.

513
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,303
      -That's a good deal.
      -It's a great deal.

514
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,872
             Yeah.

515
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,280
                I wanna help you
                find the body.

516
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,051
Well, there's a shovel
right there.

517
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,019
               Great, that's all
               I needed to hear.

518
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,856
           <i> Chica! Chica! Chica!</i>

519
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,126
Yeah, where is that<i> chica?</i>

520
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,194
                I don't know.

521
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,495
Get that<i> chica</i> over here.

523
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,352
   -Yeah, that's nice.
   -You're bringing it, huh?

524
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,054
        I could do this.

525
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,456
               I got it.

526
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

527
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:06,310
-Oh, it's colder than I thought!
-Hey, man! Don't try
and have sex with me.

528
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,446
Oh, I didn't know
  it was time to show off.

529
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,057
                   Oh, that
                   wasn't funny.

00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,186

531
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,241
Hey, give me that...

532
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,149
       Hey.

533
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,222
I gotta show this to Ray.
He's gonna lose his shit.

534
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,424
 -What did you find?
 -Ray, I found a shoe, buddy!

535
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,160
- A what?
-         -Ray! Ray!

536
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,462
Ray! Ray.

537
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,165
Ray, I found a shoe.

538
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,567
  Hey, man,
  that's awesome.

539
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,936
  Dude, I found a shoe.
  It was right by the gun, so...

540
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,470
     -That's great. Let me
     check it out, man.
     -Yeah, man.

541
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,239
      -It's unbelievable.
      -That's awesome, bro.

542
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:45,776
     Yeah, that was prob--
     Oh, no, no, no! No.

543
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,611
         Oh, man, Ray.

544
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:51,148
- What do you got there?
  You got a joint?
  -Yeah.

545
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,250
              You threw the shoe
              in the pool, man.

546
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,986
                        Oh, man.

547
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,754
        -How's it doing?
        -Yeah, it's good.

548
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,057
    -Smoting...
    Smoking up marijuana...
    -Smoting?

549
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,927
 I think if there's any clue
 that says that there's somebody
 out there, Ray, it's this.

550
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,029
  ...smoke the dutchie often,
  if you know what I mean.

551
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,432
              Who would
              just throw this...

552
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,067
              It's fucking nuts.

553
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,203
I can't even understand
 what you're saying anymore.

554
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,038
         All right,
         I'm gonna hit the sack.

555
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,143
                All right, guys.

556
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,411
          All right,
          good night, everybody.

557
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,714
        It's like you got Jekyll
        and then you got Hyde.

558
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:27,184
- And then you got Jekyll,
and then you get Hyde.
- Stay as long as you want.
Enjoy the night.

559
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,419
   -You know what I mean?
   You punk rock?
   -I don't wanna look at it.

560
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,622
     Oh, shit.

561
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:36,059
- I'm gonna fucking...
 -I will whip this at you!

562
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,134
- Okay, okay, okay.

563
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,787
- This is a crossroads.
-  -Mm-hmm.

564
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,757
- This is
 a very important--
 -It's not a crossroads.

565
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,492
The kid's three years old.

566
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,829
- But, darling...
-    -It's not   the crossroads of his life.

567
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,497
- Right.
-         -Yes.

568
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,434
    You think the best education
    he could possibly get
    is in a public school?

569
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:29,206
          No, actually, I don't.
          But sometimes I think
          it's a compromise.

570
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,308
What? No.
It doesn't have to be
a compromise.

571
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,210
       -It is. Marriage
       is a compromise.
       -Why?

572
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,945
  -Well, life's a compromise.
  -Yes, but--

573
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,015
     -Life's a compromise.
     -Can we stop talking
     in platitudes?

574
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,783
     -Life's a compromise.
     -Please? Look.

575
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:43,887
We think it's important
for him to have
the best education
that he can have

576
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,322
    -and I know you do too.
    -Mm-hmm.

577
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,557
And so now you're under
the cover of your marriage.

578
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,459
       -And Tim does too.
       -I...

579
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:53,630
Tim is prejudiced
because he works
in the public school system

580
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:54,931
and that's
the difference.

581
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,666
 That's kind of harsh.
 I don't think he's prejudiced.

582
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,435
-He just believes in the pu--
-It's not harsh, it's the truth.

583
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,971
- I feel like the voices     are getting really...
-      -Mama!

584
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:03,807
    -I'm sorry, buddy. Yeah?
    -I'm sorry.

585
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,576
        Oh, wait. I think I know
        what I need to do.

586
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,412
I know what
I need to do.

587
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,887
  I think I have 15 blueberries
  and you have 14.

588
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,390
No, I have 15 too.

589
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,792
            -You do?
            -Yeah.

590
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,760
                Look, I have 16.

591
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,431
            We're getting a lot
            of anti-oxidants.

592
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,134
Okay.

593
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,220
- <i> Knock, knock.</i>
-   -<i> Who's there?</i>

594
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,522
          <i> -Orange.</i>
          <i> -Orange who?</i>

595
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,257
         <i> -Knock, knock.</i>
         <i> -Who's there?</i>

596
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,992
          <i> -Banana.</i>
          <i> -Banana who?</i>

597
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,894
         -Knock, knock.
         -Who's there?

598
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,563
          -Banana.
          -Banana who?

599
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,633
                 Didn't you glad
                 I didn't say...

600
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:04,935
Orange?

601
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,670
           I'm just waiting
           to get my life back.

602
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,305
What does that mean?

603
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:12,943
    When did it come back?
    When do you go from being...

604
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,246
   I mean, you know,
   it's the great joy of my life
   to be...

605
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,882
       -I did it.
       -I know you did.
       Thank you, buddy.

606
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,283
           To be mom.

607
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,019
 But when am I mom and...
 All right, you wanna step in?

608
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,988
          I'm gonna do this one.
          All right, step in.

609
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,692
       I'm asking you
       when did you feel like
       you got back to yourself?

610
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,061
When I divorced
your father.

611
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,096
             I knew you were
             gonna say that.

612
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,397
        Can you zip these up?

613
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,833
No, I'm not
recommending divorce.

614
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,503
 No, I thought you were
 gonna say, "I'm not kidding."
 I'm like, I know you're not.

615
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,705
        Can you zip these up
        for me? You know
        how to do that part.

616
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:47,577
But there was something truthful
about my having
my own life again.

617
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,413
Doing pretty good
for an old man.

618
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,283
- I feel like an old man.

619
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,651
              <i> It's hard to have</i>
               <i> a separate life.</i>

620
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,587
    -You do, though?
    -Yeah, I feel like I do.

621
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,056
       But I think
       it's the hardest thing,
       somehow, getting married.

622
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:05,262
   It's like, well am I a couple
   or am I still the person,
   you know?

623
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,130
                  It's really...

624
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:13,370
   It's key to remain the person
   that brought something
   to a relationship.

625
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,639
          And being in love,
          man, we being in love.

626
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:20,911
        What is that?
        Getting what you want
        or is it giving somebody
        what they want?

627
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,382
           Sacrificing, if you
           want to call it that.

628
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,883
<i> Two, three.</i>

629
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,451
            -Cheese!
            -Cheese!

630
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,287
   Okay, you wanna come down?

631
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,521
           Uh...

632
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,423
      Here, you want me
      to give you a push?

633
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,959
      Okay, I'll give you
      a little push.

634
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,596
         Whoa, oh, whoa!

635
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:44,201
     Can I take a picture of you
     with Grandma and Pop-pop?

636
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,504
      No? I gotta take a picture
      for Daddy.

637
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,934
                  All right.

638
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,591
        -Hey, neighbor.
        -Oh, hey.

639
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,228
 -Sorry, I should have called.
 -No. Stop. How are you?

640
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,664
        I'm good, I just brought
        something up for Lee.

641
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,966
Oh, she and the boy
are gone for the weekend.

642
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,369
        -Oh, they are?
        -Yeah. Oh, okay.

643
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,604
Wanna get a cup
of coffee or something?
You wanna come in?

644
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,440
           Uh, I don't wanna be
           any trouble.

645
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,509
Better than not
doing anything.

646
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,012
Here you go,
my friend.

647
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,247
               That's all I get?

648
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,617
   -That's all that's left?
   -Yeah, that's all that...

649
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,120
     -I mean, it's yours
     if you want it, but...
     -Nah.

650
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,389
Sorry about that,
it's my friend's.
I don't do cocaine, actually.

651
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,491
     -I don't either.
     -Yeah, I'm a weed guy.

652
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:18,395
     You know, if you need
     a little bit of help
     digging your swimming pool
     down there,

653
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,363
        I got a brother-in-law
        that does that business.

654
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,666
Oh, no, the...
Last night.

655
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,035
No, we were just
goofing around, just...

656
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,637
         -Yeah?
         -Yeah. I uh...

657
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,006
I'd found...
I'd been doing
a little gardening for Julia

658
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,043
and I found some stuff
and, you know,
it was interesting.

659
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,881
Doing some Indiana Jones
stuff, I guess.

660
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,685
       Well, a lot of weird shit
       happened around here.

661
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,153
Man, you said it.

662
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,921
That's the stuff
I like to get into.

663
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,856
                   Oh, really?

664
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,426
Yeah, it's fun.

665
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,996
                Well, sometimes
                not so much fun.

666
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:57,334
      You want all those spirits
      to come up here
      and join your family?

667
00:38:57,336 --> 00:39:01,438
Well, that's interesting.
That was kind of the debate.
'Cause Lee said
not to mess with it.

668
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,506
    -Yeah.
    -She said it was kind of
    none of my business.

669
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,343
But my thought is like,
there's something in me,
and I don't know
if you can relate to this,

670
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:11,147
but there's something,
if there's something down there,
part of me has got to know
what it is.

671
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:17,087
Well, I know what it is,
but there ain't no way
I'm gonna go digging down there.

672
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,891
- Right? Have all that shit
   come back on my family.

673
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,195
           You don't wanna find
           anything down there,
           believe me.

674
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,435
Yeah, I know.

675
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,106
    The Chicano Hall of Fame
    is down there.

676
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,277
 Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

677
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,299
<i> And I keep thinking</i>
   <i> the older I get</i>
   <i> the more I'm gonna know,</i>

678
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:13,903
     and I don't,
     I'm just getting older
     and fatter, and, like,
     more broken down.

679
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,474
        And that's true.

680
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,509
     You know when you talk
     to like an old man,
     or at least for me,

681
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,745
you know, they'll say like,
"It's weird when we talk
because I feel your age,"

682
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,814
   and then I look
   in the mirror and I'm not.

683
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,517
        -That's starting
        to happen.
        -Oh, really?

684
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,388
With... I'm like... This is...
I was with two 16-year-old boys
and we were, like,
goofing around,

685
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,756
           Why were you with
           two 16-year-old boys?

686
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,625
     -It was a work thing.
     I'm a teacher.
     -Oh, okay.

687
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,095
      But we were, like,
      having fun,
      and, like, laughing
      and doing bits.

688
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,165
We were doing like,
"Ooh, kill 'em, kill 'em."
and they're like, "You don't..."

689
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,033
       And we were like,
       all laughing.

690
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,804
   And I saw the reflection
   of this, like, of the car
   in the

691
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:50,406
      and I was so old,
      and they were so...

692
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:54,077
     And I had that thought
     of like, wow!

693
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,747
  But I didn't feel different
  when we were having fun.

694
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,917
  And that made me feel like,
  I am gonna die.

695
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,490
             -Hey!
             -Yeah?

696
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,425
I found something!
I found something!

697
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,760
        Ooh!

698
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,095
       Holy shit.

699
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,968
I just found a bag of bones.

700
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,237
          Oh, my God.

701
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,072
So somebody
had bones...

702
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,008
             Chopped them up,
             put them in a bag,
             put them in here.

703
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,079
Yeah, here.
It's an awesome find.

704
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:07,850
     This is so cool. It's like,
     the most weird
     Easter egg hunt.

705
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,186
     -Oh, God.
     -Good job, good find.

706
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,654
           Thank you.

707
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,089
              Mom?

708
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,772
              Mom?

709
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:43,119
           Okay, give me a kiss.
           Mwah.

710
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,389
-All right, you're gonna play
with Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
-Okay.

711
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,625
        -I love you.
        -I love you too.

712
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,060
                       Have fun!

713
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,495
                   Bye, Grandma.

714
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,741
              Hi.

715
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,843
       -Hey. Are you Lee?
       -I am.

716
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,945
        Oh, good.
        I'm so glad I found you.

717
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:13,316
-The GPS took me...
-I know.
It always goes up Deerpath
and then you can't get through.

718
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,018
              I know, I'm sorry.

719
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,619
      So am I.

720
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,254
Where are you going?

721
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,056
 -Big Brackwood.
 I'll tell you how to get there.
 -Oh, awesome.

722
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,630
Was that your house?

723
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,333
        No, no.
        I mean, I wish.

724
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,903
 Well, I don't know if I wish.
 I mean, it was my mom's house.

725
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,172
      -It's really nice.
      -It is really nice.

726
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,508
   My house is not very nice.

727
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,642
       No.

728
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,344
   No. We live on the east side.

729
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,979
    -Oh, okay.
    -Yeah, Atwater Village.

730
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,514
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know where that is.

731
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:48,151
      Yeah, we don't even
      live in a house.
      We live in a duplex.

732
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:51,654
-That's still nice.
You can pretend to have a house.
-Yeah, I know, right?

733
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:54,390
    Sort of. I think we thought
    we were gonna move out of it
    and get a house

734
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,126
   several years ago,
   but it hasn't panned out yet.

735
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,995
I kind of like
driving around over here

736
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,498
because I can sort of pretend
that I live in one of these
giant houses.

737
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,567
               Right?

738
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,503
But I always wonder
if I would be happier
if I lived in one of these,
instead of an apartment?

739
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:11,674
      I think I read this study,
      or my husband told me
      about this study,

740
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,509
     because we talk about
     this stuff a lot,

741
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:18,047
   that they did for Harvard
   or something
   where they said you actually,

742
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:22,285
        people with money
        actually are happier,
        live marginally happier,

743
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,823
    and then it kind of plateaus
    and they're as unhappy
    as everybody else,

744
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:30,626
     but they are
     a little bit happier.

745
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:34,230
      Where are my two
      favorite munchkins?

746
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,199
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

747
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,901
  -How are you doing, darling?
  -Hi, Lee. Good.

748
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,803
 -So good to see you.
 -Hey, guys, you remember Lee?

749
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:44,373
Oh, my God, you're all wet.
I can't even hug you.

750
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,875
High-five. Two hands.

751
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,643
         You remember
         Auntie Lee?

752
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:49,846
   On the side. In the hole.

753
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:51,080
        You've got soul.

754
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,683
    -Hi, how are you?
    -Good. Good to see you.

755
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:55,318
     -Good to see you too.
     -Oh, this is Lucy.

756
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,554
     -Hi, I'm Lucy.
     Nice to meet you.
     -Hi. Nice to meet you.

757
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,690
         -It's amazing.
         -Wow.

758
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,795
        -Here you go.
        -Thank you.

759
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,296
- Cheers, you guys.
-        -Cheers.

760
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:11,334
            I have been counting
            the minutes
            to this reunion.

761
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:12,668
You wanna
cheers me or no?

762
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,337
         -Yeah, cheers.
         -Okay.

763
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,174
You, if you would give
that to me, I would win too.

764
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,810
            -Okay.
            -I win!

765
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,678
       -How is he doing?
       -He's so good.

766
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,347
      I wanna eat him every day.

767
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,548
You could have bought him.

768
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,950
     You know he needs some time
     with Grandma and Pop-pop,

769
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,920
            and Mommy
            needs some time too.

770
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,789
      -How old is he now?
      -Three.

771
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,258
      -Oh.
      -Yeah, it goes fast.

772
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,360
 -Yeah, it's been a long time.
 -Yeah.

773
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:42,899
 I mean, part of me wishes
 we could have someone,
 you know, full-time, live-in...

774
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:46,035
  You could do it. I mean,
  we just found her, you know?

775
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,639
   Um, she knew
   somebody from work, so...

776
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,341
           Do you mind if I ask
           how much you pay her?

777
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,110
         -Very little.
         -Yeah.

778
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,813
  But lives in the guest house
  it's kind of a big draw.

779
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,949
There's kind of a deal.
She's like an actress,

780
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,952
and she is auditioning.
We're kind of flexible.

781
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:05,621
It's not...
It's an interesting...

782
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:08,691
I think she's great.
I think she fits in really well.
The kids love her.

783
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,895
Here's the, here's the thing.
Tell me how you feel about this.

784
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:18,034
We are gonna go to Costa Rica
on a family vacation.

785
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,602
It was gonna be us
and the kids.

786
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,338
    -It's still gonna be us
    and the kids.
    -I'm excited about it.

787
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,909
But suddenly, Bob thinks
that Lucy should come.

788
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,412
-No. Okay, here's what happened.
-For the whole time.

789
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:31,480
     Here's what happened.
     Squitch says...

790
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,253
    -What do you think about
    Costa Rica, right?
    -Uh-huh.

791
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:40,756
      We penciled in Costa Rica,
      starting on the 10th,

792
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:43,626
   because that was the week
   that seemed like
   it was gonna be open.

793
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:45,995
Everybody agreed
to the 10th.

794
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:48,464
   -My schedule doesn't work
   like your schedule works.
   -The 10th is good.

795
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:52,535
   -I know what it is three,
   four months in advance.
   -I started planning...
   Well, it does. It can.

796
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,870
It can, it can
if you want it to.

797
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,339
   -It can't. It can't.
   -It can if you want it to.

798
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,374
   -Okay, sure,
   if I wanna call the client...
   -If you communicate...

799
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,310
...and say,
"We're gonna drop the account.
Sorry, we're not ready,

800
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,379
                 "and I'm going
                 to Costa Rica."

801
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,282
If you communicate
and you talk to me
when you find out
that it's not a good date,

802
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,917
you tell me then,
so I can change things.

803
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,218
            So I have a project,
            that went over,

804
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,320
               and we've got
               a lot of options.

805
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,557
        One of the options is,
        we can postpone the trip
        and we can go...

806
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,294
Why don't you have
just like a nice night
and have some, like, you time

807
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,631
     -and, like, read a,
     read a book...
     -What does that mean?

808
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:26,068
I feel so shitty.
I don't even know
what I'm saying to you.

809
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,304
         You're saying
         you don't wanna go out.

810
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,973
 -I'm saying I can't, I can't.
 -I know, I know.

811
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,010
  I was really
  looking forward to tonight.

812
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:38,314
Like, on a level
        that I can't even
        describe to you, but...

813
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,950
<i> You sure you can't do it?</i>
  <i> You can't push it?</i>

814
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:45,454
 <i> I know, and I'm supposed</i>
 <i> to just let you off the hook,</i>
 <i> but I'm being so selfish</i>
 <i> and just pushing for my needs.</i>

815
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,725
<i>I was so excited to see you</i>
<i>and I wanted to be</i>
<i>able to do it,</i>

816
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:53,029
  <i> but I haven't done anything</i>
  <i> for like two months.</i>

817
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,630
<i> Maybe you need to get out.</i>

818
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,771
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

819
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,340
  -What do you say we call it?
  -Call it?

820
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,575
Yeah. I'll buy you some dinner
as a thank you.

821
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,179
            -Yeah.
            -You in?

822
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,381
           My clothes are
           pretty dirty, though.

823
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,083
I'll find you
some clean clothes.

824
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,619
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

825
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,322
             -Good.
             -Good.

826
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,111
I want...

827
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,019
             Whoa.

828
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,589
      -What's up, Timmy?
      -Hey, Phil, my boy.

829
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,958
         -How are you?
         -How are you?

830
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,260
       -Good.
       -How was the rest
       of the night?

831
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,830
   -Great, and Tango came by,
   it was fun.
   -Yeah?

832
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,665
             What you up to?
             What are you doing?

833
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,335
Just, uh, I was just
  in the neighborhood,
  heading to soccer practice.

834
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,838
- You're dressed like Ray.
-    -Hey, Tim?

835
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,439
        These don't fit.

836
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,808
I don't wanna go
in the closet, but...

837
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,143
         Let's get you
         something else to wear.

838
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,745
             Okay.

839
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,380
           -Hi.
           -Hi there.

840
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,382
- Thank you.
-        -Yeah.

841
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,265
<i> Take anything you want.</i>

842
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,666
     -Just whatever? Uh...
     -Honestly.

843
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,935
Yeah, just grab anything
and I'll meet you downstairs.

844
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:41,737
           -Anything?
           -Anything.

845
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,074
          Thank you.

846
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,692
       -Tim.
       -What's up, man?

847
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,661
 Listen, I got to uh...
 Just talk to me for a second.

848
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,330
      Phil, I want to clean off
      that table so I won't have
      to do it later.

849
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,801
Listen, I wanna talk to you
because you're not
yourself right now,

850
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:13,636
you're like in this
other head space,

851
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,806
and, uh, I just wanna
talk to you about, like...

852
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:19,341
I feel like we should
jut go out for dinner,
like, just drop these guys.

853
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,644
              I have plans, man.
              I'm going out
              with my friend.

854
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,779
  -No, but it would be fun
  It would be just you and me.
  -Yeah.

855
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,783
And we can kind of shed this
because I feel like you're,
whoo, you know what I mean?

856
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:31,420
You're just
in this other place
and I just wanna
bring you back.

857
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,223
    What do you think
    is going on here?
    What are you implying, Phil?

858
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,560
 -I don't know what's going on.
 -I made a friend
 and I'm going out
 to eat with her.

859
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:41,464
Yeah, I'm not
involved with this.
As a matter of fact, when...

860
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:44,533
I'm friends with your wife.
I know your kid.

861
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:49,338
             Phil, Phil.
             You're a good dude.
             But I've known you
             for two years.

862
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,008
      -Relax. I'm fine.
      I'm a man. Okay?
      -I'm just saying...

863
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,247
I'm just saying, for
when I'm out with your wife
and, you know, when we're
on double dates,

864
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,116
I don't wanna be
an accomplice to this.

865
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,817
                 There's not...
                 Okay, stop.

866
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:06,789
Your... That coat looks
ridiculous, it doesn't
even button properly.

867
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:10,426
And the hat, you know,
it's practically the summer.
You're gonna be boiling.

868
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,962
<i>By the time we actually</i>

869
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,831
got the divorce itself,
it was over, so...

870
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,134
            Were you devastated?

871
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:21,804
Oh, I was,
I was a fucking mess.
I was, you know,

872
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,973
sobbing into the sink
every morning.

873
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,076
You know, like,
it was, it was just terrible.

874
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:33,215
But, um, since then
it's been, you know,
revelatory, you know.

875
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:36,719
And life is someplace
where I never found it before.

876
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:43,225
You know, you live a whole...
You grow up with your parents,
and you have roommates,
and you do all this stuff

877
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:47,930
and all of a sudden
you're, you're exactly
what you wanna be, sort of.

878
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,733
    -Now.
    -Now. Really, it's uh...

879
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:56,238
It's pretty amazing, you know?
No compromises.

880
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,274
--No compromises.

881
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:03,879
Nothing that really requires
anything but your own desires.

882
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:06,615
The thing is,
you just gotta figure out
what they are.

883
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,662
<i> When you decide</i>
      <i> what you're interested in</i>

884
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,632
          and it's,
          if you're not seeking,
          then there's no part,

885
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,435
        and you are
        in a moment of your life
        where you are seeking.

886
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:02,271
     -Mm-hmm.
     -So something like
     taking ayahuasca,

887
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,406
  which would be
  really scary for me right now,

888
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,976
            is really exciting
            and really scary.

889
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:11,313
Because if it shifts
everything up for you,
well, this is the time to do it.

890
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:14,750
      Well, I'm not set in
      anything right now.
      You're like
      set in your thing.

891
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:19,822
              I think what is,
              is everything
              that excites me
              is what he's doing

892
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:23,859
        and not how
        I'm reacting to it,
        and not how
        it's affecting my brain.

893
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:27,329
 It feels like
 what's happening to me
 and what's happening to my wife

894
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,964
         kind of doesn't matter.

895
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:32,868
  -Mm-hmm.
  -And there's a bit of a loss
  that happens between us

896
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,871
       because our thing,
       our connection, our love,

897
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:40,676
  and I know it's wrong
  and I know we always like...
  We have, like, rules of, like,
  make sure we always connect,

898
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:45,014
       it's just so much more
       exciting to put
       everything into that kid,

899
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:48,183
           in their love,
           in their development,
           in their thought,

900
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,687
      and, you know,
      you lose yourself in that.

901
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,822
All right?

902
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,059
Hi. Can I just sit
at the bar?

903
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:59,061
         -Yeah, please.
         -Thank you.

904
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,332
    -How you doing?
    -Good, good, thank you.

905
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,733
Want a drink?

906
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,904
       Do you need help?

907
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:13,709
Oh, no, thank you.
Um, I'll have a martini
with a twist.

908
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:17,146
       Wait, I haven't seen this
       in so long,
       I eat here all the time.

909
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,814
                   What are you
                   gonna get?

910
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,818
- I was thinking about...
-        uh...

911
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,321
   -Do you guys have burgers?
   -Yeah, we do.

912
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,022
     I don't see it on the menu.
     Awesome.

913
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,757
           -Here you go.
           -Perfect.

914
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,225
        You have beautiful eyes.

915
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,562
   -Thank you. I'm just gonna
   scoot over here.
   -What color are they?

916
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:37,800
Um, I think they're hazel.
I think that's what it says
on my driver's license.

917
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:46,675
Hey.

918
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,648
Uh-oh.

919
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,050
Brian, what are
you doing, man?

920
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57,353
  -I'm just coming...
  She was telling me about...
  -You good?

921
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,954
      No, I'm good. Yeah.

922
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,024
     What, are these chips?
     Why did you get chips?

923
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,560
   -I'm enjoying some chips.
   Do you want some?
   -Yeah.

924
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,129
Eat some chips.

925
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,630
Did you eat
enough tonight?

926
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,601
      -No?
      -A little. I, uh...

927
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,470
Maybe one too many
to drink, huh?

928
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:15,804
       I don't think so.

929
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,406
Mmm, leave some.

930
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,142
      What are you doing?

931
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,445
               I'm just texting
               my husband.

932
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,948
    -Wait, those are haz...
    You're married?
    -Mm-hmm.

933
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,750
          Since when?

934
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,654
                   Since 2004.

935
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,656
         I'm so sorry.
         I'm so sorry.

936
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,825
       Let's go, bud.
       Come on outside,
       let's go.

937
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,327
Excuse me.

938
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:41,130
     -Nice meeting you.
     -Nice to meet you too.

939
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,699
              She's really
              not interested.
              Come on, let's go.

940
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:47,169
 -Brian, it's time to leave.
 It's time to leave.
 -No. Please, please. Seriously.

941
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,471
- Really?
   -It's time to leave.
   Let's go.

942
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,540
   Come on, out the door.
   Brian, I'm serious. Relax.

943
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,941
No, no, man,
I'm serious.

944
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:53,942
Listen, dude.

945
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,844
- Why are you doing this?
- Because...

946
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,383
- Oh, fuck!
        -Oh, my God.

947
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,452
- You!
-        -Fuck you.

948
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:05,287
- Would you just      go home?
-       -No.

949
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,089
Fuck!

950
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,659
         Fucking loser.

951
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:12,928
- You okay, dude?
  -Honey, will you just

952
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,597
- get him a cab          or something?
-           Yeah.

953
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,033
      I apologize. Sorry.

954
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,335
Here you go.

955
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:25,007
Thank you. Okay. I feel like
this is gonna hurt a little bit.
Can I see it?

956
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,742
    -Can you take this away?
    -It's gonna be fine.

957
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:29,278
      -Can you just take it
      for a second?
      -Sure.

958
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,047
               Okay. Oh, yeah,
               yeah, yeah. Okay.

959
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,783
         This is like a total...

960
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,519
It's fine, honestly.
It's really not a big deal.

961
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:39,254
-And you're gonna need stitches.
-No, I'm not.

962
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,757
    -Oh, yes. Yes, you are.
    No, you really are.
    -No, I'm not.

963
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:44,660
I'm not going to a hospital.
I hate hospitals.
I fucking hate them.

964
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,929
     -Ow. Okay
     -Oops, sorry, sorry.

965
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,737
         Yeah, you're gonna need
         some stitches.

966
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,541
You know what we'll do, I have a
friend, she's a medical student.
We'll go to her place.

967
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:02,511
-Yeah, I don't care who does it
but you really need to...
-Alicia, she's great. She's...

968
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,213
- Okay.

969
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,427
<i> No, don't.</i>

970
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,797
I feel good.
   I feel great about it too.

971
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,499
   I'm a little hungover,
   so I'm just gonna get the...

972
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,267
   -You're hungover? Perfect.
   -Get the shakes out.

973
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,369
What were you doing?

974
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,571
       Just, I don't know,
       I don't remember much.
       I was at somebody's house
       or something.

975
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:32,708
But do you want me
     to walk you through it
     as I'm doing it,

976
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,176
- or just do it?
-      -No, just do it.

977
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,911
       Okay, it's gonna take
       a couple of deep breaths.

978
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:38,347
Should we do that together?
     -Yeah, okay.

979
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,681
Okay.

980
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,453
- How many times  have you done this?
-   -Plenty.

981
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:46,989
Plenty?
     Well, like on cadavers     or something?

982
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:49,458
No, no. I got it.
   I'm just not usually
   in my bathroom.

983
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,493
- Don't make it a thing.
- No, no. It's not a thing.

984
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:54,363
This is gonna be    really easy.
    It's just your face.

985
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,899
      What have you
      been getting up to?

986
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,168
     -My mom was here
     until a couple of days ago.
     -Your mom?

987
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,871
Hold still, please.

988
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,108
Right,
     this cotton's itching
     on my face.

989
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,578
Why did your mom come?
Are your parents still together?

990
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,813
              No, no. Are yours?

991
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,081
     No.

992
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,753
         You know, it's funny.
         I actually feel like...

993
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:24,426
This weird thing with my friends
when their parents
are together, like...

994
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:27,296
       -You can't relate.
       -Yeah, I guess.

995
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:31,800
It's almost like I feel
like they're inherently more
naive than me or something.

996
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:35,237
   Not like in a judgy way,
   just like...

997
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,673
   If it hasn't happened
   to your parents, you don't...

998
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,709
     You don't really understand
     that it can happen to you
     or something.

999
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,611
Mmm.

1000
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:44,646
Just not like
     taking it for granted.

1001
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,182
- Can you please     hold still?
-      -I'm trying.

1002
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,951
- But...
-         -Okay,        get comfortable.

1003
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,686
    It's in your fucking face
    right now, so if you want...

1004
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:54,923
 -I'm getting comfortable,
 but this...
 -I want a break anyway, okay.

1005
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,925
The toilet is more
uncomfortable
than that needle.

1006
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,529
        -Okay, okay.
        -Okay, I'm good.

1007
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,831
 -You ready to start again?
 -Yeah, I'm ready.

1008
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,067
- Okay.
-          -Okay.

1009
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:07,836
I'm so grateful   for this, by the way.
   Did I tell you that already?

1010
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,871
        -Yeah, you did.
        -Okay, good.

1011
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,440
               You might not be
               when you see it.

1012
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,709
    -Really? Can you please
    make it look good?
    -Please just stay still.

1013
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,243
I need one of those
sexy scars.

1014
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:21,149
- So you have to
    come back and see me
    in seven to ten days...
    -Okay.

1015
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:25,020
     -...so I can take out
     the stitches.
     -Okay.

1016
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,256
Lee, how are you?

1017
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,158
         Good. Hungry.

1018
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,761
Hungry?

1019
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,963
      Yeah, I'm starving.

1020
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,365
- You have anything?
-    -No.

1021
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,000
We'll go get something.

1022
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,742
- <i> Can't find your...</i>
-  -<i> One week.</i>

1023
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:49,244
   -It was nice to meet you.
   -You too.

1024
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,545
Sorry I didn't have
any food.

1025
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,316
Okay.

1026
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,086
           All right.

1027
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,227
                Fingers crossed.

1028
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,370
              Hah!

1029
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,604
No, don't shoot!

1030
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,724
                             No!

1031
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,727
Shit! Shit!

1032
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,100
              No!

1033
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,174
How do you like
your steak?

1034
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,477
                    Medium well.

1035
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:31,146
         Medium well.
         Medium well.

1036
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,843
So I go on
        in what turns out to be
        a bit of a boys' trip.

1037
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:06,114
  I was thinking
  it was the last thing I need,
  but I end up on
  this big boy's trip and...

1038
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,317
Meaning that you were
going to get all drunk
and everything.

1039
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,087
    -We would get all drunk
    and get into all sorts
    of trouble.
    -This is really good.

1040
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,823
            Is it?
            It's not overcooked?

1041
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,258
It's perfect.

1042
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:57,265
I think I have an easier time
with spiritual desire
than earthly desire.

1043
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,533
Is that possible?

1044
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,104
   -Yeah, of course.
   -That I'm more comfortable...

1045
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,407
     -With earthly desire,
     with spiritual desire--
     -No.

1046
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,276
             Yeah, of course.
             Well, you would be
             because that's what
             we aspire to.

1047
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:12,080
    The earthly desires lead to
    spiritual desires hopefully.

1048
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,416
    -You can start--
    -But I think I'm trying
    to bypass it.

1049
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:17,919
     -Do you?
     -Yeah, I think I try
     to not experience...

1050
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,754
              I think you should
              experience them.

1051
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:22,624
Like, I think my appetite
is so ravenous.

1052
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:23,758
                         Mm-hmm.

1053
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,460
         -Why?
         -I love that.

1054
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:31,867
Oh. I think it is that maybe
I think it might, like,
overwhelm the system.

1055
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:36,571
Your appetite is so ravenous.
Well, it was certainly
the way you attacked that steak.

1056
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,306
Well, it was a big steak.

1057
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,092
<i> Boy, she is</i>
<i>a beautiful girl.</i>

1058
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:59,261
<i>You gonna smack</i>
<i>that hippy ass?</i>

1059
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,829
       Hey, what are you
       doing here?

1060
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:03,698
Hey, dude, she's fine,
fine as wine.

1061
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,333
               Get out of here.
               Come here.

1062
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,334
        Hey, get out
        of town.

1063
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:09,204
- Get out of here.
-     -Hey! Get high.

1064
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,172
 -Where are you going? Come on.
 -Oh, no.

1065
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,742
   Okay, hey, I'm gonna go...
   Max, one sec, come back.

1066
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,310
I might crash out
    on that hammock.

1067
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:18,513
Find me      in a couple of hours.
      The hammock's perfect.

1068
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,148
- Max.
          -Yes.

1069
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,285
    -Please do not tell me
    you're leaving.
    -Yeah.

1070
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,754
          This has been nice.
          We are having a blast.

1071
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,690
                Hey, Tim,
                what's going on?
                Hey! Hey!

1072
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:30,959
  I'll just have one beer
  and I'll get out of your hair.

1073
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,895
 -Hey, I'm gonna get
 rid of him.
 -You look great in that dress.

1074
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:35,530
         -What?
         -I'm gonna get
         rid of him.

1075
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:37,132
      -It's not about him.
      -Then we can
      keep hanging.

1076
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,400
   -It's not even about him.
   -I know.

1077
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,201
<i> That felt like</i>
<i>an accusation of sorts.</i>

1078
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:43,738
           No, why are you here?
           Where's Tim?
           What's he doing?

1079
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,175
Um... Hopefully,
he's doing our taxes.

1080
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,947
I don't know what he's doing.
Probably has some guys over.

1081
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,349
Eating pizza, drinking beers.

1082
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:57,185
We're house-sitting in
this amazing house.
He may be swimming in the pool.

1083
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,087
<i> Well, hey,</i>
<i>if you're really gonna go,</i>

1084
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,122
do you mind if I get
the dress back?

1085
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,891
                  But she looks
                  great in it.

1086
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:05,493
  -I know, you look beautiful,
  I just need it back.
  -Thank you.

1087
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,928
     Can I just wear it for
     one more night?

1088
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,765
No, obviously, you know,
my wife will be here.

1089
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,667
That would be
tough to explain.

1090
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:15,603
I don't... Honestly,
I don't even wanna deal with it,
you know what I mean?

1091
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,305
              Oh, yeah.

1092
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,141
<i> Like, I'm really</i>
    <i> nervous right now.</i>

1093
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,811
Like, just talking
on the subject,
and I don't even know you.

1094
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,980
 -I have that effect on people.
 -And I'll never
 see you again.

1095
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,414
            -Really?
            -Yeah.

1096
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,616
-Oh, you're so sure?
-I've already committed to that.

1097
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,285
Ray, why did you do that?

1098
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,387
     I was just trying
     to help you out, man.
     Did I embarrass you?

1099
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,155
It's a fucking
dick move, man.

1100
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,257
Sorry, was it?
You're showing off
in front of the broad?

1101
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:39,361
           I wasn't showing off.
           We were having fun.
           It was kind of
           a dick move, dude.

1102
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:41,896
      It's, like, funny
      when Tango was here.
      It wasn't funny right now.

1103
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:46,868
     Sometimes you gotta know
     when to not do the fucking,
     you know, Ray Show.

1104
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,636
    -That's very liberating.
    -What?

1105
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,238
    Well, we're never gonna see
    each other again.

1106
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,140
      -It is, right?
      -Yeah, I love that.

1107
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,075
                         Mm-hmm.

1108
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,610
             That I can embrace.

1109
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:56,778
<i> Good night.</i>

1110
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,613
    Goodbye, Mrs. Ray.

1111
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,817
What's that from?

1112
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,254
            How much
            do I have to pay you
            to please leave
            my fucking house?

1113
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,323
A lot of money.

1114
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,892
I love you, man.
I just wanna hang out, dude.

1115
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,727
I just wanna hang out,
come on.

1116
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,030
Come on, bro.

1117
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,432
             Oh, my-fucking-God.

1118
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:21,436
What's wrong?
What, are you uptight?
What do you got
over there, taxes?

1119
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:24,105
  -You gotta decide whether--
  -Shut up, Ray!

1120
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:26,641
Shut up? No!
I'm not gonna shut up!

1121
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,644
You shut up!
Fuck you, man!

1122
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,618
You want me outta here,
I'll get the fuck outta here.

1123
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,685
                       Fuck you.

1124
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,849
I think I know people
that are happy.

1125
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,719
The qualifier of insanely

1126
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:15,723
is the one
that's a little tricky,
you know what I mean?

1127
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,662
     -Just everyday happy.
     -Hmm?

1128
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:23,731
      Just everyday happy,
      forget the "insanely" bit.

1129
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:26,034
          Be consistently happy.

1130
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,368
            Mm-hmm.

1131
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:36,377
  You've thought about it,
  undoubtedly.
  Or dealing with it, unable to.

1132
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,148
              Um...

1133
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,817
Thank you
for a really good night.

1134
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,853
Sorry about your...

1135
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,721
                 Thank you.

1136
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,295
     -You wanna take this
     with you?
     -No.

1137
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,411
              Oh!

1138
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,052
         Huh.

1139
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,733
          Oh, fuck me.

1140
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,562
              Oh.

1141
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:46,287
           Oh, care... Care...
           The tide's coming in.

1142
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:47,822
            -Hey!
            -I know

1143
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:52,360
     Sorry. Come here.
     Do you wanna see something?

1144
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:55,029
    -Yeah.
    -I mean, I know
    I don't know you, but...

1145
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,467
           You gotta...
           Have you seen Saturn?

1146
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:03,237
    Okay, wait, wait.
    Did you ever look through...
    Just don't touch it
    because it's lined up,

1147
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,475
      and just look through the,
      just look through there
      and see what you can see.

1148
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,912
                 Can you see?

1149
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,883
- Oh, my God!
-        -Right?

1150
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,785
   -Yeah.
   -And you can see the rings.

1151
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:18,986
                         I know.

1152
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,190
                Which one is it?

1153
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:26,294
  I know, you can't even see,
  but then you just look
  through there and there it is.

1154
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:28,329
    I mean, this is like...

1155
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,566
Isn't it just
           the most perfect...

1156
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,259
          I think we should get
          a telescope.

1157
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,593
Oh, that could be neat.

1158
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:21,295
            -Right?
            -Yeah.

1159
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,734
I might wanna try
ayahuasca together.

1160
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,836
                   Really?

1161
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,039
           I think we should go
           pick up our child.

1162
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,608
Me too. But can we get
breakfast first,
just the two of us?

1163
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,145
      Oh, yeah,
      let's get breakfast first.
      Let me just text my mom.

1164
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,014
       He'll be okay
       with Grandma and Pop-pop.

1165
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,883
He'll be great.
They'll spoil him.

1166
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,486
Did you guys miss me at all
or did you guys
just had a blast?

1167
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,555
                   No, we did.
                   I missed you.

1168
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,856
       -I missed you too.
       -Oh, yeah.

1169
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,291
I'm not the same
without you guys.

1170
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:54,061
      -Yeah, me neither.
      I've discovered.
      -Good.

1171
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:58,499
           Can we be bad parents
           and let Jude
           watch cartoons?

1172
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,501
--Climb back in bed.

1173
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,570
I think I'm gonna open
a bottle of wine
at about noon.

1174
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,606
                     I love you.

1175
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,041
I love you too.
