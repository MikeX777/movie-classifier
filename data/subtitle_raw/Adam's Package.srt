00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,671
<i>We now return to</i>
Aliens Exist <i>on the History Channel.</i>

3
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:25,308
<i>Personally, I find the thought of alien
life offensive and affront to our Lord.</i>

4
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:29,546
<i>You would, man, because
you've never met alien life.</i>

5
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,617
- <i>I have and... and it's beautiful.</i>
- <i>Huh! This is insane.</i>

6
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,352
<i>This is the truth.</i>

7
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:41,926
<i>They want to unite us.</i>

8
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,796
- <i>They want to show us the way.</i>
- <i>Sir, only God can show us the way.</i>

9
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:47,864
- <i>With God...</i>
- <i>With due respect, sir...</i>

10
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,308
Goddamnit Lulu.

11
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,915
I can't stand this anymore.

12
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,802
- Who is it?
- It's me.

13
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:02,940
Who are you expecting?

14
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,049
Oh, God! Get inside, quick.

15
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,352
- What?
- Hortense!

16
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,425
Dude, you weren't
expecting her, were you?

17
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,427
God no.

18
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,668
Man, that is one scary lady.

19
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,471
Sometimes she stands
at her window and flashes me.

20
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,706
Yeah,
that's got to be memorable.

21
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,076
Like a scene
from a horror movie.

22
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:45,415
- Dude, I brought food, too, you know.
- I know.

23
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,826
Dude, you're going to make it
through this?

24
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,862
Probably not.

25
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,832
- I am so, so, sorry.
- Don't go there.

26
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,669
Three months,
just three more months.

27
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,514
Do you hear that?

28
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,552
- Tell me you can hear that.
- Dude, you're drinking way too much.

29
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:26,824
I know. This divorce bullshit
is driving me crazy.

30
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,527
Plus, being stuck here all day
unable to work.

31
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,931
Shut up, Lulu. I'm in a meeting.

32
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't even hear myself think
with you around.

33
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,539
You got to
get yourself together, man.

34
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:50,146
<i>This just in.</i>

35
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,151
<i>The body of rapper Muhammad Mahad Pappa
was discovered this morning in Hollywood.</i>

36
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:59,623
<i>Los Angeles Police believe Pappa was
a victim of a gangland-style shooting.</i>

37
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:02,725
<i>Pappa's main rival
Spare Change Sniggy</i>

38
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,463
<i>is considered a person of
interest in the investigation.</i>

39
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:08,466
<i>Stay tuned
for more developments.</i>

40
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,444
Up yours, Mongo!

41
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,483
Hey, I told you
my name was Froggy.

42
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,024
Water your garden there,
jailbird.

43
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,845
Hello.

44
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:56,614
Shit, shit, shit.

45
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,019
Hello, Cynthia. Yeah, sorry.

46
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:06,123
No, I was outside.
No, on the property outside.

47
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,759
Shit,
I can't stand this anymore.

48
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,827
Were you able
to get my restrictions modified?

49
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:13,831
Are you serious?

50
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm sick of having to call my probation
officer every time I want to...

51
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,538
Hold on. Someone's at the gate.

52
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,075
<i>Adam. Adam.</i>

53
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,946
Hi, Adam.

54
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,086
Hi.

55
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:39,156
- Eve.
- Eve.

56
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,624
You got to be kidding.

57
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:41,692
Why?

58
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:49,132
You know, Adam.
Eve. Start of things.

59
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,070
Sorry, do we know each other?

60
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:57,807
Yeah, we worked together on that crazy
video shoot last year in New York.

61
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,343
Oh, yeah. Of course.

62
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,980
You're the one
with the little snake tattoo.

63
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:03,913
That's me.

64
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,716
The little snake.

65
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,151
Sometimes.

66
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,355
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- No, no, sorry.

67
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,192
I'm just so surprised
to see you. Come on in.

68
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,133
You're an asshole, Froggy.

69
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,201
Are you talking to me?

70
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,271
No, of course, not.

71
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:30,640
Sometimes
words just pop out of my mouth.

72
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,075
I don't have
any control over it.

73
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,745
Sounds terrible.

74
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:42,685
That's not the half of it.
Stop it, Lulu. I have a guest.

75
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,855
Okay, I think
maybe this was a mistake.

76
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,090
Uh, maybe, I caught you at a bad
time, so, I'm just going to get going.

77
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,993
Oh, no, no.

78
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:52,963
All my temps are bad but now
that you're here, it's better.

79
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,041
I told you my name is Mongo.

80
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,615
Have a seat.

81
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:22,158
So, who's Lulu?

82
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,763
Let's not talk about her.

83
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:36,873
She here?

84
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,013
Not really.

85
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:46,817
How can she not really be here?

86
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,420
It's hard to explain.

87
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,690
And what is that thing
around your ankle?

88
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:54,759
Uh...

89
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,095
Why are you here, anyway?

90
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,864
Hmm?

91
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,667
I have a favor to ask,

92
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,706
but, first, is there anything
left to drink in this place?

93
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,346
- There you go.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:21,918
Cheers to all
of the not reallys in the world!

95
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,459
Oh, my God!
I'm not a beer drinker.

96
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:37,033
Look, I'm sorry but things are a little
complicated for me right now, so...

97
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,034
So?

98
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:41,838
- What's up?
- Oh, the usual.

99
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,473
There's a show
at the Beverly Hilton,

100
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,342
so I stopped by the agency
and they gave me your info.

101
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,379
- They told you I was off the roster?
- That you couldn't work.

102
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,216
Did they tell you why?

103
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,787
No, just that you hadn't worked
in months, so I was concerned.

104
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,288
We hardly know each other.

105
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,356
What does that have to do
with anything?

106
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,326
I can still be concerned about
the well-being of a co-worker.

107
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,762
And you have a favor to ask.

108
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,365
My little sister is a huge fan.

109
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,000
Nice to know.

110
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,937
She has your picture
on her dorm room wall.

111
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,340
- Really?
- Really.

112
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:19,009
- Which one?
- The one.

113
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,945
- The briefs?
- Yeah, the famous briefs.

114
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,046
That did cause a stir.

115
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:31,855
- That was more like an earthquake.
- Hey, what can I say?

116
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:33,857
The world's a funny place.

117
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,826
People get hung up
on the littlest things.

118
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,528
Yeah, I don't think,
that the word little applies here.

119
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:42,065
Hey, it's nothing I can take credit for.
It just happened.

120
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:43,567
Luck of the draw.

121
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,302
I'm not so sure
the word luck applies here.

122
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:49,974
Hey, I've always said, you got to
play the cards that you're dealt.

123
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:53,911
And with that
piece of philosophy,

124
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:57,947
I think we've come back
full circle to what's up?

125
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,586
I thought,
it would surprise her.

126
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:07,057
Uh, you know how young girls are with
their bragging rights and all that stuff.

127
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,226
So, you want a reveal shot?

128
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,395
Just for her.

129
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:16,432
And her friends because without friends
there's no bragging rights, right?

130
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,204
You do realize it'll go around the globe
in an hour. Thanks to social media.

131
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:25,075
No one has to know
that it's you. I mean yours.

132
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:49,966
Adam.

133
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:59,942
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:06,382
Yeah!

135
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:22,031
Stop it!

136
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,343
Shit! Cynthia.

137
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,646
Cynthia, I am so sorry.

138
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,315
I was under the impression that you
actually cared about resolving your issue.

139
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:41,485
I do.

140
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,187
Then why am I standing on the other
side of this gate like a criminal?

141
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:47,257
- I'm sorry, Cynthia.
- Shush! Why didn't you call me back?

142
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,492
As your attorney
I can't help with your situation

143
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,929
if you don't care enough about
your freedom to get back to me.

144
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:56,565
You know I called you every
five seconds for 30 minutes.

145
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,203
And why are you standing
in the rain in a towel?

146
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,139
I fell asleep.

147
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,474
You fell asleep?

148
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:07,110
There's just been a lot going on and...
and my head's been playing tricks on me.

149
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,180
You would think that you would
have had the common courtesy

150
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,383
especially given the fact that
you haven't been able to pay me

151
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,519
for months to at least
not leave me hanging.

152
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,325
Have you got someone up there?

153
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,062
It's probably
from the neighbor's unit.

154
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,730
- Who is that upstairs, Adam?
- A model from my agency.

155
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:30,100
- Oh, it's a model.
- She lives in New York,

156
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,536
but when she comes out west,
she usually stays with Mickey and me.

157
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:35,504
She showed up unexpectedly today.
Her flight from New York got delayed.

158
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:38,709
- Bullshit!
- Seriously, there was bad weather.

159
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:42,211
She was very tired when she arrived,
so she took a nap in the guest bedroom.

160
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,679
She's probably
taking a shower now.

161
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:51,254
How many models
have you got in this place?

162
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:58,361
- Do you know this man?
- No.

163
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,601
- Sorry, ahem, the pepper got to me.
- What are you doing in my house?

164
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:08,237
I'm your wife's therapist

165
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:13,309
and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to
spend the remainder of my life with her.

166
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:15,611
- Nikki?
- I can't live without her.

167
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,780
She's everything
a man could desire in a woman.

168
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:21,184
- That's crazy.
- Who are you?

169
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:27,356
Harry, Harry Balls, Dr. Harry Balls.
Please, don't laugh.

170
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:33,196
I've had enough of people's smirks and
snide chuckles and giggles my entire life.

171
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:34,698
Wow!

172
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,402
Uh, well, Dr. Balls,
before I call the police,

173
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,669
why don't you tell us
what you're doing here?

174
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:43,472
- I... Uh...
- Nine, one...

175
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,041
- I'm planting evidence.
- Evidence?

176
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,209
What kind of evidence?

177
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:51,480
- A gun.
- Why would you do that?

178
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,316
To get you arrested.

179
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:55,585
I want you out of Nikki's life.

180
00:14:55,618 --> 00:15:03,126
The idea of you in her bed slobbering
all over her delicious body.

181
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,294
Dr. Balls, you need help.

182
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,064
So I planted the gun
to frame you.

183
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:10,500
Wait, what gun?

184
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:14,837
The weapon used to kill Muhammad
Mahad Pappa, the Muslim rapper.

185
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,442
- You shot Muhammad Mahad Pappa?
- No, of course, not.

186
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:22,079
I purchased the gun from his
rival, Spare Change Sniggy.

187
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,214
- You bought the gun from Sniggy?
- Oh, no, not directly.

188
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:26,450
Where is it?

189
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,352
In the drawer there.

190
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:36,626
Whoa!

191
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:38,796
Don't touch it.

192
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh, we have company.

193
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,839
Oh, I see the princess
has recovered from her nap.

194
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:50,473
Princess?

195
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:53,309
Uh, Eve, this is my attorney,
Cynthia Morgan.

196
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,111
I told her how you just flew in
from New York

197
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,346
but were delayed
due to bad weather.

198
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,549
Oh, yeah. I got in late.

199
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,489
Apparently, so did Adam,
but just in time to witness a felony.

200
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:07,691
What?

201
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:10,894
We caught this man planting a gun in
an attempt to frame Adam for murder.

202
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,729
Oh, my God!

203
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,899
I'm Harry... Harry Balls.

204
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,701
- Dr. Balls?
- Yes.

205
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:21,270
The sex therapist
from Beverly Hills.

206
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:24,573
Well, sex therapy is only
one aspect of my practice.

207
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:28,477
Ugh, Eve Kane,
I met with you last year.

208
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,216
Of course, the model with the recurring
fantasy of having sex with an alien.

209
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,289
Uh, that was supposed to be
privileged information, Doctor.

210
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:43,659
- But under the circumstances...
- What circumstances?

211
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:50,667
I have never witnessed such an
utterly satisfying sexual experience

212
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,735
like the one
you two had earlier.

213
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,303
You witnessed?

214
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,672
- How?
- Such stamina.

215
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:58,508
So, that's why
you're wearing my bathrobe?

216
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,510
Adam told me it belonged
to his soon-to-be ex.

217
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,212
You fucked him
and I can still smell it on you.

218
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,583
How can that be?
I just showered.

219
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:10,819
You lying bastard.
She's no model from New York.

220
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:13,222
Yes, I am. Upper West Side.

221
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,860
- Get yourself a new lawyer, slime ball.
- What about my petition?

222
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,929
Oh, here's to your petition!

223
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:22,199
Yeah, you can keep that ankle
bracelet on forever for all I care.

224
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,233
I'm done with you.

225
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,336
In fact, I'll petition the court
for an extension for bad behavior.

226
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,807
And you can keep the robe, slut.

227
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,546
She just called me a slut.

228
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:39,382
Don't worry about her.
She's upset.

229
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:41,918
Huh, I just messed up
your whole situation.

230
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,753
It was worth it.

231
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:49,393
Based on my observations,
I have to agree.

232
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:52,962
Shut up.

233
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,601
<i>DA's office.</i>

234
00:17:57,634 --> 00:18:00,569
I've got a lead on the
Muhammad Mahad Pappa murder.

235
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,517
- Hey.
- Hey.

236
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,885
Sorry,
but I got to get back to town.

237
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,457
I have a really early shoot tomorrow and
then I'm off to Paris for a few days.

238
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,424
I understand. I'll see you out.

239
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,862
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you again, Eve.

240
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,397
Thanks, Doctor.

241
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:32,936
I hope that you two are able to work
out your... Shall we call them problems?

242
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:36,405
Oh, and I really like
your little snake.

243
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,975
What'd you think of the big one?

244
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,746
Awesome. Really, awesome.

245
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:43,779
Okay, let's go.

246
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,363
- Thank you.
- Pleasure was all mine.

247
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:05,434
As for the photo, you have made me
the hero in at least one girl's room.

248
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,504
Keep your identity secret,

249
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:10,406
otherwise you might find
yourself famous around the globe

250
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,509
and for more than
just your modeling.

251
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,842
You are an egomaniac.

252
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:22,953
Come back.

253
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,692
You couldn't keep me away.

254
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,802
- Go.
- I'll be back.

255
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:41,770
Okay, Arnold.

256
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:44,807
I'll be waiting.

257
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,449
I hate it when you do that.

258
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:58,621
That thing you do with your
tongue every time I'm making out.

259
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:02,326
- You talking to me?
- No, I'm not talking to you.

260
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:07,563
What's wrong?

261
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,000
- I lied.
- What do you mean?

262
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,671
I was supposed to kill you.

263
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:16,505
What?

264
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,009
Shoot you through the head,
put a gun in your hand...

265
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,044
Make it look like a suicide.

266
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,879
Yeah.

267
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,015
I just couldn't do it.

268
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:28,751
- Because the doorbell rang?
- No. It's...

269
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,722
Now, she's never going
to let me back into her life.

270
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,959
And that's what's bothering you?

271
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:39,095
What about me?
I could be dead right now.

272
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:41,464
I could never have
actually killed you.

273
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:47,604
She had me under her spell,
hypnotized by her allure.

274
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,774
Her smell alone
would drive me crazy.

275
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,378
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:03,619
Look, Harry, trust me,
you were never in her life.

277
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,026
- Why would she want me dead?
- For the insurance.

278
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:12,828
What insurance?

279
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:14,864
The five-million-dollar policy.

280
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:17,533
But that wouldn't pay
in the event of a suicide.

281
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,503
It would after three years
and yesterday was three years.

282
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:25,575
- The bitch!
- Yeah, I know. It's terrible.

283
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:29,511
She told me we'd run off
together to the South Pacific,

284
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:32,715
lay on the beach,
eat fruit from the trees.

285
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,652
- You would have ended up dead, too.
- You think?

286
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,756
Ugh, how could
I have been so stupid?

287
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:42,992
That's what happens when you let your
little head do your thinking for you.

288
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,764
You need to
get yourself together.

289
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,000
We need to figure out
what to do.

290
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,206
What's the matter?

291
00:21:58,773 --> 00:21:59,808
Nothing.

292
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,551
We have to work something out.

293
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,854
Why are you talking
with your back to me?

294
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:18,662
- This is not working for me.
- For me, either.

295
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,007
I can't stand this anymore,
Lulu.

296
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,242
- Who's Lulu?
- A goddamn ghost.

297
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:34,911
A ghost?

298
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:37,046
Yeah, she was murdered upstairs
before I moved in.

299
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:38,615
- Murdered?
- Yes.

300
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,016
- Upstairs?
- Upstairs. She sings to me.

301
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,952
- Sings to you?
- She was a rising opera star.

302
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:46,689
- Opera?
- Yeah, opera.

303
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:51,126
- Drives me crazy and she knows it.
- She does?

304
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,098
Her spirit has never left.
It's like she enjoys taunting me.

305
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:59,636
She pops up at the most inopportune
times like when I'm in bed with someone.

306
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,140
She smiles at me, flashes her boobs,
does sick things with her tongue.

307
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:09,211
- Sounds terrible.
- Yeah, she's a real pain in the ass.

308
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:27,596
I got a plan. A brilliant plan.

309
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:32,201
<i>Hide this
and do exactly as I tell you.</i>

310
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:35,170
<i>No distractions. Understood?</i>

311
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:50,218
Look, you don't have to keep
supplying me with groceries.

312
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:52,888
- If not me, then who?
- That's not the point.

313
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:56,225
That's exactly the point.
You don't have any money.

314
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:58,961
You can't leave. All you have is
that opera singer.

315
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:00,596
Stop it.

316
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,365
I think, that'll cause
severe weight loss,

317
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:08,571
so, tonight you're having food
with the alcohol and I'm cooking.

318
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:13,175
So, I'm standing there
with Cynthia who was pissed

319
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:17,180
because I didn't call her back, talking
to this guy that Nikki sent to kill me...

320
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,014
Whoa, what?

321
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:22,652
And Eve comes walking into
the room towel drying her hair.

322
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:24,186
Who's Eve?

323
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,057
A goddess and she's wearing
Cynthia's bathrobe.

324
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,127
- Oh-oh!
- No shit, oh-oh.

325
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:34,631
You know, I... Hold on.

326
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:39,035
I thought you might be lonely
all by yourself.

327
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:42,939
I guess now,
you won't be needing this.

328
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:50,412
This my friend, is an authentic
Sasha Grey Deep Throat stroker.

329
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:51,981
Yes!

330
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:56,719
- Good God!
- Good God is right.

331
00:24:56,751 --> 00:25:02,325
It comes with a screaming vibrating
cock ring and organic lubricant.

332
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:03,359
Yeah.

333
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:07,962
But since you have your goddess,
you won't be needing this. Give me that.

334
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,437
What I need is
to get out of here.

335
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,973
I told you, I spoke to some
brothers and, uh, there's a guy.

336
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,409
It's too risky.

337
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:21,443
Next step after being locked up

338
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:23,346
here in my own place is being
locked up in a place with bars

339
00:25:23,378 --> 00:25:25,347
and you visiting me on Sundays.

340
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:29,317
I can do Saturdays too,
depending on how far away they send you.

341
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:32,956
I need my life back
and I need a new attorney.

342
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:36,158
I'll do what I can.

343
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:38,161
- Do you want to know what you can do?
- Of course, I do.

344
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:41,096
Stop feeling guilty.

345
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,399
And how exactly
do you expect me to do that?

346
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,168
Just do it.

347
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,969
You didn't slip that package
in my bag to hurt me.

348
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,238
You know I didn't.

349
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,972
You did it 'cause you thought I'd come
across the border without a hitch.

350
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:53,342
- Yeah, you were white.
- Still I am.

351
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,211
- Such a known face.
- Somewhat known.

352
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:58,480
- It should have been easy.
- And you needed the money.

353
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,348
Fucking desperately.

354
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:03,052
It's not a hard thing, it's a...
it's a... it's ecstasy, man.

355
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,921
It's a feel-good thing.

356
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:06,455
You know, they're even thinking
about like legalizing it now.

357
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,825
It's over.

358
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:11,694
You're still my best friend,
so start acting like it never happened.

359
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:15,765
This ain't right, man.

360
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:18,800
What ain't right?

361
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,203
You acting like Mother Teresa

362
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:26,242
instead of some guy whose life has been
turned upside down over something I did.

363
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:28,745
Something selfish and stupid.

364
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:33,950
It's all good, man.

365
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:36,820
Everything happens for a reason.

366
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,130
Ta-da!

367
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:51,735
Thanks for not singing.

368
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:55,804
What about it?

369
00:26:57,972 --> 00:26:59,108
Oh!

370
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,284
Cool.

371
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:09,384
Jesus!

372
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:17,860
Who could that be?

373
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,336
Can I help you?

374
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:30,006
I'm Watson.
This is Officer Hopkins.

375
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,442
It's the middle of the night.

376
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,979
- What could I do for you?
- Can we come in?

377
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:39,214
I would prefer
you come back during the day.

378
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:43,119
It would be best if you let us in.
It'll only take a minute.

379
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:50,894
- I'm not in any more trouble, am I?
- We're not sure yet.

380
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:02,404
Come in.

381
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,278
We received an anonymous tip.

382
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:13,215
- About a gun?
- And drugs.

383
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:16,352
Something I understand
you have some experience with.

384
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:19,288
Hey, I don't use this stuff,
never have.

385
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:23,960
Beer drinker myself I prefer
getting high the old-fashioned way.

386
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,300
I could care less.

387
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:35,904
You know that tip probably came
from my ex-attorney.

388
00:28:35,938 --> 00:28:37,373
We had an argument.

389
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:40,076
This is obviously her way
of getting back at me.

390
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:42,044
You don't mind
if we look around, do you?

391
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:45,381
Go ahead. Look all you want.

392
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,430
So, you're working late.

393
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:28,524
Can I offer you a beer?

394
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:51,681
I could make you guys some peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches.

395
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:24,346
What's this?

396
00:30:25,713 --> 00:30:27,450
It's not a gun.

397
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:30,286
Don't be a smartass.
We can plant one if you prefer.

398
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:34,590
It's a novel, my first.

399
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,492
I can't leave the house.
I can't work.

400
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:41,263
I have a lot of time on my hands,
so I started dabbling in writing.

401
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:45,168
What's this title, "Truth of X?"

402
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:49,205
One of my hobbies is collecting
info on UFOs.

403
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,039
I thought,
it would make for a good story.

404
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:53,642
Really?

405
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,243
You believe in that shit?

406
00:30:57,112 --> 00:30:59,048
It's hard to say.

407
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,250
There's some evidence that we're
not alone and haven't been.

408
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:06,355
I mean it just seems to make sense that
we're not the beginning and the end.

409
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:09,491
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me give you some advice,

410
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:13,696
you should go to church instead of
filling your head with that nonsense.

411
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:18,034
Yeah, I really wish I could,
but, uh, I can't.

412
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:23,471
You're a smartass and a felon.

413
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:27,276
The federal government is not an
organization you want to mess with.

414
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,779
Believe me, prison would be
the least of your concerns.

415
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:33,782
I'd be careful if I were you.

416
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:38,721
Yeah, on that note,
we're done here.

417
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,625
Be careful.

418
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:48,663
Just keep saying that to yourself
over and over again, careful.

419
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:51,166
Careful. Careful.

420
00:31:57,806 --> 00:31:59,075
Careful.

421
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:22,698
I'ma see what you got, big boy.

422
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:33,275
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

423
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:35,510
Whoo, ah!

424
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:38,514
Whoo, whoo, he-haw!

425
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:49,325
<i>In your time of need,
I'm glad you reached out for Harry Balls.</i>

426
00:32:49,357 --> 00:32:52,327
<i>Sorry that I missed your call.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

427
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:55,764
I'll say you're sorry.
You're a sorry son of a bitch.

428
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:56,699
Where are you?

429
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:05,540
I've been trying to reach your
sorry ass for the last two hours.

430
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:08,410
Is that loser dead yet?
He better be.

431
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:11,580
Oh, this is Nikki by the way.
Call me back.

432
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,428
Coming.

433
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:28,564
Hold on.

434
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,368
What's your hurry?

435
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,639
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

436
00:33:36,672 --> 00:33:38,274
<i>Hey, Adam.</i>

437
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,342
<i>Eve, what are you...?</i>

438
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,584
- I thought...
- I canceled.

439
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:50,886
Paris?

440
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:54,523
Paris, everything.

441
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:57,360
I couldn't stop
thinking about you, about...

442
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,628
Me too.

443
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,932
I laid in bed tossing
and turning.

444
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,938
<i>Oh, Adam! Adam.</i>

445
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,384
What's that?

446
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:24,286
My obsession.

447
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:29,591
Or should I say
my other obsession.

448
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,427
I do love flattery.

449
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:34,529
And this?

450
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,802
I have a passion
for things extraterrestrial.

451
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:41,903
So do I.

452
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:47,442
But then again, you know that thanks
to the good doctor's big mouth.

453
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,580
So, we really do have
a lot in common.

454
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,349
Curious.

455
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:56,818
Scary.

456
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:02,557
What's wrong?

457
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,264
What?

458
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,269
- It's a long story.
- Tell me.

459
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:19,474
But first, coffee, food.

460
00:35:19,507 --> 00:35:21,276
I'm drained.

461
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,580
You're not the only one
who's drained.

462
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:30,285
This townhouse
has a tragic history.

463
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,454
How so?

464
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:36,592
It's haunted.

465
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:39,695
You got to be kidding.

466
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:40,762
No, really.

467
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:44,000
There's an annoying ghost
who lives here.

468
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:48,604
So cool.

469
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:52,875
- You can see her now, can't you?
- Yes.

470
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,712
She was murdered here.

471
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,983
The previous owner
of this house was a scientist

472
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:05,420
<i>involved in highly classified
work with the government.</i>

473
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,789
He and Lulu were lovers.

474
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:14,963
Ah! What the hell.

475
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:26,474
She's very talented.

476
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:29,411
An opera singer.

477
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,646
She sings to me.

478
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:34,750
What happened?

479
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:39,954
One day they were assassinated
in the bedroom upstairs.

480
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,559
I didn't know any of this when
I bought the place and then...

481
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:46,662
- Don't they have to disclose that?
- I guess not.

482
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:49,498
He didn't have any heirs.

483
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:55,903
I bought it from the court,
complete with all this furniture and stuff.

484
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,373
Including Lulu.

485
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:01,476
Yeah, including Lulu.

486
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:10,518
One day I was in the
storage room downstairs

487
00:37:10,552 --> 00:37:12,488
trying to
get myself organized...

488
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:18,660
when I looked up and saw this door that
I quite honestly hadn't noticed before.

489
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:22,064
Curious, I went to it...

490
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:28,469
and when I opened it,
I was shocked to see...

491
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:29,638
Lulu.

492
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,076
I thought, I was going to have
a heart attack.

493
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,847
I can't even imagine
what that must have been like.

494
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:42,117
- That wasn't all.
- What do you mean?

495
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,888
She wanted me to follow her
under the house.

496
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:50,893
She pointed at a light,
a glow off in the corner.

497
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,533
She was leading me towards something,
watching from the other side of the room.

498
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:03,773
I navigated in the darkness
without knowing why.

499
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,476
It was as if I didn't have
any control over my actions.

500
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,414
What was it,
the glow in the corner?

501
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:18,987
A package, it came from the lab
where the previous owner was working.

502
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:25,427
I glanced over at Lulu
looking for answers.

503
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:28,764
And then she was gone.

504
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:34,603
Just like now.

505
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,208
What was in the package?

506
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:45,481
- Documents.
- Documents?

507
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:51,586
Top secret documents giving details of
the examination of an alien spacecraft.

508
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,954
What?

509
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:56,491
And, look,
I shouldn't be telling you this.

510
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,793
- Why?
- Because it might put you in danger.

511
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:02,030
I believe it was the motive
behind the murders.

512
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:06,035
I don't care. I want to know.

513
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:12,139
- There was information on a treaty.
- A treaty?

514
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,175
Signed by President Eisenhower.

515
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,243
Between who?

516
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:19,048
- The United States and...
- And who?

517
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:22,117
Aliens.

518
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,652
I fucking knew it.

519
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:29,692
Give me a sec.

520
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:39,867
- Hello.
- <i>Adam, it's me Harry.</i>

521
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,669
What's the matter, Harry?

522
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,972
- I didn't get very far.
- <i>Why? What happened?</i>

523
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,677
I was abducted and raped
by the most marvelous woman.

524
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,013
You were abducted and raped?

525
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:56,818
<i>Yes, and it was everything
a good rape fantasy should be.</i>

526
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,954
Harry, you are so sick!

527
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:01,088
Seriously, Adam,

528
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,692
it... it was far more satisfying
than anything I ever had with Nikki.

529
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,797
For the last time, Harry,
you never had anything with Nikki.

530
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,867
<i>Who raped you?</i>

531
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,005
- Your neighbor, Hortense Bailey.
- My God!

532
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:20,675
You're telling me the big bush Bailey
raped you and that you enjoyed it?

533
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,679
I got off like a Roman candle.

534
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:26,981
- Oh, Jesus!
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

535
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:28,750
<i>Oh, that feels so good.</i>

536
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:39,994
Give me a break, Lulu.
What about the plan?

537
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:42,630
Adam, I want to thank you.

538
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:44,700
I am a changed man now.

539
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:51,340
Harry, the plan? What about the plan?
I can't hear a damn thing, Lulu.

540
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,777
I'm sorry to yell at you.

541
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:59,748
I realize you're terribly lonely,
but please work with me, here.

542
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,020
<i>Adam. Adam.</i>

543
00:41:06,054 --> 00:41:08,824
- Yeah, Harry?
- <i>Is that Lulu again?</i>

544
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:11,860
Don't worry yourself about that
now just deal with the plan.

545
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:15,230
Don't worry about it.
I've got it covered.

546
00:41:15,262 --> 00:41:18,232
<i>The plan is happening.</i>

547
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:27,174
I heard the bell.

548
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,744
Could've waited
till I got to you.

549
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,747
Why?

550
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,853
Because it's my house and you don't know,
what or who you might be walking in on.

551
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,222
I got very little sleep.

552
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:43,225
Mm.

553
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,327
Eve came back for a visit.

554
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,797
Bro, you still living
in that fantasy world?

555
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:55,870
Look this sweet thing
is calling you and it's real.

556
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,007
What's real?

557
00:41:59,907 --> 00:42:00,875
Ooh!

558
00:42:04,378 --> 00:42:06,380
- Yum.
- Yeah.

559
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:08,016
Hi. I'm Eve.

560
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:11,052
- Um, hi, I'm, uh...
- What's that?

561
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,722
Uh, a stupid toy.

562
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:17,025
It looks ghastly.
What do you do with it?

563
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:21,096
This is Rob. Rob's a skeptic.

564
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:24,098
He thinks people like me are delusional
and have trouble telling the truth.

565
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:26,201
What he means to say is,
"Hi, I'm Rob,

566
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:30,806
his best friend and also responsible
for his current circumstance."

567
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,909
- That's enough, best friend.
- Hi, Rob.

568
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:37,379
So, would you
like to tell me more

569
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:40,448
about Adam's
current circumstance?

570
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,152
Do you know,
it's a pleasure to meet you?

571
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:47,255
- Adam has told me so much about you.
- He has?

572
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:50,157
- None of which he believed.
- That's not my fault.

573
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,459
That's not my fault.

574
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,161
- Has he told you about Lulu?
- Yeah.

575
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,831
Yeah, so you can understand
why I'm skeptical.

576
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,898
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

577
00:42:57,931 --> 00:42:59,467
- I'm real.
- Yeah, all right.

578
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:01,804
So, hmm.

579
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:06,307
<i>It's time I tell you
both about the plan.</i>

580
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:13,481
Harry, you son of a bitch!
Where have you been?

581
00:43:13,514 --> 00:43:15,483
I've been trying you non-stop.

582
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:17,518
- <i>I can't explain at all...</i>
- Shut up!

583
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:21,222
- Did you do it? Is it done?
- <i>Yes.</i>

584
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:24,158
<i>I shot him in the head.
It's like you said...</i>

585
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,228
Fantastic.

586
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,197
- Harry, you're the best.
- <i>It was awful.</i>

587
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,300
- <i>Blood was everywhere.</i>
- Oh, wonderful!

588
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,370
I can't tell you
how happy you've made me

589
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:41,009
and what a big surprise I have in store
for you the next time we're together.

590
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:54,456
- Hello.
- <i>It's Harry. I told her.</i>

591
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:57,992
- So?
- <i>Exactly what you said.</i>

592
00:43:58,025 --> 00:43:59,393
And?

593
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:00,896
<i>She's on her way.</i>

594
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,099
We don't have much time.

595
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:16,144
Heads up. She's here.

596
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,585
Adam.

597
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:00,923
Yes!

598
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:11,967
You brought this on yourself,
you know.

599
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:17,873
Did you really think I would stand for
you not making good on your promise?

600
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:21,175
The deal was never
that I would go wanting.

601
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:27,282
You're stuck here, broke,
because of stupidity.

602
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:30,384
What was I supposed to do?

603
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:34,021
Work?

604
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:38,460
It's a good thing I had the foresight to
protect myself with that insurance policy.

605
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:44,266
Now at least, you'll be able to
support my needs like you promised,

606
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:46,201
and for that I thank you.

607
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:51,239
I've always appreciated
a man of his word.

608
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,147
Good job. Good on you.

609
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:27,942
I loved her.

610
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:34,650
She was afraid of everything,
even life itself.

611
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:39,521
She thought it might be
the answer, but...

612
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:45,593
she could never find joy,
no matter what.

613
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:50,398
It was always just out of reach.

614
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:58,941
She's cursed
and I weep for her...

615
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:02,311
and...

616
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:06,047
I forgive her.

617
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:10,452
That ass though.

618
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:18,158
- <i>Hey, guys.</i>
- Did she buy it?

619
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:19,161
<i>Sure did.</i>

620
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:24,432
<i>Thank you, Harry.</i>

621
00:47:24,465 --> 00:47:27,568
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Oh, I can't thank you enough.

622
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:29,670
Finally, I can relax.

623
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:32,073
It's like the tensions
have been lifted

624
00:47:32,106 --> 00:47:37,245
and I feel like my old self again
for the first time in a long time.

625
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:40,214
<i>I can only imagine.
It's been what, three months?</i>

626
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:42,583
Watch the sarcasm, Harry.

627
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:45,553
Don't turn this joyous moment
into shit for me.

628
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:50,157
- <i>Sorry. You know I'd do anything for you.</i>
- That's better.

629
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,694
You do want to stay on
my good side, don't you, Harry?

630
00:47:53,728 --> 00:47:56,697
- My giving side.
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

631
00:47:56,731 --> 00:47:58,433
Okay.

632
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:01,368
Okay, here's what I want
you to do. Find a pay phone.

633
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:03,304
Call the police
and tell them you heard

634
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:08,208
what sounded like a gunshot
coming from Adam's townhouse.

635
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:11,479
- Can you do that for me, Harry?
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

636
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:13,581
<i>Will you call me as soon
as you think it's safe?</i>

637
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,117
I will.

638
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:22,157
It won't be long and we'll be off to
start our new life together in Tahiti.

639
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,191
Yes!

640
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:25,160
<i>I can't wait to see...</i>

641
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:38,639
This is impressive
and I love the title.

642
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,382
In order for us to continue to
have a trusting relationship...

643
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:50,384
Yeah 'cause it's been like what,
24 hours already?

644
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:53,655
- Stay out of this and cook.
- Oh, yes, Sir, yes, Sir!

645
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:54,756
Mr. Adam Sir.

646
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:58,460
As I was saying...

647
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,596
we need to be completely honest
with each other

648
00:49:01,628 --> 00:49:05,699
and I need to know you'll keep
my private life private.

649
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,669
Of course.

650
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:11,573
So no talk about the package
or my aliens?

651
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:14,609
- Your aliens?
- You know what I mean.

652
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,146
It's uncanny.

653
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:22,851
This book is so authentic and real,
the characters, it's as if you knew them.

654
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:35,563
What if I told you that they were
fiction and authentic at the same time?

655
00:49:35,596 --> 00:49:38,333
And what if I told you
that lunch was ready?

656
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:43,371
I wouldn't be surprised.

657
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:55,750
What did he tell you before?

658
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,453
- About?
- About the package.

659
00:50:00,387 --> 00:50:02,623
I saw that.

660
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:06,594
Wha... Adam's package is no secret,
all right? It's known far and wide, so...

661
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:08,762
So, let's forget about it
and eat.

662
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:14,536
I heard what you said before.
I'm your oldest friend, man.

663
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:17,806
I'm your oldest friend and I don't
know anything about any other package.

664
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:20,807
What is it?

665
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,846
More guns, drugs, tell me it's not drugs.
Tell me something.

666
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:29,617
That really pisses me off.

667
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:40,195
- Hello.
- <i>It's Harry. I've got the gun.</i>

668
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:42,396
- <i>I know where the car is.</i>
- Okay.

669
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:20,300
- This needs to be published.
- No way!

670
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,002
- It'll be a bestseller.
- Not interested.

671
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:24,739
- But we could do...
- Look, it's too dangerous.

672
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,307
People have a right to know.

673
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,310
The powers that be are afraid
it'll freak them out,

674
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:31,713
change everything
they believe in.

675
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:34,514
The truth is not negotiable.

676
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:36,984
- I know, but...
- But what?

677
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:40,554
Look, I'm not even a writer.

678
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:42,856
I only did it because I had
nothing else to do.

679
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:44,759
It just sort of wrote itself.

680
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,262
Yeah, but everything happens
for a reason.

681
00:51:48,295 --> 00:51:49,630
I know this publisher.

682
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:51,499
- I think he could...
- No.

683
00:51:51,532 --> 00:51:55,003
You can't just run away from
this like it never happened.

684
00:51:56,936 --> 00:51:58,772
- Stay out of this.
- What?

685
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,778
- Not you.
- She agrees, doesn't she?

686
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,546
Yes.

687
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,448
So this publisher he specializes
in this kind of stuff.

688
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:10,985
Area 51, paranormal,
ghost stories.

689
00:52:11,018 --> 00:52:14,554
- I do know a thing or two about ghosts.
- Let's go see him.

690
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:16,925
I can't, remember.

691
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:23,331
- Tell him to come here.
- He won't.

692
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:26,668
He's in Palm Springs. He's a big shot.
He's not just going to come here.

693
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:29,003
Oh, too bad then.

694
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:30,605
But he needs to meet you
and hear your story.

695
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:34,007
He would love this.
He would do it for sure.

696
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,778
What part of, I'm under house arrest.
Don't you understand?

697
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:39,414
I'm willing to bet
that that's why you're here.

698
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,550
- The bracelet?
- No, here.

699
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:00,367
You guys
are going to get us killed.

700
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,735
One of us is already dead.

701
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:10,110
This homicide?

702
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:12,646
Never mind who I am.

703
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:16,750
Just tell them if they want
the weapon used in the murder

704
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:19,653
of Muhammad Mahad Pappa,

705
00:53:19,686 --> 00:53:24,726
look in the trunk of a car
parked on Fiji Way in the Marina.

706
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:27,996
California license plate 2-4-0.

707
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:40,941
- Hey, Rob.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

708
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:43,777
Um, you know
that guy you told me about?

709
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:46,047
- <i>What guy?</i>
- About the bracelet.

710
00:53:47,648 --> 00:53:49,784
<i>Yeah, you told me
it's too risky. Remember?</i>

711
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:52,519
<i>You know, locked up behind bars,
visiting me on Sundays.</i>

712
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:55,623
Hey, you said you might be able
to come on Saturdays, too.

713
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:58,692
Look, I need 24 hours.
It's important.

714
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:02,929
<i>It's about that package, right?</i>

715
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:06,067
<i>You know that package you won't tell
your best friend anything about.</i>

716
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:09,836
Look, as soon as I get this thing
cleared up, I'll tell you everything.

717
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:12,406
For the moment it's better
that you're in the dark.

718
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,677
It's safer.
So, just leave it at that.

719
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:17,979
I need your help on this.

720
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:22,416
- <i>You sure?</i>
- Yes, I'm sure.

721
00:54:23,451 --> 00:54:24,918
<i>All right. His name is Jesus.</i>

722
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:27,855
- Jesus?
- <i>Yeah, Jesus.</i>

723
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:32,160
- Well, what did he say?
- <i>That it was possible.</i>

724
00:54:32,193 --> 00:54:33,428
What do you think?

725
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:36,530
<i>Well, if he could walk on water</i>

726
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:38,732
<i>then I guess he can get you out
of the ankle bracelet, right?</i>

727
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:43,603
- Funny, very funny.
- <i>I'll call him.</i>

728
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:46,541
<i>Just don't be put off by his appearance.</i>

729
00:54:56,817 --> 00:54:57,818
Oh, boy!

730
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:01,689
Jesus?

731
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:09,596
God blesses you.

732
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:13,233
Cool. Come on in.

733
00:55:27,847 --> 00:55:29,583
Hey.

734
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,820
Hey, back at you.

735
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:37,190
- Is she okay?
- Oh, yeah. A true believer.

736
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:39,026
Hmm.

737
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,163
So, what can Jesus do for you?

738
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:45,732
Can you get me out of this thing
without setting off alarms?

739
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:49,103
Oosh, hmm.

740
00:55:49,135 --> 00:55:54,242
That'll take a miracle,
but I do miracles for a living.

741
00:55:55,675 --> 00:55:59,679
Uh, excuse me for asking,
but who are you?

742
00:55:59,713 --> 00:56:02,950
Oh, I... I'm Jesus,
the son of God.

743
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:04,519
Of course.

744
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:08,256
- God Alvarez is my father.
- You're kidding.

745
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:11,158
- Your father's name is God?
- Exactly.

746
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,994
And since you seemed
so interested in my credentials,

747
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:16,897
I started off as a commercial
fisherman of Catalina.

748
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:19,099
Naturally.

749
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:23,136
But then I followed in on my father's
footsteps and I became a locksmith.

750
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,306
Ah, a natural progression.

751
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,807
We run a small place
on Benny's Boulevard.

752
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,677
It's called the Jesus
and God Locksmith Shop.

753
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,780
- So, a family operation.
- Yes, yes, yes.

754
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:35,282
I have a younger brother
named Moses.

755
00:56:35,315 --> 00:56:37,751
Oh, my God.
This is just too good.

756
00:56:37,784 --> 00:56:41,888
And an older brother named Judah.
We get a lot of west side Jewish business.

757
00:56:41,922 --> 00:56:44,125
I bet.

758
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,927
Sorry for all the questions,
but how do you know about ankle bracelets?

759
00:56:49,096 --> 00:56:53,833
You're not a true believer
and your friend here is a cynic.

760
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:58,172
Oh, now this is not a good environment
for me to do what you need me to do.

761
00:56:58,204 --> 00:57:00,173
Don't take it personally.

762
00:57:00,206 --> 00:57:02,710
- We're just trying to understand.
- I wore one myself for a while.

763
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,210
For what?

764
00:57:04,244 --> 00:57:06,948
Turning water into wine
without a liquor license?

765
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:13,887
You see what I mean? You see what I mean?
What's her profession anyways, huh?

766
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,190
- Beautiful stand-up comedian?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.

767
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:21,662
It was a minor, minor,
smuggling charge.

768
00:57:21,695 --> 00:57:24,765
A lovely herb God
would have smoked himself.

769
00:57:24,797 --> 00:57:28,168
Anyway, it kept me ashore
for enough time

770
00:57:28,202 --> 00:57:35,042
with nothing to do but contemplate on that
bracelet and after a while he came to me.

771
00:57:35,074 --> 00:57:40,114
He whispered in my ear, the kind of
whisper that we all wait and pray for,

772
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:43,250
the one that leads us
to be a novo.

773
00:57:43,282 --> 00:57:46,953
From the TV to the computer,
to the cell phone, to the moon and beyond,

774
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:51,192
let's just say I grew
to understand how it all works.

775
00:57:51,224 --> 00:57:53,027
How?

776
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:56,197
Ah, now that is a miracle
that I referred to earlier.

777
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,333
- And I'm sure it doesn't come cheap.
- Oh, there she goes again.

778
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:01,970
Miracles never do.

779
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,773
So dropping the philosophizing for a
minute, what are we talking about here?

780
00:58:06,806 --> 00:58:09,009
- Cash.
- Yes, how much?

781
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:10,111
How much you got?

782
00:58:11,045 --> 00:58:14,282
The ATM daily limit is $600.

783
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:18,119
I can do that.

784
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:19,052
But...

785
00:58:21,387 --> 00:58:23,257
you need to provide a leg.

786
00:58:24,224 --> 00:58:27,193
- A leg?
- To transfer the bracelet to.

787
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:29,295
A living human leg.

788
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:32,333
Wh... Why does it have to be
a living human leg?

789
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:39,373
Because the bracelet has to be in
contact with living human flesh, yes?

790
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:42,076
Or the device will send out
a default message

791
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:44,377
and your boyfriend's ass
will be grass.

792
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,847
The miracle will be reversed

793
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,284
and your boyfriend will be crucified
and Jesus won't be able to save him.

794
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:53,019
You got it? <i>Si, bueno.</i>

795
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:57,357
Now you have no idea what some
of my clients have come up with.

796
00:58:57,391 --> 00:59:02,262
I've heard suggested everything from using
a pig to a horse to everything in between.

797
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:05,966
Where are we going to find
a living human leg?

798
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:09,903
- I don't know.
- A prayer is always helpful.

799
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:16,110
Harry Balls.

800
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,448
Well, that's a new one.

801
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:25,386
I suppose it could work,
but an ankle is better though.

802
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:36,063
What is this shit about my man
getting a tag on his leg?

803
00:59:36,963 --> 00:59:38,498
He owes me.

804
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:40,267
He tried to set me up
for a crime I didn't commit.

805
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,303
That's not true.
I was supposed to kill you.

806
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:45,972
There, even more to my point.

807
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:48,408
Look, I've apologized.

808
00:59:48,442 --> 00:59:50,777
I'll do whatever I can to help,

809
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,248
but I can't be tied down to this
place like some sort of criminal.

810
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,851
- Harry, it's one day.
- I'm claustrophobic.

811
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,287
I need space, freedom to roam.

812
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,524
The idea of wearing that thing is...
It makes me sick.

813
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:06,826
How do you think the idea of you
coming here to murder me makes me feel?

814
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,230
Murder? Oh, God!

815
01:00:10,931 --> 01:00:13,833
- For real?
- I couldn't do it.

816
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,836
Just the thought
of you coming here to off me.

817
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:18,239
Well, since obviously you guys
have many issues

818
01:00:18,271 --> 01:00:20,173
and can get your shit together,

819
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:22,308
I will be now getting on
with God's work.

820
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:25,445
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That's what you came here to do, so.

821
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:31,251
I'll take your place, honey poo.

822
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,453
Oh, you'd do that for me,
sweet pea?

823
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:39,427
Anything. You're my squeeze, my man.
As long as I'm getting paid.

824
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,329
Okay, what are we talking here?

825
01:00:42,362 --> 01:00:46,500
My services could be calculated
from an hour, day, week.

826
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,168
One day.

827
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:49,904
Perks?

828
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:51,838
- Perks?
- Extras.

829
01:00:51,871 --> 01:00:52,839
Like?

830
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:54,842
Pizza.

831
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:56,476
Oh, my God! All you can eat.

832
01:00:59,278 --> 01:01:01,315
- Porn.
- Oh, Lord.

833
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:06,954
- All that you can handle.
- And 500 big ones under the table.

834
01:01:13,594 --> 01:01:14,796
Deal.

835
01:01:34,414 --> 01:01:36,317
I can never thank you enough
for this.

836
01:01:37,516 --> 01:01:38,819
Yes, you can.

837
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:43,056
- Jesus is ready.
- Hortense is ready.

838
01:01:44,257 --> 01:01:46,460
I'm ready, too.

839
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:51,865
Listen up. Now, this miracle requires
a great focus, a great concentration.

840
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:55,368
You, Hortense, on the couch.
Go on.

841
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,508
- And you Adam, on her lap.
- What?

842
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,511
It is critical that your flesh
is right next to each other.

843
01:02:06,413 --> 01:02:07,447
All right...

844
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,253
lap it is.

845
01:02:13,286 --> 01:02:17,490
Now, bring your ankles right
next to each other as close as you can.

846
01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:19,393
Oh, if you was my man,

847
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:23,130
I'd be sure that you put some
meat on these rippling muscles.

848
01:02:23,163 --> 01:02:25,199
Well, he's not your man,

849
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,967
so why don't you stick to the
task that you're being paid to do.

850
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:30,271
Yeah, yeah.

851
01:02:30,304 --> 01:02:33,340
You better be careful with that one
'cause she's a fiery little something.

852
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:39,512
Now, the contact must be maintained
in order for the miracle to work.

853
01:02:58,197 --> 01:02:59,299
- How is this...
- Shh!

854
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,102
No talking.

855
01:03:02,135 --> 01:03:04,071
Breathe, easily.

856
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:08,643
See the miracle happen deep,
deep, in your beings.

857
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:22,656
Pray! Thank you.

858
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:51,018
Praise the Lord!

859
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,119
It is done. It is done.

860
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:04,764
Strange how things happen.

861
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:07,066
I know, it's like a trip.

862
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:10,570
Like a road map marked with stops
and places to see and things...

863
01:04:10,603 --> 01:04:13,740
You're supposed to say,
what things?

864
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:14,741
I know.

865
01:04:16,543 --> 01:04:18,546
- Yesterday none of this...
- Yesterday was yesterday.

866
01:04:21,648 --> 01:04:26,053
The truth be told,
I knew it would come to this.

867
01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:28,121
- How?
- I don't know.

868
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:30,257
I just did.

869
01:04:45,704 --> 01:04:48,208
Oh, they're leaving.

870
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,813
Hey, we just heard that Nikki has been
arrested as an accessory for murder.

871
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:57,385
- You should be very happy.
- Yeah, ecstatic.

872
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:01,455
And I hope you didn't forget
to make that pizza order.

873
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:02,389
It's done.

874
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:08,329
Give me a minute.

875
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:34,688
Where is it?

876
01:05:52,405 --> 01:05:53,407
Thank you.

877
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:15,328
Here it is.

878
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,731
- Open it.
- Me?

879
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:20,568
Yeah.

880
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:28,509
This is it, the source.

881
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:32,612
Years of study and communication
with alien beings

882
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:34,748
and no one has been allowed
to know about.

883
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,782
But why?

884
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:40,855
Fear that anarchy would prevail.

885
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:44,425
That people wouldn't be able
to deal with it.

886
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:52,565
That it would upset all of their beliefs
about who and what they were. Are.

887
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,137
And that the powers
that be would lose control.

888
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:57,770
Exactly.

889
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:03,309
A weakness of power,
a fear of losing control.

890
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:12,785
Let's get this thing published
and change the world.

891
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:25,766
What do we do?

892
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:28,768
Son of a...

893
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:29,803
Follow me.

894
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:43,250
Oh, shit!

895
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:46,586
Who the hell are you?

896
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,387
Shut up! Where are they?

897
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,922
We're just house-sitting.

898
01:07:49,956 --> 01:07:51,959
That's what you call
what you were doing?

899
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,927
They're not here,
went to Palm Springs.

900
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,963
They never got there.
They never left the house.

901
01:07:56,996 --> 01:07:58,298
Not up there.

902
01:07:58,998 --> 01:08:00,333
You got a warrant?

903
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,702
Shut up, fatty.

904
01:08:01,735 --> 01:08:03,704
I'd be surprised
if you could even read it.

905
01:08:03,737 --> 01:08:05,838
- That's pejorative.
- What?

906
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:07,773
And against my civil rights.

907
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:09,942
Like I said, you got a warrant?

908
01:08:09,976 --> 01:08:12,947
Yeah, right here.

909
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:18,552
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

910
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:25,591
Did you order pizza?

911
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,293
Yes, it's here?

912
01:08:28,962 --> 01:08:32,332
- What's going on?
- Pepperoni and pineapples.

913
01:08:32,364 --> 01:08:36,469
That sounds disgusting.
Get rid of them.

914
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:38,871
It's paid for and I'm hungry.

915
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:49,448
I was just about to leave.

916
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:51,417
Well, good thing for you,
you didn't.

917
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:55,555
What?

918
01:08:55,587 --> 01:08:58,658
I do this for a living.
It's how I support my wife and kids.

919
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:01,027
- You got kids?
- Yeah.

920
01:09:02,494 --> 01:09:03,396
Hold on.

921
01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:11,939
You boys, you need to come up with
a couple for the delivery dude.

922
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:15,709
I'm broke.

923
01:09:15,742 --> 01:09:18,712
Look, he ain't leaving
till he gets some.

924
01:09:21,715 --> 01:09:22,916
Two broke misfits.

925
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:27,354
He got kids.

926
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:38,965
Here you go.

927
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,768
- Wow!
- Don't spend it all in one place.

928
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:44,503
What are you talking about?

929
01:09:44,537 --> 01:09:46,039
This is the down payment
on my next house.

930
01:09:46,072 --> 01:09:49,643
Don't be a smart ass.
No one likes a smart ass.

931
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,449
Who wants a piece?

932
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:59,585
- Close it.
- It'll get cold.

933
01:09:59,618 --> 01:10:02,488
Yeah, so will you
if you don't smarten up.

934
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:05,057
Don't threaten her.
She's the love of my life.

935
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:06,927
Listen, Sicky.

936
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,962
- Did they get out before we came in?
- No.

937
01:10:10,063 --> 01:10:11,698
Then they're
downstairs somewhere.

938
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,033
It's like a game
of hide-and-seek.

939
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:19,405
And you're about to go to prison where
you will be hidden for a very long time.

940
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:26,647
Is she always so uptight?

941
01:10:50,502 --> 01:10:51,572
Nice try.

942
01:10:54,908 --> 01:10:58,011
I should shoot you both just for
bringing me down into that shithole.

943
01:10:58,043 --> 01:10:59,845
Be honest, you've loved it.

944
01:10:59,878 --> 01:11:01,113
Well, not as much as you're
going to love being mauled

945
01:11:01,146 --> 01:11:03,149
by butch chicks
in the federal pen

946
01:11:03,182 --> 01:11:06,153
until that pretty little face of
yours gets ugly with wrinkles.

947
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:08,188
- Is that it?
- Yes.

948
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,589
- Finally!
- I know.

949
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:15,461
- I can't believe it.
- The recognition, the honors.

950
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:17,663
The raises, the promotions.

951
01:11:22,202 --> 01:11:26,106
Tosca, La Boheme,

952
01:11:26,139 --> 01:11:31,478
Madame Butterfly, this...
These are all operas.

953
01:11:31,511 --> 01:11:33,547
Where are they, you bastard?

954
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:35,649
Let him go, you're hurting him.

955
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:37,016
Where are they?

956
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:40,454
Why you were not happy?

957
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:42,855
- What the...?
- Time is up.

958
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:48,194
Hold it for the patience for the
few against truth to go away.

959
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:50,029
That's some fancy ventriloquism.

960
01:11:50,063 --> 01:11:52,632
- You have no idea.
- Play your games.

961
01:11:52,664 --> 01:11:54,600
This is all the evidence
we need.

962
01:11:58,805 --> 01:12:01,141
You see? It is.

963
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:05,779
And what is can only be denied
at your own peril.

964
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:09,917
Th... th... this is too weird.
I'm going to call in for backup.

965
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,720
Before you do that there's
something you should see.

966
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:17,156
Take a look at the screen.

967
01:12:23,128 --> 01:12:25,998
- Oh, my God!
- That's us.

968
01:12:57,596 --> 01:12:59,131
I love you, Simone.

969
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:12,878
You murdered two innocent people
in cold blood.

970
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:14,713
We were ordered
to stop this at any cost.

971
01:13:14,747 --> 01:13:15,649
You failed.

972
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:19,987
I suggest you two leave
and forget you were ever here,

973
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:24,658
if you want your dirty little secret
to remain a dirty little secret.

974
01:13:25,858 --> 01:13:27,094
Now, get out of here.

975
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:34,268
Take your crappy,
little ears with you.

976
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:40,740
It's scary.

977
01:13:41,807 --> 01:13:44,110
They're supposed to be
the good guys.

978
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:56,556
I'll be right back.

979
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:05,298
You know, sometimes,
I think that one can see ghosts.

980
01:14:14,873 --> 01:14:16,042
Thank you.

981
01:14:19,011 --> 01:14:20,212
It was my pleasure.

982
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:25,318
- You speak?
- I do.

983
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:30,157
- I wish I had known.
- My whispering?

984
01:14:32,091 --> 01:14:34,661
I never really heard words.

985
01:14:34,694 --> 01:14:36,930
I somehow just always knew
what you're saying.

986
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:39,898
And did I hear him
call you Simone?

987
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:43,269
That was the name I went by,
my earth name.

988
01:14:44,203 --> 01:14:48,141
Lulu is my other name.

989
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:50,176
But I was the one
who named you Lulu.

990
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:53,747
I know you think you did.

991
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:55,381
I don't understand.

992
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:57,684
You will.

993
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:03,256
You're new to this and look
at what you've accomplished.

994
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:05,090
The information you received

995
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:07,661
has been trying to get out
for more than six decades...

996
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:10,697
and you were the one
to actually make it happen.

997
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:16,036
Soon your book will be read by everyone
and the next step can finally be taken.

998
01:15:17,869 --> 01:15:18,904
And that is?

999
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:21,273
You know.

1000
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:26,046
It's time for me to leave.

1001
01:15:28,081 --> 01:15:31,083
Protect the original documents
in the package.

1002
01:15:31,117 --> 01:15:32,819
I will.

1003
01:15:32,851 --> 01:15:34,054
When will I see you again?

1004
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:46,900
Remember, there is no past
and future, it's all the same.

1005
01:15:57,275 --> 01:15:58,744
If thing's had been different.

1006
01:16:00,246 --> 01:16:01,213
I know.

1007
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:17,931
Thank you.

1008
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:21,333
I wanted to do that
since you were sent here.

1009
01:16:22,368 --> 01:16:25,372
- I was sent here?
- Of course.

1010
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:30,876
Everything that has happened has
been part of a master plan...

1011
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:35,715
for all of us,
part of our destiny.

1012
01:16:38,184 --> 01:16:39,453
Will I ever see you again?

1013
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:47,394
Always.

1014
01:17:02,073 --> 01:17:03,042
So, it's true.

1015
01:17:05,444 --> 01:17:07,948
- What?
- You're one of them.

1016
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:16,155
Takes one to know one.

1017
01:17:26,298 --> 01:17:30,302
By the power vested in me
by the Great State of California

1018
01:17:30,336 --> 01:17:34,039
and the West LA
Small Business Association,

1019
01:17:34,073 --> 01:17:38,110
I now pronounce you,
woman and husband.

1020
01:17:38,144 --> 01:17:39,479
You may kiss the bri...

1021
01:17:39,511 --> 01:17:41,346
You can't do this.
You're a locksmith.

1022
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:46,252
Hey, as God as a witness,
this marriage is for real.

1023
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:47,987
That's right, my son.

1024
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:52,025
In Venice, anything can happen
and usually does.

1025
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:53,893
Yes, yes. Now kiss.

1026
01:17:53,926 --> 01:17:56,896
We got to get you two in bed
as soon as possible.

1027
01:18:55,688 --> 01:18:58,123
Shut up, Lulu.

1028
01:18:58,157 --> 01:19:00,092
I'm in a meeting.
I can't even hear myself... Pfft.

1029
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,930
I'm your wife's therapist

1030
01:19:03,962 --> 01:19:07,666
and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to
spend the remainder of my life with her.

1031
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:10,903
There she is now.

1032
01:19:13,706 --> 01:19:15,942
I'm sorry, don't know it...

1033
01:19:22,948 --> 01:19:25,518
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1034
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:27,186
- Don't laugh.
- You can laugh.

1035
01:19:28,587 --> 01:19:31,257
- You can't laugh.
- All right.

1036
01:19:31,289 --> 01:19:32,458
Whoo-ha!

1037
01:19:37,662 --> 01:19:41,433
Did you? It was a horse.
I can't.

1038
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:46,672
I did say cut, didn't I?
She just keeps going.

1039
01:19:46,706 --> 01:19:49,108
- Are we cut?
- It's near cut.

1040
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,010
- I know this publisher. He can help us...
- No!

1041
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:55,180
You can't just run away from
this like it never happened.

1042
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:58,518
Ha, ha. No, I see Lulu behind you.
Yeah, so that doesn't work.

1043
01:20:00,552 --> 01:20:01,621
Marker.

1044
01:20:01,654 --> 01:20:03,623
I saw that.

1045
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:08,027
Look, look, pack it. Adam's fucking...
Let's do it again.

1046
01:20:17,235 --> 01:20:19,706
- Too much space.
- Were you puckering up?

1047
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:25,578
See the miracle happen
deep, deep, in your being.

1048
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:32,218
Okay, come on guys, please.
You're not in it. Get out. Get out.

1049
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,720
Get out, you're not in this.

1050
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:50,746
