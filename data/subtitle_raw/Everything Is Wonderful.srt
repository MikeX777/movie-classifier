00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,181
Friendships in
New York are like encounters

3
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,768
on a bus.

4
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,116
You might hit it off right away,

5
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:50,910
but only if you're lucky,

6
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:53,568
you also get off
at the same stop.

7
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:40,479
New York,
the famous melting pot.

8
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,411
Here are some of the
young and beautiful

9
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,689
that found their
way to the city.

10
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:49,831
Posting their saturated
Brooklyn lives on Instagram,

11
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,112
attracting even more
from all over the world.

12
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:56,012
All looking for love,
happiness and success.

13
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,498
Just like the two women
we're about to meet,

14
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,225
Maria and Lena.

15
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,882
I just don't know.

16
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:07,159
This whole new development,

17
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,851
every single guy
I hang out with,

18
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,854
they just want to have
kids like immediately.

19
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:14,270
Well, take it as a compliment.

20
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:17,790
I mean they see this big
pile of amazing genes

21
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,965
bundled up in this cute
little package of yours

22
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,451
and they wanna snatch it away.

23
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,866
Haha, but it's
actually very frustrating

24
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:28,215
because I don't even think
it's about me, you know?

25
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:29,423
It's about them.

26
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,218
I mean look at
James, he adores you,

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,084
and not the idea of you being
with him, know what I mean?

28
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:38,537
Well, adore us as
much as you like.

29
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,229
I don't know, maybe
he's just too old.

30
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,885
Oh, yeah, we don't do old.

31
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,818
They're wrinkly and
smelly and they go like

32
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:47,891
Yeah, tell me about it.

33
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,686
Should we get going?

34
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,136
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think we should.

35
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,276
- Yeah, let's get...
- Oh my God,

36
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,830
the guy's already sitting
in front of your door.

37
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,661
Well, maybe.

38
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,109
No, no, it's on me.

39
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:01,903
Come on.

40
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:02,837
No, no, no, my treat.

41
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,979
That's a really cute
bracelet, it really suits you.

42
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,533
Yes, you like it?

43
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,466
- Yeah.
- Wanna try it on?

44
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:13,296
Thank you.

45
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,918
- It's very nice.
- You can keep it.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,266
- No, come on.
- Yes, my treat.

47
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:21,164
This is very expensive.

48
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,167
I have like five
of them, it's yours.

49
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:24,997
Thank you.

50
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,209
Did you ever see this
picture on Facebook

51
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,626
that looks like a roschach
but also like an old lady?

52
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,110
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that like thing

53
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:37,905
that if you squint your eyes,

54
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,804
you might see an old lady
or a princess or something?

55
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,014
Or, yeah, or a chichi.

56
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,224
A chichi, that's
your word for it?

57
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,639
Chichi or hooha.

58
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,160
- Well, I don't know...
- Come on, check it out.

59
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,301
- I wanna show you.
- Okay, I'm gonna pull it up.

60
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,065
There, there, you see?

61
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,480
- Oh my God!
- Totally.

62
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,517
Oh my God, you're so right!

63
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,314
It's totally a chichi,
well that's good to know.

64
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,591
Why?

65
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,144
Well, next time a
guy goes down on you

66
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:13,492
and he squints his eyes, he
might discover a princess?

67
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,495
Yeah, speaking of which,
I gotta go.

68
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,670
Alright, bye, have fun.

69
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,052
- Bye.
- Bye.

70
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,262
Lena and
Maria were best friends,

71
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,298
that kind of close
friendship in your early 30's

72
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,575
when all your real best friends

73
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:29,543
have become childhood memories.

74
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,785
They met at a charity event

75
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,925
where Maria was part
of the catering group.

76
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,410
Realizing that they
were both European

77
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:36,343
was a great
conversation starter.

78
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,897
Unfortunately, it
also got Maria fired.

79
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,798
Hey.

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,455
You're home early.

81
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:20,320
Yeah.

82
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,046
Did you guys have fun?

83
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:30,571
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,090
Looks like you had fun, huh?

85
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:34,920
What?

86
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, yeah, they just left.

87
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,789
They?

88
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:46,896
I just,

89
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:49,174
I just saw her.

90
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,454
I just saw her.

91
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,180
What?

92
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:58,599
I just saw that
woman leave our house.

93
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,532
No, remember, I
told you about this.

94
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:04,085
I was having a friend
over for a drink?

95
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,124
You know, it's just a
colleague from work.

96
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,747
We talked about this, remember?

97
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,926
Hey, it's fine, hey, come here.

98
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:23,900
Oh my God, you
even smell like her.

99
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,592
Oh shit, oh shit!

100
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,801
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- What are you doing?

101
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,043
I'm looking!

102
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:31,872
Looking for what?

103
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,047
I don't know!

104
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,015
Lena, you're
being ridiculous!

105
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,882
So, is this like
a one time thing

106
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,955
or has this been
going on for a while?

107
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,545
What?

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,306
Listen, you are really
stressed out, Lena, okay?

109
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,790
Don't put this on me.

110
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,067
No, listen, I'm not
trying to put it on you.

111
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,485
All I'm trying to say is
that we're both working

112
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:01,246
through a lot of problems
right now and just...

113
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,730
That's not an excuse!

114
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:04,836
Listen, let's just, can
we please sit down and talk?

115
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,354
Please?

116
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:08,356
- Please, can we just...
- Don't fucking touch me!

117
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,187
Okay, fine.

118
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:22,994
I'm leaving.

119
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:29,897
Fine.

120
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:31,554
Go.

121
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,558
Go.

122
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,426
Lena!

123
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,256
Fuck.

124
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,272
- Strawberry?
- Nm-nm.

125
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,482
Come on.

126
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,655
- Just one.
- No, no.

127
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,485
Just a strawberry.

128
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,831
Can't you see I'm smoking?

129
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,315
Yes, I can see that.

130
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:11,903
Didn't you say you
wanted to quit anyway?

131
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,354
Well, I've changed my mind.

132
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:18,047
Again, and again, and again,
always changing your mind.

133
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,911
That's what I'm talking about.

134
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,602
You can't commit to anything.

135
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,810
Man, what's your problem?

136
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,985
We're having great
sex, we're having fun,

137
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,574
I don't want anything of
you, you should be happy.

138
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,299
Yes, but I'm not happy.

139
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,130
Why?

140
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:33,409
Look,

141
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,444
- you're 30 years old...
- I'm 29.

142
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:37,551
Okay, almost 30.

143
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:41,139
Do you know what that means, hm?

144
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:44,142
You're on your best years,
don't waste them around.

145
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,144
You should have a baby.

146
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,525
- A baby?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,767
No.

148
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,044
Don't you want to
have a baby with me?

149
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,356
No, I don't want
a baby, no babies.

150
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,531
Wow, women of your generation.

151
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,153
What is wrong
with my generation?

152
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,879
The problem is you
can't commit to anything.

153
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,571
Okay, in a perfect world,

154
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,022
what's an ideal woman for you?

155
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,541
- You're asking?
- Mm-hm.

156
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,371
Okay.

157
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:08,476
I would like a woman that
bakes a strawberry pie

158
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:11,928
in the morning, gives me
a blowjob in the night.

159
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,896
You're disgusting,

160
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,932
- that's absolutely disgusting.
- Come on, I was kidding.

161
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,865
- Come on, I was joking!
- No, you're disgusting,

162
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,142
- that's not even funny.
- I was joking about

163
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,074
- the strawberry pie.
- No, you know what?

164
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,282
Just leave, okay?

165
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,560
- What's wrong?
- Just leave, go away.

166
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,733
- No, I want you out.
- Come on, come on.

167
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,563
No, no, leave, leave,
I want you to leave.

168
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,667
- Are you serious?
- Go, leave,

169
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,222
yes, I'm serious, leave.

170
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,985
- Go!
- Okay, I'm going.

171
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,585
As much
as Maria had enough

172
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,241
of men explaining her life,

173
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,381
Lena had enough of her marriage.

174
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,211
She wasn't sure
what she had seen

175
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:55,144
or if she had seen
anything at all.

176
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:59,493
Her decision to leave made
her sad, but not sad enough.

177
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,668
This
is Kings Highway.

178
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,672
And her confusion
lead her to Maria's place.

179
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:08,366
Do you think this has been
going on for a long time?

180
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,439
I mean, I don't know.

181
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,543
I had a strange feeling lately,

182
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,652
we had some problems, but...

183
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,239
I don't know.

184
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,691
I am so sorry.

185
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,693
I mean, James, who
would have thought?

186
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,765
He was always so
concerned about you.

187
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,975
But then again, I've only met
him a couple of times anyway.

188
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:34,047
What an ass.

189
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,875
Wanna sleep over tonight?

190
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:40,707
No, thank you, I don't
think I can sleep right now.

191
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,673
Do you want some wine?

192
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,916
I could use a glass of wine.

193
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:45,712
I had a pretty fucked up
date myself, actually.

194
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:49,716
Oh my God, you, I totally
forgot, your guy was here.

195
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,372
- I'm sorry, I can, I can...
- Why are you sorry?

196
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:52,719
No, no, no, stop it.

197
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:55,342
Relax, you know
what we're gonna do?

198
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,171
We're gonna have a party.

199
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,448
That's it, we're
gonna have a party,

200
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,830
my roommates are not here, so,

201
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,453
we could have some booze
and something to smoke,

202
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,938
- we could have fun.
- I don't know.

203
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,492
That's what we're gonna
do, and it's gonna be great.

204
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:08,564
I'll take care of it.

205
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,258
This was
Maria's typical way

206
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,019
of handling a crisis.

207
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:20,056
And Lena, Lena
didn't mind at all.

208
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:04,516
Morning.

209
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,967
Good morning.

210
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,570
Fuck.

211
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,159
Shoes.

212
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,096
Let's go.

213
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,721
So, what are you gonna do now?

214
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:41,137
I don't know, I mean,

215
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,346
right now I feel really hungover

216
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,903
so I don't really wanna
wrap my head around it.

217
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,904
Are you getting a divorce?

218
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,942
Wow, um...

219
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:56,601
I don't even know what
happens to my visa then, so.

220
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,364
Oh shit, yeah, that's true,
you can't get a divorce.

221
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,710
At least you can keep the house.

222
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:04,678
No, he can stay
at the apartment,

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,025
- I don't care about it.
- What, are you crazy?

224
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,924
First of all, it's
an awesome apartment,

225
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:10,201
and second of all, darling,

226
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,685
you know I love you
but you can't stay

227
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,757
in my shit hole forever,
you gotta get the apartment.

228
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,279
You know, I know it
sounds strange, but,

229
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:21,212
the apartment, all of
it, never made me happy.

230
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,697
That's bullshit,
we can redecorate.

231
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,216
He's the one who cheated on you,

232
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,149
he has to give
you the apartment.

233
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,909
You gotta conquer that castle!

234
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:29,841
What?

235
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,154
Conquer the castle.

236
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,259
Maria, I don't think that's
an expression.

237
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:37,400
Doesn't matter, this
asshole has to go.

238
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:40,058
I'm gonna conquer
that castle, watch me.

239
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,405
Oh my God, Maria,
you're crazy.

240
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:31,765
Where were you?

241
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,008
I was worried all night.

242
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,664
I don't think you care.

243
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,596
Lena, of course I care.

244
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,735
You shitbag!

245
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:38,392
What is she doing here?

246
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,877
We conquered the castle!

247
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,361
What?

248
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,398
Well, I think it's better
if you leave for a while.

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,606
For a while?

250
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:46,989
Better forever, you
fucking cheater.

251
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,855
Lena, can we talk
about this in private?

252
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,616
I don't think I can
talk to you right now.

253
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:56,548
See?

254
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,378
Just pack your shit and go.

255
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,554
I already packed my
bags, you can shut up.

256
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,730
Listen,

257
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,081
maybe we both need just some
time to figure this out.

258
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:14,566
I also need a break.

259
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:15,397
Okay.

260
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:18,434
Okay.

261
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,095
So, I'm gonna leave if
that's what you want.

262
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:25,925
Okay.

263
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,724
See you in a week.

264
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,107
Wow, that was easy.

265
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,248
What now?

266
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:46,667
What are you doing?

267
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,741
I'm gonna burn
his fucking clothes!

268
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,744
Fuck, fuck.

269
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,231
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

270
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,783
- Yes, there we go.
- That's not gonna work.

271
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,681
Yeah, it's gonna
work, you see?

272
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,619
There you go, there
you go, oh, oh!

273
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:09,104
Fuck, fuck!

274
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,008
Fuck, oh my God.

275
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,634
Just leave them here.

276
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,602
Okay.

277
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,259
The pathetic
attempt of burning

278
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,433
her husband's clothes
didn't satisfy Lena's need

279
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:29,883
of destruction.

280
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,471
James' decision to leave even

281
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,714
caused a brief
flickering or doubt.

282
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,545
As the cold water
ran over her body,

283
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,651
doubt became fear.

284
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,207
Lena?

285
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,139
Yeah?

286
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:45,416
Can I wear this dress?

287
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,039
Sure, just give me two
minutes, I'll be there.

288
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,249
Okay.

289
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,641
Maria
suggested a night out

290
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:06,128
and Lena gladly tagged along.

291
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:10,648
Maria had always
considered the attention

292
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,512
of men to be reassuring.

293
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:13,823
As long as she had her youth,

294
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,136
and her presence and her beauty,

295
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:17,346
she would always get by.

296
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:22,039
Lena was more reserved
in that matter,

297
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,971
but tried to follow her lead.

298
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:38,469
What are you doing?

299
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,540
You're still wearing
your wedding ring?

300
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,782
Yeah.

301
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:44,130
I thought you wanted
to have fun tonight.

302
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,132
I'm having fun, I'm dancing!

303
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,066
Take it off.

304
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,549
I, I don't wanna
lose it, come on.

305
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,758
I thought you didn't
care about money.

306
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,588
I don't.

307
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,728
Come on, I'll fix it.

308
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,559
One,

309
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,597
this would work.

310
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:05,222
- Alright, another round?
- Sure.

311
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:25,481
Maria and Lena
felt closer than ever before.

312
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,173
Hours went by, lost.

313
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,657
But all that seemed
to matter now

314
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,177
were the possibilities
of the moment.

315
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,834
"Follow your heart,
and you may shine."

316
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:09,801
What the fuck
does it even mean?

317
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,737
I have no idea,
what does yours say?

318
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:18,914
"The path to
everything is love."

319
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,262
Oh, God!

320
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,714
Well, yeah, right.

321
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,822
By the way, I had this really
weird dream last night.

322
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,412
I dreamt like either I
was wearing a wig, or,

323
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,485
I had just black
hair, I don't know.

324
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:38,729
Well, I think...

325
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:43,249
I was you, if that
makes any sense.

326
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,078
That's a very
interesting dream.

327
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,908
Yeah.

328
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,324
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

329
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,567
- I'm late for work.
- No!

330
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,259
- Yeah.
- No, don't leave me.

331
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:57,539
Don't, no, quit your job and
stay with me here, please.

332
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,161
Shut up.

333
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,415
Guys, where's my steak frites?

334
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:17,733
Enjoy.

335
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:27,983
Maria, a word, please?

336
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,467
Of course.

337
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,987
Listen, when you're on the
floor, you need to smile.

338
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:35,818
We sell food here, good
makes people happy, right?

339
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,303
- Yeah, okay.
- Do you like working here?

340
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,856
Yeah, I do, I do.

341
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,686
From what I understand,
you need this job.

342
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:44,206
No other fine dining
establishment is gonna hire you,

343
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,898
so please, adjust your attitude.

344
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,350
- Okay.
- So, let me see it.

345
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:50,352
Alright.

346
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:08,506
While
Maria was dealing

347
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,612
with an irrational boss and
the stress of making a living,

348
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:13,306
Lena sat at home
wondering about mortality.

349
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:19,690
She had always been fascinated
about life's vulnerability.

350
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:22,865
A fascination that could
quickly turn into obsession.

351
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,006
Especially when there's
not much else to do.

352
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,462
Bones.

353
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:34,914
Skin, and bones.

354
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:38,435
Blood.

355
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,300
White blood cells.

356
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,164
Inflammation.

357
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,961
Hives, pox?

358
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,309
Chicken pox.

359
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:54,243
Meningitis.

360
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:01,043
Castleman disease.

361
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:07,084
Crest disease, lyme disease.

362
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:09,845
Poems syndrome.

363
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,641
Liver failure.

364
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,058
Kidney failure.

365
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:21,512
Congenital heart block.

366
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:35,630
Lina?

367
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,806
Lina?

368
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:44,432
Lina!

369
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,092
Um, it's actually Leh-na.

370
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,475
The doctor's
ready for you now.

371
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,669
The doctor will
be right with you.

372
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:18,947
Lena had seen
Dr. Hollis for a while now.

373
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,777
He was kind and patient,
and didn't seem to mind

374
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,952
that she visited him often.

375
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,748
Especially after
last year's incident

376
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,232
of bleeding out a
cluster of cells

377
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:30,132
that had formed a
fetus inside of her.

378
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:34,376
Hi, Lena.

379
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,931
- Hi, Doctor Hollis.
- What's going on?

380
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:38,518
Um,

381
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,865
I just feel all
drained of energy.

382
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:45,076
I have these headaches,
like right here

383
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,078
and sometimes up here.

384
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,563
I just don't feel that good.

385
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,461
How long has that
been happening?

386
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:52,808
Um, maybe two months?

387
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,016
Yeah.

388
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:56,952
Okay, let's take
a look at you.

389
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,437
That looks good.

390
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,335
Look to your left,

391
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:03,165
let's see.

392
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:08,583
Well,

393
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,860
you look good to me, I mean,

394
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,621
we can have the nurse
draw some blood,

395
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:14,554
see if there's any deficiencies,

396
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:15,831
but other than
that, you look fine.

397
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,903
Okay, yeah, yeah,
let's do that.

398
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,387
Okay.

399
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,976
Their
new living situation

400
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,116
has soon enough provided
a consoling pattern

401
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:27,153
which tightened
their friendship.

402
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:28,534
Waking up together
in the morning

403
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:30,225
and going out together at night.

404
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:33,953
Today, it was Maria whose
emotions were in turmoil.

405
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:36,576
Not only was her boss
a pain in the ass,

406
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:39,648
but her ex-lover had also tried
to call her several times.

407
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,583
My boss, he's so
sleazy, he's so annoying,

408
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,414
he gets on my
nerves all the time.

409
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,278
Ugh, I wish I could do
something about it, but,

410
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,661
he's gonna have me deported.

411
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:52,732
I'm sorry.

412
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,043
Yeah.

413
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:58,218
Maybe I should marry an
American just like you did.

414
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,774
Well, we saw how that goes.

415
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:04,123
Come on, I bet he's
calling you all the time.

416
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,094
This city's just so beautiful.

417
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,027
Is it though?

418
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,546
I remember when I was
a kid and I came here

419
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,446
for the first time on vacation.

420
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,345
I just thought the
city is so sterile,

421
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:23,243
it doesn't even smell.

422
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:25,004
Are you crazy?

423
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,834
New York stinks, everywhere.

424
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,458
Must have been a winter holiday.

425
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,288
Christmas shopping.

426
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,152
You spoiled bitch.

427
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:36,429
Ow!

428
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,294
Come with me, I
have an idea, come.

429
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:41,745
- Where are you going?
- Just come.

430
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:43,470
Are you ready?

431
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:44,920
- Yes.
- One,

432
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:46,957
- Two, three.
- Two three!

433
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,594
One more!

434
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:04,526
Enjoy, ladies.

435
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,148
Thank you.

436
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,155
Cheers!

437
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:14,156
- Another round?
- Sure.

438
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:15,263
Two more.

439
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,195
- Fuck.
- What?

440
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:20,061
The guy you're
hooking up with,

441
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,200
he's right over there.

442
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:24,030
- Where?
- There.

443
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:28,239
Just ignore him.

444
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,138
He's right there,
he just saw you.

445
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,174
I wanna know more about you.

446
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,349
Did you ever have a proper job?

447
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,937
Are you serious right now?

448
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,215
Yeah, like a proper
job, not advertising...

449
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:40,702
- Are we really doing this?
- Mm-hm.

450
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,429
Oh, um...

451
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:49,744
Actually, um, yeah, I once
worked on an assembly line.

452
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,504
One summer, when I was 16,

453
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:53,299
my dad wanted my sister and me

454
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:56,060
to experience "the real world,"

455
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:57,786
which is hilarious
'cause he's spending

456
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,064
all his life in
conference rooms.

457
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:01,963
Actually, he wanted us
to be lawyers like him,

458
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:03,035
but yeah, so.

459
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:06,383
I wanna know more
about the assembly line.

460
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,488
Of course.

461
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,043
It was not that bad, I
mean, the actual labor.

462
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:16,425
The worst part was that
they were listening

463
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,394
to the same radio
station all day long

464
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,052
and there were only so many pop
songs they played, you know?

465
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,296
That, and they talked
about soap operas a lot.

466
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,679
Poor you.

467
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,406
You were once in a
soap opera, weren't you?

468
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:32,338
Yes, yes, I was.

469
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,065
What was that name again?

470
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:39,897
- And that means?
- Heart On Fire.

471
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,485
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

472
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,040
Oh, fuck they're coming over.

473
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:47,629
Good evening, ladies.

474
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:48,457
Hi.

475
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,735
Hello.

476
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:50,667
Would it be cool
if we joined you?

477
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,945
Sure, hi, my name is Lena.

478
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:54,360
- Rick.
- Nice to meet you.

479
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:55,706
Hi, I'm Palo.

480
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,880
- Hi, Lena.
- I'm Maria.

481
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:59,468
- Maria.
- Maria, nice to meet you.

482
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,022
What are you guys drinking?

483
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:02,644
We had shots.

484
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,785
Yeah, you care
for another one?

485
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,097
- Sure.
- Yeah.

486
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,477
What are you drinking?

487
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,721
- Vodka?
- Sure, alright.

488
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,619
Could we have four more please?

489
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:28,042
Lena woke up alone.

490
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:35,532
Neither James nor
Maria were there.

491
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,295
The apartment was awfully quiet

492
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,713
and she felt rather
small and unimportant.

493
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,823
When she closed on eye,
and then the other,

494
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,205
per perspective would shift.

495
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,553
At least one thing
offered her some comfort.

496
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,797
Lena thought of her childhood

497
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,937
and how things were
a little better then.

498
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:54,853
Lina?

499
00:30:58,408 --> 00:30:59,236
Lina?

500
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:03,862
Lina!

501
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,141
It's still Leh-na.

502
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,419
Okay.

503
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,876
- Hi, Lena.
- Hi, Dr. Hollis.

504
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,325
Your blood work is not in yet,

505
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,985
is there anything
else I can do for you?

506
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:26,643
Um...

507
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:31,268
Uh, yeah, okay, um...

508
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:41,690
Maria had
a stressful morning.

509
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,969
Her ex-lover, Palo, had
left her several angry

510
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,592
and condescending
messages the night before.

511
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,456
And even though she
liked his passion,

512
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,355
she disliked the ownership
he took over her.

513
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,426
Can I get you anything else?

514
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,984
- Maria, what's up?
- Hi.

515
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,226
How are you?

516
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,676
That's a cute outfit
today, I love it.

517
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:02,953
- Thank you.
- Is this 100% cotton,

518
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,334
because myself,
I'm a cotton man,

519
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,508
I love 100% cotton,
that's all I wear,

520
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,200
- you know?
- Okay, I'm really busy, Bill,

521
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,410
- bye.
- Alright, see ya.

522
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,861
Hello, may I take your order?

523
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:15,897
Surprise.

524
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,554
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:19,349
- Quit your job.
- I can't.

526
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,591
Yes, you gotta quit your job.

527
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,455
Shut up, I told you, I can't.

528
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,043
What do you want?

529
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:26,597
Well then, I'll have
the lobster salad, please.

530
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,703
- Are you serious?
- Chop, chop.

531
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:31,294
I'm gonna spit in your salad.

532
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:39,472
Both feeling
rather unhappy by themselves

533
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,026
and only happy together,

534
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:44,790
Maria and Lena decided to
make Lena's dream come true.

535
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:48,552
They decided to become
the other person.

536
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:50,934
At least for one night.

537
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,729
"Content is happiness.

538
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:40,455
Happiness is content."

539
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,286
Okay.

540
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:48,016
That's interesting.

541
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:51,949
"What's meant to be
will always find a way."

542
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:53,192
Hm.

543
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,367
And it's interesting
I get that today.

544
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:56,920
Why?

545
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,717
I have an audition tomorrow.

546
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
Oh my God, that's great!

547
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:02,408
Yeah, yeah, I know.

548
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,927
What is it for?

549
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,756
It's for a space film.

550
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:08,106
- Cool!
- Yeah.

551
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,384
Congratulations.

552
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:15,318
Thank you, I mean, I
didn't get it yet, but,

553
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,562
you know, it'll work out.

554
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,118
Cool, I'm happy for you.

555
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:25,983
But you promised, you
promised you would stay

556
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:28,262
with me forever, fuck.

557
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,243
Maria
had the feeling

558
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,038
that this was finally
the opportunity

559
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,488
she had been waiting for.

560
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,559
There was a better version
of herself out there,

561
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:51,183
and she was close
to becoming it,

562
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,945
if she could only find a
way to calm her nerves.

563
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:06,336
But you promised.

564
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,651
You promised you
would never leave me.

565
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:16,827
You promised you would
stay with me forever

566
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,726
in the outer realm space...

567
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,106
Fuck!

568
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:21,834
Space station.

569
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,320
Space station, space station.

570
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,849
Space station.

571
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:41,266
No, no, no, outer
realm space station.

572
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:44,407
But you promised, you promised
you would never leave me.

573
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:46,581
You promised you would
stay with me forever

574
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,376
in the outer realm
space station,

575
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,829
this is, who the
fuck wrote this?

576
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:58,352
But you promised, you
promised you would never

577
00:36:58,354 --> 00:36:59,424
leave me.

578
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:08,329
Fuck.

579
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,295
Lena!

580
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:11,953
I've got nothing to wear!

581
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,507
I mean, look,
this could work, no?

582
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:16,439
Wow.

583
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:19,925
It's futuristic and feminine.

584
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,685
What was the role
description again?

585
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:25,413
A space steward
determined, by sensual.

586
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:29,762
Well, this is totally
determined but sensual.

587
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,248
I know, but, you know,

588
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,457
it's too expensive, I can't.

589
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,700
Oh, no, I want you to wear it.

590
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,153
Come on, you can even
keep it if you want.

591
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:42,225
Thank you.

592
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,957
And do you need any
accessories, any jewelry?

593
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,717
Yeah, but that's,
you know, too much

594
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:57,273
Not at all, just have
a look, I got plenty.

595
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,069
Okay, thank you!

596
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,039
Wow, this is, this is perfect!

597
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,938
And there's like
this necklace, maybe?

598
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,768
Oh, sure.

599
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,184
Yep!

600
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:14,117
While Lena was happy
to have helped Maria,

601
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,914
she had her own
business to tend to.

602
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,157
Lina?

603
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:31,723
Hm...

604
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:36,624
Your blood work came
back, it looks great.

605
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38,419
It's normal,

606
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,111
everything is wonderful.

607
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:45,288
You're healthy,
just keep trying.

608
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:56,851
Maybe I'm not the
right doctor for you.

609
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:00,821
Oh, really?

610
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,891
You know what?

611
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,792
Forget about this, fuck this.

612
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,140
That evening,

613
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,282
both Lena and Maria
seemed awfully tense.

614
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,184
Want more wine?

615
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,120
Who are you texting with?

616
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,986
Don't worry, it's
not your husband.

617
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:32,920
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

618
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,129
I'm so sorry, it's
just this audition,

619
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:38,581
I'm so stressed about it
and the lines are so bad.

620
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,099
If you want, I can't
rehearse with you.

621
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:43,588
No, no, actually, I'd
rather go to bed, I'm sorry.

622
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,593
Good night.

623
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,090
Hm, "Fall in love
with your life."

624
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,198
Gotta go, gotta
go to my audition.

625
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,407
Okay, good luck,
break a leg, huh?

626
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,583
See ya later.

627
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,464
Maria,
we're ready for you.

628
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,645
Okay, let's
start with the slate,

629
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:18,577
what's your name?

630
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:20,924
My name is Maria Kalitsi.

631
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,478
Hi,
Maria, how tall are you?

632
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,031
I'm five foot six.

633
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,273
Okay, I'd
like to see your profile,

634
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,760
can you turn to
the left, please?

635
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,383
Lovely, and to the right?

636
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:35,042
Okay, fantastic, let's jump
right in, are you ready?

637
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,181
I'm ready.

638
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:37,460
And action.

639
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:43,671
But, you promised me.

640
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:45,328
You promised you
would stay forever

641
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,986
with me in the outer
realm space station.

642
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,229
But that was
before everything happened.

643
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:51,888
I don't think I
love you anymore.

644
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:57,374
Okay, thank you.

645
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:58,652
Maria, there's one more thing.

646
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:00,067
You know this love scene,

647
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:02,379
the one where you're
supposed to be giving the BJ?

648
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,760
Yeah?

649
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:06,107
The director
would like to know

650
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,730
if you could show him
what you would do.

651
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:09,732
So, here's a prop.

652
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,285
What do you mean?

653
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:12,804
Uh,
just, you know,

654
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,946
if you could like show us with
the bottle what you would do.

655
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:18,085
Are you serious?

656
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,640
Just hold
it up towards your mouth.

657
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,509
While
Maria was auditioning,

658
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:29,890
Lena had time to think.

659
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:32,202
Lena felt that they
were both drifting apart

660
00:42:32,204 --> 00:42:33,307
and that she wanted to have

661
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:35,378
an honest conversation
with Maria.

662
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,207
Lena also wanted to come clean,

663
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:39,557
and tell Maria what really
happened with James.

664
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,212
Hey.

665
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:43,628
Hey!

666
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,285
- How did it go?
- Shit.

667
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,496
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

668
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:50,947
What happened?

669
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:52,570
Maria!

670
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,133
Hi.

671
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:06,927
Oh, fuck.

672
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:08,586
Um, Maria,

673
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:12,797
um, that's my sister.

674
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:14,790
I am so sorry!

675
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,776
In English: Are you two lesbian?

676
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:39,502
You and my sister,
are you lovers?

677
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:40,986
Julia!

678
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,022
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:43,092
Okay, you know what, guys?

680
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,820
I better leave you two alone.

681
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:49,894
Maria, you don't have
to go, I'm sorry, Maria?

682
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:36,699
Mhm.

683
00:47:39,235 --> 00:47:40,685
I am so sorry.

684
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:55,905
While Lena
was still contemplating

685
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,183
her complicated relationship
with her sister,

686
00:47:58,185 --> 00:47:59,944
Maria felt like
burning down a house

687
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:01,982
or destroying an
expensive Chinese vase.

688
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,570
Anything would do that
could lighten the anger

689
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,885
and disappointment she
felt growing inside her.

690
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:12,199
So, she first turned to
alcohol, and then to sex,

691
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:15,511
two things that had worked
out for her in the past.

692
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,317
Another round?

693
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,216
It's on the house.

694
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,978
Sounds tempting, but um...

695
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,600
I think I shouldn't.

696
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:37,293
Yeah, I know that feeling.

697
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:41,606
I do serve more than
drinks though, you know.

698
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,248
Maria
stopped at a playground,

699
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,078
trying to remember how easy
it was when she was a child.

700
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,907
But she couldn't.

701
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:50,780
My ball.

702
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,712
What, you're not
gonna apologize?

703
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:55,024
You just hit me.

704
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,131
Where are you manners?

705
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,272
You know what?

706
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:02,240
Here's your ball, bye now.

707
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,000
Bitch.

708
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:01,435
When they
woke up the next morning,

709
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:03,955
they were both still so
absorbed in their own troubles

710
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:05,991
that they could not
even face each other.

711
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:30,015
Maria, what's up?

712
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,569
- Hi.
- How you doing?

713
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:33,053
- Good.
- You look so great today.

714
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:35,538
I love your hair, are you doing
something different with it?

715
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,092
- You look fantastic.
- Mm-hm, I'm really busy,

716
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,300
- I'm so sorry, Bill.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

717
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:40,994
well, you know, alright, see ya.

718
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:48,965
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

719
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,381
You know, you look
so familiar to me.

720
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:51,658
Yeah?

721
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,624
Yeah, do I know
you from somewhere?

722
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:55,006
Um, no, no I don't think so.

723
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:56,283
Are you Greek?

724
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:58,320
Yes, yes, I'm Greek, yeah.

725
00:51:58,322 --> 00:51:59,495
Okay, um...

726
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,500
You're on that TV show!

727
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:06,776
Yeah, right?

728
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:08,192
Yeah, I used to watch it
every summer in Greece

729
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:10,918
with my grandparents, my
grandparents are from Kefalonia.

730
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,644
Yeah, what are you doing here?

731
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:13,852
Um, I'm working here.

732
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:15,546
Yeah, why are
you waiting tables?

733
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,031
I moved to New York.

734
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,758
- Maria?
- Yes?

735
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
For the last time,
you need to be friendly.

736
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:25,968
I am friendly.

737
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,349
No, you're a pretty girl.

738
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:30,214
This city is filled
with pretty girls.

739
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:32,802
Girls who would
love the opportunity

740
00:52:32,804 --> 00:52:34,494
to work at my restaurant.

741
00:52:34,496 --> 00:52:37,635
Girls who would personally
thank me for the opportunity.

742
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:40,364
Personally thank me
for the opportunity.

743
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,847
Okay, that's it.

744
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:44,089
Come on, Maria,
you don't need to...

745
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:45,677
- I quit.
- You don't have to do this.

746
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:46,611
Fuck you.

747
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:49,233
Maria, come back, Maria!

748
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,565
Hey.

749
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,396
Hi.

750
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:18,816
Can I buy you a drink?

751
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:21,439
Sure.

752
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,014
No,

753
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:47,912
please, please.

754
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:49,327
- What?
- Stop.

755
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:50,572
Did I do
something wrong?

756
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:53,609
No, I'm sorry.

757
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,166
Please, I can't.

758
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:01,546
What?

759
00:54:01,548 --> 00:54:02,377
I'm sorry,

760
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:06,243
I just can't, I can't.

761
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:22,259
Can I at least jerk off on you?

762
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:30,817
Lena!

763
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:32,819
Lena, I quit my job!

764
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:35,339
Lena, Lena!

765
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,064
I quit my job!

766
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,721
- What?
- I quit my...

767
00:54:38,723 --> 00:54:39,688
Hi.

768
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,207
Oh, are we having a party now?

769
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:44,451
Uh, sorry, I didn't
know you had company.

770
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,591
Well, actually, he
was just about to leave.

771
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:47,937
- Oh.
- Oh.

772
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:49,389
- Okay.
- Okay.

773
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,329
Know what?

774
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:02,711
I think we should
go to the Hamptons.

775
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:04,644
- Now?
- Yes, now.

776
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,231
I know this guy, he has a house.

777
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,027
Let's go.

778
00:55:08,028 --> 00:55:09,511
Hm.

779
00:55:09,513 --> 00:55:10,479
Come on, we need
to get out of the city.

780
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:13,929
Okay.

781
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:37,262
That's disgusting,
you're disgusting.

782
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:38,850
- Here.
- No, no, no!

783
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:46,617
No, show me.

784
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:47,894
Oh, I can't, it'd be like,

785
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:52,381
- no, no, no, I don't...
- Are you cold?

786
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:56,974
That's a man horse.

787
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:02,011
No?

788
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,530
Come on.

789
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:05,120
I'll do a turtle.

790
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:11,366
- Wait.
- Okay, I'm waiting.

791
00:56:35,046 --> 00:56:36,011
Maria!

792
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:37,115
Okay, this is it.

793
00:56:37,117 --> 00:56:38,634
Maria, what are you doing?

794
00:56:38,636 --> 00:56:40,464
- Come on, get up.
- What if someone's home?

795
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:41,982
There's no one home,
he has like five houses,

796
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:43,777
that's why he used to
bring me here all the time.

797
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:46,608
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, it's gonna be fine.

798
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,543
- Trust me.
- Oh my God.

799
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:51,164
What's going on?

800
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:51,994
Come on.

801
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,651
Fuck, the keys, he
always leaves the keys.

802
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:56,482
Okay.

803
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,965
Maria!

804
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,484
Maria!

805
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:01,487
Fuck, fuck.

806
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:05,732
Shit, shit, shit.

807
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,252
What?

808
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:11,807
What?

809
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,083
Fuck.

810
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:14,983
Shit, shit,

811
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,089
shit, shit, shit, ugh!

812
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,443
What?

813
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:39,488
Tada!

814
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,731
Did you just break in?

815
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:43,460
Uh, not exactly.

816
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:49,017
Are you bleeding?

817
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:53,297
Eh, not really,
come on, come in.

818
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,679
Shit.

819
00:57:57,404 --> 00:57:59,991
No, I mean, I totally get it,

820
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:03,512
my sister and I, we're just
very different, you know?

821
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,135
I mean, she likes
to please my father

822
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:10,866
and loves her conservative
way of life, and...

823
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,764
I totally respect that.

824
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,699
No, you don't.

825
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:20,220
No, I don't, I'm an asshole.

826
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:22,462
You know what?

827
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:24,706
I actually think she
has a crush on James.

828
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,743
Perfect timing.

829
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,575
I mean, now that her
sister is a lesbian.

830
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:32,714
Yeah.

831
00:58:32,716 --> 00:58:33,820
Good for her.

832
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:39,136
No, I mean it, maybe
we should consider.

833
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:42,378
I mean, I'm having a
great time with you,

834
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,108
and you're having
fun with me, right?

835
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,385
Always.

836
00:58:49,387 --> 00:58:50,216
See?

837
00:58:54,669 --> 00:58:55,566
So...

838
00:58:57,568 --> 00:59:00,327
should we, should we,
should we do this?

839
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,917
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

840
00:59:02,987 --> 00:59:03,816
Let's do it.

841
00:59:04,886 --> 00:59:05,988
- Let's do it.
- Oh, okay.

842
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,819
Let's do it.

843
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:11,617
You're very pretty.

844
00:59:12,618 --> 00:59:14,309
You're very pretty also.

845
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,104
Thank you.

846
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:39,297
- No.
- No, I'm sorry.

847
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:41,645
I'm, yeah, I'm
definitely into guys.

848
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,204
Being out
in the Hamptons seemed

849
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:50,964
to make everything
so much easier.

850
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:55,624
Lena swam in the cold water
for hours, clearing her head,

851
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,767
while Maria was lying in the
hot sun thinking of nothing.

852
01:00:02,564 --> 01:00:05,047
Oh, it's cold.

853
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:05,912
It's nice, no?

854
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:09,880
Ugh, teenagers.

855
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,191
I know.

856
01:00:11,193 --> 01:00:13,918
- I hate them.
- I get it.

857
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,613
They always feel
so, invincible.

858
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:20,200
"Remisuri"

859
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:21,857
What?

860
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:23,583
It's an old Bavarian word,

861
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:25,723
meaning the
exuberance of children

862
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:27,587
and the absence of parents.

863
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:28,761
That's one word?

864
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,383
Yeah, it's pretty
good, isn't it?

865
01:00:30,385 --> 01:00:31,800
Okay, remi...

866
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,284
"Remisuri"

867
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,146
"Suri" like the
daughter of Tom Cruise.

868
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:36,078
Well, in that case,

869
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,494
I'm pretty "remisuri" myself.

870
01:00:38,496 --> 01:00:40,531
I think our whole
generation is.

871
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,947
Yeah, you know,
when I was born,

872
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:45,952
my mother named me Maria
after Maria Callas.

873
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,297
No shit.

874
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,506
Yeah, she actually did that.

875
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:51,922
She used to say I was
the prettiest girl

876
01:00:51,924 --> 01:00:53,717
in the neighborhood.

877
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:56,789
Once my mom told me my
beauty's a currency,

878
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,654
and that I could actually
pay with my beauty.

879
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,689
Wow.

880
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:01,727
Yeah, she's amazing.

881
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:08,835
When I was 14, there was
this boy that fancied me,

882
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:10,526
and he followed me home.

883
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:15,014
My mom was at work,
so, when we got in,

884
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:18,465
he said I was the prettiest
girl he had ever seen.

885
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,366
He was so nice, so I
gave him a blowjob.

886
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:23,196
In the kitchen.

887
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:28,579
My mom was pretty as well,
but she got knocked up.

888
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,480
She was so proud of me when
I got that shitty soap opera.

889
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:34,792
But I wanted to
be a real actress,

890
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,935
I want to be a real actress,
that's why I came to New York.

891
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:41,939
But now, karma fires back.

892
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:47,738
Now, I have to give
blowjobs in audition rooms.

893
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:51,984
God, I prefer the
one in my kitchen.

894
01:01:56,574 --> 01:02:00,369
You know, I was
pregnant last year.

895
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:01,165
I lost it.

896
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,685
Lena, I'm sorry.

897
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,860
I don't even know if
I want to put children

898
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:09,484
into this world anyway.

899
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:12,659
I'm so sorry.

900
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,060
Oh man, you know
what your problem is?

901
01:02:36,062 --> 01:02:37,821
What is my problem?

902
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,305
Tell me.

903
01:02:39,307 --> 01:02:41,479
You have to say that
you are an actress

904
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,723
before you can be an actress.

905
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:45,518
But, that's not true.

906
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,727
No, I mean, you have to say,

907
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:51,627
"Hi, my name is Maria,
I'm an actress."

908
01:02:51,629 --> 01:02:54,492
But, that's not true, I...

909
01:02:54,494 --> 01:02:57,254
I've never been paid
for anything I've done,

910
01:02:57,256 --> 01:02:59,394
and I haven't worked
in such a long time.

911
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:01,881
Oh come on,
money's so overrated.

912
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,160
That's easy for you to say.

913
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:09,576
But, I'm gonna tell
you a little secret.

914
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:13,753
You actually need money
to survive in this world,

915
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:16,894
like pay your rent...

916
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:18,102
Really?

917
01:03:18,104 --> 01:03:20,346
And go shopping.

918
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:23,349
Shocker, I kind of knew that.

919
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:24,248
That's progress.

920
01:03:26,872 --> 01:03:29,426
No, I mean I'm serious,

921
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:34,394
you can't have money
define who you are.

922
01:03:37,123 --> 01:03:39,434
I mean, listen to me,
you can't have money

923
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:41,608
define who you are.

924
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,440
'Cause money...

925
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,269
Money makes you lazy.

926
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:49,962
The whole fucking world
can crumble around you

927
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,584
and you still don't make a move

928
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:53,484
because of all your
comfortable money.

929
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:56,108
It's like...

930
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,111
It's like comfortable glue.

931
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:01,907
Hm.

932
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,428
I used to sniff glue
in kindergarten.

933
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:11,537
Well, that explains a lot.

934
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,884
Yeah, it probably does.

935
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:27,829
I'm hungry.

936
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:43,636
These are really good.

937
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:45,743
- Mm-hm, more wine?
- Yes, please.

938
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:49,471
- Another oyster?
- Yeah, thank you.

939
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,818
Hey, did you see the
captain over there?

940
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,337
Yeah, nice hat.

941
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:56,960
Do you think he's peacocking?

942
01:04:56,962 --> 01:04:59,548
Well, actually, I think
he might be old school.

943
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,930
He might come over here
and pay for our lunch.

944
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:03,414
Okay.

945
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:05,004
Hi there, Captain,
how are you?

946
01:05:06,488 --> 01:05:08,974
Oh, well, hello.

947
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,253
Hi, you wanna join us?

948
01:05:13,564 --> 01:05:16,496
I'd love to, may
I buy you lunch?

949
01:05:16,498 --> 01:05:19,568
Oh, that would be
lovely, thank you.

950
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,640
And maybe after lunch,
we could have a drink.

951
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:24,642
On my boat.

952
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:26,748
- Oh, you have a boat!
- Oh, you have a boat!

953
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,925
- Sure.
- Yeah, that would be great.

954
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:31,030
Alright.

955
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:42,904
Bubbly.

956
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:48,875
Thank you.

957
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:51,980
Thank you.

958
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,397
- Top it off a little bit?
- Sure.

959
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:56,228
Why not?

960
01:05:57,229 --> 01:05:58,057
Thanks.

961
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,063
Cheers.

962
01:06:06,065 --> 01:06:07,547
Cheers.

963
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:08,378
Cheers.

964
01:06:17,076 --> 01:06:18,834
Should I put on some music?

965
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:21,149
You know, why don't
we just get naked?

966
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:27,811
Alright,

967
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,434
- yeah.
- Yeah.

968
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:45,449
Wow.

969
01:06:46,623 --> 01:06:48,381
Wow.

970
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:49,589
Nice.

971
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:06,505
Close your eyes.

972
01:07:11,096 --> 01:07:11,924
Mm.

973
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:16,789
Keep your eyes closed,
count from 10 to one

974
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:20,415
and imagine your wildest
dreams coming true.

975
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:22,797
Mm.

976
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:25,144
10,

977
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:28,285
nine...

978
01:07:31,116 --> 01:07:31,978
Seven...

979
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:34,634
Sex...

980
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:37,706
Uh, I mean six.

981
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:39,607
Five, four...

982
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:44,541
Hey, hey!

983
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:45,956
My hat!

984
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:48,271
Where are you going?

985
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,209
Hey!

986
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:57,452
My hat!

987
01:08:21,718 --> 01:08:22,958
Lena,

988
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:27,135
Please, come home now.

989
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:33,831
I know you don't wanna
talk to me but just...

990
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:39,115
Please, come home

991
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:47,190
After the
episode with the captain,

992
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:48,432
Lena developed an inkling

993
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:50,503
that their forlornness
was coming to and end.

994
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,988
She realized that
nothing had changed

995
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:55,232
and that she didn't
want change after all.

996
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:58,166
Meanwhile, Maria
was absorbing nature

997
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:00,513
and nature seemed to absorb her.

998
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:03,033
Life had always felt like
an abundance of opportunity,

999
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:04,759
too overwhelming
to make a choice.

1000
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:07,936
Now, nothing seemed
to matter anymore.

1001
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:14,320
The wide space made Lena
feel small and insignificant.

1002
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:16,667
She longed for the city
where everything had a system

1003
01:09:16,669 --> 01:09:17,808
and she knew her place.

1004
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:21,879
Maria, however, felt
at ease with herself.

1005
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:24,434
She felt like a part
of something bigger.

1006
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:26,712
And for the first
time in a long while,

1007
01:09:26,714 --> 01:09:28,334
she was happy and hopeful.

1008
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:55,915
Don't look.

1009
01:09:58,263 --> 01:09:59,227
Don't look.

1010
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:00,539
No, I'm not looking.

1011
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:01,816
Don't look, no cheating.

1012
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:04,681
Don't look.

1013
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:06,303
Okay, here we go, here we go,

1014
01:10:06,305 --> 01:10:09,168
- just one more step.
- Alright, here?

1015
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,377
There you go, and tada!

1016
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:12,930
You made fire!

1017
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:14,967
- I made fire!
- Wow!

1018
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:16,002
But that's not why we're here.

1019
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:18,557
- Why?
- We are here to do

1020
01:10:18,559 --> 01:10:20,492
a little burning ritual

1021
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,357
so you can free yourself.

1022
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:26,634
Okay, you ready?

1023
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:29,844
One, two, three.

1024
01:10:29,846 --> 01:10:31,054
Yay!

1025
01:10:33,712 --> 01:10:36,160
Okay, so free yourself, come on.

1026
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:38,128
Burn it, burn it,

1027
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,647
burn it, burn it, burn it,

1028
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:43,098
you have to free yourself,
free yourself, come on!

1029
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,205
Burn it, burn it,
burn it, burn it!

1030
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,210
Do it, do it, burn it, burn it!

1031
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:51,626
Yay!

1032
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,732
Okay, there's more, okay.

1033
01:11:00,152 --> 01:11:01,082
No, stop, stop!

1034
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:02,497
- One, two...
- Stop!

1035
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:03,328
What?

1036
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,849
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1037
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:10,438
What's wrong with you?

1038
01:11:11,508 --> 01:11:13,163
He never cheated on me.

1039
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:13,993
What?

1040
01:11:15,478 --> 01:11:17,065
He never cheated on me, okay?

1041
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:19,171
I made it up.

1042
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:23,762
He never has, he never will
be, it's just not who he is.

1043
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,354
Why would you do that?

1044
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:32,598
I don't know.

1045
01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:37,256
You don't know.

1046
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:38,121
I know why.

1047
01:11:39,778 --> 01:11:41,676
Because you're so
fucking ungrateful.

1048
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,818
You just like to play around
with people's feelings.

1049
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:50,304
You're so wise and you know
everything, you have everything.

1050
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,927
I fucking quit my
job because of you!

1051
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:56,931
Oh, don't put this on
me, you hated your job!

1052
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:58,657
What a dreamer you are.

1053
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:01,729
Always dream big and
then you get cold feet.

1054
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:02,663
What a rebel.

1055
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:05,595
You can never
commit to anything.

1056
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:08,358
Always on your fucking
phone, always withdrawn.

1057
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,051
You're so afraid.

1058
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:14,364
No, actually worse...

1059
01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:16,746
You're a coward.

1060
01:12:18,057 --> 01:12:18,886
I'm a coward?

1061
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:22,646
You're worse, you know why?

1062
01:12:22,648 --> 01:12:24,061
Because you destroy everything,

1063
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,961
you just like to destroy
everything because you're bored.

1064
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:29,135
You have everything, you
have the perfect life,

1065
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:30,965
the perfect husband,
the perfect marriage!

1066
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:32,932
You don't even know what
you're talking about, okay?

1067
01:12:32,934 --> 01:12:34,073
You're just jealous.

1068
01:12:36,455 --> 01:12:38,455
You wanna know how I feel?

1069
01:12:38,457 --> 01:12:40,148
You wanna know
how I really feel?

1070
01:12:42,496 --> 01:12:43,497
Fucking lost.

1071
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:48,879
Lost in this apartment, in
my marriage, in this world

1072
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:52,814
where people are killing each
other for religion, whatever.

1073
01:12:52,816 --> 01:12:54,333
And all of my shit?

1074
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:56,508
I can't do anything with it.

1075
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,612
Can I be a mother?

1076
01:12:57,614 --> 01:12:59,545
No. Can I make a difference?

1077
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:00,960
No. And it doesn't even matter

1078
01:13:00,962 --> 01:13:02,514
because people will
still kill each other

1079
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:05,208
and starve, and drown in oceans.

1080
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:07,624
And you know what?

1081
01:13:08,591 --> 01:13:09,764
No one,

1082
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:14,804
no one expects
anything of me anyway.

1083
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,775
So, it's all about you again.

1084
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,192
You are such an asshole.

1085
01:13:25,297 --> 01:13:29,264
You really are a
fucking spoiled bitch.

1086
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,068
- Fuck you.
- Maria,

1087
01:13:40,346 --> 01:13:41,175
Maria!

1088
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:12,998
Maria was
upset and confused.

1089
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,761
She couldn't believe
how naive she had been.

1090
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,249
At the same time, she felt
a strange sense of relief.

1091
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,635
Lena had the feeling
that this week

1092
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:31,432
actually had helped
them after all.

1093
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:34,847
That they had found
something together.

1094
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:38,679
A possibility of honesty,
a chance to accept.

1095
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:41,198
She was wondering
if Maria would agree

1096
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,477
and forgive her after all.

1097
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:56,559
Maybe, if she explained
herself one more time.

1098
01:15:19,655 --> 01:15:24,655
