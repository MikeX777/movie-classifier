1
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,428
Listen to this, Hank.

2
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:24,910
UGlobal Food Company triumphed
again in court last week

3
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,957
in its latest case
against a small farmer

4
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,874
accused of failing to pay
royalty on crops grown

5
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:34,529
using UGlobal's patented seeds.

6
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:39,534
Buck Thompson,
a local Hoxton farmer,

7
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:44,147
lost his lengthy legal
battle with UGlobal Foods

8
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:48,369
over his use of UGlobal's
patented soybean seeds.

9
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,721
Thompson was sued by the
giant agricultural company

10
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,462
for failure to pay royalties

11
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,117
on his crops grown
with the seeds.

12
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:02,687
UGlobal Food cannot
disprove Thompson's defense

13
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,124
that he had never bought any

14
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,430
of the agricultural
giant's seeds.

15
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,564
And the company had
no proof that he had.

16
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:13,481
But laboratory tests confirmed
that a portion of his crops

17
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:17,528
came from the seeds,
leaving the judge no choice

18
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,704
but to issue a directed verdict

19
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:23,055
against the long-time
Hoxton farmer.

20
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,625
And what's next?

21
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,324
I have to serve him
his eviction papers.

22
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:33,979
Easier from a friend, I hope.

23
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,158
When's it going to be?

24
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,639
A couple
of weeks, I guess.

25
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,293
Hell.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,209
What's the world coming to?

27
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,823
I'll see ya.

28
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,085
Daddy bear?

29
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,611
Daddy bear?

30
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,138
Here's my Daddy bear.

31
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,404
I love you.

32
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,624
I love you
too, Maisie May.

33
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,978
Daddy bear,
there's a man

34
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,719
on the phone who wants
to talk to you.

35
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,590
Okay, sweetie, thank you.

36
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,772
That was Hank.

37
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,341
They're coming this afternoon

38
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:34,692
with the eviction
papers, at two.

39
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:39,523
But... Maisie's party
is this afternoon.

40
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,873
I know it is.

41
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:46,661
Look, I'll deal with it
and send them on their way.

42
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,271
She'll never know.

43
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,318
Hello.

44
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,233
Hello, sweetheart.

45
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,671
Hello, honey, happy birthday.

46
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,065
We brought
you a surprise.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,024
Happy birthday.

48
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,766
- Louise.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,811
It's beautiful.

50
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,813
But you can't give
Maisie something so elegant.

51
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:10,467
She's just a little girl.

52
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,253
-Yes, she should.
-And I have, so there.

53
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,995
Gil bought it for me when
we found out we couldn't.

54
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:20,869
Yeah.

55
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,177
Anyway, it's yours.

56
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:27,658
Thank you.

57
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,313
- We love you.
- We love you too.

58
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,273
Go play.

59
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,537
Come on.

60
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,114
Look at that.

61
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,380
Itchy, can you give up that ball

62
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:56,600
long enough to have
some cake?

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,181
Hell, they're right on time.

64
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:20,189
Just take it easy. Don't
let 'em get you stirred up.

65
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,235
Maisie,
you have a haul.

66
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,674
Look at this.

67
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:35,247
He's got that fat
lawyer with him.

68
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:07,715
I... had it you wanted to send
one of the younger guys.

69
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,371
They ain't known you
your whole life like I have.

70
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,374
It didn't seem right.

71
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,553
I--God, Buck.

72
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,252
I hate that this
turned out like this.

73
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,085
I appreciate
your calling first.

74
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:34,437
Right in the middle of
a little girl's birthday.

75
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,006
'Cause of you?

76
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,661
You make me sick.

77
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,750
All of you make me sick.

78
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,621
Big company assholes.

79
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,584
It's hot.

80
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,326
Thompson, you had
a chance to settle.

81
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:55,937
And you didn't.

82
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,984
You no longer make
decisions about this land.

83
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,770
This now belongs to UGlobal.

84
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,251
We make the decisions now.

85
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,430
I make 'em.

86
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,610
You got two weeks
to be off this land.

87
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,831
I come back and
find a single trace.

88
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:24,008
He knows what the
court order says.

89
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,185
Get back in the vehicle.
Now, Mr. Gandy.

90
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,371
It's okay.

91
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,988
Happy birthday, little girl.

92
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:55,387
I bet this is one
you'll never forget.

93
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:57,302
Hey.

94
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,350
What did you say?

95
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,700
I said, "Happy--"

96
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,147
Somebody get a doctor.

97
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,888
Get off of me.

98
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,767
Kinsey to County.

99
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,073
Ambulance, Thompson place.

100
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,697
You listen to me, farmer boy.

101
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,263
Farmer boy!

102
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,093
Your suffering
hasn't even begun.

103
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,187
Hasn't even begun!

104
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,150

We do this every Friday.

141
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,931
Every Friday.

142
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,021
I mean, my God.

143
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,954
I gotta stop doing this.

144
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:39,655
But I can't.

145
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,756
And I repeat.

146
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:58,674
One more reason to
get out of here ASAFP.

147
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's go.

148
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,145
Hey, Daddy.

149
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,842
Kat, you got some
college stuff right there.

150
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,758
-Hi.
-Maisie.

151
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,936
How's my sweet Maisie?

152
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,769
So, what's the big plan tonight?

153
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,597
The usual.

154
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,947
Huge band downtown.

155
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:09,560
Then lots of hot new
guys who just moved here

156
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,389
with their rich parents
are going to be coming over

157
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,435
to stare at us and try to get us

158
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:18,352
to go driving around in
their new fancy foreign cars.

159
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,441
We may come home.

160
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:21,790
We may not.

161
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,835
Yeah. That is how we work.

162
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,577
So nothing.

163
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,927
No.

164
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,495
You know, I hate the
weekends when there's no game.

165
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,976
It makes for a long, long week.

166
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,457
There's nothing to
look forward to.

167
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,806
It's just--

168
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,416
I know.
So little hope.

169
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,420
- Yeah.
- So little reason to soldier on.

170
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,205
Have you ever
considered accepting

171
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,208
Jesus Christ as your
personal Lord and Savior?

172
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:52,777
You know,
I think I'd rather

173
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,780
create massive
uncountable wealth

174
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,870
by making really awesome
blue crystal meth,

175
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,047
killing all who get in my way,

176
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,180
and letting to money pile
so high that I can buy...

177
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,315
Well, whatever it is you buy
when you have a ton of money.

178
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,620
Who's with me?

179
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,761
You know who I am.

180
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,937
Say my name.

181
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,984
Say my name.

182
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,942
You're Heisenberg.

183
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:28,944
You're damn right.

184
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,296
I'm the cook.

185
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,823
Mom, how long is he going to
keep talking like Walter White?

186
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,435
Until Downton
Abbey picks up.

187
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,003
Then he'll become Mr. Carson.

188
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:08,810
That's a vehicle.

189
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,682
Yeah, that's a vehicle.

190
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,293
Damn.

191
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,816
Yes.

192
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,774
Yeah.

193
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,254
Let us pray.

194
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,693
Clint, I wish I hadn't
known you all my life.

195
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,086
What?

196
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,480
Then I'd let you
get at me a little

197
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,308
on the back of that monster.

198
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,397
Except it'd be like incest.

199
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,268
Well, a lot of people
who've known each other

200
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,836
-their whole lives--
-Nah, don't even go there.

201
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,533
You're like a brother to me.

202
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,666
It really creeps me out.

203
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,061
Man, what a truck.

204
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,279
Yeah.

205
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,369
-Friends.
-For life.

206
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,415
-In fun.
-And strife.

207
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:49,894
Six pals in Hoxton.

208
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,592
Livin' the life.

209
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,420
And...

210
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,205
♪ Hoxton how we're
Small and slow ♪

211
00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:00,035
♪ So drink the beer while
The beer's still cold ♪

212
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,258
The important thing is, is
that a little while longer

213
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,086
and we are all
getting out of here.

214
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,217
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

215
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,740
-Yeah.
-Woo.

216
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:10,741
Amen.

217
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,134
Cheers.

218
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:15,485
Hello.

219
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,359
I'm staying.

220
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,100
What?

221
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,538
I'm not
going to college.

222
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:25,756
What?

223
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,716
I know I'm in automatically
'cause of my grades.

224
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,761
But I'm not going.

225
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,024
I'm staying right
here in Hoxton.

226
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,026
Maisie, that's
not going to happen.

227
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,724
You're leaving with
the rest of us.

228
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,813
Nobody stays here, nobody.

229
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,684
Maisie, come on, you of all
people know that you're just--

230
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:44,819
All right, listen, Jesse,
you are a quarter Mexican

231
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,342
and three quarters Neanderthal.

232
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,170
So going off and
doing the Marines,

233
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,041
that's going to be
perfect for you.

234
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:54,307
Itchy, you are 100%
full-blooded Neanderthal,

235
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,222
have been since we were kids.

236
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,049
So you're going to end up being
a big college football star

237
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,356
and then make a ton
of money in the pros.

238
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,490
Lawton, you're going
to go to Princeton

239
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,406
and do whatever
smart people stuff

240
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,408
it is that people
at Princeton do.

241
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,889
And Clint, you're set 'cause
you got all that money

242
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,021
your dad gets
from the government

243
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,762
for not growing anything.

244
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,634
And Kat, you're going
to college and become

245
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:22,900
this Theta Omega Googa and
marry the hottest guy on campus,

246
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,902
have three perfect kids, okay?

247
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,514
And then there's me, you know?

248
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,084
My mom is an alcoholic who
can barely dress herself.

249
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,086
My brother is a mute,
walks around

250
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,089
in a robot costume
made out of boxes.

251
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,702
And for the win,
my dad's in prison.

252
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,921
I've got it all going on.

253
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,193
Look, I know I don't
have much left here,

254
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,195
except for you five.
And y'all are leaving.

255
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,805
And I know I should
get on with it.

256
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:02,766
But... I can't stand
the thought of leaving.

257
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,856
Too many people
been too good to me.

258
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,435
Miss Katherine.

259
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:23,744
Pretty Maisie.

260
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:28,705
Clint, Jesse, Lawton, Itchy.

261
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:33,057
One of you fellas hand me
a cold beer, would you?

262
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,016
Yeah, we got
plenty, Mr. Denton.

263
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,626
Yeah, I can see you do.

264
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,900
Dang, that was good.

265
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:54,209
I was really
thirsty.

266
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,691
Well, I owe ya.

267
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,346
I suppose you'll
all be here again

268
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,130
tomorrow night, as always.

269
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,218
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

270
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,480
-Yes, sir.
-Yep.

271
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,922
Idle hands are the
devil's workshop,

272
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:13,881
and all that business.

273
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,453
No game tonight.

274
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:26,110
God, I hate it when
there's no game.

275
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,418
See y'all.

276
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,132
All right, now can
someone please explain to me

277
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,613
why I'm only three
quarters Neanderthal.

278
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,746
And what the hell makes
Itchy here a whole one?

279
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,616
All right, that's bullshit, man.

280
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,490
That's bullshit, I don't really
appreciate that, I don't.

281
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,448
All right, you
need to calm down.

282
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,193
- My God.
- What is wrong with you?

283
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,156
I still remember how
many flowers there were

284
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,508
at Mrs. Denton's funeral,
and how worried my Dad was

285
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,597
that his eulogy wasn't
going to be good enough.

286
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:22,689
I remember as we were leaving,
Mr. Denton reached over

287
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,778
and touched the edge of
her coffin so gently,

288
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,562
like he was touching her.

289
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,042
I was so sad.

290
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,741
I can't believe one of the
widows hasn't grabbed him yet.

291
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,657
It's been three months.

292
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,833
Mom says they usually
wait a week out of respect

293
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,531
and then they pour it on

294
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,837
with the casseroles
and chicken spaghetti.

295
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,797
He's got all that money too.

296
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,407
What difference does it make

297
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,930
if you've got any
money in this town?

298
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,455
I mean, what are you
going to spend it on?

299
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,761
You don't need much to
live like a king here.

300
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,329
You got to stop
talking like that.

301
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:55,939
You're going to screw
me up in the head.

302
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,463
I'll wind up marrying someone

303
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,769
who wants to go
camping or something.

304
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,588
Your brother?

305
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,677
Same as always,
in his own world.

306
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,243
Your mom?

307
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,812
You know how she is.
Why even ask?

308
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,946
You give them both my love.

309
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,556
I always do.

310
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,082
I haven't told Buckie
you're getting out in April.

311
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,042
He doesn't respond too much
in general these days.

312
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,000
And if he does, he doesn't
talk to me about it,

313
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,046
or anyone else as far as I know.

314
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,484
You keep an eye on
him for me, Maisie.

315
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,096
How are your friends?

316
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,752
Same.
Clint got a new truck.

317
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,450
Duh.

318
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,800
And Mr. Denton joined us
while we were drinking beer

319
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,715
on Main Street last night.

320
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,283
He seems real lonely.

321
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,765
I guess he is.
It hasn't been that long.

322
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,420
He's going to help
me when I get out.

323
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,117
What?

324
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,946
I got a letter from him
earlier this week.

325
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,252
What'd it say?

326
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,123
Classic Gil Denton.

327
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,039
"Buck, I want you to take over

328
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,302
my operation when you get out."

329
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,913
Dad, my God, my God.

330
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,567
Are you serious?

331
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,133
My God, this is
the best news ever.

332
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,527
I'm going to start
looking for a house.

333
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,137
I'm going to start looking.

334
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:48,530
And it's going to be
just like it was--

335
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,098
No, no, no, no, no, Maisie.

336
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,058
Nothing is ever going to
be like it was before.

337
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,108
Nothing is ever even going to
be like how we remember it.

338
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,200
You're going off to college
and getting a new start.

339
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,811
And you have to go.

340
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,207
I won't be able to
do much but work

341
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,339
and try to get some
money saved up.

342
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,560
I want to take care of your mom.

343
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,607
And we need to get
little Buckie some help.

344
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,915
Maybe it'll work out
and maybe it won't.

345
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:30,485
But I'll be an ex-con.

346
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,880
And you need to get a new start

347
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:37,753
in a fresh place... where
you're not my daughter.

348
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:41,757
Dad, you are Buck Thompson.

349
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,977
You hammered a
UGlobal Food lawyer.

350
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:45,892
You're like our King Carter.

351
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,198
Except you did it and he didn't.

352
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,330
But anyway, you
know what I mean.

353
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,899
The point is, you're
like a cult hero.

354
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:54,944
You know, you should
have your own website.

355
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,859
I bet if you were on
Facebook you'd get

356
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:00,080
like a jillion likes,
and you'd rule Instagram.

357
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,690
Hey, Maisie.

358
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,911
Buck, time's almost up.

359
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,437
You're my hero, Dad.

360
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:12,222
You're
my precious angel.

361
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,226
I love you, Daddy bear.

362
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,968

Maisie, come over here.
I want you to see this.

377
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:04,683
I'm sitting in my
yard swaying out here

378
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:08,643
in the tiny town of
Hoxton, and I'm reading

379
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:12,995
this morning's edition of the  New York Timeson this device

380
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,912
that I have no idea how
in the world it works.

381
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,349
And then I'm going to
read a British newspaper

382
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:23,527
and it's going to hone my
worldly and polished ways.

383
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:25,529
And then I'll go to sports.

384
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,968
And after that, I'm going
to follow the weather

385
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:32,536
all across this
great land of ours.

386
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,800
All on this little device.

387
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:37,672
How can that be possible,

388
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,284
this little gizmo holding
all that information?

389
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:46,115
Of course, I don't even
understand how a radio works.

390
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,422
And air conditioning puzzles me

391
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:52,295
if I kind of let my mind
wander a little bit.

392
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:55,124
Television, I got
no idea about that.

393
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,823
Magnets.

394
00:28:57,997 --> 00:29:00,739
The list goes on,
and on, and on.

395
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,655
And then this thing.

396
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,484
You have no idea what this world

397
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,704
was like when I was your age.

398
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:15,014
We used to talk to each
other face to face.

399
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:21,150
We'd write letters on
paper with ink pens.

400
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:25,851
We did our own cooking.

401
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:27,766
We would...

402
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,943
We only had two kinds of gasoline.

403
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:34,163
We had regular and
ethyl, that was it.

404
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,300
And then in the evening
we would sit on the porch

405
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,607
and visit with our neighbors.

406
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,262
Did you have to hit Mrs.
Denton over the head with a club

407
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,221
and drag her into the house too?

408
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,266
On occasion.

409
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,619
Have you seen your
mama this week?

410
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,012
Yes, sir.

411
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,363
How's your
daddy doing today?

412
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,453
Finally, thank God.
He's good.

413
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,282
He told me what you're going
to do for him when he gets out.

414
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:09,503
You can't believe anything
that they say in prison.

415
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:12,723
You know those criminals are
always just after attention.

416
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,203
Mr. Denton, I--

417
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,207
You don't know what this means.

418
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,645
You don't-- It means
he's going to be okay.

419
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,299
It means I'm going to be okay.

420
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,171
It means we're going to
be all right, and I--

421
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,825
Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

422
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,782
Okay.

423
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,001
You know--

424
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,309
Your daddy... destroyed

425
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:38,010
a UGlobal lawyer with one blow.

426
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,274
He hit him and he took him out.

427
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:45,191
Now, with what these
big corporations

428
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:49,282
are trying to do to us
now, to have one man

429
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:52,894
have the courage to stand
up to the representative

430
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:56,811
of one of those things
and take him out...

431
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:03,252
I mean, that restores
my faith in human nature.

432
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,560
It strengthened my faith in God.

433
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,130
And I cannot imagine
a person that I'd rather

434
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:14,524
have running my
operation than your dad.

435
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,832
That's the truth.

436
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,058
We'll be on Main Street tonight.

437
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,191
There'll be lots of cold beer.

438
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,324
I hope I see you there.

439
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,021
I'll be there.

440
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,806
And cookies, I
brought you cookies.

441
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,547
Well, I wouldn't ignore them.

442
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,028
That'd be my supper.

443
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:49,124
Mr. Denton...
All the guys want

444
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,300
to grow up to be just like you.

445
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,350
Well I can't think of a better
aspiration for a young fella.

446
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:01,571
I hope he can hold it together
to become a tired old man.

447
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:06,925
I don't blame 'em,
I really don't.

448
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,031
Hey, Lawton, what's up?

449
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:28,642
Hey. Is Kat up yet?

450
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:31,123
Please.

451
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,256
Kat, get up, Lawton's here!

452
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:51,186
Mom wants to interview
us for the paper.

453
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,275
She wants to talk
about how the six of us

454
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,234
have been best friends
since we were kids

455
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,976
and some of the cool
things we've done so far.

456
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:02,632
Like Mr. Hoxton High,
National Merit Scholar,

457
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,895
Division One
football scholarship,

458
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,202
and you know, Marine.

459
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,683
As well as the two
head cheerleaders

460
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:12,729
that are class president
and class favorite.

461
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,950
So it's like, mainly
about me and Maisie, right?

462
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:18,909
It's mainly about
the six of us.

463
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,434
Whatever.

464
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:26,526
She wants to talk
about how you've dealt

465
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,183
with your dad being in prison,
if that's okay to talk about.

466
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,185
What?

467
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,491
You want to let everybody
know my dad's in prison?

468
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:36,492
Wait till this gets out.

469
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,277
I'll be ruined.

470
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,627
She, look, she can leave
it out if you want her to.

471
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:43,108
She just wanted me to ask.

472
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,893
You know, she thought
she ought to talk about

473
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,851
how you've been
able to do so much

474
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,550
despite that, and all that.

475
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:52,291
It's okay, I know.

476
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,643
Did anyone ever tell you
you're like, super serious?

477
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:03,867
Ninth grade's when I guess
I got pretty good at football.

478
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,219
But I just figured I was
quicker and that's all.

479
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,525
Then my sophomore year
when all the scouts

480
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,484
started watching me
my parents said that,

481
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,747
you know, maybe
they knew something.

482
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,705
And now that I'm going
off to college to play,

483
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,012
I guess I'll find out
if I'm the stud horse

484
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:19,796
they keep telling me I am.

485
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,060
Wouldn't
that be something

486
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:25,106
if one day you play
professional football?

487
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,760
I hope I do.

488
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:27,891
I'd like to be the
first guy from Hoxton

489
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,241
to make it in the pros.

490
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,981
- I
- bet a lot of people

491
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,853
would come to the
Mexican restaurant

492
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:36,161
and the bowling alley just
to say they'd been there.

493
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,293
I bet every family in
the area would want

494
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,861
to be buried by your
family's funeral home.

495
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,081
Well, I'd like to
think that we wouldn't

496
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,300
have to keep all three of those.

497
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,041
I'd like to be able
to help my parents

498
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,174
so they wouldn't
have to work so much.

499
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,567
I hope you
don't close the restaurant.

500
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,352
I love that guacamole.

501
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,834
And better not
close that bowling alley.

502
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,272
I ain't driving
to Maston to bowl.

503
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,754
I guess the main
thing is I'll always be

504
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:08,628
a Hoxton boy in my heart,
even if I live somewhere else.

505
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:10,978
You'd have
to live someplace else

506
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,154
if you play
professional football.

507
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:14,938
Yeah, I know that.

508
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,680
I might even wind
up having to stay

509
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:20,683
somewhere afterwards for a
while, like lots of guys do.

510
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,774
But I guess if I had
my dreams come true

511
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:29,649
I'd do well in college, get
drafted, play in the pros,

512
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:32,478
then come back here
and coach our team.

513
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,001
That'd be cool.

514
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,655
And Coach would
probably be about

515
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,613
ready to retire by that time.

516
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,399
It'd sure be
nice to have somebody

517
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,444
over there coaching
that would listen to me.

518
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:54,195
Tommy, we're
up here on the porch.

519
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:01,463
Montecristo No. 4s,
from the motherland.

520
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:04,727
Look at this.

521
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,382
Tobacco contraband.

522
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:10,385
I hope we don't all wind
up in the penitentiary.

523
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:14,694
Oo-ee.

524
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:24,486
Tommy... Gil has cancer.

525
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:32,190
It's a rare form of bone
cancer, but it's serious.

526
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,194
Doctors in Houston diagnosed it,

527
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:40,328
and... I'm going to do
what I can for the pain.

528
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:49,685
But if we don't catch a
break, he's got about a year.

529
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:56,344
You're the only other person
that knows about this, okay?

530
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,519
Okay.

531
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:09,836
Tommy, I invited Kline
here to explain this to you

532
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:15,233
because he's my doctor, and
you, you're my brother in law.

533
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:21,978
At least, you were my brother
in law until Louise, well.

534
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,850
Well...

535
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:27,201
That meant I still think of
you as my brother in law.

536
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,029
Right, yeah.

537
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:33,338
Now, I want you to be
the executor of my estate,

538
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:37,080
make sure all the
transition goes smoothly

539
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,084
when Buck gets out of
prison and it's time for him

540
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,349
to take over if I'm
already, you know.

541
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,963
But any questions that you
might have of a medical nature,

542
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:54,315
or anything else, just feel
free to ask either one of us.

543
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,239
Can I have your golf clubs?

544
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,781
Golf clubs.

545
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,271
Damn, Tommy.

546
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:41,623
Golf clubs.

547
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,627
Yes, Mom.

548
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,238
I remember what all I'm
supposed to talk about.

549
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:56,334
I never thought I'd get
into Princeton, not really.

550
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,988
I applied because I
thought it'd be cool

551
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:01,251
to go to an Ivy League school.

552
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:04,254
They told me that they've
never ever had anyone

553
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,736
from Hoxton before,
so I'm proud of that.

554
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,478
You're proud of that?

555
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,350
Your dad and I are so
proud of you, sweetie.

556
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:16,049
I always knew you could do
anything you wanted to do.

557
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:18,704
Okay, Mom, thanks.

558
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,532
Please.

559
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,495
I think I got a good
education here in Hoxton.

560
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,240
I was taught good values,
hard work, honesty.

561
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,808
I think Princeton liked that.

562
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,376
And my test scores.

563
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,423
Dad said too that he
wishes he had gone

564
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:46,732
somewhere else for college,
so I also did it for him.

565
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,213
Maybe we could practice
law together one day,

566
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,172
if I go to law school.

567
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:53,869
My God, Lawton,

568
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,784
that would just be perfect.

569
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,308
We would both be tickled pink.

570
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,790
But I don't know if I
want to come back here, Mom.

571
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,488
And I don't want
to be pressured.

572
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:06,273
I hate it when you
pressure me like that.

573
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,145
Anyway...

574
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:15,238
I think being from
Hoxton made me stand out.

575
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:19,765
'Cause I was probably
a little more normal

576
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,594
than some of the other kids
who want to go up there.

577
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:25,248
And I'll come out normal too.

578
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:30,166
I won't be some
radical East Coast kid.

579
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,607
I-- I won't come out with
a lot of weird ideas.

580
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,653
And I won't be one of
those people who only cares

581
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:42,440
about the money and acting
like a big shot, and all that.

582
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,355
I'll still be one of us.

583
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,359
Lord.

584
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,017
Kline, I can barely
stand up on my own now.

585
00:40:56,062 --> 00:41:01,023
The pain pills are all
right, but I don't know.

586
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:04,331
A man's no good alone, Kline.

587
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,637
You know that.

588
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,597
The only person I
want to be with now

589
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,991
is Louise, and she's not here.

590
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:17,823
So I'm ready to follow
God's timetable.

591
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,739
And it's--
It's time.

592
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:26,701
Without the chemo
you may last a year,

593
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,965
but the end is going
to be miserable.

594
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:35,101
Just-- Just do the damn chemo
and let's see what happens.

595
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,452
Do it for me and Tommy.

596
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,802
Do it for Buck.

597
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:44,980
Do it for Maisie.

598
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,982
Damn it, Kline,
that's not fair.

599
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,682
You know I'd cut off my
right arm for that girl.

600
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:01,431
All right.

601
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:03,390
I'm going to
pick you up at nine.

602
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,218
We'll go to the medical center.

603
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,915
I'll have you back by
supper time, you hear me?

604
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,961
Okay, I'll do it.

605
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:12,399
But I want that to
be powerful stuff.

606
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,967
- I want it to pack a wallop.
- Okay.

607
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,143
If I take a piss
outdoors I want it

608
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,753
to kill every flea on every dog

609
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,712
between here and
Denbury, you hear me?

610
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,105
See, I'm not a big one
on paying for something

611
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,325
to make me puke my
guts out every morning

612
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,283
and have it not do any good.

613
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:28,546
That's just me though.

614
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,199
Now hear me out.

615
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,984
There are things you can
do now to ease that issue,

616
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:34,987
like anti-nausea
medication's pretty good.

617
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:39,861
And there's some
non-traditional alternatives.

618
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,384
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

619
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,386
Now I ain't
going to take yoga.

620
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,954
I'm not referring to yoga.

621
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:48,304
I'm talking about marijuana.

622
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:53,005
I'm not
some damn musician.

623
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,529
And I don't relish
the idea of spending

624
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,139
my last days in
the penitentiary.

625
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,620
What in the hell is the
matter with you, Kline?

626
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:00,969
Nothing.

627
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:04,277
It helped me when I was
getting over that foot surgery.

628
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:09,412
My best friend,
a damn dope fiend.

629
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:21,250
What-- What's it like?

630
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,862
You'll like it.

631
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:26,081
I guarantee it, okay?

632
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,649
Well, it ain't
going to turn me

633
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,433
into Charles Manson, is it?

634
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,089
He was a family man.

635
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:35,047

Well, it's
a beautiful September night

649
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:46,422
in Hoxton.

650
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,555
But with no game there's
really nothing to do

651
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:51,036
but listen to your old
Uncle Bud on the radio.

652
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,386
The weather is what is
always is this time of year.

653
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,518
And whatever happened
in Washington, well,

654
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,868
it'll just make you sick.

655
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,826
So let's just skip it.

656
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:06,094
So, just light it
like regular tobacco.

657
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:11,317
Take a little in your lungs,
and hold it before you exhale.

658
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:15,756
If I start thrashing around
or pulling my clothes off,

659
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,367
you all gotta
promise to stop me.

660
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,153
It he's naked and
starts thrashing around,

661
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:23,721
I'm gonna have to
let you take over.

662
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,726
Good practice today.

663
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:30,466
Yep.

664
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:37,343
Hey man, sorry about
that hit on the last sweep.

665
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,738
I just--
I'm still just so pissed

666
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:43,392
about Ashley
breaking up with me.

667
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:45,046
And apparently
she's been going out

668
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,353
with this new guy from
Maston all places.

669
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,138
And I was just dwelling on
it and it made me go psycho.

670
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:51,836
No wait, that last play?

671
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,229
Where I ran it all
the way, you hit me?

672
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:55,840
Yeah, I did.

673
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:57,319
Douche.

674
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,018
Hey man.

675
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,628
You know, that guy's
got a lot of nerve.

676
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,282
A guy from Maston going
after one of our women.

677
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,544
Right.

678
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:05,980
-Yeah.
-Wait, who is he?

679
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,114
Wilkins, their
pussy quarterback.

680
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:13,945
Apparently he's real smart,
he's got a whole lot of money.

681
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,251
He's this big jock,
so they all decided

682
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:19,515
to make him president of
their sorry senior class.

683
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,475
Captain of their
bullshit football team.

684
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:25,739
Captain of their
chickenshit basketball team.

685
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,308
And all-star pitcher of their
half-assed baseball team.

686
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:31,614
Wait, is this the same teams
that beat our asses last year?

687
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,486
-Well.
-Yeah.

688
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:37,533
Well-- I'm just saying, I am our
goddamn middle linebacker.

689
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:38,752
- Damn right.
- I'm one of the most

690
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:40,145
dependable basketball players.

691
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,624
Yep, yep, yep.

692
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,148
And I am the
best-hitting catcher

693
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,193
that our team has ever had.

694
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:49,458
I mean, seriously, what does
this guy have that I don't?

695
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:56,030
Ashley.

696
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:57,118
- We're sorry.
- Come on.

697
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:58,337
You know we're messing.

698
00:46:58,511 --> 00:46:59,773
-Come on.
-Come on.

699
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:12,481
♪ Never be like that ♪

700
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,429
Well...

701
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,304
my family's been
farming here for over 100 years.

702
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:57,178
So I like to think
that's pretty cool.

703
00:47:57,787 --> 00:48:00,399
But
they don't farm anymore.

704
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:06,057
Well it's more profitable
to not farm sometimes,

705
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:08,189
take the deal from
the government.

706
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:11,279
But I really don't know
anything about this.

707
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,325
I mean, it doesn't
make much sense to me.

708
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:18,852
But anyways, I'll
either stay here,

709
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:22,856
learn the family business,
or I'm off to college.

710
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:26,207
What?
You might stay here?

711
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,209
Lawton never told me that.

712
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,257
Well, I doubt it.

713
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:36,478
See, this is how I live my life.

714
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:42,049
Every day that goes by
that I'm not learning

715
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:45,313
about my dad's business is a
day that I'll never get back.

716
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,883
And, you know, I don't like
to let things slip away.

717
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:55,323
So, that's why I'll be happy
to be voted Mr. Hoxton High.

718
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,676
So, so you're proud

719
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,375
of being Mr. Hoxton High?

720
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:05,594
Yes, ma'am.

721
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:10,817
I hope to always uphold the
things the honor stands for.

722
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:15,561
I think my mom would
be proud of me.

723
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:18,520
Clint, she's up there

724
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:20,914
smiling down on you right now.

725
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:24,831
Yeah, I like to think so.

726
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,441
I know so.

727
00:49:26,615 --> 00:49:29,009
And she always will
be, you know that.

728
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:34,101
So, what are
those things, Clint,

729
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:37,148
the ones that mean
the most to you?

730
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,110
Well--

731
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,985
I don't think
I know what they are.

732
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:50,857
Maybe they forgot to tell me.

733
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,033
I just--

734
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:57,951
I just know I believe
in 'em and I always will.

735
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:06,742
Robert Buckner Thompson,
you have served

736
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,223
almost all of your
ten-year sentence.

737
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:13,010
You're scheduled for release
April 30th of next year.

738
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,186
Yes, sir.

739
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,843
Your actions had such
terrible consequences.

740
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,630
Although your victim sustained
his most serious injuries

741
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:29,852
when he fell, it was your attack
that set events in motion.

742
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:32,855
Had it not been for the
quick actions of the sheriff,

743
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,207
sheriff... Sheriff Kinsey,

744
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,645
you'd most likely be serving

745
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:44,476
a term for murder instead
of attempted murder.

746
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:50,525
Now we have reviewed
your case and reports

747
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,745
from the officials
of this prison.

748
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:56,357
Early release is denied.

749
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,012
You'll serve out
your full sentence

750
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,058
until April 30th of next year.

751
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,758
Yes, sir.

752
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:19,119
Ten years.

753
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,818
Ten years, my God.

754
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:24,951
I'm eight when he goes away.

755
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,953
He misses seeing everything.

756
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:30,174
Even though he was
locked up in that joint

757
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:33,568
he was still there for you...

758
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,355
talking to you... listening.

759
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:41,315
He was a good dad to you.

760
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:53,588
I get so mad at him
sometimes, doing what he did.

761
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,331
For being locked
up, for being away

762
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:59,159
from all of us for so long.

763
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:07,385
A man can only take
so much before he snaps.

764
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:15,915
Your dad worked that land
for ten years by himself...

765
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:21,355
improving it, making it
better than what he inherited.

766
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:26,273
And all of a sudden he's sued...

767
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:32,323
for raising a crop
that he didn't plant.

768
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:37,893
And unlike all
these other people,

769
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:42,115
he... he refused
to cave in to the...

770
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:46,467
piss poor settlement offer

771
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,601
that UGlobal made...

772
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:52,952
and decided to fight 'em.

773
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:57,870
He couldn't win.

774
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:02,962
This country's being
run by big corporations,

775
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,227
big politicians, big business.

776
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:15,496
All this about the
little man, small farmer...

777
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:24,026
It's just so much
finely sifted... horseshit.

778
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:31,643
Your dad, me...

779
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:34,689
a few others like us...

780
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:40,217
we're the old way,
on our way out.

781
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,699
Some day the teachers in
school will be talking

782
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:49,269
about how the small
farmer raised his family...

783
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:55,623
fed 'em on crops from his own
farm, and sold the surplus.

784
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:04,328
And it will seem as
amusing to those kids

785
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:08,767
as when I talk to you about
black and white television.

786
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:16,775
Thanks for helping me
get through all this.

787
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:24,043
I know it was you who
helped out me and Buckie.

788
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:27,089
I know it was you who
tried to help my mom.

789
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,178
My dad told me.

790
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:33,444
I told
you not to listen

791
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,272
to what you hear in prison.

792
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:40,189
Your dad's a violent
criminal, not to be trusted.

793
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:41,365
I know.

794
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,021
I brought you some more of
those oatmeal raisin cookies.

795
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:47,632
I'm a leave them in
the kitchen, all right?

796
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:50,287
I'll eat 'em all in
one sitting tonight.

It's
a cool 55 degrees,

809
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:14,632
but it's a miserable
night here in Hoxton.

810
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,764
The Warriors, they
lost a tough battle

811
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,723
to bitter rival, Maston.

812
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:20,855
And they lost on just a
terrible call by the refs

813
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:23,945
who basically gave
the game to Maston,

814
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,035
stealing a game from Hoxton
and ruining the senior year

815
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:29,777
of a bunch of great
kids who don't deserve

816
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,998
to have their life's dreams
crushed by a group of zebras

817
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:36,175
clearly, clearly
bought and paid for

818
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:39,439
by someone who doesn't give a damn about good sportsmanship.

819
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:42,660
No other news is
worth talking about.

820
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,491
I can't believe I just played

821
00:56:47,665 --> 00:56:49,101
my last game of
football for Hoxton.

822
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,669
I can't stand that
we lost our last game.

823
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,714
Man, that was
the dirtiest team

824
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:55,934
I have ever played against.

825
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,897
Last game at Hoxton,
my best friends...

826
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:06,074
drinking beer on Main Street.

827
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:10,557
I can start crying
pretty easily,

828
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,907
or write a country
and western song.

829
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:26,921
I don't know what
that other team

830
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,358
did to y'all on
that field tonight.

831
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,928
Well, at least they
didn't waterboard ya.

832
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:36,409
Yeah, well that's the only
thing they didn't do to us.

833
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:37,802
No, I'm good.

834
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,416
You ought to be happy
they don't eat the dead.

835
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,640
Well, I guess there's
more important things

836
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:53,687
than caring about what
your football team does.

837
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,779
But not here in Hoxton,
not any other small town.

838
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,479
Somewhere, I reckon.

839
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:12,184
You all... cherish
these moments...

840
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:16,884
'cause one day down the road...

841
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:23,325
you're going to wish you had
thousands of other Fridays

842
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,200
that you could sit and have
a beer with your friends,

843
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,508
shoot the breeze and...

844
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:40,604
Good night, y'all.

845
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,518
Mr. Denton's dying.

846
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,348
Wait, what?

847
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:31,959
Where'd you hear that?

848
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,572
No, no, that can't be right.

849
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,138
He was just at the game.

850
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:39,184
He looked fine.

851
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,535
Look, I saw his chemo schedule
on his refrigerator door.

852
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:44,145
Don't say shit like that.

853
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,757
That must be why
he's hiring my dad.

854
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,674
He spends a lot of time
out on the porch now.

855
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:52,371
I can see him from the highway

856
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:54,808
every time I drive by,
no matter what time.

857
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,811
He's just out there
smoking his pipe.

858
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:03,556
Shit.

859
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:05,776
That must be it.

860
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,169
My mom said every lady in
town's been trying to get him

861
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:11,042
to come over for dinner,
but he turns them all down.

862
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:17,831
Look, I'm not
supposed to know.

863
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,965
If he wants to tell
anyone, he can.

864
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:24,316
But we can't, okay?

865
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:36,807
My granddad was a Marine
and my dad was a Marine.

866
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:40,724
And, of course, he's a sheriff.

867
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:43,901
And I'm going to be a Marine.

868
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,165
And I'll tell you,
that's not because

869
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,080
that's what's expected of me.

870
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:50,559
No.

871
01:00:51,473 --> 01:00:53,171
That's because
that's what I want.

872
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,609
So if you look at
the news you'll see

873
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,437
they're always listing the names

874
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:00,526
of the different guys that
were killed in action.

875
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,572
It's usually small town guys.

876
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:07,359
I think that small town
guys love this country more.

877
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,536
And I think they love it
because of their hometowns.

878
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,451
I think that's the
reason they sign up.

879
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:17,021
And I think if they
were, you know,

880
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:20,546
all from some big
city, I don't know

881
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,635
if they'd love their
country as much as they do.

882
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:26,987
That's
so sweet, Jesse.

883
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,380
My goodness.

884
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:33,254
Thank you, thank you.

885
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:34,691
Are you okay?

886
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:41,610
I'm real sorry about
your, you know, cancer.

887
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:44,483
It's okay.
Don't you worry about that.

888
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,137
I'm fighting it.

889
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:47,704
Yeah, well.

890
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:49,923
It sure seems to
be going around.

891
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,408
Man, I love my country so much.

892
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,716
I love it so much, I really do.

893
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,936
I think I made that
pretty obvious.

894
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:07,462
So, you know, if I'm--

895
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:11,466
If I'm stuck up
in some lousy place, right?

896
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,253
And I'm getting shot at,
I'm going to be doing it

897
01:02:15,427 --> 01:02:17,168
because I love my country.

898
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,084
And even more than that,
I'm going to be doing that

899
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:22,173
because I love
Hoxton, and because

900
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:24,349
I love my friends
and my family here.

901
01:02:25,176 --> 01:02:27,874
And because they are something

902
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,833
that's really
worth fighting for.

903
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,055
Plus, you know, us Mexicans
are real ass kickers too.

904
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:39,277
Yeah, excuse my language.

905
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:42,671
But you're just
one quarter Mexican, Jesse.

906
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:44,586
Hey okay, even
a quarter Mexican

907
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,502
is still enough to kick
most people's asses.

908
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,550
Look, we made tequila
out of a cactus.

909
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,160
You don't jack with somebody

910
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:55,032
that does something like
that, I'm just saying.

911
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:02,779
Happy,
happy New Year

912
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,737
to everyone on this
cold and frosty night.

913
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:06,695
Now you need to drive carefully

914
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,349
because drinking and
driving doesn't end well.

915
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:10,351
Well, unless you
have a good lawyer

916
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,789
or you're related to the
cop that pulls you over.

917
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:39,772
Slow down.

918
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,907
My God, not so fast please.

919
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:53,655
Wow.

920
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:07,017
You promised me you'd
look in on her every week.

921
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,933
What's the point, Dad?

922
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,980
Seriously, what's the point?

923
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:17,288
She's never once been awake
when I've come by there.

924
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:19,464
Don't go by so early.

925
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:21,596
Dad, she is a drunk, okay?

926
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,076
She's a drunk.

927
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,035
She doesn't wake
up for anything.

928
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:29,778
Maisie, please don't talk
that way about your mother.

929
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:36,394
Dad, you're the one that's
been there for me, not her.

930
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:40,615
Honey, it is not her fault.

931
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,052
It's my fault she's like this.

932
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:43,575
I could have given up.

933
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:45,707
I could have.

934
01:04:46,143 --> 01:04:47,622
It would have been
real easy for me

935
01:04:47,796 --> 01:04:50,103
to just leave, or
give up, or whatever.

936
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:51,931
But I didn't, and
I stayed around.

937
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:53,802
I took care of Buckie
when she started drinking.

938
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,588
And I have been here
every visitors day

939
01:04:56,762 --> 01:04:58,546
for the last ten years.

940
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:04,596
I don't expect
you to understand

941
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,120
everything at your young age.

942
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:09,427
I sure didn't.

943
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,736
I'm pretty grown up, Dad.

944
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:17,652
You're smarter than I was.

945
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:19,785
All of ya are.

946
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,789
But that doesn't
make you any wiser.

947
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:28,228
I go to bed every
night knowing my family

948
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,535
is split up and suffering.

949
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:35,061
I could blame that lawsuit

950
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,716
and be bitter the
rest of my life.

951
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:42,547
I could blame my hot temper

952
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:45,724
and never forgive myself
for going after Gandy.

953
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:52,557
Or I could take it like
a piece of bad luck...

954
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:56,996
and work through it
and let it go.

955
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,957
Which is what I aim to do.

956
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:07,572
I was never a threat to anyone.

957
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:11,837
I was a farmer.

958
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,625
I was just a farmer.

959
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:37,515
How was your Dad?

960
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,300
Still the best guy I know.

961
01:06:40,474 --> 01:06:41,475
Yeah.

962
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:44,304
Was he hung-over?

963
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:45,914
He's in prison.

964
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:50,919
They don't party much, so
he never has a hangover.

965
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,923
Well, he's got
that going for him.

966
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,056
Which is nice.

967
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:00,016
Here, drink it.

968
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,323
You gotta take it.

969
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:08,372
Come on.

970
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:09,764
You watch it.

971
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:14,987
♪ Days grow shorter
As the months go by ♪

972
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:18,556
♪ Summer and the autumn skies ♪

973
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:28,914
Talked to that
doctor in Houston.

974
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,221
What?

975
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:35,703
Told him to hit me
with everything he had.

976
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:39,620
He said it might kill me.

977
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:43,059
I said, so be it.

978
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:52,242
Buck's going to be taking
over this place pretty soon.

979
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:58,683
There's a lot of things
that I want to get done.

980
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:08,606
This cancer may kill me,
but it's going to take

981
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,087
a hell of a licking doing it.

982
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,265
I'm going to fight it.

983
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:19,573
Maisie's taking too
good a care of me...

984
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:23,838
for me to say goodbye
to her now.

985
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,715
I'm worried
about you getting weak...

986
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:35,285
all this nausea.

987
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:54,695
- How much weed is that?
- All of it.

988
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:02,268
Kat.

989
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,272
It's an
interview for the newspaper.

990
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,537
It's not a video.

991
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,974
I know.

992
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:17,196
I knew that. I mean, duh.

993
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:27,641
So, what does it mean
to be from Hoxton?

994
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,993
What does it mean to
be head cheerleader

995
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,909
at Hoxton High School,
home of the Warriors?

996
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:39,740
I have thought about it.

997
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,916
And I'll tell you what it means.

998
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:47,139
It means...

999
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,754
It means...

1000
01:09:58,803 --> 01:09:59,978
It means a lot.

1001
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:02,894
And I mean that.

1002
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,767
It means a lot.

1003
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,077
That's four words.

1004
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:17,648
Can you
think of more things to say

1005
01:10:17,822 --> 01:10:20,085
about what it means
to be from Hoxton

1006
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,348
and to be head cheerleader,
and all of that?

1007
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:24,959
So far all you've said
is those four words.

1008
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,920
I've never known
you to only say four words.

1009
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:30,400
More?

1010
01:10:30,574 --> 01:10:32,402
Yes, more.

1011
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:39,452
In case it goes into a time
capsule, or gets discovered

1012
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:42,803
by archeologists thousands
of years from now.

1013
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:48,418
Okay, wow, I hadn't
thought about that.

1014
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:49,984
Um--

1015
01:10:56,861 --> 01:10:57,949
Okay.

1016
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:02,997
Well...

1017
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:10,875
It means
I got to grow up

1018
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,746
with some of the best
people in the world.

1019
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:18,404
It means I got to grow up with
the best guys I'll ever know.

1020
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:22,103
And I got to grow
up with Maisie,

1021
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,933
who's... the best friend
anyone could ever ask for.

1022
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:38,163
And I know that... no matter
what happens to me,

1023
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:42,907
or... where I end up,
or who I wind up with...

1024
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:48,304
if there's anything in me
that will make people like me

1025
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:50,610
or want to get to know me...

1026
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:55,354
it'll be because
I'm from Hoxton.

1027
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,622
And no one else could
ever understand that

1028
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:07,758
because... no one else's
hometown is as great as ours is.

1029
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,546
They may think it
is, but it's not.

1030
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,216
Hey, Buckie.

1031
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:38,919
Are you hungry?

1032
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,271
My gosh, this looks so good.

1033
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,544
Excuse me, sweetie.

1034
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,592
How's your day?

1035
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,575
Maisie.

1036
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,186
Yeah?

1037
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,146
You wanna talk?

1038
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:17,104
Sure.

1039
01:14:35,122 --> 01:14:36,123
Look...

1040
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,910
You've had more
bad luck in 18 years

1041
01:14:40,084 --> 01:14:41,999
than anyone should
have in a lifetime.

1042
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,785
Is that supposed to
help me sleep tonight?

1043
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,006
You deserve a break.

1044
01:14:49,963 --> 01:14:53,924
And you can have that if
you can get out of here

1045
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:55,752
and leave this all behind you.

1046
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:01,105
Leaving doesn't
make it go away, Kat.

1047
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,587
It just means I go away
and it all goes with me.

1048
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,893
My memories go with me.

1049
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,941
I'll never be able to forget
my dad getting hauled off

1050
01:15:11,115 --> 01:15:16,294
on my birthday, or my mama
crawling into the bottle,

1051
01:15:16,468 --> 01:15:20,298
or my little brother
drifting away.

1052
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:25,129
Leaving just means
I'll... be leaving behind

1053
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:26,739
all the other people

1054
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,611
that have taken care
of me all these years. And...

1055
01:15:32,005 --> 01:15:33,877
I won't be leaving behind
any of the bad stuff.

1056
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:37,794
I'll just be moving it
with me somewhere else.

1057
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:47,281
It's not that I'm
not ready to go.

1058
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:50,546
I can't.

1059
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,986
My brother needs me.

1060
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,467
My mom needs me.

1061
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:03,515
My dad's about to
get out of prison

1062
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:06,431
and I'm going to hug him
for the first time in ten years.

1063
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:13,003
I'll stay if you want me to.

1064
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:19,879
In Hoxton.

1065
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,491
Look, you--

1066
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:32,326
You've always been like the
glue that holds us all together.

1067
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,548
But you don't always have to
take care of everybody else.

1068
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:44,338
You need to like... go off and
start the rest of your life.

1069
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,605
But I'll stick around
till you're ready.

1070
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:54,131
That's the craziest
thing you've ever said.

1071
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:04,097
I need you to go... you know?

1072
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:09,015
I need you to be my friend
that I can visit on weekends.

1073
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:13,454
I need you to be my friend
that tells all the hot guys

1074
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,545
in college about her cute
friend at home, okay?

1075
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,418
So you gotta go.

1076
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:22,028
All right.

1077
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:26,467
And you can tell them
that gotta know me

1078
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:30,297
because I'm the luckiest
girl in the world...

1079
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,780
because I live in a
safe place with people

1080
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:37,478
watching over me
and taking care of me...

1081
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:41,308
like the Queen of England

1082
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:44,834
in Buckingham Palace
or that castle.

1083
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,230
You know... Windsor.

1084
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,583
Okay.

1085
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:06,029
I love you.

1086
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:08,596
I love you, too.

1087
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:09,179
Hi-de-hi,
and howdy doody

1088
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,485
from your old pal, Uncle Bud.

1089
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:14,140
As all farmers say, when  there's no rain in the forecast

1090
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:17,013
it's going to be another  dadgum beautiful day in Hoxton.

1091
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:18,754
The high, well, it's going to be

1092
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,494
in the 90s, a little
warm for April.

1093
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:22,366
And tonight it'll
dip down in the 60s.

1094
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,542
Now that's all the
details you need, really,

1095
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:26,587
so let's talk about sports.

1096
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,111
The Hoxton Warriors
split a double header

1097
01:19:28,285 --> 01:19:29,286
with Maston yesterday.

1098
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,070
They won the first game

1099
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:32,811
and they ran out of
gas in the second.

1100
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:34,595
And on the national
scene, well, trust me,

1101
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,162
you don't want to
hear about anything

1102
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:38,121
that happened out in Washington.

1103
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:46,129
I could easily
have a bad attitude

1104
01:19:46,303 --> 01:19:48,348
about everything
that's happened.

1105
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:50,698
What with my dad being
in prison and all.

1106
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,788
But I don't.

1107
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:55,355
Because everybody just sort of

1108
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,662
wrapped their arms around
us and took care of us.

1109
01:19:58,184 --> 01:19:59,795
Me and my little brother Buckie

1110
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:03,102
have lived with Kat and
her family for ten years.

1111
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,324
And Harry made me call
him Harry from day one.

1112
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,282
He said he didn't
deserve to be called Dad

1113
01:20:09,456 --> 01:20:13,286
because I already had a
dad and I always would.

1114
01:20:15,071 --> 01:20:17,856
Carolyn, I've always
called "other mother".

1115
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:21,077
Because my mom sort of... um...

1116
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,644
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I'm going on and on.

1117
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,820
I just...

1118
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:29,912
You know, to be honest,
I'm not entirely sure

1119
01:20:30,086 --> 01:20:32,697
why I was elected
class president

1120
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:36,222
or why I got to be head
cheerleader with Kat,

1121
01:20:36,396 --> 01:20:38,137
'cause I'm really
not that flexible.

1122
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:42,402
Um... But, you know, I guess
I get good grades.

1123
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:44,056
But I just do that
to make my dad proud.

1124
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,797
It's nothing crazy.

1125
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:54,240
I guess they voted for me
'cause I'm sort of an underdog.

1126
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:57,809
Maybe I represent
what's happening

1127
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:01,378
to all the little
farmers in this country.

1128
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:06,992
Losing our farm the way we
did, that shouldn't happen.

1129
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:09,560
Not here.

1130
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:11,867
Not in the USA.

1131
01:21:15,566 --> 01:21:17,829
It used to be something
like that wasn't allowed.

1132
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:25,097
So yeah, I guess I
represent the little guys

1133
01:21:25,271 --> 01:21:28,318
and my friends at Hoxton High
wanted everybody to know.

1134
01:21:30,537 --> 01:21:35,716
Anyway... it means to world
to me to be from here.

1135
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:37,588
And it means the world to me

1136
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:40,112
that they voted me
class president.

1137
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:47,728
Because being from Hoxton means
I got two sets of parents,

1138
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:51,819
and a little brother,
and Mr. Denton,

1139
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,169
who's like a granddad to me.

1140
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:57,260
And... Itchy, and Lawton...

1141
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:02,265
Jesse, Clint, and Kat.

1142
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:10,926
That's why I'll always want to
live here, why I always will.

1143
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:17,323
Any plans
for when your daddy gets out.

1144
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:20,370
Well, he gets out April 30th.

1145
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,328
I'm really just hoping everybody

1146
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:24,809
will help me give him
a big welcome home.

1147
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,596
He's had Hoxton in his heart
every day he's been gone.

Mom.

1158
01:23:49,285 --> 01:23:50,373
Mom.

1159
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:12,569
Good morning.

1160
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,745
Now you might think it's  Saturday morning, but it's not.

1161
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:17,226
It's Senior Salute day.

1162
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,445
Be sure you and your
whole family are downtown

1163
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:22,361
on Main Street today when the senior class of Hoxton High

1164
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:26,235
will be saluted on,
yes, a job well done.

1165
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,150
The parade starts at noon.

1166
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:29,847
And if I were you,
I'd be there early

1167
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:31,370
or you might have
to sit in the sun.

1168
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:32,545
What?

1169
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:34,982
Excuse me.

1170
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:36,549
Pardon, excuse me.

1171
01:24:48,518 --> 01:24:50,128
No, they are not there.

1172
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:52,348
The rest of the class is,
but they're-- Hello?

1173
01:24:52,522 --> 01:24:55,699
Hank, did I-- Hank
can you hear me?

1174
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:59,181
Can you hear me now?
Okay, look.

1175
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:03,446
There is no sign, not one,
of my sweet Kat or Maisie.

1176
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,883
Or Lawton, or Itchy,
or Clint, or Jesse.

1177
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:08,320
And we cannot take the
class picture without them.

1178
01:25:08,494 --> 01:25:10,279
And Kat is not
answering her phone.

1179
01:25:10,453 --> 01:25:11,932
Nothing new there.

1180
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,847
But Maisie is not
answering hers either.

1181
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:15,980
Now I am a calm and
reasonable woman.

1182
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:17,068
Are you listening to me, Hank?

1183
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:18,852
Calm and reasonable.

1184
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:22,029
But at some point, when
all sense of order is gone

1185
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:25,032
and the rules of law have
just flown out the window,

1186
01:25:25,207 --> 01:25:27,034
it is not unheard
of for a person

1187
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:29,385
to become just a
little agitated.

1188
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:32,953
Now my babies are graduating
from high school one time.

1189
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,912
One time, Hank.

1190
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:39,351
This is a magical
milestone moment for them.

1191
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:41,440
Are you listening to me?

1192
01:25:41,614 --> 01:25:44,965
Three of our banners,
three of our banners

1193
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,533
have been cut down
and stolen, Hank.

1194
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:51,407
Vandals, vandals, in our town.

1195
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:55,367
Roving gangs of vandals are
desecrating Senior Salute day.

1196
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:56,586
Roving gangs!

1197
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,372
Now I am not going to
lose my self-control.

1198
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:02,374
Nor will I insult
your intelligence

1199
01:26:02,548 --> 01:26:04,550
by lining out for you exactly
where this is all headed.

1200
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:07,292
But you are supposed
to keep us safe, Hank.

1201
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:10,817
Not allow hordes of
devil-worshiping psychopaths

1202
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,863
to kill us in our beds
while we're sleeping,

1203
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:15,474
and this is obviously
where this is all headed.

1204
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:19,696
There is only you
between them and us.

1205
01:26:21,828 --> 01:26:22,786
Thank you.

1206
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:25,571
I know you will.

1207
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:29,880
I'll see you in church, okay.

1208
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:46,505
Paperwork's almost complete.

1209
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,812
You're looking
at about one hour.

1210
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,207
Thank you.

1211
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:40,260
Back then was so different.

1212
01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:41,958
You wouldn't get on an airplane

1213
01:30:42,132 --> 01:30:45,309
without a necktie
and a suit coat.

1214
01:30:46,571 --> 01:30:51,402
No shorts, no flip flops,
no tank tops...

1215
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:56,929
no pajama pants, and no tattoos.

1216
01:30:57,495 --> 01:30:59,802
Well, bikers had tattoos.

1217
01:31:00,411 --> 01:31:02,587
I guess bikers
always had tattoos.

1218
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:06,504
I guess they always will.
I don't know why.

1219
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:10,639
Anyway, people were
better looking then.

1220
01:31:10,813 --> 01:31:13,511
They were just more polite.

1221
01:31:14,207 --> 01:31:16,906
You didn't have to lock
your doors all time.

1222
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:20,823
And if you did lock your doors

1223
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:23,173
they figured something
was going on back there.

1224
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:26,481
You know, a fella
could call a girl

1225
01:31:27,046 --> 01:31:31,181
two, three, four times
and never reach her.

1226
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:36,186
And when you finally did reach her, she'd already agreed

1227
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,971
to be some other fella's
date to the big party.

1228
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:43,236
So... a boy could go from...

1229
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:47,066
being in love
to being broken-hearted

1230
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,634
and never even
talked to the girl.

1231
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,725
The good guys were good guys.

1232
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,902
A lot of cop shows on TV.

1233
01:31:57,381 --> 01:31:59,165
Westerns were big, too.

1234
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:04,170
Movies and TV taught
you good lessons.

1235
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:07,652
People went to
church every Sunday.

1236
01:32:08,871 --> 01:32:12,352
Nobody had a bolt
through the earlobe.

1237
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:16,182
Movie stars didn't run round
without their underwear on.

1238
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:20,491
People took care of each other.
