2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,037
As part of Operation Homecoming
President Nixon has secured the

3
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,037
release of all American prisoners of
war held by the North Vietnamese.

4
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,341
All our boys are back home, no
man was left behind.

5
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:47,771
Washington was rocked this week by
eyewitness reports claiming that 41

6
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:51,938
American POWs are being held in the
jungles of Laos, 20 years after

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,707
the Vietnam War ended.

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,470
None of these reports are verified.
Stop giving these families false hope.

9
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:02,438
Senate hearings today heard evidence
of signals and signs on the ground in

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,971
Southeast Asia that some claim
were made by American POWs

11
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:07,874
held captive since the
Vietnam War.

12
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,937
The government dismissed the
reports amidst growing calls of a

13
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,105
cover-up in Washington.

14
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:18,372
Questions remain of the almost 2,000
American soldiers listed as missing

15
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:24,974
since the Vietnam War.

16
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,806
(guns firing)

17
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:28,138
You know the story. Back in
1889, the French set up a gold

18
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,171
mining operation on this river,
between Vietnam Laos and Cambodia.

19
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:38,271
The French miners, soldiers, and
geologists sent back reports of

20
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:42,738
massive gold discoveries that
made them fabulously rich.

21
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,704
But then, they just disappeared.
55 people vanished into thin air,

22
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:51,438
along with the gold.

23
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,204
But this river is full of gold
and we're going to find it.

24
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:58,270
We've been on the river for
two goddamn days.

25
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,738
When are we going to start
panning for gold?

26
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,137
We passed the old French mining
station a few miles back, we're doing

27
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,270
a short detour first.

28
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,370
- We passed it?
- Yeah.

29
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,838
We didn't agree to no detour.

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,437
We're doing this as a group,
aren't we?

31
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,871
Yes.

32
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:14,371
But as your Geology professor and the
expedition leader, sometimes I'm

33
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,004
going to call the shots.

34
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,371
Says who?

35
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:21,937
Alright, stop messing with the drone.
You're wasting batteries.

36
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,805
Let's get back on the river.

37
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:26,171
Maybe this is what they
mean by fool's gold.

38
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:29,337
Rachel, Anita, shall we head
back?.

39
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,237
I'm going with Steve.

40
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,304
Me too.

41
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:38,137
Jez, are you taking your meds?
You're mom asked me to make sure.

42
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,938
I'm sick of that shit, I don't
need it out here.

43
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,107
Yeah you do.

44
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:08,739
(folk music playing)

45
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,304
It's so peaceful.

46
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:41,737
Yeah, it is now.

47
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:46,770
But only 50 years ago, this was
the epicenter of the Vietnam War.

48
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:50,304
The whole jungle was ravaged in
fighting and bombs.

49
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,371
Even this river was part of the North
Vietnamese army supply route called

50
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:55,136
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

51
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,737
Same as the city.

52
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:02,237
But during the war, before it fell
to the communists, Ho Chi Minh City

53
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,771
was called Saigon.

54
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:09,005
It's where my parents lived
before they escaped to the US.

55
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:12,804
When we left Vietnam, we spent
many years in refugee camps.

56
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:17,237
So, you're one of those ‘Boat
People'?

57
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,103
Yeah.

58
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,237
A lot of shit happened after the
war.

59
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,971
And during it.

60
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:28,303
You know my grandfather was a pilot,
shot down in the Vietnam War?

61
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,204
They never found his body.

62
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,404
Sorry, I didn't know.

63
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:37,203
The war cast a dark shadow
over my family.

64
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,270
I don't give a rat's ass
about the Vietnam War.

65
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,071
We've come for the gold.

66
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,071
Thanks for the sympathy.

67
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,971
Sorry, come on,
you know I didn't mean that.

68
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:50,071
You're like family

69
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:53,905
Steve, you didn't say
there were rapids.

70
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,704
Fuck!

71
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,271
They're not marked on the map.

72
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,170
Better break out the life vests.

73
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:02,904
- Where did you put them?
- Last I saw, they were at camp.

74
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,237
How could you just
leave them behind?

75
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,337
You said the river was flat,
no rapids.

76
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,173
Until your goddamn detour.

77
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,040
Hold on!

78
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,304
Watch Out!

79
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:16,937
Come on guys,
just keep paddling.

80
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,036
We're going to make it.

81
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:18,904
Steve!

82
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,874
Help!

83
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,372
Come on, come on guys.

84
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:10,705
Fuck yeah! That was a blast!

85
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,407
(laughter)

86
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,204
Is everyone ok?

87
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,371
Yeah.

88
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,073
Let's head over there.

89
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:42,438
Is everything there?

90
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,036
Seems to be.
That's pretty damn impressive.

91
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:46,737
That's what happens
when Anita and I pack.

92
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:49,070
You two dummies can't even
pack the life vests.

93
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:51,040
- You all right?
- Yeah

94
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:57,705
Ok, let's make a
fire and dry off.

95
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:01,071
Shit! The map.

96
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,004
So you don't know where we are?

97
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:06,136
Not exactly.
But I know how to get back.

98
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:08,237
The way we came from.

99
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,304
I've got this if it helps.

100
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,340
Yeah, when we get back to
Ho Chi Minh City.

101
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,674
Let's go.

102
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,273
Hey guys.

103
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:55,739
The geology looks great!

104
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,036
I'm gonna check for
gold in the river.

105
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,270
Anyone coming?

106
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,336
We're still drying out after
your last brilliant plan,

107
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:02,470
the detour.

108
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:04,239
Suit yourself.

109
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,236
What the hell do you see
in him Rachel?

110
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:12,237
He's an old fucking man.

111
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,904
He treats me well and
he's not a kid.

112
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,104
I heard him treating you
well last night.

113
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:18,136
Pretty sure it's again the
rules for a professor to

114
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:19,269
be banging one of his students.

115
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:23,203
Grow up Jez. You haven't
changed since high school.

116
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,137
High school probably wasn't even
invented when he was a kid.

117
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,804
Are you taking your meds?

118
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:34,403
Yeah, ask Anita. I took them
before the rapids, right?

119
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:38,674
My watch stopped.

120
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:50,771
I kinda wish I was back home.

121
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,936
Already? We've only
been here for two days.

122
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,771
I usually spend the
summers with my dad.

123
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,404
We'd go fishing and stuff.

124
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,070
I don't get to see him much
since my parents got divorced.

125
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,404
Wait, hang on, you fish?

126
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:04,969
Yeah.
Well, my dad fishes.

127
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:07,770
I work on my tan.

128
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:08,836
Can you hear that?

129
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:11,970
What?

130
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,704
Whispers.

131
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,140
No. What kind of whispers?

132
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,939
I don't know.

133
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,204
This place gives me the creeps.
I think we should get

134
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:30,870
back on the river.

135
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:37,106
So do I. Something's wrong.

136
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:43,438
You still can't hear that?

137
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,173
No.

138
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:56,903
[Whispers]

139
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,736
The jungle can play tricks on your
mind, but I've been on too many

140
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:01,969
camping trips back home to
be scared out here.

141
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:07,273
No, this is different.

142
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:14,707
Not scared? My ass!

143
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,236
Steve, we're gonna split.

144
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,203
Why?

145
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,036
We just don't feel right here.

146
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,870
Are you sure you want to go?

147
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:04,403
Yeah, let's get back up river.

148
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:06,304
Just so you know.

149
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,171
I've found more gold
here in the last two hours,

150
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:12,404
than I've found in Nevada
for the past two years.

151
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:15,103
Bullshit.

152
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,270
No fucking way.

153
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,938
Look for yourself.

154
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:26,305
Look how the plates roll.

155
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,371
- Hey come on.
- What?

156
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:34,337
That's it you got
some too right?

157
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,336
I told you.

158
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,136
Another one.

159
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:42,071
Oh my god!

160
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:46,673
We sure as hell hit the jackpot!

161
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:53,404
We need to go get more firewood.

162
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,071
I'll go with you.

163
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:58,772
Alright.

164
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,404
What are you doing?

165
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:16,003
Hiding the gold.
You can't be too careful,

166
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,170
even out here.

167
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:23,036
Well, Anita and Jez have gone to
get some firewood.

168
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,972
We should take advantage
of this time.

169
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,706
Ok.

170
00:14:56,138 --> 00:15:00,005
[Moaning]

171
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,970
What are you doing?

172
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,904
Sending a message to my hunting
buddies.

173
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:27,104
They'd love it out here.

174
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,803
You won't get any signal.
We're in deep jungle.

175
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,869
Where are we exactly?

176
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,804
Laos.

177
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:36,037
Laos?

178
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,470
Yeah.

179
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:41,104
But we'll be out tomorrow.
Vietnam's just upriver.

180
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,870
But that's why we can't stay any
longer, we don't want to get

181
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:45,736
busted for visas.

182
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,969
Where'd you stash the gold?

183
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:51,104
It's safe.

184
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:56,969
Man, I gotta hand it to you.
That was some haul.

185
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:58,770
To Steve, guys.

186
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:00,203
To Steve.

187
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,672
Steve.

188
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,237
You think we'll get the
same kind of action

189
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,803
at the old French
mining station?

190
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,804
If the historical
accounts are true

191
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,136
and if they found all that gold,

192
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,903
why not?

193
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:18,337
What happened to
the French miners?

194
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,337
Maybe they were killed by gold
robbers, maybe disease.

195
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:28,371
Back in 1889, this place was
wild and dangerous.

196
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,770
There were no clues?

197
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:37,003
None. No bodies were found.

198
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:42,736
But what happened to the gold miners
isn't even the greatest mystery.

199
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:45,037
This jungle is good at
keeping secrets.

200
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,837
What like?

201
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,770
Hundreds of U.S. soldiers and
airmen are still unaccounted for

202
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,970
from the Vietnam War.

203
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:58,270
Just like Anita's grandfather,
maybe thousands

204
00:16:58,272 --> 00:17:01,036
Many were still alive
when the war ended,

205
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,403
left behind
by the U.S. army

206
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:07,337
after they pulled
out of Vietnam.

207
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,136
I wonder what happened
to all of them.

208
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:14,003
They just disappeared.

209
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:17,937
That's bullshit.
The whole POW thing's a myth.

210
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,203
It's stupid shit,

211
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,803
from people who can't let
go of America's glorious past.

212
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:25,303
My grandfather also served.

213
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:28,136
He was drafted as a teenager.
You should be more respectful.

214
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,870
Who cares? The world's moved on.

215
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,170
And the families of the
missing haven't.

216
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,003
Hundreds of thousands of North
Vietnamese soldiers are still

217
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:39,237
unaccounted for.
Nobody's talking about them.

218
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:44,037
They're still here too.

219
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,371
It must have been tough
fighting out here.

220
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,870
Hunting each other like animals,

221
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,773
trying to blow each
other's heads off.

222
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,237
I'd hate to have been caught in one
of the Viet Cong's booby traps.

223
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,937
Those fucking bastards were
dangerous with bamboo.

224
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:04,769
My grandfather was disabled
by a mine. It blew his leg off.

225
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:05,804
Shhhh...

226
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,769
What is it?

227
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,170
Are you ok?

228
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,271
Someone's out there.

229
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:15,173
I didn't hear anything.

230
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,438
Hello?

231
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,340
What the hell?

232
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,969
Travel insurance.

233
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,870
Where did you get that?

234
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:31,236
Ho Chi Minh City.
The guy said it was from

235
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:33,237
the Vietnam War.

236
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,140
[Scraping Sound]

237
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:46,838
Come on out you asshole,
I've got a gun.

238
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,805
I aint askin' again.

239
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:06,137
Steve!

240
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,969
Don't point that gun at me.

241
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,102
Go tie him up.

242
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,837
What are you talking about,
he's not a prisoner.

243
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,736
It's what he deserves, sneaking
around in the middle of the night.

244
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,206
Put the gun down.

245
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,873
Jez

246
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,104
What are you afraid of?

247
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:45,903
Not you that's for sure,
asshole.

248
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:48,936
I'm sorry about him, but
you scared us.

249
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,304
Please sit.

250
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:58,070
What are you doing
out here so late?

251
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you live nearby?

252
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,770
Do you have a name?

253
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,137
I am the guide.

254
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:12,703
The guide? What do you guide?

255
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,369
I guide people out
of the jungle.

256
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,970
We don't need you help man.
We know where we are.

257
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,269
Just leave us alone.

258
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,171
You should not be here.

259
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:24,469
Where, in Laos?

260
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,071
There are many dangers.

261
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,936
Yeah, like tigers, elephants,
snakes, bears.

262
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:31,836
We know the risks out here, man.

263
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,402
Other dangers.

264
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:35,403
Other dangers?

265
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:38,970
You are all in this jungle.

266
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,437
Surrounded by 70 million
years of history.

267
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,973
Where a human life,

268
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:48,936
can pass by in the
blink of an eye.

269
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:52,137
It's pathetic. This
guy's still trying to sell us.

270
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:53,837
We don't scare that easy.

271
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,436
You must go quickly.

272
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:58,104
Why? You got some drug operation
you're protecting?

273
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,071
Some tiger poaching going on?

274
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:02,103
We'll be gone tomorrow. We just
checked the river for gold,

275
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:03,503
we found...

276
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:06,803
He doesn't need to know what we found.
He sticks to his business,

277
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:10,437
we stick to ours.

278
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,137
Hey.

279
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,470
You.

280
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,936
Hey man, back the fuck off.

281
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:23,235
Jez, it's ok.

282
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:24,936
What are you going to do?

283
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:27,903
I'm here to help you.

284
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,836
Fucking leave her alone. Go!

285
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:32,869
I'll go.

286
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,936
But others will come for you.

287
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:40,439
And they'll get some
of this too. Now git!

288
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,970
Hey man, where the fuck
are you going?

289
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:48,170
The gold that you stole from the
river, it must be put back.

290
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:50,770
No fucking way!

291
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:53,736
You cannot steal from it.

292
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:56,236
You cannot hide from it.

293
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,703
It is coming for you.

294
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:58,570
What is?

295
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:01,936
Whatever old man.
Back the fuck off!

296
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:06,172
Jez put the gun down.

297
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:27,437
Jesus! That was an accident.

298
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:34,070
See what happens when you
point guns at people?

299
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:35,836
Are you taking your meds?

300
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:40,071
I didn't think I needed them.

301
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:44,703
Goddamn it!

302
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:46,036
What meds is he on?

303
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:50,003
Bipolar disorder.
You need to take control.

304
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:53,003
Ok, listen up.
It was an accident.

305
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,335
Jez didn't mean to kill him.
We all saw that.

306
00:22:56,337 --> 00:23:00,036
But now we've got to deal
with what's happened.

307
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:03,436
What are we gonna do?

308
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,269
Move the body away
from the camp.

309
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:08,036
Tomorrow we go downriver
to the next town,

310
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,770
take the body with us and

311
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:12,836
report the accident.

312
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:14,370
Wait.

313
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:17,969
Is that a good idea?
We don't know who he is.

314
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:20,703
What if he is with the authorities? I
don't want to spend the rest of my

315
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:23,267
life in a fucking
Laotian prison.

316
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:23,969
So, what do you suggest?

317
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,870
Leave him. He's dead already.

318
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,235
Let's just bury him and be on our way.
Nobody needs to know.

319
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:36,969
No. We've got to do the right
thing, and that's final.

320
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:39,705
Give me a hand.

321
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:14,969
I've never seen a dead
body before.

322
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,239
I've never killed anyone before.

323
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:28,968
We wouldn't be in this mess if
we hadn't taken you detour.

324
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,402
That's right.

325
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:35,837
Blame me for your own stupidity.

326
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,705
Idiot.

327
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:51,302
Fuck!

328
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:54,470
The gold, it's gone!

329
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:57,002
What do you mean?

330
00:25:57,004 --> 00:26:02,169
It's gone. I hid it in the tent.

331
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:05,170
Or was it you.
You said you didn't want

332
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,804
to hand it in.

333
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:13,703
Hey, I'd never steal from my
closest friends.

334
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,335
But I never trusted you.

335
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:17,870
You fuckin' gook.

336
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:18,737
Jez.

337
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:22,935
Guys! Stop!

338
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:23,969
- Steve! Steve!
- Shithead!

339
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:26,236
- Get off him.
- Apologize!

340
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,769
- Ok, I'm sorry.
- Get off him.

341
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,803
Steve, Steve!

342
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,302
But I didn't take the gold
you fucking dick.

343
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,369
Who did it then?

344
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:35,236
Maybe it was the guide, before
he approached us.

345
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:36,968
Why would he risk his life if
he already had it?

346
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,903
It couldn't have
just disappeared.

347
00:26:39,905 --> 00:26:42,868
I guess it's one less thing we
have to worry about, when we go to

348
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,703
the cops tomorrow.

349
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:51,436
We can always come
back and find more

350
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:55,071
Or not.

351
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:46,303
Steve you asshole.

352
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:51,438
What did you say about
wasting batteries?

353
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:15,706
I'm fuckin' losing it.

354
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:25,203
Where've you been with that?

355
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,737
Checking the batteries.

356
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:34,836
Are you ok?

357
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:41,805
Are any of us?

358
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:10,135
What the fuck was that?

359
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:13,003
You all heard it, right?

360
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:15,136
Could be drug gangs fighting.
Lots of heroin gets trafficked

361
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:16,269
through this jungle.

362
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:19,202
They were heavy weapons and they
were landing close by.

363
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,869
Whatever it was, it's over now.

364
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:23,302
And earlier, my drone, it...

365
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,935
What about it?

366
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:28,069
Maybe I'm going crazy.

367
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:31,835
If it was drug gangs and we're in the
middle of some kind of turf war.

368
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:36,769
What if the guide
was one of them?

369
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:39,135
What's gonna happen when they
find out we killed their guy?

370
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:42,871
This is all my fault.

371
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,968
The firefight might actually
help us. Maybe,

372
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,836
they'll think the
other side did it.

373
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:59,439
Will we be safe tonight?

374
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:02,969
It's too dark to leave.

375
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:08,905
Let's try and get some sleep.
We'll start early tomorrow.

376
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:41,438
He's been there all night.

377
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:46,170
OK. Let's get this done.

378
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:48,169
We need to prepare the boat
for the Guide's body.

379
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,169
Then what?

380
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:52,769
Head downstream, find a village,
find the cops.

381
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,202
What happens if they
put me in jail?

382
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,335
They won't.
We're the only witnesses.

383
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,469
We know what happened.

384
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,704
Let's go.

385
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:29,172
Watch your head.

386
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,235
The boats! Where are they?

387
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:41,369
They were here last night.

388
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:44,070
When we got the tarp to
cover the Guide.

389
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:46,938
The Guide!

390
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,936
What the fuck?
Where's the body?!

391
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:55,370
Maybe he was wounded, and he
took the boats to escape?

392
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,203
No way. That dude was dead.

393
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:59,702
We checked, and there was
a ton of blood.

394
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:02,135
But there's none on the ground and
there wasn't any on the trail.

395
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,768
This is a seriously
professional clean-up job.

396
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,802
Maybe he was part
of a drug gang.

397
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:09,836
And it also explains the gun
battle last night.

398
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,736
Whatever. Let's get
out of here while we still

399
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:14,102
- can.
- (whispering) Help, It's coming.

400
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,836
- (whispering) Get out of here.
- Can you hear that?

401
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:21,139
(whispering) You need to leave.

402
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:28,235
Quit it. We're already
freaked out.

403
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,835
They're out there.

404
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:32,968
And they're coming.

405
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,102
Who?

406
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:38,972
I don't know.

407
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,139
Shit!

408
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,135
Oh my God.

409
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,269
Who did this?

410
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,035
Who? Or what!

411
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:07,103
Our drug gang friends
from last night.

412
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:10,038
They also left a calling card.

413
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:19,938
You. Leave. Us.

414
00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:23,302
What do you think it means?

415
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:23,968
I don't know.

416
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,803
Who cares? They want us out!

417
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:36,403
Where are our dry bags?
Our passports, all our money?

418
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:39,803
We're slowly being robbed of
everything.

419
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:44,868
It's like the jungle is
bleeding us dry.

420
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,702
Rachel.

421
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,869
I'm sure it's gonna
to be alright.

422
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:52,272
Jez.

423
00:33:58,004 --> 00:34:00,003
Have you still got your gun?

424
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,468
Fuck.

425
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:08,469
It was in the dry bag.
My meds too.

426
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:11,105
Fuck.

427
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:27,339
“Why did you leave us”?

428
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,803
We'll stay put tonight.
We have a camp.

429
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:39,435
We're near the river and it'll
be dark in a few hours.

430
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:41,202
Will it be safe?

431
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,103
I hope so.

432
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:46,202
You hope so? Is that
the best you got?

433
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:49,836
We'll head out early tomorrow,
moving east towards Vietnam.

434
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,935
How long will it
take to walk out?

435
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:54,802
There's a logging road about
30 miles from here.

436
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,436
But we're almost out of food.

437
00:34:56,438 --> 00:35:00,702
No map and we'll be mostly
traveling through dense jungle.

438
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:01,735
But I have a plan.

439
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:03,902
What? Another detour?

440
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:06,935
We'll take turns as
lookouts on this river.

441
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:09,401
Try to attract passing
boats this afternoon.

442
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:12,336
It'll save us a long
jungle trek tomorrow.

443
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,903
OK.

444
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,302
Any questions?

445
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,404
Good.

446
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,468
What time is it?
I left my watch in the dry bag.

447
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,203
I don't know. It's
still drying out.

448
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,769
How you holding up?

449
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,303
I think I'm going nuts.

450
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,270
Remember last night,

451
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:49,968
my drone started flying
around with no batteries.

452
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,102
That's impossible.

453
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:54,102
I know, right?

454
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:57,370
Nothing seems to make
sense anymore.

455
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,203
Everything changed when I
shot the Guide.

456
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,935
I never should have
never bought that gun.

457
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,768
Listen... Listen.

458
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,803
It was an accident, ok?

459
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:15,338
What's important now is
that we're all safe.

460
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:23,236
Not one boat all afternoon?

461
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:25,071
Nope.

462
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,902
I guess that settles it.

463
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:34,334
Tomorrow we have to trek out.

464
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:36,203
Why can't we go now?

465
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:39,236
It's too dark.

466
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,704
Now is the worst time
to be there.

467
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:51,135
At night this place turns from a
jungle paradise to a primeval hell.

468
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:58,401
Full of fear of the dark,
of the unknown.

469
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:00,935
Of whatever's out
there in the night.

470
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:06,302
Cut it out Anita, you're
freaking me out.

471
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:11,335
Out here, I don't
even have to try.

472
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:14,736
Where you going?

473
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,234
Call of nature.

474
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,768
Alright. Stay close, OK?

475
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,838
OK.

476
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:33,835
Hey.

477
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,202
Do you think Anita's
acting strange?

478
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:38,736
Strange, how?

479
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:43,234
She just seems a bit off.

480
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:46,201
You don't think she
took the gold?

481
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,737
No. No way.

482
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,836
What are you guys talking about?

483
00:37:54,838 --> 00:38:00,270
Nothing.

484
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,201
What are you doing here?

485
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:11,235
Are you CIA?

486
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,736
I'm on holiday.

487
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:14,070
Yeah, holiday my ass.

488
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:16,268
Who holiday's out here in a
fucking war zone?

489
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,736
What war?

490
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:20,835
What the hell is this?

491
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:23,703
It's a cell phone.

492
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:26,202
Turn that fucking thing off.

493
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:28,738
They're gonna see us.

494
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,935
Are you the rescue mission?

495
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,902
No. What rescue mission?

496
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,334
Then who the fuck are you?
And what are you doing out here?

497
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,468
I'm American.
I'm from Wisconsin.

498
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,835
Yeah? And how
about your friends?

499
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,902
And don't give me any of that
bullshit that you guys are on some

500
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:45,301
sort of vacation.

501
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:47,301
We came here on the river
looking for gold.

502
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:51,469
That's it, I swear.

503
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:54,036
I thought you guys
came to get us out.

504
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,769
There's more of you?

505
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,201
We're scattered all
over the jungle.

506
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:00,469
How long have you been here?

507
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,836
A long time

508
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,302
Evading the Viet Cong, the
North Vietnamese Army.

509
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,002
And others.

510
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,902
But we're all trapped here now,
and there's no way out!

511
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,301
Who are you?

512
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:16,435
I'm a pilot.
I managed to escape.

513
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,868
But ever since then I've been
waiting for a rescue mission.

514
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,868
I really need it and you're
obviously not it.

515
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,202
Are you saying that you fought
in the Vietnam War?

516
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:30,201
I'm still fighting in the Vietnam
War and so are all the others.

517
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:33,202
Look, it's not safe for you
and your friends here.

518
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:34,835
You need to leave.
Now.

519
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:38,335
What year is it?

520
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:42,401
It's 1970.

521
00:40:42,403 --> 00:40:44,903
You don't know that?

522
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:46,401
Tell me something

523
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:49,369
who's the president of
the United States?

524
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:52,134
Donald Trump.

525
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:54,368
Who the fuck is he?
It's Richard Nixon!

526
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,002
Kissinger!
The Secretary of State is Henry

527
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:59,334
Kissinger.
Right?

528
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,268
Ok...

529
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,735
I've been here too long. I'm
starting to see shit or you're

530
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:05,302
some sort of a fucking
ghost or something.

531
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:08,703
I am not a ghost.
I'm real, but...

532
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,069
How did you get here?

533
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,201
We were POWs.

534
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,469
We escaped. But that doesn't
matter, because we've

535
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:17,202
been waiting for a rescue
mission every single night, and

536
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:21,169
nothing's showed up.

537
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:24,169
Nobody's coming for you.

538
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:27,135
What the fuck are you talking
about?

539
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:30,134
People back home think that POWs
weren't left behind.

540
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:32,368
They think it's a myth.

541
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,302
Well, let me ask you somethin'g.
Do I look like a goddamn myth?

542
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:41,268
They said that all POWs were sent home
before the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam.

543
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,001
Withdrew? What the fuck
are you talking about?

544
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:51,702
The Vietnam War ended
decades ago.

545
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:55,967
You're full of shit.

546
00:41:55,969 --> 00:42:03,235
Hey! Hey! Hey!

547
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:09,735
Hey! Down here! Down here! Hey!

548
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,968
Fucking assholes!
I see them every night.

549
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,735
It's an SAR flight.

550
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:16,101
What is that?

551
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:19,102
Search and rescue.
They're looking for us, but they

552
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:22,334
never fucking see me.

553
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:26,703
That's because it's a commercial
airliner and they have no idea

554
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,803
that you're here.

555
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:31,401
A commercial airliner?
Are you fucking stupid?

556
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:35,836
The gooks have anti-aircraft
missiles all over this jungle.

557
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,269
It's the 21st century.

558
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:41,101
That would make me a real old
man then wouldn't it honey?

559
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,202
Let me ask you something, do I
look like an old man?

560
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:46,468
No, but you should.

561
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,201
Look, I'm only 22 goddamn it. I
need to get back home to my wife.

562
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:55,102
She's pregnant and I need to
get back to her.

563
00:42:55,104 --> 00:43:02,702
We go married before
I shipped out.

564
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,402
She was my high
school sweetheart.

565
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:07,235
That's your wife?

566
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:10,268
Yeah.

567
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,868
Martha?

568
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,201
How the hell do you
know my wife?

569
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:20,803
She's my grandmother.

570
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:24,835
We have the same photo on
our mantle at home.

571
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:27,169
Oh my god.

572
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,201
You're my grandfather,
Kenneth Bosco?

573
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:39,802
MIA since February 1968? Shot
downover South Vietnam?

574
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:43,302
I was shot down in Laos.
That was supposed to be a

575
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:46,803
top secret mission.

576
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,102
You said you're my...

577
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:53,834
I'm your grand daughter.

578
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:59,002
Anita.

579
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:08,103
Your daughter Caroline, she was
born in 1968. She's my mom.

580
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:13,134
What about Martha?

581
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:17,069
She passed last year.

582
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,772
She never gave up on you.

583
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:42,069
She always would pray that
you'd come back.

584
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:45,202
But you're never going home.

585
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:47,202
Why?

586
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:51,035
Because you're already dead.

587
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:55,002
Your country forgot about you,
but your family never did.

588
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:57,001
Shit.

589
00:44:57,003 --> 00:44:59,101
I don't know how
you know all this.

590
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:02,169
But they wouldn't just leave me
to die all alone in the jungle.

591
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:04,703
They wouldn't leave us.

592
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,034
No man left behind right?

593
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,902
Yes they would.

594
00:45:09,904 --> 00:45:12,902
And they did.

595
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:15,705
I'm sorry.

596
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,269
So they really left us.

597
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:24,934
No one is coming for
us except...

598
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,369
Except what?

599
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,034
I was worried.

600
00:45:28,036 --> 00:45:30,768
I woke and you'd gone.

601
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,035
Did you see him?

602
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:32,669
Who?

603
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:34,301
The guy I was talking to.

604
00:45:34,303 --> 00:45:36,702
Huh? There was no one.

605
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:38,767
Come on, let's go,
let's go back.

606
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,402
But.

607
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,001
He was saying...

608
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:45,234
The jungle can play serious
tricks on your mind.

609
00:45:45,236 --> 00:45:48,438
Come on, let's go.

610
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,004
Anita

611
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,237
Anita.

612
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,237
Follow me.

613
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:27,102
I came to tell you
that I'm going.

614
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:29,934
Where?

615
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:32,902
You made me realize,
nobody's coming for me.

616
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:34,435
For us.

617
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:36,301
It's time I joined Martha.

618
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:38,134
I'm sorry it had to
be like this.

619
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:39,734
Don't be.

620
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:43,401
Because of you, I don't have to spend
the rest of my days being hunted and

621
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:46,135
tracked in the jungle.

622
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,934
Like the rest of ‘em.

623
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,335
How many more are there?

624
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:50,701
Too many.

625
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:52,068
But look, that's not important.

626
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,835
Anita, something really bad is
coming for you and your friends.

627
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:57,369
What?

628
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:59,436
The Greater Evil.
It's too powerful and I

629
00:46:59,438 --> 00:47:01,234
can't protect you.

630
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:05,134
You have to get out of here as
soon as possible.

631
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:09,002
It's time. I gotta go.
Take care.

632
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:12,004
Wait. Wait!

633
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:33,235
OK guys, this is
gonna to be tough.

634
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:36,335
We're traveling through deep jungle.
It's full of unexploded ordnance

635
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:37,835
from the Vietnam War.

636
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:40,103
So we gotta be careful, OK?

637
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:45,670
Let's go.

638
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:37,204
Mind your head guys.

639
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:29,870
Let's take a break.

640
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:45,168
How much further?

641
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,368
Can't be too far.

642
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,170
Just keep moving.

643
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:24,234
Hey.

644
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:26,102
What is it?

645
00:50:26,104 --> 00:50:29,405
On second thought,
don't even tell me.

646
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:54,767
Guys, look. I've found a trail.

647
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:58,970
This'll make our
lives much easier.

648
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:05,971
Hey, look at that.

649
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,168
Seems fresh.

650
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,934
Maybe there are others lost
out here, also looking for help.

651
00:51:15,936 --> 00:51:18,967
We'll follow the trail. It's
heading in the right direction,

652
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:23,370
back to Vietnam.

653
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,135
What's that?

654
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:28,335
You hear it too?

655
00:51:28,337 --> 00:51:30,935
So can I. Sounds like
wind chimes.

656
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:33,269
Just keep moving, they
clearly want us gone.

657
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:34,835
Wait.

658
00:51:34,837 --> 00:51:38,001
Anita!

659
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:41,203
Hey guys! Come here!

660
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:59,801
What are you guys doing?
Don't go in there.

661
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:01,368
You're just gonna
waste more time.

662
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:05,235
Someone might live here,
could help get us out.

663
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:07,135
Let's just keep moving.

664
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:09,102
Are you OK?

665
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:11,169
I'm freaking out
without my meds.

666
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,268
We're gonna make it
OK? Trust me.

667
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,836
Let's just check out
this place first.

668
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,971
What is it?

669
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:26,702
Nothing.

670
00:52:26,704 --> 00:52:29,035
Let's go.

671
00:52:29,037 --> 00:52:31,936
What the fuck?

672
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:42,004
Hello? Is anyone here?

673
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:56,169
Rachel!

674
00:52:56,171 --> 00:52:57,767
Are you OK?

675
00:52:57,769 --> 00:52:58,434
What's wrong?

676
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,201
I think I sprained my ankle.

677
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:02,069
Are you OK?

678
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:06,038
This is beyond scary. Let's go.

679
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,367
Oh my god.

680
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:15,367
Guys.

681
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:17,702
This is my grandfather.

682
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:19,968
He came to me last night and he
showed me this photo.

683
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,102
What are you talking about?
Let's fucking leave.

684
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:24,801
Look, this is my
grandmother Martha.

685
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:26,002
We have the same photo at home.

686
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:29,400
It looks like her, but you said
he visited you last night?

687
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:30,401
Yes he did.

688
00:53:30,403 --> 00:53:32,902
Look.

689
00:53:32,904 --> 00:53:34,935
Dog tags.

690
00:53:34,937 --> 00:53:36,233
What are the odds?

691
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:37,401
We have to bury him.

692
00:53:37,403 --> 00:53:40,038
No way, let's get out of here.

693
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:45,237
What the hell?

694
00:53:56,804 --> 00:54:02,901
It must have been a prison cave,
for American POWs.

695
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:06,101
Poor souls.

696
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:08,201
Now we're in the same situation.

697
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,735
No one knows where we are, no
one's gonna come and find us.

698
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:15,834
And if we die out here no one's
gonna know what happened to us.

699
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:19,268
That ain't happening to me,
I'm leaving.

700
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,001
Jez, please stay.

701
00:54:21,003 --> 00:54:22,401
I gotta get the hell
out of here.

702
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:24,101
I wish you wouldn't.

703
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:28,835
I'll stay on the trail.
I might find help.

704
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:31,267
I've got to bury him.

705
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:35,034
I'll be fine. I,
I just gotta go.

706
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:40,233
OK. Be careful.

707
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,436
We'll be right behind you.

708
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:46,401
Be careful.

709
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:49,302
Watch out for the drug gang.

710
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:16,901
It's hardly Arlington.

711
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:19,835
At least it's a burial.

712
00:55:19,837 --> 00:55:24,334
Most didn't even get that.

713
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:27,802
Any last words?

714
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,167
Can I have a minute?

715
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:32,770
Sure.

716
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,233
I don't want to slow us down.

717
00:56:23,235 --> 00:56:25,901
Don't worry.
I'll carry you the whole

718
00:56:25,903 --> 00:56:28,703
way if I have to.

719
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:38,468
I love you.

720
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,802
That's the first time
you've said it.

721
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:45,169
I love you too. Always have.

722
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:56,867
By the way, when we get back, you
should move more of your stuff

723
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,767
into my apartment.

724
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:01,168
How much?

725
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,237
All of it.

726
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:08,333
You said you're goodbyes?

727
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:10,002
Yeah.

728
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:12,735
OK.

729
00:57:12,737 --> 00:57:17,333
From now on, we stick together,
that way we're stronger.

730
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:20,067
No one's getting left
behind out here.

731
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,201
Jez can't be too far ahead.

732
00:57:22,203 --> 00:57:25,937
. OK, let's get moving.

733
00:57:57,737 --> 00:58:04,737
Jez! Jez!...Jez!

734
00:58:32,202 --> 00:58:35,935
Jez!

735
00:58:38,236 --> 00:58:40,770
Jez!

736
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:11,771
Jez!

737
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,404
Jez!

738
01:00:10,303 --> 01:00:14,368
I have a very bad feeling.

739
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,370
I think he's out there.

740
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:27,467
Oh my God! It's him!

741
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:27,901
Who?

742
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:30,900
Do you see him?

743
01:00:30,902 --> 01:00:32,801
There's no one there.
Cut it out Anita.

744
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,067
He was right there.

745
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:35,233
I think you're hallucinating.

746
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:36,168
I saw him.

747
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,767
Come on.

748
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:40,670
I know what I saw Steve.

749
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:55,401
I don't think I can walk
on it tomorrow.

750
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,966
I'll carry you.

751
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:58,134
I'm serious.

752
01:00:58,136 --> 01:01:00,933
So am I.

753
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:02,966
I don't want to slow us down.

754
01:01:02,968 --> 01:01:06,200
Guys I'm worried about Jez.

755
01:01:06,202 --> 01:01:08,033
He must have gotten out.

756
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:12,234
How long before we hit
the logging road?

757
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:15,267
Maybe tomorrow.

758
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:20,901
Who did you see earlier
today on the trail?

759
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:23,901
You won't believe me.

760
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:26,770
Try us.

761
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,467
When my grandfather visited
me last night...

762
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:39,169
...he warned me of something
called the Greater Evil.

763
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:46,766
I think it's coming for us.

764
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:51,766
So your grandfather's
ghost came and...

765
01:01:51,768 --> 01:01:56,036
Let's turn in.
We've got a long day tomorrow.

766
01:02:24,768 --> 01:02:28,234
Who the fuck are you?

767
01:02:28,236 --> 01:02:29,367
Are you the rescue team?

768
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:30,400
No... No.

769
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:31,233
Are you tracking me?

770
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:31,866
No.

771
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:33,068
Are you trying to kill me?

772
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,401
No.

773
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:37,301
Please.

774
01:02:37,303 --> 01:02:40,168
Speak!

775
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,300
Are you him?

776
01:02:42,302 --> 01:02:43,101
Who?

777
01:02:43,103 --> 01:02:44,303
The Greater Evil.

778
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:57,767
I can help you.

779
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:00,900
What's your name?

780
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,168
Brandon.

781
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,703
Special Ops.

782
01:03:08,437 --> 01:03:10,734
How did you get here?

783
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:16,866
I was captured. Held in the
jungle as a POW for years.

784
01:03:16,868 --> 01:03:21,333
Then one day, the Vietnamese
were gone, and we escaped.

785
01:03:21,335 --> 01:03:25,300
I've been here ever
since, waiting.

786
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,935
To be rescued?

787
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:32,434
When was this?

788
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:35,867
April 1970.

789
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:38,367
We were on a secret mission.

790
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:40,800
Into Laos?

791
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:43,734
How do you know that?
That's classified.

792
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,167
Not anymore.

793
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:48,934
You were never rescued because
the US government didn't want

794
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,966
the world to know where you
had been captured.

795
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:53,033
It was the CIA's ‘Secret War'.

796
01:03:53,035 --> 01:03:54,133
How do you know all this?

797
01:03:54,135 --> 01:03:56,933
My grandfather died out here.

798
01:03:56,935 --> 01:03:59,101
Grandfather?

799
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:00,934
What are you from
the fuckin' future?

800
01:04:00,936 --> 01:04:04,669
You expect me to believe that?

801
01:04:08,702 --> 01:04:11,867
Look, you gotta help me.

802
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:14,933
Something ain't right.

803
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:19,367
I've tried to leave, I keep
ending up back in the same place.

804
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:23,101
I think I'm losing my mind.

805
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:25,801
Shhh... He's close.

806
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:28,201
Who?

807
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:31,435
The Greater Evil.

808
01:04:31,437 --> 01:04:34,267
You're really not him?

809
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:36,967
Shit kid.

810
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:42,301
If he comes for you,
you'll know it.

811
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:46,003
You said you could help me?

812
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,801
Please.

813
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:54,037
What I'm gonna tell you sounds
crazy, and it's bad news.

814
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,101
OK.

815
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:03,003
- Give it to me straight.
- Ok.

816
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:10,168
You're dead. You died
a long time ago.

817
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,867
Is that supposed to be
some kind of joke?

818
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:13,435
Because it ain't funny.

819
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:15,700
- It's not meant to be.
- Then it's some stupid fucking

820
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:16,468
bullshit!

821
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,001
Let me prove it.
I can prove it.

822
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:22,103
Please...

823
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:38,000
You know this city
as Saigon, right?

824
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:40,800
Ho Chi Minh city.

825
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:45,367
What the fuck is this?

826
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:52,200
Saigon fell in 1975 and
changed its name.

827
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:56,869
The world has moved on and
you've been lost to history.

828
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:01,401
You mean to tell me.

829
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:05,133
I've been out in this jungle.

830
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:09,033
For 50 fuckin' years

831
01:06:09,035 --> 01:06:15,168
Fighting a war that ended
decades ago?

832
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:19,168
I'm so sorry.

833
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,902
It's not your fault kid.

834
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:28,835
You've done me a real solid.

835
01:06:32,703 --> 01:06:36,370
I just gotta get to
where I need to be.

836
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,969
Take care.

837
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:31,134
Great.

838
01:07:31,136 --> 01:07:33,399
What do we do now?

839
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:35,901
How can a trail come
to a dead end?

840
01:07:35,903 --> 01:07:38,434
It can't just stop here.

841
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:40,834
I'll look around.

842
01:07:40,836 --> 01:07:41,766
I'll come with you.

843
01:07:41,768 --> 01:07:44,300
No, stay with Rachel.

844
01:07:44,302 --> 01:07:46,734
I won't go far.

845
01:07:46,736 --> 01:07:49,736
Be careful.

846
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:20,101
Steve, do you think
we'll ever get out?

847
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:24,901
I have to.
Now's not the time to lose hope.

848
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:28,901
But if this is the
end of the trail.

849
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:31,834
What happened to Jez?

850
01:08:31,836 --> 01:08:33,366
He may have got lucky.

851
01:08:33,368 --> 01:08:36,869
Found another way.

852
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:44,766
Hey! I found a viewpoint.

853
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:45,466
Really?

854
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:48,200
Yeah.

855
01:08:48,202 --> 01:08:51,170
We can get our bearings.
Maybe even see a village.

856
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:56,200
What are you doing?

857
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:57,833
I'm not leaving you.

858
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:00,967
You can't get me through that.
Leave me, I'll be fine.

859
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,233
She's right.
It's not far.

860
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:05,833
We'll be quick.

861
01:09:05,835 --> 01:09:08,167
Don't go anywhere.

862
01:09:08,169 --> 01:09:09,299
I love you.

863
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:12,001
I love you too.

864
01:09:12,003 --> 01:09:14,237
Be right back.

865
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:34,436
Hello?

866
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:37,766
Who's there?

867
01:09:37,768 --> 01:09:41,402
Jez, Jez is that you?

868
01:10:23,703 --> 01:10:28,068
Guys! Hey guys!

869
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:32,936
Guys I think I've found Jez.

870
01:10:42,102 --> 01:10:45,102
Wow. It's beautiful.

871
01:10:47,803 --> 01:10:51,767
But there's no roads,
there's no villages.

872
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:54,068
This isn't right.

873
01:10:54,070 --> 01:11:00,267
We're heading west, but we should
be moving east, towards Vietnam.

874
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:03,200
You mean we're lost?

875
01:11:03,202 --> 01:11:05,801
I don't understand it.

876
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,167
I t doesn't make sense.

877
01:11:08,169 --> 01:11:13,000
So where's the logging road?

878
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,433
I have no idea.

879
01:11:14,435 --> 01:11:17,134
Steve.

880
01:11:17,136 --> 01:11:19,300
Don't say that. You're the one
who's supposed to be

881
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:23,902
getting us out of here.

882
01:11:34,235 --> 01:11:39,966
Jez! Jez!

883
01:11:39,968 --> 01:11:43,735
Jez, is that you?

884
01:12:14,201 --> 01:12:17,736
Steve, Steve.

885
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:26,467
Steve.

886
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:28,267
Steve!

887
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:29,767
Anita!!

888
01:12:29,769 --> 01:12:32,966
Help me, help! Help! Help!

889
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:35,000
Help!

890
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:38,769
STEVE!

891
01:12:43,102 --> 01:12:44,069
Rachel!

892
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:48,132
Shit!

893
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:49,934
Rachel!

894
01:12:49,936 --> 01:12:51,967
Where is she?

895
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:53,132
She must be here somewhere.

896
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:55,133
Rachel!

897
01:12:55,135 --> 01:12:58,434
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

898
01:12:58,436 --> 01:13:01,000
Rachel!

899
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,733
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

900
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:06,766
Rachel!

901
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:09,232
Rachel!

902
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:12,733
I left her right there on the
path! Right there! Rachel!

903
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:15,801
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

904
01:13:15,803 --> 01:13:17,067
What was that explosion?

905
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:18,800
Shit!

906
01:13:18,802 --> 01:13:21,067
Maybe the drug gang took her?

907
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:24,967
Oh God. Oh God!

908
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:29,202
Rachel!...

909
01:13:37,803 --> 01:13:40,001
It's been hours.

910
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:43,300
She's not here.
Let's get back on the trail.

911
01:13:43,302 --> 01:13:46,299
I promised I wouldn't
leave her out here.

912
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,869
We have to face
reality she's...

913
01:13:51,102 --> 01:13:53,701
Let's find some more help
and come back for her.

914
01:13:53,703 --> 01:13:55,400
It's the only way.

915
01:13:55,402 --> 01:14:00,033
I can't leave her, I won't!

916
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:05,169
I care about her too, but we're
no use to her dead.

917
01:14:06,168 --> 01:14:09,168
We have to keep moving, come on.

918
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:30,435
Come on Steve.
Let's keep moving.

919
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:54,969
I couldn't even protect her.

920
01:14:56,135 --> 01:14:58,769
Don't say that, you did
what you could.

921
01:15:02,736 --> 01:15:05,202
It's all my fault.

922
01:15:09,903 --> 01:15:12,766
If we hadn't taken the detour...

923
01:15:12,768 --> 01:15:17,032
...the rapids

924
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:24,735
...the Guide, Jez, Rachel.

925
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:38,236
It's hopeless.

926
01:15:41,469 --> 01:15:43,369
It's hopeless.

927
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:55,870
Hey, we have to keep moving
for Rachel, and Jez.

928
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:08,301
Let's get some rest.

929
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:34,969
Hello?

930
01:16:37,436 --> 01:16:40,033
Rachel?

931
01:16:40,035 --> 01:16:42,701
Hello?

932
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:44,803
Rachel!

933
01:16:55,802 --> 01:16:57,235
Jez!

934
01:17:10,469 --> 01:17:14,036
It's impossible!

935
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:32,101
Steve?

936
01:17:36,301 --> 01:17:39,035
Steve!

937
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:01,736
Shit!

938
01:18:05,169 --> 01:18:06,268
Help!

939
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:12,069
Help!

940
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:24,869
Stay back!

941
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,366
Stay back!

942
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:30,299
Hello Anita.

943
01:18:30,301 --> 01:18:33,368
You don't have to fear me.

944
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:37,434
Are you going to kill me?

945
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,467
Did you kill my friends?

946
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:41,832
I don't need to kill you...

947
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:45,999
...because you're already dead.

948
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,399
But don't worry.

949
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:50,800
What the fuck is going on?

950
01:18:50,802 --> 01:18:53,032
What do you mean
‘we're all dead'?

951
01:18:53,034 --> 01:18:58,670
You drowned at precisely
12:01 p.m. on the river.

952
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:05,233
But you're dead too.
I saw you get shot.

953
01:19:05,235 --> 01:19:12,467
That had to happen, so you'd
believe in me now.

954
01:19:12,469 --> 01:19:16,066
What about my friends?

955
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:18,000
They didn't know they'd died.

956
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:20,800
So I helped then move on.

957
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:23,436
How do you help them exactly?

958
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:29,833
I roam the jungle...

959
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:32,300
...tracking the already dead...

960
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:37,900
...and those that have not come
to terms with the situation.

961
01:19:37,902 --> 01:19:42,999
I hunt them and kill them, using
their worst fears.

962
01:19:43,001 --> 01:19:46,833
It must have been tough fighting
out here, trying to blow each

963
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:50,299
other's heads off.

964
01:19:50,301 --> 01:19:54,833
I'd hate to have been caught in one
of the Viet Cong's booby traps.

965
01:19:54,835 --> 01:19:58,067
Those fucking bastards were
dangerous with bamboo.

966
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:03,367
My grandfather was disabled
by a mine. It blew his leg off.

967
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:08,000
Leaving them with in doubt that
this time, they're dead.

968
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:12,766
Sounds like a sadistic way to
deliver bad news.

969
01:20:12,768 --> 01:20:19,100
It has its drawbacks, but
it's effective.

970
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:21,000
How long have you
been doing this?

971
01:20:21,002 --> 01:20:23,733
Lifetimes.

972
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:26,200
But now you are here.

973
01:20:26,202 --> 01:20:27,865
You're different.

974
01:20:27,867 --> 01:20:30,200
You have a gift.

975
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:32,100
What gift?

976
01:20:32,102 --> 01:20:34,965
The gift of compassion.

977
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:39,766
Soul seek you out, they come to you
for help, and you can give it.

978
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:44,467
So let me get this straight.

979
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:45,668
I'm dead.

980
01:20:46,235 --> 01:20:50,100
And you want me to stay out
here, herding souls like you do?

981
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:52,933
Think about it Anita.

982
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:59,132
It is no coincidence that you died in
the same jungle your grandfather did.

983
01:20:59,134 --> 01:21:04,367
I always believed my grandfather
was betrayed by his country.

984
01:21:04,369 --> 01:21:06,999
My whole family did.
We never gave up on him.

985
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:13,033
It's that empathy, that
connection which is so powerful.

986
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:18,199
You can lead them to their
final resting place.

987
01:21:18,201 --> 01:21:20,200
Who's out here?

988
01:21:20,202 --> 01:21:25,966
Soldiers from all sides of the
wars that ravaged this jungle.

989
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:28,900
Why are there so many Americans?

990
01:21:28,902 --> 01:21:32,466
POWs from the Vietnam War.

991
01:21:32,468 --> 01:21:39,699
Ignored, forgotten, left to die and
rot out here by their own country.

992
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:41,233
They deserve better.

993
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:45,100
And with you they'll get it.

994
01:21:45,102 --> 01:21:48,966
You can finally free them
from the despair...

995
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:53,167
...the betrayal, and this
never-ending jungle.

996
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:55,332
Anita.

997
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:57,901
Do you accept?

998
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,900
Because of you, I don't have to spend
the rest of my days being hunted and

999
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:08,766
tracked through the jungle.

1000
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,434
You made me realize, no
one's coming for me,

1001
01:22:11,436 --> 01:22:13,133
For us.

1002
01:22:13,135 --> 01:22:16,136
It's time I joined Martha.

1003
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:25,002
I accept.

1004
01:22:28,134 --> 01:22:31,036
Then my time is at an end.

1005
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:37,865
And when you guide the last
one out, you too will go.

1006
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:41,167
But what about the Greater Evil.

1007
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:45,267
The thing that's coming for us?

1008
01:22:45,269 --> 01:22:48,700
There is no Greater Evil.

1009
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:52,899
It's just a fear of death of
those caught in limbo.

1010
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:56,899
They thought I was the Greater
Evil because I hunted, tracked

1011
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:59,932
and killed them.

1012
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:05,033
But I was their greatest relief
too, if only they knew it.

1013
01:23:05,035 --> 01:23:07,400
And the drug gang?

1014
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:13,201
A figment of your imagination.

1015
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:24,035
It is time.

1016
01:23:31,369 --> 01:23:33,902
Goodbye my child.

1017
01:23:36,001 --> 01:23:38,136
Be strong.

1018
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:44,802
(whispering) Help me.

1019
01:24:57,268 --> 01:24:58,969
Are you the rescue mission?

1020
01:25:01,834 --> 01:25:04,169
Yes. Yes, I am.

1021
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,168
Please help me.
I want to go home.

1022
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:48,410
