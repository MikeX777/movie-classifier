1
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,230
THE TOBACCONIST

2
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,230
So, what's the boy been up to?

3
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,549
Well

4
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,949
nothing.

5
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,912
I'm thinking of raising
the monthly sum a bit.

6
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,833
He could work on one of my ferry boats.

7
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,236
I'm gonna take a quick dip in the lake.

8
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,154
What happened?

9
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,795
Pardon me.

10
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Preininger Lois was a good man.

11
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,235
He did a lot for his community.

12
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,399
Even as a small boy...

13
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,995
Even as a small boy
he loved to jump into the lake.

14
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,919
But last Sunday

15
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,111
for the very last time.

16
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,590
In the name of the Father,

17
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,514
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

18
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,114
Amen.

19
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,119
Franzl.

20
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,553
Franz, please.

21
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,312
Show me your hands.

22
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,351
You can't work in the woods.

23
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,195
Preininger's gone.

24
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,711
All I have is my maid's salary
at the Goldener Leopold.

25
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,832
I've given it some thought.

26
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,397
There's this man,
he has a tobacco shop in Vienna.

27
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,279
I sent him a telegraph.
His name's Otto Trsnyek.

28
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,358
How do you know him?

29
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,271
He splashed around here one summer.

30
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,274
It was hot that year, and we were

31
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,670
very young and foolish.

32
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,114
It was long before you fell into my lap.

33
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,918
What does that mean now?

34
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,999
It means you're off to Vienna tomorrow.

35
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,596
Vienna? Tomorrow?

36
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,594
Certainly not.

37
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
Franz?

38
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,114
Franz!

39
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,155
The train leaves in an hour!

40
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,959
Come on.

41
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,595
Hurry.

42
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,678
Write me a postcard every week.

43
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,751
Oh, he's so good-looking.

44
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,835
Vienna has lost its Rotunda.

45
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,355
Huge fire catastrophe.

46
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,156
Huge fire catastrophe.
Vienna no longer has a Rotunda.

47
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,354
<i>Draw your lucky card</i>

48
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,836
Are you feeling unwell, young man?

49
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,919
It's just so noisy. And it stinks...
From the canal, maybe.

50
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,077
It's not the canal.

51
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,719
It's the times.

52
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,153
These are rotten times.

53
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,910
Have you come from far away?

54
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,634
From home.

55
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,357
Best thing you can do
is go straight back there.

56
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,278
One can get used to anything.

57
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,110
Ladies and gents, got work for me?

58
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,715
Good day.

59
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,793
Hello there, Franzl.

60
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,195
You know who I am?

61
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,112
Who else would you be?

62
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,874
You're late.

63
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,277
It's almost noon.

64
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,518
And you're Otto Trsnyek.

65
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,390
Who else would you be.

66
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,039
Right.

67
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,994
So,

68
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,799
these are my acquaintances.

69
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,839
My friends.

70
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,995
I'd love to keep them all.
But I give them away.

71
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,479
Every day. And you know why?

72
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,031
Because I'm a tobacconist.

73
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,190
And will always be a tobacconist.

74
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,398
Until the good Lord pulls down my shades.

75
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,949
A good day to you, Frau Dr.
- A pack of <i>Gloriettes.</i>

76
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,077
Yes, right away.

77
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,194
And this is my new employee,
his name's Franz.

78
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,915
Franz?

79
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,675
How sweet!

80
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,157
Give my regards to your husband, Frau Dr.

81
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,954
Cigarettes,

82
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,112
are all well and good.

83
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,554
But true culture,
and I'm talking about smoking culture,

84
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,234
lies elsewhere.

85
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,958
Look at this.

86
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,035
These

87
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,516
are real Havanas.

88
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,318
So, yes.

89
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,318
I have acquired them

90
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,837
for special customers.

91
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,992
Who want to treat themselves
to something exquisite,

92
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,594
or can afford it.

93
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,554
That expensive?
- The finest imported goods.

94
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,155
Need to be turned often, so

95
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,269
they don't dry out.
That's one of your tasks.

96
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,276
It's the sale of

97
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,757
these cigars,

98
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,032
that turns a plain old stinky tobacconist's
into a temple,

99
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,395
of pleasure and spirit.

100
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,759
Does this make sense so far?

101
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,036
Good, then take your rucksack

102
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,400
and follow me!

103
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,596
A bad cigar,

104
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,911
tastes like horse shit,

105
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,960
a good cigar tastes like tobacco,

106
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,311
but a very good cigar,

107
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,676
tastes like the world.

108
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,957
So, you can wash here

109
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,198
and sleep there.

110
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,355
The toilet?
- There's one outside the pub across the street.

111
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,915
The key's on a hook by the front door.

112
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,794
And what's in there?

113
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,520
That's none of your business. None at all.

114
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,754
We have customers.
Hurry and put on something decent

115
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,189
then you can

116
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,398
start working for me,

117
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,598
as a tobacconist.

118
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,155
Delighted to see you madam.
- Good day.

119
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,151
What'll it be?
- The Egyptian ones?

120
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,158
The Egyptian ones, of course.

121
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,034
Here you are.

122
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,029
So, one New <i>Free Press</i>
for our schoolmaster.

123
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,472
I can't tempt you to smoke? No?

124
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,633
Anything else?
- No, thanks.

125
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,873
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, sir.

126
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,760
Study the customers, Franzl.

127
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,913
Pick up on their habits, their preferences.

128
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,553
A tobacconist's capital is his memory.

129
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,309
And read the newspapers, every day.

130
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,679
It's our main business!

131
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,719
And not one paper or two, but all of them.

132
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,038
You don't need to read them cover to cover.
Just the leading articles and columns.

133
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,999
Hello ladies. what can I do for you?
- Good day.

134
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,276
Don't you want to assist the young ladies?

135
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,472
Notebooks and pens are over there!

136
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,271
<i>One Nationalzeitung</i> !

137
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,359
We don't have it.

138
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,834
What does that mean?

139
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,550
National Socialist papers
are allowed in Austria again!

140
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,710
Yes?

141
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,953
But not in my shop.

142
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,032
We'll get you off that high horse!
You can bet on it!

143
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,436
A nice day to you too.

144
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,072
I live a few houses down,
on the ground floor.

145
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,192
But I don't like to cook.
Let's go to the Wild Man!

146
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,478
You can check out the outside toilet...

147
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,392
Look who's here, Red Egon!

148
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,110
Exactly 10 seconds after I lock up,
as always.

149
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,396
A packet of <i>Sport</i> and the Red <i>Flag</i> !

150
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,473
Sure, Why would you care about
my lunch break!

151
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,830
That stuff in there about world peace
andjusfice!

152
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,394
All just illusions...

153
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,277
Keep talking, Trsnyek,
the revolution is coming!

154
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,760
And soon!

155
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,520
Yes, yes.

156
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,515
I'll give you your change tomorrow.

157
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,433
I'm not opening it up again just for you.
Have a nice lunch.

158
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,872
There you go.
Two specials, goulash Szegedin style.

159
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,189
Enjoy your meal!
- Thanks.

160
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,113
So, how's your mother?

161
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,440
The same as always.

162
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,312
As always, aha.

163
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,551
A very detailed account.

164
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,078
She hasn't had it easy.

165
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,953
Does she have someone?

166
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,074
Have someone?

167
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,957
Someone to protect her,

168
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,359
in times like these.

169
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,197
I don't think so. Preininger drowned.

170
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,993
Another beer, please.

171
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,199
<i>Dear Mama, the work is interesting.</i>

172
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,789
<i>Otto Trsnyek sends his regards.</i>

173
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,271
<i>How are you?
I'm fine. Yours, Franz.</i>

174
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,716
<i>Who else would you be?</i>

175
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,110
Dr. Schuschnigg in Innsbruck.

176
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,709
Federal Chancellor holds big speech.

177
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,076
Dr. Schuschnigg in Innsbruck.

178
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,719
Good-morning, Professor.
- Good-morning.

179
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,117
Trabuccos, as usual?
- Two boxes please

180
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,517
<i>and a New Free Press.</i>

181
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,757
This, by the way, is Franz.

182
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,351
Comes from the Salzkammergut
and still has a lot to learn.

183
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,031
The Salzkammergut. Very nice.

184
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,914
Thank you.

185
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,111
Good bye.

186
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,197
Have a nice day, Professor.

187
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,473
By the way,
that was Professor Sigmund Freud.

188
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,910
I'm sure you've heard of him.

189
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,476
Professor Freud?
- Yes.

190
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,472
He treats nut cases.

191
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,559
And is world famous.

192
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,193
He sets their heads straight.

193
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,394
Inside.

194
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,274
At least,
the ones of those who can afford him.

195
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,750
An hour with him costs as much as

196
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,919
half a garden plot.

197
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,674
His cigars.

198
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,114
Professor,

199
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
your cigars!

200
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,438
My sincere thanks.

201
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,397
Please, it goes without saying!

202
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,275
Nothing goes without saying these days.

203
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,558
But, thank you.

204
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,552
May I accompany you?

205
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,034
That one's mine.
It's the tenth one I found today.

206
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,834
There, take it. You take it.

207
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,836
May I ask you something, Professor?

208
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,639
It depends.

209
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,871
Is it true that you straighten out
people's heads?

210
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,995
Who told you that?

211
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,034
Otto Trsnyek. Inside, he said.

212
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,873
A charming way of putting it.

213
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,159
Yes, sometimes.
If we're lucky, my patient and I.

214
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,600
How do you do it?

215
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,549
People lie down on my
couch and begin to talk.

216
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,915
On a couch?

217
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,750
They could stand.
But it's more comfortable lying down.

218
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,519
It sounds comfortable.

219
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,911
Truth is seldom comfortable.
So, this is where I live.

220
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,276
May I have my cigars, please?

221
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,313
Thank you very much.

222
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,239
I'm gonna buy all your
books and study them.

223
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,998
For heaven's sake!

224
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,796
Don't you have better things to do?

225
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,099
You're young! Get some fresh air.
Enjoy yourself!

226
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,794
Find yourself a girl!
- A girl?

227
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,994
If only it were that easy!

228
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,312
Most people have managed, up to now.

229
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,711
It doesn't mean that I'll succeed.

230
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,952
Why wouldn't you, of all people?

231
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,515
Back home people know all about timber.

232
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,999
But love. ..
- That's not unusual.

233
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,232
No one knows anything about love.

234
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,158
Not even you?
- No.

235
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,391
Especially not me.

236
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,273
But people are always falling in love!

237
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,115
You don't need to understand water
to jump in it.

238
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,313
I wish you a pleasant day.

239
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,958
Good-bye.

240
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,159
Take your time! A few of them are new!

241
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,476
Wrap it in neutral paper, please.
- Of course.

242
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,278
That's fine.
- I sincerely thank you. Herr Engineer.

243
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,229
Good-bye.

244
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,996
Get this into your head:

245
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,599
Discretion is the key in a case like this!

246
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,393
In a case like what?

247
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,196
In the case of the sensitive magazine,
for God's sake!

248
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,238
A tobacconist

249
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,359
sells

250
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,399
pleasure

251
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,079
and desire.

252
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,637
And sometimes also

253
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,760
vice.

254
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,154
Faster!

255
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,913
Higher, come on!

256
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,469
Good day.

257
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,917
I'm Franz Huchel from Attersee
and I'd like to invite you to a carousel ride.

258
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,391
Carousel no, but I like shoot, thank you.

259
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,514
Dead! Again!

260
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,469
Now you!

261
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,115
No can shoot. but you have a cute tushy.
Come on!

262
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,519
Full now.

263
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,031
Want share one more beer?

264
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,356
He from Bohemia. Like me.

265
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,558
What age you have?

266
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
Seventeen.

267
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,231
Not matter. Now dance!
- No.

268
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,039
Come.
- I can't...

269
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,513
Feel I you down there?
- Sorry.

270
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,315
Why sorry? Nice compliment.

271
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,074
So!

272
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
Have danced, have drunk -

273
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,792
what we do now?

274
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,276
Sonny, you alright?

275
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,189
I still have two and a half schillings.

276
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,433
So, it's 4 beers or two carousel rides.

277
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,911
Back soon, sonny.

278
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,231
One more drink?
- No.

279
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,118
Nothing else? Thanks.

280
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,596
I'm Franz Huchel from Attersee...

281
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,669
Stop!

282
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,718
<i>Now that the last guests have left,
the lake is especially beautiful.</i>

283
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,873
<i>It's not the lake's fault if someone
jumps in it during a thunderstorm.</i>

284
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,394
<i>How do you come up with such strange ideas?</i>

285
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,474
<i>That truth is seldom comfortable,</i>

286
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,515
<i>and that you don't need to understand water to jump in it</i>

287
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,434
<i>You haven't fallen in love, have you?</i>

288
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,994
Franz!

289
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,830
Who was it?

290
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,395
Who smeared my facade?

291
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,229
I can guess. Rosshuber!

292
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,797
Rosshuber come out,

293
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,799
you cripple.

294
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,438
The young man
comes crawling out of his hole as well.

295
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,837
What's wrong?
- Open your eyes! Blood!

296
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,473
Pig's blood!

297
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,315
Personally smeared here
by our friendly neighbor Rosshuber!

298
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,278
Which remains to be proven!

299
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,717
Also, that's not the blood of a sow,
but a chicken.

300
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,799
Anyone can see that.
- Then it comes from a chicken, so what!

301
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,431
Who's brainless enough
to defile other people's facades?

302
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,759
Who has a swastika
on the back of his lapel

303
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,633
just waiting to turn it around?

304
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,634
What I have under my collar
is none of your damn business!

305
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,113
This person, this so-called butcher,

306
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,635
has blood on his hands

307
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,031
and black malice in his heart!

308
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,709
And now

309
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,236
let me tell you something, Rosshuber!

310
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,510
Served this country

311
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,513
in 1917, by leaving my foot in a

312
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,112
muddy stinkhole.

313
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,232
One's still left.

314
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,756
It's a little stiff at the hip.

315
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,271
But it's good enough to kick your ass.

316
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,551
Leave the Jew-lover alone!

317
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,196
He's a coward too.

318
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,954
What are you looking at?

319
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,909
Don't you have some place to go?

320
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,835
And you, get a bucket and wash this off!
As fast as you can.

321
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,113
Why did the butcher's wife
call you a Jew-lover?

322
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,271
'Cause she has shit for brains.

323
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,960
They both do.

324
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,991
They're jealous 'cause I have more clients.

325
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,274
I also serve Socialists like that one

326
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,113
and Jews. Why shouldn't I?

327
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,669
Speaking of Jews, here comes Freud.

328
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,835
Hello there, Professor.
- Good day.

329
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,233
Same as always, Professor?
- As always, yes.

330
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,995
And?

331
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,392
Any luck with the ladies?

332
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,880
So-so.

333
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,199
What do you mean?

334
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,953
I found one.

335
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,912
Congratulations.

336
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,276
You don't like to waste time, do you?

337
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,431
But she got away.

338
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,713
It happens.
Then the next one comes along.

339
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,156
There will never be one like this.

340
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,036
She has the world's nicest tooth gap.

341
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,313
I understand.

342
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,717
You're suffering. I can assure you:

343
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,316
This pain is treatable.
- I don't think so.

344
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,599
What should I do?

345
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,109
The professor doesn't have time
to give advice to snotty-nosed brats!

346
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,797
Perhaps a young man like this
needs advice the most.

347
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,235
I'm giving you three prescriptions.
Oral ones.

348
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,038
The first is for your headache:
Stop thinking about love.

349
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,149
The second is for your stomach ache
and disturbing dreams:

350
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,631
Put pen and paper by our bed and jot down
all your dreams as soon as you wake up.

351
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,789
The third prescription is for heartaches:

352
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,992
Get the girl back -

353
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,994
or forget her.

354
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,994
Can't do either.

355
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,115
Why?

356
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,030
Can I go on your couch sometime, Professor?

357
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,073
What do you want to go on my couch for?

358
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,998
I don't know.

359
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,760
But I'll find out when I lie down on it.

360
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,115
You think so?

361
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,714
Thank you.

362
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
I wish you a lovely day.

363
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,397
Good bye, Professor.

364
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,351
<i>Ho yo de Monterrey.</i>

365
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,590
Harvested by brave men

366
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,795
and hand-rolled tenderly
by beautiful women on their thighs.

367
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,915
Mama?

368
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,955
Yes, come here, you lovely girl!

369
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,630
Feel I you down there?

370
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,679
It a nice compliment.

371
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,392
In the window

372
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,712
of our home

373
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,830
...a puppet theater.

374
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,393
He's been sitting there for half an hour.

375
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,440
At least he has a scarf.

376
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,799
Who's sitting out there?

377
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,869
You shouldn't smoke so much!

378
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,233
Who's coughing, you or me?

379
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,838
Don't you get it? The smoke bothers Mama.

380
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,798
The dentures.

381
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,189
Thanks.

382
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,037
I should've had them made by a carpenter
instead of a doctor.

383
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,840
Or gone straight to a headstone carver.

384
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,231
Another patient just cancelled.

385
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,833
At least the ones from abroad
are still coming.

386
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,514
That leaves me more time to write.

387
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,878
If only I could concentrate better.

388
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,273
You need to move more.
That'll get your spirit moving as well.

389
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,629
Then, I'll smoke outside today.

390
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,279
Good evening.

391
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,953
Professor.

392
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,794
For me?

393
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,234
Thank you.

394
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,110
This <i>is</i> a <i>Hoyo de Monterrey.</i>

395
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,711
An aromatic Habano.

396
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,758
Light flavor,

397
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,911
but elegant and complex.

398
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,878
Harvested by brave men

399
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,910
and hand-rolled tenderly
by beautiful women on their thighs.

400
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,473
So what do you want?
You need advice again?

401
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,318
It's almost winter, Professor!

402
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,077
I wrote down my dreams,
the parts I could remember,

403
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,799
but it's not getting better.

404
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,236
I dance with the world's prettiest girl.

405
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,920
And the next minute she's gone.
Disappeared.

406
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,479
Like she never existed.

407
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,910
You know, women are like cigars.

408
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,039
If you pull at them too hard,
they won't give you any pleasure.

409
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,430
But I didn't even pull at her.

410
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,751
I didn't even touch her.

411
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,752
We just danced.

412
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,597
It's winter,
you mustn't put your health at risk.

413
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,079
At my age there is little risk of health.

414
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,153
You haven't tried the wool scarf
my mother knit.

415
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,959
You don't know her name, or where she lives,
your tooth gap gal?

416
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,198
And you don't know anyone who knows her?

417
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,995
Hello.

418
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,589
Can I help you?

419
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,116
There was a fair this fall.
I sat here with a Bohemian girl,

420
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,636
she spoke to you in Czech.
Remember her?

421
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,713
It depends.

422
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,756
Just one little question.

423
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,992
It has to be very little question.

424
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,714
Come here!

425
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,798
I need her address.

426
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,432
It's so hard

427
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,832
to remember.

428
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,158
Is it easier now?

429
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,353
Why this cheap floozy?

430
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,959
She's not cheap.

431
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,238
I hear different.

432
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,438
Why always so aggressive because women?

433
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,951
May I have the address now?

434
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,269
Stubborn as ox!

435
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,794
Second district,

436
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,798
Rotensterngasse.

437
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,474
Follow the rats, house number 11.

438
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,469
Thank you.

439
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,511
Excuse me.

440
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,755
Does a young woman from Bohemia live here?

441
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,309
Thank you.

442
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,758
Excuse me.
Does a young woman from Bohemia live here?

443
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,431
The sonny with the cute tushy!

444
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,156
You can pay me meal and mug of beer,
sonny!

445
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,230
Good!

446
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,357
Thanks for invitation, sonny!
- My name's Franz.

447
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,318
Yes! You from Attersee!

448
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,914
And you?

449
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,680
Anezka.

450
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,470
Come from Dobrovice.

451
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,512
Beautiful village,

452
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,240
snuggle up to hill like to dark lover.

453
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,680
Doesn't it taste good?

454
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,475
Yes, it does.

455
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,752
You do have money?

456
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,553
Of course. Why?

457
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,192
What kind of work do you do?
- This and that.

458
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,033
Nanny, cook, household help,

459
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,593
And the other women?

460
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,279
All Bohemian.

461
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,193
Beautiful good women, all together.

462
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,954
Only problem,

463
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,675
no official permit.

464
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,874
Some go amuse gentlemen.

465
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,230
But that not for me. Because,

466
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,510
gentleman, poor or rich,

467
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,313
is not always gentleman.

468
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,915
Understand?
- Yes.

469
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,037
I know what you mean.

470
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,789
And now I want you, sonny!

471
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,633
Wait, I do it.

472
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,714
Anezka!

473
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,159
I'll show you!

474
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,472
Boom, dead!

475
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,197
What you do with nose?

476
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,749
Got in a fight. Over you.

477
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,594
Over me? Is true?

478
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,470
Why did you run away that day?

479
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,072
Sometimes have to run away,
sometimes have to stay.

480
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,554
So is life.

481
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,558
Yes, that might be true, but...

482
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,117
Not talk so much.

483
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,793
Better to screw again.
Went little fast first time.

484
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,954
Not here. Working.

485
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,639
Again? And tomorrow?

486
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,429
Not here tomorrow too, not here all week.

487
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,114
Can leave it here.

488
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,314
<i>My dear Franz], thank you so much
for the lovely Christmas card.</i>

489
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,195
Let's see. A little to the right.

490
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,637
<i>Our pastor took my photo.</i>

491
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,279
No, my right.

492
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,195
<i>To thank me for the apple
strudel I gave him.</i>

493
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,280
That's good. Now smile, Gretl.

494
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,112
<i>With all my heart,
I wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

495
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,313
<i>and a blessed New Year.</i>

496
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,755
<i>Yours, Mama.</i>

497
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,350
<i>PS: If your trousers get dirty,
you can send them to me.</i>

498
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,912
<i>PPS:</i>

499
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,353
<i>Are you still in love?</i>

500
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,874
<i>Dear Mama,</i>

501
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,079
<i>Christmas is over and I've been in the city
for a while now.</i>

502
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,269
<i>But everything seems stranger and stranger.</i>

503
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,795
<i>Maybe our Whole life is like that:</i>

504
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,630
<i>From when we're born, we move away,
bit by bit, day by day, from ourselves,</i>

505
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,518
<i>until we don't know anything anymore.</i>

506
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,760
<i>Is this really how it is?</i>

507
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,276
<i>I wonder, and send you lots of love,
Yours, Franz.</i>

508
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,711
<i>PS: My trousers are not dirty.</i>

509
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,477
<i>PPS: I am still in love.</i>

510
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,073
What's wrong with you? You look awful

511
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,274
move like an old man. Keep this up and
you can apply for retirement next year.

512
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,869
Hello there, Professor!

513
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,673
Good day.

514
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,710
I'm returning this, thank you.

515
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,756
It's freshly washed and ironed
and smells like a rose bush.

516
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,389
The ladies did their best.

517
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,996
Please thank them for me.

518
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,512
What's the matter with you?

519
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,914
You didn't find her?

520
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,389
I did.

521
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,394
Her name is Anezka.

522
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,434
A Bohemian?

523
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,869
Yes.

524
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,072
From a village that snuggles up to a hill

525
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,710
like to a dark lover.

526
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,874
A N” like a dark lover?

527
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,198
Bohemian cuisine is wonderful.

528
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,559
Yes, wonderful.

529
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,792
You're speaking in monosyllables today.

530
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,599
What happened between you and this Anezka?

531
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,398
I touched her.

532
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,675
It was the most beautiful experience.

533
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,719
I'm glad.

534
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,710
I hope she touched you as well.

535
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,279
Oh, yes.

536
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,590
And then she disappeared.

537
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,999
Again?

538
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,355
I tried everything, but...

539
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,391
Your cigars, Professor.

540
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,115
Oh, I almost forgot them.

541
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,829
Thank you.

542
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,194
I wish

543
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,035
you a lovely day.
- Goodbye, Professor.

544
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,195
Now you listen to me, boy!

545
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,633
You don't just let a woman walk away.

546
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,995
I made that mistake once.

547
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,351
I'm giving you the day off.

548
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,079
Go now,

549
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,031
stand in front of her house

550
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,517
and wait till you see her!
And when she comes,

551
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,391
and she's with another guy,

552
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,832
then you strike him down
with a wet washrag.

553
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,790
Or should I lend you a crutch?
- No, but thanks.

554
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,432
If you're gonna put down roots,
do it elsewhere!

555
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,319
One show please.
- One schilling.

556
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,314
Free choice of seats, no intermission,
enjoy yourself.

557
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,192
Dear God, strike me dumb,
so Dachau won't be where I come.

558
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,238
Dear God, strike me deaf,
so I'll believe we have a future left.

559
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,153
Dear God, strike me blind,
so I'm in a wonderful frame of mind.

560
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,635
What will it be?
- A beer.

561
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,189
I'm

562
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,477
the German Reich Chancellor

563
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,030
and am hungry

564
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,794
as a wolf!

565
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,991
Serve me

566
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,189
my Austrian homeland!

567
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,470
I will devour Austria!

568
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,156
Choke on it!

569
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,389
Sit!

570
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,155
Good Adi, good doggie.

571
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,434
Ladies and Gentlemen,

572
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,271
an international sensation.

573
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,910
In the endless expanse of the prairie,

574
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,596
where the coyote howls, the eagle swirls,

575
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,156
and buffalo herds graze, we have found her:

576
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,554
naked and defenseless,

577
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,155
without taboos, without shame.

578
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,269
This evening, here and now, welcome:

579
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,598
N'Djina, a shy beauty
from the land of Indians!

580
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,754
Stop, or I'll slit you open!

581
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,997
Put it away, Heinzi!

582
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,832
I know him.

583
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,999
Must talk with him.

584
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,440
Alone.

585
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,992
I don't know you.

586
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,429
And it's better not to get to know me.

587
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,754
You know what I mean?

588
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,158
I saw you.

589
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,077
You follow me in secret.

590
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,393
Was nice the show?

591
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,591
What's with you and that Heinzi?

592
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,951
He colleague. Have fun and cabaret.

593
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,634
Not just a knife in his pants, right?

594
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,474
Some have in pants, some not.

595
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,236
Ask stupid question,
get stupid answer, sonny.

596
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,750
I'm not sonny, my name is Franz!

597
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,753
Here's three schillings
to show me your ass again.

598
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,156
Right here in this courtyard.

599
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,073
Sorry.

600
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,631
We all have to live, sonny.

601
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,634
Anezka.

602
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,195
I'm ashamed of everything.
My legs. My neck.

603
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,958
Of the sweat stains under my arms.

604
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,156
I'm ashamed of everything that I have,
that I do, that I am.

605
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,709
Don't you ever feel desire?

606
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,551
Don't you ever feel a sense of pleasure?

607
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,917
Mrs. Buccleton?

608
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,200
I feel pleasure in eating.

609
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,676
...big pieces of cake.

610
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,190
You know, Mrs. Buccleton,
pleasure and shame are siblings.

611
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,355
It seems to me, in your case,
one of the siblings

612
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,470
has been somewhat neglected.

613
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,878
You think so?

614
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,357
Yes, I think so.

615
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,878
What can I do to help the poor thing?

616
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,479
Stop eating cake!

617
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,758
How long have you been
sitting on this bench?

618
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,674
Don't know. Maybe two hours.

619
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,879
Did it occur to you to ring the doorbell?
It might make things a lot easier.

620
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,954
I did think of that,
but didn't dare disturb you.

621
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,795
I'll tell you when you're disturbing me.

622
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,319
This is a wonderful cigar!

623
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,712
Our meetings are getting expensive for you.

624
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:10,512
Latest news:
Sunday. the referendum on Austria's freedom.

625
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,950
Maybe love is not for me.

626
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,515
Or maybe I'm not cut out for love.

627
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,596
Do you love her, this Anezka?

628
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,319
Or is it just your libido?

629
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,674
My what?

630
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,831
It's responsible for joy and pain and,

631
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,316
to put it simply,
it's what men have in their pants...

632
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,478
You too?

633
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,639
I've gotten over my libido, ages ago.

634
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,278
Gentlemen, I apologize,
it's because of the bombs.

635
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,394
And other objects not tolerated
by the municipality.

636
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,271
What kind of objects?

637
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,839
I can't say.

638
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,470
I'll know when I find one of them.

639
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,715
Love, libido...

640
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,633
I don't know.

641
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,871
Actually, I don't know anything.

642
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,359
Anyway. It's the first step
in the steep stairwell of Wisdom.

643
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:34,512
Now Hitler is marching into Vienna.
People here will greet him enthusiastically.

644
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,828
Austria lies before him
like a huge schnitzel,

645
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:42,343
he'll eat it up with
a ravenous appetite.

646
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,878
Stop thinking about love.

647
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,429
<i>This morning at 5:30 a.m., German troops
crossed the border at Salzburg.</i>

648
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:10,077
<i>Without resistance from the Austrian army
they advance towards the capital, Vienna.</i>

649
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,151
He's up there!

650
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,070
Come on!

651
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,236
What's he doing up there?

652
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,237
Hey, come down!

653
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,953
"LONG LIVE AUSTRIA"

654
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,910
"Freedom of the people
calls for freedom of the heart"

655
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,236
Thank you.

656
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,836
The intervention of courageous
Viennese citizens, yesterday

657
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,356
prevented a cowardly attack
on the new freedom of the spirit.

658
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,272
Freedom of the spirit...

659
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,077
Known in certain circles as 'Red Egon'
notorious Bolshevik Hubert Panstingl

660
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,318
unfurled a banner on the roof
of an apartment building,

661
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,314
attempting to insult our Reich and people
in the most offensive way.

662
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,718
Brave residents and pedestrians
asked the man to hand over the banner.

663
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,872
He responded by threatening them
with a weapon,

664
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,920
and lost his balance in the process.

665
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,998
What a pack of lies!

666
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:23,109
<i>Freedom of the people
calls for freedom of the heart.</i>

667
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,549
<i>Dear Mama!</i>

668
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,393
<i>It's beautiful here in Vienna.</i>

669
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,916
<i>Everything is blossoming,
the parks look like postcards</i>

670
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,795
<i>out of the horse droppings,
primroses are sprouting.</i>

671
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,951
Send her my love.

672
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,312
<i>Crazy people,
running around like headless chickens</i>

673
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,914
<i>they haven't got a clue.</i>

674
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,395
I'll show you.
- What will you show me?

675
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,710
Beat it.
- I dare you to do it.

676
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,594
<i>If you ask me,
it's not just because it's spring.</i>

677
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,512
<i>It's mostly due to politics.</i>

678
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,478
<i>These are strange times.</i>

679
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,950
<i>Or maybe the times were always strange,</i>

680
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,196
<i>and I just didn't notice.</i>

681
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,716
<i>Until recently, I was just a child.</i>

682
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,078
<i>And I'm not yet a man.
That's the predicament I'm in.</i>

683
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,439
<i>My dear Franz]!</i>

684
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,989
<i>Guess what? Hitler's hanging on the pub
and school walls now.</i>

685
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,192
<i>Right next to Jesus.</i>

686
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,478
<i>Yet no one knows
What they think of each other.</i>

687
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,196
<i>The mayor is a Nazi now.</i>

688
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,278
<i>Suddenly everyone wants to be a Nazi.</i>

689
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,796
<i>Even the forester wears a bright red armband
in the woods</i>

690
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,236
<i>and wonders why he hasn't shot anything.</i>

691
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,074
<i>Oh, Franz],</i>

692
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,074
<i>my dear boy,</i>

693
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,551
<i>Where does this end?</i>

694
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,877
<i>Preininger is dead,</i>

695
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,998
<i>and you are so far away.</i>

696
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,234
Herr Leopold.
- Come on!

697
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,313
ObersturmbannfUhrer Garleitner
won't like this.

698
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,314
Obersturm... what...?

699
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,070
ObersturmbannfUhrer Garleitner from Linz.

700
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,958
He and I...

701
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,514
<i>Sometimes I lie in bed
and cry in my pillow,</i>

702
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,759
<i>'cause there's no one here anymore
I can take care of.</i>

703
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,435
Franz!

704
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,918
Jew lover!

705
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,792
Communist pig!

706
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,153
Heil Hitler!

707
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:09,639
THE JEW BUYS HERE!

708
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,398
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

709
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,597
It's interesting
how little you can talk in one day.

710
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,879
Herr Trsnyek?

711
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,073
We're closed.

712
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,034
That doesn't bother us.

713
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,196
Otto Trsnyek, you are under arrest.

714
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,551
For possession and distribution
of pornographic material.

715
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,314
So, where do you hide the wank mags?

716
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,679
The jack-off-booklets.
- I didn't hide anything.

717
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,075
I get it.

718
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,320
"Under the counter goods" as you call them.

719
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,069
So, bend under the counter, pal!

720
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,634
Interesting.

721
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,957
Who do you sell this stuff to?

722
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,714
Your Jewish and communist buddies?

723
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,679
The booklets belong to me!
- Shut up!

724
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,480
I bought them.
- Shut your trap, you idiot!

725
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,200
We're not in the barrack yard!

726
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,116
Why yell at your apprentice like that!

727
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,393
You're my apprentice!

728
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,634
So do exactly as I say now!

729
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,273
Sit down and keep your trap shut!

730
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,280
Leave it to me!

731
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,518
Leave me alone.

732
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,513
Where are you from?

733
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,277
Attersee.
- Really?

734
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,715
Me too.

735
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,599
It's nice there.

736
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,758
It's the times, sonny.

737
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,116
Look, you'd just be ruining your future.

738
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,476
I'm not sonny.
My name's Franz Huchel.

739
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,797
Are you still in business?

740
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,356
Of course, Herr Jurist.

741
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,350
<i>Dear Mama, I have some unpleasant news.</i>

742
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,869
<i>Otto Trsnyek has gotten sick.</i>

743
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,750
<i>It's his liver,
or kidneys or some other innards.</i>

744
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,035
<i>He's in the hospital for a few days,
and has to wait and see.</i>

745
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,035
Hello.

746
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,554
Hello, Frau Veithammer.

747
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,792
<i>The Illustrierte Wochenpost</i>

748
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,953
and a pack of Egyptians, please.
- Of course.

749
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,514
I shouldn't smoke so much.

750
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,513
What's the point of life,
without a little pleasure?

751
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,909
You're right, Herr Franz.

752
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,752
I've just come from the cemetery.

753
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,954
Where's Herr Trsnyek?

754
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,350
Took a trip. He'll be back soon.

755
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,759
Do you know where they take
the people they've arrested?

756
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,552
Hello.
- Heil Hitler!

757
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,840
I'd like information
on the whereabouts of the innocent

758
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,799
but still taken away
or arrested

759
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,271
or abducted tobacconist Otto Trsnyek.

760
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,835
Information of this sort is not given out.

761
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,276
But...
- No buts.

762
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,793
You'd better leave!
Or you'll end up staying here longer!

763
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,238
Could you at least give Herr Trsnyek
his crutches? He really needs them!

764
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,674
Can I count on that?

765
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,237
Hail Hitler.
And don't ever show up here again.

766
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,475
How can I help you?

767
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,511
I'd like to speak to the Professor.

768
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,392
My husband doesn't see patients anymore.

769
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,274
I'm not here as a patient, but as

770
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,199
a close acquaintance.

771
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,197
Sorry?

772
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,631
He said to ring the bell next time!
And it's urgent.

773
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,632
It's alright, Mama. Come in!

774
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,597
A visitor for you, Papa.

775
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,672
Just a moment.

776
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,469
Franz.

777
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,670
Should we take a little walk?

778
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,478
Yes, Professor.

779
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,240
You shouldn't leave the house anymore.

780
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,873
Why not?

781
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,870
You know Why.
- No, I don't.

782
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,517
I absolutely need some fresh air, Martha.

783
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,512
Or I'll turn into a fossil

784
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,679
and end up, without anyone noticing,
in my own collection of antiques.

785
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,310
In London you could walk around freely.

786
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,669
Stop pestering me about London!

787
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,070
So, what's brought you to me?

788
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,519
The Bohemian gal again?

789
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,670
No.

790
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,155
They didn't even let him take his crutches.

791
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,273
That's bad.

792
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,273
You drink coffee?

793
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,749
Today I do.

794
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,835
Hello, Josef.

795
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,789
Professor, let's try to find you something
more secluded today.

796
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,918
Follow me, please. Thank you.

797
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,514
What can I get you?

798
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,355
Two <i>Verléngerte</i> please!
- My pleasure, Professor. Coming right up.

799
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,876
Why did your wife mention London?

800
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,476
Are you planning on travelling?
♪ Travelling", that's good!

801
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,999
My two ladies want to emigrate.
They're frightened.

802
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,997
And rightly so.

803
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,877
Yes, but your country is your country,
and home is home, my Mama always says.

804
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,071
You should meet her.
I think you two would get along well.

805
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,358
Mama knows a lot about people
and their crazy ways,

806
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,909
you'd have plenty to talk about.

807
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,671
And she can also bake potato strudel.

808
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,156
A real, honest to goodness one.

809
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,237
Voila gentlemen, two Verléngerte.

810
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,637
How about dessert?
- No, thank you.

811
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,754
Where did I leave off?

812
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,398
With a real and honest to goodness
potato strudel.

813
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,830
Made in an iron pan, with fresh butter.

814
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:45,920
With or without lentils,
with or without greaves, you like it.

815
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,879
I don't think I've ever talked this much.
- Keep on talking, my friend.

816
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,836
Listening is my specialty.

817
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,110
Good?

818
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,789
Very good.

819
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,429


820
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,831
Don't want to leave!

821
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,749
Pardon me.

822
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,115
Pardon me.

823
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,475
Pardon me.

824
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,195

01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,838
like a clerk...

828
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,031
Hello, Frau Dr.
- Good-morning,

829
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,397
I need a cigarette holder.
- One moment please.

830
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,279
My dear husband
knocked the old one out of my mouth.

831
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,398
That wasn't very nice.
- No, not very.

832
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,310
But he did pay for two jacket crowns.
That was nice.

833
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,715
Very good.

834
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,674
And a pack of <i>Gloriettes.</i>

It's fine. Franz, right?

837
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,598
Thank you very much, Frau Dr.

838
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,439
You again!
I can't leak information, you know that!

839
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,473
The crutches! You promised...

840
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,519
I didn't promise anything.
Now get lost!

841
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,957
Before you land in the cellar too.
- So, he's in the cellar?

842
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,272
Take me to Herrn Trsnyek immediately.

843
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,233
Sonny, sonny.

01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,878
I have a guy here

01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,874

<i>Often, though, I'm sad, but don't know why.</i>

<i>Sometimes I wish I was back at the lake.</i>

<i>Of course I know it's not that easy.</i>

suddenly the roots snap and the Ferris Wheel
rolls over the city

and crushes everything..."
What's that supposed to mean?

871
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,872
Nothing.
- Nothing?

You smeared and vandalized
his tobacco shop.

You insulted and denounced him.

Thank you for your advice.
- Good advice.

895
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,709
We will leave Vienna.

01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,989
I have to stay and take care of the shop.

897
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,990
Of course you do.

898
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,836
But other than that

899
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,513
is there anything or anyone else
keeping you in Vienna?

900
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,471
Is the Indian girl still around?

901
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,475
Her act is almost over.
Tickets are only 50 groschen now.

902
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,639
A ship full of Jews is sinking.

903
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,430
What's so bad about that?

904
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,190
One of them could swim.

905
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,909
What's the difference
between a Jew and a tumor?

906
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,957
There isn't any!
- There is.

907
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,557
A tumor can be benign.

908
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,232
And now, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy

909
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,718
the magical Massimo
and his gorgeous assistant.

910
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,519
Sonny!

911
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,717
Where did tooth go?
- I don't know.

912
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,871
You look like me now.

913
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,394
Yours is nicer.

914
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,513
Where's Heinzi?

915
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,194
Gone. Took him.
By Gestapo.

916
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,635
Why?

917
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,559
Because of jokes.

918
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,599
Did you get a package yet?

919
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,033
What kind package?

920
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,554
Anezka,

921
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,156
I've thought it over,
let's go away together, the two of us,

922
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,791
some place, where it's quiet,

923
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,038
to Bohemia, for all I care,
behind the dark hill,

924
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,551
or to Salzkammergut.

925
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,551
My Mama certainly won't object.

926
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,991
I could open a tobacco shop,

927
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,318
and we could get married.

928
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,035
Just like that.

929
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,951
I no can go away from here.

930
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,318
Please leave us alone!

931
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,679
So that's what it is.

932
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,954
Yes.

933
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,351
Life is what it is.

934
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,277
What sort of life?

935
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,479
<i>Dear Franz],</i>

936
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,676
<i>I'm sorry it didn't work outwith the girl.</i>

937
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,514
<i>Sometimes you need to let one thing go,</i>

938
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,677
<i>for another to come.</i>

939
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,113
<i>Are you eating enough?</i>

940
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,917
<i>My dear, dear boy,</i>

941
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,839
<i>I hold you forever in my heart.</i>

942
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,718
<i>Yours, Mama.</i>

943
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,958
Where are you rushing off to?

944
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,749
In there.

945
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,235
Visiting somebody?

946
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,070
Professor Freud.
- Why?

947
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,629
I have his theater tickets. Burgtheater.

948
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,351
No performances for Jews.
Not today, not tomorrow.

949
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,513
And now piss off!

950
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,993
Is the Professor here?

951
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,349
Come in!

952
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,749
This way.

953
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,797
What are you doing in my trousers?

954
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,394
I came through the coal cellar,
'cause the Gestapo's outside.

955
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,239
The Gestapo?

956
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,754
Professor.

957
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,398
One for now,

958
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,393
one for the journey,

959
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,597
and one for England.

960
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,433
Thank you.

961
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:43,271
Have you ever held anything this marvelous,
this wonderful,

962
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,798
so perfect in its imperfection

963
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,435
between your teeth?

964
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,111
Then it's high time, my friend.

965
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,714
Sit down!

966
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,356
On the couch?
- Yes.

967
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,911
All our chairs are either

968
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,873
shipped off

969
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,593
or are being sat upon by some

970
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:23,357
staunch Nationalists' asses.

971
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,070
I'm not sure, Professor.

972
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,357
I've never tried it.

973
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,793
New worlds are created just by trying.

974
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,195
Good.

975
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,799
Here you go, gentlemen.
- Thanks, Anna.

976
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,760
Maybe it was all one huge mistake.

977
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,754
Love is always a mistake.

978
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,918
Back when I boarded the train in Schbrfling,

979
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,750
my heart ached.

980
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,117
And when Anezka ran away,

981
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:36,398
ten doctors couldn't have cured me.

982
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,430
But at least I knew what I wanted.

983
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,279
Now, the pain's almost gone,
but I'm clueless.

984
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,034
I feel like a boat
that's lost its oars in a storm

985
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,077
drifting, stupidly, from here to there.

986
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,913
And my dreams!

987
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:54,151
I don't know where they're all coming from.
I can't imagine

988
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:58,712
that such strange things
can grow by themselves in my head.

989
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,879
We're not in this world to find answers,

990
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,918
but to ask questions.

991
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,791
Only with a great deal of courage

992
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,957
or persistence

993
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,912
or stupidity,

994
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,790
preferably, all three at once,

995
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,032
do we manage, here and there,

996
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,310
to make a mark.

997
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,075
A mark.

998
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,192
You'll come back from England, Professor?

999
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,875
Won't you?

1000
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,439
Professor?

1001
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,749
Leave me alone, Anna!

1002
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,398
I can do it myself.

1003
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,114
<i>Dear Franz].</i>

1004
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,838
<i>Remember Hannes, our pleasure steamer?</i>

1005
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,874
<i>They've renamed and repainted it.</i>

1006
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:30,078
<i>It shines like a sucked piece of candy</i>

1007
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,998
<i>and is called Homecoming.</i>

1008
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,992
<i>Probably meaning the return to the Reich.</i>

1009
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:41,273
<i>However, during the first voyage under the
new name, the diesel motor exploded,</i>

1010
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,149
<i>and they had to use row boats
to bring everyone back to shore.</i>

1011
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,120
<i>Why don't you write anymore, my boy?</i>

1012
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,079
<i>Did something happen?</i>

1013
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,197
I was wondering Why I never saw
your ObersturmbannfUhrer here?

1014
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,510
So I asked around.

1015
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,916
In all of Upper Austria there's not
a single Obersturmbannfilhrer Garleitner.

1016
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,319
Keep your hands off me!

1017
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,354
I quit.

1018
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:19,440
<i>Dear Mother,</i>

1019
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:23,031
<i>a boy has a Mama, but a man has a Mother,</i>

1020
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,236
<i>I'd rather have sent you a card,</i>

1021
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,109
<i>but some words can't go with pictures
and need an envelope.</i>

1022
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,909
<i>Yesterday, Otto Trsnyek died.</i>

1023
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,470
<i>His heart simply stopped.</i>

1024
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,911
<i>Maybe it just didn't want to carry on,
in these times.</i>

1025
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,320
<i>Please dear Mama, don't be sad.</i>

1026
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,836
<i>Or go ahead and be sad.</i>

1027
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,435
<i>Otto Trsnyek deserves it.</i>

1028
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,439
<i>Yours, Franz.</i>

1029
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,199
This doesn't make sense anymore, sonny.

1030
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,591
What makes sense or doesn't
is yet to be determined.

1031
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,559
And, by the way, my name is Franz.
Franz Huchel.

1032
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:11,109
Can I close up?
- The key belongs to us now.

1033
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,391
<i>The geraniums glow in the night.</i>

1034
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,029
<i>As dawn breaks, the dark lover rises</i>

1035
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,396
<i>and disappears in the bat of an eye.</i>

1036
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,996
<i>On a swing,
the Bohemian girl flies into the air.</i>

1037
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,555
<i>Her dress is light and white,
like wisps of cloud.</i>

1038
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,673
<i>She laughs and falls smack into my heart.</i>
