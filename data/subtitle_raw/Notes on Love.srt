<i>Indifferent.</i>

2
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,670
<i>Indifferent.</i>

3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,119
<i>Bloody indifferent.</i>

4
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,592
<i>I am not wise.</i>

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,397
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,592
<i>Can't be bothered t0 do anything.</i>

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,797
<i>I don't know how t0 get a grip.</i>

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,552
<i>My head is broken.</i>

9
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,276
<i>My body sinks t0 the ground.</i>

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,079
<i>My hand is a strange object.</i>

11
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>Disorder.</i>

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,910
<i>Chaos.</i>

13
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,238
<i>I remove the sheet of paper
from the typewriter.</i>

14
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,713
<i>It's an action.</i>

15
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,319
<i>I smoke a cigarette.</i>

NOTES ON LOVE

A FILM BY JQRGEN LETH

18
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,400
I smoke a cigarette.

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,998
I think about you.

20
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,318
I think about your knees.

21
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,479
The way it feels
when I hold you behind your knee.

22
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,913
I smoke a cigarette.

23
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,589
I smoke a cigarette.

24
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,479
When it rains, it rains.

25
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,232
When it's warm, it's warm.

26
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,632
When it's dark, it's dark.

27
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,270
When I close my eyes
and imagine you, -

28
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,634
- softly, I stroke
your neck and throat.

29
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,432
I can feel your belly, -

30
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,439
- your nipples, -

31
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,998
- and the warmth in your armpits.

32
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,959
And I imagine -

33
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,471
- that this is how you are.

34
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,513
Only this.

35
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,032
And I wonder -

36
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,358
- if I can open my eyes -

37
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,393
- and love you -

38
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,755
- at the same time.

39
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,158
<i>I travel t0 the islands
t0 begin somewhere.</i>

40
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,556
<i>T0 begin somewhere.</i>

41
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,793
<i>70 years ago,
Malinowski was here.</i>

42
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,118
<i>He slept in his tent.</i>

43
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,278
<i>He woke up in the morning.</i>

44
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,040
<i>He spoke with the natives.</i>

45
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,438
<i>He collected his material.</i>

46
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,397
<i>He wanted t0 describe love.</i>

47
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,160
<i>That was his project.</i>

48
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,920
<i>Malinowski is my hero.</i>

49
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,517
Ask them to look this way.

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,080
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms </i>
Bossa Nova rhythms.

51
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,079
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.</i>

52
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,234
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at</i>

53
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,958
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.</i>

54
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,313
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't </i>

55
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,394
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.</i>

56
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,276
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.</i>

57
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,989
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
Id0n't mind no.</i>

58
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,717
<i>Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.</i>

59
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,350
Bossa Nova rhythms
I don't mind at all.

60
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,833
I can tell you exactly
what I am doing to you.

61
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,874
I am holding you in my arms.
I am kissing you.

62
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,789
I am holding your body
against my body.

63
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,038
And I won't let you go.

64
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,358
That is what I am doing to you.

65
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,758
Tell me
what you are doing to me.

66
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,958
What are you doing to me?

67
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,196
It's more than one aperture.

68
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,596
- It's clear now.
- I can see that.

69
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,911
- Is there a long clear stretch?
- Yes, with one cloud in between.

70
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,269
It was completely clear just before.

71
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,029
- And also now, right?
- No.

72
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,989
I'm taking my jacket off.

73
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,118
I'm putting it on again.

74
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,718
I remember we were standing
in front of the mirror.

75
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,036
Your body.

76
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,471
I'm caressing it.

77
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,956
I'm kissing you.

78
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,834
I like your body.

79
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,919
Are you there now?

80
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,357
We have to end it.

81
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,709
I love you.

82
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,070
I love you.

83
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,198
<i>I can feel my body
on the rivers.</i>

84
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,237
<i>Everything is just right.</i>

85
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,877
<i>My foot is where it should be.</i>

86
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,550
<i>My hand is calm.</i>

87
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,635
<i>Through the rivers
I penetrate the land.</i>

88
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,671
<i>I lie back</i> -

89
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,589
<i>- and forget everything.</i>

90
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,553
I like it when you say it to me.

91
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,920
I like it when you say
that I am your woman.

92
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,832
And action.

93
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,350
I like it when you say it to me.

94
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:37,711
I like it when you say
that I am your woman.

95
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,790
That I am your woman.

96
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,230
That I am your

97
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,670
woman.

98
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,239
And action.

99
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,990
I like it when you say it to me.

100
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,037
I like it when you say
that I am your woman.

101
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,960
I am your woman.

102
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,152
Tell me what you're thinking about.

103
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,954
Tell me your thoughts.

104
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,278
<i>Tell me what you're thinking about.</i>

105
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,791
<i>Tell me your thoughts.</i>

106
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,073
I wasn't really thinking.

107
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,591
I wasn't really thinking.

108
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,714
I was listening
to the sound of your voice.

109
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,197
I was listening to the sound
of your voice.
