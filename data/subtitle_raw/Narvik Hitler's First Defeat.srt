00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:35,250
NORWAY DECLARES NEUTRALITY
WHEN WORLD WAR II BREAKS OUT

2
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:49,291
SWEDEN DELIVERS 85% OF THE IRON ORE
USED BY THE GERMAN WEAPONS INDUSTRY

3
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:55,250
THE ORE IS TRANSPORTED BY TRAIN ACROSS
THE BORDER AND SHIPPED OUT FROM NARVIK

4
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:12,041
GREAT BRITAIN CONSIDERS STOPPING THE ORE
TO BE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE

5
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:20,500
ON APRIL 81940, THE BRITISH MARINE FORCE
MINE NORWEGIAN WATERS

6
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:26,125
BRITISH AND NAZIS
LOAD ORE IN NORWAY SIDE BY SIDE

7
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:30,333
BATTLE FOR IRON ORE
HECTIC DAYS AT PORT OF NARVIK

8
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:35,625
THAT DAY, A TROOP OF NORWEGIAN SOLDIERS
ARE SENT TO NARVIK AS NEUTRALITY GUARDS

9
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:41,250
THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT NORWAY'S
NEUTRALITY HAS ALREADY BEEN BREACHED

10
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,208
Do you smell that?

11
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,166
Yes, now I got it!

12
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,500
- Got what?
- The smell.

13
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,958
Saltwater?

14
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,083
There's something more.

15
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,500
You don't smell it?

16
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,708
Nope.

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,958
Then you're not a local.

18
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,791
It's ore. Iron ore.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,291
The smell of money.

20
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,375
Soldiers, listen up.

21
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,208
All leave is cancelled.

22
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,458
Captain?

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
It's my son's birthday.

24
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,791
Everyone must go to the camp.

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,625
Corporal, be back by midnight.

26
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,583
Thank you, major.

27
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,375
Take this.

28
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,250
How did you manage that?

29
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,583
- I'm not a donkey.
- Don't make me order you.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,500
Give Bjorg my best.

31
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,000
Bjorg?

32
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,500
Do you know who you are?

33
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm coming!

34
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,666
Our ore...

35
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,541
contains more iron than any other.

36
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,708
That's why

37
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,000
it is sought after, all over the world.

38
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,625
Today, when we present the plans
for our new ore wharf,

39
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,750
you can see for yourselves,

40
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,083
that there is enough room for you all.

41
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,375
I can guarantee it.

42
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,666
German and English industry

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,208
have one thing in common
with us here in little Narvik.

44
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,625
You all profit

45
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,958
greatly from the peace

46
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,791
- and security of our harbour.
- Security of

47
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
our harbour.

48
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,875
- And we are happy about that.
- And...

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,083
But unfortunately,
it has come to my attention

50
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,166
that several ships,

51
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,791
both German and English,

52
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,916
have been sunk

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,416
- ...after leaving port.
- Excuse me.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,750
This affects all of us.

55
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,125
Since there are representatives

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,750
from both English and German
authorities here today,

57
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,833
I would ask you

58
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,583
to speak with your governments
about an agreement

59
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,541
which guarantees safe passage

60
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,791
for all ships

61
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,958
of all nations.

62
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,833
...so that the ore
makes it safely to its destination.

63
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,916
Well...

64
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,708
Your mayor thinks too highly of me.

65
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,000
Consul Wussow.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,958
- Cheers!
- Let me refill your drink.

67
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,041
To Narvik!

68
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,791
Consul Ross.

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,416
Cheers.

70
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,333
To Narvik!

71
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,041
- To Narvik!
- To Narvik!

72
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,666
Hansen says, "Hi!"

73
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,291
Say, "Hi!" back.

74
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,125
You're finished now, right?

75
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,166
Soon.

76
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,603
We were transferred to the town today.

77
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,541
Did they say why?

78
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,250
So I can be close to you, of course.

79
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,666
Hello! We have to serve.

80
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,833
Yes.

81
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,791
Someone is going to be happy to see you.

82
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,458
Yes? Where is he?

83
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,291
Outside, with your dad.

84
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,208
Ingrid?

85
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,791
I have to be back by midnight.

86
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,142
You can't leave until I finish work.

87
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,333
So hurry.

88
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,458
Are you ready?

89
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,833
And one more.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,208
Look who's coming.

91
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,458
Daddy!

92
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,666
Hey. You...

93
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,833
- You're as heavy as a five-year old.
- I'm six.

94
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,125
Are you six?

95
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
Then this must be for you.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,250
A locomotive!

97
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,375
A locomotive.

98
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,708
How are you?

99
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,708
I'm fine.

100
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Let me see.

101
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it nice?

102
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,708
So Gunnar is back?

103
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,500
Only for tonight.
So I came to ask if I could...

104
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,500
<i>Reuters has been informed
from authoritative sources in London</i>

105
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,625
<i>that the mining in Norwegian waters
was completed in one hour,</i>

106
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,791
<i>without involvement from any others,
it has said.</i>

107
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,333
Thank God we have the English.

108
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,296
<i>During the afternoon and night,
there have been reports of the torpedoing</i>

109
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,916
<i>of three German ships
off the Norwegian coast.</i>

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,625
<i>Both warring parties have...</i>

111
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,541
Someone has to put a stop to that Hitler.

112
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:52,958
<i>This was the news.</i>

113
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,791
He wanted to finish building.
I didn't have the heart to...

114
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,750
I'll take Ole and go to bed.

115
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
Thank you.

116
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,875
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,041
Good night.

118
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,166
By the way, as I told Ingrid,

119
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,250
I'm happy to make up a bunkbed.

120
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,291
Good night, Dad.

121
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

122
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,708
Hey.

123
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,875
I have to leave

124
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,083
- in half an hour.
- I know.

125
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,500
I know. We have time.

126
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,916
He's the one talking about the bunkbed.

127
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,708
Gunnar?

128
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,041
- Did you hear that?
- No.

129
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,958
No. You have no idea
how much trouble I'm in.

130
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,000
I should have been back there
over four hours ago.

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,708
You can blame me.

132
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,916
- When are you back?
- Tonight.

133
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,875
Unless I'm arrested.

134
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,166
I love you.

135
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,750
Take care of yourself.

136
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,791
Colonel, sir.

137
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,916
Why aren't you armed?

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,291
I've...

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,375
I've been on leave.

140
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,958
I'm supposed to defend the town with this?

141
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,375
Our ships

142
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,541
have been sunk.

143
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,833
Marines scattered all over the harbor.

144
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:12,125
<i>German warships passed
the Oslofjord fortress tonight</i>

145
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,583
<i>after engaging
with the fortress' batteries,</i>

146
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,375
<i>and continued onwards.</i>

147
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,500
<i>German warships have also,
while battling the fortress,</i>

148
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,708
<i>entered Bergen, which is now occupied.</i>

149
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,125
<i>One ship has entered Narvik,</i>

150
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,791
<i>most likely after a battle
with Norwegian vessels,</i>

151
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,583
<i>and landed a smaller force.</i>

152
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,416
<i>No further details.</i>

153
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,083
Has a ship really been sunk?

154
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,416
- Magne? Where's my equipment?
- What?

155
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,833
Where's my equipment?

156
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,541
Back at camp.

157
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,208
In position and awaiting your order.

158
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,416
Withdraw!

159
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,625
Or we will shoot!

160
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,708
That is not going to happen!

161
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,892
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with.

162
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,958
No! I'm doing this alone.

163
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,291
Pull yourself together.

164
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,083
So many dead.

165
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,750
Was that really necessary?

166
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,125
We warned the ships.

167
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,333
They refused to surrender.

168
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,125
We have control over every town in Norway.

169
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,375
You don't stand a chance.

170
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,541
I thought that you...

171
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,500
had accepted an agreement.
Or did I misunderstand?

172
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,041
I got it.

173
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
I can't believe it.

174
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,625
Pull back!

175
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,375
Colonel, this is in violation of...

176
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,833
I can't have the town blown

177
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,041
to pieces.

178
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,541
Are we not going to fight?

179
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,625
Are we letting them just take it?

180
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,958
Where we going now?

181
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,416
Okay. Let's take a left here, boys.

182
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,375
Are we not going back to camp?

183
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,625
Not a cat in hell's chance.

184
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,250
Are we not?

185
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,375
What's going on?

186
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,666
I'm going home.

187
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,250
Where are you going?

188
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
You know what the Germans to do POWs?

189
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,708
They shoot them.

190
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Magne!

191
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,125
What are you doing?

192
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,125
You're a soldier, damn it.

193
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,833
That one, too! Put him with the others!

194
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,166
That one, too! Put him with the others!

195
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,625
Down!

196
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,375
To the reception desk!

197
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,583
Keep moving!

198
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,666
- Get out!
- Come on, hurry!

199
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,875
This way.

200
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,458
Get down, down!

201
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,541
- Give me the Englishman's keys!
- Come on, hurry up!

202
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,708
- Down, down! To the reception desk.
- One moment.

203
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,291
One second! I need this young lady.

204
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,375
As a translator.

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,333
Mrs. Tofte, could you help us?

206
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,041
ROYAL HOTEL

207
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,375
We urgently need the key to room 503.

208
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,625
They want Ross' key.

209
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,375
We don't give out guests' keys.

210
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,767
I'm sorry,
there is only one key for each room.

211
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,208
Yes. And one that fits everywhere.
The master key.

212
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,083
- The key! Now!
- No.

213
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,958
No, no. We come here as friends.

214
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,541
To protect Norway from the English.
So please be careful with your weapon.

215
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,166
I understand.

216
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,708
You do? Good.

217
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,125
But my husband is a soldier.

218
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,625
Down at the harbor?

219
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:36,958
No.

220
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,375
The Norwegian Army
has laid down their arms.

221
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,958
That means he's safe.

222
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Thank you.

223
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,291
Walter, You're coming with me.

224
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,500
Alright, we'd like
to take over all the rooms.

225
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,916
He wants all the rooms.

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,458
What about the guests?

227
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,750
The guests who need to move out
will be compensated, of course.

228
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,041
One...

229
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,958
Two...

230
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,250
That should be enough for now.

231
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,583
And you will get a pay raise.

232
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,750
No. No, thanks.

233
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,541
- That's not necessary.
- Of course it is.

234
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,083
I need someone who

235
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,486
appreciates the value of cooperation
and who speaks German.

236
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,291
Excuse me.

237
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,625
Go help Bjorg in the kitchen,
people need breakfast.

238
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,208
Did I do something wrong?

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,208
No, you didn't. They were taking
the keys no matter what,

240
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,083
and we cannot control this conflict.

241
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,416
We have a hotel to run.

242
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,666
Halt! Stop there!

243
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,333
Keep marching.

244
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,458
What is going on, soldier?

245
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,666
You're not allowed to leave town.

246
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,708
Why?

247
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,458
You have to turn around
and go back to the barracks.

248
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
You are not allowed to march here.

249
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,625
Yes.

250
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
We march.

251
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,333
Let them through?

252
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,250
I'm ready. Should I shoot?

253
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,125
Eyes forward.

254
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,041
What should we do?

255
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,833
The Germans are out back.

256
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,541
Open the door at once!

257
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,750
Open up!

258
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,541
Hello?

259
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,333
Open the door right now!

260
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,625
We know you're in there!

261
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,333
There you go. Did you not hear us?

262
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,416
Move.

263
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
- Good morning.
- Morning.

264
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,833
Please follow me.

265
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,041
The coffee is ready.

266
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,500
Milk or sugar?

267
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,833
Milk, please.

268
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,000
For me too.

269
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
- Soldiers!
- Come.

270
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,750
Everyone gather...

271
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,166
I didn't know what to say.

272
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,583
What about the hunting cabin?

273
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,083
In the mountains?

274
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,166
We have to leave town.

275
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,666
Should I bring my boots?

276
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,500
Bring your boots.

277
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,125
Have you heard what happened?

278
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,208
What about Gunnar?

279
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,750
He's left already.

280
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,833
No.

281
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,333
The Norwegian soldiers
are here, in Narvik.

282
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,708
They've surrendered.

283
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,333
There's a company
on its way along the tracks.

284
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,333
And Gunnar is among them?

285
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,291
You think Gunnar would surrender?

286
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,471
You didn't make it back to camp yesterday?

287
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,500
He was too busy driving the toy train.

288
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,541
The ferry is closed. Go back home.

289
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,291
We're just standing here
gawking like idiots.

290
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,541
Do you think he's Norwegian?

291
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,458
Grandpa told me that they're from

292
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,291
the Norwegian ships sunk by the Germans.

293
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,333
What's happening?

294
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,250
The ferry is closed for civilians.

295
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,773
No one is allowed to leave the town.

296
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,791
If the Germans think
they can close off the city,

297
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,791
they'll get a surprise.

298
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,583
Ole.

299
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,416
Come.

300
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,041
Don't look.

301
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,208
Did you get more?

302
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,708
Corporal Tofte.

303
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,458
The major wants to see you.

304
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,208
Straight to jail.

305
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,666
It must be written somewhere.

306
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,916
Yes, it must.

307
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,333
We might be missing a page.

308
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,791
Corporal Tofte reporting.

309
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,125
Yes.

310
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,208
I understand you've worked
on the Ofoten line?

311
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,333
Yes, I have.

312
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,416
- When I don't have neutrality duty, sir.
- We are no longer neutral.

313
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:05,708
According to this plan, there
should be some dynamite here. Where is it?

314
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,916
I don't know, sir.

315
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,291
This bridge was made
to be able to be blown up,

316
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,166
so there must be dynamite here.

317
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,791
Tofte! Telephone for you.

318
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,333
Tofte.

319
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,375
Dad?

320
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,291
Can we speak freely?

321
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,083
I can speak freely.

322
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:46,958
Where are you, Gunnar?

323
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,791
Do you know of any dynamite
stored here by the Nordal Bridge?

324
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,833
There's a stash

325
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,625
in the tunnel facing Sweden.

326
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,333
In the tunnel on this side?

327
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,416
Yes. The chamber is in the third pillar.

328
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,333
You'll need...

329
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,416
three, four sticks in each chamber.

330
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,750
I know, Dad.

331
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,833
Gunnar, listen.

332
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,833
There's a train coming up the tracks.

333
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,500
And Ole and Ingrid are on it...

334
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,458
So you are competent with explosives?

335
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,916
Yes, major.

336
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,333
Bring your team, plant the dynamite,
and detonate immediately.

337
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,458
Shouldn't we let the train pass first?

338
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,375
Do you understand
why we're blowing up this bridge?

339
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,958
To keep the iron ore
from reaching Narvik, sir.

340
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,666
The only reason the Germans are here,

341
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,333
is so they can use that ore
for their armored steel.

342
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,208
- I understand.
- Yes.

343
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,125
Then you know we can't risk the train
having German alpine troops onboard.

344
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,125
EXPLOSIVES - DANGER

345
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,541
Right.

346
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,916
Is this enough?

347
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,708
That's all there was, major.

348
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,208
Movement in the tunnel!

349
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,583
Positions! Blast it right away.

350
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:12,041
To cover. Cover.

351
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,708
The chamber
is at the bottom of the third pillar!

352
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,833
Fire on my command!

353
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,291
They're civilians.

354
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,375
Yes.

355
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,083
They're civilians.

356
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,791
Don't shoot!

357
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,416
Daddy!

358
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,041
Stay there, Grethe!

359
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,333
Get the civilians over the bridge.
Over here. Quick!

360
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,916
Get off the bridge! Come on!

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,041
Quick!

362
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,166
- Ole!
- Daddy!

363
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
Get off the bridge. It's gonna blow.

364
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,333
What happened to the train?

365
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,000
The Germans stopped it,

366
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,500
in Hundalen.

367
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,875
Where are they now?

368
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,625
I don't know.

369
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,750
They stayed at the station when we left.

370
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,875
In the tunnel.

371
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,000
Get in the tunnel.

372
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,083
Just follow the tracks.

373
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,958
You're almost in Sweden after that tunnel.

374
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,208
What happens to you?

375
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,500
Corporal! We've got to blast it.

376
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,125
- Yes, major.
- Now!

377
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,000
Run, Ole!

378
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,916
We're right behind.

379
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,333
- Are you?
- Yes!

380
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,875
Fire on my command!

381
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,750
I told you to use the chambers.

382
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,833
Those?

383
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,541
There's no point.

384
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,333
Then we don't have enough dynamite.

385
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,875
What else can we do?

386
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,875
We need a charge up there.

387
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,625
- Attach the rest to the other side.
- Yes.

388
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,166
Come.

389
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,416
I don't want to, I want to wait for daddy.

390
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,916
You heard what daddy said,
he's right behind us.

391
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,875
Ole!

392
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,208
Ole!

393
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,791
- Ole!
- Yes.

394
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,291
Corporal, hurry up!

395
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,125
Shoot!

396
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,166
Don't think. Aim.

397
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,458
Blow it now!

398
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,875
Magne, catch!

399
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,625
Bring those two.

400
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,416
Run!

401
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,291
Gunnar, get off the bridge!

402
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,208
The fuse is lit!

403
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,750
Pull back!

404
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,583
Go, go! Across the bridge!

405
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,833
Go! Move it! Get over the bridge!

406
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,541
After them!

407
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:35,916
After them!

408
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,041
Is daddy coming now?

409
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,416
Are you alone?

410
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,458
Yes, we're alone.

411
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,875
Come with us.

412
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,958
You miserable saboteurs.
You'll regret this.

413
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,000
Move along!

414
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,166
Damn Norwegian pig.

415
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,041
What's happening to them?

416
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,333
They're prisoners of war.

417
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:55,166
They'll get their punishment.

418
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,875
They blew up the bridge.

419
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,750
Stop gawking.

420
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,250
What are you gawking at? Eyes forward.

421
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,416
Keep going, please.

422
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,541
- Grandpa!
- Ole!

423
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,416
Seeing you has made Grandpa happy.

424
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,375
What happened?

425
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:51,208
Daddy blew up the bridge
so it's all crooked.

426
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,666
Did the bridge get all crooked and weird?

427
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,958
Stay right here. Understood?

428
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,833
Is daddy okay?

429
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,750
- Yes.
- Mrs. Tofte?

430
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,000
Consul Wussow wants to see you.

431
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:05,208
Yes.

432
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,458
Mrs. Tofte. Thank you for coming.

433
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,916
We're having trouble with the mayor.

434
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,708
We need to evacuate.

435
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,208
- Evacuate?
- Yes.

436
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,500
We are here to protect you.

437
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:35,666
Oh, to protect us?
But many Norwegians are dead!

438
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,666
Your men had the opportunity

439
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,916
to surrender, and they chose not to.

440
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,291
What... Ingrid, he might understand
what I'm saying, but not what I mean.

441
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,666
- We need to evacuate.
- Yes.

442
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,416
Mr. Mayor, let's start from the top again.

443
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,416
You tried to send a telegraph?

444
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,166
What did you want to achieve by it?

445
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,291
You tried to telegraph, and...

446
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,208
they want to know

447
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,166
- what you want to achieve.
- Yes.

448
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,458
I've already told you,

449
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,083
I wanted to warn the British.

450
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,750
He wanted to warn the British.

451
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,166
Warn them.

452
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,083
- About what?
- About what?

453
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,833
The town is full of civilians.

454
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,583
That the town is full of civilians.

455
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,750
Yes.

456
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,541
Which Englishman did he talk to?

457
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,791
He asks who you were in contact with.

458
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,666
No one, I didn't get that far.

459
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,625
None.

460
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,666
Yes. If you refuse to let us evacuate,

461
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,500
we'll be forced to use
the pedestrian tunnel as a shelter.

462
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,125
We have a long tunnel that the mayor

463
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,541
wants to use as an air-raid shelter.

464
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,041
The English aren't coming.

465
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,208
Ok. Then why do we need your protection?

466
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,166
Then why do you want to protect us?

467
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,458
The English won't come
because we are here.

468
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,142
The English won't come
as long as the Germans are here.

469
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,416
For the good of your people,
we should cooperate.

470
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,166
Oh, cooperate?

471
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,250
Our neutrality has been violated!

472
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,500
I'm not done with you yet.

473
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,750
No. You can tell him
I have another errand.

474
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,333
We need the mayor
to keep the town running.

475
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,958
May I try again?

476
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,958
One more thing.

477
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,791
He's temperamental,
but can be reasoned with.

478
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,041
Get the man under control.

479
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,541
We need 50 skilled workers.

480
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,583
See to it.

481
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,791
Go home and try to get some rest.

482
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,583
Yes.

483
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,750
Everything okay?

484
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,875
My husband was captured
on the Nordal Bridge.

485
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,416
Yes.

486
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,708
I... I fear for his life.

487
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,666
You have the wrong idea about us,
Mrs. Tofte.

488
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,916
We aren't like that.

489
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,833
But...

490
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:55,125
he was one of those

491
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,916
who blew up the bridge

492
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,125
I see.

493
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,000
I will ask General Dietl about it.

494
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,041
Thank you.

495
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,458
Would you do that?

496
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,625
Of course.

497
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,625
I will emphasize
how important your work is to us.

498
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,541
His name is

499
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,666
Gunnar Tofte.

500
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,791
Okay.

501
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,000
Thank you.

502
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,083
That's it.

503
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's Bjorg.

504
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,083
- Oh!
- It's moving!

505
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,625
Go on in.

506
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,166
Wait.

507
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,250
Sorry to intrude.

508
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,000
It's our friends from room 503.

509
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,833
They've asked you to visit.

510
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,416
- What do they want?
- For you to bring this.

511
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,625
Why can't you do it?

512
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,791
They insisted on you,

513
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,250
and that it had to be today.

514
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,583
No, they'll be fine without tobacco.

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,333
If you don't help, it becomes my problem.

516
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,538
You're the one who told me
to walk them to the cabin.

517
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,333
You can't just dump everything on me.

518
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,291
Good morning, General Dietl.
Your car is ready.

519
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,809
Drive me down to the pier,
I'm meeting with Admiral Bontar.

520
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,125
Yes, sir.

521
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,708
The attaché is here already.

522
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,625
General.

523
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,625
Put it over here.

524
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,517
But when it has been restored
and the trains are running again,

525
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,250
we're faced with the next problem:

526
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,958
the harbor, mines and line
need to be operational.

527
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,666
There are volunteers.

528
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,833
See to it,

529
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,125
use all your channels.

530
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,666
People must know that
everything will keep going like before.

531
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,541
Everything will keep going as usual.
People should go to work.

532
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,416
Nothing has changed,
everything goes on as normal.

533
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:12,875
Thank you.

534
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,333
English war ships are in the fjord!

535
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,208
They're attacking, General.

536
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,375
I thought the German fleet
had everything under control?

537
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,333
Why weren't we warned?

538
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,166
Aslak! Basement!

539
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,166
Are the English bad too?

540
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,375
No.

541
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,416
They've come to help us.

542
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:05,750
- Come on, Dag!
- Down to the basement.

543
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:12,208
All men to the dock!

544
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,583
All together! Now go!

545
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:25,875
All together!

546
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,750
Come on!

547
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,291
Faster!

548
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,000
Ole, come here.

549
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:27,375
There.

550
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,333
I have to pee.

551
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,666
Pee?

552
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,291
I don't want to pee.

553
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,958
It's perfectly normal to pee.

554
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02,458
If you get really scared, you have
to hurry or you'll pee your pants.

555
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,750
Are the Germans peeing their pants now?

556
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:05,833
I'm sure they are.

557
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,500
Hitler too.

558
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,250
<i>Hitler he cheated</i>

559
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,708
<i>He peed in his pants</i>

560
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,000
If I know Polly,

561
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,583
she's readied the rooms
for the English already.

562
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,500
Is Daddy coming too?

563
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,833
Yes, but maybe not right away.

564
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:13,958
Oh, okay.

565
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,875
Is it the English?

566
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:25,358
No, they haven't come ashore yet,
and I don't understand why.

567
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,000
They've sunk all the German ships.

568
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,250
Ingrid, we need help out here.

569
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,416
Okay.

570
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,625
Stop helping the Germans.

571
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,666
This is my job, Aslak.

572
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,375
It's best if you go home
and wait for the English.

573
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,541
You go ahead, I'll come later.

574
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,916
Yes, like that.

575
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,708
He's got severe burns,
so clean the wounds please,

576
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,625
apply some ointment and bandages.

577
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,416
- Yes. We must clean it and apply bandages.
- Okay.

578
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,375
And it's the same for him.

579
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,750
Could your colleague take care of it?

580
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,541
It's mainly up here.

581
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,875
I've got cars to take them
to the military hospital.

582
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,000
Good. We'll take
the most seriously injured first.

583
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,208
Okay.

584
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,166
I need all their names.

585
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:25,708
Mrs. Tofte, could the rest of them
spend the night here?

586
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,208
Have you spoken to General Dietl?

587
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,791
No. I'm afraid he's not here.

588
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,541
When will he be back?

589
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,666
You need to be careful.

590
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,583
The general is under a lot of pressure.

591
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:38,708
What does that mean?

592
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,833
It's the wrong time

593
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,833
to tell him that your husband was there

594
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,333
when they blew up the bridge.

595
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,666
I understand.

596
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,958
Polly!

597
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,125
I'll get more blankets.

598
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,041
Stop complaining.

599
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,291
Halt!

600
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,166
You know there's a curfew?

601
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,208
- I... I have to get home.
- May I see your papers?

602
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,375
Yes.

603
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,958
Uh, one moment.

604
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,208
There.

605
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,791
Everything's in order. Go on.

606
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:01,875
Thank you.

607
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,541
Direct hit!

608
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,125
Everyone out of the building!

609
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,375
Put out the fire!

610
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:35,791
Pray for your lives!

611
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:59,666
Ole!

612
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,958
Ole!

613
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,166
No!

614
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,708
Aslak!

615
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,250
Ole!

616
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,541
- Ole!
- Yes...

617
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,375
Mommy.

618
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:42,458
I'm bleeding.

619
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,208
Hey.

620
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:56,458
ROASME, 4 WEEKS LATER

621
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:08,833
THE GERMANS HAVE ESTABLISHED
AN IRON RING AROUND NARVIK

622
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:16,750
FRENCH AND POLISH TROOPS HAVE DISEMBARKED
TO ATTACK FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH

623
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:25,291
FIRST THE NORWEGIANS MUST NEUTRALIZE
THE GERMAN POSITIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS.

624
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,791
Don't fall behind!

625
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,250
Get him back up, damn it!

626
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,125
We have to keep going!

627
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,208
Get up.

628
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,625
Get him up!

629
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,250
Pathetic Norwegians.

630
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,458
Come on.

631
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,750
If you can't get him up...

632
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,166
Think about that girl you love.

633
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,583
...I'll shoot him.

634
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,625
At the hotel.

635
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,875
- Bjorg has forgotten about me.
- Don't be silly.

636
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,158
- She remembers you.
- Magne, Bjorg is in love with you.

637
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,250
Ingrid told me.

638
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:49,958
Come on!

639
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:51,833
Move!

640
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,916
What else did she say?

641
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,875
Bjørg talks about you,

642
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,041
every day.

643
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,583
She's waiting for you.

644
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,208
For you to come home.

645
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,125
Shut up.

646
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:10,833
- Thank you.
- He already had some.

647
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:16,625
It gets worse if you stare.

648
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,166
What's going to happen to us?

649
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:31,791
Move it!

650
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:33,666
BOFORS MORTARS

651
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,833
Look what we are carrying.

652
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,041
Bofors ammunition.

653
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,458
How many dead Norwegians
in this box, you think?

654
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,083
Grenades!

655
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:04,166
Get ready to leave!

656
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,458
Get the wounded!

657
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,125
The wounded to HQ!

658
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:10,416
Get up, come on.

659
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,750
Faster!

660
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,375
Go! Faster!

661
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,458
Where are we going?

662
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:16,375
To HQ, by the railway line.

663
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,333
Why is this taking so long?

664
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,958
To your position!

665
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,375
Go!

666
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:23,875
There!

667
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,416
Yes, to the side.

668
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,375
Be careful.

669
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,458
How careful do you think
the Germans are with us?

670
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,458
How did that

671
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,708
story go again?

672
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,750
That guy who got his head smashed in
while the grandkid watched.

673
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,541
The one from Narvik?

674
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,208
- Tollefsen.
- No, Tofte.

675
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:48,666
How careful do you think
the Germans were with his head?

676
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,041
Tofte, you said?

677
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:54,666
Gunnar.

678
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,833
Go!

679
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:07,666
Go, go! To our positions!

680
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,250
Get the injured out, quickly!

681
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,250
Get out! Go!

682
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:16,875
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

683
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,583
Go, faster!

684
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,875
Get in here.

685
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,416
What happened to the kid?

686
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,916
- Tofte. Is the grandkid alive?
- I don't know.

687
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,458
Get up!

688
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,500
Stop!

689
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:39,708
Gunnar!

690
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:43,666
Stop right there!

691
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,000
It's okay, come on.

692
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,250
Come on, guys. Let's go.

693
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,666
Gunnar, we have to leave.

694
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,000
Let's run.

695
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:09,583
Look out!

696
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:17,291
Come on, Goddamn it. Come on...

697
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,791
Shit.

698
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,375
Here.

699
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,625
Let's go.

700
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,351
- Look out!
- they're coming from the left

701
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,750
Machine gun!

702
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,583
To the left.

703
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:12,791
To the right.

704
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,541
It's Pierre!

705
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,291
It's okay, guys.

706
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,125
- Who's he?
- It's okay.

707
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,250
He's with us.

708
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,041
Ah, thank you.

709
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,000
Well done. Pierre.

710
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,750
- Gunnar.
- You're welcome.

711
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,416
Come, let's go. We have to go.

712
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,250
Why the hell are you here?

713
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,708
Norwegian?

714
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,166
Are you injured?

715
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,541
No.

716
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,750
- Bring it down right away.
- Yes.

717
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,916
The Germans have fled the mountain.

718
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,541
Major.

719
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:21,833
Something to report?

720
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,875
Two dead Germans at the machine gun post.

721
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,541
Both shot by Corporal Tofte.

722
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Yes.

723
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,333
The guy who told you that story,
is he here?

724
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,583
No.

725
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,153
I didn't know it was your father,

726
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:37,458
my condolences.

727
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,375
Corporal?

728
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,208
This was very well done.

729
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,833
- I must get to Narvik.
- Yes.

730
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:48,208
You'll be there soon fighting like that.

731
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,083
How long?

732
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,166
When we've emptied
the mountains of Germans.

733
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,791
Might be fast now that we have
the French helping,

734
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,583
and even the Poles from the south.

735
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,250
I need to go home now.

736
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:06,000
Yes. Then we must fight.

737
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:08,875
Corporal.

738
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,625
Did you have a little kid as well?

739
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,750
I don't know if he's alive.

740
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,541
You need to believe.

741
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,000
Believe that we'll soon
be standing in Narvik.

742
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,916
Then you can look your kid in the eye

743
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,958
and know he'll be growing up
in a free fatherland.

744
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,125
Come on.

745
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,208
Here you go, up.

746
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,625
This is what we're fighting for.

747
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,875
We're Norwegians,

748
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:42,208
and we fight for each other.

749
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,208
- Yes!
- Yes!

750
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:56,041
NARVIK, 1 WEEK LATER

751
01:04:57,125 --> 01:05:03,958
CIVILIANS ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN THE GERMAN AND BRITISH SHIPS

752
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:18,791
Does it hurt?

753
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,625
Yes.

754
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,458
Hold it.

755
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,833
Hey. We talked about this.

756
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,625
There.

757
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,041
Ingrid, I have to talk to you.

758
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,875
- What is it?
- It's the Germans.

759
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,291
They're going door to door,

760
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:50,166
asking who's hiding the English.

761
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,500
Have you told anyone?

762
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,791
No,

763
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,125
but now they're asking for you.

764
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:58,125
- As an interpreter.
- I don't know.

765
01:05:58,708 --> 01:05:59,750
You have to go.

766
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,458
I'll watch Ole.

767
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:32,500
My superiors
want to ration the food further.

768
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,666
They want to cut the rations.

769
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,333
No.

770
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,875
People are starving. I can't do it.

771
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,375
The people are starving.

772
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,125
- We need food.
- I know.

773
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,750
It's only until
they find the British consul.

774
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,916
Those who are helping the English now

775
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,250
are putting everyone else in danger.
Do you understand?

776
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:52,053
They... He says it's only until
they find the consul and it's just...

777
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,625
I don't know where the consul is.

778
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,642
Consul Wussow, I must ask you
to follow me to the basement.

779
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:56,666
Yes.

780
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,833
They say go to the basement.

781
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:01,166
I don't want to go to the basement
with these Germans.

782
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,333
They have lost their homes
and their families.

783
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,666
Your people suffer the most
under the British air raids.

784
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,958
He says it's us,

785
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,750
the people of Narvik, who suffer
the most from the British shelling.

786
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,041
- Where is Consul Ross?
- I don't know.

787
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,875
If had I known,
I probably wouldn't have told them.

788
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:24,958
I can give you one more day,

789
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,250
then you must tell us who it is that's
providing the English with intelligence.

790
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:30,101
Otherwise you will be charged
with high treason.

791
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:32,875
They'll charge you with treason
if they don't show up tomorrow.

792
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,708
It's dangerous outside.
You should stay the night here

793
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,041
at the hotel.

794
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,458
I have to go to my son.

795
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,791
For his sake,
you should think of your own safety.

796
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:47,458
ROYAL HOTEL

797
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,666
He has nightmares because of the bombs.

798
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,833
I see.

799
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,750
I only have nightmares during the day.

800
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,666
And the days keep getting longer.

801
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,791
A few more weeks,
and there will be no more nights.

802
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,208
How did it go?

803
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,083
Hi, honey.

804
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,625
When did you last speak to the English?

805
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,333
Yesterday.

806
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,017
Are they gonna obliterate the entire town
before they come ashore?

807
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,250
They'll come soon.

808
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,083
Soon?

809
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,458
Yes.

810
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,541
Mommy?

811
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:44,916
I'm bleeding.

812
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,541
I've looked. He's not bleeding.

813
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:47,750
I know.

814
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,333
It's his nightmares.

815
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,416
Ole!

816
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,833
Ole!

817
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:02,916
No!

818
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:04,333
Ole!

819
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,750
Ole!

820
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,333
I'm sorry, Consul.

821
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,208
She insisted.

822
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,791
Get the doctor.

823
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,000
Mrs. Tofte.

824
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,083
- Right away, please.
- What happened?

825
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,500
His wound is badly infected.

826
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:03,375
We have countless
seriously injured soldiers.

827
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,583
And the doctor is under orders
to take care of them first.

828
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,041
I am sorry.

829
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,250
But I work for you.

830
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,583
I know.

831
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,083
He is all I have. Please!

832
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,708
But you don't understand. I can't

833
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,226
go over the heads of the commanders.

834
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,833
It is a military issue.

835
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,958
I know where the consul is.

836
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,333
Pardon?

837
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,291
I know where the Englishmen are.

838
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:12,250
Ingrid?

839
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,250
- Is Ingrid here?
- Please wait in the lobby.

840
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:22,541
But it's really important.

841
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:23,916
Ingrid?

842
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,208
What's going on?

843
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,166
Is he sick?

844
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,083
He'll be okay.

845
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,041
Can I talk to you?

846
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:37,125
- Not now.
- That's enough.

847
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:38,708
I can't wait.

848
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,208
They've been caught.

849
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:45,750
How do you know?

850
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,351
There were German soldiers at the cabin.

851
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,708
Did they see you?

852
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,625
You have to do it carefully.

853
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,083
Make sure he's completely still.

854
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,791
How were you able to get a doctor here?

855
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:06,791
Bjorg, look at me.

856
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,250
I didn't say you helped hide them.

857
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,583
Look. Two millimeters to the right,
and it would have hit his lung.

858
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:26,916
Small blessings.

859
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:46,250
ROMBAKEN FJORD, 2 WEEKS LATER

860
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:54,250
NORWEGIAN AND FRENCH SOLDIERS HAVE WAITED
FOR THE GO-AHEAD FOR THE BATTLE OF NARVIK

861
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:14,000
Grenade!

862
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,875
How are the blasting caps?

863
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,000
They'll work, sir.

864
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,083
Yes?

865
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:33,541
Here.

866
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,500
As soon as they've fired,

867
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,750
they move the cannon back into
the tunnel so it's completely hidden.

868
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,041
Do you see the five machine gun positions?

869
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:57,833
Yes.

870
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:00,891
Once the French have taken it out,
you'll get a signal from there,

871
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:04,791
then go full speed into the tunnel
and take out the cannons.

872
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:13,833
This is the last hill before Narvik.

873
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:15,041
Remember that!

874
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:47,958
Come on!

875
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,833
I don't see any signal.

876
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,125
Keep going.

877
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,041
Hansen!

878
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,541
Gunnar?

879
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:08,958
Am I dying?

880
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,375
It's not your blood.

881
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,250
Run!

882
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,166
Do you want to die?

883
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:41,666
Halt!

884
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,291
Halt!

885
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,791
Goddamn cowards!

886
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:57,916
If anyone takes another step,

887
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'll shoot them!

888
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,750
Get back up!

889
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:06,125
Major, MS Cairo has been hit.

890
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,791
We have to take out that cannon!

891
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,250
Come on.

892
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,333
Come on!

893
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,750
Come on, guys! Let's follow him.

894
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:19,833
Let's go, follow him!

895
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,125
It's no use!

896
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,875
We can't give up here, Gunnar.

897
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:27,041
We have to get up.

898
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,208
There's another way.

899
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,083
Another way?

900
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,458
We can't do it alone.

901
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,166
French?

902
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,208
Come on, Praestnes!

903
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,250
Yes.

904
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:01,166
Everything alright?

905
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,708
Everything under control?

906
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,791
Say something!

907
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,041
Shoot!

908
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,125
Shoot them dead!

909
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:52,625
Don't shoot!

910
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,208
Hi. Don't shoot!

911
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,166
Major!

912
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,396
Major! The cannon has been taken out!

913
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,250
Roger.

914
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,291
Forward!

915
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,416
Here, you got that?

916
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,625
- What about this one?
- Burn it.

917
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:21,958
Here's more.

918
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,875
Go in and get the one from the stairs.

919
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,958
- You asked for me?
- Yes.

920
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,791
Wussow here

921
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:31,958
insisted on talking with you
before he leaves.

922
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:36,208
So you're doing better?

923
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:38,875
That's nice to see.

924
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,333
Thank you.

925
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,333
I should thank you.

926
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,625
You were a great help to me and

927
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:47,708
to Narvik.

928
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,000
ROYAL HOTEL

929
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,458
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

930
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,000
Sadly.

931
01:22:57,416 --> 01:23:00,791
Would you consider
accompanying me to Berlin?

932
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,750
Ole, can you talk to Polly?

933
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,208
I'll be there soon.

934
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,791
Ole, come with me.

935
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:14,875
There...

936
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:15,958
Why?

937
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,333
Do you like chocolates?

938
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:21,583
I am not one of you.

939
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,875
But you'll all soon be a part of us.

940
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:28,375
The world is changing right now.

941
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:30,000
And very quickly.

942
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,375
Hitler is victorious everywhere.

943
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,041
But not here.

944
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:40,583
There will be brutal
German air raids on Narvik.

945
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,833
I don't want you to be here all alone
when this happens.

946
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,583
Alone?

947
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:48,958
I'm not alone.

948
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,208
Mrs. Tofte.

949
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,875
Your husband's name
is Gunnar Tofte, correct?

950
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:06,875
Yes.

951
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,166
His name has been removed from our lists.

952
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,958
Removed?

953
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:16,875
What does that mean?

954
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:19,500
I'm afraid that's bad news.

955
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:21,875
I am sorry.

956
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,750
May I see the list?

957
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:40,416
MOUNTAIN DIVISION, NORWEGIAN

958
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,000
I just didn't know how to tell you.

959
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,708
Your son was so ill at the time.

960
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:22,125
- What are you doing?
- Folding.

961
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:24,916
You're so good.

962
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,416
Did you know?

963
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:35,916
What?

964
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:43,333
About Gunnar?

965
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:47,500
Did you know?

966
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,000
I can't do this.

967
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:58,833
Ingrid, you have to be strong.

968
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,250
For Ole's sake.

969
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:04,458
You have to get out of town.

970
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:08,458
You can't stay here, people are talking.

971
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,666
Who?

972
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,333
You know how people are.

973
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:15,875
They need someone to be angry at.

974
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:24,208
Especially with the Germans leaving.

975
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,875
Here's your pay, Ingrid.

976
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,291
Don't you have family further north?

977
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,666
You should go there, far away from Narvik.

978
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:36,041
This is your money, take Ole and go.

979
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:40,541
You can do it. You have Ole.

980
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,625
Ole, come.

981
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:01,083
What about you?

982
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:04,291
How will people look at you?

983
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,500
I only have myself to worry about.

984
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,708
I don't have a little...

985
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,333
prince like you do.

986
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,208
I'll be fine.

987
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:28,083
Hip hip!

988
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:43,416
<i>It's a long way to southern Norway</i>

989
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,416
<i>It's a long way</i>

990
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,291
<i>- To go
- To go</i>

991
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:50,791
<i>We shall win, we shall prevail</i>

992
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:54,541
<i>When we all together go</i>

993
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:58,166
<i>The weapons, hear them calling</i>

994
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:01,833
<i>We will chase the Germans home</i>

995
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:05,666
<i>It's a far, far way to southern Norway</i>

996
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,541
<i>But we'll leave right away</i>

997
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:09,708
And the French!

998
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:13,083
<i>It's a long way to southern Norway</i>

999
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:16,125
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

1000
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,750
The town is yours now.

1001
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,416
Cheers!

1002
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,000
Is that his wife?

1003
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,375
She's beautiful.

1004
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,666
Congratulations!

1005
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:52,208
Go back home.

1006
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,166
Your city is yours now.

1007
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:05,958
Here they come!

1008
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,833
Here they come!

1009
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:11,583
Our boys are coming!

1010
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,333
NARVIK, 28 MAY 1940

1011
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:22,958
Hooray!

1012
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:24,500
Hooray!

1013
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:47,000
Hooray!

1014
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,625
Welcome home!

1015
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:00,375
Isn't Ingrid here?

1016
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:01,625
I don't know.

1017
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:06,875
It's probably not easy for her,
as much as she's dealt with the Germans.

1018
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,250
What do you mean?

1019
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,208
Ole?

1020
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:30,833
Look what I found.

1021
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,875
They said you were dead.

1022
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:54,958
Who did?

1023
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:15,833
Hi, Ole.

1024
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,000
Aren't you going to say, "Hi" to daddy?

1025
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,500
Hi. Hi, you.

1026
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:25,875
Hi.

1027
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,458
Nice flag.

1028
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:28,583
Thank you.

1029
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,166
Should we celebrate outside?

1030
01:32:31,416 --> 01:32:32,833
I'm not allowed.

1031
01:32:33,708 --> 01:32:35,250
Of course you are!

1032
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:38,708
Why not?

1033
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:41,416
Polly said we have to leave town.

1034
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,333
Yeah, we have to leave.

1035
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,291
I ran into Bjorg.

1036
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,291
Do you know what she's talking about?

1037
01:32:57,625 --> 01:33:00,166
I can... I can explain, but not now.

1038
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,666
- Why not?
- Please, Gunnar.

1039
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,916
Should we bring the train?

1040
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,320
What did you do with the Germans?

1041
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,750
I did what I had to.

1042
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:14,041
What?

1043
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,333
He was dying.

1044
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:21,125
Can you show daddy your scar?

1045
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:26,291
- No. Ole, you don't have to show anything.
- See.

1046
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:28,125
Have you been with a German?

1047
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:33,625
No.

1048
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:38,291
Then why are you running away? Answer!

1049
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,916
Because I informed on some Englishmen.

1050
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,708
That's not true.

1051
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,250
It is.

1052
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,166
They're on our side.

1053
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,875
They weren't on my side.

1054
01:33:56,958 --> 01:33:59,541
I wouldn't be standing here
if it were not for them.

1055
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,958
Then look where you are standing!

1056
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:05,708
Ole almost died from an English shell,

1057
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:08,958
and that same goddamn shell
killed your dad...

1058
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,833
That must have been an accident.

1059
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,375
That's not a reason to switch sides.

1060
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:15,333
You don't understand.

1061
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,896
What, Ingrid? That you're a traitor!?

1062
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,208
Who have I betrayed?

1063
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,291
Us!

1064
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:21,916
Us who defended you.

1065
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,916
Who was defending Ole?

1066
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,958
While you were out waging war?

1067
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,458
Should I have let him die?

1068
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,125
Ingrid, this is war.

1069
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:35,875
People die!

1070
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,625
It would have been better

1071
01:34:42,666 --> 01:34:44,958
if you never came back!

1072
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:49,000
Ole, are you ready?

1073
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:50,916
Come.

1074
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:25,500
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding!

1075
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,458
No, you're not bleeding.

1076
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,416
Hey.

1077
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,916
Hey.

1078
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,250
You have to listen.

1079
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:48,041
Now you see how the Germans
thank you for helping.

1080
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:04,666
Praestnes, get down!

1081
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,750
Gunnar?

1082
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:26,708
Listen.

1083
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:28,583
It's too late.

1084
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:30,916
He's dead.

1085
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,250
Gone.

1086
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,333
Why didn't we return fire?

1087
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:50,750
The English are defending the airspace.

1088
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:52,433
There are no English ships in the fjord.

1089
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,625
If the English have left,
it's to defend their homeland.

1090
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:06,041
Is it true that Hitler has taken France?

1091
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:11,333
Fight for everything you hold dear,

1092
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,625
and die if you must.

1093
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:24,666
Private Praestnes did just that.
He died for everything he held dear,

1094
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,166
and that's a sacrifice he made
for all of us standing here.

1095
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:30,208
Because we are Norwegians,
and we fight for each other.

1096
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,541
And now more than ever,

1097
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:35,208
we need those of you who are willing

1098
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,625
to sacrifice themselves.

1099
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:38,583
Who are willing to sacrifice everything

1100
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:39,916
for what they hold dear.

1101
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:09,750
Yes.

1102
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,708
Where is the camp?

1103
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:16,666
Up the road to the right.

1104
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,125
Where can I find a weapon?

1105
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:19,583
The camp's in the woods.

1106
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,833
German planes!

1107
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:24,250
Planes!

1108

Come onboard!

1109
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,666
Don't stand there and drink!

Move away.

1112
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,791
Should throw her into the sea.

1113
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,333
Come on. Hurry.

1114
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:41,041

BUT THE VICTORY WAS BRIEF

1121
01:41:55,750 --> 01:42:01,541
WITHOUT INFORMING NORWAY, GREAT BRITAIN
AND FRANCE ORDERED A FULL WITHDRAWAL

1122
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:19,000
NORWEGIAN FORCES WERE ALONE AND HAD TO
LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS ON JUNE 8TH 1940
