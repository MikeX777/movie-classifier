1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
THIS IS WORK OF FICTION. ANY SIMILARITIES
TO ACTUAL EVENTS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

2
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,880
So cool.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,080
What are you waiting for?

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,160
Alright, goodbye.

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,760
Last week, you're booked by Syafiq.

6
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,120
This week, I am booking you earlier.

7
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
If you win, we split 30/70.

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Only 30%?

9
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
- Only 30%?
- Thirty percent is also money.

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
There is also something for you tonight.

11
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,920
- As if you don't understand.
- How's my ride?

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,720
Front and back tires are TT100.
Single pistering and upgraded carburettor.

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,200
Okay. I think, starting next week,
I am going to train him.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,240
How's that? Deal?

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
It's on!

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,840
- So, it will be 30/70.
- It's a deal.

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,120
Did you win?

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,960
- So noisy.
- Noisy.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
What?

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
You are talking about this bike?
Hey, how much is he giving you?

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,600
Thirty-70.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,320
This bike is not in the best condition.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Are you making fun of me?

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Rather than bet on that bike,
it's better if you bet on mine.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,600
At least, this bike's pick-up
is good in first and second gear.

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,960
Look at the mirror. The front and back
are chromed, for what?

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
For your girlfriend's reflection?

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,640
Hey, mind yourself.

29
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
The mirror?

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll take it off, then.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,440
You are damn noisy.

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
Hold this. Because of this,
we were made fun of.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,720
- Remember, 30/70.
- Get lost!

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
- Don't be arrogant.
- Get lost.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Hey, how long do you
want to ride people's bikes?

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
You can afford this bike.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,120
Just sell your EX5 and you will be able

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,760
to afford the down payment.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Bro, they'll pay me if I win.

40
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,800
When I get my new bike, I'll come
to your house and make some noise.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,920
- Really?
- Really.

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
Okay, let's go!

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,000
We race for 1km, freestyle!

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Come on!

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
Quick! Come on!

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
Come on, let's go!

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Come on!

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
Okay, stand by.

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
We go toward the Jalan Parlimen.

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
Quietly.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,040
- Okay, come in quickly.
- Where?

52
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
- Here?
- Yes.

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,160
Switch on the light.
Okay. Wait here for a while.

54
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,280
You just came back? What time
do you want to check out tomorrow?

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
What do you mean by "check out", Mom?

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,640
Because you treat this house like a hotel.

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,360
What were you doing this late at night?
Don't you know when to sleep?

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,320
I helped my friend at the burger stall.

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm just worried that
something bad will happen to you.

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,840
Don't worry, Mom. It's not like I'm
doing drugs or flirting with girls.

62
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm just helping at the burger stall,
it's not like I'm selling drugs.

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
- You smell!
- What?

64
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,560
Like cigarettes. Go brush your teeth
and don't forget to wash your feet.

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Hey.

66
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
MY MAIN GOAL: MOTOR 125Z

67
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,160
Madi! Why are you so inconsiderate?

68
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,480
Playing music so loud at this hour!

69
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,480
- Peace be upon you, baby.
- Peace be upon you too.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why aren't you asleep yet?

71
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,320
I'm out shopping with my mom.

72
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Baby, tomorrow you're fetching me right?

73
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,520
Yes. Who else will fetch you besides me?

74
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Hmm.

75
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I just wanted to confirm it with you.

76
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Okay, okay.

77
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,360
What are you doing?
Why aren't you asleep yet?

78
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I am sleeping now.

79
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, baby, my mom is here.
Don't forget about tomorrow, okay?

80
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Baby, can I get a kiss?

81
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,360
Okay, thank you.

82
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Goodbye.

83
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,360
OPEN 24 HOUR

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
This is Dataran Merdeka.

85
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,040
There is a lot of history here,
and we're proud of it.

86
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,640
Let's get a good parking spot
and then we shall go.

87
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,520
What is that?

88
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,200
Crazy. What kind of person
rides a bike like that?

89
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Crazy bunch of people.

90
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Really?

91
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,640
Hot topic? What's that?

92
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh my God.

93
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
She went out with a rempit?

94
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,000
Does that mean her daughter is a slut?

95
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,480
Praise to God the Almighty.

96
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,720
- Really?
- Miss Maimon.

97
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,440
- She wore sexy clothes?
- Miss Maimon.

98
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,600
Praise to God the Almighty.

99
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,680
Miss Maimon, this is the invoice
from Initial-D Company. Please sign.

100
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
- Signature only?
- Yes.

101
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,400
Why are you in a hurry?

102
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,920
Seeing your girlfriend?

103
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,920
Thank you, miss.

104
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,160
Just now, I saw your boyfriend over there.

105
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,080
Really?

106
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,960
He didn't call me.

107
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,480
Why don't I know?

108
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,560
How can you possibly know?

109
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
You only know how to gossip.

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,960
Please take care of my belongings.
I'll collect it tomorrow morning.

111
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
Okay, see you.

112
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,840
Why are you late?

113
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,640
You only know how to complain.
Just get on the bike.

114
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,920
Why do you look so tired, baby?

115
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,880
It's because you called me last night,
so I didn't get enough sleep.

116
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
Excuses.

117
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,560
So, where are we going?

118
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
Are we going back straight
or having lunch first?

119
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Where do you want to go?

120
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,680
I want to go eat. I'm hungry.

121
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,440
I feel like eating fruit.

122
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,280
What kind of fruit
do you want to eat now, baby?

123
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
What are you looking at?

124
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
Pervert! Move aside.

125
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
- You want to ride the bike?
- Yes. Let me. Move aside.

126
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,960
You came late, looking tired even.

127
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Go faster. I'm scared.

128
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,720
Hold on tight.

129
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
Move your foot aside.

130
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,880
Hey, what's this? Boyfriend riding behind?

131
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
What a shame.

132
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,000
In that case, you're not rempit.
Might as well become a girl.

133
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
You have no class.

134
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,280
- It's okay, baby, just go. Just go.
- Just ignore them?

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,080
Just go?

136
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,360
What's wrong?

137
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,040
Handsome boy.

138
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,440
- Faster.
- Faster.

139
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,240
Hey, handsome boy.

140
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
- Handsome boy. Faster!
- What's wrong with them?

141
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,480
Baby, let's swap places.

142
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,360
Come on, quickly.

143
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
- Faster.
- Faster.

144
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, baby. Make sure you go home now.

145
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,800
Don't go anywhere else after this.

146
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,240
- Here.
- Oops, thank you.

147
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,880
After this, I'm going to Macha's house.

148
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,800
If you don't believe me,
you can follow me.

149
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,240
You're crazy. I'm going in.

150
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
- What's wrong?
- Where is my fruit?

151
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Pervert!

152
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,960
You're a pervert, baby.

153
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,200
You don't want to come with me
to the shop tomorrow?

154
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,400
I don't want to.

155
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,840
Tomorrow will be the best day ever!

156
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,600
125Z is already out.

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,840
Okay, I'm going now. Remember
to wash your feet before bed.

158
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Alright.

159
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,160
- Goodnight, baby.
- Goodnight.

160
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,960
MOTORCYCLE SHOP

161
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,600
That's the bike that I used the other day.

162
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
The sprocket broke. I'll buy a new one.

163
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Hi. Where's my bike? Can I take it now?

164
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Okay.

165
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,440
- Thank you.
- Okay.

166
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,640
Usually, young people like you

167
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,080
pay the installment first.

168
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,920
But it's good
that you didn't pay the installment.

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Then, I could give you a discount.

170
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,560
You only mention
a discount after I've paid?

171
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,600
You said you wanted to pay cash,

172
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,840
so, I didn't tell you
about the installment.

173
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,640
- Is it this the one?
- Yes, it's this one.

174
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,280
Mad, please get the stuff I talked about.

175
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Alright.

176
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,960
The petrol is low.
Can you give me a full tank instead?

177
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm already giving you
a free raincoat and helmet.

178
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,840
You even want a full tank?

179
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
Hey, if that's the case,
how can I make a profit?

180
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Boss, here's the oil,
raincoat, and helmet.

181
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,760
Your petrol is enough to go fuel up.

182
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,880
If somebody wants to buy my old bike,
can you sell it to an old person?

183
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,480
- I'm scared that the bike will "barai".
- What's "barai"?

184
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,200
- It won't work.
- Oh, so you still care about the bike?

185
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,920
Okay, no problem.

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay. My key?

187
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,080
- Bro, here's your old helmet.
- I thought of giving it to you.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
Hey!

189
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,160
Praise to God the Almighty.

190
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,760
Keep it down! My dad is inside!

191
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
You bastard!

192
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
125Z!

193
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,080
Why didn't you ask me to come with you?

194
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,440
Right. I'll ask you to come with me
even if I go to the toilet.

195
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Bro.

196
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
- Can I use your workshop?
- Sure, but after I pray.

197
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,640
Hey, Cha, even a rocker like you pray?

198
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,600
What do you mean by that?
Just wait till I'm done praying!

199
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Amin.

200
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,520
- Are you done praying?
- Yes, Dad.

201
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
Dad, what are you reading?

202
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Dad.

203
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
Dad, have you eaten?

204
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,280
What nonsense are you talking about?
We just ate together.

205
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,640
What's your problem?

206
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,640
It's nothing, Dad.

207
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Actually, I want to buy a new bike.

208
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
125Z. Like Madi's bike.

209
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,400
- Can I?
- What?

210
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
A new bike? 125Z?

211
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,600
No problem, my son!

212
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
- Really, Dad?
- Yes.

213
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
- Really?
- Yes!

214
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,360
Go to my room, open the cupboard.

215
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,560
Inside the cupboard...

216
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,320
There's no need for that, dad. It will
only be a waste to buy stuff for him.

217
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,320
Brother, you don't even know
how to take care of your stuff.

218
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,280
I'll take it, okay, Dad?
Don't be jealous, sister!

219
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
Mom!

220
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
- Six. Seven.
- Mom!

221
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,240
Eight. Nine. Ten.

222
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,360
One. Two. Three.

223
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Four. Five. Six.

224
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,480
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

225
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
- One. Two.
- So many money.

226
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
- I can even get married with this money.
- Three. Four. Five.

227
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,600
Why did you take the money from the safe?

228
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,800
- What are you going to do with the money?
- Dad asked me to.

229
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,080
I just asked for the money from your dad!
Don't you dare use it!

230
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,520
I want to pay the mortgage,
car, kitchen appliances!

231
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,960
Put back the money!

232
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,240
- But dad asked me to take the money.
- Just put it back.

233
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,720
- But dad...
- Put it back!

234
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,920
Put it back. Don't be stubborn.

235
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Dad allowed it, but not mom.

236
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,680
One. Two. Three.

237
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,840
My back.

238
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,680
MACHA'S WORKSHOP

239
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,400
Here's your block. I think
it's good enough. So, how is it?

240
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,080
Here, try to change it.
It came from the best place.

241
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
- Cha!
- What?

242
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,520
- It's not good enough.
- What? Not good enough?

243
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Just kidding.

244
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,440
Hey, I did your carburetor as well.

245
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,680
I already borrowed a spanner from Botak.

246
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,520
He lends you his stuff?

247
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,920
I gave him something he wanted,
that's why he lend it to me.

248
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,920
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

249
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,680
Wow.

250
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
New paint job.

251
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,480
Orange and silver.

252
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Who's bike is that? He just bought it?

253
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
He's one of my boys, doing some jobs.

254
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
Jobs?

255
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,520
Nice helmet.

256
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,640
BGH 9234.

257
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Just came out?

258
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,720
You really take care of your bike, hey?

259
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,840
How much was the down payment?

260
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
I bought it with cash.

261
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Cash?

262
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Parents' money?

263
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,560
My dad passed away.

264
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Madi?

265
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
Joe, come here.

266
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Here.

267
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
Since you've bought a super bike,
you really have no time for me.

268
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880
- How's Lan?
- I just came from Lan's workshop.

269
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,800
I was there for some time.

270
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,080
I changed some of the parts.
The price is high.

271
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Are you up for it?

272
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,160
- Just tell me when.
- Cha, borrow me your lighter.

273
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,000
Hold on.

274
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,480
Give me one cigarette.

275
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Lighter?

276
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,880
When do you want to setup the bike?

277
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
Let's do it tomorrow
since I'm working half-day.

278
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
- Who's going to assemble this?
- Do it yourself.

279
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Hey! That's my dad's bike!

280
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,920
Madi, keep the bike clean!

281
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,720
You can do it, I assure you.

282
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Come, let's go!

283
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,200
Let's go!

284
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,680
Come on, let's go!

285
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,320
Police! Police! Run! Run!

286
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,400
RM50! Even school kids can pay it.

287
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,600
RM50!

288
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,480
All you did is talk, give me RM50!

289
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,120
Hey, this is only RM20.
Give me another RM50.

290
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,160
That's a lot of money, Cha.

291
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Don't think of go into debt.

292
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,400
Shut up! Do you want to race, or not?

293
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,200
- Yes, of course!
- Then, what are we waiting for?

294
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,040
How much did you get?

295
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,040
Bro, what about my share?

296
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,920
Here, take this.

297
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,280
This is my share.

298
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,200
Come on!

299
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,440
Quick! Quick!

300
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,200
Come on!

301
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,880
Quick!

302
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Quick! Quick! Get ready!

303
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,920
Let's go!

304
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,160
Alright. Here is the money.

305
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,080
Go!

306
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,680
Come on!

307
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,760
Let's go!

308
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,720
A 125 managed to catch-up with a TZM?

309
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,840
- I know, right?
- This kid is pretty good.

310
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,840
Bro, I think something
is wrong with the sprocket.

311
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,480
I can't go fast with this sprocket.
Can you change it?

312
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
Can you massage me, baby?

313
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,600
Are you tired, baby?

314
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,520
Your baby.

315
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,800
Let's go eat after this?

316
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,600
I don't know why, but suddenly,
I feel like eating Kuey Teow.

317
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,880
Are you up for it?

318
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,560
Macha is treating us.

319
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,560
No problem.

320
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,920
You ate just now.
Do you still want to eat?

321
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Let's eat when you're done.

322
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,480
Can I come with you tonight, baby?

323
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,160
- Come with me?
- You have a game tonight, right?

324
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,320
- I'm bored at home alone.
- What about your parents?

325
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,000
They all went back home.

326
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,600
- So, don't worry about it.
- Really?

327
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Then, it's better if I go
to your house instead.

328
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,280
It's much more fun that way, right?

329
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,080
Damn, you guys! Get a room, will you?

330
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,320
Why are you so jealous? Right, baby?

331
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,840
He's jealous.
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

332
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,040
Yes. Mom? Okay, I'm coming.

333
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,840
Baby, do you want to
go there or home first?

334
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,560
It's easier if we go there.

335
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,360
Hey, I want to come too. I can cook.

336
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,200
You guys can race if you guys want to.

337
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,400
- You can bring your Play Station.
- You are totally right.

338
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,160
I can handle the cooking.

339
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,080
Why did you ask him to come?

340
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,840
Hey, it's not even your house.

341
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,000
What here, okay? Let me pray first. Wait!

342
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,600
At least let me win this bet tonight.

343
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
- Ride your bike carefully.
- Wait for me at the finishing line.

344
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,000
He will surely win.

345
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,000
- My mom is calling. Just answer it.
- Okay, baby, go, go.

346
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,560
Madi? He's in the toilet.

347
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,000
Why is it so noisy? It's always
like this at the night market.

348
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,840
Later, I'll ask Madi to call you back,
okay? Peace be upon you.

349
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes, baby! You've won.

350
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,720
Serve you right!

351
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,920
Go home!

352
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,600
You think you can beat me, Madi?

353
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm the champion in this game.

354
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,040
This is my PS. I've been practicing a lot.

355
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Hey.

356
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,080
Unfair play!

357
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,640
Let's eat first. Put it aside.

358
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,280
- I'll eat it later.
- Eat while it's still hot.

359
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,200
- Toilet! Toilet!
- Are you running away?

360
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,440
Why didn't you call me?

361
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,880
Let's go out for a bit.

362
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,200
Okay, I'm back.

363
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,240
Let's get it on.

364
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Start the game, Madi. Are you playing?

365
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
- Turn it on first.
- I already did.

366
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,320
Baby.

367
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,360
Baby, are you okay?
Make sure to eat if you're hungry.

368
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
Cha, don't you want to eat?

369
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,160
- Cha, wake up. It's already dusk.
- No. It's nothing. It's okay.

370
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,520
Police? Police! Run! Run!

371
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,880
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's not wait until daylight.

372
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Let's go.

373
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,920
How did you get in?

374
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,920
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

375
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,680
I saw the gate was open,
but nobody answered the door.

376
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
So, I just let myself in.

377
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,120
- What time is it now?
- It's three o'clock.

378
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Hey.

379
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,480
Do you want to come with me today?
My boys want to go on a trip.

380
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,000
We are going to the waterfall.
Let's go together, okay?

381
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,840
Hey, don't! It's cold.

382
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,080
Guys, stop it!

383
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,240
Do you always come here?

384
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,000
With other girls?

385
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,120
What do you mean by that?
I've never done that.

386
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Yeah, right.

387
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
Did I ever bring a girl here?
Never, right?

388
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,800
Never, right?

389
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,040
- No. Never.
- You're jealous for no reason.

390
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,880
Who says I'm jealous?
I already have a boyfriend.

391
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,680
- We are no more than just a scandal.
- Just a scandal.

392
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Stop it.

393
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
It's okay, right?

394
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,480
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

395
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,080
Can I use your place?

396
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,920
Sure, but let me do it first.

397
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
- What do you think you're doing?
- You can't use my place.

398
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,480
Hey, that's not fair.
I won't allow you to do it for free.

399
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,880
Hey, I've been waiting for this
for so long,

400
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,800
but it's okay for you guys
to do it anytime you want?

401
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
Enough.

402
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,640
Get lost. Pity her. Let them be.

403
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,840
She has such fair skin!

404
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,320
That's all you can think about.

405
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,200
That Macha is really greedy.

406
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,560
Let's go.

407
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,360
Come on in.

408
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,480
Let's go in.

409
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,360
Have you eaten?

410
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,560
What about drinks?

411
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,360
I'm thirsty.

412
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,120
I'm not thirsty for drinks.

413
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,280
I'm thirsty for your love.

414
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,920
Can you take off your helmet?

415
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Fuck!

416
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,320
- Is it okay like this, bro?
- Fuck! Fuck you!

417
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,600
Where are you going? Let's do it.

418
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,560
Hurry up, let's do it.

419
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,760
What are you guys doing? Are you peeping?

420
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,200
Shame on you guys!

421
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Let's go.

422
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,160
Eh.

423
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,800
Peace be upon you.

424
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,960
Are you high, bro?

425
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,640
- Toilet?
- It's the door on your right.

426
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,120
Don't disturb me!

427
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,840
Annoying fellow!

428
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,320
Noisy.

429
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
- Rizzo.
- Yes.

430
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,120
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yes.

431
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,080
Yeah right.

432
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,960
Did you forget your friends
because of a girl?

433
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,120
Why would I do that?

434
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,080
- Give me some of that.
- Rizzo.

435
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,960
Bro.

436
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,600
Do you know the guy with the red bike?

437
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,360
Where does he usually hang out?

438
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,520
If I'm not mistaken,
they always play around,

439
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
where is it,

440
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,000
the Damansara area.

441
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,480
- Damansara.
- Why do you ask?

442
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,960
Damansara is not that far.

443
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,440
Komeng.

444
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,880
Do you want to go there with me?

445
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
You scared?

446
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,840
I think it's better

447
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,800
if you go there first.

448
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,000
I have something to do first.

449
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,760
I have to do it by tonight.

450
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,680
What you waiting for?

451
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,600
What else? Get ready.

452
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,200
Hi.

453
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,840
- Okay.
- Let's go.

454
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,480
Do it slowly.

455
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,600
Alright, bro.

456
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,080
- Hurry!
- Such a loser.

457
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,080
Really?

458
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,960
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

459
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,600
Don't worry, he'll get up.

460
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,680
Who's that kid?

461
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,800
What a cocky guy.

462
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
Excuse me.

463
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,800
Peace be upon you.

464
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,760
Can I ask you something?

465
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,640
Who's bike is registered
under BGH 9234, 125Z model, red?

466
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,200
Why do you ask?
Do you want to buy the bike?

467
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
No.

468
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,600
I came to challenge it.

469
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,440
Watch your mouth!

470
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,400
How much do you want to bet on it?

471
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,960
What? Betting is child's play.

472
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,560
I think it's better if we
burn the loser's bike.

473
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,760
So, if you win, you will
set ablaze all the bikes here?

474
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,040
So, what are you saying, stupid?

475
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,120
If BGH 9234 or any of your boys
can beat me, you can take my bike.

476
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,120
But if I win, I want this bike.

477
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,680
Five laps on this track! Okay?

478
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,480
Okay, I want your bike!

479
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,200
Okay! Let's get it on!

480
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,920
- Why did you agree to that, Cha?
- Relax, I know you will win.

481
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,640
Hurry.

482
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,520
Let's go.

483
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,960
Are you sure about this, Cha?

484
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,880
Quick! Quick!

485
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Get ready!

486
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,240
Be careful!

487
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,800
Okay.

488
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,240
Go!

489
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,640
Are you crazy?

490
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,080
- What made you think we can beat a TZM?
- Trust me.

491
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,760
What's up, bro?

492
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,000
Park your bike here
and watch me burn the bike from there.

493
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,280
- Madi, calm down.
- You better watch out.

494
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,840
- Relax.
- Just shut it!

495
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,200
- Where's Macha?
- I'm not sure.

496
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,680
- Hey, where's Macha?
- So, how is it going to be?

497
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,000
I've been waiting for so long.

498
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,200
Can I ride with you?

499
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,880
No. Can't you see that
I'm in the middle of a race here?

500
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,920
Don't you know that I'm a hardcore rempit?

501
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,400
I like "Mat Rempit".
Please let me ride with you.

502
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,720
After I ride with you,
you can "ride" me later.

503
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,000
- Follow me.
- Where are we going?

504
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,600
Just follow me.

505
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,680
- Where are we going?
- Before I came here, I was...

506
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,640
That's is so rude!

507
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,680
Chase him!

508
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,560
DBKL'S HEADQUARTER

509
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Stand up.

510
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,040
Pick him up!

511
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,240
You really are a fool!
Do you know what you have done?

512
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,920
That is Spark's bike, bro! Spark's bike!

513
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,680
Eat this!

514
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,240
Serve you right!

515
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,040
You made me angry!

516
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,200
Damn you! Show me his leg.

517
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,200
Show me your leg.

518
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,280
Destroy the bike.

519
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,760
Oh, no!

520
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,560
Spark! What happened?

521
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,080
Yeah.

522
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,000
What's going on?

523
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,560
Let's go!

524
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,600
SIX MONTHS LATER

525
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,000
Quick, quick. Bro,
can I ask for your help?

526
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,880
Bro, I want to put this
RX-Z's head on my bicycle.

527
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,520
Why do you want to do that?

528
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,240
You want to join an illegal race?

529
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,600
Don't kid around.
You want to become like me?

530
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,280
It's not what you think.
This is just for fun.

531
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,480
Okay, that's enough. Ask that guy.

532
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,600
Bro, can you fit this
RX-Z's head on my bicycle? Please?

533
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,080
- I'm busy.
- Please?

534
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,720
My friend and I have been
to many other places.

535
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,760
Ah Kieong, Ah Meng, Foo Kieong.

536
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,440
All my friends have already
fit it on their bikes.

537
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,800
Only we haven't done it.

538
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

539
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,160
Please, bro.

540
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,160
I'll pay you extra.

541
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
Madi.

542
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,680
Let's go.

543
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,480
- Let's fit yours first.
- Here you go, bro.

544
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,160
Peace be upon you. Can you
please take a look at my bike?

545
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,800
- What's wrong with it, miss?
- I'm already late for work.

546
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,480
I don't know what's the problem.

547
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,920
I tried to start the bike,
but it couldn't.

548
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,600
Can you lift that thing?

549
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,800
Mr.

550
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,000
It's useless. I've already tried
so many times, but it kept failing.

551
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,280
I'll come by this evening to pick it up
since I'm already late for work.

552
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,680
- I'm afraid I'll miss the next bus.
- Alright.

553
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,520
Bro. Hey, bro.

554
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,160
It's you.

555
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,560
I thought you were dead.

556
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,040
Come here.

557
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,400
Can you take a look at my bike?

558
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,160
I really pity you.

559
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,040
You can't be a rider anymore,
so, now, you fix bikes?

560
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,800
Take a look down there.
Check my brake disc.

561
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,320
Yes, down there.

562
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,400
Pity you.

563
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,480
After you've checked it,
can you wash my bike?

564
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,960
Alright.

565
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,040
Tell Spark I want a rematch!

566
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,880
RX-Z open match!

567
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,960
You hear me?

568
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,200
Just tell me where and when!

569
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,680
Just you wait.

570
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,800
- What's up?
- I'm really angry now!

571
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,480
<i>Angry, I tell you!</i>

572
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,760
I came across Madi.

573
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,800
My bike needed some repairs,

574
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,200
<i>so I went to a workshop.</i>

575
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,080
I didn't expect him to be there.

576
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,800
<i>You know what happened?</i>

577
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,120
- So, what does he want?
- He beat me!

578
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,520
<i>He's not satisfied. He wants a re-match.</i>

579
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,720
Tell Spark that he wants
to challenge an RX-Z open game.

580
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,800
- Okay. I'll tell him later.
<i>- Alright.</i>

581
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
- Goodbye.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

582
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,440
- What's up?
- She can go faster if I put on the fiber.

583
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,680
I have to change your exhaust as well.

584
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

585
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,840
Spark, Ajak.

586
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,360
Yes, he's with me.

587
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,160
Wait.

588
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,720
Spark, Ajak.

589
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Helo.

590
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,240
Whose bike is that?

591
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,960
Hey.

592
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,560
Macha.

593
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,040
You don't want to give me some of that?

594
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,200
What are you doing with this?
Are you racing?

595
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,000
Racing? This is somebody's bike.

596
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
Where can I find a secondhand bike?

597
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,080
- There is a race at 3 a.m. It's RXZ open.
- Is it Spark?

598
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,920
- Yes, it's from Spark.
- Same.

599
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,080
Where can I get a secondhand RXZ?

600
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,840
Body parts workshop. What was that for?

601
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,120
Idiot. Body parts workshop
doesn't have RXZ.

602
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,720
Idiot!

603
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,520
Peace be upon you.

604
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Macha.

605
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,600
There's no one around.
Are you sure this is the house?

606
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,720
Yes, I am sure. He asked me
to come here. Peace be upon you.

607
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,600
That's him. Here he comes.

608
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,000
Take a look at his bike.

609
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,520
-Peace be upon to you, bro
-Peace be upon to you too.

610
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,880
Bro.

611
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,720
- Bro, this is my friend Madi.
- Hi. My name is Madi.

612
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,360
- Do you want to have a look right now?
- Let's go.

613
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,440
Why you didn't tell me
this guy is your relative? Idiot.

614
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,960
Do I have to tell you everything?
They also greatly indebted to me.

615
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,960
Take it.

616
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,680
What are you waiting for?

617
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,400
- What are you going to do with the bike?
- Actually,

618
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,400
this guy borrowed my bike,

619
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,040
so, I have to borrow this bike from you.

620
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,200
- Are you doing an illegal race?
- Bro, who said that?

621
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,360
With this body? How am I going to race?

622
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,200
I love this bike so much.
You have to take good care of it.

623
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,680
The key? Let me start the bike.

624
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,640
- Are you sure you don't want to sell it?
- Nope. This bike has a lot of memories.

625
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,640
Turn on the choke first.

626
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,760
- Did you pray Bismillah, bro?
- Okay. Okay.

627
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,520
It's not that I don't want to beat him up.

628
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,520
If you see him, you'll feel

629
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,720
sorry for him.

630
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,560
What's the point in beating him up?
It's a waste of time.

631
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,600
Don't create drama.

632
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,040
Do you want me to set up
a race for both of you? You have guts?

633
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,480
Do you really want to do it?

634
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,280
Take a look. My tooth is gone.
It's painful, you know.

635
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,280
It's painful? Are you sure?
Or are you scared of him?

636
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,160
- How many confirmed?
- Four.

637
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,400
- Four?
- Yes.

638
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,080
- How about that kid?
- That kid? No reply.

639
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,280
Mat kental.

640
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,680
- I'm taking my leave.
- Goodbye.

641
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,080
Ajak.

642
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,000
Where's Ika?

643
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,240
What are we doing here?

644
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,280
Let's go now.

645
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,640
Faster. What are you doing here?

646
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,800
Let's go.

647
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,120
Hurry up. Don't do this.

648
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,000
Let's leave.

649
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,200
Hurry up.

650
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,560
Zulaika! Are you taking the day off?

651
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,920
Auntie, I thought there was no one inside.

652
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,160
So, you can just walk in?

653
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,520
The reason why I am here is...

654
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,120
You two can chat.
I need to pick up the laundry.

655
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,400
You can get drinks from the fridge.

656
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,080
Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

657
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,080
When did you take off the casing?

658
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,120
I decide whether or not
I want to take it off.

659
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,440
Why are you here?

660
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,240
Are you in trouble?

661
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,200
I just came here to tell you

662
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,640
to forfeit the race because Spark and his
followers are planning to set you up.

663
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,480
With your condition, you should back off.

664
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,240
When was my leg in a cast? Look.

665
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,120
Look here.

666
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:50,640
I want to repeat that race
because those idiots burnt my bike.

667
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,120
You don't have to lecture me.

668
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,600
Leave, before I kick you out.

669
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,600
He'll be here sooner or later.

670
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,320
Count the money.

671
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,080
- Bro, where's Madi?
- No idea. I'm tired of him.

672
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,600
- We are screwed if he doesn't pitch.
- I have no idea. We just wait.

673
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,760
We haven't seen him since
this morning. It's already late.

674
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,040
I hate to see your face.

675
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:16,280
That guy just knows how to
set up games, but he doesn't show up.

676
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,800
Relax. He'll be here soon.

677
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,120
There he is. Just arrived.

678
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,640
Hey, you're late. You're so late.

679
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,760
What's the deal?

680
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,880
If I win, I'm gonna beat you up.

681
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,160
If I lose, I still want to do the same.

682
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,920
Deal?

683
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,040
Setting until done.

684
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,600
Madi, come on! You can do it!

685
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,440
- How long ago did the game start?
- Yeah.

686
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,040
Where's Komeng?

687
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,920
He went drifting.

688
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,280
So, you guys are going there?

689
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,960
Madi!

690
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,560
What happen?

691
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,760
Quick! Help him!

692
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,680
Madi!

693
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,680
- Madi!
- Oh God, Madi!

694
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,920
Oh, my god!

695
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,480
- Madi!
- Baby! Baby!

696
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,160
- Baby, wake up.
- Madi.

697
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,680
Madi!

698
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,040
Madi!

699
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,400
Madi!

700
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,040
- Madi!
- Wake up, Madi.

701
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,920
- Baby!
- Madi!

702
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,720
Baby?

703
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,920
