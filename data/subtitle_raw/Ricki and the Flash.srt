1
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,610
Whoo!

2
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,005
Yes, Mama!

3
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,044
I love you, Ricki!

4
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,811
- Ricki! I love you, Ricki!
Heh-heh-heh.

5
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,571
Thanks, everybody.
Thank you, my sweet Daniel.

6
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,484
- I adore you.
Aw.

7
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,643
Good evening, Tarzana!

8
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,084
- I owe 10?
That was Tom Petty.

9
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,081
"American Girl" from 197-
What was it, Greg?

10
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,884
- '77.
- Yeah.

11
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,281
'77. WOW.

12
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,090
And, you know,
I am proud to be an American girl...

13
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,482
...born in the best country in the world.

14
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,161
- I know you're proud too, Walt.
- Yes, ma'am.

15
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,682
Yes, sir. Too bad things aren't being run
very well these days.

16
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,929
Anyway, I'm Ricki Rendazzo...

17
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,206
...and I'd like to take this minute
to introduce my band, the Flash.

18
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,921
We've been the house band here
at The Salt Well since 2008.

19
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,567
Yeah, that was the year
we elected you-know-who.

20
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,922
No offense, Billy.

21
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,521
Ha-ha-ha. Whoa!

22
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,286
Yeah, we joke around.
Anyway, speaking of Billy...

23
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,966
...he's the man on keys.
The great Billy Lambert.

24
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,242
- And we got Buster Frye on bass.
Buster.

25
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,651
- Mr. Joey Sweeney on the drums.
Ow!

26
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,207
Newly single, ladies.

27
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,528
Call me, Joe.
And finally...

28
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,205
...my right hand man,
Mr. Greg Sandoval...

29
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,767
...and his sweet Gibson SG.
Yeah.

30
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,082
Whoo!

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,129
And, you know, uh...

32
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,443
I've been told it's not good
to date someone in the band...

33
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,928
...but honestly,
I don't think it's hurting our sound, right?

34
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,728
- We're not really dating, Greg.
Oh.

35
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
Excuse me, is that not
the correct terminology?

36
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,722
Are we hooking up
like my kid says, right?

37
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,967
Yes.

38
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,247
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,650
Well, we've been spending
some time together, yeah.

40
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,764
I spend time with Buster.
I think you and I are different.

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,604
Shit, I hope so. Shit.

42
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,889
Okay, I think this is a conversation
for backstage.

43
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,969
So let's just round it up, okay?

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,004
We learned a tune
since our last gig at The Salt Well.

45
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,602
Because some of you have asked
for more of today's hits.

46
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,086
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,443
- And we aim to please. Okay.
Whoo!

48
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,482
Come on, come on.

49
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,486
Here you go, Ricki.
Margarita for my queen.

50
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,962
- Oh. Thank you, darling.
- Yes, of course.

51
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,605
Hey, Danny,
I'm sorry I couldn't talk before the gig.

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,450
- Vocal rest.
Oh, please.

53
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Vocal rest? She thinks this
is Madison Square Garden. Ha-ha-ha.

54
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,210
- Hey, I-
Great set, man.

55
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,689
- I take things seriously, that's all.
- I know. I love that about you.

56
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,887
I'm sorry that I, um...

57
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,370
Sorry about what I said onstage.
That was just some fun banter. Heh, heh.

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,925
You know, the crowd loves that drama
and tension. Yeah?

59
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,771
- Good one.
- Thanks, boy.

60
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,205
That was just, uh...

61
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,410
Anyway, that was what made
Fleetwood Mac really popular.

62
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,648
- Okay.
Your purse is vibrating.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,606
If she moved with me,
she wouldn't need that kind of thing.

64
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,929
It's probably my manager.
He's, like, 17.

65
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,962
- Three-one-seven.
- Where's that? Bufu, Egypt?

66
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,208
- It's Indianapolis.
- Hm.

67
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,050
It's a telemarketer.

68
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,722
I once got an Old Navy credit card.
It haunts me to this day.

69
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,929
Our barista Maxine...

70
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,684
...has delicious, dairy-free, premium...

71
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,121
Good morning.
- Hey.

72
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,689
Good morning to you.

73
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,402
Hey.

74
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,961
It's ringing up. Okay.

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,243
That's the way it goes. One.

76
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,726
- Okay, that's 447.74.
- Ouch.

77
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,608
I guess that's why they call it
"total paycheck. "

78
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,963
Well, that actually is truly
my total paycheck. Heh, heh.

79
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,967
Four forty-seven, seventy-four.
That's about what I make in a week. Heh.

80
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,327
- How about that?
- Ooh.

81
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,848
And you'd like $150 cash back.

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,451
Yes, please.

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,411
Can an associate
meet a customer in frozen foods?

84
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,961
There you go. There's your receipt.

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,003
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, sir.

86
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,207
Have a good day.

87
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,688
- Let me know how you like those cookies.
Yeah, right.

88
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,569
- Hey.
- You alienated the customer.

89
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,242
- I need you to satisfy...

90
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,568
...and delight the customer.

91
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,523
Okay. I'm sorry, Troy.

92
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,805
No, it's okay. Just remember, gratitude.

93
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,366
- Cool. Thanks. Hi.
Hi.

94
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,164
Thanks.

95
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,525
Come on.

96
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,968
- Hello.
- Linda?

97
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,401
You actually picked up.
I was expecting...

98
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,649
...maybe you'd gotten, you know,
another new phone number.

99
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,245
I'm sorry. I don't have-

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,331
I can't figure out how to set up
the message box thing.

101
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,602
You know me. Ha-ha-ha.

102
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,330
Oh, yeah.

103
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,006
Yeah.

104
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,567
What's the problem, Pete?

105
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,651
It's Julie. Max left her.

106
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,123
Where'd he go?

107
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,531
"Where'd he go?"
He left her. He's divorcing her.

108
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,722
He met someone new.

109
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,445
How is Julie?

110
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,246
Well, that's really why I'm calling you.

111
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,081
She's not well.
She's absolutely unhinged.

112
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,760
She's been here at the house now
for a few days.

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,810
She hasn't changed her clothes,
she hasn't showered.

114
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,249
Uh, she's a wreck. I'm worried.

115
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,164
Okay.
How is your wife handling all this?

116
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,045
Maureen is in Seattle
visiting her father.

117
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,403
- He is failing.
- Oh, right.

118
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,489
He has Alzheimer's.

119
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,331
No, it's ALS.

120
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,810
Yeah, that's short for Alzheimer's, right?

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,407
No, it's not.

122
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,606
Okay, so how can I help?

123
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,531
Well, um...

124
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,051
...you could be there for your daughter.

125
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,964
Linda?

126
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,601
Oh, yeah.

127
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,730
Please have IDs
and tickets ready to view.

128
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,604
Belts and shoes off, please.

129
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,009
If you have a laptop,
please put it in a bin by itself.

130
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,282
Please take your keys, cell phones
and metal objects out of your pockets.

131
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,807
- Who are you dropping off?
- Uh, Ricki Rendazzo.

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,570
And you're here to see...?

133
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,722
The Brummels. Pete Brummel.

134
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,811
Can I see some ID?

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,765
- What?
- ID, ma'am.

136
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,606
Here you go.

137
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,764
Thank you.

138
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,848
This says "Linda. "

139
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,284
Yeah, that's my given name, but Pete
knows that I prefer to go by Ricki...

140
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,051
...so I'm sure he'll probably-
- Here you are.

141
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,685
Linda Brummel.

142
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,050
Oh.

143
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,126
I don't have any money.

144
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,206
Let me.

145
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,364
Here. I'll get those.

146
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,364
Hey, who is this?

147
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,324
Is this Ralphie?

148
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,204
No, that's Sigma.

149
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,402
Ralphie passed away a few years ago.

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,728
- Excess bloat.
- Aw.

151
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,567
Well, then we're new
to each other, huh?

152
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,330
How was your flight?

153
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,727
It was fine, but travel has really changed
since we took the kids to Disney World.

154
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,684
That was 1988.

155
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,247
Yeah. No, I just mean, you know...

156
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,762
I remember when flying was a treat.
People got dressed up even.

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,442
Now I see these young girls in the airport
in their jammy bottoms.

158
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,565
Yeah. Well, I can see
you still put in the effort.

159
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,240
Thanks, Pete.

160
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,204
This is some place.

161
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,448
This is like a mansion.

162
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,883
Thanks.
Yeah, well, double-height entry...

163
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,448
...and Maureen had to have Palladian
windows, so we put those in.

164
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,647
Very classical.

165
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,009
Yeah. I feel like Jefferson at Monticello.

166
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,851
- I'll go tell Julie you're here.
- Heh, heh.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,128
Okay. I'll just have a look around.

168
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,482
Okay. Julie?

169
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,363
Oh, my God.

170
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,645
Look at this place.

171
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,770
Mm-hm.

172
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,691
Mm-hm.

173
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,011
Mm. My, My, My-

174
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,009
Wow.

175
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,087
Man.

176
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,643
Uh, Julie's pretty tired.
But she's glad you're here...

177
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,411
...and looks forward to seeing you
in the morning.

178
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,244
Wrong. No, no, no.

179
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,764
Julie is not looking forward to shit!

180
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,169
Hey, Ju-jee.

181
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,727
Nice of you to grace us
with your presence.

182
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,771
Couldn't make the wedding, but here
you are right in time for the divorce.

183
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,049
Okay. Nobody wanted me
at that wedding.

184
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,443
Do you have a gig or do you always
dress like a hooker from Night Court?

185
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,968
Going through a separation,
it can be a crazy time.

186
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,846
I'm not crazy, Dad.
I've actually never felt such clarity.

187
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, there's actually a book
called Crazy Time.

188
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,525
- Oh, shut up, Pete!
- Honey, listen.

189
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,242
This whole thing is not a big deal.

190
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,768
- I read something in Parade magazine.
- No big deal?

191
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,405
A lot of women your age...

192
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,929
...having starter marriages and-
This was not a "starter" marriage.

193
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,726
I was gonna marry Max,
stay with him, have kids...

194
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,366
...and actually raise them to adulthood.

195
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,404
Oh, okay. Julie, just take it easy.

196
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,170
Why are you defending her?

197
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,771
- She is your Max.
What?

198
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,327
She walked out on you...
- Hey, no.

199
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,686
- ... just like Max walked out on me.
- But I was never unfaithful, Julie.

200
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,724
Jujeeun

201
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,930
So, um...

202
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,649
- We'll try again in the morning.
- Yeah, of course.

203
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,449
I'll, uh, give you a ride to the hotel.

204
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,571
Oh...

205
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,882
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

206
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,169
L- I'm so sorry.

207
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,364
I could hardly afford the plane ticket,
you know?

208
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,130
And, uh...

209
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,688
- Well, you know, I lost my car.
- Yeah.

210
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,565
- I'm filing for chapter 11.
- I know.

211
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,924
So I just thought since you and Maureen
built this big, new house...

212
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,727
...that it wouldn't be a problem.
- it's not a problem, space-wise.

213
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,967
It's, uh...

214
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,764
It's just...

215
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,927
I don't know, a boundary thing.

216
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,448
- But it's fine.
- Mm.

217
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,001
Hope Maureen doesn't mind.

218
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,282
No, Mo's very chill.

219
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,689
I'm the one that tends to get worked up
about certain things.

220
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,048
Maybe Julie gets that from you.

221
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,567
- The bathroom is en suite.
- Oh.

222
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay.

223
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,851
So, um, welcome.

224
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,644
Sigma, come.

225
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,330
Come.

226
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,208
- I trained her myself.
- Heh-heh-heh.

227
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,204
Okay, well...

228
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,965
- Welcome.
- Okay.

229
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,889
Good night, Linda.

230
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,686
Good night, Pete.

231
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,047
Linda.

232
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,402
- Linda!
- Huh?

233
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,487
I was a real bitch last night, huh?

234
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,645
Well, it was late. Heh.

235
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,724
My therapist has me on Effexor,
and we need to titrate down a little bit...

236
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,641
...because it's made me volatile,
anorgasmic.

237
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,363
You're having orgasms?

238
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,961
Anorgasmic. "An" means "not. "

239
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,531
- it's Latin.
- Oh, I-

240
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,326
Yeah, I know. I knew that.
I just didn't hear you.

241
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,409
- What time is it?
- it's almost 10.

242
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,690
Blowing up here, Mom.

243
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,163
Who's Greg?

244
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,251
He's the lead guitarist in The Flash.

245
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,726
The Flash?

246
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,365
My band, The Flash.

247
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,484
I sent you the Facebook page
a long time ago, remember?

248
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,210
Give me the phone.

249
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,926
- He calls you "babe. "
- Yeah, that's an L.A. thing.

250
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,244
Uh-huh. He also makes copious use
of the smiley face emoji.

251
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,529
As well as the cat
with the hearts for eyes.

252
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,562
- How long has Greg been getting it in?
- Hey, let's go to Krupke's.

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,968
I need a doughnut.

254
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,887
Uh, I don't have any money.

255
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,491
You have a credit card?

256
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,688
Yeah, but it's linked
to Max's account.

257
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,726
Oh, that's not a problem.

258
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,405
Hop in.

259
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,247
You know, it's hard to find a good cruller
in California. Heh, heh.

260
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,646
I guess you got to give up a lot
of special things to become a rock star.

261
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,521
Crullers were the least of it.

262
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,770
Yeah, Linda, that was the subtext.

263
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,483
Listen, honey, I came out here
because I wanted to help you.

264
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,325
I know you're in shock right now, right?

265
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,171
And I know
you're probably feeling lost.

266
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,567
I tried to kill myself.

267
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,763
You- You-

268
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,566
Hm. Dad didn't mention that.

269
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,041
Oh. Really?

270
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Three Fridays ago, Max told me that
he was in love with a girl named Nicole...

271
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,008
...who works in traffic.

272
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,450
- Julie-
- I thought for a while about what to do...

273
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,723
...and ultimately, I decided...

274
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,521
...to take a bunch of sleeping pills.

275
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,806
I had them on hand
because I'm an insomniac.

276
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,649
Like me.

277
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,606
And millions of other Americans, yeah.

278
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,008
What are you doing?

279
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,400
I can't believe-
I can't believe you tried to kill yourself.

280
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,888
Julie, you- You're precious.

281
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,927
Listen, a lot of horrible things
have happened to me since you left.

282
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,805
- Oh... Don't.
- This is just the incident you know about.

283
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,126
Excuse me.

284
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,963
- Could you guys take this outside?
- What, are you listening in?

285
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,083
That is so Midwestern.

286
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,327
Excuse me.

287
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,887
Hey, you can't raise kids
in a bubble, man.

288
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,970
I can enjoy my time with my kid
when it's my weekend.

289
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,210
Your weekend? Maybe you should've
tried to stick it out with her mother...

290
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,404
...instead of leaving
the second that your boner wilted.

291
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,850
Let's go, Journey. Come on.

292
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,929
Journey?

293
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,480
- Ugh.
- Aw.

294
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,642
That's sweet.

295
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,246
I like that name.

296
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,965
Oh, you would.

297
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,604
It's a great band.

298
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,881
He lays this one
right down the center of the fairway.

299
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,487
Unh!
- Oh.

300
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,690
You went to Krupke's. I was wondering
where you went. You bring one for me?

301
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,410
Nope.

302
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,128
She's eating.

303
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,363
Our child attempted
suicide and you didn't tell me?

304
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,683
I didn't- I didn't even find out
till the day after, okay?

305
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,724
And I was little more concerned with Julie
than Ricki.

306
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,402
- You should've called and told me.
- I did. That's why you're here.

307
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,365
I didn't realize that she was suicidal.

308
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,244
I thought she was just depressed
because of Max leaving.

309
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,602
Depressed?
No, I could've managed that.

310
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,485
No, I'm-
Julie's always been a moody kid.

311
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,001
I wouldn't have even bothered
to call you.

312
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,247
Well, why not?

313
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,091
Because, Linda,
you don't really give a damn.

314
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,645
Yes, I do!

315
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,406
You shut me out of this family.

316
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,840
I shut you out?

317
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,249
- Yup.
- You came back here from California...

318
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,487
...if you recall...

319
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,690
...with a chip on your shoulder.
You were shut down.

320
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,484
- Well, I did come back.
- Well-

321
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,564
- You had moved on.
- I had to move on.

322
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,650
I wanted the kids to have a mother
who was there!

323
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,207
- It was my dream, man.
- And stupid me.

324
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,041
- I thought we were your dream.
- I can't have two dreams?

325
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,126
- No. In fact, Linda, you can't.
- Hey, you guys are fighting.

326
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,607
It's like the '80s all over again.

327
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,768
Too bad Adam and Josh aren't here
to relive the trauma.

328
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,765
- Oh, good grief. Oh.
- That's enough.

329
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,324
Speaking of, uh, Josh and Adam, um...

330
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,251
...I let both the boys know
that you came into town.

331
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,885
Oh. Q"

332
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,970
- Do they wanna see me?
- Josh does.

333
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,207
Adam doesn't.

334
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,880
In fact,
they're up for dinner this evening.

335
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,130
Josh is gonna bring his girlfriend, Emily.
They've gotten pretty close.

336
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,450
- Mm. Is Adam bringing anybody?
I-

337
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,164
I don't think so.

338
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,090
Well, I'll have all my kids in one room.

339
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,689
- What a treat.
Yeah.

340
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,121
It should be really enjoyable.

341
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,001
Hey, here's Ricki.

342
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,850
Oh, tell her we love her.

343
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,611
I gotta be careful with the L word.
She's gun shy.

344
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,649
Oh, you'll get there.

345
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,645
- Hey, babe.
- So, uh, my daughter, Julie...

346
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,491
...she apparently, uh...

347
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,441
She tried to kill herself
with sleeping pills.

348
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,526
Oh, man.

349
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,200
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Whoa.

350
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,129
How is she?

351
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,565
Oh, no, no, she's okay. She's okay.

352
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,081
- But, uh...
- I don't know what to say.

353
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,124
I mean, you know my son, Derek,
freaked out on acid...

354
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,529
...but it was an accident.
- I blame myself.

355
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,801
No way.

356
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,367
Blame that punk that cheated on her.

357
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,281
You got on the plane to Indiana
to be by her side. You're a great mom.

358
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,481
Oh...

359
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,809
I'm seeing my boys tonight.

360
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,411
Oh, that's great.

361
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,926
Enjoy it, okay?

362
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,521
I'm scared. I'm just-

363
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,720
- They're all grown up now.
- No.

364
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,845
No, you grow them, you know them.

365
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,408
They're the same kids whose diapers
you changed way back when.

366
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,321
Enjoy it.

367
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,242
Mr. Brummel, it's nice to see you.
Hi, Mabel. Nice to see you.

368
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,881
- Thanks for squeezing us in.
- Anytime.

369
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,163
- Your party is waiting. Yup, follow me.
- Oh, okay.

370
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,488
Five minutes late.

371
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,051
Yeah. So now we have to-

372
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,089
Here she comes.

373
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,847
Oh, boy.

374
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,528
Josh. Hey.

375
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,530
- Hi, Mom.
Aw.

376
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,044
Josh.

377
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,288
This is my girlfriend, Emily.
- Hi.

378
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,881
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Linda.

379
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,731
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey. That's Ricki Rendazzo.

380
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,361
You're in the presence of greatness.
Don't forget.

381
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,931
Heh. Adam.

382
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,441
You look so handsome, sweetie.

383
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,728
Oh, thanks, Mom.

384
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,400
Why don't you take that seat?
We can flank them.

385
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,645
- Good to see you. Sorry we're late.
- Yeah, you are.

386
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,888
Nice to see you're so punctual.

387
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,241
It's okay.

388
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,643
Can I get you some drinks?
Would you like another martini?

389
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,002
Yeah. Why not? Keep them coming.

390
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,481
- I'll just have water.
- Me too, water.

391
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,849
With Scotch.

392
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,324
So, um...

393
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,804
How is Maureen's father doing?

394
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,681
Oh, not well at all.

395
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,920
No, the disease is progressing
more rapidly than they'd anticipated.

396
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,088
So you've met Maureen?

397
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,691
Yeah, of course.

398
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,484
Lots of times. Heh, heh.

399
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,806
Mo's great.

400
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,287
- Yeah.
Yeah, she's...

401
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,927
Emily and I have been together
for almost two years.

402
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,930
- She's met the whole family.
Yup.

403
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,125
- Yeah.
- Em, why aren't you wearing your ring?

404
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,523
Your engagement ring.

405
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,887
You two are engaged?

406
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,610
Yes.

407
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,126
Yup.
- Yeah.

408
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,527
Josh got Emily
this conflict-free diamond.

409
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,047
He proposed at the lake.
We were all there.

410
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,730
It was beyond gay.

411
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,485
- It was lovely. It was lovely.
I'm happy for you.

412
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,325
So happy for you, honey.

413
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,564
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,890
Well, we, uh, wanted to keep
things quiet for a while...

415
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,563
...so we could enjoy the news privately.
Oh.

416
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,206
But Julie said everybody
was at the proposal.

417
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,243
Did this just happen?

418
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,568
- Yeah. Yeah.
No. No, it was-

419
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,683
- No. It was July 4th.
Yeah.

420
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,610
So that was months.

421
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,205
Months ago.

422
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,802
We all know you're going through
something, but you're cray-cray.

423
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,844
We were planning on
telling you tonight in person.

424
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,644
Because I hadn't met you and-

425
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,050
Why don't you be honest and tell Mom
that you don't want her at the wedding?

426
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,169
Would you be interested
in hearing our appetizer specials?

427
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,050
- Yes.
- No.

428
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,567
We're practically eloping, Mom.

429
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,526
Yeah, it's gonna be very small,
very green.

430
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,963
Not gonna be a big, formal wedding
like the one Julie had.

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,283
- Thanks for referencing that.
- Yeah, well, thanks for this.

432
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,324
I'm still having Ambien shits
from my suicide attempt.

433
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,649
- You wanna talk about my wedding?
- it's okay. Go ahead.

434
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,123
You know, it won't hurt my feelings
if you decide to elope.

435
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,845
Your dad and I eloped.

436
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,850
- It was great.
- Yes, it was.

437
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,081
Yeah. So, anyway,
this is wonderful, wonderful news.

438
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,964
- Thank you.
Wonderful.

439
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,448
Hey, Adam, when are you gonna
settle down and get married?

440
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,369
Who wants some appetizers?

441
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,723
- Mom, I'm gay, as you know.
- You used to love the carpaccio.

442
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,366
And unfortunately...

443
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,484
...many of my fellow gay men
still can't get married.

444
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,002
Well, I didn't mean to a man
necessarily.

445
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,040
- Who would I marry, then?
- Well, I thought you were bisexual.

446
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,131
That was my cover story in college,
like, 10 years ago.

447
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,644
I'm really sorry that you didn't stay
updated on my sexuality...

448
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,885
...but then again, you didn't stay updated
on much of anything. Am I right?

449
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,244
Okay. Okay. Now that I know that you
decided to say you're completely gay...

450
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,161
- "Decided"? You are such a homophobe.
- ... I won't ask about it again.

451
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,001
This is what she does. She costumes
herself as this edgy rocker...

452
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,521
...who's cooler
than the other PTA moms...

453
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,724
...when in fact,
she voted for George W. Bush twice.

454
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,285
I support our troops.

455
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,801
And I'm the one
with the questionable lifestyle.

456
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,123
Huh? Meanwhile, she's running around
calling herself Ricki.

457
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,005
Well, that's a name, not a lifestyle.

458
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,770
I was born gay.

459
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,128
I was born Ricki.

460
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,450
Touché.

461
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,405
This shit-show is making my day.

462
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,729
Is this whole thing a plea for attention
as per usual...

463
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,161
...or are you actually a psychotic bitch?

464
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,409
Hey, don't you dare call your sister
psychotic!

465
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,849
Oh, my God, she's parenting.
Someone get a camera.

466
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,805
Just cool it. This-

467
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,322
Let's- Look.

468
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,851
It's a very rare occasion
that we all get together like this.

469
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,724
Your mother's here, right?

470
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,806
I mean, I know-
I know we've always had...

471
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,044
...some, you know,
issues and personality conflicts...

472
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,686
...but what family hasn't?
- Yeah.

473
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,651
But we are a family, still.

474
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,362
You know, let's- We can put
all that crap behind us, can't we?

475
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,007
And just appreciate the proximity.

476
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,802
I mean, at this moment,
the Brummel family and family-to-be...

477
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,571
...is proximal.

478
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,491
That's special in itself, isn't it?

479
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,841
Thank you.

480
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,566
I would get a bottle of champagne
for the whole table.

481
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,124
No, but that's-
- But I just filed for bankruptcy.

482
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,084
Describe to me how it makes you-

483
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,169
Well, doc-

484
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,124
And thank you for asking.

485
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,450
It's not that I feel unbreakable
or even impenetrable.

486
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,005
It's just-

487
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,124
What is it? Come on, Angelo.

488
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,005
This is a major breakthrough here.

489
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,529
There is a wonderful,
old Italian joke about a poor man...

490
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,846
You're still here?

491
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,689
Hey-

492
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,720
What are we gonna do today?

493
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,163
I have therapy at noon...

494
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,331
...so I gotta go wash my dick...

495
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,330
...or I'll get another lecture
in personal care.

496
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,881
Why don't you skip therapy?

497
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,684
Just today.

498
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,086
Call in sick.

499
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,485
I am sick.

500
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,763
That's why I'm in therapy.

501
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,611
I mean, how often am I here? Heh.

502
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,404
Never?

503
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,851
Honestly.

504
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,441
It's just a shampoo and trim.

505
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,803
You have really good hair.
You should, like, brush it.

506
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,002
She has my hair.

507
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,168
OW! Unh!

508
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,122
Not more than half an inch.
I can feel how much you're cutting.

509
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,891
Why are we so attached to our hair?

510
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,368
Someday you're gonna find a gray hair,
and I don't mean on your head.

511
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,765
No one wants to hear
about your steel wool, Mom.

512
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,888
I look like Nosferatu.

513
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,805
Oh, don't worry, they file them down.

514
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,725
That's 190 on the card
and you can add whatever tip.

515
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,611
Let's leave a nice, big one, shall we?

516
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,165
Hey.

517
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,846
Hey-

518
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,842
You look very nice.

519
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,330
Well- How?

520
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,283
I just made a suggestion, you know?

521
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,448
- She listens to me.
- Huh.

522
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,364
I was a bit of a jerk yesterday.
I'm sorry about that.

523
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,961
The market had- The-

524
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,130
Things have been really stressful
at the company.

525
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,291
Yeah, well, you work very hard.
I admire that.

526
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,806
- You do?
- Yeah.

527
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,800
You used to call me
an uptight workaholic.

528
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,286
Yeah, honey.

529
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,444
- I used to call you a lot of things.
- Heh, heh.

530
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,762
But I changed, Pete.

531
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,007
I have.

532
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,524
I see that.

533
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,169
I mean, I've been trying to get her
to change her clothes for days.

534
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,648
Well, sometimes a girl
just needs her mother.

535
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,724
I guess so.

536
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,210
Here we go. Taste it.
They changed it a little.

537
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,129
No, no, it's the same taste.

538
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,324
- It's- Why would they change it?
- No. I don't know why.

539
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,682
- Holy shit.
- it's a recipe that has-

540
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,723
Oh, my God.

541
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,043
- What?
- Nicole from traffic. This is her car.

542
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,129
But you can't be sure.

543
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
No, I know.

544
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,963
She's got
these stupid stick figure thing-

545
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,926
on, baby.

546
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,251
Oh, she added Max. Oh, my God.

547
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,730
- Let's not vandalize the car. Come on.
- Hey, hey! Let's just go home, all right?

548
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,564
Let's go home.

549
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,245
No, no, no, Julie.

550
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,608
Please, Julie. Julie, wait.

551
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,649
Why did you walk out
on my daughter that way?

552
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,845
- I made a mistake. Got married young.
- If you're too young to be married...

553
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,567
...what makes you think that you're ready
to raise Kenzie and Krash?

554
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,201
It's Kash,
and how do you know my kids' names?

555
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,165
Everybody on Highway 70
knows your kids' names.

556
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,322
Lady, you weren't even
at our wedding.

557
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,971
Julie hates you.

558
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,611
That may be.
I have to live with that every day.

559
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,962
You have to live
with the pain you caused.

560
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,891
- You're the reason she's crazy.
- Julie's not crazy.

561
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,847
Julie is grieving over a very short
marriage to a man who turns out-

562
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,242
That's enough.
You two need to back off.

563
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,842
You. You know, it's one thing
to fall in love with somebody.

564
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,529
It's quite another to encourage him
to abandon his new wife...

565
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,362
...and then slapping a sticker of him
on the back of your car next to the dog.

566
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,608
Hey, I love my dog, okay?

567
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,842
Yeah? Now you have two.

568
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,365
Oh.

569
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,323
Whoo!

570
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,729
- My heart is dead and rotten.
- Don't say that.

571
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,086
No, a heart isn't something
that's like a steak, you know, that spoils.

572
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,687
A heart is like a Big Mac.

573
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,360
It just sits and sits and sits.

574
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,723
It gets older, yeah,
but it doesn't change.

575
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,442
What? You're saying that
a Big Mac never goes bad?

576
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,166
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

577
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,603
- Interesting.
- It lives forever.

578
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,842
I saw it on 60 Minutes.

579
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,204
- That's disgusting.
- Huh. Well, hm, hm, hm.

580
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,764
But I say- Yeah.

581
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,531
- Yeah, I-
Everybody hitting the hay?

582
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,848
Dad.
Yeah?

583
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,284
It's not even 9 p. m.
I don't think that even Oma is in bed.

584
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,050
Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?

585
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,045
Why is there pot in your freezer?

586
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,167
Uh- It was a...

587
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,125
A coworker gave it to me
for my migraines.

588
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,800
Oh. Uh-huh.
- Which I still get from time to time.

589
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,202
And it's in the freezer
because I read...

590
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,641
...that helps it maintain its potency.

591
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,565
Dad is very efficient,
even with his stash.

592
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,370
I haven't even tried it.

593
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,211
- What?
- No.

594
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,721
What? I mean, no migraines...

595
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,491
...and, uh, I don't like to lose my cool.

596
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,131
Oh, okay.
Ha-ha-ha.

597
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,004
Your what?

598
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,447
- Oh. Okay.
Ha-ha-ha.

599
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,968
You don't think I'm cool. Fine. All right.

600
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,445
All right, then I got nothing to lose.

601
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,291
- Oh, shit.
- Wow.

602
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,288
Whose song is that?

603
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,209
It's mine.

604
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,640
I wrote it.

605
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,571
You wrote that?
- A long time ago.

606
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,524
Damn, Linda.

607
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,131
Wow. I still have your album.

608
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,482
You do not.

609
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,126
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff in the...

610
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,400
I got a Rubbermaid in the basement.

611
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,524
A Rubbermaid? Ha-ha-ha.

612
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,008
Rubbermaid
is a very successful company.

613
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,964
RAUGHS]

614
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,804
Wow, Pete.

615
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,721
You have me in your Rubbermaid.

616
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,447
Oh. Ah.

617
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,404
- Oh, yeah, look at this.
- Oh, man.

618
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,923
- God.
Ha-ha-ha.

619
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,764
Joshy. Ha-ha-ha.

620
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,331
- Look at you.
Fanny pack.

621
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,127
We were pretty damn cute as a family.

622
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,005
Silk Night Sky.

623
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,771
Here it is, my one and only album.

624
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,408
Yup.
Oh, my God.

625
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,087
Look.

626
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,170
- Do you think it would still fit me?
Oh, yeah.

627
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,166
- Should I try it on?
Yeah.

628
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,729
Okay, goodbye.

629
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,888
Hey, where are you going?

630
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,686
Bathroom.
Yeah.

631
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,121
Don't kill yourself in there.

632
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,288
- Pete. Oh, I can't believe it.
- I didn't say that.

633
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,171
- She didn't hear you.
- Can't believe I said that.

634
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,407
Oh, my God.

635
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,365
And you notice, it smells nice.

636
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,324
- It does.
She's gotta be here.

637
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,090
Julie?

638
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,567
There she is.

639
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,171
Come on, sit down.
No.

640
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,325
You're tired.

641
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,201
I'm not a bit tired.
- Out.

642
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,727
See?

643
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,764
You know that little thing
you gave me about Napoleon?

644
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,962
No, what?
- By Robert G. Ingersoll?

645
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,088
Yeah.
- Well, I'm not sure I get that.

646
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,009
Are you hungry?

647
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,684
Are you hungry?

648
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,689
You stay right there.

649
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,251
Arugula.

650
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,488
Nine-four-eight-eight-four.

651
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,288
You just know that
off the top of your-?

652
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,608
- Boom.
- Is it-?

653
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,288
Yes, you are absolutely right.

654
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,811
Of course I'm right.

655
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,287
I know all the PLU codes.

656
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,006
I ring stuff up all day long.

657
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,207
Hm.

658
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,842
Go ahead, try me.
Anything, anything, anything.

659
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,850
- Bananas.
- Organic or regular?

660
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,328
Organic is nine-four-two-three-seven.

661
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,450
Yes.

662
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,608
You're like a memorizing genius.

663
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,725
Yes.

664
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,368
You know, they say, like...

665
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,769
...all kids are screwed up now.

666
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,360
It's the air or the radio waves
or the- The peanuts.

667
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,166
Hey, remember that pediatrician,
the one-

668
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,806
What was his name?
Fa- Dr. Fa- Farling.

669
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,526
Fena- Fenamana.
Fenan- Fenan.

670
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,009
The guy'm Wheaten.
What about mm'?

671
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,329
That doctor. Remember,
he said Joshy was hyperactive.

672
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,763
Turns out he was just drinking
too much pop.

673
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,884
'POD, yeah.
Right?

674
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,370
They know nothing.

675
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,451
Yeah, they know nothing.

676
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,850
We know nothing.

677
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,364
She's gonna be fine.

678
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,204
- She's gonna be fine.
- I don't know.

679
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,045
Oh, yeah, she is.

680
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,850
This is-

681
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,890
No.

682
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,685
- I'm eating that. I'm-
- It's bad for you.

683
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,725
I don't care.

684
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,251
Hm.

685
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,605
Mm.

686
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,204
Pete.

687
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,405
Yeah?

688
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,528
Are you okay?

689
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,885
Uh-huh.

690
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,164
Are you sick?

691
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,810
No.

692
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,084
Did you just-?

693
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,524
Just wanna touch me?

694
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,328
- Milk?
- Nine-four-oh-one-one.

695
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,922
Oh, my God. This is very good.
Yes.

696
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,964
It is so wrong.

697
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,331
- You all done?
Yes.

698
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,370
Should I sit...?
- Be my guest.

699
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,763
- Is-? Who-? I don't understand.
Don't forget the crispy.

700
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,088
What?
Is my bacon not too crispy for you?

701
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,290
- Of course it is. Not.
- He means the French toast.

702
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,920
No, well,
I'm not gonna burn it. My goodness.

703
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,164
- Although, my great grandmother used-
- Oh. There she is.

704
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,566
Hi, Maureen.

705
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,683
Oh, hi. Hi, there.

706
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,090
Well, you're just in time for Maureen's
famous brioche French toast.

707
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,651
How's your dad?

708
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,450
I thought you were in Seattle.

709
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,964
Oh, yeah, well, thanks for asking.
Dad's plateaued at the moment...

710
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,289
...and so they said I should come back
for the time being...

711
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,926
...and I didn't wanna be away
from my family.

712
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,207
Mo, uh- Mo makes the best breakfasts.

713
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,807
Oh, yes, that is all I'm good for, right?

714
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,604
- No, I didn't mean to say that.
- Mm-hm.

715
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,689
So, anyway, I, uh-

716
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,884
I thought I would just take
the red-eye back last night...

717
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,323
...and I got in at 6 this morning.
I feel like a hot mess.

718
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,490
- You don't look like a hot mess.
- Ha-ha-ha.

719
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,484
Linda, you're sweet.
Do you, uh-? You want some coffee?

720
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,488
Uh, Mo makes, really, the best coffee.

721
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,682
Thought her French toast
was the best.

722
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,446
Hard to decide what's best
when Mo's cooking.

723
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,407
Come on, Linda. Sit down.
Have some breakfast.

724
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,361
No, I'm good, thanks.
I'm not really hungry. Ha, ha.

725
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,204
You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

726
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,926
Okay, well, suit yourself.

727
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,600
By the way, you look good in my robe.

728
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,726
Keep it.

729
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,127
Okay.

730
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,321
I'm gonna go out
and make a little phone call.

731
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,967
Okay. Come on, you guys,
let's eat before it gets cold.

732
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,690
- Okay. Uh, syrup?
- No, I have it.

733
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,325
- Can I start?
- After you.

734
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,726
Hi.

735
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,643
Can we talk?

736
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,764
I'm practically naked right now.

737
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,804
I have five sisters.
I've seen a naked lady before.

738
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,570
Well, I just had a brother.

739
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,249
Killed in Nam.

740
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,726
Oh, I didn't know.

741
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,487
So as you know,
we're really concerned about Miss Julie.

742
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,762
She's gonna be all right, you know?

743
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,009
- She's always been a fighter. Heh, heh.
- Well, she's had to be.

744
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,562
Uh, right now, we are working
with her doctor to stabilize her...

745
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,482
...and she's on some meds
and she's been going to therapy as well.

746
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,923
I don't like her to miss a session.

747
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,600
Oh. I don't think one's that big a deal.

748
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,241
I also understand
you gave her some marijuana.

749
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,807
No. Pete did.

750
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,331
It's Pete's marijuana.

751
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,128
For his headaches.

752
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,003
Yeah, we did smoke some. It's a plant.

753
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,611
Okay.

754
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,088
I just think that maybe it's not great
for you to be here now.

755
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,123
You're always welcome
in our home.

756
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,842
And I know Pete thought
it would do Julie some good to see you...

757
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,681
...but I think what she needs right now
is normalcy.

758
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,205
Well, I got her out of those pajamas
and I got her hair done.

759
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,361
And I think she's doing a lot better
since I arrived.

760
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,927
Linda, hey, come on, please.

761
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,966
Please, don't be offended.
I'm just looking out for my kid.

762
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,970
Your kid?

763
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,288
Yeah, she's your kid too, of course.

764
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,007
But, Linda, come on.
Let's- Let's be real.

765
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,044
You haven't lived with her
since she was a little girl.

766
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,720
I was there
for the teen years and college.

767
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,241
She went to college in Milwaukee!

768
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,450
Yeah, and who do you think
drove her ass there?

769
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,163
Who do you think helped her
put together her dorm furniture?

770
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,681
Or paid her bail
when she got that DUl...

771
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,727
...or went to the mother-daughter tea
at that God-awful white sorority, huh?

772
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,884
Who do you think's
been doing all the mom stuff?

773
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,242
Look, Linda, I respect you
as the woman who gave her life.

774
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,649
But after you went to L.A.,
Christmas visits didn't cut it.

775
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,771
There was a hole in this family
and I filled it.

776
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,849
No, no, no.

777
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,002
I tried to come out here to see them more,
but you always made it so difficult.

778
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,647
"Oh, this isn't a good time
because we're doing SAT prep. "

779
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,447
Or, "Joshy has an away game. "
Or- Yes, yes, you did.

780
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,611
You alienated my children from me,
Maureen. You poisoned the relationship!

781
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,211
Are you serious right now?

782
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,243
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

783
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,601
Really?

784
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,646
You know all those birthday and
Mother's Day gifts you got from the kids?

785
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,084
I paid for those.

786
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,405
I sent them. I'm the one who made sure
they didn't forget about you...

787
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,204
...though they had reason to.

788
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,687
You should be kissing my feet
right now.

789
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,928
Bullshit!

790
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,050
Well...

791
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,005
- I didn't want it to go like this.
- Well, that's how it's going.

792
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,684
Do you need help
paying for a flight back?

793
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,443
You wish.

794
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,250
Hey-

795
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,491
Pete's still in love with me.

796
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,246
I'm gonna let you have that.

797
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,243
I couldn't find Julie.
- Oh, okay.

798
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,011
Shuttles aren't so bad.
It's like sharing a taxi.

799
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,567
Yeah, it's great.

800
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,644
Thanks for, uh, calling.

801
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,968
It was nice to see you.

802
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,121
Ultimately, I think it was good
that you came.

803
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,482
Yeah, it was a real...

804
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,491
Uh, fly safely.

805
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,411
I have no control over that.

806
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,683
No.
Wait.

807
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,882
Okay. Later.

808
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,605
Yeah.

809
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,201
Sorry. I'm sorry.

810
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,364
Whoo!

811
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,249
Oh!

812
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,961
Yeah. Thanks. That was
the amazing Edgar Winter. Ahem.

813
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,566
And before that,
of course, The Rolling Stones.

814
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,131
Oh, Mick.

815
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,281
Yeah. Funny thing about Mick Jagger.

816
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,127
He's got seven children by four
different women. Do you believe that?

817
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,442
Get it, Mick! OW!

818
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,921
Yeah. Yeah, busy guy, right?

819
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,201
Yes, ma'am.

820
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,850
Of course, he didn't raise those kids.
He's a rock star.

821
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,167
And more importantly,
he's not the mother.

822
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,609
Daddy can do whatever Daddy wants.

823
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,127
Daddy can go make love
with whoever he wants.

824
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,647
He can take risks.
He can get hooked on drugs.

825
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,604
He can leave and...

826
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,009
Who cares? Some people get hurt.

827
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,601
As long as you get some great songs
out of it. Ha, ha.

828
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,644
Okay. Let's hear
some of those great songs right now.

829
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,245
Whoo!
Yeah.

830
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,611
Hey, by the way, though,
your kids will still respect...

831
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,843
...and they'll love you
because you're the man!

832
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,729
- You know what I'm talking about, girls?
- Yeah.

833
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,888
But if you're a woman, mm-mm.

834
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,330
God forbid you should forget
one school concert or you-

835
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,601
Or a wedding or-

836
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,601
Or you forget to be the tooth fairy
one time because you had a gig.

837
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,640
Congratulations, you're a monster.

838
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,887
Okay, Ricki, I think that's enough.

839
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,641
You're scaring some guys here.
I felt my balls suck up into my body.

840
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,810
Ow!

841
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,163
You didn't need them anyway, Greg.

842
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,244
Ooh.

843
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,205
Yes, I actually do, Linda.

844
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,650
What did-? Excuse me?

845
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,401
What the hell are you doing?
- Let's keep it tight, people. Come on.

846
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,251
Oh, yeah.
You're right, you're right, Buster.

847
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,010
What do we got up next?

848
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,123
We got Pink.

849
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,528
- Pink.
- Ooh. Pink.

850
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,008
Whoo!
- Pink. Let's get this party started.

851
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,321
So?

852
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,329
I'm sorry.

853
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,884
It's been a difficult week.

854
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,249
It's been a difficult few years,
but I still love you.

855
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,323
I can't say that?
Do I ever get to say that?

856
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,411
- Do you love me?
- Of course, I love you. Of course, I do.

857
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,163
- And I love Buster and I love Joey.
- Oh.

858
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,968
I don't mean do you love me like
Wendy loves the goddamn Lost Boys.

859
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,571
I mean, do you love me?

860
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,082
What is your interest in me?
What do you-? What? I don't get-

861
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,131
I'm old, I'm broke,
I can't cook a decent meal, I'm getting fat.

862
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,490
Why would you love a ruined person
who ruins other people, kids?

863
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,407
Is that it? You think because you screwed
up once, you don't get a second chance?

864
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,450
I cheated on my first wife...

865
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,406
...with a stripper who was addicted
to codeine cough syrup.

866
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,523
My kids didn't forgive me.

867
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,006
They're still mad.

868
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,089
I get a calendar for Christmas.

869
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,287
Doesn't matter if your kids love you.
It's not their job to love you.

870
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,166
It's your job to love them.
That's why you were put here.

871
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,962
That's why you're their mom.
That's why I'm my kids' dad.

872
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,644
I love my kids so much.

873
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,451
Don't you?

874
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,291
Yeah.

875
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,808
So you wanna just be friends?

876
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,731
Uh...

877
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,450
Mm-mm.

878
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,284
- More?
- More.

879
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,762
Unh!
- Jesus.

880
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,930
Oh, yeah.

881
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,811
Oh, this rules.

882
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,569
Sorry.

883
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,366
Credit or debit?

884
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,927
Debit.
Hundred dollars cash back, please.

885
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,929
Okay.

886
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,122
- There you go.
- Thank you.

887
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,922
Out of my way. Out of my way.

888
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,128
Okay.

889
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,845
Whoo!

890
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,360
Whoo!

891
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,204
Oh!

892
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,088
I love you, baby.

893
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,884
Dear Ricki.

894
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,722
I'm sorry about some of the words
we exchanged during your visit.

895
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,209
It's a loaded topic and we haven't had
many chances to talk about it.

896
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,289
Please accept this olive branch...

897
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,609
...and I hope we can try again
on better terms.

898
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,603
Enclosed, please find something I feel
you should've received a long time ago.

899
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,723
You're entitled to it.

900
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,729
Hope to see you on the big day.

901
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,524
Maureen.

902
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,527
"Emily Anne. Joshua Hendrix. "

903
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,845
"In lieu of a gift, please make a donation
to one of the following charities. "

904
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,566
Oh, my God. That's crazy.
Who gets married...

905
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,240
...and doesn't milk it for free stuff?
- My son.

906
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,280
There you go. Well, for my wedding,
I'm getting a waffle iron...

907
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,290
...and a panini maker and...
- Ha, ha.

908
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,561
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Joe.

909
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,730
"This invitation is embedded
with wildflower seeds...

910
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,048
...and can be planted. " That is bougie.

911
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,044
- I thought you'd get a kick out of it. Ha, ha.
- Yes. Yes.

912
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,050
- You excited about the wedding, then?
- I'm not going.

913
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,686
What? You gotta go.

914
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,684
It won't be sexy without you.

915
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,561
If I show up there,
something terrible will happen.

916
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,962
You don't know these people.

917
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,001
They despise me.

918
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,124
Anyway...

919
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,843
They don't know anything
about any part of this situation.

920
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,840
Okay, I hear you.
But sometimes a boy needs his mama.

921
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,609
Even I need my mama sometimes
and she's literally Satan.

922
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,964
Thanks, Daniel, but I can't go.
I don't have the money.

923
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,802
Greg and I discussed it
and we just can't do it. We can't.

924
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,081
We don't have it.

925
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:52,128
Well, if I had it, I'd give it to you.
I would gladly tithe to the church of Ricki.

926
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,207
Testes, one, two.

927
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,926
- Get up there and sing.
- Yeah.

928
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,841
Come on. Come on.

929
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,850
Ch-ch-ch.
Here we go.

930
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,364
- Ch-ch-ch.
- One, two, one, two, three, four.

931
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,684
Come on, now.

932
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,044
Ow!

933
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,210
Thanks, everybody.

934
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,847
Whoo!

935
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,846
- Where's your guitar?
- I don't know. I felt like playing this one.

936
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,044
What? You hate this guitar.
The banana. Ha-ha-ha.

937
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,208
Come on.

938
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,290
What's going on?

939
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,326
- Where's your '68 Gibson?
- I sold it.

940
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,130
You sold it'? Why?

941
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,847
Yo, Ricki! "Drift Away"!

942
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,485
Yes, baby.

943
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,322
Oh, no.

944
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,563
Oh, my God!

945
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,802
Gorgeous.

946
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,086
Come on out, babe.

947
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,169
I look absurd.

948
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,970
I'm sure you look gorgeous.

949
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,481
I look like my mother.

950
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,684
Well, that's not possible.
Your mother's dead.

951
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,370
Oh, you look beautiful.

952
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,609
Come on,
that is the most amazing blue.

953
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,241
Looks like Roger Daltrey's eyes
from Tommy.

954
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,562
- Thanks.
- Are you finished with these?

955
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,603
Yeah. Do you have anything black?

956
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,882
Black?
- We'll take this one.

957
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,040
Okay. It looks nice.

958
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,647
How do you know these TSA scanners
aren't government mind control?

959
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,084
These days, nothing would surprise me.
See they made me take my toe ring off?

960
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,171
I can't believe that woman, Janet,
made me take the tequila out of my bag.

961
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,607
That was Cabo Wabo,
Sammy Hagar's recipe.

962
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,691
- Does he look like a terrorist to you?
- Told you, you can't bring liquids.

963
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,962
There goes my wedding present.

964
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,611
Oh, I can't do this.

965
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,887
Can't do what?

966
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,449
I can't go to this wedding.

967
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,762
Big mistake.

968
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,849
Gotta call Buster,
tell him we're heading back to L.A.

969
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,886
No way. Come on,
you're the mother of the groom.

970
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,891
There's no understudy, sweetheart.

971
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,126
I'm so scared.

972
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,646
Wow.

973
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,167
- Hi, I'm Bodhi.
Hey, Bodhi.

974
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,089
Hi.
- Thank you for coming.

975
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,045
You can pick up
your table number here.

976
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,766
These are bags for the birdseed toss.

977
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:44,124
Also, Emily and Josh request
that you turn off your cell phones.

978
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,684
Well, I would, but the phone company
beat me to it. Ha-ha-ha.

979
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,969
We take these, right?
- Yes, that's for you.

980
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,681
Would you like a cocktail
before the ceremony?

981
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,080
What are these?

982
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:00,330
This one's called The Josh.
It's ginger beer and small-batch whiskey.

983
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,969
And this one is The Emily.
It's kind of a playful take on a Kir Royal.

984
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,845
- For free?
- Yes.

985
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,001
- I probably shouldn't.
- I think me and my small-batch whiskey...

986
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,363
...are gonna go try and find
the little boy's room. You okay?

987
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,206
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

988
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,689
Linda.

989
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,008
- Linda. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, hi.

990
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,326
Oma.

991
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,602
- How are you?
- Oh.

992
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,087
Oh, I like you, you know?

993
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,681
Even though you ran off on my son.

994
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:50,408
- Oh. I always liked you too, Oma.
- Ha, ha. Between you and me...

995
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,762
...I don't like Peter's new wife.

996
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,285
Peter and Maureen are happy.

997
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,648
Maybe now.
It's only been a few weeks.

998
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,322
- No, it's been many, many years.
- Oh?

999
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,206
I've been looking for you.
Why don't we go find our seat, okay?

1000
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,047
Jeff. Will you show Oma to her seat?

1001
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,169
Thanks. Jeff will take you.

1002
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,804
Take care.
- Hi, Oma.

1003
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,202
Come on, let's go sit down.

1004
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,000
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.

1005
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,401
Hi.

1006
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,082
I'm very busy right now, so I...

1007
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,131
Yeah, sure. Big- Huge day for you.

1008
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,961
But we'll, uh- Yeah.

1009
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,487
Oma, are you comfortable?

1010
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,364
- Thanks. Thank you.
That's her.

1011
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,607
That's Linda.

1012
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,007
She's not even sitting with the family.

1013
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,682
So here we are, gathered here.

1014
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,731
This big tree over us
and the roots beneath us.

1015
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,165
I can't think of a better place to do this
than out here in Mother Nature.

1016
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,607
And now we can open
the wedding ceremony.

1017
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,730
Go ahead.

1018
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,641
Oh. Don't. Don't. Don't run away.

1019
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,928
Walk on.

1020
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,807
Mom. I'm so glad you're here.
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

1021
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,329
- Yeah. Greg pawned his Gibson SG.
Oh.

1022
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,090
- Hi, Josh.
Hey.

1023
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,282
- Wow. Heh.
Yeah.

1024
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,569
Well, we got your RSVPs so late.

1025
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,043
We couldn't really move things around
with the hall...

1026
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,642
...so, um, I hope you guys
don't mind sitting with Emily's cousins...

1027
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,002
...and, like, our harpist. Heh, heh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1028
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,850
No, not at all.

1029
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,929
We'd love to learn some harp licks.

1030
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,884
Okay, bye.

1031
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,561
Yeah, bye.

1032
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,411
It really means a lot to me
that you came, Mom.

1033
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,927
Hi, we're the Bremen Quintet.
Congratulations, Josh and Emily.

1034
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,161
Bye.

1035
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,527
- Congratulations.
- Hi.

1036
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,685
So whatever table we're at,
that's the cool table...

1037
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,729
...okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1038
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,645
Ooh. There's Adam.

1039
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,643
He's a sharp dresser.

1040
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,444
- Come on, go say hi.
- Mm...

1041
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,290
Come on.

1042
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,125
Adam.

1043
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,926
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

1044
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,207
- Um, Desmond, this is my mother, Linda.
A pleasure.

1045
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,006
Hi.
- I see where Adam gets his cheekbones.

1046
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,687
We are seeing each other.

1047
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,042
Oh, that's- That's wonderful.

1048
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,130
Thanks.

1049
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,967
Adam, I'm so glad you met someone.

1050
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,523
Particularly someone so handsome.

1051
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,600
- This is Greg, my boyfriend.
- Adam.

1052
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,165
- Hello.
Desmond, hey.

1053
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,325
- Nice to meet you. Oh, groovy tie, Greg.
Heh-heh-heh.

1054
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:05,007
You're probably too young for this,
but have you heard of Bruce Lee?

1055
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:09,202
Of course I've heard of Bruce Lee.
He's the man.

1056
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,006
Yeah, you look just like him.

1057
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,440
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

1058
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,721
Not even a little.

1059
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,200
You're not even Chinese.

1060
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,404
Bruce Lee wasn't Chinese.
He was born in San Francisco.

1061
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,570
Mm-hm.
Huh. Oh.

1062
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,006
Hope you have a nice time
and enjoy your vegan meal.

1063
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,929
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you.

1064
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,122
I'm a team member at Total Foods.

1065
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,681
- Oh, I love Total Foods.
Ha-ha-ha.

1066
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,770
All you boys do. Ha-ha-ha.

1067
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,843
Okay, she has got to be
heavily medicated.

1068
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,202
I like her.

1069
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,085
Cut.

1070
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,645
Yeah!

1071
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,766
Here we go.

1072
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,686
Aw.

1073
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,042
And how did you meet the groom?

1074
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,282
Oh. Caesarean section.

1075
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,602
Budapest, actually.

1076
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,201
Yeah. It's gonna be, like, I don't know-

1077
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,330
- We need to- We need to go.
- Okay.

1078
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,683
All right, folks.

1079
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,726
- Pete, it- It's time.
Oh.

1080
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,286
Your toast.

1081
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,124
Hm. Well, um...

1082
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,207
Good luck.

1083
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,850
Well...

1084
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,564
All right, speech.

1085
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,606
Thanks.

1086
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,121
Hello, everybody. Ahem.

1087
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,603
Yeah. Hi.

1088
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,770
I'm, uh-

1089
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,681
I'm Rick- I'm, heh, Linda Brummel,
mother of the groom.

1090
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,607
And I remember some of you
from years ago.

1091
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,689
And it's nice to see-

1092
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,731
Nice to see you again.

1093
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,401
Um, yeah, at first I didn't know-

1094
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,966
Whoo. Heh, heh.

1095
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:56,371
What to give Josh and Emily,
you know, as a gift.

1096
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,243
Not only because I don't have
any money, heh, heh, but-

1097
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,002
But, ahem, also because there's so much
I haven't given them.

1098
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,881
I was never a traditional mom, right?
Ha-ha-ha.

1099
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,044
Um, so I won't be
a traditional mother-in-law.

1100
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,641
I hope. Ha-ha-ha.

1101
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,170
So I realized the only thing I have to give
Josh and Emily is the only thing I-

1102
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,728
I have to give anyone.

1103
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,969
I was never much of a housekeeper...

1104
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,688
...or a cook. Ha, ha. Right?
Ha-ha-ha.

1105
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,844
But I am a musician, you know?

1106
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,046
That's all I am.

1107
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,490
And that's what I have to give,
so I would like to give all I have to my-

1108
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,930
My son and his beautiful wife...

1109
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,640
...right now.

1110
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,491
Boys, you can come out.

1111
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,324
Oh. I wanna thank
my children's other mother...

1112
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,121
...for everything.

1113
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,805
- Oh, God.
What happened?

1114
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,167
It's okay.

1115
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,008
Josh, who are they?

1116
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,806
I think that's The Flash.

1117
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,042
I usually have a way cooler guitar.

1118
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,168
This is a tune by Bruce Springsteen.

1119
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,804
And this is for Josh and Emily.

1120
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,690
One, two.

1121
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,809
- I'm just gonna-
- No.

1122
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,007
Well, I was...

1123
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,723
Do something. Heh.

1124
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,246
- I think we gotta go up there.
- What about our first dance?

1125
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,926
- We'll do what we rehearsed.
- Not the right song.

1126
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,804
- Not close.
- We'll be all right.

1127
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,048
And it's too damn fast.

1128
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,924
Aah!
Come on.

1129
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,603
Whoo!

1130
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,450
One more.
