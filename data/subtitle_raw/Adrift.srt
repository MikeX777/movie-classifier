00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:23,980
Richard?

3
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,083
Richard?

4
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,019
Richard!

5
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,058
Hey! Richard!

6
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,010
Richard!

7
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,055
Rich!

8
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,163
Richard!

9
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,747
Please, no. Please, no.

10
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,719
Please, no.
Please, no. Please.

11
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,859
No!

12
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,568
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye, Tami.

13
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,971
Bye.

14
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,180
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

15
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,692
<i>Bonjour.</i>

16
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,033
What is your profession?

17
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,402
Uh, whatever job
pays me enough

18
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:08,804
to get me to the next place.

19
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:15,211
How long will you be here
in, uh, Tahiti?

20
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,614
No idea.

21
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,184
And your final destination?

22
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,657
Okay.

23
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:59,153
Hey. So why Tahiti?
What brought you here?

24
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,290
The wind, I guess.

25
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,656
I was a cook on a schooner.

26
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:03,757
But when the gig was up,

27
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,193
I didn't really feel like
going home yet.

28
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,361
Uh-huh.
Where is home for you?

29
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:08,897
San Diego. California.

30
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:11,466
Nice.

31
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:12,601
When are you going back?

32
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:15,303
Never.

33
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,906
I don't know. Maybe once
I've seen the world.

34
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,526
Hey, mate.

35
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,196
Why's your boat
called <i>Mayaluga?</i>

36
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,997
It's Swazi.

37
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,866
I'm a Kiwi.
I need a translation, please?

38
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,770
"One who crosses the horizon."

39
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,837
Oh.

40
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,775
You, uh... You girls want
to give me a hand?

41
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,448
Wow, this is so beautiful.

42
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,082
Thanks. Here.

43
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:37,951
Sorry, what was your name?

44
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,086
- Richard.
- Richard, I'm Deb.

45
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,355
Hi, Deb.

46
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,325
This is Tami.

47
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,092
Hey.

48
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,829
Tami.

49
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,264
Thank you.

50
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,767
Yeah, no problem.

51
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,211
See you.

52
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,878
Nice to meet you.

53
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,911
You too.

54
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,416
See you around.

55
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,314
Hey.

56
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:13,549
Hey.

57
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,419
I thought you may need this.

58
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,821
How thoughtful.

59
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,956
- Thanks, Tami.
- No worries.

60
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,092
Do you, uh,

61
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,761
like fish?

62
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,464
I'm actually a vegetarian.

63
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,197
- So...
- Right.

64
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,633
I like them
when they're alive.

65
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:33,933
I was gonna see

66
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:37,039
if you just wanted
to grab an early dinner?

67
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:38,874
Uh...

68
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,543
But seeing as you're...

69
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:43,411
Do you know what, I can make

70
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,014
a really good
vegetarian version.

71
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,317
That sounds great.

72
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:51,752
- Good, good. Sold.
- Yes. Thank you.

73
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:53,053
Done.

74
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,991
Do you want me
to grab anything else?

75
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,227
Uh, some vegetables?

76
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:03,333
I can do that.

77
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,636
You've been
to so many places.

78
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:09,737
So cool.

79
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:10,805
Yep.

80
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:11,905
All on this boat?

81
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,509
Uh, just me and her.

82
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:15,545
Where did you find her?

83
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,178
I actually built her

84
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,615
when I was working in
a boat yard in South Africa.

85
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,419
You built this boat?

86
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,253
Mmm.

87
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,655
That's a big deal.

88
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:29,289
That's so impressive.

89
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,225
It's not.

90
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:32,094
It is.

91
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,930
Oh, thank you.

92
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,202
Chin, chin.

93
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:42,104
Cheers.

94
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:54,983
What's it like sailing
out there all alone?

95
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,720
Uh... Miserable.

96
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,356
Cold.

97
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,356
Utterly awful.

98
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:04,792
C'mon...

99
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,126
Seriously?

100
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:08,529
Yeah, seriously.
I mean, you're either,

101
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:12,031
uh, sunburnt, sleep-deprived,
or seasick,

102
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,169
usually all three at once,

103
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,537
and constantly hungry.

104
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:17,838
Hmm.

105
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,540
Always wet.

106
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,277
And after a few days
there's the hallucinations.

107
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,780
I'm assuming not the fun kind?

108
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:27,215
Mmm-mmm. I wish.

109
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,625
If it's not fun,

110
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:38,661
then why do you do it?

111
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,597
Uh...

112
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,200
It... It's a feeling...

113
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,404
A feeling I can't describe.

114
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,074
Uh, it's intense.

115
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,044
The infinite horizon.

116
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,650
After a few days,
uh, I feel reborn.

117
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,352
You know, just you,

118
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,188
the wind
and the sound of the boat

119
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,493
cutting through the ocean.

120
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:17,765
I'm sorry,
that was incredibly cheesy.

121
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,234
No.

122
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,136
Not at all, actually.

123
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,709
So you must be a sailor too?

124
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,977
Mmm...

125
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,712
I love sailing.

126
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:34,582
But I don't know that I would
consider myself a sailor.

127
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:35,883
Oh, come on.

128
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:38,451
- Not like you.
- Yeah, you are.

129
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,455
I don't believe you.

130
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:46,729
Do you want to take her out?

131
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,331
Right now?

132
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,465
Uh, sure.

133
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,803
We could take her out
right now or tomorrow.

134
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,307
Whoo-hoo!

135
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,177
Whoo!

136
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:04,043
Yeah!

137
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:05,380
Arr!

138
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,717
You got it, baby!

139
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,119
You got this.

140
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,588
Yeah!

141
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,258
Hey, the sheet's luffing,
should I pull it in?

142
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,762
I didn't think
you were much of a sailor.

143
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,028
I'm not.

144
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,363
I mean, I learned a few things

145
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,798
when I was a cook
on that schooner.

146
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,637
But definitely never crossed
a horizon all alone like you.

147
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:38,113
There we go.

148
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,181
Whoo!

149
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,085
Richard!

150
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:48,123
Richard!

151
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:52,562
Richard! Where are you?

152
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,484
Mayday! Mayday!

153
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:20,219
This is the sailing yacht
<i>Hazana!</i>

154
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,993
Does anyone copy? Hello?

155
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:28,596
Our last recorded position was

156
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:30,463
a hundred and twenty-nine
degrees west

157
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,531
and latitude twelve north.

158
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,701
Does anyone copy?

159
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:34,770
Hello?

160
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,517
Mayday!

161
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,520
Mayday!

162
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:56,957
Is anybody there?

163
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,224
It's my fiancÃ©...

164
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:00,896
Our boat is sinking.

165
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:03,131
Mayday!

166
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,626
Where are you?

167
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:06,729
Where are you taking me?

168
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,471
This is unreal.

169
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,609
Wow.

170
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,578
Ooh, you're not gonna jump,
are you?

171
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,948
No, of course I'm not.

172
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,985
Shut up.

173
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:33,987
<i>Fly me to the...</i>

174
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,157
Don't! Tami, no!

175
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,762
Tami?

176
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:44,232
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

177
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:01,048
Tami?

178
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,617
Tami, are you okay?

179
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,379
Where'd you become so wild?

180
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:36,185
What? What does that
even mean?

181
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,725
I've never met anyone
like you.

182
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,526
Fearless, like a bloke.

183
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:49,397
Like a bloke?

184
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,734
I guess I've never met
anyone like you either.

185
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,601
Oh, yeah?

186
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,206
Sensitive like a woman.

187
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:19,889
The dinghy.

188
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:29,397
Oh, my God!

189
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:32,834
Rich, you're...

190
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,444
Come on, you. Come on.

191
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,282
Ugh! Dammit!

192
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:11,739
No, no. No!

193
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:36,464
It's drifting.
It's drifting!

194
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:56,517
Stop!

195
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,693
I'm coming!

196
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,864
I'm just going to make
some repairs.

197
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:50,705
All right. Here we go, girl.
Let's get you moving.

198
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:04,018
Looking good, mama.

199
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:06,954
Aah!

200
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:12,927
Hell yeah.

201
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,933
What are you?

202
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:28,910
Got the jib.

203
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,915
Let's get this water
out of here.

204
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,320
Yeah...

205
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:43,057
We can do this.
We can do this.

206
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:54,869
Stay.

207
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,270
No, no, no, no, no.

208
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:08,417
Stay.

209
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:10,283
Stay.

210
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,487
No, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:14,856
Work with me, girl.

212
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,461
Looking good.

213
00:24:26,502 --> 00:24:29,103
All right, baby,
show me what you got.

214
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:30,838
Come on!

215
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:37,444
Coming, baby!

216
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:08,007
What is that?

217
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:11,779
For me?

218
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:13,549
For you.

219
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:19,454
It's not my birthday,
you know?

220
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:22,556
I know. I...

221
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,228
I saw it in a window
and I thought of you. Uh...

222
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,075
You don't like it?

223
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,745
No, I love it. I...

224
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:46,781
It's beautiful.

225
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,976
Okay.

226
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,676
Richard!

227
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,646
Almost there.

228
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:55,651
Hang on!

229
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,032
Oh, my God, you're alive!

230
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,370
Oh, my God!

231
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:01,843
Oh, my God.

232
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,747
Hi. Hi.

233
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,017
Hi, I'm here. I'm here.

234
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:11,986
Look at me.

235
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:14,454
It's gonna be okay.

236
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:23,430
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

237
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,834
It's gonna be okay. Okay.

238
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,403
It's gonna be okay.

239
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,905
It's gonna be okay.

240
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,614
Okay, tell me, do you, uh...

241
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,382
Do you know what flower
that is?

242
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:45,518
It's a plumeria, right?

243
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,019
It's a frangipani.

244
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,954
- A what?
- A frangipani.

245
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,757
- A frangipani.
- It's a... Yeah.

246
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,090
One second. Here you go.

247
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,959
That's what you call it?

248
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,396
The flower of love.

249
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,700
It's like God
put these on Earth

250
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,602
to mask the smell
of burning trash.

251
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,872
My late mum used to say

252
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,575
that nothing
moves through life faster.

253
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:10,042
In one day, one can open,

254
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:14,516
it can change color,
wilt, and then die.

255
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:17,951
Look...
Here, pass it, pass it.

256
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:19,886
Sometimes
the things that you say...

257
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:21,721
Left or right?

258
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:23,388
Uh... Uh, why?

259
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,290
It's very, very important.

260
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,328
You choose.

261
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:32,364
Basically,
if you choose your left,

262
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:35,033
it means you are technically
off the market,

263
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,769
you're in a relationship.

264
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,439
- Ooh.
- Yeah, so it's...

265
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,640
Well...

266
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,208
Wow, wise choice. Wise choice.

267
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:47,714
- Seven years?
- Mmm-hmm.

268
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:49,749
Wow.

269
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,049
So that would mean
that when you were

270
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,819
beginning to work
on the <i>Mayaluga,</i>

271
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,222
I was celebrating my sweet 16?

272
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,091
Yep.

273
00:30:57,726 --> 00:30:58,958
Jeez.

274
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,895
And was it sweet, your 16th?

275
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:05,264
No. No, my mom
took me to my first bar.

276
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:07,934
I had like 10 shots
of Midori...

277
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:09,167
Oh, my Lord.

278
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,938
Yeah. Worst hangover
of my life, hands down.

279
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,841
So your mum's a wild one, eh?

280
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,341
One of those
young-at-heart types?

281
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:19,946
Oh, she's just young, period.
She was 31.

282
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,346
Oh, when she had you?

283
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,583
No. No, that night.

284
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,352
She was 15 when she had me.

285
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:26,986
Wow.

286
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,956
Got knocked up
when she was just a kid.

287
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,423
Had me out of defiance.

288
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:34,061
My dad's parents
actually raised me.

289
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:36,763
What was that like?

290
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:39,066
It was what I knew.
I don't know.

291
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,102
I made attempts, of course,
to run away.

292
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,838
But Mom worked for TWA,

293
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,774
and I think her
not being around as much

294
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:49,541
kind of forced me
to stick around.

295
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:50,977
Like I owed it to her

296
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,580
to finish high school
or something.

297
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,917
- That makes sense.
- I guess.

298
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,920
But, man,
the day I graduated, I split.

299
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,321
My girlfriend and I
had been saving up,

300
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:04,991
and we bought the sickest bus,

301
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:07,392
drove it across the border
to Todos Santos

302
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:10,697
and just lived on the beach
for a few months.

303
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,031
We started a salsa company

304
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,199
and surfed every day.
It was...

305
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,204
It was amazing.

306
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,371
Plan was to stay
for six months,

307
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:23,645
but it's been five years
and here I am...

308
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:26,547
Here you are.

309
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,886
You ready to shake, old salt?

310
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:33,518
Sorry...

311
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,055
- Can I say no? No. No, no.
- Yes. Yes.

312
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,263
Oh, you have been warned.

313
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:48,067
I'm sorry this...
This is the best I've got.

314
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:51,536
No, you've got more in there,
I know it.

315
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:55,207
Oh, no. No,
you're a much better dancer.

316
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,678
It's the dress.

317
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,276
It is the dress.

318
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,812
That's why you bought it
for me.

319
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,546
Ah, got me.

320
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:21,934
Hey, Tami...

321
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:23,170
Yeah?

322
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,242
Will you sail around the world
with me?

323
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,857
Exhale for me.

324
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:56,836
Hey, it's okay. It's done.

325
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,139
Just breathe.

326
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:04,209
What? What, what, what, what?

327
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,747
My ribs. My ribs. My ribs.

328
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,150
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

329
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,522
Put your arm around me.

330
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:21,328
Ready? One, two, three, lift.

331
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,963
Okay, okay...

332
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,509
Shh.

333
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,416
What about Fatu Hiva?
We could sail there first.

334
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,351
It could work.
It could work, yeah.

335
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,620
As long as we don't
go through Hana Vave.

336
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,090
Everyone goes through it,
it's become a bit of a dump.

337
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,657
Oh, what's the draw then?

338
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,062
Better anchorage.

339
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,361
Lazy suckers.

340
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,197
Omoa Bay. Now that...

341
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,800
That is, I mean,
that is <i>parfait.</i>

342
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:02,135
Yeah? What, the beaches?

343
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:05,106
Yeah.
Just like beyond amazing.

344
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,877
What about Japan?

345
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,945
I've always wanted
to check it out.

346
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,213
- Are you kidding me?
- Mmm-mmm.

347
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,249
It's like
my number one place, like...

348
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,716
- Really?
- Yeah.

349
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:18,719
We gotta go.

350
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:20,287
How long do you think
it would take to sail there?

351
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,122
- Forever. But does it matter?
- No.

352
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:25,958
No. God, I just want to go
everywhere with you.

353
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,126
Then everywhere we will go.

354
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,694
Richard! Richard!

355
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:30,764
Richard!

356
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,433
What? Tally-ho!

357
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:36,768
Where the hell
have you been hiding?

358
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,770
How are you, mate?

359
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,173
Oh, just everywhere.

360
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:41,373
Good to see you,
Richard.

361
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,608
I nearly rang the bloody
coast guard.

362
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,146
Sorry. Sorry, this is...
This is Tami. Tami.

363
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:48,214
- Hi.
- Christine.

364
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:49,714
- Christine. Peter.
- Nice to meet you.

365
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:50,617
- Hi, my pleasure.
- Same.

366
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:52,985
Tami. Yeah, well...
How have you guys been?

367
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,352
- Oh, really good.
- Great.

368
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:56,590
We were just off for a coffee,
do you want to join us?

369
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,059
I'm glad we bumped
into you, Richard, because...

370
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,127
Well, there's something
we'd like

371
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,195
to talk to you about,
actually.

372
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:03,428
The thing is, Richard,

373
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,864
we've got to go back to London
rather suddenly,

374
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,099
and we wanted to ask
if you'd be interested in...

375
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:08,600
Yeah, we've been trying
to find someone,

376
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:11,469
and I don't know
if you'd be keen, but...

377
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,039
How'd you like
to sail the <i>Hazana</i>

378
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,641
back to California for us?

379
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,278
We can pay $10,000

380
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,348
plus a first-class ticket
return.

381
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,349
Seriously?

382
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,352
You're...
You're joking, right?

383
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,021
- No, mate.
- No.

384
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,223
What do you say?

385
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,490
Uh...

386
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,659
Where...
Where in California?

387
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,898
San Diego.

388
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,400
Wow.

389
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,102
Uh... I don't mean

390
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:45,704
to look a gift horse
in the mouth here,

391
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:51,212
but is there any possibility
of making it two tickets back?

392
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:55,647
Done and done.

393
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:59,653
Done and done. Brilliant!
Wow. That is...

394
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:01,954
When do you leave?

395
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,323
Well, we're hoping to get out
no later than next week.

396
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:06,092
And the things is,
we don't want to press you,

397
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:07,226
but it would be great
if you could

398
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:09,095
let us know
when you could set sail.

399
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:11,596
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we can do that.

400
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,167
- Great.
- We can, um,

401
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:16,603
mull it over.

402
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,551
Are you sure
you want to put me in charge

403
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:34,488
of these numbers?

404
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:37,691
I'm shit at math.

405
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:43,097
You can do anything
you put your mind to.

406
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,434
Mom used to tell me
the same thing.

407
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:52,240
And then she would say that
my mind was too strong.

408
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:57,111
Probably should have just been
more like her, huh?

409
00:37:59,147 --> 00:38:02,716
Have kids by now.
Live in the suburbs somewhere.

410
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,517
Well, I'd still be
in the Naval Academy

411
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,221
if I'd listened to me dad.

412
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,527
But I decided to live
my own life.

413
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:29,743
We're...

414
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,380
We're so far north!

415
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:36,417
Well, we are drifting.

416
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:37,884
How far?

417
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:41,222
Way further than I thought.

418
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,623
What's the latitude?

419
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:48,162
Eighteen degrees north.

420
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:58,638
That's like a fifteen hundred
square mile search area...

421
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,681
We're gonna die out here.

422
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,025
We're not on any flight paths,

423
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:21,329
there's no shipping lanes...

424
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:24,598
Tami...

425
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,768
No one knows we're here.

426
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:30,637
We'll be fine.

427
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:53,560
Hey.

428
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:55,829
Hey.

429
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:12,413
You okay?

430
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:14,879
I don't want to feel like

431
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,783
I'm following you
on your adventures.

432
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:24,858
I get that it's
a really cool opportunity,

433
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:30,831
but I'm not really looking
to go home yet.

434
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,968
It's not the direction
I wanna go in,

435
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:39,340
and if that's what
you want, then...

436
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,611
I'm sorry.

437
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,284
I'm not going.

438
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,455
I'm not asking you to do that.

439
00:40:54,888 --> 00:40:55,889
I know.

440
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:00,994
I sailed half the world
to find you.

441
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:05,632
I'm not just letting that go.

442
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:16,643
What?

443
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,380
Ugh.

444
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:26,420
Well, can I see
this big bad boat?

445
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,102
The boat's fifty-five feet...

446
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:47,105
Fourteen seconds...

447
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:50,444
Means we're going about
two... two-and-a-half knots.

448
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:58,082
We could hit San Diego
in twenty-five days.

449
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:01,686
But then with these headwinds,
it could take months...

450
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,458
Well, what if we don't sail
to San Diego?

451
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,093
What do you mean?

452
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,397
I mean,

453
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,365
what if we hang left
and we go to Hawaii?

454
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,702
Like navigators did
back in the day.

455
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:20,206
Yeah, but most of those
sailors didn't make it, Tam.

456
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,340
If you miss Hawaii...

457
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:23,043
I know,
there's nothing till Japan.

458
00:42:24,212 --> 00:42:27,615
It's like a two thousand mile
shot at a moving target.

459
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,851
If we miss Hawaii, we die.

460
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:35,887
We'd be adding
five hundred miles.

461
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,925
Yeah, but the current and
the wind would be behind us.

462
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,862
Okay.

463
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,833
Take a left
on the nineteenth...

464
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:52,172
Yeah.

465
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,641
The moment we hit
the dock, I cried out,

466
00:43:28,643 --> 00:43:31,510
"God, I'm glad to be back
in Rangiroa!"

467
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:32,678
There's a fellow nearby,

468
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,747
he looks to his wife
and he says to us,

469
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:36,814
"You're not in Rangiroa...

470
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:38,883
- "You're in Apataki."
- No.

471
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:40,753
How?
That's like 100 miles away!

472
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,721
Yeah, no shit.

473
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,523
The longest sail of my life,
Richard.

474
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,694
Sorry about that, darling.

475
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:48,627
Well, cheers, everyone.

476
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,928
Cheers.

477
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,698
What's the, uh... What's
the rush back to London,

478
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,899
- if you don't mind me asking?
- Ah.

479
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:58,771
Well, it's Christine's father,
he's not well.

480
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:00,675
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

481
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,241
Will he be okay?

482
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:04,743
He's ninety-four.

483
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,612
It's a good innings.

484
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:08,114
You'd be a life-saver,
Richard.

485
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:16,388
Wow.

486
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,757
This is beautiful.

487
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,224
Oh, Richard.
We're out of ginger beer...

488
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:23,261
We're just gonna go and grab
some from the clubhouse. Okay?

489
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:25,930
Make yourselves at home.
We'll be back in a while.

490
00:44:25,932 --> 00:44:26,866
Thanks.

491
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:36,007
So, what do you think of
the big bad boat then?

492
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,045
I think four thousand miles
is insane...

493
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,748
Yeah, but

494
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,484
in a month
we'd make enough to fund

495
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:47,586
an entire year
traveling together.

496
00:44:47,588 --> 00:44:49,854
- Oh, a year?
- Ah.

497
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:52,056
Who said anything
about a year?

498
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:55,663
Why are you
trying to get rid of me?

499
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,932
Why are you
trying to have sex with me?

500
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,669
Why not? Here?

501
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:05,471
I mean, it's our boat now,
so why not?

502
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:09,075
So you're in?

503
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,713
Just for those first-class
plane tickets.

504
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:20,151
Whoa.

505
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:23,689
- Later, you dirty old man.
- Come on.

506
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:36,535
<i>Dear Mum,
sorry it's been a while.</i>

507
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:40,574
<i>I wanted to let you know that
I am going to be coming home.</i>

508
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,942
<i>I got this job sailing
this gorgeous yacht</i>

509
00:45:44,944 --> 00:45:47,147
<i>from down here
back to San Diego.</i>

510
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:55,554
<i>It's about
a thirty-day crossing,</i>

511
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:58,893
<i>so hopefully we'll get there
right before Halloween.</i>

512
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,325
Come on, come on, come on.

513
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:04,832
It looks like we have
a quarter tank of water!

514
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:11,570
<i>I really hope you're in town</i>

515
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:13,806
<i>because I'm going
to be bringing</i>

516
00:46:13,808 --> 00:46:16,677
<i>my new boyfriend.</i>

517
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,912
<i>His name is Richard.</i>

518
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:23,682
<i>He's a little bit older.
Uh, he's from England.</i>

519
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:26,951
<i>We've only been together
a few months now,</i>

520
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:30,589
<i>but, I don't know, I really
feel like he's the one.</i>

521
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,058
Bon voyage, lovers.

522
00:46:32,992 --> 00:46:34,392
<i>I guess we'll find out</i>

523
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:37,995
<i>after crossing the Pacific
together.</i>

524
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,065
<i>Anyway,</i>

525
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,468
<i>I can't wait to see you
and Gram and Grandpa.</i>

526
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,969
<i>Dad, if he's around.</i>

527
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,106
<i>I'll see you soon.
I love you so much.</i>

528
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:50,776
That's it.

529
00:46:50,778 --> 00:46:52,813
We've eaten
all the fresh stuff.

530
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:57,383
Ouch.

531
00:46:57,785 --> 00:46:59,651
Is this it?

532
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,255
Yeah. It's everything
I could salvage.

533
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:07,193
Here. You need to drink this.

534
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:10,965
Come on.

535
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,182
Okay, close your eyes.

536
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:33,453
Are you ready
to love me even more?

537
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:37,390
Look. Open your eyes.

538
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:39,423
Is that peanut butter?

539
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:40,861
Ha.

540
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:46,967
Do you want a hand?

541
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:48,802
No. I got it.

542
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:57,576
Oh.

543
00:47:57,578 --> 00:47:59,811
How much do you
love me right now?

544
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:01,882
Huh?

545
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:05,118
- Is it good?
- Mmm.

546
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,023
It's so good.

547
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:18,197
Oh, my God.

548
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,102
Wow.

549
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:25,637
So what do you think of that?

550
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:28,072
- Huh?
- It's so red.

551
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:29,808
- Come on.
- What?

552
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,009
What, is that
how you'd describe

553
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:33,077
a painting by Monet? Red?

554
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,746
- If it was red, I would.
- Red.

555
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,648
Yeah.

556
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,316
No. No.
That sunset's not red.

557
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:43,156
That sunset
is beet-dyed pomegranate.

558
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:51,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bob Ross.

559
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:52,931
Can you see... I say
it's kind of got a beety...

560
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,032
It's definitely red.

561
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:55,634
No, no, no.
With a hit

562
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:57,769
of mandarin and flax

563
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,672
and the faintest hint
of carnelian.

564
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:02,708
Red.

565
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,442
Red sky at night.

566
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,013
Sailor's delight.

567
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:09,917
Who the hell is Bob Ross,
anyway?

568
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,251
You don't know
who Bob Ross is?

569
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,251
Should I?

570
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:16,655
He's like
the master of kitsch.

571
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:18,589
Uh, he's like
a modern-day Monet.

572
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,592
You would love him.

573
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,029
Wait a second...

574
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:25,496
Aw.

575
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:29,668
Wait, let me see you. Wait...

576
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,802
Your cheeks,
they're going to...

577
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:31,970
Let me guess,
they're red?

578
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,839
No, no.
It's definitely not red.

579
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:38,209
More like, um,
a sizzling salmon ketchup.

580
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:50,289
Tam?

581
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:52,358
What is it?

582
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:56,229
Hold on.

583
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:04,537
We're off sixty miles.

584
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,274
And we lost a degree
of latitude.

585
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:10,042
We... How?

586
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:12,176
I don't know!

587
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:14,980
Maybe the clock's not working?

588
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:18,182
Or I messed up
the math or something?

589
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,153
We're over eighteen hundred
miles from Hawaii.

590
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:23,354
Fricking rudder's not helping.

591
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:27,861
It's making it
impossible to stay on course.

592
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:40,906
Oi, no, no, no.
We need to ration now.

593
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:42,373
Okay, you wanna
starve to death?

594
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,875
You wanna be a victim,
be my guest.

595
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,043
You make it sound like
it's a choice.

596
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,978
- It is a choice, Tam.
- It's not a choice!

597
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:52,485
Shut up!

598
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:06,632
You okay?

599
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,647
It has a jib
caught on it.

600
00:51:56,649 --> 00:51:57,783
I can't get it off.

601
00:51:57,785 --> 00:51:59,750
Maybe it'll have
to just trail.

602
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:01,420
And create all that drag?

603
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,664
- Babe?
- How is it?

604
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:20,466
It's okay.

605
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:37,175
Is everything okay
down there?

606
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:38,312
Yeah.

607
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,118
We're running low on water.

608
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,855
Seven cans of sardines.

609
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:56,296
Nine cans...

610
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,099
of God knows what.

611
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:03,667
Let's pray for peaches.

612
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:06,173
Fortunately, I think
it's gonna be beans.

613
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,875
Three cans of Spam.

614
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,179
Ugh.

615
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:19,950
Thank God,
the bloody hot sauce

616
00:55:19,952 --> 00:55:21,152
didn't break though.

617
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,755
This isn't gonna
last us a week.

618
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:24,824
Well...

619
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:29,296
We can supplement
with protein.

620
00:55:32,065 --> 00:55:33,398
I'm not doing that.

621
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,599
- I'm not gonna kill any fish.
- Why not?

622
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:37,801
'Cause I'm not gonna
make something suffer.

623
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:39,703
That food's not gonna
last us till Hawaii.

624
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:40,940
I know it's not.

625
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,510
Sorry.

626
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,814
My ribs are broken,

627
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:51,485
my leg is shattered.

628
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,222
I'm dead weight.

629
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:26,418
Just relax.

630
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,853
Easy for you to say.

631
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:31,291
All right, well, remember
it could be worse.

632
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,460
Could die of hunger.

633
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,952
I can't do it.

634
00:57:01,954 --> 00:57:02,922
It's too hard.

635
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,395
It's okay.

636
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:15,535
I can't do it.

637
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,694
What you got
hiding in here?

638
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:28,841
What?

639
00:58:37,716 --> 00:58:40,353
No way. We've struck gold.

640
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:45,958
Are you kidding me right now?

641
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:52,399
We're gonna have a party!

642
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:57,870
A little touch of humanity...

643
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:30,437
<i>Well, I turn around
to look at you</i>

644
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:35,342
<i>Light a cigarette</i>

645
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:40,380
<i>I wish I had the guts
to bum one</i>

646
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:45,882
<i>You don't know me yet</i>

647
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:50,390
<i>And I hope that
I don't fall in love with you</i>

648
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,298
<i>'Cause falling in love
just makes me blue</i>

649
00:59:59,532 --> 01:00:02,369
<i>Well, the music plays</i>

650
01:00:03,503 --> 01:00:10,377
<i>And you display your heart
for me to see</i>

651
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:13,313
I wish you'd never met me...

652
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:19,818
So you wouldn't be
in this mess.

653
01:00:24,189 --> 01:00:26,859
But I wouldn't have us
to remember.

654
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:33,165
I wouldn't trade this
for anything.

655
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:47,844
<i>'Cause falling in love</i>

656
01:00:47,846 --> 01:00:49,783
<i>Just makes me blue</i>

657
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:56,019
<i>I had a beer and now I hear</i>

658
01:00:56,021 --> 01:01:01,060
<i>You calling out for me</i>

659
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:07,367
<i>Well, I think that I just</i>

660
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:14,374
<i>Fell in love with you</i>

661
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:19,644
Come on.

662
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:22,314
Hey, babe,
can I ask you something?

663
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:24,417
Sure.

664
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:26,386
How did your mum die?

665
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:31,689
Uh, you really want to know?

666
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:33,323
You don't have to tell me.

667
01:01:33,325 --> 01:01:34,960
Just... Curious.

668
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:39,566
When I was seven,
she hung herself.

669
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,401
What?

670
01:01:41,967 --> 01:01:43,668
Yeah, it... It's fine.

671
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,970
It's...

672
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:48,071
It's years ago now. So...

673
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:49,376
Wow, I'm so sorry.

674
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:54,445
But, Christ,
the first person in your life

675
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:56,913
who dies is supposed
to be old, you know?

676
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:58,418
Not your bloody mother.

677
01:02:02,087 --> 01:02:04,888
Uh, I think what I've done

678
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:06,593
over the years
is just sort of...

679
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:09,462
Sort of internalized.

680
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,598
What? Internalized what?

681
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,301
Her voice, I guess.

682
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:17,769
Yeah.

683
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:20,370
Like, in my mind, I still...

684
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:22,475
I still ask her
to take a look at things.

685
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:26,943
And still listen to her
tell me

686
01:02:26,945 --> 01:02:29,747
if something is right
or wrong, or...

687
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,350
What is she saying now?

688
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:34,987
Uh...

689
01:02:37,356 --> 01:02:39,891
"So it's true
what they say, innit?

690
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:43,128
"All men really do
wanna marry their mums."

691
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:50,934
Oh, fuck, did I just ask you
to marry me

692
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:52,906
in the voice
of my dead mother?

693
01:02:53,506 --> 01:02:55,207
Oh, God.

694
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,612
Okay, let me...

695
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:03,081
Let me try that one more time.

696
01:03:13,258 --> 01:03:14,393
I love you.

697
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:17,327
Mmm-hmm...

698
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:20,332
And I know that
I wanna be with you forever.

699
01:03:24,436 --> 01:03:26,171
So, uh...

700
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:29,943
Oh, my God.

701
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:35,380
Will you please marry me?

702
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,182
You're not supposed
to say "please."

703
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:41,253
You make it sound like
it's a favor.

704
01:03:42,054 --> 01:03:43,788
Right. Uh... Okay.

705
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,890
But yes, yes.

706
01:03:45,892 --> 01:03:47,660
- Should I...
- Of course.

707
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:53,363
Sorry. I must have made it
too small.

708
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:55,167
- Is that... Is that all right?
- Did you make this?

709
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:56,634
Yes, well...

710
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:59,269
But I promise when we get back
to the States,

711
01:03:59,271 --> 01:04:01,240
we can get you a real one.

712
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:02,575
No.

713
01:04:05,645 --> 01:04:06,746
It's perfect.

714
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:35,073
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

715
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:37,442
Hey!

716
01:04:39,646 --> 01:04:40,647
Hello!

717
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:46,285
Hey!

718
01:04:49,454 --> 01:04:50,557
I'm right here!

719
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,028
Stop! Hello!

720
01:04:55,628 --> 01:04:57,129
No. No...

721
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,164
No! No!

722
01:05:09,107 --> 01:05:10,710
No, no, no...

723
01:05:12,277 --> 01:05:16,047
How could you not see us?
We're right here!

724
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:17,684
We're right here!

725
01:05:20,185 --> 01:05:21,752
Where did you go?

726
01:05:24,222 --> 01:05:25,692
Where did you go?

727
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,329
I'm hallucinating?

728
01:05:31,196 --> 01:05:34,097
Am I hallucinating?

729
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:36,734
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die out here!

730
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:38,705
We're gonna die out here!

731
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:42,675
We might.

732
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,311
You're not supposed
to say that!

733
01:05:47,145 --> 01:05:48,411
You'd rather I lied to you?

734
01:05:48,413 --> 01:05:50,413
Yes, please lie to me.

735
01:05:50,415 --> 01:05:53,350
Just tell me
it's gonna be okay.

736
01:05:53,352 --> 01:05:55,220
Tell me that this is real.

737
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:57,824
What does that even mean?

738
01:06:06,866 --> 01:06:08,735
We're probably dead already.

739
01:06:10,535 --> 01:06:13,505
Exhausted...
Dehydrated...

740
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:16,541
Delirious, uh...

741
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:22,212
Yeah. But you're not dead.

742
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:05,321
Okay. Wake up.

743
01:07:05,323 --> 01:07:08,326
Baby, you've got to drink
some water. Open.

744
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:15,833
- More. One more.
- Uh-uh.

745
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:16,836
Come on.

746
01:07:18,336 --> 01:07:20,303
You have to eat something too.

747
01:07:20,305 --> 01:07:22,472
It's more important
you have it.

748
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:25,277
There's plenty for me.

749
01:07:25,845 --> 01:07:27,212
Open.

750
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:29,614
Dammit, take a bite.

751
01:07:30,415 --> 01:07:32,250
You have to eat something.

752
01:07:39,624 --> 01:07:42,492
You let me sleep
through the night again?

753
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:43,462
Yeah.

754
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:45,898
And another night.

755
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,601
And another day.

756
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:54,774
Just wake me up
when we get to Hawaii.

757
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,941
Guess what?

758
01:07:56,943 --> 01:08:00,477
We only have 690 miles to go.

759
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:02,581
Only?

760
01:08:03,149 --> 01:08:04,817
Yeah, only, baby.

761
01:08:07,053 --> 01:08:09,488
No, no. Stay awake.
Look at me.

762
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:13,558
Look... Look, look, look...

763
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:17,596
I'm the...

764
01:08:19,397 --> 01:08:21,633
I'm the one
who crosses the horizon.

765
01:08:25,204 --> 01:08:26,939
I'm a real sailor!

766
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:43,856
Whoa!

767
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:46,623
What was that?

768
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,928
Babe, you've got to come
see this!

769
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:57,034
Is that a land bird?

770
01:08:57,036 --> 01:08:58,869
Yeah.

771
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:01,437
What's it doing
this far from shore?

772
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,540
I don't know. The wind
must have blown her in.

773
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:04,977
All the way from land?

774
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:07,280
I think so.

775
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:11,050
It's remarkable, right?

776
01:09:19,357 --> 01:09:21,294
Should we be worried?

777
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:26,032
Hey, take the wheel,
I've just got to check this.

778
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:32,837
<i>A warning
to those in the Pacific.</i>

779
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,470
<i>High winds
and expected rainfall</i>

780
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:36,539
<i>are now changed to
a tropical depression</i>

781
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,942
<i>forming off Central America,</i>

782
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:40,010
<i>and is now
classified as a Class 4.</i>

783
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:42,645
<i>It's moving quickly
and increasing in strength,</i>

784
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:45,715
<i>currently at 12 degrees north
and 107 degrees</i>

785
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:47,184
<i>and moving west at 12 knots.</i>

786
01:09:47,186 --> 01:09:48,953
Babe, that's not good...

787
01:09:48,955 --> 01:09:51,721
<i>And a repeat, for those of you
just tuning in.</i>

788
01:09:51,723 --> 01:09:53,926
- Babe?
- Just one sec, please.

789
01:09:56,329 --> 01:10:00,463
Right, so we're at 11 north
and 123 west.

790
01:10:00,465 --> 01:10:02,233
That's well over
1,000 miles away

791
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:03,833
from the center of the storm.

792
01:10:03,835 --> 01:10:06,605
It should die out
before it reaches us, but...

793
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,173
We have to watch this one.

794
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:11,041
What if we just alter
our course?

795
01:10:11,043 --> 01:10:11,944
Huh?

796
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,311
We cut north,
give the storm a wider berth.

797
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:15,847
What do you think of that?

798
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:24,556
You're right, let's do it.

799
01:10:26,025 --> 01:10:28,725
We need to make sure
everything is secure.

800
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,361
Yeah, we need to tack first.

801
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:32,098
All right, let's tack.

802
01:10:45,177 --> 01:10:47,477
- All right, lock it up.
- Yep.

803
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:48,711
We don't want
any stuff flying around

804
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:50,515
in case the storm hits.

805
01:11:00,192 --> 01:11:01,726
Hey, I'll get that.

806
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,679
Look at that. Wake up.

807
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:23,015
What do you make of that?

808
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:28,753
It's pink absinthe.

809
01:11:31,923 --> 01:11:33,023
Hmm.

810
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:38,162
And bloody marigolds
in Hawaiian reduction.

811
01:11:38,164 --> 01:11:39,997
It's red.

812
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:42,532
- Did you just say "red"?
- Mmm.

813
01:11:42,534 --> 01:11:44,901
You coming round to my side?

814
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:47,237
Tami, it's red.

815
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:50,076
It is. Finally.

816
01:11:51,077 --> 01:11:53,609
It's red. It's red...

817
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:56,082
Red sky in the morning...

818
01:11:58,284 --> 01:12:00,086
Sailors take warning...

819
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:04,522
Another fricking storm?

820
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:33,585
Hey, babe.

821
01:12:35,187 --> 01:12:36,487
Oh, my God.

822
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:38,790
Oh, Christ, you're burning up.

823
01:12:40,092 --> 01:12:41,793
It's gonna be okay.

824
01:12:42,827 --> 01:12:45,730
I'm gonna build a shelter
for the storm.

825
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:50,802
Okay? Okay.

826
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:07,719
Let the sheet go!

827
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:11,355
What?

828
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:13,125
Let the sheet off now!

829
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:15,127
Okay.

830
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:40,852
Help! Take the halyard off!

831
01:13:49,395 --> 01:13:50,595
It's released!

832
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,231
Help me!

833
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:07,113
It was just a squall.

834
01:14:08,414 --> 01:14:10,380
It's amazing, isn't it?

835
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:11,747
How just a little sheet
can make

836
01:14:11,749 --> 01:14:14,186
the whole world
feel like it disappears?

837
01:14:16,054 --> 01:14:18,324
Do you see?

838
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:24,829
When I was little,

839
01:14:25,964 --> 01:14:30,167
my dad used to come visit
at my grandparents' house.

840
01:14:30,169 --> 01:14:32,336
We never knew
when he was coming,

841
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:34,070
he would just show up.

842
01:14:34,072 --> 01:14:36,975
When he arrived,
I would get so excited

843
01:14:37,775 --> 01:14:39,576
because he was
my favorite person

844
01:14:39,578 --> 01:14:41,147
in the whole world.

845
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,917
He would take me surfing
and get me ice cream and...

846
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:53,656
The next morning,
he would always be gone.

847
01:14:53,658 --> 01:14:54,757
We never knew
where he was going,

848
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:56,362
he would just disappear.

849
01:14:59,731 --> 01:15:02,100
And then starting
when I was about ten,

850
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:07,404
my grandparents
stopped letting him in

851
01:15:07,406 --> 01:15:09,206
when he would show up.

852
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,976
And he would just fly
into a rage.

853
01:15:13,978 --> 01:15:16,215
Screaming and shouting and...

854
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,081
I heard a lot of things

855
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:21,853
that most young girls
never have to hear.

856
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:31,361
But when it was happening,

857
01:15:31,363 --> 01:15:34,130
I would go into the bathroom,

858
01:15:34,132 --> 01:15:37,833
I would lock the door
and get in the bathtub,

859
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:41,906
and I'd put a blanket
over the shower rod,

860
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,173
and I'd pretend like

861
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:47,244
I was anywhere else
in the whole world.

862
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:55,987
We could do that right now.

863
01:15:57,889 --> 01:16:00,292
We could pretend
we were somewhere else.

864
01:16:04,729 --> 01:16:05,928
<i>Hurricane Raymond</i>

865
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,264
<i>is now classified
as a Category 4...</i>

866
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:08,367
Mayday! Mayday!

867
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,033
This is the sailing yacht
<i>Hazana.</i> Do you copy?

868
01:16:11,035 --> 01:16:12,971
We need to head southwest!

869
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:15,972
Are you sure?

870
01:16:15,974 --> 01:16:18,776
If we can't get above it,
maybe we can sneak below it!

871
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:21,779
What did you say?

872
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:23,781
Nothing. Just...

873
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:27,151
Just get the EPIRBs.

874
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:01,353
I love you.

875
01:17:28,747 --> 01:17:30,516
Do you want me to go?

876
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,716
I got it!

877
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,052
Be careful!

878
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,380
Hold on! Hold on!

879
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:38,347
- I've got you!
- Richard! Richard!

880
01:18:38,349 --> 01:18:40,386
It's all right!
It's all right.

881
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:45,655
Are you okay?

882
01:18:45,657 --> 01:18:47,391
Yeah. Yeah.

883
01:18:47,393 --> 01:18:49,258
I thought I'd
lost you there for a minute.

884
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,629
You're not gonna
lose me.

885
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,230
Now, get below.
It's safer.

886
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:56,966
I'm not going down
without you!

887
01:18:56,968 --> 01:18:58,869
We could roll!

888
01:18:58,871 --> 01:19:01,505
The boat will right itself.
Get below!

889
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:02,572
I'm not leaving you!

890
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:03,675
Get below now!

891
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:09,078
Oh, my God!

892
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,115
Tam, get in now!

893
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,184
You need to get in. Go!

894
01:19:15,186 --> 01:19:18,557
Here... Here...
Put your safety harness on!

895
01:20:15,012 --> 01:20:16,582
Tam...

896
01:20:22,955 --> 01:20:24,422
Tami...

897
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,559
Get up.

898
01:20:31,295 --> 01:20:32,330
Now.

899
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:37,101
Richard...

900
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:45,811
I'm gonna let you go now.

901
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:04,195
I'll love you forever.

902
01:22:10,294 --> 01:22:13,464
<i>And after a few days,
there's the hallucinations.</i>

903
01:22:27,278 --> 01:22:29,580
Are you ready to love me
even more?

904
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:43,760
<i>If I hadn't met you,</i>

905
01:22:43,762 --> 01:22:46,798
then I wouldn't have us
to remember.

906
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:51,168
I wouldn't trade this
for anything.

907
01:23:07,518 --> 01:23:09,855
I have to do this
on my own now.

908
01:24:32,738 --> 01:24:33,939
Hi.

909
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:36,540
