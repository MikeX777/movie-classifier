00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,241
REPORTED MISSING

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,811
Hello.

5
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,131
Insert your hands,

6
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,327
One.
Please turn around.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,204
Position your hands.

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,404
One.
Thank you.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,045
No contamination.

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,970
Please walk through.

11
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,201
Want a ride?

12
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,449
What?
- Want to come along?

13
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,168
Okay.
- Get in.

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,330
Where are you going?
- Down this way.

15
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Can you let me out up there?
- The town's ten kilometres away.

16
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,283
But I want to get out here.

17
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,604
It'll be dark soon...
- Would you let me out?

18
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,131
Fine.

19
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,971
Bye.

20
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,522
Hello.
- Hello.

21
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,923
How are you?
- Well.

22
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,765
Yes?

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,490
What, you?

24
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,124
She's not with me, no.
Why should she be?

25
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,411
One moment.

26
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,451
Excuse me.

27
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,529
She doesn't know me at all.

28
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,364
Oh please!
She was six.

29
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,321
She doesn't even have my address.

30
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,962
It's not my business any more.

31
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,650
You wanted Martha for yourself,
so cope with this on your own.

32
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,845
Who was that?

33
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,330
Sylvia.

34
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,931
What did she want?

35
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,330
HEY, what's up?

36
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,001
I don't know,
a friend of hers...

37
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,646
you know,
didn't come back from holiday.

38
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,650
So why's she calling you?
- Don't ask me.

39
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,407
Why do you gel so mad?
- She still drives me crazy.

40
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,807
Excluded the examination
of individual units

41
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,765
that might easily
have been disruptive.

42
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,771
The same is true of alert provisions.

43
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,047
The testing procedure protocol
complements the test protocol...

44
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,765
with its analogous...

45
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,685
readings...

46
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,485
The testing procedure protocol
also furnishes indices.

47
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,169
The reactors were tested
for system alert functions,

48
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,811
which...

49
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,164
Papa.
Did I wake you?

50
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,565
Is it Monday again?

51
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,849
No. I was just in the area.

52
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,525
Is Mama all right?

53
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,050
Why doesn't she visit?

54
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,804
Go back to sleep.
I didn't want to wake you.

55
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,768
For the activation
of electric subsystems

56
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,363
<i>regardless of lock-down conditions
and unit alert signals...</i>

57
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,211
Hello?

58
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,928
Oh, it's you.
- I forgot my key.

59
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,761
Were you expecting someone else?

60
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,761
I did some shopping.
Shall I cook?

61
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,005
Great.

62
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,005
Here.

63
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,125
One like this.

64
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,771
And a pair of jeans.

65
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,882
She's about this tall.

66
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,611
Hair this long.

67
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,488
Her figure is a bit like mine.

68
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,004
Hands like yours.

69
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,691
What are her interests?

70
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,888
Sport clubs? A music group?

71
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,244
She rides occasionally.

72
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,884
Did you call the stables?
- Yes. Of course.

73
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,561
A diary?

74
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,369
They write online.

75
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,484
Blogs and so on.

76
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,723
Did you check the computer?

77
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,363
I don't have the passwords.

78
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,482
Thanks.

79
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,042
You've been so weird recently.

80
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Really?
- Well...

81
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,241
Is something up at work?
- No.

82
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,366
Or is it because Sylvia called again?

83
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,849
She didn't call again.
- She'd called about a friend.

84
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,724
That got cleared up.

85
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,168
You said she didn't call again.

86
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,006
She didn't.
She sent a text message.

87
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,289
There is no friend, right?

88
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,725
Tell me what's up.

89
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,805
I have a daughter.

90
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,691
With Sylvia.

91
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,001
What?

92
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,361
She's thirteen.

93
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,402
I wanted to put it all behind me.

94
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,688
To finish with it. For us, too.

95
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,485
For us?

96
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,125
Yes. I...

97
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,524
I wanted to start over.

98
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,891
Why...

99
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,451
Why what?

100
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,809
Didn't you ask yourself

101
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,884
if I'd have been glad
about this daughter?

102
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,121
Vera,

103
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,004
you don't know Sylvia.

104
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,922
Why are you telling me this now?

105
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,729
Because she's vanished.

106
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,731
Julia!
Do you have a moment?

107
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,761
This is Mr Meinert, Martha's father.

108
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,086
Hello.

109
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,726
You...

110
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,724
are a friend of Martha's?

111
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,410
I'll leave you alone.

112
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,285
If you need me,
I'll be in the staff room.

113
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,250
Thanks.

114
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,723
Did Martha give any hint
of where she's gone to?

115
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,811
No.

116
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,405
Do you have any idea

117
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,731
where she might be?

118
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,771
Nope.

119
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,886
It'd be a relief to us
to know she's well.

120
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,128
If she went away voluntarily.

121
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,164
We want nothing from her.

122
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
You understand?

123
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,771
Who is "we"?

124
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,481
Her mother and I.

125
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,490
I thought
you didn't talk to each other.

126
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,446
We do, now.

127
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,728
Now that Martha's gone?
- Yes.

128
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,811
Was that it?

129
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,931
Yes.

130
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,851
Thanks.

131
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,085
Well?

132
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,041
Did you know a schoolmate of Martha's
is missing, too?

133
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,163
A boy from an asocial family.

134
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,291
The parents said nothing

135
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,131
till the school asked
where the boy is.

136
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,204
So that's fine, then?

137
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,482
And did you speak to that Julia?

138
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,650
Yes, of course.
- And did you find it normal?

139
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,564
What do you mean, normal?

140
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,043
She doesn't give a shit
that her best friend disappeared.

141
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,208
And how would you know that?

142
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,369
It leaves her cold as ice.

143
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,248
I took this one for the poster.

144
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,851
Did you see it?

145
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,328
There aren't many recent ones.
She's camera-shy.

146
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,967
Here. Bornholm.

147
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,891
She was so small.

148
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,442
If I'd taken more care of her...

149
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,611
You couldn't have followed her around.

150
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,608
She wouldn't have just left.

151
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,201
She would have said something.

152
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,121
Maybe she's long dead now.

153
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,486
You think it's normal
that children just vanish?

154
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,081
It's not as unusual
as you might think.

155
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,327
Oh, no?

156
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,602
90 percent of all missing people
are teenagers.

157
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,929
80 percent of them turn up in the end.

158
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,561
What about the other 20 percent?

159
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,528
I understand your concerns.

160
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,051
I'm a father myself.

161
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,969
You have my telephone number.

162
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,207
Good bye.
- Good bye.

163
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,688
2005 friends!
How can that be?

164
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,603
She doesn't know them all.

165
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,042
What does it mean, Martha
is a member of the?ying rats group"?

166
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,810
That she's a member.

167
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,528
Can you click for more info?

168
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,084
There's nothing going on.

169
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,725
What does the rat mean?

170
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,369
Nothing. it's just a logo.

171
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,370
What kind of group is it?

172
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,322
We make dates and have parties.

173
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,845
What kind of parties?

174
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,682
We post bottles of beer.

175
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,689
Not real beer, of course.

176
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,523
You realise Martha's vanished,
that she might be dead?

177
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,291
You're the one asking the questions.

178
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,522
MISSING
MARTHA MEINERT

179
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,811
Hello?
- My name is Meinert, I...

180
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
I'm the father of a girl
at your son's school.

181
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,886
I'd like to talk to you.

182
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,243
My daughter recently vanished...
- Don't bother me.

183
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,805
Hello?

184
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,285
Yes?

185
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,364
My name's Meinert,
I'd like to talk to you.

186
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,289
My daughter has also vanished.

187
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,086
Like your son.
I share your troubles.

188
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,484
I only want to talk to you!

189
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,804
Do you have news from your son?
Anything?

190
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,368
I only want to exchange information,
that's all.

191
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,444
That must be possible.

192
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,762
That must be possible!

193
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,209
Hey, a new cell phone...

194
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,568
Listen to what it says here:

195
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,687
"The number of missing teenagers
has risen recently.

196
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,609
In comparison to recent years,

197
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,525
the number has risen
by a clear margin.

198
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,564
Police Inspector Heine claims
it is due to the time of year...

199
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,881
It's in the miscellaneous news.

200
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,886
Well, what do you say?

201
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,044
Don't they have school?

202
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,650
Do they always meet there?
- I've no idea.

203
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,520
I gave one of them a ride, recently.

204
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,922
Strange coincidence, isn't it?

205
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,406
Did you see the picture with the rat?

206
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,966
What rat?

207
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,645
A rat with wings.

208
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,811
I don't know, Lothar.

209
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,362
What am I to do about them?

210
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
I've no time for other children now.

211
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,889
I think you don't want to know
what's happened.

212
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,402
Because I don't watch teenagers
out the window?

213
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,370
Why did you call me, then?

214
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,847
I thought Martha maybe at yours.

215
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,450
I thought she can't stand me.

216
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,689
Says who?
- You did, if I'm not mistaken.

217
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,121
That's seven years ago.

218
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,086
Exactly. Seven years,
during which I never saw Martha.

219
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,730
Because you just left.

220
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,083
Because you wouldn't let me see her.
- Rubbish.

221
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,289
You never took responsibility.

222
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,089
You still think
the world turns around you.

223
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,926
Now Martha's vanished and what counts
are your feelings.

224
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,361
You're disgusting.

225
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,844
Hey!
- What the hell!

226
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,408
What are you doing out at this time?
- Let go of me.

227
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,766
Get in!

228
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,161
What was that?
- A stone, I think.

229
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,641
Where have you been? It's 10:20!

230
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,171
Good evening.

231
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,042
Is something wrong?
- Your daughter missed the bus.

232
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,846
I drove her home.

233
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,010
What bus?
- Evening.

234
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,322
What's wrong with your bike?

235
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,851
It's got a flat.

236
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,763
You can't come and go at will.

237
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,371
We had an agreement.

238
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,968
I'm off to bed.
I start early tomorrow.

239
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,123
Say thanks at least.
- Thanks.

240
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,526
Any time.

241
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,365
Won't you come in?

242
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,764
I have to go home.
Take good care of her.

243
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,009
What are you doing there?

244
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,251
Did I wake you?

245
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,605
No. I need the loo.

246
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,129
What are you doing there?

247
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,850
They smashed my window.

248
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,441
Hello.

249
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,047
Oh, it's you.
- Is your daughter there?

250
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,083
No. She's still at school.

251
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,765
Would you call there?

252
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,120
Why should I?

253
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,966
Because I don't think she's there.

254
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,407
I don't know what I make of you.

255
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,489
Do you know your daughter
wanders the country during the day?

256
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,325
I think that's none of your business.

257
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,370
No one asked you to keep coming here.
Leave us in peace.

258
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,004
Hey! Stop there!

259
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,411
Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,411
A coffee, please.

261
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,971
Was that a break-in?

262
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,485
The second this week.

263
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,041
Oh yes?

264
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,921
Two girls.

265
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,522
They broke the window,
got in, and off they went.

266
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,645
Did you see the girls?

267
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,331
It wasn't my shift.

268
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,405
They were 13, 14, I hear.

269
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,965
That's all.

270
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,891
What did they steal?

271
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,166
Petty stuff.
Food, crisps, the like.

272
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,169
Oh, crap.

273
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,490
What?
- Can we come in?

274
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,970
What?
- Can we?

275
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,806
Yes.

276
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,087
Hi.
- Hi.

277
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,726
Hello.
One of you can sit in the front.

278
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,484
What brought you here?

279
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,011
We got caught in the rain.

280
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,567
I see that.

281
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,291
Want some?

282
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,201
Yes.

283
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,571
Okay?

284
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,765
It's all right.

285
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,244
And what are you doing here?
- Me?

286
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,371
Yes.

287
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,970
I got caught up in the rain, too.

288
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,723
I'm travelling for work.
I'm an engineer.

289
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,126
For reactor safety.

290
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,084
Atomic reactors?
- Yes.

291
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,283
I check the power stations.

292
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,602
And the waste
just goes on the dump?

293
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,846
The dump?

294
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,766
It's buried
in radiation-proof containers.

295
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,921
You don't believe that yourself.

296
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,846
I'm no promoter of atomic energy.
I just check the security.

297
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,771
Everything okay?

298
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,010
Safety's brainwashing, too.

299
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,483
People like
their standards of living.

300
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,441
This requires energy.
And the population is large.

301
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,803
There are other solutions.

302
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,731
Yes? Like what?

303
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,647
Like killing everyone over sixty.

304
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,329
Isn't that a bit drastic?

305
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,491
Why?

306
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,963
And does that go for your parents?

307
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,324
Sure.

308
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,567
Then my time would be up
in a few years.

309
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,804
Hello! Hello! Hey!

310
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,162
Did you see three teenagers?

311
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,483
Two boys and a girl?

312
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,765
Yes. Right.
- It was a while back.

313
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,691
Where did they go?
- That way.

314
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,691
Martha!

315
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,251
Martha!

316
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,451
Want to ride along?

317
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,887
Sorry?
- Can I give you a ride?

318
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,929
I've no money.
- It's okay.

319
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,005
Spicy?

320
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,287
Yes, please.

321
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,925
GO AND FETCH
YOUR CHILDREN HOME

322
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,884
Here you are.

323
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,726
Thanks.

324
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,160
I've no money.

325
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,887
Give it back if you can't pay.

326
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,767
I'll bring you the money.
I just have to go to the bank.

327
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,962
Give it back. Hey! Stop there!

328
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,160
What are you doing here?

329
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,408
What?
- What are you doing here?

330
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,325
The door was open.

331
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,569
No reason to snoop around.

332
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,810
Is today the weekend?

333
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,811
No, it is not.

334
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,321
Hello?

335
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,924
Can I have my laundry done?

336
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,406
Yes, please.

337
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,926
Thanks.

338
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,764
What brought you here?

339
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,167
Chance.
I'm looking for someone.

340
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,445
We all are.

341
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,489
I'm looking for my child.

342
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,328
He was among a group that they

343
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,170
found in the woods.

344
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,722
I was so glad when the call came.

345
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,164
Now they won't let him go.

346
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,161
Why not?

347
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,405
They're afraid
they'll all run off again

348
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,841
as soon as they're brought back.

349
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,931
They don't...

350
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,161
have the situation under control.

351
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,125
Someone told me they're lodging
children in a refugee home.

352
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,484
There are too many of them.

353
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,204
If you get your son back,
what will you do?

354
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,810
We'll drive home.

355
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,849
And if he runs away again?

356
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,685
I don't know.

357
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,922
Maybe we have to just let them be.

358
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,164
Would you like to dance?

359
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,844
Sorry?
- Will you dance?

360
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,803
I haven't danced in years.

361
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,366
Nor have I.

362
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,051
Come along.

363
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,844
Come along.

364
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,845
Have you seen a boy?

365
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,451
What?
- A boy.

366
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,845
I don't think so.
- It's your duty to say so if you have.

367
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,125
But I've seen no one.

368
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,646
Can I see your ID?

369
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,046
Of course.

370
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,724
Is anything wrong?

371
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,331
It's routine.

372
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,924
Do you know
you've been reported missing?

373
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,761
Excuse me?
- Your wife filed it.

374
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,731
Vera Meinert.

375
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,126
My God!

376
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,806
We have to inform her
you're no longer considered missing.

377
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,207
Shall we tell her where you are?

378
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,091
No.

379
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,366
What is the reason for your stay here?

380
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,491
Private reasons. I'm taking time out.

381
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,605
Hey, get off me.

382
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,888
I've done nothing. Let me go.

383
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,527
Ease up now.
- Stay where you are.

384
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,604
Loosen your grip.
All right?

385
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,600
What do you want from my daughter?
Hold you to stick by me.

386
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,086
Hungry?

387
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,008
Where are you all going to?

388
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,683
Do you have a place to stay?

389
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,004
The majority of these children
comes from proper families.

390
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,886
What are your plans?

391
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,010
Vigilante groups are springing up
in some areas

392
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,330
to protect the citizens
from theft and other...

393
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,530
Are you opening a kindergarten?
- No, not yet.

394
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,809
Do you have a leader?

395
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,846
Did someone order you to come here?

396
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,771
Which is the promised land, then,
Mr Glasner?

397
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,322
We don '1 know
what these young people are planning.

398
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,808
They are 16 and less,
they're growing steadily younger.

399
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,287
Anything else?
- They are parasites.

400
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,482
No, thanks.
- Then here's the bill.

401
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,130
18.20, please.

402
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,683
We are being confronted
with a new form of migration.

403
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,843
Is "migration" even the word for it?

404
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,683
My daughter lives in the house
you hang around in front of.

405
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,325
You might know her.

406
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,450
Her name's Martha.

407
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,805
Martha Meinert.

408
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,720
You must know her.
You were standing outside her house.

409
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,040
Whose house?
- My daughter Martha's.

410
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,130
I don't think so.

411
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,525
She's around 1.60,

412
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,281
mid-length brown hair,

413
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,971
thin.

414
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,642
She goes to Silberkamp School.

415
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,841
Hello.

416
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,731
I wanted to ask if everything's okay.

417
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,408
Yes, everything's fine, thanks.

418
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,843
You found your daughter.
- No, not yet.

419
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,651
Who is that?
- A friend of my daughter's.

420
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,211
What do you mean?

421
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,642
We happened to cross paths.

422
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,764
What's wrong with you?

423
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,202
Who's that girl in your room?

424
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,970
Lou, wake up.
- What's up?

425
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,087
We have to go.

426
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,162
Do something.
Call the police.

427
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,091
Who is the girl?

428
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,882
I don't know.
- What age?

429
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,682
Eleven, twelve. I don't know.

430
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,886
Short, dark hair.

431
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,924
Why did you run away?

432
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,801
I didn't like it anymore.

433
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,970
You treat life
as if it were inexpendable.

434
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,691
Better than being expended yourself.

435
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,971
Wait.

436
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,730
Here.

437
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,890
Where did you get that?

438
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,964
From the supermarket.

439
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,565
Want some?

440
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,644
What's it like to get old?

441
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,723
I'm not actually that old.

442
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,524
No. But...

443
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,164
you're older, anyway.

444
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,565
What's there to say?

445
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,445
It just happens.

446
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,530
I don't want to get old.

447
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,084
Recognise any of them?

448
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,490
Not so far, no.

449
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,731
The militia!

450
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,850
What are you doing here?

451
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,567
What business is that of yours?
Who are you?

452
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,003
We have police powers.
Your papers, please.

453
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,088
Show me yours, first.
And those from the police.

454
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,801
Take your hands off my daughter.
Let go of me.

455
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,886
Everything okay?

456
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,967
We need a doctor. Call a doctor.

457
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,608
Stay quiet. Don't talk.

458
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,810
We'll call an ambulance
and drive you to hospital.

459
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,321
I want...
I still want to...

460
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,326
Yes, you will. You'll do so.

461
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,602
Why won't you call an ambulance?

462
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,689
Cut the old folk's balls off,
balls off, balls off...

463
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,645
Cut the old folk's balls off!
Dead! Dead! Dead!

464
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,562
Lou, please. I'm sorry.

465
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,125
Please don't...

466
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:08,328
for my parents and my daughter Cléo

467
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:09,327
