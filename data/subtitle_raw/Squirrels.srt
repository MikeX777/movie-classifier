1
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:04,655
(funky music)

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,060
- I first moved into this dump,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,493
excuse me, lovely apartment in June.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,010
It was a sweltering day.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,450
I love that word, sweltering,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,263
it kinda reminds me of
melting vanilla ice cream.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,310
The rent's $2975 a month,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,280
marked down from $3750.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,653
What a bargain!

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,323
Wait you're not actually
filming this are you?

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,360
I first moved into this dump,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,580
excuse me, lovely and
glamorous apartment in June.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,840
It was a sweltering day.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,040
The rent is $2975 a month,

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,770
marked down from $3750.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,350
What a bargain for all this luxury!

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,850
Notice how every
apartment in New York City

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,383
is a "luxury" apartment these days?

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,670
It's luxury or it's the streets,

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,590
nothing in between.

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,090
Finding an apartment is hard enough,

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,660
actually getting that apartment

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,590
is damn near impossible.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,590
You can't just pay first and
last and security deposit

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,650
and move in in New York anymore.

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,070
You have to make 40
times the rent in a year.

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,610
Which, for this dump,

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,390
excuse me, lovely, luxury apartment,

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,780
so intimate and convenient,

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,830
and such a prime location

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,760
in the heart of the East Village.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,276
You know, where all the artists live.

33
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,350
(laughing)

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,460
So much character, so much life.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,060
Vibrance, electric.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,090
For this lovely apartment, marked down

37
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,980
to the bargain basement price

38
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,550
of just $2975 a month.

39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,133
Multiply that by 40 and
you just have to make

40
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,940
$119,000 a year.

41
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah, that's not happening
being a part time DJ

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,200
and full time underground superstar.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
Luckily, I was able to find two cute

44
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,890
art students to move in with me.

45
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,370
We still can't afford it.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,800
We scrimp and save and scam

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,360
and steal our way from month to month.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,863
Somehow we survive.

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,040
How was that?

50
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,465
- It was good.

51
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:25,715
But try to be a little more

52
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,200
natural.

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,648
- Natural?

54
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:30,735
I'm done.

55
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,735
(funky drone music)

56
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,790
Guys!

57
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,703
The rent is due next week!

58
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,903
- Working on it.

59
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,570
(sighs)

60
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,153
(funky music)

61
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:23,110
- We have a potential Share
B&B person this weekend.

62
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,120
Should I accept?

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,790
- Yes!
- Okay.

64
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,640
It's your turn to be the hostess.

65
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,613
- Already?

66
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,273
- Yes.

67
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:39,442
Tarik.

68
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,204
It's your turn to be the...

69
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,030
- Worm!

70
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,501
(softly chuckles)

71
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,001
(funky music)

72
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:28,173
- C'mon we're gonna be
late for our classes.

73
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,006
Damn it!

74
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,011
(knocking)

75
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,302
- [Sparkle] Yeah?

76
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,263
- [Tarik] C'mon, Sparkle.

77
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,726
- [Sparkle] Just a second!

78
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,809
(groans)

79
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,812
- C'mon, let's go.

80
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:00,312
(funky music)

81
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:07,989
- [Man] Tarik, what have
you got for us today?

82
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,471
(sighs)

83
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,852
- My parents and I were
walking down the street.

84
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,010
We were in Miami, I can't remember why.

85
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,583
I was just a little boy.

86
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,340
It was just after 9/11.

87
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,003
We were getting looks.

88
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,450
Scared white women grabbed their children

89
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,410
and held them close,

90
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,800
as if we would explode at any moment,

91
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,150
as if holding them in their frail arms

92
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,543
would make any difference.

93
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,173
My mother was horrified.

94
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,360
She wanted to go back to the hotel.

95
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,473
My father refused.

96
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:55,773
I saw him smile.

97
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,530
My father never smiled.

98
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,830
But he was smiling now

99
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,273
as he walked defiantly down the street.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,700
He basked in the fear all around us.

101
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,760
Drunk with power, this sad, broken man

102
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,210
who had never so much as
cracked a smile in front of me,

103
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,613
he was smiling now.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700
And not just any smile.

105
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,493
a big shit eating grin.

106
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,393
My mother tried to pull me away from him.

107
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,493
My father reached down
and grabbed my hand.

108
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,450
My father never touched me,

109
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,600
not a pat on the head

110
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,920
or a slap across the face.

111
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,753
Nothing.

112
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,773
He was holding my hand now,

113
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,250
squeezing it tight as he
pulled me along with him.

114
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,933
His hand was strong,

115
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,463
calloused and rough,

116
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,273
dark, almost gray,

117
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,003
like elephant skin.

118
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,753
It felt good.

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,643
Damp and warm.

120
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,442
I wanted to curl up in
that hand and take a nap.

121
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,723
But he kept pulling me along.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,970
We were going somewhere in a hurry.

123
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,540
I had no idea where then

124
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,833
and I have no idea where now.

125
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,463
I saw two men walk out of a building.

126
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,730
They were handsome,

127
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,693
wearing brightly colored
shirts and shorts.

128
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,180
One was white with sun bleached hair,

129
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,613
the other was dark like my father.

130
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,920
They took hold of each other

131
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,113
and something inside of me stirred.

132
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:10,937
My heart started pounding
as if for the first time.

133
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,130
They were holding each other so close,

134
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,920
the white one reached down and grabbed

135
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,453
the dark one's ass
through his cut off jeans.

136
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,523
My heart was fluttering.

137
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,293
I felt like I was flying, leaving my body,

138
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,940
then my father reached
over with his other hand

139
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,933
and covered my face.

140
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,210
His hand was warmer and damper,

141
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,193
wet even, as if drenched in sweat.

142
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,923
I could feel the blood
pounding through it.

143
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,263
I could still see through the
cracks of my father's hand.

144
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,323
The two men kissed.

145
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,773
Burrowing their tongues
in each others mouths.

146
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,650
My father's hand held me tighter,

147
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,720
and I struggled to breathe.

148
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,260
I opened my mouth gasping for air

149
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,700
and I could taste the salty sweet sweat

150
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,213
now dripping from my father's hand.

151
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,377
"Faggots."

152
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,460
I heard him say, "Faggots."

153
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,473
So softly.

154
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:33,547
I could barely hear him.

155
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,510
As if he was practicing the line,

156
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,403
trying to remember what to say.

157
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,070
Then he said it again,
shouting it this time.

158
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:50,412
"Faggots!"

159
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,950
My mother grabbed me, pulling
me away from my father.

160
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,350
I took one deep breath
and looked up at the men.

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,413
The white one yelled back,

162
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:10,607
"Fuck off, Al Qaeda."

163
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,117
Then the dark one joined in,

164
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:18,187
"Takes one to know one sweetie."

165
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,313
I looked up at my father,
and his face was flush red.

166
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,193
His forehead now dripping
that salty sweet sweat.

167
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,853
I saw his lip tremble ever so slightly,

168
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,783
as he said, in a calm low voice,

169
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,243
"Every last one of them.

170
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,957
"The world won't be safe

171
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:52,497
"until every last one of them is dead."

172
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,094
(footsteps clacking)

173
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,783
It's 2016.

174
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,183
I am dancing at the club.

175
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,923
I've had a few drinks.

176
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,843
I'm having fun.

177
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,060
It's when I hear the first gun shot.

178
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,873
There is panic on the dance floor.

179
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,680
Everyone runs in every direction,

180
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,513
suddenly unaware of the location
of the entrances and exits.

181
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,953
I hear more gunshots.

182
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:50,630
They sound like they're
coming from all around me,

183
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,930
like a surround sound demonstration

184
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,823
before the trailers start in a movie.

185
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,503
I see a lit doorway,

186
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,323
and I run towards it.

187
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,723
I am in the restrooms.

188
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,503
The gender neutral rest rooms.

189
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,870
There is no way out and
the sound of the gun shots

190
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,523
is definitely getting closer.

191
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,713
I see an open stall, and I run towards it,

192
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
opening the flimsy door,

193
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,250
closing it behind me, and locking it.

194
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,433
I sit down on the broken toilet seat.

195
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,370
With every new gun shot,
a scream is silenced

196
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,263
until there is no more screaming.

197
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:57,684
I can hear Lady Gaga over
the sound system, hiccuping.

198
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,851
(humming)

199
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm not sure if it's
the latest dance remix

200
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,373
or if the track is skipping.

201
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,503
I hear more gun shots.

202
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,903
Closer now, just outside the restroom.

203
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,793
Then the door opens with a thud.

204
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,970
I pull my feet up off the
ground and onto the toilet seat.

205
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,223
Curl myself into a ball,

206
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,733
trying to make myself
as small as possible,

207
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,613
hoping that I will disappear.

208
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,690
The gunman is in the restroom now.

209
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,633
I hear a high pitched squeal,

210
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,750
then a deafening gunshot,

211
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,073
and then silence.

212
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,243
Then the gunman speaks.

213
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,267
"Every last one of them."

214
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,553
I recognize my father's voice immediately.

215
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,523
I hear his boots walk
up to my stall and stop.

216
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,957
He speaks again, louder this time,

217
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,020
"Every last one of them!"

218
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,310
He tries to open the door.

219
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,093
The lock holds but just barely.

220
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,843
There's no way out.

221
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,793
I take a deep breath.

222
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,770
I plant my feet on the ground

223
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,273
and sit up straight.

224
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,050
I wipe the tears off my cheeks

225
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,723
with the sleeve of my t-shirt.

226
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,550
He tries opening the door again,

227
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,010
shaking it violently,

228
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,403
grabbing it from above, and shaking it.

229
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,923
Miraculously the lock holds.

230
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,797
His voice is angry now, shouting,

231
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:16,147
"Every last one of them!"

232
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,633
I look at the door, and I am ready.

233
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,693
He kicks it, and it swings open.

234
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,243
He is in the stall now.

235
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,563
He sees me, recognizes me.

236
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,513
I see his mouth tremble ever so slightly.

237
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,757
I smile at him.

238
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,743
Tears are streaming down my face now.

239
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,453
His face hardens,

240
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,543
as he puts the barrel of
the gun to my forehead.

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,753
And he says in a soft, low voice,

242
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,833
"Every last one of them."

243
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,863
He pulls the trigger, and the gun clicks.

244
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,353
He is out of bullets.

245
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,947
He looks at me, as if
he's coming out of a daze,

246
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,093
and he smiles.

247
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,533
Right then,

248
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,190
just as I'm about to
comprehend that smile,

249
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,313
to understand the man behind it,

250
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,753
the other bullets come.

251
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,719
The police have finally arrived.

252
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,940
Hundreds of bullets scatter my father

253
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,863
all across that bathroom.

254
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,423
My father's final words,

255
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:16,743
"Every last one of them."

256
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,044
(light music)

257
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:30,877
- Hey.

258
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,704
- Hey.
- Come here.

259
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,030
I really liked your piece.

260
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,530
You know, your performance or whatever.

261
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,100
- Thanks.

262
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,933
- So.

263
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,443
Is it all true?

264
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,763
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

265
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,523
That's intense.

266
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,200
So, I'm a painting major,

267
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,953
and I would love to paint you.

268
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,200
(chuckles)

269
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,033
- Okay.

270
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,810
- I'm Slade, by the way.

271
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,270
- I know who you are.

272
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,839
- Really?

273
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,672
- [Tarik] We're in the same class.

274
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,813
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

275
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,813
So, would you like to get
a coffee or something?

276
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,500
- You already have a coffee.

277
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,793
- I can get another one.

278
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,450
- I'm actually waiting for someone, so.

279
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,673
- Oh, okay.
- I can't.

280
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,350
He's not really someone, you know?

281
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,773
He's just my roommate.

282
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,693
- Oh, good.

283
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,671
(funky music)

284
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:05,186
Well, congratulations,
again, on the piece.

285
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,990
- Thanks.

286
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,499
- [Slade] I guess I'll see you around.

287
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,999
(funky music)

288
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:34,063
- [Tarik] Hi!

289
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,646
- Hey.
- Thank you.

290
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,740
- What was that all about?

291
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,210
- [Tarik] What was what all about?

292
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,043
- Slade?

293
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,163
- Well, he really liked my piece.

294
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,133
- Oh, yeah?

295
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,450
(laughing)

296
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,263
How did your performance
spoken word thing go?

297
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,633
- Not great, but Slade really liked it.

298
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,043
- Well, that's something, I guess.

299
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,773
- I think he was just coming on to me.

300
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,980
- Well, he must have really liked it then.

301
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,482
- Since when is he gay?

302
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,010
- Oh, he just doesn't believe in labels.

303
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,363
He's an equal opportunity opportunist.

304
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,553
What kind of a name is Slade, anyway?

305
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,423
I mean, who or what does he think he is?

306
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,150
Painting majors can be so pretentious.

307
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,770
I hate them.

308
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,017
We hate them.

309
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:42,811
Don't we?

310
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:43,928
- Yes.

311
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:46,428
(light music)

312
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:04,424
- Well, this is it.

313
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,353
- Wow, it's huge.

314
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,230
- Really, you think so?

315
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,030
- You should see my place in
London, it's half the size.

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,420
- Yeah, well, you have the money?

317
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,983
- Yes, of course.

318
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:21,853
Okay, here it is.

319
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:23,544
- Great.

320
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,510
Well, it's all yours.

321
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,823
Make yourself at home.

322
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,560
And be careful with the toilet.

323
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,013
It's a bit wobbly.

324
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,060
And the shower is either
scalding hot or freezing.

325
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,110
The gas was shut off, we had a leak,

326
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,834
but at least you won't blow up.

327
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,667
(laughing)

328
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,003
- Okay, anything else?

329
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,533
- No, I think that's about it.

330
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:55,937
Yeah, I think that's it, okay.

331
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,320
Oh!
- Keys?

332
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,306
- Oh!

333
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:00,139
(laughing)

334
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,600
How could I forget that?
- Thank you!

335
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,980
- Yeah, I am DJing tonight,

336
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,100
around the corner at
The Cock on 2nd Avenue.

337
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,270
Stop by, and I'll buy you a drink.

338
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,180
- Oh, sounds fun, thanks.
- Bye!

339
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,280
- [Harry] Okay, I'll see
you later, I'll come.

340
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,640
Okay, goodnight, bye.

341
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,487
(snaps fingers)

342
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:30,987
(light music)

343
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:20,528
(techno club music)

344
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:13,239
(door clicking)

345
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:16,858
- [Tarik] Great place.

346
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:18,275
- [Harry] Thanks.

347
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,023
(smooching)

348
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:30,124
- Can I use your bathroom?

349
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:30,957
- Sure.

350
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,133
It's over there.

351
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,116
(rustling)

352
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,095
(sighs)

353
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:07,987
- One, two, three.

354
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,320
(clanking)

355
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:19,631
51, 52.

356
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:32,737
59.

357
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,964
(exhales)

358
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:00,256
(snaps fingers)

359
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,858
(rustling)

360
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:18,612
(groaning)

361
00:29:29,244 --> 00:29:31,244
(sighs)

362
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,286
(phone ringing)

363
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,316
(grunts)

364
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:40,441
(deep breathing)

365
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,941
(eerie music)

366
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,487
(water running)

367
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:19,151
(window scraping)

368
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,615
Don't give me that look.

369
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:27,115
(eerie music)

370
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:46,209
(grunts)

371
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,626
Good morning!

372
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,910
You were amazing last night.

373
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,750
- I was?

374
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,753
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,890
- Thank you.
- Sorry, I have to run.

376
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,923
- [Harry] Wait, can't you stay,

377
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:01,330
have some breakfast or something?

378
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,200
- No, sorry, I'm running late for work,

379
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,177
but I'll see you.

380
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,723
- Bye!

381
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,020
Wait, what's your name?

382
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:18,485
Amazing.

383
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:30,280
(light funky beat music)

384
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:22,335
(phone ringing)

385
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,456
(grunting)

386
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:36,927
Hello?

387
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:40,738
Yes, I'm fine.

388
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,970
(laughing)

389
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,963
Everything's fine.

390
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,640
Oh, the place is brilliant.

391
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,023
It's very quiet and cozy.

392
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,400
The hostess is very
friendly and accommodating.

393
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,620
It's New York, so everything is a little

394
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,020
rough around the edges

395
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,303
but in a charming way.

396
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,709
Oh and I met someone last night.

397
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,500
(laughing)

398
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,523
Yes.

399
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,610
I know.

400
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,753
Oh, don't say that.

401
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:17,020
Yes, my first night in New York,

402
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,670
and I've already shagged someone.

403
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,960
I don't want to brag or anything,

404
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,413
but apparently I was incredible.

405
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
Unfortunately I had quite a bit to drink,

406
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,390
so I don't actually remember any of it.

407
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,310
I went through quite a
bit of cash last night.

408
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,732
Don't say that, you're terrible.

409
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,436
(laughing)

410
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:45,722
I suppose things must be
awfully expensive here.

411
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:48,222
(funky music)

412
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,913
You really are a nasty
bitch, you know that?

413
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:58,802
Yes, you are, that's
why I love you, darling.

414
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,731
Oh, don't say that.

415
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:20,785
I miss you too, bye.

416
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,648
(funky music)

417
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:25,065

418
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:33,377

419
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:51,145
(shouting)

420
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,634
Son of a bitch!

421
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:55,134
(funky music)

422
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,031
- What's up with him?

423
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:08,140
- He's working on getting us a place

424
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,990
to crash tonight.

425
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:14,628
- We're in!

426
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:26,703

427
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,348
(knocking)

428
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,770
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, nice to see you.

429
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,567
- Welcome to my abode.

430
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,821
Who are you?

431
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:49,730
- I'm in your class, douche bag.

432
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,125
- Nice to meet you, douche bag.

433
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,669
Who are you, beautiful?

434
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,502
(sighs)

435
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:56,260
- What the hell kind of name is Slade?

436
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,810
- It's my name, what's yours?

437
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,320
- Sparkle.

438
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,153

Hi.

497
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,131
- Want a smoke?

498
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,329

- What do you do?

500
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:18,854
- Lots of other things.

501
00:43:18,854 --> 00:43:20,512
- That sounds interesting.

502
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:21,413
- Yeah.

503
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:24,013
What are you doing here in
the cold all by yourself?

504
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,793
- My girlfriend has a client over.

505
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,900
- I have a Share B&B guest in my place.

506
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,822
- It's that time of the month, huh?

507
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:34,657
- [Sparkle] Hm?

508
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:36,613
- Rent's due.
- Oh, yeah, right.

509
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,880
- With how much they keep raising it,

510
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,770
it won't be long until there
aren't any artists left

511
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,950
in this neighborhood at all.

512
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,898
- Yeah, there aren't that many
artists left as it is now.

513
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:53,977
- You're an artist, though, right?

514
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:57,821
- Yeah, I'm a DJ and performance artist.

515
00:43:57,821 --> 00:43:58,821
- Very nice.

516
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:02,605
I draw and paint in my spare time.

517
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:06,280
- What kind of things
do you like to paint?

518
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,994
- It's kind of abstract,

519
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:12,074
dark, moody.

520
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:15,991
I call it confrontational art.

521
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:18,939
- I like confrontation.

522
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,781
Yeah.

523
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,309
(light music)

524
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:33,932
- It looks like they're finished.

525
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:35,185
I better go.

526
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:38,062
I have a client coming over next.

527
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:40,242
- What kind of client?

528
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:44,514
- Well, I'm a tantric shaman.

529
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,702
- Of course you are.

530
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:49,665

- See ya.

- What?
- You want to make out?

535
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,041
- I heard you the first time.

536
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:27,874

538
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,389

00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:42,029

(knocking)

548
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:27,840
- [Harry] Hello, I'm almost finished.

549
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,013
- Ah, no worries, it's no rush.

550
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,340
How was your stay?

551
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,443
- Great, interesting.

552
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,070
I lost all my credit cards,

553
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,970
and most of my cash is missing,

554
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,723
and I think I may have
been inadvertently involved

555
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:44,833
in sort of human trafficking
or smuggling operation.

556
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:49,365
- Oh, wow, sounds interesting.

557
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,823
(zipping)

558
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:53,240
Mind if I make some coffee?

559
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,323
- Sure, go ahead, it's your home.

560
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:57,920
I hope I can get on my plane,

561
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,168
and I'm not on some sort of watch list.

562
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,760
- Uh-huh.
- it's been crazy.

563
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,200
- Well, I'm glad you had a good time.

564
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
- You Americans are all insane.

565
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,570
No offense.

566
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,403
- None taken.

567
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,470
Oh, can you please remember
to give me a good review,

568
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,100
and I'll give you one?

569
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,954
- [Harry] Yes, of course.

570
00:48:18,954 --> 00:48:19,787
- Great.

571
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:25,415
(cup clanking)

572
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:28,027
- [Harry] Here are the keys.

573
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:31,330
- [Sparkle] Well, I hope
you have a safe flight.

574
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,450
- [Harry] Thanks, if I'm actually allowed

575
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,657
to get on the plane, that is.

576
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:36,020
Thanks, Sparkle, bye.

577
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,955
- Toodles, bye.

578
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:40,455
(funky music)

579
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:54,246
(sighs)

580
00:48:54,246 --> 00:48:55,107
What's this?

581
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:58,663
Oh, you left your jacket.

582
00:49:03,928 --> 00:49:06,595
(gate clanking)

583
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:12,889
It'll be cuter on Eddie, anyway.

584
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,663
(slurps)

585
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,631
(phone dinging)

586
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,131
(funky music)

587
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:44,849
(phone ringing)

588
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:37,565
(footsteps pattering)

589
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:47,623
Here's to surviving another month.

590
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:51,592
(mugs clinking)

591
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,088
(eerie music)

592
00:51:31,128 --> 00:51:33,378
(knocking)

593
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:37,330
Hi, you must be Martin.

594
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,433
- Yes.
- Come in, come in.

595
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,643
I'm Sparkle, welcome to New York.

596
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:45,960
Do you have the money?

597
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,983
- Yes, of course.

598
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:53,220
(chuckles)

599
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,500
- Great, thanks.

600
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,683
Here's the bedroom.

601
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,933
The kitchen, and there's the bathroom.

602
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,533
- It's tiny, huh?

603
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,327
- Well, that's New York for you.

604
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:12,788
There's the keys.

605
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:15,990
And this is the wifi code.

606
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,920
We use the bar's,

607
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,880
so it can be a bit sporadic,

608
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,260
but it's really fast when it's on.

609
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,470
- Okay.

610
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,950
- Oh, and this is super important.

611
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,840
You have to wear this when you're entering

612
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,940
and leaving the apartment.

613
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,030
They've installed security cameras.

614
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,810
They're watching us, making
sure that no one's Share B&Bing.

615
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,430
They've threatened to evict anyone who is,

616
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,670
so we just have to use a little caution.

617
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,220
- Okay, I understand.

618
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,723
- Great, here's an extra
one, just in case you...

619
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,463
Get lucky.

620
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,296
(snickers)

621
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:49,770
Oh, you don't have to wear
it inside of the apartment.

622
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,640
- I know, I'm just trying it on.

623
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,230
- [Sparkle] Okay, great, thanks.

624
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,553
Can I get you a coffee?

625
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,530
- No, thanks.

626
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,623
- How about a beer?

627
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,030
- No, it's a little early for me.

628
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,620
- Okay, well, they're in the fridge.

629
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,250
Help yourself later.

630
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,140
And speaking of later,

631
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,820
I'm DJing at a club around the corner.

632
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,430
I can put your name on the guest list,

633
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,930
and get you some drinks, if you like.

634
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,780
There should be some cute boys there.

635
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,793
- Okay, sure.

636
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,859
- Great.

637
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:24,109

So, have you seen Tarik?

644

- No.

645
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:47,483
He should be here, though.

fucking around somewhere.

- Fuck off.

657
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,210
I'm just worried about him.

658
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,403
- Oh, everyone's worried about Tarik.

659
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:22,240
Poor, poor Tarik.

You know it's not true.

661
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,460
The story he made up about
his terrorist father.

662
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,800
His parents live in New
Jersey, his dad's a dentist.

663
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,633
- Bullshit.

664
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,543
- Have you seen his teeth?

665
00:54:34,507 --> 00:54:37,302
- I still don't believe you.

666
00:54:37,302 --> 00:54:38,385

00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:45,225

it gets a little wobbly.

Have you been here before?

715
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,500
- No, it's just all the toilets

716
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,103
in New York are wobbly.

717
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,013

759
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:11,487
(grunting)

760
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,483
Hi, I'd love to order room service.

761
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,660
Yeah, can we get two steak and eggs

762
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,723
and an oatmeal with almond milk.

763
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,563
Oh, and, no, three coffees.

764
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,593
Thanks.

765
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,961
(phone beeps)

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,226
(phone ringing)

767
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:56,525
- Who the hell is calling?

768
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:57,358
- Hello?

769
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,733
No, just put it on the card.

770
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,563
Wait, what?

771
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,820
Oh, okay, okay.

772
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,653
No, no.

773
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,240
Yeah, just shut up, I'll be right down.

774
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,150
Okay, bye.

775
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:16,996
We gotta go.

776
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:20,085
- What do you mean we gotta go?

777
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:22,010
- [Eddie] We gotta go, prince
charming reported the card.

778
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,550
- [Sparkle] Whoa, we gotta go.

779
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,763
- Stolen?
- Yeah.

780
01:03:28,233 --> 01:03:30,733

781
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:16,620
(keys jangling)

782
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,510
- I hope you had a pleasant stay.

783
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,900
- Yeah, right.

784
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,300
- Be sure to give me a good review,

785
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,400
and I'll do the same for you.

786
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,993
- I'm onto your little scam.

787
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,350
- What?

788
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,513
- Don't play dumb.

789
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,510
You're getting a nasty review from me.

790
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,760
You're lucky I don't call the
cops on you and your cohorts.

791
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,770
- Cohorts?

792
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,510
What on earth do you mean?

793
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,605
Please don't do that,

794
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:40,440
I think there's been some
type of misunderstanding.

795
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,633
Let's talk about this.

796
01:04:42,868 --> 01:04:44,118
- Unbelievable.

797
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,937
(door slams)

798
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:54,513
- Have a good day.

799
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:57,013

01:05:57,373 --> 01:05:58,844
(gasps)

801
01:05:58,844 --> 01:05:59,677
- You scared the shit out of me!

802
01:05:59,677 --> 01:06:02,057
(shushing)

803
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:03,807
- Sparkle's sleeping.

804
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:08,125
- What are you doing up?

805
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:08,958
- Nothing.

806
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:12,164
What are you doing up?

807
01:06:12,164 --> 01:06:13,747
- I couldn't sleep.

808
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,975
Sparkle is right there.

809
01:06:38,713 --> 01:06:40,624
- Come on, now.

810
01:06:40,624 --> 01:06:43,124
(funky music)

811
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,750
Morning.

812
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,643
- What are you two smiling about?

813
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,407
Don't answer that.

814
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:35,357
I don't wanna know.

815
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,170
They sent me a new lease yesterday.

816
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:41,020
They're raising our rent by $995.

817
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,685
- What?!

818
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,047
How can they possibly raise it that much?!

819
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:46,647
- Oh, well, they can do
whatever the hell they want.

820
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,583
- Fuck.

821
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,110
Where are we gonna move to now?

822
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,920
- We'll figure something out.

823
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,870
Don't worry about it.

824
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,940
We still have some time left
on the old lease, don't we?

825
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,720
- Three months.

826
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,630
- [Eddie] Three months!

827
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,020
See, that's some time.

828
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,520
A lot of time.

829
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,840
- Have you guys seen those bad reviews

830
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,600
we're getting on Share B&B?

831
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,870
- Yes.

832
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:09,160
I don't want to think
about that right now.

833
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,670
When it shits, it shits diarrhea.

834
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,503
- Too vivid.

835
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,921
- Is it?

836
01:09:14,921 --> 01:09:16,338

932
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,939
- What are you doing?

933
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:16,171
- [Tarik] I don't want to talk to you.

934
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:17,004
- What?

935
01:12:19,213 --> 01:12:20,067
Slow down, what's happening?

936
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:22,667
- [Tarik] You told Slade I
made up that whole story?

937
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,840
(door clicks)

938
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,872
- No, I--

939
01:12:28,872 --> 01:12:30,450
- [Tarik] Don't...

940
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,283
Don't lie to me.

941
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,033
- Okay, yeah.

942
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,964
But c'mon, everyone was
gonna find out eventually.

943
01:12:38,964 --> 01:12:40,943
- [Tarik] Think I don't know that?

944
01:12:40,943 --> 01:12:42,083
I had a plan.

945
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,673
- Well, you didn't tell me about it.

946
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:45,973
- I didn't think I had to.

947
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,731
(clanking)

948
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:53,520
- You're right.

949
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,693
Okay, I'm sorry.

950
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,083
It's just...

951
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,623
Slade is such an asshole.

952
01:13:01,623 --> 01:13:04,480
- Think I didn't know that?

953
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,023
You think I give a fuck about Slade?

954
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,513
I don't.

955
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,723
He doesn't matter.

956
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,983
But he told everyone.

957
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,563
Including my professor.

958
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,970
And he told the department head.

959
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,111
And he told my parents.

960
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:25,600
(scoffs)

961
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,093
- Shit.
- Yeah.

962
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:30,715
They're not gonna pay
for my tuition anymore.

963
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:35,720
So I'm dropping out of school.

964
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,683
And I'm gonna move home to New Jersey.

965
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,010
Go to community college there

966
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,083
and work for my dad.

967
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:47,074
- [Eddie] What?

968
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,423
That's crazy.

969
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,510
You don't have to move out!

970
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,860
We'll figure something out.

971
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,353
- It's finished.

972
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:03,983
We're finished.

973
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,003
- Don't.

974
01:14:11,164 --> 01:14:11,997
I'm sorry.

975
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,420
Let me fix it.
- No.

976
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,423
- I promise.

977
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,070
- No more promises, alright?

978
01:14:25,306 --> 01:14:26,540
(lips smacking)

979
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,640
Take care of yourself.

980
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,030
Tell Sparkle I said bye.

981
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,020
(funky music)

982
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,863
- Come on, get up now.

983
01:15:18,323 --> 01:15:19,740
- Leave me alone.

984
01:15:20,697 --> 01:15:22,980
- [Sparkle] You've been moping
around this bed for days,

985
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,930
and I'm sick of it!

986
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,790
- I don't feel good.

987
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:28,683
- Well, that's too goddamn bad.

988
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,253
You're coming to my show
tonight, and that's final.

989
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,330
(grunts)

990
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,170
- Okay!

991
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,003
Okay, I'm up.

992
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:43,743
- Good.

993
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,959
Now get dressed and
help me with my makeup.

994
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,460
Sex is simple.

995
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:03,253
It has a definite
beginning, middle, and end.

996
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:05,603
And love is something else.

997
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,910
It sneaks up on you.

998
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,323
Takes control of you.

999
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,520
And once you're lulled
into its complacency,

1000
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,973
it starts slipping away.

1001
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,620
You try to take it back,

1002
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,400
but it's too late.

1003
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,540
That's when the fights start happening.

1004
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,933
And the bitterness and the resentment.

1005
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,523
It's best to just let it go.

1006
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,770
Enjoy it, cherish it while it lasts.

1007
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:35,613
But when it's over, let it be over.

1008
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:38,616
- You have no heart.

1009
01:16:38,616 --> 01:16:40,100
- Oh, I have a heart.

1010
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,763
And believe me, I feel pain
just as much as you do.

1011
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,133
But the heart will heal
itself, if you let it.

1012
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:49,930
- It's not that easy.

1013
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:50,763
- Yes, it is.

1014
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:55,305
(sighs)

1015
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,053
- Okay.

1016
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:02,890
Where's your lighter?

1017
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:05,349
- It's in my purse.

1018
01:17:08,063 --> 01:17:10,730
(opera singing)

1019
01:18:40,738 --> 01:18:42,988
(applause)

1020
01:18:57,961 --> 01:19:00,211
(rustling)

1021
01:19:15,624 --> 01:19:18,291
(bird flailing)

1022
01:19:38,455 --> 01:19:42,205
(sirens blaring in distance)

1023
01:20:08,647 --> 01:20:10,097
- Everything is for sale now.

1024
01:20:12,713 --> 01:20:14,083
Or rather, on loan.

1025
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,853
You don't own anything anymore.

1026
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,023
Everything is shared.

1027
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,417
If you have home or an apartment,

1028
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,667
you share it with
strangers to pay your rent.

1029
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,063
You become a hotel,

1030
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:33,403
a maid,

1031
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,663
a servant in your own home.

1032
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,560
You think about your guests
and what they would like,

1033
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,460
not what you want.

1034
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,323
You don't matter.

1035
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,903
You fade into the background.

1036
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,013
You worry about reviews
and how many likes you get.

1037
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,540
If you have a car you share that,

1038
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,233
you drive drunk rich idiots
around to pay for it.

1039
01:20:59,493 --> 01:21:01,793
The insurance, the gas, the upkeep.

1040
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,900
You provide water and mints

1041
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,220
and worry about your score.

1042
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,370
Just one click away
from losing everything.

1043
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:12,310
If you have anything, you sell it on Ebay

1044
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:15,930
to pay your credit card,
internet, and phone bills,

1045
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:17,330
making sure you get it out on time

1046
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,280
and in the right condition.

1047
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,043
You must stay above average, above 90%.

1048
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,993
It's a full time, 24/7 job.

1049
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:29,510
Buying and selling and renting and sharing

1050
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,190
and branding and rating and posting

1051
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,820
and liking and reviewing and loading

1052
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,610
and unloading and shipping and receiving

1053
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:38,293
and building and growing
and on and on and on.

1054
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,230
If you have a decent body,
you let people see it,

1055
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,113
use it, abuse it,

1056
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,940
dismiss it, play with it,

1057
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,660
destroy it, so you can
pay your gym membership,

1058
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,200
doctor, your dentist, and plastic surgeon

1059
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,830
to fix it so that you can continue

1060
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,153
to have the decent body.

1061
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,940
You sell your eggs to pay off creditors.

1062
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:12,393
You sell your sperm to
help your credit score.

1063
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,233
You've given too much blood,
they won't take any more.

1064
01:22:19,807 --> 01:22:21,500
You sell whatever organs you can spare

1065
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,750
to pay your water,

1066
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,103
gas, and electric bill.

1067
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,583
How much liver do you need really?

1068
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,523
How many kidneys?

1069
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:33,218
Lungs?

1070
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:35,503
Eyes?

1071
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,220
Legs?

1072
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,073
Arms?

1073
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,170
Do you really need a heart?

1074
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,930
You just keep selling things

1075
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,923
until one day you have
nothing and are nothing.

1076
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,493
You simply disappear.

1077
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,230
At least you don't have to worry

1078
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,890
about funeral and burial cost.

1079
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:04,189
(sighs)

1080
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:06,439
(rustling)

1081
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,799
- Is this the last of it?

1082
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:20,299
- Yeah, that's it.

1083
01:24:32,892 --> 01:24:35,559
(door clicking)

1084
01:24:46,227 --> 01:24:47,937
I'm gonna miss you.

1085
01:24:47,937 --> 01:24:50,354
- Don't miss me, remember me.

1086
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,220
- We had some good times.

1087
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,673
- Yeah, we did, didn't we?

1088
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,230
- You sure you don't need help packing

1089
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:02,693
or clearing the place out?

1090
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:07,530
- No, I think I'm just
gonna throw most of it out

1091
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,863
or I'm gonna let the
landlord deal with it.

1092
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,398
I don't need any of this crap.

1093
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:19,027
- You take care of yourself.

1094
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:19,860
- You too.

1095
01:25:30,548 --> 01:25:33,048
(funky music)

1096
01:26:40,322 --> 01:26:43,489
- Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

1097
01:26:46,838 --> 01:26:49,070
- [Sparkle] No, you're fine.

1098
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,320
- Have you decided where you're going?

1099
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,220
- South, like the birds.

1100
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,713
Maybe Florida or Mexico,

1101
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:58,523
Honduras, or Brazil.

1102
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,870
Maybe even the South Pole.

1103
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,440
- It's cold down there.

1104
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,640
- Yeah, I'll be alright.

1105
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,833
Your girlfriend got another client over?

1106
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,400
- No.

1107
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,850
She left me.

1108
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,169
