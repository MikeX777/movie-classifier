00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:17,977
<i>We live in Bishop County.</i>

3
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:22,516
<i>No matter what you do,
somebody knew you would.</i>

4
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:27,420
<i>People talk in this town.</i>

5
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:31,891
<i>Somebody saw it,
another person talked about it.</i>

6
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:37,497
<i>So either you talk
or you're talked about.</i>

7
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,437
<i>So I had to balance
expectations here,</i>

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,473
<i>as a girl and as a Christian.</i>

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>I want to do things, big things,
like those girls in the magazines,</i>

10
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,817
<i>but they call this town
the "fishbowl",</i>

11
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,388
<i>when you climb to the top,
you just slide right back down.</i>

12
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:09,495
<i>Father says if you want to make
God laugh, tell him your plans.</i>

13
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,132
<i>My father is a good man.</i>

14
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:17,137
<i>Every time we drive past
a church, he says,</i>

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,171
<i>"You think that's just
a coincidence?"</i>

16
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,711
<i>And we weren't even talking
about God or nothin'.</i>

17
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,915
<i>He was a God-fearing man
after mom left us.</i>

18
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:43,063
<i>We didn't go out too much
after that.</i>

19
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,101
<i>Not even to church.</i>

20
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:52,505
<i>He didn't like the way
people looked at us.</i>

21
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:56,709
<i>Father said, "Everything happens
for a reason,"</i>

22
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,544
<i>but I don't think
he really believed that.</i>

23
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,915
<i>I know I didn't.</i>

24
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,119
<i>He would cry for mom like it
would bring her back or somethin'.</i>

25
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:12,125
<i>We could hear him go through the seven
stages of grief in just one night.</i>

26
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,880
<i>It wasn't long before father
started wrestling with his faith.</i>

27
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,920
<i>Back and forth, back and forth.</i>

28
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,226
<i>He ended up winning.</i>

29
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,070
<i>We're all concerned
about you here at Bishop High.</i>

30
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:01,540
<i>This is a place where
you should feel safe.</i>

31
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:05,011
<i>I'm not gonna sit here and say,</i>

32
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:10,884
<i>"I know what it's like
to be in your situation."</i>

33
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,951
<i>'Cause I don't.</i>

34
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:18,825
But I will sit here with you
until you say somethin'.

35
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:33,707
You need to take this seriously.

36
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:42,247
A Christian education is like
a spiritual piggy bank.

37
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,986
You have an opportunity to find
your faith here and deposit it.

38
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:52,892
And you know better than anyone else
your age inside or outside these walls

39
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:57,564
that life is going to present
problems, sadnesses,

40
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:00,200
even crushing disappointments.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,201
Hmm?

42
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,273
That's why you need
that piggy bank...

43
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:11,310
to draw from
in times like these.

44
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:19,652
So I want you
to raise your piggy bank.

45
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,023
Come on, up, up, up.

46
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:28,794
That's right.

47
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,302
Now, we're gonna shake it.

48
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,771
Go ahead.

49
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,141
Can you hear anything in yours?

50
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:50,617
That's because faith can't grow
if you don't invest in it.

51
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,792
You ever played <i>Pictionary?</i>

52
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,696
Yeah, okay, great.
Let's do that.

53
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,266
I'll go first.

54
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:39,332
This is the part where you're
supposed to say what it is.

55
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,759
I need something
from you, Jessa.

56
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,732
You're not gonna be able to
continue in the AP program

57
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:16,336
unless you begin to participate
in class.

58
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,274
It's been four months.

59
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,258
So who's gonna be there?

60
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,827
Just you and my family.

61
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,196
I think we're gonna have pizza around
6:00, but you can come early if you want.

62
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,432
- I can't.
- What?

63
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,005
My mom says we can't really
hang out anymore. I'm sorry.

64
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,742
But it's my birthday.

65
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,778
Yeah, I know... know, Rachel,
happy birthday.

66
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:29,408
Miss Simon, now.
Bring your test.

67
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,462
What is that?

68
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,365
My leg.

69
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:57,069
Don't play smart with me, Miss Simon.
Lift up your skirt.

70
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,371
Excuse me?

71
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,078
Your skirt, lift it.

72
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,348
It's just my boyfriend's name.

73
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,284
I'm not goin' to ask you again.

74
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,028
And how long have you been
dating Benjamin Franklin?

75
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,429
Enough!

76
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:31,437
I don't know who you think
you're fooling,

77
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,107
but you've got the right sister
to send you to the wrong place.

78
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,545
I'll see you after school.

79
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,317
You can sit down now.

80
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,593
Whore.

81
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:53,652
Lucy.

82
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:09,235
<i>If you watch closely,
you can see that God is makin' moves.</i>

83
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:12,504
<i>You got that bird flu thing
happening and then... and that got...</i>

84
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:15,074
<i>But we've heard
all of this before.</i>

85
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:17,410
<i>The world is more populated
than it's ever been.</i>

86
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,345
<i>All those people with flaws,
don't you agree?</i>

87
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:22,247
<i>I think he's a really
good Christian.</i>

88
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,118
<i>Hey, they laughed at Jesus, they laughed
at Moses, and they'll laugh at him, too.</i>

89
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:40,165
- Dad, is that Lucy?
- No, no, Carly, no.

90
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,534
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- Give her to me, give her to me.

91
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,336
- I wanna see her, please.
- No, no, no.

92
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:44,636
- Dad!
- Get back inside, honey. Tell your mother.

93
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,305
Mom! Mom!

94
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,709
Mom! Mom, they brought Lucy.
Lucy's dead, mom!

95
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:52,477
She's dead! Mom!

96
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:59,118
Uh, thank you. Just...
just give her. Thank you.

97
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,354
Sorry.

98
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:08,660
Excuse me, uh...

99
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,066
I just drove all the way up
Bishop County.

100
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,968
The, uh...

101
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:21,606
The flyer says it's a...

102
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,513
You've gotta be kidding me.

103
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,724

Did you see Becky out there just now?

00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,404
Was that an accident or...
I mean, I can't stand her.

158
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:02,540
I know. I know, me either.
She's terrible.

159
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:09,047
She wears glasses.
She's not into you.

160
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,716
And she clearly totally
wants me.

161
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,554
Catch her staring. Oh, my God.

162
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,828
They're called "tits."

Let me help you.

T-I-T-S.

165
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:38,843
What? You can't talk
without Mr. Fluffy?

166
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:44,615
Do you wanna go cry to your mommy?
Where is your mom?

167
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,185
You're such a...

168
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,587
Oh!

169
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:55,092
What is wrong with you?

170
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,981
You can go now, Stefanie.

171
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,861
I know you're going
through a lot right now, Belle.

172
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:37,837
But if this happens again, I'm gonna
have to suspend you. Are we clear?

173
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,543
<i>Are you
stressed out about your future?</i>

174
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:50,516
<i>You have nightmares
filled with fire, confusion,</i>

175
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,054
<i>bird flu, nuclear war,
apocalypse.</i>

176
00:19:56,253 --> 00:20:00,892
<i>The solution to all your worries</i>

177
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:05,231
<i>can be found
in the house of the Lord.</i>

178
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,867
<i>But how do you get there?</i>

179
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:15,040
<i>If you want the key to God's
Kingdom, you must join us,</i>

180
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:19,744
<i>prepare yourselves,
and your loved ones.</i>

181
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:27,219
<i>Those who hesitate
will be left behind.</i>

182
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,958
<i>The time is now.</i>

183
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,840
In glory, there is only peace.

184
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:09,981
But achieving that peace
is pain, is effort.

185
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:15,020
Though each step may be painful,
we must keep our eyes on Him.

186
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:20,257
A few steps towards this altar
and you will find rest.

187
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:27,066
You will find comfort in the Lord,
regardless of what you've done or endured,

188
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:33,071
as long as you were willing to
take these few steps right now.

189
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:41,012
The Holy Spirit is telling me
there's one more person.

190
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:48,119
It's telling me you're scared,
and you're wondering, "Is it me?"

191
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,522
Don't be shy now.

192
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,092
Not in His house.

193
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,463

- How are you?
- Good.

213
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,990
Uh, you know, I called.
And left messages.

214
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:33,457
I... I didn't hear back.

215
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:38,630
I... I just wanted to make sure
you and the girls were okay.

216
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:42,067
Yeah, we're... we're good.
Hmm. Better.

217
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,172
Good. I mean, they're...
they're good girls.

218
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:49,540
- Yeah, they are.
- Um...

219
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:55,112
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just going to say it.

220
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,386
People here still have doubts.

221
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,589
They... they're simple people.

222
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:11,029
When you don't come forward
to... to accept, to admit,

223
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:14,031
it's uncomfortable.

224
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:22,907
They... they just need more time
and it looks like you do, too.

225
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,377
Uh, and I'm... I'm sorry.

226
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:33,585
It's not personal, but I have to do
what's best for the church, Rick.

227
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,457
But you know where I stand.

228
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,570
Let's go.

229
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:56,166
Thank you, Lord,
for this meal, for this family,

230
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,673
for these beautiful girls,
for all the things that we have,

231
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:04,041
and for all the things
that are coming.

232
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:08,480
- Amen.
- I'll drink to that.

233
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:18,323
Who's hungry? I'm starving!

234
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,557
- Me too.
- Come on.

235
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:21,193
- I'll eat.
- Toast!

<i>Have you ever felt

237
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:32,337
<i>I did, 17 years ago.</i>

238
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:35,607
<i>I struggled to put food
on the table,</i>

239
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:38,342
<i>to raise an upright family,</i>

240
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:42,446
<i>and then that's when I just fell
into a dark pit</i>

241
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,183
<i>of alcohol, drugs, and despair.</i>

242
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:47,752
<i>That's when I nearly
lost it all.</i>

243
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:57,462
<i>But that's also when I found God
or He found me.</i>

244
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,798
<i>I'm not exactly sure.</i>

245
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:06,704

246
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:11,742
<i>"Ron, my son,

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,289
<i>Don't you wanna be saved?</i>

251
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:28,292
<i>Don't you wanna be with
your family together forever?</i>

252
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:30,295
<i>I could show you how.</i>

253
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:33,565
<i>And when His trumpet roars,</i>

254
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:41,740

00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,261
Where are our lunches, father?

260
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:49,207
It's only $3.

261
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:22,941
There's always something wrong
with him. What else is new?

262
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:30,915
We'll just talk about that
later.

263
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,346
Come on.

264
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,617

anything or not.

00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,468
Hey, look at this one.

271
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,604
Give it to your dad.

272
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,074
I'd like to see that.

273
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:40,845
Maybe you can stop by the house
and give it to him yourself.

274
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,855
Hey. Hey, Henry, come here.
Look at this one.

Right?

278
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,035
Henry thinks you're cute.

279
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:06,503
Nah, man, you can't do Peltz.
Like everybody's gonna be doing Peltz.

280
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:08,340
- Okay.
- Be creative, man, come on.

Oh, shit! Firefighter, man.

Yeah, and tell like it's

00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:18,415
- Yes.
- Rachel, yo, check this out.

00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:20,484
- Oh, this is so dope, right?
- Yeah.

286
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,386
Come on, come on, we'll get you a
costume, too. It'll be great.

a lady firefighter or something.

288

Or like a hot cop.

289
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,906

- Hey.

There's a party on Friday.

00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:57,894
What kind of party?

348
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,832
An end of the world party.

349
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:07,805
This is funny to you?
The end of the world?

350
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,645
- No, uh...
- Good, 'cause it's happening.

351
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:30,394
We do not bring Satan
into this house.

352
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:32,997
Dad, it's just a costume.

353
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,234
Shh. Do not talk back to me.

354
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,947
Princess? Not anymore.

355
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:06,830
Now, who wants to see mommy?

356
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,868
We're gonna be a family again.

374
00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:59,543
I am so sorry.
Can you just give me a moment?

375
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:04,948
- Rick. Rick!
- Yep.

376
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:10,119
- What, uh... What is all this?
- We're having a yard sale.

377
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,522
- You're...
- Are you crazy?

378
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,357
- ...welcome to look around.
- Hi, girls.

379
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,595
Can I have a word with you?

380
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:18,930
Now?

381
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:27,605
What the hell are you thinkin'?
I have the Smiths coming over.

382
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:31,175
I have two more showings today.
We talked about this.

383
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,642
We have the house looking great.

384
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,245
You're having a yard sale!

385
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,646
Oh, my God!

386
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,648
Rick, I thought we had
this conversation.

387
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:41,352
Who's gonna sell this house
for you in less than ten days?

388
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:43,921
- Jessa. Jessa!
- We're on track.

389
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:46,055
- You know I've been very patient and very fair.
- Hi. What's your name?

390
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:48,192
- I let you and your kids stay in this house.
- Oh.

391
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:52,162
Do you know how hard it is to show
a house with people living in it?

392
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:56,300
I mean, look at this,
there is trash everywhere.

393
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:58,968
So this has to look right.

394
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,405
How would you feel, Rick?

395
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:04,240
My name is on that sign.

396
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:08,379
I know that doesn't mean anything to
you, but it means a lot to me.

397
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:10,314
You are makin' my face look bad.

398
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:15,118
We gotta go.
Got another house to see.

399
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:18,988
Wait, where are you going?
We haven't even gone inside yet.

400
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:21,425
Wait, you can't leave yet.
You haven't seen the inside.

401
00:43:21,457 --> 00:43:24,627
The kitchen is to die for and the dining room,
it has a ceiling that is, oh, my God...

402
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,262
- Look, lady.
- So...

403
00:43:26,296 --> 00:43:28,131
We need to go now.

404
00:44:23,252 --> 00:44:24,354

00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,263
Yeah, I was...
I was in the neighborhood.

410
00:45:41,765 --> 00:45:43,367
To go hang with
a friend of mine.

411
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:46,037

412
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:49,606
Greg.

00:46:01,751 --> 00:46:08,191
Well, Greg Davis lives
four doors up on the left.

416
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:13,664

is already in bed.

That it?

422
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:39,189

00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,564

441
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:16,752
Someone has to watch the door.

What's Jessa gonna do?
Pull up her notebook?

443
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:21,658
I could watch the door.
I'm a good door watcher.

00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:25,229
- No, you'd panic and start crying or something.
- Wouldn't start crying.

445
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:31,335

- Someone's coming.

446

- What?
- It's a little long.

- He was told by...
- No.

457
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:41,672
No. You have to believe this.

458
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:43,007
You believe it, right?

459
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:46,376
Let's do it again. Okay?

460
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,820
Hi, my name is Rachel
and I live down the street.

461
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:01,892

Hold on just a second,

Uh... Uh, hi, girls,

464
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,399
Not really.

465
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:13,904

468
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:23,814
God?

469
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:28,519
He said He'd destroy everyone
that doesn't buy this.

470
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:33,589
Um, oh, um, Stefanie,
we've gotta...

471
00:50:33,622 --> 00:50:37,760
Um, we've gotta go do that thing. Sorry.

472
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:44,634
When I was your age, we used to go to tea
parties, we had all different kinds of teas.

473
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:50,107
Lemon Zingers, ginger,
Sleepytime.

474
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,042
That's what you girls
should be doing.

475
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:56,612
I'm Jewish, so I really
don't need this shit.

476
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:01,717
What the hell is this?

477
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:03,586
It's to prepare you
for Judgment Day.

478
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,122
No, I don't go to church much.

479
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:07,624
Well, you don't have to.

480
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:10,894
You just call this number here and
tell them that the Simons referred you.

481
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:13,028
That's our name at the bottom.

482
00:51:13,062 --> 00:51:15,799
Ron Peltz. He said that you could
see your husband and family again.

483
00:51:15,832 --> 00:51:19,803
Huh, after 40 years,
the last person I wanna see is my husband.

484
00:51:19,836 --> 00:51:22,038
Just get off my porch.

485
00:51:22,071 --> 00:51:26,176
Is that your father over there,
tryin' to hide behind that tree?

486
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,944
What's the matter with you?

487
00:51:27,977 --> 00:51:29,980
Sending your daughters in here
to do your business?

488
00:51:30,013 --> 00:51:33,050
Everybody hates you.
Just get the hell out of here.

489
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,735
- Let's go.
- Father's gonna kill us.

490
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,238
Is that my nightie?

491
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,539
What? Mine's in the dryer.

492
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:33,977
- Where's your costume?
- I lost it.

493
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,780
Well, get up.
People are expecting us.

494
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:39,148
- No, I wanna see mom.
- It's not real, you idiot.

495
00:52:39,182 --> 00:52:42,752
- He's gonna kick me out.
- No, he won't. He won't even know.

496
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,657
Joey's goin' to be here soon,
Henry's coming with him,

497
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:50,961
he likes you,
and I know you like him.

498
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:53,964
What if he kisses
Stefanie Fellinger?

499
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:56,699
She kisses everybody.

500
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:01,038
All because
you wouldn't be there.

501
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,764
Uh, let's go. Come on.

502
00:53:49,218 --> 00:53:51,989

Is this where you take
all your girlfriends?

524
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,060
- Are you my girlfriend?
- You never asked.

525
00:57:19,028 --> 00:57:23,500
- So, you gonna be my girlfriend?
- You can't ask now.

526
00:57:26,301 --> 00:57:28,037
I'll ask in a couple
of minutes then.

527
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:40,482

00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:30,499
I've never felt this way before,
you know?

532
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:33,303
And he makes me feel
like a real princess.

533
00:58:34,236 --> 00:58:35,905
I don't even need
this dress.

534
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:39,075
I mean, I could be
wearing anything in fact.

535
00:58:39,107 --> 00:58:41,510
I mean, I should just tell him
that I love him, right?

536
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:43,513
I mean, we're not even gonna be
here in a week

537
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:46,015
and like who even knows
if he's going to Heaven?

538
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,021
What if he was in my head?

539
00:58:52,521 --> 00:58:56,091

Give me another one.

551
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:28,483
- I'm done.
- Is that it?

552
01:00:28,517 --> 01:00:30,953
- Yeah.
- You're up.

553
01:00:46,368 --> 01:00:49,271
When you get tired,
you need to ask for strength.

554
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:55,143
When you get tired,
you ask for Him strength.

555
01:00:55,176 --> 01:00:56,445
I'm hurting.

556
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:01,751
Ask Him for strength.

557
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,421
Please, give me strength.

558
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:08,725
Say it! I am the lowest.

559
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:13,363
I'm the lowest, most wicked,
most sinful, least-deserving.

560
01:01:13,396 --> 01:01:15,531
Louder.

561
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:18,501
I'm the lowest, most wicked,
most sinful, least-worthy.

562
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,072
Don't you lock those arms.

563
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,745
Go to your room.

564
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:38,420
Do this now every night!

565
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:49,399
So when we compare the Bible with
the literature of the ancient Near East,

566
01:01:49,432 --> 01:01:54,102
um, we'll see not only the incredible
cultural and lit... literary heritage

567
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:56,071
that was obviously common
to them,

568
01:01:56,104 --> 01:01:58,740
but we'll see the ideological
gulf that separated them

569
01:01:58,774 --> 01:02:01,344
and we'll see how
biblical writers, uh,

570
01:02:01,377 --> 01:02:04,414
so beautifully and cleverly
manipulated and used these stories,

571
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:08,316
as I said, as a vehicle for the
expression of a radically new idea.

572
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:13,389
They drew upon these sources, but they blended
and shaped them, uh, in a particular way.

573
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:17,059
And that brings us to a critical
problem facing anyone

574
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:21,531
who seeks to reconstruct ancient
Israelite religion or culture

575
01:02:21,564 --> 01:02:24,200
on the basis
of the biblical materials.

576
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:29,171
Um, that problem is
the conflicting perspective

577
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:33,176
between the final editors
of the text

578
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:37,647
and some of the older sources
that are, uh...

579
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:25,727
Show me you're here.

580
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,767
Please, just show me
you're here.

581
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,439
I'll go to church every Sunday.

582
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,144
Whatever it takes, I'll be good.

583
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:47,817
Just get us through this.
Help me.

584
01:03:49,218 --> 01:03:50,520
Help us.

585
01:03:52,754 --> 01:03:54,390
Just give me a sign.

586
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:57,526
Please, just give me a sign.

587
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:14,877
Hey, shouldn't you be in class?

588
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:23,519
Make sure you close it
so the smoke doesn't go in.

589
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:28,524
- Where's Jessa?
- Sleeping.

590
01:04:33,428 --> 01:04:34,696
What are we gonna do?

591
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:37,901
The same thing we do every day.

592
01:04:39,602 --> 01:04:40,937
And you're not worried at all?

593
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,206
They're just stories.

594
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,908
Do you think Heaven
is just a story?

595
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:48,845
I don't know.

596
01:04:53,948 --> 01:04:55,918
Mom didn't think it was a story.

597
01:05:02,258 --> 01:05:04,227
Where do you think she is?

598
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,298
Sometimes I wonder how she could
be happy if we're not there.

599
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,800
'Cause I'm not.

600
01:05:14,669 --> 01:05:16,838
I'm not happy.

601
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:19,542
You're not happy,
nobody's happy.

602
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:26,616
This house is full of her
and there are days where I...

603
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:28,984
I can't even remember her face.

604
01:05:33,321 --> 01:05:35,825
I'm sick of wakin' up
and feeling like this.

605
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:43,865
Do you ever pray for her?

606
01:05:45,934 --> 01:05:49,872
I think about her a whole lot.
Does that count?

607
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,975
Not really.

608
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:03,019
Okay, I know we said
these, but what do you think?

609
01:06:03,051 --> 01:06:04,386
Do you think these will
go with my dress?

610
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,488
- Yes.
- Yeah.

611
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:07,423
Yeah, you like 'em?

612
01:06:07,455 --> 01:06:09,392
Come on, Mace, we're gonna be late!
You look fine!

613
01:06:09,425 --> 01:06:10,392
She's not ready yet.

614
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:11,794
I'm not ready yet!

615
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:13,328
We're gonna miss
our reservation.

616
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:15,564
Well, ugh.
You're distracting me.

617
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:17,033
I'm not even in there!

618
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:19,734
Well, you're distracting me
with your words.

619
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,871
He said the reservation was at
6:30, but it's really at 7:00!

620
01:06:22,905 --> 01:06:24,307
I made the reservation!

621
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:25,774
What? He said what?

622
01:06:25,807 --> 01:06:28,610
He said you'd be late!
And you're still late.

623
01:06:28,644 --> 01:06:31,013
Not that late.
Okay, so one last question.

624
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,782
These or these?

625
01:06:33,816 --> 01:06:35,451
Mm.

626
01:06:35,484 --> 01:06:37,520
- Those.
- You got five minutes!

627
01:06:37,553 --> 01:06:41,390
Mm. Okay, look, I need you guys to
please clean up the bathroom for me,

628
01:06:41,423 --> 01:06:43,359
'cause I made a huge mess
and your dad's gonna kill me.

629
01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:05,381
And you, the earrings that I'm looking for I
can't find, because you took them from me.

630
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:07,816
And I know that about you.
And I love you all.

631
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,786
- Hmm, well.
- It wasn't me.

632
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:18,426
I left some money
on the counter for the pizza,

633
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:22,897
and I really don't want you to stay up
really late, and you're in charge. Bye.

634
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,499
- What?
- That's right.

635
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:25,535
- What? - That's right.
- I love you all!

636
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:59,568
- Yeah. I missed you.
- I missed you.

637
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,838
- Well, I wasn't gone that long, but...
- Yeah, a real long time.

638
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,006
Um, why don't we just
get our check?

639
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,041
- Oh, here you are.
- Oh, yes, we will.

640
01:08:07,075 --> 01:08:10,879
- 1995, Mendoza Malbec.
- Perfect.

641
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:13,548
And what are we
celebrating tonight?

642
01:08:13,582 --> 01:08:15,885
- It's our anniversary.
- Oh, congratulations.

643
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,952
How long have you guys
been married?

644
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:21,457
Twenty years.
Twenty amazing years.

645
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,493
No, thank you, I'm fine.

646
01:08:24,525 --> 01:08:27,028
Okay, she'll have smaller.

647
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,531
No, really, thank you. I'm fine.

648
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:33,135
No, really, just make it small.

649
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:35,504
No, really, I'm fine.

650
01:08:35,537 --> 01:08:38,039
I'll just leave
the bottle for you two.

651
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,881
What?

652
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,915
Hey.

653
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:50,485
Come back to me.

654
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:14,677
<i>The time has come.</i>

655
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:19,781
<i>Tonight, He will reveal Himself
to those who believed,</i>

656
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:25,821
<i>to those of you who believed,
to those of you who spread the word,</i>

657
01:09:27,055 --> 01:09:31,226
<i>you will be rewarded
with eternal life</i>

658
01:09:32,727 --> 01:09:38,066
<i>and will forever be seated
at the right hand of the Lord.</i>

659
01:09:39,834 --> 01:09:45,006
<i>To those unbelievers,
to those who mocked us...</i>

660
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:46,641
I'm sorry.

661
01:09:46,675 --> 01:09:47,642
<i>There will be no reward</i>

662
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:52,615
You did your best. We, uh...
we'll head over to Jessup Street?

663
01:09:53,748 --> 01:09:55,150
We already hit that one.

664
01:09:57,019 --> 01:10:02,624
<i>Completed pamphlets and/or
inclusions will be accepted until 11:30 tonight.</i>

665
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:04,126
- <i>No later.</i>
- Got an idea.

666
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,595
<i>No exceptions.</i>

667
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:37,091
Come on, girls.

668
01:10:43,798 --> 01:10:47,537
Father. Father, please.

669
01:10:50,338 --> 01:10:52,941
Rick. Rick?

670
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,879
- Take one.
- This is not the way, get out this house.

671
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:59,280
This doesn't concern you!
Take one, take this.

672
01:10:59,314 --> 01:11:01,717
The only way you're gonna be
saved, this is the only way.

673
01:11:01,749 --> 01:11:03,351
Girls, please,
pass it out quickly.

674
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,588
There is no
soliciting in this house.

675
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,323
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

676
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,992
Is that what he told you
that I'm crazy?

677
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,596
I see it in your stare.

678
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:15,964
Well, I'm not the one you need
to worry about,

679
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:19,201
'cause He is coming
and He is coming to reckon.

680
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:22,771
And you're not prepared,
you're not prepared, you're not prepared,

681
01:11:22,803 --> 01:11:25,074
none of you are prepared!

682
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:26,841
And I blame him!

683
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:30,613
But I can prepare you!

684
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:32,113
I have the golden ticket.

685
01:11:32,146 --> 01:11:34,783
You touch me again
and I'll break off that arm!

686
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:37,019
- Oh!
- This is my church!

687
01:11:37,052 --> 01:11:38,788
This is my church now!

688
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:47,863
Now, what you don't realize
is you still have a chance.

689
01:11:47,895 --> 01:11:52,801
You can still save yourselves,
because He is an understanding God.

690
01:11:53,869 --> 01:11:55,004
A forgiving God.

691
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,274
It's all I got.

692
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:02,778
Right here, just...
just put my name right here,

693
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:05,280
right... right on the bottom,
just... just take it.

694
01:12:05,312 --> 01:12:06,982
Put my name right there.

695
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:13,187
And you gotta listen to me, because being
in here is not gonna do you any good.

696
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:15,091
Not gonna do any good at all!

697
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:21,996
Now, you got just a few hours to save yourselves,
because at midnight His trumpets will roar.

698
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:24,365
So if I was you
I would get on it.

699
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,236
You don't get one. Let's go.

700
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,256
What happens
when you die?

701
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:49,891
I think you get to be
an angel

702
01:12:49,925 --> 01:12:52,994
by being angelic to people

703
01:12:53,028 --> 01:12:57,365
and sharing with your sisters.

704
01:12:57,399 --> 01:12:58,934
How do you think
you would get to Heaven?

705
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:00,436
If you're helping people.

706
01:13:00,468 --> 01:13:01,970
- Yeah.
- When they need it.

707
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,306
When they need it. Uh-huh.

708
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,842
What if you're helping people when they
don't need it and it's like a surprise?

709
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,079
And nobody knows
you're doing it.

710
01:13:11,113 --> 01:13:15,784
And there's money in a
little bank from me that I'm going to...

711
01:13:15,816 --> 01:13:20,154
when I have a lot of money, I'll give
to poor people that don't have food.

712
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,123
- Oh. That's nice.
- That's a good thing.

713
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:23,859
- I think that...
- That would be a good angel thing.

714
01:13:23,891 --> 01:13:25,327
I think that that's a
really good angel thing.

715
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:25,827
Yeah, that's a very
good angel thing.

716
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:36,003
- I'm scared.
- Don't be.

717
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:38,106
But we didn't get enough people.

718
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,342
We did our best.
He knows that, honey.

719
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:42,378
He knows that.

720
01:13:44,178 --> 01:13:47,917
That's what kinda God He is,
right?

721
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,263
Alright, get ready.

722
01:14:10,105 --> 01:14:12,341
Hold on, don't be scared.

723
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:30,124
Our Father, Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

724
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,495
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

725
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:37,332
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

726
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:38,934
I love you.

727
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:07,129
Did we not make it?

728
01:15:12,601 --> 01:15:14,570
- Father. No, no, no...
- Just...

729
01:15:14,602 --> 01:15:15,937
- Don't go.
- Wait here.

730
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:06,628
<i>Father said we'd laugh
about all of this sooner or later.</i>

731
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:15,236
<i>That Bishop County was too small
of a pond for us big fish.</i>

732
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:25,146
<i>He said we'd only be here
for a little bit. A week tops.</i>

733
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:57,513
<i>We knew he wasn't looking for the
perfect house, he was looking for work.</i>

734
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,318
<i>He would always talk about
the houses he saw that day.</i>

735
01:21:04,385 --> 01:21:07,388
<i>White picket fences,</i>

736
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:11,959
<i>board swings, big backyards.</i>

737
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:16,397
This one house, you'd love it.
It was absolutely beautiful.

738
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:18,833
Had picket fences,
a porch swing...

739
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:20,368
- Yeah, I like it.
- Five bedrooms.

740
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:26,708
<i>He was a liar.</i>

741
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:30,711
<i>He was still our father.</i>

742
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:49,731
<i>Not a day went by where he didn't
try to get past everything.</i>

743
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:57,872
<i>But like father used to say, "If you want
to make God laugh, tell Him your plans."</i>

744
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,312
Alright, take it down there.

745
01:22:05,913 --> 01:22:07,415
Do it like this.

746
01:22:15,022 --> 01:22:16,624
Hopefully, you'll get better.

747
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:21,562
I gotta pee.

748
01:22:29,837 --> 01:22:33,441
Hey! What are you doin'?

749
01:22:33,473 --> 01:22:35,310
I'm so sorry, I just, uh...

750
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:44,919
What, man?
Are you slow or somethin'?

751
01:22:47,954 --> 01:22:50,359
Why are you lookin' at me
like you're stupid?

752
01:22:59,801 --> 01:23:01,870
Get your ass back to work.

753
01:23:01,903 --> 01:23:04,740
That tree is comin' out
of today's pay.

754
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,311
I think you need to walk a little
faster, get your ass over there.

755
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:16,016
Come on, boy, go.

756
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:18,320
Get your ass back to work, man.

757
01:23:23,056 --> 01:23:24,825
I'm sure he'll be here
any minute.

758
01:23:37,672 --> 01:23:39,308
What are you doing?

759
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:58,779
