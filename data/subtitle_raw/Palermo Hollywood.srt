1
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:46,795
Are you okay, man?

2
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,628
<i>I have a world that's full of sensations</i>

3
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,128
<i>A world that's full of vibrations</i>

4
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:19,962
<i>I can give it all to you</i>

5
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,337
<i>I have sweetness to offer</i>

6
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,005
<i>Many caresses to give you</i>

7
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,173
<i>If you are willing to love me</i>

8
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:32,257
<i>They'll be the happiest days</i>

9
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,229
Russian!

10
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:37,502
<i>That you will ever live
With all the colorful lights</i>

11
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,420
<i>I want you to see</i>

12
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:43,814
<i>I have a thousand arms just to hug you</i>

13
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,334
<i>A thousand lips just to kiss you</i>

14
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,462
<i>All my hopes I set on you</i>

15
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:53,878
<i>I'm full of poems of love and roses</i>

16
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,378
<i>A million wonderful things</i>

17
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:59,586
<i>And they are all for you</i>

18
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,837
<i>They'll be the happiest days</i>

19
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,459
<i>That you will ever live</i>

20
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:10,094
<i>With all the colorful lights
I want you to see</i>

21
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:11,897
<i>Amazing!</i>

22
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:23,182
<i>They'll be the happiest days</i>

23
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,719
<i>That you will ever live</i>

24
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:30,784
<i>With all the colorful lights
I want you to see</i>

25
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,360
<i>I have a thousand arms just to hug you</i>

26
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:35,695
<i>A thousand lips just to...</i>

27
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,128
- Hey, bro!
- Hi, how's it going?

28
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:41,104
- It's your turn to buy.
- Me? Hey, I just got here.

29
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:42,563
You didn't even call me. What's up?

30
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,545
- Guys!
- I'll go, man.

31
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,928
And to celebrate,
I'm getting strawberry sparkling wine!

32
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:48,947
- Great, Russian!
- Good!

33
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,337
Great, Russian!

34
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,707
Look at the Russian, he coughs it up!

35
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,141
Aren't Jews supposed to be cheap?

36
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:00,755
- What about the strawberry sparkling wine?
- It's the only thing they had.

37
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:06,642
- Your little sister is so hot! Gorgeous!
- Hey! Watch your mouth, asshole.

38
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,711
- It's just a comment, an observation.
- No one messes with Juli, understood?

39
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,579
Come here. Are you nervous? Sit down.

40
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,043
Hi, guys.

41
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,086
- What's up, Juli? Are you with those guys?
- No way, they're from school.

42
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:19,483
Gotcha.

43
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,391
Come on, walk.

44
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:31,411
NEIGHBORS' MEETING
EVERY THURSDAY AT 10 P.M.

45
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:34,921
PERSONAL INFORMATION

46
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,856
The Russian is the best, man!

47
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,764
I'm okay, man, I'm okay.

48
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,387
Be cool now, because he's...

49
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:41,218
- How are you, Dante?
- What's up, Mario?

50
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,941
- How are you?
- What's up, man?

51
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,369
- Good?
- Do you want some maté?

52
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:47,957
- Yeah, sure, I want some maté.
- What are you guys up to?

53
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,436
Another riot? What's this one about?

54
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:55,420
- The dollar rate or what?
- Everyday there's a new problem.

55
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,845
It's hard to earn a living
out there nowadays.

56
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,610
- Tough, isn't it?
- Huh?

57
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,070
- It's tough, right?
- Yeah. But you guys have a blast.

58
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,337
Why? No, we don't.

59
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,813
- It affects me too, you know?
- You came back early today.

60
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,461
- Ximena?
- She's not here.

61
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,562
- Don't tell me she's at her mother's.
- Yeah, she is.

62
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,209
Damn it!

63
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,021
- Beba, can I come in?
- No, it's late. Didn't you notice?

64
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,461
- Beba, please. Let me in.
- No!

65
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,725
- Ximena!
- Pablo, calm down!

66
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,353
Pablo, can you calm down, please?

67
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,980
What's going on? Get out, Pablo,
I don't want to talk to you now!

68
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,215
- What did I do now?
- Nothing! You do nothing!

69
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,620
Can't you see that's the problem?

70
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,205
You don't give a shit
about Valentina and me! We're your family!

71
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:54,248
- You only care about yourself!
- Baby, that's not true.

72
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,854
Don't call me "baby"!
And it is true! You're selfish as fuck.

73
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,209
I can't plan a future with you.

74
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,586
- Ximena, let's go home and talk.
- Don't listen to him.

75
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,268
- Ximena, please.
- What? Get off me!

76
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Valen!

77
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,003
Valen, sweetie!

78
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,247
I'm not going back to your house.
Well, it's your dad's.

79
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:14,598
We're not married. I'll stay here.

80
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:16,787
- Stop it. Come here.
- But I'm right. It's not your house.

81
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,562
- Not in front of the baby, come here.
- Well...

82
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,336
Who am I? What's my name? The Ru...

83
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,586
- The Russian!
- Very good! Give me a kiss.

84
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,504
Three! Again.

85
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:28,619
Here!

86
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,268
There it is!

87
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,171
Here.

88
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,126
Talk to you tomorrow?

89
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,600
<i>I'll tell you the truth, my love</i>

90
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,658
<i>I cheat on you with my dick
But not with my heart</i>

91
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,239
<i>I love you!</i>

92
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,970
Cumbia <i>with Damas Gratis</i>

93
00:10:55,608 --> 00:11:00,639
<i>Baby, we'll make out today</i>

94
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,397
<i>I got high again today</i>

95
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,402
<i>I can't stop...</i>

96
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,586
Thanks, Judy.

97
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,586
- Judy, my drugs, please!
- Good morning, right?

98
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,753
No.

99
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:38,086
I can imagine, it must be a nightmare
for you waking up at this time.

100
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,340
Don't speak to your sister like that!

101
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:43,475
- Let him, Daddy.
- "Let him" what, you idiot?

102
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:49,670
See what you've done?
Do you want to upset him or what?

103
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,545
- At least he doesn't support me.
- Are you kids fighting already?

104
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,586
If he knew where you get
your money from...

105
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,545
- From stealing, where else?
- Mario, don't ever say that!

106
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,363
How do you think thieves look like?

107
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,586
- Mario!
- What?

108
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,670
Please!

109
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,002
Be like him, Mom, just read the newspaper.

110
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:14,128
- You know nothing about me.
- Well, you know nothing about me either.

111
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,086
Ernesto, please. Now's not the time.

112
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:20,809
No one gave me anything, you brat.
I worked to get to where I am.

113
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
And where are you?

114
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:25,490
Don't talk like that to your father.
He doesn't deserve it.

115
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,975
After everything he's done for you.

116
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,951
Do you realize? You've raised a monster.

117
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,571
Mario, do you need money?

118
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,586
- What's my name?
- The Russian.

119
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,218
- Where does that one go?
- Is that what you're wearing, Pablo?

120
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,420
And inside?

121
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,504
Where are you going to?

122
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:58,586
"Angley"?

123
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,634
- To work!
- Yes.

124
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:01,718
Why don't you wear this?

125
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:03,588
Bye. Give me a kiss.

126
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,129
- Thank you!
- You're crazy about her!

127
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,158
- Where are you guys off to?
- To the club.

128
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,907
- Which one?
- <i>The</i> club. And you?

129
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,545
I don't know,
I'll check what the girls are up to.

130
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,378
Eugenia wants to go see Damas Gratis,
but I really don't want to.

131
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,911
You should come with us.

132
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:23,350
- What are you up to?
- What do you mean?

133
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:27,249
Don't play dumb with me.
I saw you with some girl the other day.

134
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,340
When, Juli? You're the only one.

135
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,961
- Bullshit!
- I'm saving myself for marriage.

136
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,562
- What? You want to marry me?
- Of course.

137
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,048
Really? How adorable!

138
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,336
Yeah, right!
If your buddy leaves, you do too.

139
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,420
- Where?
- To Italy, with Ximena's uncle.

140
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,711
Come on, you know.
You guys are like brothers.

141
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,968
You know more about each other
than about yourselves.

142
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:48,422
For sure!

143
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,413
- Russian, are you ready?
- Let's go.

144
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,461
- Bye, Juli.
- Bye.

145
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,741
And one for me? For the Russian?

146
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,446
Come on!

147
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:51,998
Guys, do you have any acid?

148
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:54,461
Do you have any acid?

149
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,988
- Fuck off!
- Okay, man.

150
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:37,668
Russian!

151
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,754
Thanks, Russian!
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

152
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,205
Come on!

153
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,211
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

154
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:24,295
Me?

155
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,920
Very good. Great.

156
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,124
That's great.

157
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:30,626
- Do you have any...?
- Yeah.

158
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,103
"This is happening right now,
and it will never happen again."

159
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:43,996
Do you think this was meant for us?

160
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:50,337
- You could see it that way...
- How? Tell me.

161
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:57,461
My theory is that it was wonderful
and we should enjoy it while it lasts

162
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,170
because it won't happen again.

163
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:06,252
And another theory
is that that wonderful moment

164
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,784
was the result of something that was
always there, but was never expressed.

165
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:10,867
So...

166
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,545
we should enjoy it now
because this moment is unique,

167
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,855
and will be remembered forever.

168
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,950
- I like that theory.
- I like it too.

169
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,368
Wait until I tell the girls...

170
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:25,420
Wait, I was kidding!

171
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,129
Where were you?

172
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,139
Mario, it's your life
you're throwing away.

173
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Turn that thing off.

174
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:01,212
- Turn it off, I'm talking to you.
- What did I do now?

175
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,668
I don't know. You tell me.

176
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,377
Since when do you care about my life?

177
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,973
You're my son. I'll always care about you.

178
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,477
- When will you stop, Mario?
- When will I stop what?

179
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:16,538
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your life, Mario.

180
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,939
When will you stop throwing it away?

181
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:21,170
Who do you hang out with?

182
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,500
Do you remember
what your grandfather used to say?

183
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:26,920
"If you make your bed right..."

184
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:30,536
"You'll sleep well," yeah!
Always with sayings and proverbs!

185
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,382
Can't you talk to me like a father?

186
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,002
"Hey Mario, how are you doing?

187
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,543
Did you go out? Did you get laid? Great!
Did she have nice tits?"

188
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:43,159
You think I'd be a better father
if I asked you if you got laid?

189
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,336
Sorry, I don't care about that.

190
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,752
What I care about is your future.

191
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:52,714
Are you working on something solid
that will make you proud and respectable?

192
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,045
Maybe.

193
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,322
But you wouldn't think so.

194
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,939
It has nothing to do with being Jewish,

195
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,591
the Belgrano neighborhood
or having money.

196
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,252
What's the problem
if I want those things for you?

197
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,877
That's the problem!
Can't you see? You don't want to see it.

198
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,961
You know what? It's just like TV, look.

199
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:12,223
You can ignore it if you want,
but the world keeps turning.

200
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,550
Don't get her pregnant.

201
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,420
- Hi, Vale!
- Hi, Pabli!

202
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:44,920
- You've been missing in action!
- I've been studying a lot.

203
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:52,087
Careful there! Did you scratch it?

204
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:55,462
For sure!

205
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,462
Italy!

206
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:15,503
Yeah, what about it?

207
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:22,598
Come on, asshole!
Aren't you going to tell me about it?

208
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,732
Ximena has an uncle in Florence
who can get me a job there.

209
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,127
First, we'd go for three months.

210
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:36,403
If things work out,
we'll come back and do all the paperwork.

211
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,729
And you weren't going
to tell me about it?

212
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,261
It wasn't the right time, Russian.
I knew you'd be pissed.

213
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,714
Of course I'm pissed, man!
We're friends, aren't we?

214
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:49,836
Yeah, you're like a brother to me,
but I can't go on like this.

215
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,120
I have to get my act together.

216
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,753
This is Ximena's idea. She convinced you.

217
00:21:56,452 --> 00:22:00,141
Look, man, I don't want to steal anymore.
I feel worse every time we do it.

218
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:02,295
And Ximena gets more and more upset.

219
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:06,587
She doesn't get over it easily anymore.
Sometimes, she doesn't come home for days.

220
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,247
I don't want to lose her, man.
Try to understand.

221
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,346
Also, I need about seven grand
for the paperwork

222
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,697
and the plane tickets.

223
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:17,795
Do I look like I have seven grand?
It would take me a year to save up.

224
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,878
It's just a dream.

225
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,295
Fine, man, you know I'd be the first one
to help you out.

226
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,436
But I'd lose a friend.

227
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,528
However, if that's your decision,
I respect it.

228
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,208
Family comes first.

229
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,157
Thanks, Russian. I love you, buddy.

230
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:45,101
- The apprentice beats the master.
- I let you win, fool!

231
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:46,583
- I won't beat you anymore.
- Me?

232
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,598
- There's the Turk.
- Do you have the money?

233
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:57,221
Do I have to think of everything?

234
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,587
Wow! Good work, boys!

235
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,837
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

236
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:29,993
Pablo, sit down!

237
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:33,420
Forgive him, Stevie, he was with Roberto
last night and today he can't sit down.

238
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,337
Learn from the Russian.
Don't be ungrateful.

239
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:41,558
- Do you want a line?
- Can I?

240
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,670
That and much more, sweetie.

241
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,095
Damn!

242
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,683
Do you want the whole package?
Pussy and blow?

243
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:56,607
- Excuse me, Esteban, the thing is...
- You're not excused.

244
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,837
You're so ungrateful.

245
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,337
Is money all you care about, then?

246
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:03,715
Here.

247
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,212
Come on, man. Just do a bump!

248
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:34,295
You know, Fag... I mean, Stevie.

249
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,002
Pills are for rookies.

250
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,045
We can do better than that.

251
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:43,525
Why are you looking at me like that, man?
You of all people.

252
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:47,837
Okay, guys,
if you don't want to fuck, get out.

253
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,253
I have things to do.

254
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,786
Russian, here's your money.

255
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,462
Later, kid.

256
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:00,377
Hi, sweetie.

257
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:02,863
- So? Did you like it?
- You were great!

258
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,604
- Really, don't fuck with me.
- I'm serious!

259
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,933
I wanted to get in there
and make love to you with that hat on.

260
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:10,753
- You're such an idiot.
- I mean it.

261
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,712
Honey, I have some good news.

262
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,712
I talked to my uncle.

263
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,300
He asked me if we were coming or not.

264
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,854
I told him we were saving up money
for the plane tickets,

265
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:24,905
that we didn't want to show up broke,
and we were still a bit short,

266
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,001
and guess what?

267
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,045
He said he'd lend us
the money for the tickets,

268
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:30,973
and that he'll get us jobs
once we get there!

269
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,170
That's great.

270
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:38,586
- What? Aren't you happy?
- Yeah, it's great.

271
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,170
Pablo, if you thought it was great,
you wouldn't be saying it like that.

272
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,804
Damn, why is everything a problem
with you?

273
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:48,170
How am I supposed to react?
What am I supposed to say?

274
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:53,836
"Bye! I'll just pack my things,
and that's it, I'm off to Italy!"

275
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,420
I'll say goodbye to my family,
to my dad, to my sister. "Bye, everyone!"

276
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:01,795
Fine, Pablo, never mind.

277
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,986
We always end up doing what you want.

278
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,878
That's the way it is.

279
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,045
You don't want
to make plans with me anymore.

280
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,170
You want to keep partying,
fucking other girls, and it's fine.

281
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:17,212
- Ximena, you're crazy.
- No.

282
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:21,460
If I'm right, just tell me.

283
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,295
I'll understand.

284
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,183
But I can't go on like this, Pablo.

285
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:31,444
Pablo, look at me.

286
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,500
If you want to be with me,
you have to actually be with me.

287
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:44,443
I want to.

288
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,337
Yes, I want to be with you.

289
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:49,212
I want to, yes.

290
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,753
NO TO THE IMF

291
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,434
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Juli, it's me, Mario.

292
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:07,087
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

293
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,837
<i>Pablo's not here,
he went to see Xime dance.</i>

294
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,523
- <i>Do you want to wait for him?</i>
- Can I come in?

295
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:33,045
Juli, I actually came to talk to you.

296
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:35,438
See?

297
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:40,212
I think this whole thing
is going to be a mess, you know...

298
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,420
I mean us, being together.

299
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:45,837
Pablo's going to freak out.

300
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:50,503
I know him. To him, you're untouchable.
To me, you're untouchable!

301
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,146
If he finds out any of the guys
tries to make a move on you, he'd go nuts!

302
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,628
And besides, it would never work,
we're too different.

303
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:06,170
I mean, I'm much older,
and I'm on a different vibe.

304
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:15,068
Pablo's like a brother to me, and you too,
you are like my sister, you know?

305
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,795
A friend's sister,
you're like a step-sister to me.

306
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:22,836
And I don't want to fuck that up!
Because you and I get along so well.

307
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,017
This would mess things up, for sure.

308
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:27,670
Pass that joint!

309
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:32,170
Anyway, I was so fucked up yesterday,
I didn't know what I was doing.

310
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:38,545
I mean, it's not like I didn't know.
I just didn't think of the consequences.

311
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:42,337
You know? I'd marry you, Juli.

312
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,853
Besides, you know how I am,

313
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:48,377
I'm not a one-woman man,

314
00:29:48,462 --> 00:29:51,098
and you deserve much more.

315
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:55,127
But really, I'm not ready
for marriage, you know?

316
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:56,946
And it's not you, it's me.

317
00:29:58,795 --> 00:30:02,586
It's this damn country we live in,
and this situation...

318
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,377
I'm a mess. I need you to understand me.

319
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:07,170
So, well, I don't know.

320
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,420
It's extremely important that we...
You know?

321
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:14,752
We... You need to share my point of view,
because we need to straighten this out.

322
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:16,961
Mario, I completely agree.

323
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,587
- What?
- I completely agree with you.

324
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,569
So, should I let you know
when I want to get married?

325
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:47,420
Or what do you want to do?

326
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,444
Julieta, what are you doing?

327
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,503
This.

328
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,878
What are you looking at?

329
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:46,336
You.

330
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,877
- Don't look at me.
- Why?

331
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:50,502
- Because I'm embarrassed.
- Why?

332
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:52,962
I'm not used to you seeing me naked.

333
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:57,462
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

334
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,961
Are you afraid your buddy will show up?

335
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:04,212
No, don't say that, girl.

336
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,771
Don't worry,
every time Beba's watching the baby

337
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:08,878
they don't come back until 6 a.m.

338
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:19,601
Do you have any album by Roberto?

339
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,791
<i>MUCHACHO</i> ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK

340
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:21,876
Of course.

341
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:45,752
<i>Destiny and time
Have struck me down so many times</i>

342
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:49,795
<i>But I keep moving on
And never let it get me down</i>

343
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:53,767
<i>It's not worth it to cry
Or beg to make it stop</i>

344
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,920
<i>You have to think
That good things will come by</i>

345
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:02,086
<i>I once had all the friends
That came with money I once had</i>

346
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,170
<i>And in bohemian nights
We all would drink until we drowned</i>

347
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,044
<i>But that's in the past
Time's taken it away</i>

348
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,711
<i>And as you can see I stand here anyway</i>

349
00:34:13,794 --> 00:34:17,129
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

350
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,379
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

351
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:25,294
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

352
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:29,711
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

353
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,836
<i>Wine, women, parties, love</i>

354
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,050
<i>Are some of many pleasures
That make up for all the pain</i>

355
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:45,836
<i>We must smile and forgive</i>

356
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,535
<i>Because in the end, why suffer?</i>

357
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:54,419
<i>I made a bet with life
That I would never cry again</i>

358
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:58,545
<i>And cheated more than once
So I could win from time to time</i>

359
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,461
<i>I don't know how to lose
Because I was born to win</i>

360
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:05,545
<i>And as you can see I stand here and laugh</i>

361
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:09,711
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

362
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:13,795
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

363
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,795
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

364
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:21,867
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

365
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:30,461
<i>If once sorrow broke my heart</i>

366
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,670
<i>I just carried on with all the pain
I didn't pay attention to it</i>

367
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:38,336
<i>I joined forces with time
And all the pain then went away</i>

368
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,961
<i>Because pain was always my friend</i>

369
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:46,753
<i>Those things I dream about
I doubt they ever will come true</i>

370
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:50,961
<i>In my journey in life
Many of my dreams have long been overdue</i>

371
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,575
<i>But yes, I gained as much
As much as I did live</i>

372
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,711
<i>And today I see I didn't lose a thing</i>

373
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,754
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

374
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,795
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

375
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:09,836
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway</i>

376
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:14,455
<i>- In the end, life goes on anyway!
- Yes, it does!</i>

377
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:18,627
<i>- In the end, life goes on anyway
- Sing with me, sing it loud</i>

378
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:22,211
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway!</i>

379
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:26,295
<i>In the end, life goes on anyway...</i>

380
00:36:48,504 --> 00:36:50,336
What's the matter? Did I scare you?

381
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,823
Fuck you, Wall!

382
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,914
- I shat myself.
- What are you doing here?

383
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,836
Having an ice cream, man,
what does it look like?

384
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Are you alone?

385
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,334
We're off to Bustamante.
Do you want to come?

386
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:04,430
- The place with the Cuban girls?
- Yes, they've got great whores there!

387
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,481
- Come on! Let's go!
- No, I'm done for the day.

388
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:09,443
I was with Pablo at the Fag's before,
and I'm still fucked up.

389
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:12,503
The Russian, turning down pussy?
Who are you?

390
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,129
He must've been eating pussy all night!

391
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:19,655
- Sure, man.
- Yeah, eat you ice cream. For your cramps.

392
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Bye.

393
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,738
I just ran into Enrique and the Wall.

394
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,711
Did they see us?

395
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:37,836
I don't think so.

396
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,705
- What's up, faggot?
- Nothing.

397
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,334
Man, I told you about the Fag.

398
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:05,170
- Hey, it's money. It'll be quick.
- What kind of job is it?

399
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:08,508
An express kidnapping.

400
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:11,961
Listen carefully.

401
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,170
If everything goes well,
there's good money for everyone.

402
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,506
The Turk is going with you.

403
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:23,528
And listen. You'll do as he says.

404
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,045
Understood?

405
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,609
- Put it on.
- Turn around.

406
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:55,295
- Turn around, motherfucker!
- Wait! What do you want?

407
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,545
Come on, bitch, or I'll kill you!
Turn around!

408
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,753
Wait, you don't need to do this! Listen!

409
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:03,045
I have my wallet in my coat pocket,
grab it!

410
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,211
Shut the fuck up, man.
Don't make me go crazy!

411
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:13,178
EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

412
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:19,992
Turn left here.

413
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,973
- We'll end up in the middle of nowhere.
- Exactly.

WELCOME TO QUILMES BEACH

419
00:42:05,254 --> 00:42:06,254
Get him out.

420
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:10,968
Stop, motherfucker!

421
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,124
Where the fuck are we? Stop, man!

422
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,092
Stop!

423
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:19,432
Stop!

424
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:23,129
Come here! Come here, you son of a bitch!

425
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,853
Sorry about this. I didn't know
we were coming all the way here.

426
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:34,613
But don't worry about it.
We'll be out of here in no time.

427
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,336
Ximena will be mad as hell
if I don't pick her up on time.

428
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,868
I have to take the baby to the doctor.

429
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:46,996
Let's hope they pay us soon.

430
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,170
Do you know how much it is?

431
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:54,327
878 STREET

432
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:02,569
The call's been made.
Now we just have to wait.

433
00:44:04,336 --> 00:44:07,754
You two watch the car,
I'll stay with Bonaventura.

434
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:26,728
With whom? Who's the guy?

435
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,061
I don't know. I thought he was a nobody.

436
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,180
Stop, motherfucker!

437
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:53,805
Come here, you son of a bitch!

438
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:57,769
Motherfucker!

439
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:00,664
Son of a bitch!

440
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,931
What's going on, man? Why are they taking
so long to bring the money?

441
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,883
They're cheap bastards, man.

442
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:18,515
We should be on our way back already.

443
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:20,754
Here he comes the Turk.

444
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,685
There's not much time left.
We've made our demand.

445
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:30,736
If the money doesn't turn up...

446
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:43,243
Man, this shit stinks.

447
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,916
It's going to be fine. Stop worrying.

448
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,164
I don't get it.
This is not an express kidnapping.

449
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,247
It's taking forever!

450
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:18,004
Besides, that Turk looks shady as hell,
I don't trust him.

451
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:20,449
I told you, man.

452
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,629
I told you not to do business
with the Fag!

453
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:26,930
This is the last time
I do a job for that son of a bitch!

454
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:32,177
If he doesn't come out now,
I'm getting the hell out of here!

455
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,336
Don't be an idiot, man.

456
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,656
Take a step out in this area
and you're dead! Are you nuts?

457
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,789
I don't give a shit!

458
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,055
What the fuck happened here?

459
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,226
Help me lift him up.

460
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:17,240
No, stop, man!

461
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,450
Stop, you son of a bitch! Please!

462
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:22,961
Come on, walk!

463
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:25,754
Walk!

464
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:29,045
Stop, please!

465
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:31,728
Here. Put him down.

466
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:39,420
Wait, what are you saying? Are you crazy?

467
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:40,878
Do as I say, kid.

468
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,729
No way! You're nuts!

469
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:44,461
Listen, you little shit!

470
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:48,169
They won't pay! And this is what happens
when people don't pay! Come on!

471
00:47:51,379 --> 00:47:53,851
You son of a bitch!

472
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:57,170
Do it now.

473
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:59,961
I'm out of here!
This is not what we agreed!

474
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:04,586
Pablo?

475
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,503
Hold on, Turk. Take it easy!

476
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:09,420
- Shoot him!
- No, man, wait!

477
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:12,128
I'll count to three. One...

478
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:13,378
Hold on, man, please...

479
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:14,461
Two...

480
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,586
Wait, man!

481
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:46,691
My two heroes!
Get over here, give me a hug.

482
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:51,823
What's wrong? Why the long faces?
You're going to make me cry, guys.

483
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:54,492
You're going to make me cry.

484
00:49:55,722 --> 00:49:57,836
You did a great job.

485
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:00,754
And now you'll get the reward you deserve.

486
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,479
But most importantly...

487
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,055
now we're like family.

488
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:11,682
You do my dirty laundry
and I'll do yours, get it?

489
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,961
Esteban, the guy is dead.

490
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,170
It was your fault, honey.

491
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:16,601
It was really unfortunate.

492
00:50:17,285 --> 00:50:18,961
It's all in a day's work, as they say.

493
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:22,670
- That wasn't part of the deal!
- It's okay to be a little nervous,

494
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:25,461
allow yourself to feel like that,
but just for a while.

495
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:28,508
Otherwise, you can't enjoy the rewards
of hard work.

496
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:35,004
Here, five thousand.

497
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:21,421
Hey, man, are you okay?

498
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:26,967
- Are you okay, dude?
- I told you, man.

499
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,195
How many times did I tell you that?

500
00:51:29,744 --> 00:51:31,595
Do you have any idea
what we've just done?

501
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:34,604
The Fag's got us in his pocket.

502
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:38,254
You're fucked, Mario.
There's no going back now.

503
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,086
You're like me now.

504
00:51:40,494 --> 00:51:43,086
- What are you talking about?
- Isn't that what you want to be?

505
00:51:44,379 --> 00:51:46,855
Aren't you always trying to prove
how much of an underdog you are?

506
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:49,420
Well, you made it.
There's no going back now!

507
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:51,584
Calm down, why are you mad at me?

508
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:55,600
It's not my fault. I had no idea
it was going to end up like this.

509
00:51:55,684 --> 00:51:56,964
What happened is really serious!

510
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,740
The worst that could've happened!

511
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:02,504
But try to look ahead, I...

512
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:04,403
I did this for you.

513
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:08,684
Did you know about this?

514
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:13,004
Russian, did you know about this?
Stop the car!

515
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:22,628
No, I didn't! How was I supposed
to know he was going to die?

516
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,586
I just wanted us to get five grand each!

517
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,253
When did he tell you all that?

518
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:27,961
Yesterday.
Before we left, the Fag told me,

519
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:29,505
"Come back, I have something for you."

520
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,341
When I got in, everyone was so fucked up.

521
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:33,655
He asked me if I wanted
to earn ten grand in two hours.

522
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:36,295
"Of course," I said.
You would've done the same!

523
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:38,887
You are such an idiot!
You don't know anything!

524
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,336
Why do you even steal? Tell me. For spite?

525
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,836
To get back at your dad?

526
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:45,170
Who do you think you are? The pope?

527
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:48,046
You're no saint. Give back all the money
you've stolen, then!

528
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,766
Is this all my fault now?
You're the one who shot him!

529
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:54,920
- To save your life, motherfucker!
- I didn't ask you for any favors!

530
00:52:55,545 --> 00:52:57,670
Are you talking to <i>me</i> like that? To me?

531
00:52:57,754 --> 00:53:00,838
After everything I've done for you?
After treating you like a brother?

532
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:03,983
You selfish bastard!
You're going to end up all alone!

533
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:07,309
Go home, Pablo. We'll talk tomorrow.

534
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:24,472
No!

535
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:30,396
<i>I'm looking for an ideal girl</i>

536
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:33,744
<i>Who likes to smoke</i>

537
00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:37,285
<i>I'm looking for an ideal girl</i>

538
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,456
<i>You are like a drug</i>

539
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,425
<i>You make me fall for you</i>

540
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:50,274
<i>You make me go crazy</i>

541
00:53:51,024 --> 00:53:53,720
<i>You are my girl, my illegal girl</i>

542
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:17,890
NEWSPAPERS

543
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,988
FRESH ORANGE JUICE

544
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:08,211
<i>I was coming from presenting a commercial
at a building,</i>

545
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:09,398
<i>because I'm a filmmaker,</i>

546
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:14,878
and a car drove up, a 504.
I clearly remember it was champagne color.

547
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:17,961
There was a guy in front of me,
he was in his car.

548
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:21,171
Four or five men got out of that car,
the one I told you about before,

549
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:23,691
and they started hitting this guy. Badly.

550
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:27,878
One of them pulled out a gun and I froze,
you know? I didn't know what to do.

551
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,737
They knocked him out or something,
put him in the car, and then...

552
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:33,211
the car took off speeding.

553
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:36,756
At that moment, I saw a planner
and a set of keys,

554
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,045
which I took to the police, of course,

555
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,025
and I also gave my statement.

556
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:47,289
And I think I'd seen one of them before,
I can't remember where.

557
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:50,045
But I'll do everything that I can

558
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:53,795
to clear up this case
and help in any way I can.

559
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,795
What we just saw
is a report that can help shed light

560
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,891
to the whereabouts of Mr. Bonaventura,

561
00:56:00,975 --> 00:56:03,503
who has been missing for over a week now.

562
00:56:03,586 --> 00:56:06,470
Is this another kidnapping?

563
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:09,336
This is his wife, Mrs. María Esther,

564
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:11,920
who's been living a real nightmare
since last week.

565
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:15,766
And this is Congressman Ernesto Segal,
candidate for Senator,

566
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,530
who, as a public official,
should be able to provide answers

567
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:21,795
to what is happening with this crime wave.
We'll be right back.

568
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:26,122
Give us our money back!

569
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:27,584
Asshole!

570
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,903
Son of a bitch!

571
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,075
Thief!

572
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,687
- Miss, who are you looking for?
- I'm looking for Mario.

573
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,083
Mario is not here.

574
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:09,295
- Will he be back soon?
- I don't know, he didn't tell me.

575
00:57:09,577 --> 00:57:11,648
I'm on my way. Okay.

576
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:13,166
- Judy.
- Yes.

577
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:16,920
I'm going to the supermarket to buy
a few things. Do we need anything?

578
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:19,211
- No, we're fine, ma'am. Thanks.
- Okay, good.

579
00:57:19,295 --> 00:57:21,490
Hi. You must be Beatriz, right?

580
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:23,586
- Yes.
- I'm Julieta, Pablo's sister.

581
00:57:24,795 --> 00:57:26,836
- Yes, sure. How are you, dear?
- Fine.

582
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,633
No, we don't need anything, we're good.

583
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:31,628
Okay, when Mario comes out
of the bathroom,

584
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:35,504
serve him lunch and tidy up his room
because it's a mess.

585
00:57:36,795 --> 00:57:39,184
Yes, ma'am. As soon as Mario comes back,
I'll serve him lunch.

586
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:42,053
- Okay. It was a pleasure.
- Likewise.

587
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:45,795
- Will you tell him I came by?
- Sure.

588
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,396
Xime, hi, can I talk to Pablo, please?

589
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:16,836
- He's not here, Mario.
- <i>Ximena, please.</i>

590
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,160
I'll tell him you called.

591
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:21,170
<i>Ximena, can you get him?
I know he's there! Tell him we...</i>

592
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:24,461
I'll tell him, Mario.
I have to go, I'm with the baby.

593
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:27,086
- <i>Ximena, please, tell him I'm at home!</i>
- Sure.

594
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,211
<i>Ximena, listen to...</i>

595
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,416
Pablo.

596
00:58:34,754 --> 00:58:36,086
Are you going to talk to me?

597
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,687
What happened with the Russian?
Why won't you talk to him?

598
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:42,420
Is that why you're upset?

599
00:58:42,504 --> 00:58:43,939
What did he do to you?

600
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:47,545
Pablo!

601
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:53,445
He's not doing well, you know?

602
00:59:54,376 --> 00:59:56,086
He was in jail for two years.

603
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,305
Good thing it was for stealing.

604
00:59:59,035 --> 01:00:00,990
You know what they do to rapists,
don't you?

605
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:02,254
Is that true?

606
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,670
Pedophiles get the worst treatment.

607
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,075
They become slaves.

608
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,914
It's not like you see in films,
where you belong to a group.

609
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:12,539
Inside, you're all alone!

610
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:15,217
It's every man for himself.

611
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:17,956
If you're new,
you have to fight everyone.

612
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:20,245
One by one, until you can't go on.

613
01:00:21,754 --> 01:00:23,220
The guard puts you in a cell,

614
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:25,665
and they come in and beat
the shit out of you, one by one...

615
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:27,836
until you can't get up.

616
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,137
The next day, the same thing happens.
Until you earn everyone's respect.

617
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,574
And you have to "asept" that,
there's no alternative.

618
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:38,874
- You have to what?
- "Asept" it.

619
01:00:39,754 --> 01:00:41,620
You must "asept" it. That's the way it is.

620
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,555
Yeah.

621
01:00:45,653 --> 01:00:49,314
"Accept," you moron!
Not "asept," "accept."

622
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:54,961
See? Do you want to end up like that?

623
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:56,545
Are you talking to me?

624
01:00:58,086 --> 01:00:59,211
Pass that joint, man.

625
01:01:15,878 --> 01:01:18,291
Well, guys, I'm calling it a night.

626
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:19,916
- Bye.
- Bye.

627
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:21,473
Do you want me to look after your car?

628
01:01:21,497 --> 01:01:25,028
Hey, Mario. What's up with Pablo?
We haven't seen him in a week.

629
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:30,298
- I don't know.
- What happened? Did you guys break up?

630
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:33,441
- Do you want me to drop you off?
- Great, man.

631
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:34,705
Mario, can you drop me off too?

632
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,336
Why are we knocking on this door?

633
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,670
Well, because TV3 News investigated

634
01:01:56,753 --> 01:01:59,628
and found out
that this is Mario Segal's home.

635
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:01,003
Who is Mario Segal?

636
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:05,461
Some people have testified seeing him
at the scene of the crime.

637
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:08,753
And we will stay here
until he talks to us.

638
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:44,920
Let's keep trying.

639
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:53,271
Mario David Segal?

640
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:55,753
What detergent do you use?

641
01:02:56,628 --> 01:02:58,336
What detergent do you use?

642
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,378
Because with the new Shine Ultra,
with only half as much soap,

643
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:05,628
your whites are even whiter
and your colors, even brighter!

644
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:06,878
Try Shine Ultra.

645
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:11,253
<i>Try Shine Ultra, it's cheaper
Try Shine Ultra, it lasts longer</i>

646
01:03:11,336 --> 01:03:12,336
<i>It lasts longer!</i>

647
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:14,628
<i>Try Shine Ultra, don't miss out</i>

648
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:19,045
<i>Shine Ultra, it's cheaper
Try Shine Ultra, it lasts longer</i>

649
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,420
<i>What detergent do you use?</i>

650
01:03:20,503 --> 01:03:23,711
<i>Because with the new Shine Ultra,
with only half as much soap,</i>

651
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:26,253
<i>your whites are even whiter

652
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:31,336
<i>Try Shine Ultra, it's cheaper
Try Shine Ultra, it lasts longer</i>

653
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,294
<i>Try Shine Ultra, we recommend it
Try Shine...</i>

654
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:40,170
<i>TV3 News brings you the latest news.</i>

655
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:42,336
<i>We are back.</i>

656
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,795
<i>On location, we have Fanny Mandelbaum
giving us the latest update.</i>

657
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:49,260
<i>- Over to you, Fanny.
- Thank you.</i>

658
01:03:49,345 --> 01:03:51,961
<i>We find ourselves at this empty lot,</i>

659
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:55,878
<i>where the body of José Luis Bonaventura
has been found.</i>

660
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,579
<i>Apparently, a group of young boys,
who were playing soccer...</i>

661
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:01,753
<i>Let's see if the camera can zoom in.
So, they were the ones who found him.</i>

662
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:05,968
<i>The corpse has been here
for about a week,</i>

663
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:09,432
<i>and according to the experts
who worked on it...</i>

664
01:04:12,253 --> 01:04:14,336
<i>He died instantly.</i>

665
01:04:15,949 --> 01:04:18,648
<i>said a weapon that was found
near the scene</i>

666
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:21,670
<i>is thought to be the murder weapon.</i>

667
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:25,795
<i>There are new suspects
that will be under investigation.</i>

668
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:31,336
<i>We'll stay here
and try to get new witnesses.</i>

669
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,856
Pablo, I can't take it anymore!
I can't keep seeing you like this.

670
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:38,170
I'm tired of being the loser
that deals with your moodiness here!

671
01:04:47,707 --> 01:04:49,586
Ximena, please, I can't.

672
01:04:50,526 --> 01:04:51,526
What?

673
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:53,920
You can't what, Pablo?

674
01:04:55,336 --> 01:04:56,588
What is it?

675
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:00,461
Please tell me. What happened to you?

676
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:03,878
Are you seeing someone else?

677
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,670
Is that it?

678
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,045
Do you want to break up?

679
01:05:08,128 --> 01:05:09,586
Don't be stupid.

680
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,086
What is it, then?

681
01:05:11,972 --> 01:05:14,586
You ignore me, it's as if I didn't exist.

682
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,961
What changed last week? I don't get it!

683
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:20,878
You came to see me dance, we had
a great time, we made plans together.

684
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:23,545
And now you're backing out,
shutting yourself away.

685
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,336
Why did you change your mind, Pablo?
I don't get it!

686
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:57,211
You're in a different zone.

687
01:05:57,295 --> 01:05:59,836
You didn't even pick up Valen
to go to the doctor's.

688
01:06:01,367 --> 01:06:03,795
Pablo! Is this about Italy?

689
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:05,841
Grow some balls, dude, talk to me!

690
01:06:05,865 --> 01:06:08,461
If you want to leave me, if you want
to break up, just say it!

691
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:12,586
Ximena, leave me alone.

692
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,253
Look, Juli, it's Mario.

693
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:50,378
- Get out of the car, asshole!
- Julieta, please calm down!

694
01:06:50,461 --> 01:06:53,086
"Calm down"?
I've been trying to reach you for a week!

695
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,920
What the fuck? Why do you do this to me?

696
01:06:55,003 --> 01:06:58,211
You never called! You think I didn't know
you were home the other day?

697
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:01,961
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
- Julieta, I don't have time for this now!

698
01:07:02,045 --> 01:07:03,836
Please, tell me where Pablo is.

699
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,711
Who told you to avoid me?

700
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:09,086
Just call me and end it so I can forget
about you! Who do you think you are, man?

701
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,128
Can you keep it down?

702
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:15,670
Sorry, but I have bigger problems
than you being in love with me.

703
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:19,545
In love with you? In your dreams.
I hate you! I hate you with all my heart.

704
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:22,503
You know what? Do whatever you want,
fuck whoever you want,

705
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:23,753
just stay away from me!

706
01:08:12,102 --> 01:08:13,102
Hello?

707
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,670
Finally! We haven't seen you in ages.

708
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,461
Juli, what's wrong? Are you okay?

709
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:34,217
I'm fine, Pablo. Go away.

710
01:09:00,253 --> 01:09:01,587
- Hello.
- Pablo!

711
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:04,502
Don't hang up! We have to talk.
It's urgent.

712
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:06,003
- Where are you?
- At the park.

713
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,503
Finally! You have no idea what happened.

714
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:20,211
"What happened"? You fucked my sister,
that's what happened.

715
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:21,503
Yeah, I heard!

716
01:09:23,795 --> 01:09:26,252
You piece of shit! You have no respect!

717
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:28,045
I gave my life for you!

718
01:09:28,628 --> 01:09:31,545
You have no values, just like your father!
You're corrupt, just like him!

719
01:09:31,628 --> 01:09:34,252
Man, just listen to me
for a second, it's important!

720
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,836
Why don't you tell us the truth?

721
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,127
Why don't you tell everybody
who you really are?

722
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:41,586
Fuck you, you motherfucker!
Tell them the truth, come on!

723
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:43,711
Tell them who you really are!

724
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:45,920
Tell them you're Congressman Segal's son!

725
01:09:46,003 --> 01:09:47,336
You're no kid from the street!

726
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,920
You're a self-hating Jew who steals
so you can have a few friends!

727
01:09:51,003 --> 01:09:52,670
Stop! Can you listen to me?

728
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:53,961
Get out of here, Russian!

729
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:57,337
- You have to hear what happened!
- Get out!

730
01:10:14,546 --> 01:10:17,966
<i>Criminologists!
Attention, criminologists...</i>

731
01:10:19,504 --> 01:10:20,391
Hold on!

732
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:24,123
<i>Criminologists!
Attention, criminologists...</i>

733
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:39,252
Take it easy, kid, turn around.

734
01:10:39,337 --> 01:10:40,545
What's going on, sir?

735
01:10:40,629 --> 01:10:42,127
- Turn around.
- But why?

736
01:10:42,212 --> 01:10:44,877
What the hell is going on?
I didn't do anything.

737
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:47,625
- Come on, turn around.
- What's the matter?

738
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:49,879
Turn around, damn it!

739
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:53,670
Ready?

740
01:10:55,511 --> 01:10:56,511
Get in.

741
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,670
Officer, like I said,

742
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:20,874
it was a misunderstanding
amongst friends, that's all.

743
01:11:21,212 --> 01:11:22,212
I'm a detective.

744
01:11:22,295 --> 01:11:25,666
You're not here because you fought
with your stupid boyfriend.

745
01:11:28,879 --> 01:11:30,254
Do you know this man?

746
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:34,962
No idea.

747
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:38,420
How about now?

748
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,170
No.

749
01:11:51,795 --> 01:11:52,842
And now?

750
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:11,161
José Luis Bonaventura,
businessman and politician.

751
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:13,087
Married, two daughters.

752
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,844
Lives on Libertador Avenue.

753
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,323
He likes parties and hookers.

754
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:24,629
How about this guy? Do you know him?

755
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,004
Stevie, the Fag.

756
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:30,712
Homosexual, drug lord, pedophile.

757
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:45,575
What are you doing here, Stevie?

758
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:48,795
I heard you got in a fight with Pablo
and wanted to check on you.

759
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:51,850
You know you boys are like sons to me.

760
01:12:53,254 --> 01:12:55,295
And I always worry about my children.

761
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:58,045
- Don't worry, everything's fine.
- It doesn't look like that.

762
01:12:58,129 --> 01:12:59,812
- Look at your face.
- It's nothing.

763
01:13:00,129 --> 01:13:01,129
Get in the car.

764
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,960
- I have to go home.
- I told you to get in the car!

765
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:14,795
Do you know what they say
around the neighborhood, kid?

766
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:19,377
That the Fag owed a lot of money
to Bonaventura,

767
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:21,087
and since he didn't want to pay,

768
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:23,212
he had him killed.

769
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:26,594
Do you know what else they say?

770
01:13:28,144 --> 01:13:31,377
That you and your friend
hang out a lot with the Fag

771
01:13:31,462 --> 01:13:33,172
and do some jobs for him.

772
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:38,674
You know how the story goes, right?

773
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,005
Do you know who you're dealing with?

774
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:49,957
Did you know the Fag is wanted
by the Uruguayan police

775
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:51,640
for trafficking and murder?

776
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:53,711
Who are you protecting?

777
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:56,086
Your friend, you think he'll keep quiet?

778
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,480
What do you think will happen
when both of you get caught?

779
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:01,834
Your friend's daddy
is going to help him out.

780
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:05,151
But a street kid from Palermo
will end his days in jail.

781
01:14:19,045 --> 01:14:20,920
You have two choices here.

782
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:24,754
Long and complicated, or short and easy.

783
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,920
Didn't I tell you that?
I said it multiple times.

784
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:29,795
- It has nothing to do with it!
- No?

785
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:32,422
You can't trust him.
See what he did to Julieta? I saw them.

786
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:34,688
What does that have to do
with his dad being a politician?

787
01:14:34,712 --> 01:14:36,586
Shut up, kids, the adults are talking.

788
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,377
Are you going to tell me
who did this to you? Was it Pablo?

789
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:41,045
No, it happened in a soccer match.

790
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:45,109
I thought it was him because he found out
about you and Julieta.

791
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:52,031
No, not at all.

792
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,194
You know everything, don't you?

793
01:14:56,504 --> 01:14:58,176
You know you can count on me.

794
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:01,920
You get special treatment from me,
Russian.

795
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:04,129
- Stop it, Stevie, I'm late.
- Wait!

796
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
Okay.

797
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:12,879
The short option is this:

798
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:15,377
you sign this confession,

799
01:15:15,462 --> 01:15:19,252
stating that you participated
in the murder of Bonaventura,

800
01:15:19,337 --> 01:15:23,000
but, mind you,
following Esteban Testaferro's orders.

801
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:27,377
You do some time, try to survive,

802
01:15:27,462 --> 01:15:30,962
and soon enough you're a free man.
You'll have your whole life ahead of you.

803
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Here.

804
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,698
If you want more, swing by the club.

805
01:15:38,412 --> 01:15:39,412
Mario...

806
01:15:40,295 --> 01:15:41,375
you know I love you, right?

807
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,719
If you are in trouble,
you can count on me.

808
01:15:47,962 --> 01:15:49,459
You are making things hard, kid.

809
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:51,734
This is the second option.

810
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,711
Today's the autopsy.

811
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:58,489
And tomorrow I'll have the dogs
chewing your balls off.

812
01:15:58,832 --> 01:16:02,098
Say goodbye to your family
and to your life. Get it?

813
01:16:02,337 --> 01:16:03,840
So, what the fuck is it going to be?

814
01:16:05,504 --> 01:16:07,479
I'm deeply sorry about the death
of this man.

815
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,670
But...

816
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,930
I have no idea what you're talking about.

817
01:16:16,837 --> 01:16:18,474
If you want to lock me up, go ahead.

818
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,870
If not, then let me go,
I have many things to do.

819
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,062
You walk out that door
and the offer's gone. Understood?

820
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:27,670
It's your call.

821
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:44,639
<i>Arrested because of an accident.</i>

822
01:16:54,795 --> 01:16:57,504
Your problem is that you
couldn't fuck her yourself!

823
01:16:58,962 --> 01:17:00,461
Do whatever you want!

824
01:17:00,545 --> 01:17:02,572
But if he shows up in my neighborhood,
I'll kill him.

825
01:17:02,596 --> 01:17:04,127
You're a fucking Nazi!

826
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:05,212
I'm out of here!

827
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:06,879
Son of a bitch. Get the fuck out.

828
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,114
You have to make a decision now, kid.

829
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,100
You walk out that door,
you lose the offer.

830
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:19,879
Excuse me...

831
01:17:20,707 --> 01:17:21,890
am I under arrest?

832
01:17:23,879 --> 01:17:26,917
It wouldn't do any good
getting the police involved in this.

833
01:17:27,337 --> 01:17:28,462
What's more...

834
01:17:29,754 --> 01:17:33,212
I think Ernesto
would disapprove of your actions.

835
01:17:34,379 --> 01:17:35,379
What?

836
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:40,461
- Where do you get...
- Not Valeria, or Betty or Julieta! Get it?

837
01:17:40,545 --> 01:17:42,469
Sealed lips, are we clear?

838
01:17:52,295 --> 01:17:53,545
Here, kid.

839
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,739
Now, don't be shy.

840
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:06,045
Now go home and take care.

841
01:18:33,212 --> 01:18:36,504
Ximena!

842
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:39,962
Ximena!

843
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,198
Where is she?

844
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:47,627
Beba, I'm begging you.
You know I love her more than anything!

845
01:18:47,712 --> 01:18:50,711
I know we fight a lot,
but that doesn't mean I don't love her.

846
01:18:50,795 --> 01:18:54,157
You, more than anyone,
should know I'd give my life for her!

847
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,631
It's my family! My woman, my daughter!

848
01:18:57,715 --> 01:19:00,920
I know you love her in your own way,
I'm sure of that!

849
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:03,420
But she packed and left.
She's going to Italy.

850
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:07,670
And she didn't leave an address,
so that you couldn't find her. Okay?

851
01:19:07,754 --> 01:19:11,837
- Please tell me it's not true, Beba.
- Do you want to know something?

852
01:19:13,212 --> 01:19:17,649
Although I think you're a fucking bum
and a lousy father,

853
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:19,587
I do believe you love her.

854
01:19:20,295 --> 01:19:23,879
And I'm scared of her going
to another country alone with the baby.

855
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:26,260
Please, go get her.

856
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,371
Find her, please. Okay?

857
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,082
<i>I need to get high.
Everything's going to be okay.</i>

858
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:54,444
<i>No, just a bit more. Okay.</i>

859
01:19:54,774 --> 01:19:59,242
<i>Just a bit more
and everything's going to be okay.</i>

860
01:19:59,344 --> 01:20:01,489
<i>I... It's not my fault.</i>

861
01:20:01,574 --> 01:20:02,787
<i>I'm fine.</i>

862
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:05,980
<i>Nothing will happen to me.</i>

863
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:10,600
<i>I'm fine. I... It wasn't my fault.
Julieta, it's your fault that...</i>

864
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:13,254
<i>One more.</i>

865
01:20:13,493 --> 01:20:15,959
<i>One, two, three. Done.</i>

866
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:21,087
<i>I'm fine now. Just one more. I'm fine.</i>

867
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,211
<i>Everything's going to be fine.</i>

868
01:20:23,295 --> 01:20:27,827
<i>Everything will be okay. I'm fine.
It wasn't my fault.</i>

869
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:32,212
<i>Everything will be okay because...
Everything...</i>

870
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:53,545
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

871
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:56,301
- Get out of here before I kill you!
- Stop!

872
01:20:56,415 --> 01:21:00,600
Walk! Out! I told you to leave! Come on!

873
01:21:31,795 --> 01:21:32,795
Ximena!

874
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:34,337
Xime, are you there?

875
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,732
Ximena, I got scared.

876
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,224
But I made up my mind. You are my girl.

877
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:55,670
That's it.

878
01:21:56,295 --> 01:21:57,795
Let's get the fuck out of here.

879
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,754
- Juli, are you okay?
- What happened with Mario?

880
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:38,535
What happened?

881
01:22:49,074 --> 01:22:51,462
<i>Hell</i>

882
01:22:52,782 --> 01:22:55,029
<i>Anguish</i>

883
01:22:56,428 --> 01:22:58,055
<i>Reset</i>

884
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:01,867
<i>Reset</i>

885
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:06,943
<i>I fade into shadows</i>

886
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,166
<i>I fall into my own trap</i>

887
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:13,893
<i>I fight against this anguish</i>

888
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:17,312
<i>I change my role in the middle of the game</i>

889
01:23:17,474 --> 01:23:18,934
<i>Countdown</i>

890
01:23:19,103 --> 01:23:21,321
<i>Skin and bones activate</i>

891
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:24,937
<i>I turn the key, I change time</i>

892
01:23:53,665 --> 01:23:55,800
<i>Hell</i>

893
01:23:57,224 --> 01:23:59,527
<i>Anguish</i>

894
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:02,504
<i>Reset</i>

895
01:24:04,265 --> 01:24:06,064
<i>Reset</i>

896
01:24:07,425 --> 01:24:10,796
<i>I deactivate my eyelids</i>

897
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:14,419
<i>I activate my dream</i>

898
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:18,175
<i>I see myself upside down in the mirror</i>

899
01:24:18,272 --> 01:24:21,783
<i>I dream of science fiction
I sweat, I get irritated</i>

900
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,412
<i>I find danger...</i>

901
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:25,295
You never know with women.

902
01:24:25,379 --> 01:24:28,127
You'd think they're easy,
but they're smarter than us.

903
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:30,129
No, man, but this isn't just any girl.

904
01:24:30,754 --> 01:24:34,920
This is a girl you'd marry forever,
you know?

905
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,073
Can you imagine
how our kids would look like, man?

906
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,724
They'd be beautiful, just like her!

907
01:24:41,795 --> 01:24:44,627
That's it, man. She's smart, she's sweet.

908
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:47,587
And I blew it! Because I'm an idiot!

909
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,489
Just tell her you love her
and she'll forgive you.

910
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,879
No, this time I really fucked it up, man.

911
01:24:54,712 --> 01:24:59,420
But I swear I'd do anything
to have her with me now, man.

912
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:01,002
She's an angel. You know?

913
01:25:01,087 --> 01:25:03,587
She was crazy about me
and I fucked it up, as always.

914
01:25:04,962 --> 01:25:07,752
My friends, my family, my neighborhood.
I'm all alone.

915
01:25:07,837 --> 01:25:09,837
Are you going to try it or not?

916
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:14,586
You asked me how I was doing, so...

917
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:17,461
I don't need to know about your life!
I'm not a therapist.

918
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,190
Try it, pay me and get out!

919
01:25:20,504 --> 01:25:23,795
Don't be a drag!
Come on, do it and get out!

920
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:50,545
Julieta?

921
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,711
Hey, sissy.

922
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:16,211
Get out of here, Russian,
before there's trouble.

923
01:26:16,295 --> 01:26:20,618
Haven't you been telling everyone
you'll kick my ass, faggot? So?

924
01:26:21,027 --> 01:26:24,604
Here I am! Are you backing off now?
Faggot!

925
01:26:37,265 --> 01:26:39,545
- Cut it out, man!
- Come on!

926
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:42,212
It's their problem.

927
01:28:08,337 --> 01:28:09,337
Come on, kid.

928
01:28:10,212 --> 01:28:11,453
Someone is here for you.

929
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:48,937
How are you, Mario?

930
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,693
Mario, I...

931
01:29:00,837 --> 01:29:05,545
I've always tried to guide you
in the best way that I could.

932
01:29:06,754 --> 01:29:08,712
But... no, it's not that, it's that...

933
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,219
I'm not blaming you for anything.

934
01:29:13,379 --> 01:29:17,906
I can imagine how much you've suffered
because of my absence...

935
01:29:20,004 --> 01:29:21,233
and my ways.

936
01:29:24,045 --> 01:29:26,437
But there's something
you need to understand, Mario.

937
01:29:28,212 --> 01:29:29,754
I'm on your side.

938
01:29:31,212 --> 01:29:34,108
I will never be against you.

939
01:29:36,837 --> 01:29:37,995
Mario, I...

940
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,629
At times, I feel
like I have lots of strength left,

941
01:29:43,582 --> 01:29:45,754
and at others,
I feel like I've reached my limit.

942
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:48,578
And maybe we don't have
much time left together, Mario.

943
01:29:49,837 --> 01:29:52,270
Your achievements are also mine.

944
01:29:56,879 --> 01:29:58,920
I always quote your grandfather.

945
01:30:01,545 --> 01:30:03,125
Well, he used to say...

946
01:30:04,462 --> 01:30:06,920
that we must use all our capacity

947
01:30:07,004 --> 01:30:10,130
to understand
those who are lost or confused.

948
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:13,254
And I didn't see it.

949
01:30:15,306 --> 01:30:17,045
I didn't see you were confused.

950
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,879
That you were lost in the storm.

951
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:24,776
Or maybe you felt like you didn't belong,
like you didn't have a family.

952
01:30:26,962 --> 01:30:28,379
But that's not true, Mario.

953
01:30:29,129 --> 01:30:30,462
You belong to this family.

954
01:30:31,504 --> 01:30:34,545
You have me. I'm not the best father,

955
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:38,045
but you also have
your sister and your mother.

956
01:30:39,545 --> 01:30:43,453
They're also your family and you can turn
to them when you're in need.

957
01:30:46,545 --> 01:30:47,587
Mario...

958
01:30:48,879 --> 01:30:50,004
family...

959
01:30:51,337 --> 01:30:52,379
comes first.

960
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:55,254
And I, Mario...

961
01:30:56,254 --> 01:30:58,795
Mario, I love you very much.

962
01:30:58,879 --> 01:31:00,635
You have to understand that.

963
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:06,587
Mario!

964
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,212
You know what, Mario?

965
01:31:11,295 --> 01:31:13,573
I believe in you more
than you believe in yourself.

966
01:31:15,962 --> 01:31:17,004
Mario.

967
01:31:20,337 --> 01:31:21,379
Mario...

968
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:25,295
Mario...

969
01:31:28,545 --> 01:31:29,587
Mario.

970
01:31:30,504 --> 01:31:33,586
If you need me, call me.

971
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:36,837
Just say, "Hey, Dad,
I need to talk to you."

972
01:31:39,212 --> 01:31:40,420
Come on, Mario.

973
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:42,129
Come on.

974
01:32:09,004 --> 01:32:10,170
Dad.

975
01:32:12,045 --> 01:32:13,417
You don't know who I am.

976
01:32:34,212 --> 01:32:35,385
Son, you have to sign.

977
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:44,474
Can I at least know what I'm signing?

978
01:32:51,879 --> 01:32:57,086
You are signing a statement saying
that you were taken against your will

979
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:00,013
and forced to witness
the murder of Bonaventura.

980
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:06,073
- What about Pablo?
- Your friend will be charged with murder,

981
01:33:06,157 --> 01:33:08,504
stating that he was under the orders
of Esteban Testaferro.

982
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:13,627
But he was forced to do it, he shot him
because he didn't have a choice.

983
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:15,748
- I want that to be clear.
- Mario,

984
01:33:15,962 --> 01:33:18,618
what the police want is Testaferro
on a silver platter.

985
01:33:18,962 --> 01:33:21,711
Your friend will just be an accomplice.

986
01:33:21,795 --> 01:33:27,627
He'll have a better chance
of parole in a few months.

987
01:33:27,712 --> 01:33:32,004
But he wasn't an accomplice.
He was forced! He did it to save my life!

988
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:35,629
If that's the case, now you're saving his.

989
01:33:36,295 --> 01:33:38,209
Pablo's prints were all over the gun.

990
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:41,920
If you don't sign this,
he'll be going away for life.

991
01:33:59,962 --> 01:34:01,337
Pablo will hate me.

992
01:35:05,123 --> 01:35:06,132
How awful...

993
01:35:20,004 --> 01:35:21,170
What do you want, Mario?

994
01:35:22,962 --> 01:35:24,587
I need to talk to you, Juli.

995
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:28,532
I know what happened.
I understand your reaction now.

996
01:35:30,462 --> 01:35:33,377
But it made me realize
that what we had was like a dream.

997
01:35:33,462 --> 01:35:35,515
I'm over it now. We can be friends.

998
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:40,462
I thought I was in love with you.

999
01:35:41,212 --> 01:35:43,493
And I'm an idiot,
so I thought you'd fall in love with me.

1000
01:35:44,545 --> 01:35:47,281
- I am in love with you.
- What?

1001
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:53,212
Juli, I've never been
in so much trouble before.

1002
01:35:54,045 --> 01:35:57,551
I've never been so confused.
But things are clearing up now.

1003
01:35:57,997 --> 01:35:59,545
Now's not the time, Mario.

1004
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,752
We can talk later...

1005
01:36:00,837 --> 01:36:02,077
Juli, please, just hear me out.

1006
01:36:03,045 --> 01:36:06,370
I want to apologize for what I did,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1007
01:36:08,712 --> 01:36:10,170
I love you very much.

1008
01:36:10,254 --> 01:36:12,912
Russian, I forgive you,
you don't have to say all this.

1009
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,202
Please, don't call me "Russian."

1010
01:36:17,337 --> 01:36:20,877
I know it's too late, I know I messed up,
but give me a chance.

1011
01:36:20,962 --> 01:36:23,295
I can't think of you as a friend.

1012
01:36:23,379 --> 01:36:24,712
You're much more than that.

1013
01:36:25,587 --> 01:36:28,683
You're unique.
It hurts not being able to see you.

1014
01:36:32,045 --> 01:36:34,001
With you, I feel like I belong somewhere.

1015
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,170
I can't.

1016
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:42,962
Can't what?

1017
01:36:46,587 --> 01:36:48,452
I can't imagine being without you.

1018
01:37:01,224 --> 01:37:02,984
<i>Wants to give you a kiss.
Give her a kiss.</i>

1019
01:37:03,545 --> 01:37:04,920
And one for me? A kiss?

1020
01:37:06,254 --> 01:37:09,462
<i>With a big hug...</i>

1021
01:37:10,545 --> 01:37:13,002
Who is this? What about the lion?

1022
01:37:13,087 --> 01:37:14,087
Hello?

1023
01:37:15,087 --> 01:37:16,087
Who?

1024
01:37:19,004 --> 01:37:21,586
- Just a minute, please.
- the nose.

1025
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:25,010
Pablo. The cops are outside.
They're asking about you.

1026
01:37:28,879 --> 01:37:30,087
What do I tell them?

1027
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:35,002
Xime, listen carefully.

1028
01:37:35,087 --> 01:37:37,627
This is bad.
I need to run before they come in.

1029
01:37:37,712 --> 01:37:41,086
And we have to leave now!
Take everything you need.

1030
01:37:41,170 --> 01:37:43,211
- I'm going to get some money.
- What is it?

1031
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:45,670
- Xime!
- Where are you going? Don't go now, Pablo.

1032
01:37:45,754 --> 01:37:49,406
Ximena, go to Enrique's. I'll call you
and tell you where to meet me.

1033
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:28,961
Wait for Ximena here. Keep this safe.

1034
01:38:29,045 --> 01:38:32,211
Take her and Valen to Retiro station
and buy two tickets to anywhere.

1035
01:38:32,295 --> 01:38:33,920
Don't leave until I get there.

1036
01:38:34,004 --> 01:38:35,795
- I'm taking the motorcycle.
- Okay.

1037
01:38:36,837 --> 01:38:38,216
Careful with the Russian.

1038
01:39:21,879 --> 01:39:23,172
Where's Daddy?

1039
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:27,754
No!

1040
01:41:40,658 --> 01:41:47,259
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN

1041
01:41:52,087 --> 01:41:54,212
<i>You make me fall for you</i>

1042
01:41:55,045 --> 01:41:57,879
<i>You make me go crazy</i>

1043
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:02,868
<i>You are my girl, my illegal girl</i>

1044
01:42:03,212 --> 01:42:07,930
<i>You are like a drug</i>

1045
01:42:09,004 --> 01:42:10,897
<i>You make me fall for you</i>

1046
01:42:11,795 --> 01:42:15,127
<i>You make me go crazy</i>

1047
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:19,247
<i>You are my girl, my illegal girl</i>

1048
01:42:21,754 --> 01:42:23,251
Cumbia!

1049
01:42:27,295 --> 01:42:29,844
<i>With Damas Gratis!</i>

1050
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,861
<i>Feel it, baby!</i>
