Directed by

13
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:32,167
For centuries, men have been
trying to produce gold artificially...

14
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,841
Because gold is the blessing
and the curse of this world...

15
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:46,347
For gold, there is war between
the clans, the tribes, the peoples...

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:55,182
For gold, people betray,
pursue and kill each other...

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,299
So, tonight at 7:00,

18
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,461
the crucial experiment
will be conducted.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,540
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,638
- Who will be there?
- Professor Achenbach

21
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,339
and his assistant, Engineer Holk...

22
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,073
and me.

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,808
Becker.

24
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,277
You know exactly
what you've got to do.

25
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,354
Yes.

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,148
How long will you need?

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,418
About...

28
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,553
two minutes.

29
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,095
We'll make sure that,
shortly before 7:00,

30
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,261
you'll be alone in the laboratory
for two minutes.

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,609
Here.

32
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,348
There you go.

33
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,144
But be careful.

34
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,579
What's the matter?

35
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:03,116
But what if the professor
or Holk is--

36
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,163
Are you related
to those gentlemen?

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,824
- No, I'm not, but--
- Well, then.

38
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,835
Don't worry, Becker.

39
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,065
Nobody will be harmed.

40
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,141
The effect isn't that strong.

41
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,039
- It isn't?
- Sure.

42
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,602
All we're interested in
is that the experiment fails.

43
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,577
Becker!

44
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,846
Pull yourself together, all right?

45
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,321
Yes. I just meant to ask.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,559
See.

47
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,462
Take care, boy.

48
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,976
It will work out fine.

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,062
Becker?

52
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,071
- Good evening, Professor.
- So, how are you?

53
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,543
Everything all right?

54
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,114
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,306
- The pump installation?
- I checked it.

56
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,353
- The grounding switches?
- They're in place, Professor.

57
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,753
- What about the electricity?
- It's ordered for 7:00.

58
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,084
Very good.

59
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,890
You're surely glad, Becker,
that we're finally ready.

60
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,029
Yes, sure.

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,003
You've been working
hard enough recently.

62
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,672
Where's Holk?

63
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,615
- Mr. Holk?
- Yes?

64
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,405
Someone wants to
urgently speak with you.

65
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,977
- Yes?
- Brinkmann, from the press.

66
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,055
I have a few questions for you.

67
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,614
You come at the most inconvenient time,
I have no time right now.

68
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,025
- Maybe you'll come back tomorrow.
- I'm afraid it can't wait, sir.

69
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,098
I need some information about the
experiment and Professor Achenbach.

70
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,360
You know he never talks about his work.

71
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,595
It won't take you very long.

72
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,764
All right, five minutes. Go ahead,
what do you want to know?

73
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,408
Professor,
there's a phone call for you.

74
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,110
Who is it?

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,949
A certain Professor Lundborg.

76
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,954
Lundborg?

77
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,184
I don't know him.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,226
From Stockholm.

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,720
- From Stockholm?
- Yes, Professor.

80
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,170
Yes? Achenbach here.

81
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,249
My apologies for disturbing you,
my dear colleague.

82
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,842
I happen to be in Berlin
and didn't want to miss--

83
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,255
Pardon?

84
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,823
From Stockholm?

85
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,358
No, no. I'm in Berlin.

86
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,230
It would be best
if you called me again tomorrow.

87
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,776
Hello? Hello, dear colleague,
just one important question.

88
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,504
Yes?

89
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,341
Yes, yes.

90
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,787
We can discuss this
face-to-face tomorrow.

91
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,185
I have to end this call.

92
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,586
Until tomorrow, then.

93
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,066
- Barely two minutes.
- Let's hope that was enough.

94
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,828
Here, let me repeat it.

95
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,564
Transformation of lead into gold
by atomic fragmentation.

96
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,469
Flame shots
of up to 50 million volts--

97
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,269
Five million volts, sir.

98
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,502
Don't throw the millions
around like that.

99
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,239
And please stress

100
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,976
that this is not some
kind of gold factory,

101
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,417
- but a purely scientific experiment.
- Of course.

102
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,853
- Good-bye.
- Thank you very much.

103
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,084
- Good luck.
- Yes, thanks.

104

HIGH VOLTAGE - CAUTION!
MORTAL DANGER

105
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,958
Excuse me, Professor. There was
a man from the press outside,

106
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,093
and I had to tell him a little bit.

107
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,866
- I see.
- Good evening, Professor.

108
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,941
Come on, let's start.

109
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,971
You already connected
the load switch, Professor.

110
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,045
Yes, I did.

111
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,011
- May I switch over?
- Yes.

112
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,240
For now, the gentlemen
are right to have their doubts.

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,151
Our experiments have
only been successful on paper thus far.

114
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,224
But Professor,
how can you say that?

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,889
So we must prove it.

116
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,587
Today!

117
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,857
It will work out.
I feel it.

118
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,832
Stop, one moment, please.
Let me out.

119
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,402
Good night.

120
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,274
Turn on the machines.

121
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,248
Yes, I'll turn them on.

122
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,519
All right.

123
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,520
What's wrong with Becker today?

124
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,715
Becker?

125
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,452
He's probably just a little excited.
I can understand him.

126
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,894
To be honest, Professor,
I've got some stage fright myself.

127
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,264
Attention, Holk. Now.

128
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,569
Becker?

129
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,664
Turn on the surge generators.

130
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,402
But in the right order!

131
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,978
Yes, Mr. Holk.

132
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,727
Ready.

133
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,529
Ready.

134
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,592
Now.

135
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,482
Ready.

136
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,719
Ready.

137
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,954
Now.

138
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,169
Professor!

139
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,713
Professor!

140
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,707
Professor!

141
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,149
What's the matter, Becker?

142
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,120
What's the matter? Speak up!

143
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,662
Don't!

144
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,501
WERNER HOLK, ACCIDENT

145
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,577
Unfortunately,
he's lost a lot of blood.

146
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,704
Everything is prepared
for the blood transfusion, Doctor.

147
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,085
- Where's the blood donor?
- He'll be here soon.

148
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,422
It's high time

149
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,185
if the blood transfusion
is to be successful.

150
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,527
His pulse is weak,

151
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,562
irregular and accelerated.

152
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,391
Well, let's get everything ready.

153
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,797
Doctor?

154
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,032
The patient's fiancée is outside.

155
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,609
So? You can't let visitors in to
a seriously injured patient now!

156
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,733
Certainly not.

157
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,643
But she asks to be
taken as blood donor.

158
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,215
- Yes?
- Yes.

159
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,306
Did you examine her?
Blood type A?

160
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,717
Yes, sir. Blood type A
and in perfect health.

161
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,948
Makes an excellent impression.

162
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,983
I think we cannot deny this
to the young lady.

163
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,461
She pleaded for it.

164
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,723
Very well.

165
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,664
Bring her in.
But hurry!

166
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,268
Please come in.
The doctor has agreed.

167
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,740
- Are you scared?
- No.

168
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,145
That's good.

169
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,559
- Doctor, the lady is here.
- Fine.

170
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,630
Come in.
There's not a minute to lose.

171
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,425
Good afternoon, Mrs. Schäfermann.
Is Mr. Holk at home?

172
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,027
Werner.

173
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,294
Margit.

174
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,806
Good afternoon.

175
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,668
Your eyes are so clear
and shining today.

176
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,279
- You've been brooding again.
- Don't be so strict with me.

177
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,212
You've been reading those old
newspaper clippings once again.

178
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,219
Yes, I have.

179
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,119
What else can I do?

180
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,484
- I'll never get rid of that story.
- But, Werner--

181
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,393
I know what you're
about to say, Margit.

182
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,797
It's been a long time and people
don't think about it anymore.

183
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,304
Sadly enough.

184
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,033
Here, read this.
There it is in black and white.

185
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,242
"Irresponsible negligence.

186
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,904
Boundless dilettantism."

187
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,549
And I'm supposed to let
that hang on Achenbach?

188
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,389
No.

189
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,391
Not me.

190
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,596
He can't defend
himself anymore.

191
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,325
He's not here anymore.

192
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,632
But I'm still here.

193
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,935
It was no accident.
It was a malicious crime.

194
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,636
But I'll get those bastards.

195
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,372
I'll never forget the face
of that Becker.

196
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,713
He knew about the dirty trick.

197
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,445
He wanted to say something,
but then it was over.

198
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,785
Then came the unholy mess.

199
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,595
Margit?

200
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,699
- What time is it?
- Almost 5:00.

201
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,565
- I'm going back to the plant.
- But Werner, I just arrived.

202
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,235
I know you don't have it easy
with me at the moment, Margit.

203
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,003
You just need a little more patience, right?

204
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,012
- Then I'll go back home.
- No.

205
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,541
You should stay here and wait for me.

206
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,621
I'll be back soon.

207
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,652
Looks monstrous, doesn't it?

208
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,686
What are you looking for?

209
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,330
The gold?

210
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,268
None there.

211
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,868
They didn't succeed,
the two of them.

212
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,742
Maybe it's for the better.

213
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,515
The lead.

214
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,120
Compromised. That's how they did it.

215
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,294
You.

216
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,101
There was something in the lead.

217
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,835
Do you understand that, man?

218
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,207
Nope.

219
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,575
"Nope."

220
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,082
Well, there's no way you could.

221
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,910
Werner?

222
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,108
There are two gentlemen
waiting for you.

223
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,685
- Who?
- I don't know them.

224
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,685
They insisted on speaking to you.

225
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,550
Brann.

226
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,628
Vesitsch.

227
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,026
Holk.

228
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,360
Please take a seat.

229
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,869
Do you mind me smoking,
Mr. Holk?

230
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,102
No, no, I like a smoky atmosphere.

231
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,275
What can I do for you?

232
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,043
Have you ever heard
the name Wills, Mr. Holk?

233
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,123
Wills.

234
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,521
Yes, I know that name.

235
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,094
Wills owns steel
and lead mines, doesn't he?

236
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,254
- Yes, yes. That's him.
- Exactly.

237
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,431
And?

238
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,692
Perhaps you'll find it interesting

239
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,367
that for years Mr. Wills
has been doing

240
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,030
experiments similar to you

241
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:27,941
and the unfortunately deceased
Professor Achenbach.

242
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,339
That's very interesting.

243
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,179
Yes, yes. In the
practical basis, at any rate.

244
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,321
What does that mean,
practical foundation?

245
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,889
What do you mean?

246
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,959
Is he opening
a ducat factory, or what?

247
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,959
Maybe.

248
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,859
In any case--

249
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,761
and that's why we're here--

250
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,664
Mr. Wills wishes to meet you.

251
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,759
He wants you to work for him.

252
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,073
And what that means for you--

253
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,768
Well, you can guess.

254
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,846
It's a lucky chance for you.

255
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,576
Similar experiments...

256
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,619
- with atomic fragmentation?
- Yes.

257
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,851
If you want to see the plans
of the Wills plant...

258
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,950
- Let me see.
- There you are.

259
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,694
But that's Achenbach's apparatus.

260
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:31,834
With a few minor changes,
or, more precisely, some errors.

261
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,946
You know I owe it to a mere
coincidence that I'm still alive.

262
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,148
- Yes. We heard about the accident.
- We were sorry to hear about it.

263
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,057
But for you and Mr. Wills,
that accident was quite opportune.

264
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,286
How's that?

265
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,193
If Achenbach and I
had been successful,

266
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,665
we would have gotten there
ahead of you.

267
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,928
That's true.

268
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,767
- Aha.
- Pardon?

269
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:14,747
Well, I'm very interested
in meeting Mr. Wills.

270
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm curious about
what he will suggest to me.

271
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,216
- When can you leave, Mr. Holk?
- Anytime.

272
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,725
Mr. Wills is currently on board
his yacht in the North Sea.

273
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,352
Your train leaves tonight at 9:00.

274
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,261
In Bremerhaven, a seaplane
will be waiting for you.

275
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,992
- Here.
- Thank you.

276
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,897
Well.

277
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,971
Tomorrow morning at 10:00,
you'll meet Mr. Wills.

278
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,698
Excellent.

279
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,433
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

280
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,271
The same from me.

281
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,973
Thank you. Well.

282
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,231
Margit?

283
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,066
Margit!

284
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,067
Now I've got them.

285
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,400
Do you know who these
two gentlemen were?

286
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,473
Two very dangerous fellows.

287
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,769
- Dangerous, that one.
- That's my impression, too.

288
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,775
- We need to send a telegraph.
- Nonsense.

289
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,846
Wills has handled
far more dangerous guys.

290
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,846
Nevertheless. Just in case.

291
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,678
But they're only minions, these two.

292
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,154
Common henchmen.

293
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,881
I'm not interested in them.

294
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,892
But in the man
who's behind them, John Wills.

295
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,559
Have you ever heard
of that noble gentleman?

296
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,290
John Wills.

297
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,260
I can't be mistaken,
I just have the feeling.

298
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,995
That's the bloke...

299
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,663
Who has the death of our professor
on his conscience.

300
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,570
I want to meet him.

301
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,267
Werner.

302
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,339
What's the matter?

303
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,211
Little Margit.

304
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,546
Are you scared?

305
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,449
Scared for me?

306
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,453
But I must go, child.

307
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,990
You'll understand that.

308
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,218
I know, Werner.

309
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,352
Otherwise, you won't be able
to find any peace of mind.

310
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,756
I'll be back soon.

311
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,332
You.

312
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,059
And I'm carrying you
with me always.

313
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,671
Here.

314
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,773
You're always with me.

315
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,771
Blood in my blood.

316
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,814
Gosh!
What a pretentious vessel!

317
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,984
I prefer this little boat here.

318
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,716
A pleasure cruise
on a yacht like this--

319
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,451
nothing to sneeze at.

320
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,355
Whether this is going to be
a pleasure...

321
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,363
remains to be seen.

322
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,973
- Good morning.
- Mr. Wills welcomes you, Mr. Holk.

323
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,542
May I show you to your cabin?

324
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,279
- I'd like to speak to Mr. Wills now.
- Very well.

325
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,826
Hello, Lüders.

326
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,557
Hello, Lüders. Willi!

327
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,261
Yes?

328
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,771
Man alive,
what are you doing here?

329
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,737
Excuse me,
but you must be mistaken.

330
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,638
But, Willi.

331
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,309
Old boy!

332
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,310
Don't you recognize me?

333
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,039
Holk. Werner Holk.

334
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,549
- As students. We were together--
- Excuse me, but you're mistaken.

335
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,347
My name is Jenkins.

336
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,482
Jenkins. Unbelievable.

337
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,823
Excuse me,
what's that gentleman's name?

338
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,093
Jenkins. Our first mate.

339
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,099
Is he?
And you know that for sure?

340
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,828
But of course.

341
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,833
That's the way?

342
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,951
One moment, please.
I'll tell Mr. Wills you're here.

343
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,523
Yes. Thank you.

344
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,436
...the consortium makes the
release of mining rights,

345
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,440
dependent on the decision
of the ministry--

346
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,511
- Excuse me, Mr. Wills.
- Yes?

347
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,273
- Mr. Holk.
- Show him in.

348
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,774
Mr. Wills asks you to come in.

349
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,916
May I take your coat?

350
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,489
...departure: immediately. Stop.

351
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,564
Surveillance of the gold mine
syndicate necessary. Stop.

352
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,123
- Good morning.
- One moment, please.

353
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,466
Stop.
Murphy seems incapable. Stop.

354
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,098
General power of attorney
on its way by air mail.

355
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,938
Signature Wills.

356
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:14,806
Next.

357
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,880
Cable to Gold Mine Syndicate,
Cape Town.

358
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,210
General Manager Murphy.

359
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,776
Radio report about monthly yield
not satisfying. Stop.

360
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:30,224
Please offer precise suggestions
for increase in production.

361
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,662
Send as flash transmission via radio.

362
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,599
Next.

363
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,998
Cable to International Lloyds, London.

364
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,560
Agree in principle with supplier
contract as a whole. Stop.

365
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,073
Following changes
are imperative. Stop.

366
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,006
To point sixteen.

367
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,544
- Establishment of regular London--
- Nah!

368
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,414
Call me when you're ready!

369
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,754
Mr. Holk?

370
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,094
Please.

371
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,935
My apologies. I didn't know
your time was so precious.

372
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,062
My time? No.
But I thought you were in a hurry.

373
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,471
Why else would you
fly me in by airplane?

374
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,100
Otherwise, I could have
leisurely paddled up here.

375
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,507
We'll continue later.

376
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,113
Please tell Jenkins
full speed ahead to Scotland.

377
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,521
No, no, stop, my dear man.
Hold your full speed back a while.

378
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,088
We haven't gotten
that far yet, Mr. Wills.

379
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,864
I see.

380
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,434
We're going.

381
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,168
Then I'll have to pull
the emergency brake.

382
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,604
I'm glad to find you
in such a cheerful mood.

383
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,835
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks. Not right now.

384
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,536
My dear Mr. Holk,
I've got a proposition for you.

385
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,673
You will continue
your experiments in my plant,

386
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,410
we will quickly come to
an agreement

387
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,384
and for your collaboration,
I will offer you--

388
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,235
Your conditions are
so tempting, Mr. Wills,

389
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,606
that you'd have to be an idiot...

390
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,710
to say no.

391
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,439
- Right!
- One moment.

392
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,913
However...

393
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,110
perhaps I am just such an idiot.

394
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,379
What?

395
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,818
Yes, yes.

396
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,651
- Would you tell me, Mr. Wills...
- Go on.

397
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,594
How did Achenbach's procedure

398
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,824
actually come into your hands?

399
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,034
That's my business.

400
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,267
- Is it?
- Yes.

401
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,002
That means, you have--

402
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,512
- I don't want to be disturbed!
- But it's very important.

403
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,309
Then give it to me.

404
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,486
WILLS, YACHT <i>SAVARONA.</i>

405
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,919
HOLK SUSPECTS CONNECTION
WITH ACHENBACH. STOP.

406
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,991
CAUTION ADVISED. BRANN.

407
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,973
So, your decision, please.

408
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,700
What if I say no?

409
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,375
That would be very imprudent of you.

410
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,970
You can presume that
I will keep the only person

411
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,540
posing a real competition
to my work, at my side

412
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,278
under all circumstances.

413
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,554
So that's how it is.

414
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,252
Then let's call things as they are.
You're threatening me.

415
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,329
No. You'll just be,
for an indefinite period of time,

416
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,329
my guest, in my castle.

417
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,536
So, your decision, Mr. Holk?

418
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,111
I'll work.

419
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,845
That's very wise of you.

420
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,919
In which cabin is Mr. Holk?

421
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,991
- Cabin 18.
- So, Cabin 18.

422
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,889
- We'll meet at lunch.
- Yes.

423
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,929
Mr. Holk is to be kept
under constant surveillance.

424
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,836
But discreetly.

425
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,567
And you will arrange
for everything else.

426
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,665
Yes, Mr. Wills.

427
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,623
Ah, the double.

428
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,131
- Why are you snooping around here?
- Hush. Be quiet.

429
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,533
You're under surveillance.

430
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,806
Mr. Lüders?

431
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,769
Lüders!

432
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,668
So you are good old Willi!

433
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,047
Why did you act up like that,
earlier on?

434
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,780
Well, my dear man.
Mr. Lüders is--

435
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,515
- My name is Jenkins.
- Yes, you told me that.

436
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,795
For all I care, call yourself Lord Nelson.
But why the nonsense?

437
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,058
No nonsense. Here. Look.

438
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,794
Charlie Jenkins, citizen of Cuba.

439
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,502
- Is that a fake passport?
- A real passport.

440
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,275
You know what
happened to me in 1925.

441
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,274
No, I don't remember.

442
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,278
Oh, yes. Of course.

443
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,438
That stupid affair, with that ship.

444
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,107
Yes. The <i>Cape Martino.</i>

445
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,411
There was a woman on board.

446
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,988
I wasn't on the bridge when
it mattered.

447
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,058
With one fell swoop,
everything was gone.

448
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,127
My position, my career,
my good name.

449
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,197
Well, good heavens. Things happen.

450
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,232
- But now you're doing fine again.
- Fine?

451
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,562
So it seems.
Here, on the billionaire's ship.

452
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,638
With Mr. Wills?
Well, that's great.

453
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,536
You have no idea.

454
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,372
But, tell me...

455
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,604
what does he intend
to do with you?

456
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,008
Who?

457
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,740
He?

458
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,043
With me?

459
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,385
Don't make me laugh.
I! With him!

460
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,181
Yes.

461
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,217
Then be careful.

462
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,988
I know.

463
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,721
Holk!

464
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,957
Don't get involved with that man.

465
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,365
He is the dirtiest scoundrel I know.
He walks over corpses.

466
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,028
No one knows that
better than me, boy.

467
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,437
I almost experienced it firsthand.

468
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,338
- How?
- Lüders.

469
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:57,072
You have no idea
what that bastard did to me.

470
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,079
He blew up our plant.

471
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,251
And I lost my best friend with it.

472
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,980
A man, I tell you...

473
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:12,394
It may sound a little dramatic,
but I loved him like a father.

474
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,163
Well.

475
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,428
And the fact that you see me
walking around bright-eyed...

476
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,536
is only a coincidence as well.

477
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,236
Sheer coincidence.

478
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,471
And now I can tell you
why I'm going with you to Scotland.

479
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,747
Not to work...

480
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,844
but to get even.

481
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,183
I will pay him back for everything,

482
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,019
blow for blow.

483
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,753
And I swear to you, Lüders.

484
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,328
I won't spare him anything.

485
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,595
Please show Mr. Holk to his room.

486
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,028
And if it is all right with you,
we will meet in ten minutes.

487
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,895
- Thank you.
- This way, sir.

488
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,264
- Anything new?
- Nothing important.

489
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:30,499
- And my daughter? Is she here?
- Yes, the young lady has arrived.

490
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,439
Tomorrow she'll leave
on the <i>Savarona</i> for Nice.

491
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,307
- What?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,710
Didn't you remind her
that we have guests tomorrow?

493
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,184
Yes, I took the liberty
to point it out to her, but--

494
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,349
So?

495
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,751
I wish to speak
to my daughter at once.

496
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,204
What's wrong with you?

497
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,364
Why do you look so desperate?

498
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,306
Forgive me, sir,
but I can't find your tailcoat.

499
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,645
Impossible.

500
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,145
- You're joking?
- I'd never dare.

501
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,217
But it's not here.

502
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,115
Indeed.

503
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,189
My valet
must have forgotten to pack it.

504
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,757
Seems so.

505
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,656
- What will the gentleman do now?
- That's simple.

506
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,730
I will fire my valet at once.

507
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,695
- What else can I do?
- Yes, sir.

508
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,334
The young lady has a headache
and sends her apologies.

509
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,235
- A headache?
- Yes, sir.

510
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,069
Tell my daughter I want her
to postpone her trip to Nice.

511
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,003
And phone Engineer Harris.

512
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,950
Come on.

513
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,193
Step in.

514
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,430
- Will it go down the shaft?
- Yes.

515
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,440
You wanted to show me
your laboratory?

516
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,669
Just come on,
that's what I'm doing.

517
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,559
You've hidden
your laboratory very well.

518
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,962
Not me. Nature.

519
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,008
Lead.

520
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,274
Yes.

521
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,848
You've got lead,
and you want to make--

522
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,577
Exactly.

523
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,153
How practical.

524
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,945
Engineer Harris.
The man who didn't succeed.

525
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,019
Engineer Holk.
The man who will succeed.

526
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,149
Pleased to meet you, colleague.

527
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:15,351
Harris, you make sure that Holk
gets the whole thing running.

528
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,357
I think that's what he came here for.

529
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,429
Of course.
But he may have other plans.

530
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,794
Don't let him out of your sight.
Got me?

531
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,675
Harris, you're responsible
for the whole plant.

532
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,254
If the man turns out
to be a danger,

533
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,756
the plant is more
important to me than--

534
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,053
You know.

535
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,786
Harris.

536
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,369
Well, Mr. Holk?

537
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,669
Really impressive, Mr. Wills.

538
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,274
And the surge generators?
Where are they located?

539
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,607
Left in chambers outside the cave.

540
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,175
What's that up there?

541
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,911
The control station.

542
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,752
Hello.

543
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,427
At how many volts
have you run it so far?

544
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,659
- Five million.
- That's probably all you have.

545
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,665
Have?

546
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,565
We also have 10 or 14 million.

547
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,571
But I don't want to be there
when they're let loose.

548
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,637
We were well on the way
to solving the problem.

549
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,406
If we'd had a little more time--

550
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,413
Maybe well on the way,
but not the right one.

551
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:47,915
Really?

552
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,483
Well, I don't know
Achenbach's system--

553
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,818
What, you don't know the system,
dear colleague?

554
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,550
No.

555
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,787
But it's said to have
a certain resemblance to ours.

556
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,693
A certain resemblance?

557
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,966
An uncanny resemblance.

558
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,598
And what's the reason
it doesn't work?

559
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,332
I can tell you that.

560
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,375
The resemblance
is not close enough.

561
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:19,278
We-- Achenbach and I--
had gotten a little further.

562
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,783
But gold? You and your Professor
Achenbach couldn't produce it, Mr. Holk.

563
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,183
Isn't that right?

564
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,523
Yes.

565
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:33,924
That's right.

566
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,372
How far below ground are we?

567
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,448
We're not below ground.

568
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,017
- We're below the sea.
- Below the sea?

569
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,886
- You can't be serious.
- Yes.

570
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,957
The cave is 200 meters
from the coast.

571
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,686
Above us is the Atlantic Ocean.

572
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,111
- So, can you work here?
- Yes, you spared no expense.

573
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,421
Why laugh?

574
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:40,552
I just thought about how our
little laboratory in Berlin blew up.

575
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,726
What a big bang
that would have been...

576
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:49,597
if it had been a giant plant like this.

577
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,899
Mr. Holk.

578
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,406
I brought you here so that
you could do your experiment.

579
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,240
What neither you nor Professor
Achenbach have ever found,

580
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,651
I, John Wills, give to you:

581
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,382
Absolute confidence.

582
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,023
Whatever you command
will be carried out.

583
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,029
Whatever you need,
you will have.

584
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,027
No one has ever had
such possibilities.

585
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:25,199
And if you succeed in turning
the lead of Dunby into gold,

586
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,607
then you, Holk, will have performed
the most tremendous transformation.

587
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,340
Then this cave will be

588
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,416
the heart of the world.

589
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,715
And you, Holk, will decide
whether this heart beats...

590
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,447
or not.

591
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,285
And now, Holk,

592
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,123
it's up to you.

593
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,259
You're perfectly right of course.

594
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,833
It's up to me now.

595
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,100
- Did you find anything?
- No, nothing.

596
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,336
All this searching is pointless.

597
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,413
Holk won't be so stupid
as to leave something

598
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,412
lying around that no one is meant to see.

599
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,314
Tidy up here,
so he doesn't notice anything.

600
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,346
What are you doing here?

601
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,856
Who do these things belong to?

602
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,589
- Who is living here?
- Mr. Holk.

603
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,096
An acquaintance of my father's?

604
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:29,331
I can't say more. The gentleman
arrived just an hour ago.

605
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,365
And he knows you're rifling through
his bags in his absence?

606
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,105
Mr. Wills knows it.

607
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,885
I must tell Wills.

608
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,496
Is my father in his room?

609
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,226
Yes, Mr. Wills has just
returned from the plant.

610
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,567
Thank you.

611
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,241
Florence?

612
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,210
I want to talk to you.
Please leave us alone.

613
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,851
What's the matter?
Why so formal?

614
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,023
Who's that Mr. Holk
who arrived today?

615
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,955
A new engineer.

616
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,685
A very capable person.

617
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,421
He works for me,
down at the plant.

618
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,228
But he stays up here
and is your guest, isn't he?

619
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,732
Yes.

620
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,863
Then it's outrageous that
you have his suitcases searched.

621
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:46,173
I kindly ask you to show some restraint
in criticizing my measures.

622
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,513
And I kindly ask you show some restraint
in your measures against a guest.

623
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,850
Florence.

624
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,150
You don't know the situation.

625
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,252
I probably have my reasons.

626
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,453
The man could be dangerous to me.

627
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,962
I can't show consideration.

628
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,862
- Why then did you bring him here?
- Because I need him.

629
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,404
And now I want you
to end this interrogation.

630
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,804
I don't need to justify myself to you.

631
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,877
I don't meddle in your affairs either.

632
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,537
That Mr. Holk must be
an interesting person.

633
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,609
At least he's the first one
you seem to have respect for.

634
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,253
Very interesting.

635
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,920
By the way,

636
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,258
you've postponed your trip,
haven't you?

637
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,730
No, I leave tomorrow.

638
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,631
That's out of the question.
You will stay here.

639
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:44,795
I must go to Edinburgh today and
won't be back till tomorrow night.

640
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,967
You will have the goodness
to receive our guests.

641
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,603
The day after tomorrow,
you may go wherever you want.

642
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,281
That's very kind, but I've already
prepared for my departure tomorrow.

643
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,182
I'm afraid I can't change it anymore.

644
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,454
Florence!

645
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,821
Kelly!

646
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,376
Pitt!

647
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,274
Turn on number five!

648
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,941
Kelly!

649
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,016
Turn on transformer number five!

650
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,720
Nosy guy.

651
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,449
- Did you say something?
- No, no!

652
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,355
But if you keep standing
behind me like that,

653
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,588
I fear the electrical tension
might get too high.

654
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,892
I can easily get
a short circuit then.

655
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,894
Kelly!

656
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,130
Load surge generator five!

657
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,738
You and Pitt will stay here.
All the others, out!

658
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,898
Seven and a half million volts!
It's madness!

659
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,635
Who's experimenting here?

660
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,471
You or me?

661
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,875
- I'm responsible for the plant.
- Are you?

662
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,107
I forbid you to work at this voltage.

663
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,014
In one minute, you can forbid me
as much as you want.

664
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,319
And now you can follow me.
Now would be important.

665
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,916
Come with me, come!

666
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:17,783
Turn it off!

667
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,208
Mr. Holk, if you go on like this,
you'll destroy the apparatus.

668
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,951
Or I could succeed in making gold.

669
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,896
And that doesn't suit you, does it?

670
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,391
As long as I'm your chief engineer,

671
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,798
you won't mess around
with such high voltages!

672
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,371
I see.
You're the chief engineer.

673
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,098
- You're my superior.
- Yes.

674
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,674
- And I'm your inferior.
- Yes.

675
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,243
Then I'll tell you something,
Mr. Harris.

676
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,972
A long as there's
a chief engineer here,

677
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,879
I'm not interested
in all this crap.

678
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,877
For me, it's quitting time!

679
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,618
Blair, Pitt, your report!

680
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,789
Well, you better hurry,

681
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,026
or I'll do it first!

682
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,546
Yes. Holk?

683
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,198
- Mr. Holk? There's a car for you.
- Yes?

684
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,966
- What's the matter?
- The car's waiting above.

685
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,868
It's supposed to take you
to Dunby Castle.

686
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,542
To Mr. Wills?
Thank you, that suits me fine.

687
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,276
Hello?

688
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,842
I'm sorry, Mr. Harris,
you can't speak to Mr. Wills right now.

689
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,218
Maybe you can call again
tomorrow morning.

690
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,449
Ernst.

691
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,956
- Please tell him I'm here.
- You're already awaited.

692
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,186
Thanks.

693
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,468
- Mr. Holk?
- Yes.

694
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,330
Thank you for coming,
that's very kind. Please.

695
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,737
There must be
a misunderstanding.

696
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,314
I thought Mr. Wills
was waiting for me.

697
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,405
No, I asked you to come here.

698
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,182
Well, I'm Florence Wills.

699
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,918
But won't you come nearer?

700
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,158
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, I don't smoke.

701
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,491
May I ask to what I owe the honor
of being received by you?

702
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,304
You may light my cigarette,
Mr. Holk.

703
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,474
My apologies.

704
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,137
There you are.

705
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,541
- Some whiskey?
- Thank you, I don't drink.

706
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,879
You don't smoke,
you don't drink.

707
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:38,325
I hope you haven't made a vow
never to sit down?

708
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,458
No, I haven't.

709
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,336
Have you known my father
for a long time?

710
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,004
Personally, not until yesterday.

711
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,704
But I had heard of him.

712
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,046
Will you stay here for long?

713
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,085
Maybe.

714
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,549
Are you always so talkative?

715
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,384
Dear Miss.

716
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,987
You're asking me things Mr. Wills
has probably already told you, right?

717
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,166
You're wrong.

718
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,938
In the past three months, I've hardly
spoken to my father for five minutes.

719
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,201
By chance, today at noon.

720
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,538
That's when I heard of your
existence for the first time.

721
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,973
Do you want to know
in what context?

722
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,709
I can guess.

723
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,719
Mr. Wills must have asked you
to take care of me.

724
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,189
No. That is also wrong.

725
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,423
I wanted to meet you.

726
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,192
And I didn't think...

727
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,927
that it would be
so presumptuous of me

728
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,436
to ask you to keep me company.

729
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,607
On the contrary, miss,
its very flattering.

730
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,736
But after all,
I came to Dunby to work.

731
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,406
My head is filled with worries.

732
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:10,414
In such a state,
I'm certainly not much company.

733
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:14,887
So please don't take offense
if I say good-bye to you now.

734
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,296
One moment, Mr. Holk.

735
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,261
Yes?

736
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,698
You're only here to work, are you?

737
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,171
And not for some other reason?

738
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,973
I don't understand your question.

739
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,704
Are you sounding me out?

740
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,508
No.

741
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,049
I want to warn you.

742
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,019
They don't trust you here one bit.

743
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:50,024
I don't know why.
You don't need to explain.

744
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,684
I'm just telling you because
I want to prevent you

745
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:56,389
from getting yourself--
perhaps by some indiscretion--

746
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,397
into an unpleasant situation.

747
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,572
I won't keep you any longer.
Good-bye.

748
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,287
You're still here, Mr. Holk?

749
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,124
Yes, Miss Wills.
I think I owe you an apology.

750
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,722
I probably didn't behave correctly.

751
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,460
Never mind.

752
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,696
And I also want to--

753
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,774
You rang, miss?

754
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,606
You may serve lunch.

755
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,179
For two persons?

756
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,978
I'm being asked
if you'd like to join me.

757
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,488
So yes?

758
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,492
For two.

759
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,063
She says the <i>Savarona</i> will leave.

760
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,633
He says the <i>Savarona</i> won't leave.

761
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,032
Maybe you, Paddy,
can tell me what to do.

762
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,934
But, Mr. Jenkins, you didn't just
arrive here yesterday.

763
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,802
Of course what she wants
will happen.

764
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,399
Yes, but I must know
where I stand.

765
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,307
Please do me a favor
and tell her I'm here.

766
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,208
I'm afraid I can't.

767
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,441
The new engineer is with her
and I mustn't disturb them.

768
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,848
- Mr. Holk?
- Yes.

769
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,420
But it's really no use asking.

770
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,682
I'll give you a piece of advice.

771
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,418
Have the <i>Savarona</i>
ready for departure.

772
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,191
Excuse me, Mr. Jenkins.

773
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,769
Are you waiting for someone?

774
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,699
Yes. I'd like to speak to Mr. Holk.

775
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,775
Mr. Holk is still with Miss Wills.

776
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,174
But maybe you'd like
to wait for him in his room.

777
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,246
- May I show you upstairs?
- Yes, please.

778
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,814
Very well.

779
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:08,728
How is it you've hardly spoken
to your father in the last three months?

780
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,798
That's nothing out of the ordinary.

781
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,367
Sometimes, we don't see
each other for half a year.

782
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,630
My father doesn't care if I'm here
or traveling around the world.

783
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,140
He's only interested
in his business and...

784
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,778
I don't want to have
anything to do with that.

785
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,215
I see.

786
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,545
I'm only here for one day now too.

787
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,715
Tomorrow I will leave on the <i>Savarona,</i>
for the Mediterranean.

788
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,121
And who knows
when I'll be back.

789
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,993
Then the two of us
will never meet again.

790
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,598
You never know, Mr. Holk.

791
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,939
By the way, you don't seem
to be too keen on that.

792
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,983
Excuse me. I only wanted to ask
if you desire anything.

793
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,483
No, thank you.

794
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,851
May I bring you some newspapers?
Some cigars? Or some whiskey?

795
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,254
No, thanks. I hope it won't
take that long downstairs.

796
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,485
I can't say.

797
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,721
I'm afraid I lack experience here.

798
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:19,664
So far, Miss Wills has never invited
a guest to lunch alone on his first day.

799
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,435
Any other wishes, miss?

800
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,731
No, thank you.

801
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,039
Well.

802
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,548
It's gotten late.

803
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,914
You want to leave tomorrow
and have to rise early,

804
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,818
so I better take my leave now.

805
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,951
So, farewell, Mr. Holk.

806
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,019
It was an enchanting evening.

807
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,396
I must honestly say
that I never would have thought

808
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,992
I'd meet a person like you here,

809
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,935
Miss Florence.

810
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,736
I wish you a pleasant trip.

811
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,310
I thank you.

812
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,611
But if you really want me
to have a pleasant trip,

813
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,479
then please grant me one wish.

814
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,051
Of course.

815
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,812
Please don't take any steps
against my father here.

816
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,561
I say that not for his sake.
Good night.

817
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,637
- At last!
- Willi?

818
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,475
- I thought you'd never come.
- What are you doing here?

819
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,049
I've been waiting for three hours
to say good-bye to you.

820
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,210
- We leave tomorrow.
- Well, I couldn't come sooner.

821
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,788
You worked so long.

822
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,357
I had a lot of things
to do at the plant.

823
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,357
And how is it there?

824
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,086
Great, I tell you.

825
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,993
The machine this chap
has set up there is fantastic.

826
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,726
- One definitely could work there.
- Really?

827
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,200
But that's not what
you came here for.

828
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,704
You wanted to get even
with Mr. Wills, didn't you?

829
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,935
And I will, you can count on that.

830
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,311
That machine must go.

831
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,543
I already looked around
down at the plant.

832
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:22,215
Willi, if I turn on
all of those 15 million volts,

833
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:29,022
it would release energy stronger than
ten hundredweights of Ecrasite.

834
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,593
But it's not that easy.

835
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,670
And then something else
occurred to me

836
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,266
as I stood in front
of the machine today.

837
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,607
If I could show
even one ounce of gold

838
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,043
that I made with that apparatus,

839
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:58,555
then the name of Achenbach
would regain its reputation.

840
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,650
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sure.

841
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,191
And that occurred to you
when you saw the machine?

842
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,703
And not during your
three-hour-long conversation

843
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,430
with Miss Wills?

844
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,304
Look, Werner.

845
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,877
You don't need to lie to me.

846
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,106
I've got nothing against you
working for Mr. Wills.

847
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:25,612
For all I care, you can flirt
with his daughter 10 hours a day.

848
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,649
But then don't tell me
anything about...

849
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:35,095
revenge or getting even
blow for blow.

850
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,994
Willi, you are an idiot.

851
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,169
Miss Wills just couldn't find
anybody else today.

852
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,898
Do you know how much
she cares about me?

853
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,737
- Not that much.
- Yes, yes, I know that.

854
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,545
I told you what happened to me.

855
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,114
You're lucky
she's leaving tomorrow.

856
01:02:54,203 --> 01:03:00,449
See. Then you have
no reason to worry.

857
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,352
I'm tired.

858
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,085
Please allow me
to get some sleep.

859
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,424
Bye, Willi, I wish you
good luck and a nice--

860
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,932
Come in.

861
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,194
Excuse me.

862
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,429
- For you, Mr. Holk.
- For me?

863
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,138
Mr. Jenkins.

864
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,334
The <i>Savarona</i> won't leave tomorrow.
The young lady has decided to stay.

865
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,344
Good night.

866
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,912
Good night.

867
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,121
Read this.

868
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:38,848
I kindly ask you to by my guest
at our soiree tomorrow.

869
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,928
Kind regards, Florence Wills.

870
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,026
You'll understand what that means.

871
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,536
Yes.

872
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,041
Then there's only one thing to do.

873
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,804
Tomorrow night,
the machine will be blown up.

874
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,747
Did you give Mr. Holk
my invitation?

875
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,751
Of course, miss.

876
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,021
My apologies for the delay.

877
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,923
It has just arrived.

878
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,495
I hope it fits.

879
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,622
- May I help you?
- No, no. I don't need you.

880
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,693
- Say, the guests are all here?
- Yes, Mr. Holk.

881
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,567
- Mr. Wills, too?
- No, Mr. Wills is expected in one hour.

882
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,972
I see. What about the engineers
and Mr. Harris?

883
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,704
Well, I can't say for sure,

884
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,542
but I've already seen
most of the gentlemen.

885
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,554
Permit me to remark that...

886
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:18,114
the young lady has already asked
for you several times, Mr. Holk.

887
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,289
I see.

888
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,163
Well.

889
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,339
Wonderful music.

890
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,075
And what a charming host.

891
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,412
Thank you very much.

892
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,281
I could get used to this.

893
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,322
Did you prepare everything?

894
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,394
Everything ready.

895
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,986
Start the generators in this order
and with voltages as written here.

896
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,221
One, three, four, two, five. Got it?

897
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,299
Golly! That's up to seven
and a half million volts!

898
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,026
So what?

899
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:10,434
These are the voltages
Mr. Holk gave me.

900
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,528
Spare me your remarks!

901
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,271
- Do as I've told you.
- Yes, Chief Engineer.

902
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,605
The gate is closing!

903
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,088
Mr. Holk?
What are you doing here?

904
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:30,816
What do you want here?

905
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,353
Why are you closing the gate?

906
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,365
Looks like I came just in time.

907
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,733
At night, behind my back,
the chief engineer

908
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,930
wants to run the show
and conduct the experiment!

909
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,266
And tomorrow,
in the eyes of the world,

910
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,071
he'll be the famous man,
the brilliant inventor.

911
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,306
And Achenbach
will forever remain the dilettante

912
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,882
who wasn't able
to tackle the problem!

913
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,451
Out of here, you thief!

914
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,866
Out! Get out!

915
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,299
What's the matter?

916
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,631
- Alarm!
- Put your clothes on.

917
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,706
Come on, we must get out!

918
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,339
Shut up!

919
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,138
Inform them up there!

920
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,395
Is that the siren from the plant?

921
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,467
Go, let's have a look.

922
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,475
What's that?

923
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,312
Something must have happened
at the mine, an accident.

924
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,094
- Is Mr. Holk still in his room?
- No. He left the castle half an hour ago.

925
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,095
Why didn't you tell me that?

926
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,893
I'll take my car.
But discreetly.

927
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,346
What kind of signal was that, miss?

928
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:14,921
The siren at the mine.

929
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,921
It's quitting time.
They just wanted to let us know.

930
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:20,255
I see.
The siren for quitting time.

931
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,393
Please play on.

932
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,008
- What's going on here?
- We don't know.

933
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:46,419
Take me down!

934
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,451
<i>Come on, let's start.</i>

935
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,054
<i>For now, the gentlemen
are right to have their doubts.</i>

936
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,225
<i>Our experiments have
only been successful on paper thus far.</i>

937
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,817
<i>But Professor,
how can you say that?</i>

938
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,226
<i>So we must prove it.</i>

939
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,465
<i>Today!</i>

940
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,498
<i>Attention, Holk. Now.</i>

941
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,502
<i>Becker?</i>

942
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,231
<i>Turn on the surge generators.</i>

943
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,308
<i>But in the right order!</i>

944
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,115
Pitt!

945
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,850
Turn on the surge generators!

946
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,585
But in the right order!

947
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:04,221
Five-one-two-four-three!

948
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,796
What's going on here?

949
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,639
Mr. Holk is in the plant.

950
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,871
He interrupted the gate
controls from inside.

951
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,007
Why didn't you take care?

952
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:36,996
Go on!

953
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,628
There.

954
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,302
Open your hand.

955
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:11,633
Just open your hand, man!

956
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,388
Gold!

957
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:52,851
Gold!

958
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:54,954
Gold!

959
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,549
Gold!

960
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,623
Gold!

961
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,092
Gold!

962
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:08,901
Mr. Holk!

963
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,240
Mr. Harris!

964
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,373
What happened?

965
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,673
Holk succeeded.

966
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:52,002
I'm so glad that I can be
the first to congratulate you.

967
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,287
Come with me, Mr. Holk.

968
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:34,212
October 5th

969
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,220
The Dawning of a Golden Age!

01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:45,627
Renowned Business Leader
Predicts General Prosperity!

972
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,301
October 6th

973
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:56,370
Mass Production of
Artificial Gold Planned

974
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,880
Boost to World Economy Expected

975
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,049
October 7th

976
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,747
Big Banks Warn of Gold Inflation!

01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:11,052
Frantic Preparations
for Gold Production

978
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,683
Call for Legal Countermeasures

979
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:16,922
John Wills Objects to Any Intervention

980
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,257
October 8th

981
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,169
Stock Markets in Panic
Due to Gold Announcement!

982
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:27,672
Bank Presidents and Economic
Leaders Meet with John Wills

983
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:31,506
Riots among Unemployed Miners
in South African Gold Districts!

984
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,679
October 9th

985
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:39,611

988
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:52,865
October 10th

989
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:59,130
"Golden Pest" Begins its Campaign
of Destruction Tomorrow

990
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:03,642
Wills Declares Ruthlessly:
"Every Invention Demands its Victims!"

991
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,713
Vast Amounts of Lead
Roll into Dunby Plant

992
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:13,876
Couldn't they find anything lighter
to make gold from than lead?

993
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,640
From Mr. Holk.
Very urgent.

994
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,812
What he demands by tomorrow--

995
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,483
Our people can't handle that.

996
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,051
They're completely exhausted.

997
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,246
Five days and nights at this tempo,
no one can take that.

998
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,822
Well, no one does.

999
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,050
- No, that's just too much.
- Yes.

1000
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,653
Lunch break.

1001
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,496
Is Mr. Holk out to lunch?

1002
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,233
No, he fends off his appetite
by working.

1003
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,847
Mr. Holk?

1004
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:17,416
Yes?

1005
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,680
- What's the matter?
- Miss Wills called.

1006
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,757
She asks you to come up
to the castle tonight.

1007
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,484
Yes.

1008
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:30,393
Please tell her that I'll have
to work all night at the plant.

1009
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,224
I'm sorry that again
I won't be able to come.

1010
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:35,568
Enjoy your meal.

1011
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:41,233
I tell you, it's going to be great.

1012
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,307
Great!

1013
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,536
Listen to the nonsense
Charlie is spouting again.

1014
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:45,771
Why is it nonsense?

1015
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,178
Once we've started gold production,
I know what I'll do.

1016
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,842
I'll buy myself a nice big house

1017
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,851
with a flower garden,

1018
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,751
and a car

1019
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:58,347
and a concertina.

1020
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,923
And a telescope.

1021
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,326
Why a telescope?

1022
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:06,399
Why not?
What difference does it make?

1023
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,958
Listening to you, you'd think
the machine will work for you alone.

1024
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,833
You stupid goat!

1025
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,702
All the money will go to Wills.

1026
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,875
And to the banks.

1027
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,444
- You won't get a damn thing.
- How's that?

1028
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,843
The more gold, the more work.

1029
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,745
The more work, the more money.

1030
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:25,113
The more you talk, the more rubbish.

1031
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,021
- Mr. Holk?
- What's the matter now?

1032
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,325
Aren't you hungry?

1033
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,957
Do you have to eat all the time?

1034
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,967
I can stand it
for a few hours if I have to.

1035
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,660
But you don't have to.

1036
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,101
That's very kind of you, Pitt.

1037
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,010
- Thank you.
- Here's your cutlery.

1038
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,520
I'll tell you something.

1039
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,923
If Wills is allowed
to construct his machine,

1040
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:09,261
then I can set up a printing shop.

1041
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:11,988
And print my own bank notes.

1042
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,166
Is there any difference?

1043
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,735
- It's exactly the same thing.
- Yes. You're right.

1044
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,305
To me, the whole thing
seems a bit fishy, too.

1045
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:22,534
Nonsense! If that's how it was,
Holk would never take part!

1046
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,212
You have to admit,
the boy's all right.

1047
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,939
He'd never do anything against us.

1048
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,949
As long as he's there,
we don't need to worry.

1049
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,782
May I ask you something,
Mr. Holk?

1050
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,354
Of course you can, Pitt.

1051
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,753
Even if it's something stupid?

1052
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,518
Then more than ever.

1053
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,991
Why do you want
to make gold here?

1054
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,838
That's not a stupid
question at all, Pitt.

1055
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,001
- Pour me another glass of beer.
- Yes, sir.

1056
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,237
You know, at first I was just
as enthusiastic as the others.

1057
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,246
But then I thought about it.

1058
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,318
- And now I don't know.
- Thanks.

1059
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,489
Is it right what you intend to do?

1060
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:14,986
Well.

1061
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,563
The newspapers write
such strange things.

1062
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,963
If you read it,
you'd think that--

1063
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,662
That we've caused
nothing but trouble so far.

1064
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:24,668
Yes.

1065
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,739
Yes, I know that, Pitt.

1066
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,739
I read the newspapers, too.

1067
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,834
But then I don't understand.
Then wouldn't it be better if--

1068
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,937
If the machine just didn't
start working tomorrow.

1069
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,581
That's what you want to say.

1070
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,847
Don't you?

1071
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,754
Speak up! Spit it out!

1072
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,088
Engineer, you know better than I.

1073
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,093
Yes.

1074
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,857
Of course.

1075
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,399
And what if I thought the same thing?

1076
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,701
If I dropped everything
and went away?

1077
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,637
- What then?
- Well, then--

1078
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,936
It would be a mistake, my good fellow.

1079
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:06,604
Tomorrow, others would be here.

1080
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,341
And one of the gentlemen
would finally figure out...

1081
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,943
how the thing works.

1082
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,119
That's right.

1083
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:16,349
Pitt.

1084
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,755
There's only one solution.

1085
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:22,528
Isn't there?

1086
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,966
Lunch break is over.

1087
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,196
We'll have a drink over this later.

1088
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,300
Come to my cabin tonight.

1089
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:02,227
Evening, Willi.
Thanks for coming.

1090
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,135
I need to ask you a favor.

1091
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:10,368
Can you post this letter for me
tomorrow at noon?

1092
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:14,741
I might not be able
to do it anymore.

1093
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,277
- What does that mean?
- Listen good.

1094
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:21,377
You know the plant down there.

1095
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,989
Listen.

1096
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:26,718
The rock ceiling is very thin.

1097
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,995
If I start the machine
with 15 million volts,

1098
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:32,325
it will break and explode...

1099
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,967
and the seawater will break through.

1100
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,169
But the gate will withstand it.

1101
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,199
Then everything depends
on whether I can get out...

1102
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,041
before it has closed.

1103
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,547
Do you understand?

1104
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,448
It sounds damned serious this time.

1105
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,546
It is, this time, Willi.

1106
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,714
That's why I gave you the letter.

1107
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:05,721
"Miss Margit Möller, Berlin,
Rankestraße 87."

1108
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,691
And Florence Wills?

1109
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,638
Because of her, I'd almost
forgotten the other one.

1110
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,799
The other day, at the party,
I was well on my way

1111
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,106
to falling head over heels
in love with her.

1112
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,777
But then Mr. Wills came over
and gave me this piece of gold.

1113
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,550
And he energetically explained to me

1114
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:33,251
that he intended to tie me
to his family with it.

1115
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:37,888
You can guess
what he meant by that.

1116
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,736
I haven't seen Florence since.

1117
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,897
And I won't see her again.

1118
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:52,903
Well.

1119
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,279
So...

1120
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,009
Now I'll go down to the plant.

1121
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,113
Bye, Willi.

1122
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,690
- Can I do something for you?
- Thanks, my dear friend.

1123
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:08,090
If all goes well, come down to the port.
Do you understand?

1124
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:11,254
I'll prepare everything
to get us out of here.

1125
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,490
Us?

1126
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,066
I'll go with you.

1127
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,201
Yes, "if."

1128
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:21,137
If everything goes well.

1129
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,942
Take me down.

1130
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:41,816
Pitt?

1131
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,801
Start the machine.

1132
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,700
Turn on the transformers,
load the surge generators.

1133
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,272
Mr. Holk?

1134
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,308
Mr. Wills wants to speak
before we start working.

1135
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:57,467
From up on the machine.

1136
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,828
In a few minutes,

1137
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,063
we will begin

1138
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,902
to pump the stream of our gold

1139
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,306
out of this machine

1140
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:34,039
into the economic channels
of every country

1141
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:37,139
thus spreading happiness,
wealth and blessings

1142
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,548
over the entire world.

1143
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,814
At this historical moment,

1144
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,893
I must not fail to congratulate the man

1145
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,124
who was first to succeed

1146
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,861
in what previously
seemed impossible.

1147
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,767
His ingenious creativity

1148
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,170
gave this machine

1149
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:04,732
purpose and life.

1150
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:09,375
I thank you, Mr. Holk.

1151
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:14,612
And now, to work!

1152
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,452
Everyone to his place.

1153
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,792
Gold production is about to begin!

1154
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,793
One moment!

1155
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,299
Mr. Wills!

1156
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,300
For you and the others here,

1157
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,030
I'd like to say a few words

1158
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,607
that you, in your haste,
seem to have forgotten.

1159
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:40,311
It wasn't my ingenious creativity

1160
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:44,144
that brought the world
to this decisive moment.

1161
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,620
We all owe it to the ingenuity

1162
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,586
of somebody else.

1163
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,854
Nonsense, please, my dear Mr. Holk--

1164
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,586
Yes, yes, we do.

1165
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,859
I must tell everything,
here and now, Mr. Wills.

1166
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,024
I must say the name of that man.

1167
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,633
And you know him very well, too.

1168
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,263
Achenbach.

1169
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,668
Professor Achenbach!

1170
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,212
He was the one
who invented this machine!

1171
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,779
My teacher was
a good, dear man

1172
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:20,045
who wanted to serve
science alone--

1173
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,553
Science alone!

1174
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:27,285
And when he was mere seconds
away from his success,

1175
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:33,698
then he was--
in the most ghastly way--

1176
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:36,435
Sent to the hereafter.

1177
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,902
I think that doesn't
belong here, Mr. Holk.

1178
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,633
It does belong here, Mr. Wills!

1179
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,411
You have Professor Achenbach
on your conscience.

1180
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,310
You've stolen his invention!

1181
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:51,815
- You built that machine with his plans--
- Have you gone crazy?

1182
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:58,122
- I forbid you to go on.
- You can't forbid me anything.

1183
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,385
- I'm talking now!
- No!

1184
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:03,291
What does all this mean?
Let Mr. Holk speak!

1185
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:05,193
Yes, we want to know
what's going on here!

1186
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:07,596
- Let him finish!
- Let him finish!

1187
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,698
Silence!

1188
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:14,706
Be silent!

1189
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:17,071
This is none of your business.

1190
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,474
These are our private matters.

1191
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,106
We'll settle them
between the two of us.

1192
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:26,374
But what
does concern all of you,

1193
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:30,984
what will really happen,

1194
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:35,458
when this machine takes up
its work in a few minutes?

1195
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,793
Not happiness,
wealth and blessings,

1196
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:42,060
but poverty and misery
will be spread all over the world.

1197
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:44,898
How much harm
have you already done

1198
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:48,098
by simply announcing your gold?

1199
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:50,368
Riots, bank crashes,

1200
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:53,104
the suicide of poor wretches

1201
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:57,012
who felt betrayed over
their last meager savings!

1202
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,244
And what for?

1203
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,582
You, Mr. John Wills!

1204
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,049
What for?

1205
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,751
Because you want to play at destiny,

1206
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:12,057
because your thirst for power
is insatiable,

1207
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,463
because you want to amass
ever newer riches,

1208
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,967
because in your
delusions of grandeur,

1209
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:19,664
you believe you can be
a leader of the world economy!

1210
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,908
And now I'll tell you
what you really are.

1211
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:25,739
A pathetic, lowly murderer!

1212
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,747
- What do you say?
- A cowardly murderer!

1213
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,442
So, boys, I had to tell you that,
because he'd forgotten it!

1214
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,380
And now, everyone to work,

1215
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:38,457
everyone to his place.

1216
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:42,084
Gold production for John Wills begins!

1217
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,623
- Gold production will not begin.
- Right.

1218
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:49,360
What are you saying?

1219
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,936
Hey! Who are you?

1220
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,268
A worker, Mr. Wills.

1221
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:56,764
Stop!

1222
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,108
No one will leave this plant!

1223
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,454
Didn't you hear me?

1224
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,720
This is my last warning!

1225
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,455
Get to work!

1226
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:23,067
It is all lies! That he's told you!

1227
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:24,966
And I tell you--

1228
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,800
Everyone out!

1229
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:28,373
You as well, Wills!

1230
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:31,809
In four minutes, this machine
will be blown to bits!

1231
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:34,311
In four minutes, fish
will be swimming around here!

1232
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,479
Go on, boys,
everybody out of the plant now.

1233
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:40,051
In one minute,
I'll close the gate.

1234
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:41,984
Outside you'll be safe.

1235
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:02,107
What are you doing there?

1236
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,675
Turn off the machines.

1237
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,574
- That's not possible anymore.
- Why not?

1238
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,113
Why you...

1239
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,114
I'm closing the gate.

1240
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,355
Come with me!

1241
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,561
Holk! Holk!

1242
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:32,797
For God's sake!
Turn off the machine!

1243
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:35,305
That's not possible anymore.

1244
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,034
Come on, Pitt.

1245
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:14,410
All right! Blow it all up now!

1246
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,972
Now the whole mine
will be drowned!

1247
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,983
The both of us will drown here!

1248
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:21,712
The boys!

1249
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,889
Pitt, a ladder! Come on!

1250
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,357
Five hundred will die!

1251
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:38,129
Get out!

1252
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:41,968
The gate won't close anymore!
Quickly!

1253
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:43,598
Get out!

1254
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,111
Run!

1255
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,002
Come on!

1256
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:03,254
Pitt!

1257
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,491
Get me a cable cutter!

1258
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:11,659
Wills! Get out of there!

1259
01:38:47,855 --> 01:38:49,835
The fourth one is already whirling!

1260
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,070
Mr. Holk!

1261
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:36,981
Out of here!

1262
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,659
Mr. Holk?

1263
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:31,398
Mr. Holk?

1264
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:39,273
Come with me, Mr. Holk.

1265
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:41,345
Yes.

1266
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,115
Believe me, Holk,
I prefer this old tub

1267
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,689
to the pretentious <i>Savarona.</i>

1268
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:27,423
And I know why, Willi.

1269
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:29,653
Because it's taking us home.

1270
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,230
That's always the nicest cruise.

1271
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:58,681
Werner!

1272
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:00,885
Come!

1273
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:06,060
And if someone
should ask you one day,

1274
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:09,825
"Tell me, Mrs. Holk.

1275
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:13,735
What's the story with the..."

1276
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:16,307
Then you'll simply say,

1277
01:42:16,396 --> 01:42:17,875
"Werner Holk?

1278
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:21,037
He never made any gold.
He can't make any.

1279
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:25,078
And he will never try again.

1280
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,420
Because no blessings come of it.

1281
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:33,758
That's why you ought not make any."

1282
