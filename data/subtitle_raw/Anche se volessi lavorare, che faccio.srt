1
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,191
Oh, God, they are priests!
And now?

2
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,358
Madam, get in.

3
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,316
I live in Borghetto.
I don't know if it's along the way.

4
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,691
We have to go past there.
Come.

5
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,733
Don't worry. Give me your hand.

6
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,066
I don't want to bother.

7
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:48,233
Stop! Keep your hands to yourself!

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,108
What are you doing?

9
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,983
Filthy scums!

10
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,316
You bastards!

11
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,566
- My purse!
- Give her purse back.

12
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,775
My purse is there!

13
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,608
- Here it is!
- Stop!

14
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:07,025
- The fender!
- Run!

15
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:11,566
What is your order?
The "darn you! "order?

16
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,566
- I got it.
- Give it to me.

17
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,650
She's angry!

18
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:22,566
I told you she wouldn't do it.

19
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,108
Can I hang on?

20
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,650
- Sure, go ahead.
- Thank you.

21
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:45,191
Don't do that, Sunflower.
They are just ordinary men.

22
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,108
They're policemen, and they hit.
You were never caught.

23
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,066
- My mother is Franciscan.
- Nice place! I went there.

24
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:58,316
- We don't care.
- I'd like to be a policeman.

25
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:02,400
- Be quiet.
- That is the last thing we needed.

26
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,733
Goodbye, Father. Thank you.

27
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,483
- Help!
- What is going on?

28
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,983
Help! Let me go!

29
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,358
- There's someone who hits here.
- Then don't stop.

30
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,900
Stop! Help! He's killing me!

31
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:31,733
Stop! Help! Stop!

32
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,191
- Father!
- What is going on?

33
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,733
My uncle is having an attack.

34
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,983
He's possessed by the devil!
Help me! Get off.

35
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,191
Darn you!

36
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,191
You're breaking everything!

37
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,900
May lightning strike you!

38
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,358
- There he is.
- Peace and good will. May we?

39
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,358
You can't go. We're two
poor women. You're leaving us?

40
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:04,483
- He'll kill us.
- What can we do?

41
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,816
I'll show you.

42
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:12,191
Father Curly!

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,232
- Are you hurt?
- The devil pisses him off.

44
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,525
Brother Giocondo, take the ladies
over there and bless the house.

45
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,482
- We'll take care of him.
- Go inside.

46
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:32,232
- How long has he been like this?
- Since he began digging.

47
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,857
Maybe it's because of this thing.

48
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,691
Yes. It's ghostly stuff
that comes from tombs.

49
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:43,025
- Do you have other pieces?
- He found a painted piece too.

50
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:47,232
Hold still. Lallo, hold him.

51
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,650
What a blow!

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,107
Pray, brothers.

53
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:03,900
- Is he dead?
- No. The devils have left.

54
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,691
- Oh, God!
- He's sleeping.

55
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:09,525
- Don't wake him up.
- He's well now. Happy, Auntie?

56
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,025
I want to make an offering.

57
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,608
- Who will I give it to?
- Get some cheese.

58
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:17,441
Brothers, let's go. It's late.

59
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,566
Holy Vereconda!

60
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:22,691
Thank you for having chased
the devil from my uncle's body.

61
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,607
We can ask the cleaner's shop
for 200,000 Liras.

62
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,316
- There's a lot of stuff.
- Depends on Asvero.

63
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:38,400
- You feel good this time?
- Yeah, Asvero...

64
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:41,150
I am sick and tired.

65
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:44,816
You speak well.
In the end, it's always my turn.

66
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:47,357
You were born cute.

67
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:50,400
It was my turn twice.
Once for Lallo.

68
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,275
- She's beautiful.
- She scares you because she's mute.

69
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,900
- Sunflower!
- What did I say?

70
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:14,775
Good morning, Mrs. Tilde.
We're the Colle Civitella people.

71
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,275
We have some stuff.
You want to look at it?

72
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:22,816
Look. There are 23 pieces. We're
giving everything at 300,000 Liras,

73
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,275
even the saint if you want.

74
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,857
Look at this.

75
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,066
It's a 6th century vase.

76
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,691
- What did she say?
- What she said the last time.

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,025
Mrs. Tilde, we're in line.

78
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:16,025
- Let's go.
- Go.

79
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:20,357
- Go!
- Sorry. I'm not...

80
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:25,107
- Go!
- I'm not very practical with this.

81
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,191
My arm!

82
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,816
Yes.

83
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:34,816
Don't push.

84
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,566
You're closing the curtain?
Even in the dark? She's crazy.

85
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,232
Yes.

86
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,483
Anything you say!

87
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,316
What're you saying?

88
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm not very fond of this.

89
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,150
You even locked me up.

90
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,900
Open the door and let me out.

91
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,690
If you want, I'll go call Asvero.

92
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,815
I'll do it!

93
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:58,315
Easy, Asvero, or it will break.

94
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,441
- Easy!
- Here's the vase.

95
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,358
Sunflower liked it so much!

96
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,566
I can't! I'm not wearing underpants.

97
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:16,441
I am embarrassed.

98
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,275
Excuse me, but who should I hit?

99
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,315
Should I hit?

100
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:54,190
Should I hit? I'll gladly do it.

101
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,815
I'll hit, huh?

102
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:01,858
What're you doing?
You're hitting? Let go!

103
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:05,858
Do you think I'm a softie?
I'll kick you!

104
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:09,400
Come on, let it go!

105
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,900
You're hurting me!

106
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,400
Where are you?

107
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,233
Darn it!

108
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,358
What're you doing?
Let me go!

109
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,150
Let me go!

110
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,483
I'll show you now.

111
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,525
You're begging for help?

112
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:34,525
Even at 10,000 a piece,
it would be about 250,000.

113
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,815
- How much is it?
- 100,000.

114
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:40,190
We spent 120. Let's make it
at least 150,000. You tell her.

115
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,650
She won't listen. She said 100,000.
Take it or leave it.

116
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:48,440
- You want to leave?
- Ok. Asvero, look for Sunflower.

117
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:52,065
Sunflower!

118
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,565
Lallo, come!

119
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,150
Give me a hand.

120
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:06,650
She beat the hell out of me.

121
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,066
Damn her!

122
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,233
Who are you?

123
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,275
Hurry.

124
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,690
- Halt!
- You go. Get him!

125
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,900
No, dear colleague.

126
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:00,150
According to the norm of decree
1852, it's my jurisdiction.

127
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:02,775
We are in the
Colle Civitella district here.

128
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,650
Let's forget about
"dear colleague".

129
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:10,025
If you mean that man, you're
not considering the change

130
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:14,108
made by the RD 1929,
a basic law.

131
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,983
Who is it?

132
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,691
- Those scums!
- It's you!

133
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,650
- They don't give up!
- Garrone, what're you doing here?

134
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,983
They've been following me
from Ponte Nuovo.

135
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,775
Who is he, Sunflower?

136
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,315
He's the new tenant.
My grandma rented a niche.

137
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,358
- Are you going out?
- No, I'm going to sleep.

138
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:48,108
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, my ass!

139
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:52,150
Grandma, don't wear my gloves
as socks!

140
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,065
I was awake the whole night.

141
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,190
I can't hear anything in one ear.

142
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:59,483
- What've you got here?
- What do you care?

143
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,275
- What do I care?
- Right.

144
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:05,525
You have to go.
You've nothing to do here!

145
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:10,316
Be quiet. They're up here.
Do you hear them walking?

146
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:15,191
So it's the Finance Guards' duty
to arrest him.

147
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:19,150
I saw him first,
and I've been here since last night.

148
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:22,650
I've been waiting a week
for him here!

149
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,275
Marshal Dorigo!

150
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:27,691
- Did you get him?
- He disappeared.

151
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:30,316
He jumped from the gully.

152
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,275
Go to the car.

153
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,940
Please, dear colleague.

154
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,565
Maybe you are right.

155
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:44,483
In fact, the paragraph
of the single text says...

156
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,775
Just a moment.
Let's examine this.

157
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,025
Since it's an offense
done under your jurisdiction,

158
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,440
in your territory,

159
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,108
if we want to be precise,

160
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:00,733
the Finance Guard
has nothing to do with it.

161
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,108
- But you saw him first.
- No difference. We're not on a hunt.

162
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,900
- You just said it.
- Forget it. Let's go.

163
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:12,483
- The basic law...
- Let's go!

164
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,650
Does he think he's handsome?

165
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:19,108
Marshal, he was our criminal.

166
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,858
If you'd caught him,
but you had him get away.

167
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,441
So it was the Finance Guards' duty,
alright? Let's go.

168
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:30,650
Life is impossible here
since that jinx came.

169
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,775
- Who? Novembersecond?
- Damn it!

170
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,275
- Grandma, the light.
- Your gloves.

171
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,440
Good morning, Cesira.
How's your little girl?

172
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,108
Run! Run!

173
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:50,190
Mom's love! Close the door!

174
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:00,150
Don't insist, please.

175
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,191
It's an exceptional bronze.

176
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,275
Come to me with your car.
It'll be quicker.

177
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:08,941
- I don't like going around today.
- Why?

178
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:14,108
Two policemen are at the highway toll
spot, and the Finance Guards too.

179
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,108
Don't worry.

180
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:20,358
Then why did we come from Rome?

181
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:24,108
Here he is again! I guarantee
that it's 6th century stuff.

182
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,441
They've already put it in a tire.

183
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:31,816
- Where?
- An automobile wheel.

184
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,150
Come to me. I'll be waiting.

185
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,025
- Mr. Nereo.
- Hello, Garrone.

186
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,065
Good morning, Mrs. Celeste.

187
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,483
- How's the day going?
- Fine, until now.

188
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,233
I'll bet you are a foreigner.

189
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:55,858
May I? Nereo Tirelli,
a local Etruscan expert.

190
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,150
- May I offer you something?
- No, thank you.

191
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:01,900
- I already ordered a cappuccino.
- Good. I'll pay. Two cappuccinos.

192
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,108
Are you buying?

193
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:08,900
I'm the only professional
grave robber here.

194
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:13,066
The others are amateurs,

195
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,858
common thieves.

196
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,275
If you come to my home,

197
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,941
I will show you...

198
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:32,733
Let's go, sir.

199
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,565
- Where do you want to go?
- I'll get off farther down.

200
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,900
He is crazy.

201
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:49,108
If he always drives like that,
sooner or later...

202
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,940
It's a miracle if I'm alive.
I almost had a mortal accident

203
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:58,190
just because I saw him outside
the cafe. You know who I mean?

204
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,191
Certainly, Novembersecond.

205
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:03,400
He was the most controlled
grave robber of the area.

206
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,858
Certainly.

207
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,650
Now that he's back, the Finance
Guards and Carabinieri are here.

208
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,775
Until yesterday, we did what we
wanted. He ruined us.

209
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,608
There was a helicopter yesterday.
Curly saw it.

210
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,900
Agony, what should we do?

211
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:20,983
Garrone says he won't take
our stuff anymore.

212
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,650
- He has to.
- You've come from Rome 5 years

213
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,483
saying, "Dig. I'll place the stuff."

214
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,900
They're all digging like mice here.

215
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,400
We risk, and you're backing out?

216
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:36,441
I'm not backing out,
but I won't get the stuff here.

217
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,525
It is too dangerous now.

218
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:42,608
Bring it to Rome.
I always have good clients for you.

219
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,316
You say this because
there isn't a grave robber union.

220
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,733
It's a miracle if I'm alive!

221
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,316
I won't ever come back here.

222
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:54,650
And watch out,
searches are under way.

223
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:57,400
- Good night to everyone!
- Get out!

224
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,525
Agony, Garrone left.

225
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,858
Did you hear that?

226
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,816
I heard, but what do you want
from me?

227
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:10,483
- So what?
- So... I don't give a darn.

228
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,191
You've been sleeping for free here
for three years now.

229
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,275
You could pay your debt.

230
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:21,108
What should I do? I'm stuck
in bed with this ugly illness.

231
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:25,608
I piss in my pants
20 times a day.

232
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,483
Agostino has an idea.

233
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,025
We could hide the pieces
in your mattress.

234
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,233
Or under the platform.

235
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,066
It's small stuff.

236
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:41,525
- Nobody would get close to you.
- We'll pay you.

237
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:46,525
Only for a couple of days,
until the search stops.

238
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,108
What do you say?

239
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,858
There's more excavated stuff
under this bed

240
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,858
than in the Tarquinia museum.
Should I tell everyone?

241
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,816
There are two bronze statues
to pay the doctor.

242
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:01,483
That's good! Two are yours,
two are ours!

243
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,483
But when you sell yours,
you'll sell mine too.

244
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,441
Alright.

245
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,900
- Don't get caught.
- Don't worry.

246
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,275
Shut off the light, lock the door

247
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,733
and let me die in peace.

248
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,316
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Go get the pieces.

249
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,400
Thanks, Agony.

250
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:34,191
I heard that you are a good dancer.

251
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,525
I'm sorry to have
disappointed you again.

252
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:40,816
You're much more than a good dancer.
You're a delightful dancer.

253
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,650
Really delightful.

254
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,233
Reverend.

255
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,275
Reverend!

256
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,233
My uncle said

257
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,191
that if he catches the guy
who punched him, he'll shoot him.

258
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,900
Will you let me by, please?

259
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:08,191
- What manners!
- Get your hands off me!

260
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,566
Reverend, stop.
Where are you going?

261
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,816
Stop!

262
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:49,400
It's useless that you run away.
I recognized you.

263
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:52,233
You're pretending you don't know me?

264
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Then I'll go to the police.

265
00:20:55,566 --> 00:21:00,400
You'll stop wanting to go
to homes dressed as a friar,

266
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:03,483
swindling poor working people.

267
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,441
Let me explain how things stand.

268
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:10,233
I didn't look for you,
you looked for me.

269
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,150
You want to ruin me
for two cakes of cheese?

270
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,900
Six cheeses and 10,000 Liras.

271
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
- You are identical.
- To who?

272
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:24,066
To my passion, Lucio Battisti.

273
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,566
Is your hair real?
May I touch it?

274
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,191
Go ahead.

275
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:33,733
It is so fine.
Little curls, little curls!

276
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,816
When a man has a police record

277
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:42,316
or is reported to the police,

278
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,525
it's over for him.

279
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:48,066
He doesn't find a job anymore.

280
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,775
You're looking for a job?

281
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,900
Me? No!

282
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:56,483
- Don't you have a family?
- Asvero and I don't.

283
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,650
Lallo used to live with his sister.

284
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:02,900
A fat woman
with a very thin husband.

285
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:07,025
Then they kicked him out.
Sunflower has a grandmother.

286
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,608
You are no one's children.
And the blond one?

287
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:14,650
Asvero? He's the son of a German SS
who was hiding here.

288
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,233
- The other two and I are orphans.
- All of you?

289
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,483
Yes, both our parents. It's destiny!

290
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,983
Ever heard of
the Bonaventura shipwreck?

291
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,233
- No. What is it?
- It was a ship.

292
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,858
On it were many emigrants
from these parts.

293
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,608
Our parents
had boarded that boat too.

294
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:36,066
Luckily, we were little
and they left us at home,

295
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,650
or we'd have died too.

296
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,358
Get arrested. Uncle says that after
the slug, his eyesight weakened.

297
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:47,358
If he finds you, he'll shoot you.
What'll we do with this report?

298
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:50,733
I don't know.
I've opened up to you for an hour.

299
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,608
- Then you didn't understand.
- Ok, I'll see you tomorrow.

300
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:57,858
I can't tomorrow.
I am busy with my friends.

301
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,191
- Besides, you live far away.
- I have to go.

302
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:03,691
- Don't tell your uncle I saw you.
- I must think about it.

303
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,858
But Sunday I'll be back.

304
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,650
- What is your name?
- Curly.

305
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,483
What a name! My name is Pasquina.

306
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,358
My pleasure.

307
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,316
Yours isn't that great, either.

308
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,108
- Watch out!
- You throw it, then say "watch out"!

309
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:28,608
- Curly must cultivate her.
- It's easier said than done.

310
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,566
This piece is really lovely.

311
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:34,400
That pig is chasing her,
all horny!

312
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:38,691
- If he catches her...
- How will we take this stuff out?

313
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:42,775
- We must call Garrone.
- There are Agony's pieces too.

314
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:45,275
Yes, you promised him.

315
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:48,400
Lallo, how old do you think
Pasquina is?

316
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,066
Very old!

317
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:54,900
- She's in love with Lucio Battisti.
- And she makes a pass at you?

318
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,150
She says I look like him.

319
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:01,608
He is cute, you're disgusting.
You look like a monkey.

320
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,275
- So does she!
- You're ungrateful.

321
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:09,441
I sacrifice myself for you!
If it wasn't for me she'd report you.

322
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,900
She'd report us!

323
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:14,191
You're on the same team.

324
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:17,108
You gave her uncle a nice blow.

325
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,316
The police is outside Porta Romana
even at night.

326
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,483
The Finance Guards are at the bridge.

327
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,150
The Army, the Air Force...
Only the Navy is missing.

328
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:28,733
I have an idea
to take everything outside.

329
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,775
- Speak up.
- It's a real man's idea.

330
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:36,358
- Then it's nonsense.
- Remember what Agony said?

331
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:40,608
- Lallo, you say it.
- You, chicken, what'd Agony say?

332
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:44,316
- Don't make fun of me!
- Calm down!

333
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,191
He said,
"Let me die in peace."

334
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:51,733
- And so?
- Let's give him a hand.

335
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,025
- What's that mean?
- What does he want to do?

336
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:56,900
It seems he wants to kill him.

337
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:02,233
- You can go.
- Thank you.

338
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:04,733
Halt!

339
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,650
Excuse me. Let them by.

340
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,858
Just a moment.

341
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,650
Nothing. Go ahead, Father.

342
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:28,066
Proceed!

343
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,525
Go on, accelerate!

344
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,150
I'll take care of it, don't worry.

345
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:13,233
Why are you speeding? Darn you!

346
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,275
I hope your friend at the cafe
isn't involved in this deal.

347
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:21,483
- Novembersecond?
- Yes, that's him.

348
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,233
This just may be my idea,

349
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,566
but he doesn't bring good luck.
- Really?

350
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:32,358
It's the first time that
my brakes don't work.

351
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,358
Forget it. This time you made
a great deal.

352
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:41,775
- Curly is coming!
- Come with me.

353
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,066
Asvero, hurry.
The buyer is here too.

354
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,650
Let's go.

355
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,316
Follow me. I'll guide you.
Come here.

356
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,983
Now put it in reverse.

357
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,775
Come, Curly.

358
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,983
That's it.

359
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,650
Keep going.

360
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:17,108
- Good thing I was to keep going!
- Open, Sunflower.

361
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:20,566
Did you see? They made it.

362
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:25,233
There are 22 pieces.
You're an antique dealer, an expert.

363
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,775
This is a fortune!
Look at this Etruscan head.

364
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,941
- What about the procession?
- They're still running.

365
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,691
Hey! Let me out!

366
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:36,275
Please.

367
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,316
- Sir...
- Darn! Don't touch me!

368
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:44,566
- You forgot your money.
- Ask your friend.

369
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:48,816
- I dealt with him.
- See you on Sunday.

370
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:53,525
We'd agreed you'd give us
the money right away.

371
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,191
Asvero, Lallo,
let's stop the van!

372
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,566
Let's stop it!

373
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,650
- Stop it!
- Let's get the coffin!

374
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:03,316
Pull!

375
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:04,691
Easy!

376
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:07,025
We'll break everything!

377
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:09,025
Watch out!

378
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,566
They're all broken!

379
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,816
Imbeciles!

380
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:21,691
- Who did you say that to?
- To you.

381
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,233
- Me? I'll break you!
- You broke everything here!

382
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,066
Hurry. Pick them up, guys.
Look at that! Idiots!

383
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:35,150
- The head is intact.
- So is the big tear ampoule.

384
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,483
- Shall I collect these, too?
- Sure.

385
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,025
- Garrone!
- Pick them up, Lallo.

386
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:42,150
- What is it?
- Everything broke, huh?

387
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,775
I shouldn't have listened to you.
I want to leave.

388
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,400
Sir, please.

389
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:51,775
It's a matter of honor.
You must not mortify me.

390
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:55,858
The head and amphora are intact.
It's almost all intact.

391
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,525
You'll check the findings in Rome
and give me what I want.

392
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,108
As long as we leave.
Have them moved!

393
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:05,691
I'll come back Sunday
and we'll fix everything up.

394
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:07,691
Honk!

395
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,858
- Honk the horn!
- They won't move.

396
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,900
Honk the horn!

397
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,150
Trust me.

398
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:17,775
I'm humiliated by this! Ready, sir!

399
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,483
- Will he bring the money Sunday?
- I don't think so.

400
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,400
He better not dare!

401
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,483
I've been closed in here for 3 hours.

402
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,525
Let me out!

403
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,483
You're making my head spin!

404
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:27,275
Darn you!
I don't want to stay here.

405
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:31,191
I wanted to die as a real gentleman.

406
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,608
But the funeral wasn't worth
jack shit.

407
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,275
I wanted an engraved coffin

408
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:41,608
but had a poor man's one.
- Come on, Agony!

409
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,816
And the bishop? Where was he?

410
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:48,483
Not even the priest wanted
to come to your home!

411
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,733
To have the coffin enter
the church, he wanted 5,000 Liras.

412
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,441
- And we paid.
- And the flowers?

413
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:59,941
The wreath was so little,
it looked like a toilet seat.

414
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:03,191
- Agony, this is your season.
- Take these cigarettes.

415
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:06,275
- Leave me alone.
- Let's dance.

416
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,025
Darn you.
You're not following the rhythm.

417
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:19,150
Guys, let's go home
or we'll be late.

418
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:21,525
Have a drop, young man.

419
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,525
May lightning strike you!

420
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,066
Sunflower, you're leaving me alone?

421
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,233
Leave me that animal, at least.

422
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:37,983
- Here. Don't lose it.
- He's better than people.

423
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,691
- Wait for me!
- We'll return Saturday with food!

424
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,358
- What more do you want?
- You don't want women, do you?

425
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:48,525
Send them over.
No woman has ever complained.

426
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:51,316
Curly, wait for me!

427
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,691
Good morning, Nadia.

428
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,275
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Naturally.

429
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,483
I came to get your daughter.

430
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,441
- What will you do with her?
- I want to get her pregnant.

431
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,441
Annunziata isn't here.
You can try the second one.

432
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:08,775
The second one?
I'll take a look at her.

433
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:12,150
Too bad!
Annunziata and I got along.

434
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:14,650
Antonietta, come!

435
00:33:14,816 --> 00:33:16,483
Here I am.

436
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,233
- What do you want?
- My gosh!

437
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,025
She is too thin.
What'll I do with her?

438
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:29,150
She has narrow hips.

439
00:33:29,316 --> 00:33:33,275
- No offense, but she won't do.
- And so...

440
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:37,316
Sir, look at me.
I have wide hips.

441
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,900
Annunziata's clothes
are too tight for me.

442
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,483
How old is she? She's little.

443
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,233
- 15. When will you bring her back?
- We'll go to Zagarolo tonight.

444
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,233
- Does she know what to do?
- Annunziata is more expert...

445
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,025
Alright.

446
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:01,650
Lilletta, come, pretty girl.

447
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,233
Come.

448
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,733
Go with him now.

449
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,983
Keep this tight. Don't let it go.

450
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,525
Four, five, six and seven.

451
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:16,150
No more left.

452
00:34:16,316 --> 00:34:18,066
Now get inside.

453
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:20,941
There.

454
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,150
Put on the wedding band. Here.

455
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:52,275
- Hold your stomach, idiot.
- I knew the clothes were too few.

456
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,441
Of course!
There are more pieces than clothes.

457
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:23,233
Good morning. Where are you headed?

458
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
- Zagarolo.
- Good.

459
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,816
Aren't you Tirelli Nereo,
son of Alcide,

460
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:31,691
from Lugano,
and resident of Colle Civitella?

461
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:33,275
Yes.

462
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:36,858
- Why is a pregnant girl in there?
- Her? She is my wife.

463
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:41,900
She seems too young, huh?
She fell in love and wanted me.

464
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:45,358
- This is the lieutenant.
- I am not a lieutenant.

465
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,441
De Crescenzo!
Help the lady get down.

466
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,025
- Yes, sir.
- She can't travel like this.

467
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:56,275
- I'll accompany her to San Germano.
- I see.

468
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:59,775
Weren't you previously married?

469
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,358
Yes, but since I'm waiting for...
that thing... a divorce.

470
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:06,566
- I already did that other thing.
- I can tell you did!

471
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,566
The separation.

472
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:13,191
- Dear.
- Come.

473
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:15,358
Don't be afraid. Come.

474
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:20,066
Don't worry, dear.
The lieutenant will accompany you.

475
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,025
- I'm not a lieutenant.
- You have a lieutenant's build.

476
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:26,733
- But not the rank yet.
- She's not disturbing, huh?

477
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
- It's our duty.
- Should I go?

478
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:32,691
Go. The lieutenant
will accompany you to Zagarolo.

479
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,983
- Follow me with the car.
- Sure. You'll be more comfortable.

480
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,566
Even if I wanted to work,
what could I do?

481
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:44,358
My cousin is mason head
for the Subiaco dam works.

482
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:46,900
I can talk to him if you want.

483
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:50,400
He can get you a job,
maybe unloading bricks.

484
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:54,233
- Bricks?
- That's how my cousin began.

485
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,650
As long as it's a steady job.

486
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:03,108
These are tough times
and it could be a solution.

487
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,441
- If your cousin hired all of us...
- All of us, who?

488
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:09,066
Me, Lallo, Asvero and Sunflower.

489
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,941
Stop!
Then I should be a slave!

490
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:22,108
Not bricks, but you can't go on
being a reverend or undertaker.

491
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:26,900
You're of a certain age now.
You must think about a family.

492
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:30,566
Darn these curls!

493
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:34,191
So fine! Little curls, little curls!

494
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:37,816
You look a lot like him.

495
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:44,150
- Have you ever tried singing?
- I sing off tune.

496
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:46,316
What are you doing? Stop it.

497
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,066
Come on!

498
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:52,650
- Did I hurt you?
- Not you, the bike.

499
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,275
Calm down.
Let's postpone till Sunday!

500
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,275
Isn't it the same thing?

501
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:00,275
You don't feel anything?

502
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:06,108
I'm sacrificing myself. This morning
I had to put up with her.

503
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,525
She certainly isn't beautiful,
and she's not a young girl,

504
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:13,900
but she dresses elegantly
and has a certain class.

505
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:17,233
Asvero, Curly is right.

506
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,775
You may be tall, handsome,
blond and thin,

507
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:23,983
but you're a jackass!
Here. Pick a card.

508
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,233
- Thank you.
- Get out!

509
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,358
Sunflower, where did you go?

510
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:37,108
- Hey!
- Leave me alone.

511
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,775
- Why didn't you come with us today?
- I've a family, my grandma.

512
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:44,400
I provide for her.
You people always joke around.

513
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:48,400
Us? Now you're acting up
because you have a grandma.

514
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,400
Do you have 100 Liras?

515
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:53,858
I'll return it.

516
00:38:56,566 --> 00:39:00,941
It makes me furious that Garrone
owes us over 200,000 Liras

517
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,691
and we owe each other money.

518
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,900
As if it bothered you!

519
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:09,066
He never swindles others, only us.

520
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:11,733
- He says he's a friend.
- He was a friend.

521
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,900
It's the consumed tentacle
civilization of the big city

522
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,150
that ruined him.

523
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:21,483
He's the custodian at the wax museum,
not the director.

524
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,608
Getting swindled by a custodian...

525
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:27,233
Nobody swindles Curly.

526
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,441
You think I don't know
the road to Rome?

527
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:33,983
- Sure. It's not abroad.
- So should we go?

528
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,233
- It's necessary.
- Then go there.

529
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,566
- You're sending me alone?
- No.

530
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,858
In fact, we're leaving tonight.

531
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,108
- Well said, Curly.
- What did I say?

532
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:46,233
It's necessary.

533
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,358
- What happened?
- Nothing.

534
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,233
Now it's your turn to drive.

535
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,983
- What time is it?
- Time for you to wake up.

536
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:31,066
- What happened?
- I want to sleep too.

537
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,066
- The battery.
- Damn it!

538
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:52,983
Is Pasquina that ugly?

539
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,025
- She looks like an alley cat.
- Come on, push!

540
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,358
Don't laugh like imbeciles!

541
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,400
Asvero is better off than anyone.

542
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:07,566
Do you believe his father was
a German captain, a baron?

543
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,316
He's the son of a filthy SS.

544
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:13,566
And his mother? We don't know.

545
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,733
She could look for him one day
and find him.

546
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,983
Maybe he's the son of a marquise!

547
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,025
He's not the son of a marquise.

548
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:26,108
- He's the son of a bitch!
- Stop, Asvero!

549
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:32,608
He didn't stop.

550
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,191
He stopped!

551
00:41:50,483 --> 00:41:53,191
Good thing you came,
or I would have come.

552
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,400
I must tell you about an
important deal. Where're the others?

553
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:59,650
- Call Asvero and Sunflower.
- Hurry.

554
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:04,358
July 23, 1943,
the Grand Council's last session.

555
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,691
- Hi, Sunflower.
- Good morning.

556
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,233
- What is the deal?
- What's it about?

557
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,483
A big grave in which
a German professor is involved.

558
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,566
We know your plans.

559
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:20,316
I'm never wrong about these things.
This time I bet everything.

560
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:23,733
- Even our money?
- Yes, in your interest.

561
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,608
You could've asked us.

562
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:31,150
- You always do as you please.
- Oh, come on!

563
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,858
With those broken pieces
I didn't even get half.

564
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,066
- Give us half.
- At least 100,000.

565
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:39,441
- Give it to us.
- Then you didn't understand.

566
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,691
You don't know what
we can find in there.

567
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:46,316
Who will buy the part
we're entitled to?

568
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,316
The dealer, I guarantee.

569
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,900
If you're not interested,
consider it a loan.

570
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:55,066
Maybe a personal loan.

571
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:58,608
- You don't trust me?
- Me? Oh, sure!

572
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:03,900
I even told them.
"Why bother going to Rome?"

573
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:08,358
- "Let's forget it."
- Garrone, you screwed us again.

574
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:12,066
You can't go now. You travelled
all night. I'll take care of it.

575
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:16,441
Thanks, but we don't want to bother.
We'll sleep in the van.

576
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:20,566
No bother. You can sleep here
until noon.

577
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:23,316
I'll wake you when
the cleaning women come.

578
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,775
- One can sleep in Rommel's tent.
- Who is he?

579
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:29,650
- General Rommel.
- Are there two beds?

580
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:35,525
No. He never sleeps. He watches the
dunes looking for an enemy ambush.

581
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,566
Here it is. A real camp bed.

582
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:44,233
This tent is lovely.

583
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,108
- Where do I sleep?
- It's hard!

584
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:50,483
- I'll fix you all up.
- I'll sleep here.

585
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,775
- Lallo, come.
- Wake me up!

586
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:56,858
Don't leave me here.

587
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,066
- Curly, come here.
- Garrone!

588
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:01,233
Have a good rest.
Take off your shoes.

589
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,900
- You'll have him sleep in the john?
- How ignorant!

590
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:07,900
- That is Marie Antoinette's boudoir.
- It stinks in here!

591
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,691
- You'll sleep at the casino.
- With sluts?

592
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:13,441
The casino where you gamble.

593
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:15,650
Now we'll move "moustache".

594
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,775
There. Try it.

595
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:27,191
- It seems a bit tight.
- You are real nuisances!

596
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,608
Oh, God!
Did I die and go to hell?

597
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:47,733
You think I should be in hell?

598
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,566
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
save my heart and soul.

599
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:54,066
When you used to see me,
you didn't call the saints.

600
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,650
You won't leave me alone
even after your death?

601
00:44:56,816 --> 00:44:59,316
Isn't it enough
that you ruined my youth?

602
00:44:59,483 --> 00:45:02,400
Disappear, you cursed soul!
I'll have a mass said for you.

603
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,150
Have it said for your grandson.

604
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,900
When I catch him and his friends...

605
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,775
That delinquent, Sunflower!

606
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,066
This vegetable soup
is the first taste of food

607
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,066
after a week of fasting.

608
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:20,691
What do you want from me?
Don't you see I am old?

609
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:24,441
Only a cat took pity on me

610
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:27,608
and let me eat it
without complaining.

611
00:45:29,275 --> 00:45:35,066
Last night the tide took
my trousers and underpants.

612
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,150
I'll show you I don't have them.
Are you alone at home?

613
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:43,025
Go back to hell,
you tempting ghost! Go!

614
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:48,483
- You check on me now?
- No, I am yours now.

615
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,191
I couldn't resist you.
Just think if my uncle knew!

616
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:56,566
Come on, get inside.

617
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:01,316
I talked to my cousin.

618
00:46:01,483 --> 00:46:04,900
The job is yours.
You can go on Monday.

619
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,733
Are you happy?

620
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,816
You can work extra time too.

621
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:11,525
Yeah!

622
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:17,233
- Let's go to your house.
- No. I sleep here in the garage.

623
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,275
Come on. I'll take you to the bus.

624
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:32,108
- What are you doing?
- Turn in here.

625
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,608
Where are you going?
Hurry, the bus will leave.

626
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:50,900
She always thinks of the same thing.

627
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:03,066
They are so lovely...

628
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,108
Little curls, little curls!

629
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:12,025
What do you want to do?
Filthy pig!

630
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:16,275
Help! The brake
is between my thighs.

631
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:18,566
- I'll move it.
- I will move it!

632
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:22,108
- Stop!
- Stop it! Oh, God!

633
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:29,858
They're organized people from
the north. With machine guns...

634
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:31,858
They have money.

635
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,566
Everyone steals today.

636
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:40,816
If I were rich, I wouldn't steal.

637
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,775
It means you've already stolen
or that your father stole.

638
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:47,650
Why? Can't someone become rich
just by working?

639
00:47:47,816 --> 00:47:51,691
No. If you work, you don't
have time to make money.

640
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:54,775
You either work or make money.
They're different things.

641
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:59,316
Then why don't we have money
if we don't work?

642
00:47:59,483 --> 00:48:03,275
We never thought of
doing a 300 million hit.

643
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:08,608
Where can you find 300 million
in these parts?

644
00:48:08,775 --> 00:48:13,775
You say I'm a jackass, but I think
there's 300 million over there.

645
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:19,233
The Etruscan museum.
What an idea!

646
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,566
- Are you crazy?
- More than 300 million!

647
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,566
- It's my turn.
- Over there...

648
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,400
Get down.

649
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:28,816
- Stuff worth billions!
- What are you saying?

650
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:33,150
The Etruscan castle museum
is a fortress.

651
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:46,275
For such a hit,
we'd need the hole gang.

652
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:50,275
What hole?
We're already four.

653
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:52,400
I agree. Four of us...

654
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:54,525
Two. Lallo and I don't count.

655
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,608
Why not? Am I a jerk?

656
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:58,733
Say it! Am I a jerk?

657
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,858
- I'm not getting into this.
- I'd say you are.

658
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:04,775
- I was saying it for you.
- I decide for myself.

659
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,733
I'm in.

660
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,358
- No, I'm not.
- We'd have a sure future.

661
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:15,275
We could stop being
grave robbers.

662
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:18,733
- We could travel.
- We could do anything.

663
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,108
You and your grandma
could come out of the tomb.

664
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,525
I said no.

665
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:26,858
You want a candy?

666
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:31,566
- You're not ambitious.
- That's how I am.

667
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:34,733
- If you unwrap it, it's better.
- Curly, you tell him.

668
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,608
It would be a dream,
like going to "Calcubo".

669
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:39,941
- Acapulco!
- Same thing.

670
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:42,108
London! Spain!

671
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,775
I'd go to Hawaii.

672
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:49,608
So you're in too.

673
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:53,900
No. The hit is too difficult.

674
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:02,150
See that?
It's the alarm system.

675
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:05,316
They have an alarm system.

676
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:08,025
I noticed. It's nonsense.

677
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:10,775
Look at the windows' locks.

678
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:16,733
Asvero, look at that door.
Check if it looks out on the alley.

679
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,066
There's the john where I will hide.

680
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:23,316
In fact, I'll go now.
I have to pee.

681
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:25,233
You keep on insisting?

682
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:37,025
Now we know there are
only two custodians.

683
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:40,483
- By the cash register and by...
- The john.

684
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,025
No, by the deer of Veio.

685
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:44,691
Let's recap.

686
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,483
The entrance is here. What is this?

687
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,233
- A cockroach.
- No. I mean, what is here?

688
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,025
The terrace.

689
00:50:54,191 --> 00:50:57,400
Exactly. If someone stays
inside the museum after closing time,

690
00:50:57,566 --> 00:51:01,150
goes on the terrace and drops a rope,
where does he end up?

691
00:51:01,316 --> 00:51:04,483
- In jail.
- Sunflower, be quiet.

692
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,650
- So where does he end up?
- I'll explain.

693
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:13,108
Down there, on the beach,
while the other remains inside.

694
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:15,525
He remains inside.

695
00:51:15,691 --> 00:51:18,775
- There's no use talking to you.
- Yeah, right.

696
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:22,275
- Wait, Curly.
- Let's just forget it.

697
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:25,983
- No, go on. I am interested.
- You can't talk to certain people.

698
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,608
- Talk to us.
- I can't waste time.

699
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:34,025
I know them. If they catch you,
they'll bust your ass!

700
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:00,400
Pour.

701
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:03,983
- To Lallo's new home.
- Modestly speaking...

702
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,108
- To the big museum hit!
- What'll you do with all that money?

703
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:10,900
Go to Berlin. Maybe I'll find my dad.
I've the address of a castle.

704
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:14,525
I'll go to America,
so the affair with Pasquina will end,

705
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:16,983
including her cousin's bricks.

706
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,358
You'll leave me by myself?

707
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:23,775
I must tell you something.
I don't think it's correct.

708
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,858
First you seduce her
and then you leave her?

709
00:52:27,025 --> 00:52:30,150
- Yes, you went to bed with her.
- Me?

710
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,941
- Don't make me talk.
- Come on, tell us.

711
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:37,441
Did she rape you?
What did she do?

712
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:40,608
I can't talk. You don't understand.

713
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:43,733
- This is a personal matter.
- Come on, among friends...

714
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,733
I can't. You know me.

715
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,733
I am a gentleman.

716
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,441
Lallo, be quiet.
He's told us 2,000 times.

717
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:55,816
Let's talk about
tomorrow's rehearsal.

718
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:57,816
Here's the blueprint.

719
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,525
- Remember the established time?
- I don't.

720
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:03,483
- 5:15 p.m.
- I'll continue.

721
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,441
I will hide in the museum john

722
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:10,066
to make sure we can leave
after closing time.

723
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:15,525
Meanwhile, Lallo will watch over
the museum entrance

724
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:19,816
to establish the exact time
one of the custodians gets off work.

725
00:53:19,983 --> 00:53:24,275
He is leaving. Run, Lallo! Move!

726
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:35,025
Asvero, only one custodian
is left now.

727
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:37,900
Just go.

728
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:40,025
Act normal.

729
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:49,608
Hurry. Don't look.

730
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,525
Don't close the door!

731
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,816
Hurry. Drop down the rope.

732
00:54:00,066 --> 00:54:01,650
Hurry.

733
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,816
Meanwhile, Sunflower
stays on the beach. So...

734
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:12,816
Go on, Sunflower, a wild cat's leap.

735
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:16,066
With great speed and promptness.

736
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,900
The fourth man will climb
the wall,

737
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:22,233
agile as a squirrel
in the forest.

738
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:26,400
A squirrel? Jerk!

739
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,566
I knew it.

740
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,733
Meanwhile, another enters
the service door that I've opened.

741
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,441
- While another...
- You keep saying "another".

742
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:37,608
There are only four of us.

743
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,900
Another guy who should cut the wires
and open the showcases.

744
00:54:41,066 --> 00:54:43,525
And one who pulls up
the baskets from the beach.

745
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:46,066
Darn! We're not enough!

746
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,483
We need other men.

747
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,441
- I told you.
- One, two, three, four...

748
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:55,025
- At least another four men.
See? It can't be done.

749
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:59,525
It doesn't matter. Let's drink to it.
Maybe next time.

750
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,441
I had a great idea.

751
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:07,816
But we've organized everything.
We even bought gloves.

752
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,816
- We must find accomplices.
- What do you say, Sunflower?

753
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:14,316
- I'm not getting into it.
- I know who can help us.

754
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:17,650
I'll get dressed and in 10 minutes
we'll meet at the cafe.

755
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:43,941
Well?

756
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:45,816
What do you need?

757
00:55:45,983 --> 00:55:48,025
What is it, Curly?

758
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:53,900
- You talk, Asvero.
- No, you talk.

759
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:56,066
- I won't talk.
- I didn't ask you.

760
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,108
You were looking at me.

761
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:01,316
It's all been planned, Mr. Nereo.

762
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,816
- Folder.
- Folder.

763
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:08,108
We took the liberty of bringing you
a gift. It's small.

764
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:11,816
- We prepared everything.
- I think it's a tough hit.

765
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:13,775
- Be quiet.
- At the museum.

766
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:17,316
- The Etruscan museum.
- Don't worry. There is no risk.

767
00:56:17,483 --> 00:56:20,983
We calculated everything.
I'll explain. This is the entrance.

768
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,983
There are two custodians, but...

769
00:56:29,316 --> 00:56:31,775
Do you need other men?

770
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:33,983
We're almost four.

771
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:38,900
We need another four.

772
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:41,483
Why did you turn to me?

773
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,650
They say that you,
despite everything...

774
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,941
Stop! Despite?

775
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:49,483
No, Sunflower made a mistake.

776
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,941
He meant, "after all".

777
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,441
After all, you are the only person
on the level of this...

778
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:00,775
At this very important level.

779
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:04,608
Curly is right. When we must sell
all this stuff abroad...

780
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:08,191
You are known abroad.
Lugano, Geneva...

781
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,400
You are the only one in this town.

782
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:14,191
It's either you, or we can forget it.

783
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:17,400
- We didn't have a choice.
- Be quiet.

784
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:21,858
Alright. We'll share in equal parts.

785
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:24,775
- Four parts to you, four to me.
- Half?

786
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,525
If you think it's too much,
take your folder back.

787
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:30,733
- And the hen?
- Alright, half.

788
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,191
I understood.
I'll take care of the four men.

789
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:37,275
We need Lock Pick
who was recently released.

790
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:39,900
Pigface has a rigged van.

791
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:42,441
Lightning is good
for filling baskets.

792
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:46,358
And Speed, to the rope.
He worked in a circus.

793
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:49,316
I'll keep the folder.

794
00:57:56,816 --> 00:58:01,983
Excuse me. Marshal, do you
recognize me? I'm Nereo Tirelli.

795
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,358
- Come. How is the bride?
- Who?

796
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:07,066
- Your wife.
- Oh, yes. She is...

797
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,941
- It's almost time, huh?
- It sure is!

798
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:13,316
Finally you came to see us.

799
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:16,691
Dolfin, take the Tirelli file.

800
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:19,275
It's among the controlled
grave robbers.

801
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:22,191
What happened to you?

802
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:25,066
- A conscience crisis?
- Here.

803
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,358
Let's take a look.

804
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:31,233
"From the transcription
of the last six years..."

805
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,483
"Article 407 of the Penal Code
for trespassing of sepulcher."

806
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,775
"Year: one, with conditional."

807
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:39,566
"Article 411,
unburial of corpse..."

808
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:42,108
Yes.

809
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:49,066
- A rascal's prank!
- "Usurping of titles."

810
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,233
"An 80,000 Liras fine."

811
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,608
And finally, a recent fine report.

812
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:58,733
It's the drop
that has the vase overflow.

813
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,983
Dolfin, write.
Three copies and tracing paper.

814
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,066
- Write.
- Please.

815
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:09,483
Yesterday, at about 4 p.m.
four emissaries, dangerous men

816
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:14,483
of an international gang,
came to my home

817
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,150
submitting a very profitable
deal to me.

818
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:23,275
Since you could recuperate
important Etruscan findings,

819
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:28,775
let me ask you,
what would I get from this?

820
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,441
I don't understand.

821
00:59:33,608 --> 00:59:38,608
If a Finance marshal,
waiting for a promotion,

822
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:43,525
foresees and stops a big heist
of Etruscan artifacts,

823
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:46,858
does he get promoted or not?

824
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:51,733
Yes, he gets promoted.

825
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,525
So what do I gain
with this information?

826
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:03,608
Dolfin, what are you doing?
Are you writing?

827
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:07,275
- You told me to.
- Go out there.

828
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,066
Close the door.

829
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:10,733
Stupid!

830
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:23,816
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

831
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:26,066
- Cappuccino?
- No.

832
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:29,108
This is something big.

833
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:33,150
Just think if the Carabinieri
of Colle Civitella found out.

834
01:00:33,316 --> 01:00:35,900
Marshall Capriotti!
I was just imagining...

835
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:40,275
Did you know he arrested
two criminals under my jurisdiction?

836
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:43,358
I went to bed at 5 a.m.
He is a vampire!

837
01:00:43,525 --> 01:00:47,358
He always tries
to screw the Finance Guards.

838
01:00:47,525 --> 01:00:51,233
He descends from the mountains
like a wolf, and trespasses!

839
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,816
- He is arrogant.
- It's true.

840
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,608
In fact, marshal.
Think it over carefully.

841
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:10,816
- Here...
- Who is the boss?

842
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:13,566
We don't know who the boss is.

843
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:17,900
We only know
he's an international big shot.

844
01:01:18,066 --> 01:01:20,150
But you could get him
at the refinery

845
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:23,775
where he will pick up
the stolen goods.

846
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:26,275
- Is that clear?
- Of course.

847
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:30,358
- Then give me two men.
- What men?

848
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:32,733
Two men who...

849
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,358
- Boteon! Santolin! Finance Guards.
- Present.

850
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:42,941
Santolin is the most intelligent
and Boteon is the fastest.

851
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,191
They don't seem too bright to me.

852
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:49,108
Let's hope for the best.

853
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,816
Officer,
is the marshal in his office?

854
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:02,191
- No, he's in church.
- Thank you.

855
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,816
What do I get out of it?

856
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:29,900
The boss will probably
come from abroad,

857
01:02:30,066 --> 01:02:33,025
maybe in a helicopter.
He is a very important person.

858
01:02:33,191 --> 01:02:37,691
This time it's not about
two vases or a few bronze statues.

859
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:42,191
This is an international
organization.

860
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,191
Think about it.

861
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:46,816
In exchange,
what should I do for you?

862
01:02:46,983 --> 01:02:50,441
Get rid of surveillance
and return my passport.

863
01:02:50,608 --> 01:02:52,233
I can't.

864
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,441
Just think if the Finance Guard
found out.

865
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,275
You are Lock Pick
and you are Pigface.

866
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:04,900
Couldn't I be Lock Pick?

867
01:03:05,066 --> 01:03:07,816
Pigface is more suited to him.

868
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:10,733
- How dare you?
- It doesn't matter.

869
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,441
What matters is that you
don't arouse suspicion.

870
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:54,275
Act indifferently. The gang guys
just passed behind you.

871
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:57,108
I'd arrest those two right away.

872
01:03:57,275 --> 01:04:02,816
We must catch the whole gang,
above all the gang boss.

873
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:05,691
They've such hoodlum faces!

874
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:10,108
They're supposedly
the shrewdest in the gang.

875
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:34,900
Follow me, please.

876
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:39,358
Father Cosimo! Father!

877
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:42,066
Father, I wanted to say hello.

878
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,733
- What a fall!
- The priest fell.

879
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,983
- Help me.
- Your hat.

880
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,275
Father, did you get hurt?

881
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:53,566
I'm leaving, going to Switzerland.

882
01:04:53,733 --> 01:04:57,108
- Father, do you need anything?
- No, I don't.

883
01:04:57,275 --> 01:05:00,150
Understand? Nothing! This jinx!

884
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:03,816
I'll return in spring, like swallows.

885
01:05:05,566 --> 01:05:10,566
Marshal, the museum
doesn't risk anything.

886
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:15,441
Jackass. We'll give you
the key ourselves.

887
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:21,566
- What?
- The hit must be successful.

888
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:23,775
It absolutely must.

889
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:27,900
- We thought...
- Don't think. Only I think.

890
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:30,150
I'd like to arrest them only if...

891
01:05:30,316 --> 01:05:34,566
We must catch
the organization's boss.

892
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:37,608
He is the big fish!
I don't care about those idiots.

893
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:41,608
- We should steal with them?
- Yes!

894
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,525
You still don't understand?

895
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:48,066
There are alarm systems
that go off.

896
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:52,233
- They could arrest us.
- Arrest police officers?

897
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,691
We're not sure anymore.

898
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:57,150
Who will protect us?

899
01:05:57,316 --> 01:05:59,525
What's important

900
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:02,983
is that you scrupulously follow

901
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:06,691
the schedule I established. Come!

902
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:13,900
With my changes,
I think the hit is perfect now.

903
01:06:14,066 --> 01:06:17,566
For the alarm signal,
we could call an electrician.

904
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:19,941
And we'll fix the matter.

905
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:22,150
Let's go on. What's left?

906
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,608
The showcase window keys?

907
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:28,150
We'll call Trentin
who is also a blacksmith.

908
01:06:28,316 --> 01:06:31,775
He'll take care of it. Let's go on.

909
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:35,816
When we leave with the stolen items,
there's a guard at the intersection.

910
01:06:35,983 --> 01:06:39,191
That won't worry us.
I'll call the guard here.

911
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:41,983
If it's necessary.
I'll hold him here a few days.

912
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,191
- And the watches?
- Right.

913
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:48,691
We'll use the Swiss ones
we confiscated from the Neapolitans.

914
01:06:48,858 --> 01:06:51,566
- My uncle forgave you.
- Why?

915
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:55,691
I'll explain.
I told him that you'd marry me,

916
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:59,358
and he said, "Are you sure?"

917
01:06:59,525 --> 01:07:01,900
I replied, "As long as
you don't kill him".

918
01:07:02,066 --> 01:07:06,191
He said, "I'm not that senile".
We'll get married!

919
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,066
- I am busy now.
- We'll crown our dream of love.

920
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,191
- My friends are waiting for me.
- Abandon yourself.

921
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:15,066
- Come on!
- What is it?

922
01:07:15,233 --> 01:07:18,983
I see. Your friends
don't like me.

923
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:23,150
No. They always talk about you
and your uncle.

924
01:07:23,316 --> 01:07:26,816
- They'll be happy if we marry.
- I must ask them first.

925
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:29,775
What? They're not
your father and mother.

926
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,525
No, but they are...

927
01:07:32,691 --> 01:07:34,983
Listen to me, and reason.

928
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,483
On one side you have me.

929
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,358
I have a farm with two cows,
three pigs, a donkey,

930
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:43,150
23 hens and a home
with tv set and refrigerator.

931
01:07:43,316 --> 01:07:45,483
There's enough for a nice future.

932
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,900
I know.

933
01:07:47,066 --> 01:07:50,858
On the other side,
there are 3 scoundrels, losers,

934
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,108
who sooner or later
will end up in jail.

935
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:57,900
- Now you must choose.
- Now?

936
01:07:58,066 --> 01:08:00,358
Yes, now.

937
01:08:00,525 --> 01:08:02,941
Either them or me.
Who do you choose?

938
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:06,400
I've already thought about it.
I'm no longer a kid.

939
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:09,483
It's what I think too.

940
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,608
One must give importance
to important things in life.

941
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:15,650
I'm sorry, but you are right.
We must be men.

942
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:19,275
- I knew I'd enchained you.
- What did you understand?

943
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:22,483
- You mean you choose your friends?
- Of course.

944
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,025
You scoundrel!
Who do you think you are?

945
01:08:26,191 --> 01:08:29,108
You're a poor loser,
and I didn't want to humiliate you.

946
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:32,316
But you don't look like
Lucio Battisti at all.

947
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,900
- Who gives a darn!
- He is a gentleman.

948
01:08:36,066 --> 01:08:38,316
Here, you ugly son of a bitch!

949
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:42,816
Does a contrasting love
last so little?

950
01:08:42,983 --> 01:08:45,566
First little curls, little curls,
and now...

951
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:47,691
Lice hair! Here!

952
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,858
Damn you!

953
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,816
And I even think you're a fag.

954
01:08:52,983 --> 01:08:55,566
- Fuck off.
- You deceived a young girl!

955
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:58,108
I could be your grandson
you're so old.

956
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:03,233
Lallo is right in saying
that you're an alley cat.

957
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,358
Take this!

958
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:10,816
And this is for those scoundrel
friends of yours!

959
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:18,566
How much will they give us
for 300 million?

960
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:23,233
Asvero, if they catch us,
how much do you think we'll get?

961
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:28,608
Two years ago, just for one head,
Vittorio got 6 months.

962
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:30,900
Then we'll get life in prison.

963
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:34,525
- They have to catch us first.
- Sunflower, you feel like laughing?

964
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:39,150
No, like crying.
The guards scare me.

965
01:09:39,316 --> 01:09:41,858
Stay put, Curly.

966
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:44,816
We'll go to the refinery.
Novembersecond is there.

967
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:46,858
We'll hand it all over him.

968
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:51,150
Black cockroach was right.
What's his name...? Pigface.

969
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:53,066
It's just a matter of time.

970
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:56,275
They even gave us
four cool watches.

971
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:58,525
You can tell
they're real criminals.

972
01:09:58,691 --> 01:10:00,983
That blond guy has
a real thief's face.

973
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:05,025
Even if they catch us,
it's still robbery.

974
01:10:05,191 --> 01:10:07,733
- With breaking in.
- Lallo, what do you say?

975
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,316
Anything is fine with me.

976
01:10:11,483 --> 01:10:16,483
But Lock Pick is armed and has
a gun this big under his jacket.

977
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:21,733
Armed robbery. Did we forget
anything else?

978
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,483
I don't want to back out,
but let's leave Sunflower out of it.

979
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,275
That's right!

980
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:36,566
I am not afraid of jail,
I'm afraid of getting beat up.

981
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,983
So... Here.

982
01:10:42,566 --> 01:10:44,358
Take the watch back.

983
01:10:47,066 --> 01:10:49,191
Wait for me, Sunflower.

984
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:52,816
I changed my mind.
I'm staying with Sunflower.

985
01:10:56,566 --> 01:11:00,775
Curly, we're alone, and we're few.
What can I say?

986
01:11:01,483 --> 01:11:04,066
- You too?
- You do it.

987
01:11:04,733 --> 01:11:09,066
You always say
you're worth all of us. Do it!

988
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:13,941
- You scums. You'll leave me?
- He's offended.

989
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:16,816
You can't leave me. Beggars!

990
01:11:16,983 --> 01:11:20,400
I am your boss. Stop!

991
01:11:20,566 --> 01:11:23,650
- I order you!
- Curly.

992
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:27,608
Damn you!

993
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:31,316
That alley cat was right.
I'll bust you!

994
01:11:35,275 --> 01:11:38,441
You have to be born
for certain things.

995
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:41,733
Think it over carefully.

996
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,691
- You are cowards.
- No, it's a matter of friendship.

997
01:11:44,858 --> 01:11:46,900
- What's that mean?
- Forget it.

998
01:11:47,066 --> 01:11:49,483
- No, speak up.
- Reason.

999
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:53,191
Sunflower doesn't feel up to it,
and I think he is right.

1000
01:11:53,358 --> 01:11:56,275
It's a big hit,
but it's not for us.

1001
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:59,525
I can't explain it, but I'm convinced

1002
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
that if we don't stay united,

1003
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,566
our friendship will end. Right?

1004
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:12,525
The friendship would have ended
even if we'd made the hit.

1005
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:15,191
- Why?
- The money!

1006
01:12:15,358 --> 01:12:18,983
You'll go to America,
Asvero to Berlin to find his dad,

1007
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:23,900
Lallo will return to Rome to open
a restaurant, and I'll be alone.

1008
01:12:24,066 --> 01:12:28,566
I've a grandma.
She's old and I can't expatriate.

1009
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:38,150
Who will tell the others?

1010
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,275
They beat me up.

1011
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:46,858
Look, touch. Please.

1012
01:12:47,025 --> 01:12:51,858
- There's a scar.
- The Finance Guard did it.

1013
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:57,108
It couldn't have been.
A policeman did it.

1014
01:12:57,275 --> 01:12:59,108
They used a club.

1015
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:02,900
They never had a club.

1016
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:06,858
- What do you care?
- You're arguing now?

1017
01:13:07,025 --> 01:13:10,650
For a pigeon, like kids.
A live pigeon who I wanted to keep.

1018
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:15,150
Since then, he's been scared.
He can't help it.

1019
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:18,025
The four of us
are always together.

1020
01:13:18,191 --> 01:13:21,525
We don't want to create problems.
You understand...

1021
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:23,691
What do you want to do?

1022
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,858
We've decided.
We're backing out.

1023
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:31,733
I can assure you that
in article 442 of the Penal Code,

1024
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,775
law of April 7, 1962,
you'd get a minimum sentence.

1025
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:39,066
- It's the minimum.
- Yes, but not the beatings.

1026
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:44,191
- And so?
- So "one hand washes the other".

1027
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:48,983
You're in that field,
you should understand.

1028
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,775
- We must do that hit.
- Alone?

1029
01:13:52,941 --> 01:13:55,400
You are four.

1030
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:58,275
You always say that one of you
is worth two of us.

1031
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:02,566
- So you are eight.
- But we must inform the boss.

1032
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:06,566
He doesn't give a darn.
As long as the hit's a success.

1033
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:10,191
We are content with little.

1034
01:14:10,358 --> 01:14:15,525
- You're content with what?
- With a modest payoff.

1035
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:18,150
- A payoff?
- How much?

1036
01:14:18,316 --> 01:14:20,483
- It's a big hit.
- And a cool one.

1037
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:23,358
- Make your offer.
- For the idea.

1038
01:14:27,608 --> 01:14:30,191
16 and 17.

1039
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:33,775
They didn't even reach 20,000.

1040
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:36,483
How much is 17 divided by 4?

1041
01:14:38,483 --> 01:14:41,441
Someone got 1,000 Liras more!
Who was it?

1042
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:44,150
Me! My family has increased.

1043
01:14:44,316 --> 01:14:46,816
Agony lives with us.
He eats like a madman.

1044
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:50,441
He says he wants to marry Grandma.

1045
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:53,691
We'll pick you up with the van.
We're going to the beach.

1046
01:14:53,858 --> 01:14:55,816
Sign here.

1047
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,858
They were 6.
Now there are only 2 to follow.

1048
01:14:59,025 --> 01:15:01,900
It'll be easier for you
when you arrest them.

1049
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:06,400
- Thank you.
- Does he always eat like this?

1050
01:15:06,566 --> 01:15:09,900
- No, he has an upset stomach today.
- It's scary.

1051
01:15:10,066 --> 01:15:12,358
In your place, I'd see a doctor.

1052
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:15,316
- Maybe he has tapeworm.
- I had it.

1053
01:15:15,483 --> 01:15:18,566
But at the infirmary they said
I absorbed it.

1054
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:21,858
- You ate even that!
- Eat the flower in the glass!

1055
01:15:22,025 --> 01:15:26,900
- Who wants to play Tresette?
- I'll win the lunch money.

1056
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,233
- We'll get to 21. OK?
- Yes.

1057
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,150
- 21 is my game.
- Alright.

1058
01:15:33,316 --> 01:15:35,316
- Shall we make it 5,000?
- Alright.

1059
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:37,441
Do you mind if we play with mine?

1060
01:15:37,608 --> 01:15:41,525
- Alright.
- Give me 5,000. I want to laugh.

1061
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:45,233
- You want to cut the deck?
- No, to shuffle.

1062
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,650
- You don't trust me?
- One never knows.

1063
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:14,691
Raise.

1064
01:16:15,983 --> 01:16:18,900
"May I, madam?
Shall we play a game?"

1065
01:16:19,066 --> 01:16:23,150
"Mine is to 21. Let's make it
5,000 a hit. I want to laugh."

1066
01:16:23,316 --> 01:16:25,316
This idiot!

1067
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,233
Fuck off!

1068
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,900
That witch was a magician.

1069
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:33,400
"Madam, let's do a return game."

1070
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:35,733
I'd like to have seen you
in my place.

1071
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,525
Stop. I'll kill you.

1072
01:16:38,691 --> 01:16:40,150
Stop!

1073
01:16:41,483 --> 01:16:44,941
- Sunflower, do you feel ill?
- He killed himself with spaghetti.

1074
01:16:45,108 --> 01:16:49,691
No. I'm fine. I was thinking
of the cockroach, of Pigface.

1075
01:16:49,858 --> 01:16:52,108
Poor things.
They're criminals, but...

1076
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,691
What do you care?
They're doing the hit tomorrow.

1077
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:57,691
In fact. If they get caught...

1078
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:06,816
Stop! I can't go on.

1079
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:09,816
You lost 24,000 Liras!

1080
01:17:09,983 --> 01:17:13,108
- Be a sir!
- Did you mean that I'm stingy?

1081
01:17:13,275 --> 01:17:15,733
- Yes, you are!
- Repeat it!

1082
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,858
- Come on, Curly!
- You see these?

1083
01:17:18,025 --> 01:17:20,275
It's the money
for the van engine.

1084
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:24,025
- Stop!
- Are you crazy?

1085
01:17:24,191 --> 01:17:27,691
- I'll show you.
It's 40,000 Liras. I'll burn it.

1086
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:29,816
- Are you drunk?
- Come on!

1087
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,358
It's our money too.

1088
01:17:32,525 --> 01:17:35,233
Whoever gets close is a dead man.

1089
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:39,733
- You said I'm stingy!
- Idiot, what do you want to do?

1090
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,941
- Whoever gets close is a dead man!
- The money! He burned it!

1091
01:17:44,108 --> 01:17:46,108
You guys are good, huh?

1092
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:34,941
This boss is a big shot.

1093
01:18:35,108 --> 01:18:39,108
It could be a northern monarch.

1094
01:18:39,275 --> 01:18:41,858
So if it's possible to arrest him,

1095
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:45,066
I will personally carry that out.

1096
01:18:45,233 --> 01:18:48,316
This time,
dear Marshal Capriotti...

1097
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:55,066
- What date did they decide?
- Tomorrow.

1098
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:57,566
The custodian lives in the castle.

1099
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,150
What if he sees or hears
from upstairs?

1100
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:05,191
- What is his name?
- Ciarozzi Fernando, age 35, single.

1101
01:19:05,358 --> 01:19:10,566
- Northern faggot immigrant.
- Oh, he's gay!

1102
01:19:10,733 --> 01:19:13,066
Bring him here at 5.

1103
01:19:20,775 --> 01:19:22,608
Darn!

1104
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,858
A policeman who steals
isn't something you see every day.

1105
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:24,358
Let's take a nice picture.

1106
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:42,566
Go! Take off!

1107
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,900
Don't get too close
or they'll see us.

1108
01:22:12,066 --> 01:22:15,816
The boss could take
the helicopter. He'll arrive at 7.

1109
01:22:15,983 --> 01:22:17,900
He's an important person.

1110
01:22:47,025 --> 01:22:49,775
Here he is! Here's
the stolen stuff with the thieves.

1111
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:58,983
The bait is ready. Let's wait
for the big fish to bite.

1112
01:23:34,066 --> 01:23:36,816
Marshal, will we be here till dawn?

1113
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:40,066
Someone must have talked.

1114
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:42,983
Someone advised him.

1115
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,691
- Who?
- The boss.

1116
01:23:58,358 --> 01:24:00,233
It's useless to wait any longer.

1117
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,316
Let's recuperate the stuff and arrest
the delinquents. Give the signal!

1118
01:24:05,483 --> 01:24:07,191
- Full speed ahead!
- Yes.

1119
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:17,316
Here's the boss. Turn on the lights.
Precede all the cars. Go!

1120
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:34,525
Attention!
Ready to open fire!

1121
01:24:34,691 --> 01:24:37,275
They had accomplices
and bodyguards.

1122
01:24:37,441 --> 01:24:40,483
Get ready for the attack.

1123
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:45,941
It's two gangs who
are arguing over the stolen stuff.

1124
01:24:46,108 --> 01:24:47,483
Let's defend ourselves!

1125
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,191
Someone betrayed.

1126
01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:57,483
Hurry! Our tear gas bomb!

1127
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,150
Hurry, Visigato, jump down.
Pull!

1128
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:06,900
Let's leave.
We must save the loot!

1129
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:09,900
Right, yes.

1130
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:23,316
Drop your arms. Surrender!

1131
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:27,358
Cease fire!
Come forward with your hands up!

1132
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:32,358
We will never give up!
Criminals!

1133
01:25:32,525 --> 01:25:35,400
Fire, guys! Fire all you want!

1134
01:25:37,941 --> 01:25:41,025
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you, reverend.

1135
01:25:41,191 --> 01:25:44,191
Marshal Capriotti,
in this brilliant operation,

1136
01:25:44,358 --> 01:25:47,191
you found yourself face to face
with the delinquents.

1137
01:25:47,358 --> 01:25:49,775
Will you be able to
recognize anyone?

1138
01:25:50,608 --> 01:25:55,400
Fine! You must have seen
who shot you.

1139
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:59,066
- Damn...
- Please, enough. Go away.

1140
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:01,900
That bastard hit me
a couple of feet away.

1141
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:05,650
- Could you describe him?
- One of the usual southerners...

1142
01:26:05,816 --> 01:26:08,066
I don't want to seem biased,

1143
01:26:08,233 --> 01:26:11,900
but he was one of those black,
obtuse, sleazy southerners.

1144
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,983
A delinquent. I will catch him.

1145
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:17,441
- And the others?
- They were the usual four...

1146
01:26:18,816 --> 01:26:23,191
Four very dangerous,
very shrewd individuals,

1147
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:26,650
perhaps tied to American crime life.

1148
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:30,275
- Connected with the mafia.
- One last question.

1149
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:34,525
It is true the gang used arms
given to the Police Forces?

1150
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,691
No comment.

1151
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:11,316
Curly, did you read?

1152
01:27:11,483 --> 01:27:14,775
There was a shooting.
A miracle saved us.

1153
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:16,983
You must thank Asvero and me.

1154
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:21,691
Don't trust the fact that you float
because of a law of Nature.

1155
01:27:21,858 --> 01:27:24,316
The water is cold!

1156
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:30,275
But Pigface and the others...

1157
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:33,150
They didn't catch them.

1158
01:27:33,316 --> 01:27:36,275
Because I...

1159
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:38,066
The police!

1160
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:43,858
- Asvero, the Finance Guard!
- Let's go! Run!

1161
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,941
- Asvero, run!
- Here I am!

1162
01:27:52,983 --> 01:27:56,400
Why are they running? Stop!

1163
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,066
Go!

1164
01:28:11,941 --> 01:28:13,650
Be careful!

1165
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,441
- Don't be an idiot.
- I knew...

1166
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:26,025
Hurry. Let's get inside.

1167
01:28:26,191 --> 01:28:27,858
Close!

1168
01:28:28,025 --> 01:28:30,233
Hold on tight!

1169
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,275
Are we going backwards?

1170
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,941
Go!

1171
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,858
Why did we run away?

1172
01:28:44,025 --> 01:28:47,316
We were to act indifferent.
They weren't looking for us.

1173
01:28:47,483 --> 01:28:49,066
Yes, they were.

1174
01:28:49,233 --> 01:28:52,316
- This is a lovely car. What's this?
- Hold still.

1175
01:28:52,483 --> 01:28:54,941
It's cold!

1176
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:58,566
What cold air! I'm cold. Close it.

1177
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:03,775
- It's like a hurricane.
- Must be the "air unconditioning".

1178
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:07,525
- Close it.
- I can't. It's broken.

1179
01:29:14,441 --> 01:29:17,358
Yes, SCV license. Received.
Let's go, guys.

1180
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:35,150
Did you see?
That's how you open the trunk.

1181
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:37,775
Lallo, I'm scared.

1182
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:40,275
Let's leave it here
and walk back.

1183
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:44,025
We've been speeding
for an hour. It's 100 kilometers!

1184
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:45,775
There are cardinal clothes.

1185
01:29:45,941 --> 01:29:48,775
- Let's walk back.
- There're hats!

1186
01:29:48,941 --> 01:29:51,150
Do as I say. Leave it here.

1187
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:58,108
Will they notice us less
dressed like this?

1188
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:01,858
Sure!
If they see this costly car

1189
01:30:02,025 --> 01:30:05,525
with poor guys like us on it,
they'll stop us.

1190
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:09,233
But if there is a bishop,
a cardinal and a monsignor on it,

1191
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,233
it's normal.
- It's dangerous to act as cardinals.

1192
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,233
Sunflower, calm down.
We'll take a mountain road,

1193
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,900
leave the car
and run through the fields.

1194
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:37,441
Are you really afraid?

1195
01:30:37,608 --> 01:30:41,400
No, I am just tired.

1196
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:43,650
What do you want to do?

1197
01:30:43,816 --> 01:30:46,358
- What the others do.
- Load bricks?

1198
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,775
Yes. If we found a nice job...

1199
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,775
Curly, the police!

1200
01:30:55,816 --> 01:30:57,775
Marshal, that was the car.

1201
01:30:57,941 --> 01:31:02,316
Hello?
We went by the signaled car.

1202
01:31:02,483 --> 01:31:05,358
Call road block 7.
We're following it.

1203
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:08,066
Detach two motorcyclists
from the Aurelia,

1204
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:12,483
kilometer 146, at the intersection
with the underground passage. Over.

1205
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:18,066
- Where does this road lead to?
- San Crispino. I know it.

1206
01:31:18,233 --> 01:31:20,650
It comes out towards Rocca di Pietra.

1207
01:31:20,816 --> 01:31:24,108
Not even Jesus Christ
can stop us now.

1208
01:32:14,816 --> 01:32:18,191
- What is it?
- Darn! Honk!

1209
01:32:18,358 --> 01:32:20,941
They won't move.

1210
01:32:22,358 --> 01:32:24,775
- What happened?
- Who are you? Go!

1211
01:32:24,941 --> 01:32:26,691
- Go!
- How many are they?

1212
01:32:26,858 --> 01:32:29,733
- A procession.
- The bishop is here!

1213
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,900
- I am Jesus Christ.
- Curly, honk.

1214
01:32:32,066 --> 01:32:34,900
- We're stuck.
- They think we are real priests.

1215
01:32:35,066 --> 01:32:38,566
- I am the mother.
- Do something. Go forward slowly.

1216
01:32:38,733 --> 01:32:41,733
They came with a car from Rome.

1217
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,816
- They blocked us.
- Smile.

1218
01:32:48,608 --> 01:32:50,691
What'll we do? They won't move.

1219
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:53,608
- Let's play along.
- Darn it!

1220
01:32:53,775 --> 01:32:56,525
I knew it was dangerous
to act as cardinals.

1221
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:58,150
Silence!

1222
01:32:58,316 --> 01:33:01,191
Welcome, Eminence.
Give us your holy blessing.

1223
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:07,150
I bless you in the name of the Pope,
the Son and St. Peter and Paul.

1224
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:13,608
- Come on, Sunflower.
- Long live the bishop!

1225
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:24,691
Let us through. Excuse us.

1226
01:33:25,775 --> 01:33:29,650
- Long live the bishop!
- Don't bite!

1227
01:33:29,816 --> 01:33:32,816
Excuse us. Let us through.

1228
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:36,025
His Eminence is tired.
Asvero, remove this warrior.

1229
01:33:36,191 --> 01:33:38,358
Praise Mary!

1230
01:33:44,816 --> 01:33:46,733
Oh, God, the police!

1231
01:33:54,025 --> 01:33:55,900
What're you doing?

1232
01:33:57,608 --> 01:34:01,150
Make way! Make way!
Stop those delinquents!

1233
01:34:02,108 --> 01:34:04,691
Where are you going? Stop!

1234
01:34:08,858 --> 01:34:11,608
Make way, please!

1235
01:34:11,775 --> 01:34:15,900
Lallo! Help! Make way!

1236
01:34:16,066 --> 01:34:17,525
Move!

1237
01:34:19,983 --> 01:34:24,733
- Sacrilege!
- Let me go! I don't know anything!

1238
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,941
- They arrested the bishop!
- Lallo!

1239
01:34:29,983 --> 01:34:33,816
You think I'm a jerk because I carry
this cross? I'll massacre you!

1240
01:34:33,983 --> 01:34:36,566
Asvero! No, not on my head!

1241
01:34:36,733 --> 01:34:38,900
They're arresting the priests!

1242
01:34:39,066 --> 01:34:41,233
I am Republican. Long live Mazzini!

1243
01:34:45,733 --> 01:34:47,983
Who do you think
will be in command now?

1244
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:50,483
I don't know. They just hit me.
