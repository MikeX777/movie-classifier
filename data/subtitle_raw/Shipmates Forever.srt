1
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,133
HEY, MISS.

2
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,667
ER, UH, MISS.

3
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,701
I THINK YOU CAN SEE BETTER
FROM WAY UP HERE.

4
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,234
CAN Y'ALL HEAR ME?

5
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,267
WE CAN SEE ALL RIGHT
FROM A-WAY DOWN HERE.

6
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,601
HA HA HA!

7
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,334
HA HA! DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE IT.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,367
YOU BETTER
COME ON UP.

9
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,701
DON'T PAY ANY
ATTENTION TO HIM.

10
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,400
HE'S JUST PRETENDING
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ME.

11
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>OH, I REMEMBER YOU,
ALL RIGHT.</i>

12
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,934
HE DOES, HUH? BETTER COME ON UP, HUH?

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,667
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

14
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,200
COME ON, TED, UNBEND AND
HELP THE LITTLE LADY UP.

15
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,234
OOH!

16
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,234
CAREFUL, NOW.

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,234
WAIT, NOW!

18
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,601
OOP!

19
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,634
OH, THANKS.

20
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,868
AHH.
THERE YOU ARE.

21
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:21,167
YOU KNOW, TED'S HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ME

22
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,601
EVER SINCE THE DAY I SHOVED HIM

23
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:23,968
INTO THE SEVERN RIVER YEARS AGO.

24
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,400
SEVERN?
MM-HMM.

25
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,901
DID YOU LIVE
IN ANNAPOLIS?

26
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,167
WELL, I WAS THERE
WITH MY DAD.

27
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:29,968
WHEREVER HE WAS STATIONED,
I WAS STUCK THERE, TOO.

28
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,200
THEN YOU'RE NAVY.

29
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,133
NO, BUT MY DAD IS, AND
HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM,

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,868
HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM,
HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM...

31
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,100
I GET IT. NAVY,
RIGHT DOWN THE LINE.

32
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,868
AH, BUT THE LINE SANK
WHEN IT CAME TO ME.

33
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,868
NO NAVY FOR MINE.

34
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,968
WELL, AS, UH... AS LONG AS
TED DOESN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE

35
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,267
IN THE FORMALITIES
OF INTRODUCTION,

36
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,868
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

37
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,167
I BEGS TO REPORT,
MA'AM,

38
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:50,367
THAT MY NAME IS
RICHARD MELVILLE III...

39
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,400
OR THE SECOND
OR THE FOURTH.

40
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,400
HAVEN'T FIGURED
IT OUT YET.

41
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,934
ARE YOU ADMIRAL
MELVILLE'S SON?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,334
YOU GOT ME.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,634
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A MELVILLE.

44
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,934
HA HA HA!
WHY NOT?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
I DON'T KNOW.

46
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,400
I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE
I JUST COULDN'T PICTURE

47
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,868
A MELVILLE WITHOUT
A UNIFORM.

48
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,567
WHOA, THERE.
YOU SOUND LIKE MY DAD

49
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,467
WHEN HE OPENS UP HIS
FAMILY BROADSIDES ON ME.

50
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,534
I HEAR THAT SO OFTEN.

51
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,200
THERE'S HIS FLAGSHIP
OUT THERE NOW.

52
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:19,734
WANT TO TAKE A GANDER? A PEEP?

53
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:36,033
DO YOU GET A KICK OUT OF
THOSE CAST-IRON BATHTUBS?

54
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,367
ARE YOU A NAVY GIRL?

55
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,067
I WAS A NAVY GIRL.

56
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,133
MY FATHER WAS
CAPTAIN BLACKBURN.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,701
HE WENT DOWN WITH HIS SHIP IN THE WAR.

58
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,234
OH, I'M SORRY.

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,467
MY BROTHER JIM WAS A LIEUTENANT
- NAVAL AIR SERVICE.

60
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,234
YES.

61
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,033
NO WONDER YOU THINK I
SHOULD BE WEARING A UNIFORM.

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,934
NO, I DON'T.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,334
THE NAVY TOOK MY FATHER
AND MY BROTHER,

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,968
AND MOTHER DIED
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT

65
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,834
SHE SHOULD BE WITH DAD
ON THE CHINA STATION.

66
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,367
I'VE HAD ENOUGH NAVY
IN MY FAMILY.

67
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,934
WELL, HERE WE ARE
- TWO AGAINST THE NAVY.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,868
MAYBE JUNE'S GOT SOME
REASON FOR WHAT SHE SAYS,

69
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,234
<i>BUT WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU
GOT TO POOH-POOH THE NAVY?</i>

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,334
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
A SUCKER FOR A UNIFORM

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,667
JUST BECAUSE
YOUR DAD WEARS ONE.

72
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,467
I'M NOT GOING TO TRADE
MY CHANCE TO WEAR ONE

73
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,367
FOR THE PRIVILEGE
OF BEING A CROONER.

74
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,934
NOW, NOW, NOW.
HEH HEH HEH!

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
YOU KNOW I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT.

76
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,334
I LIKE YOUR MUSIC.

77
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,267
DON'T MIND TED.

78
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,200
YOU TWO FIGHT LIKE BROTHER AND
SISTER, OR LIKE YOU WERE MARRIED.

79
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:43,734
TED'S MY COUSIN. HIS
FATHER SORT OF ADOPTED ME.

80
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,567
OH. WELL, AT LEAST I'M
GLAD YOU'RE NOT MARRIED...

81
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:47,767
TO HIM.

82
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,901
WE DON'T MARRY FIRST
COUSINS WHERE I COME FROM.

83
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,634
BESIDES,
TED'S GOING NAVY-

84
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:55,400
GOING TO TRY FOR THE ACADEMY THIS YEAR.

85
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,501
I'D NEVER MARRY
A NAVY MAN.

86
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,501
THAT'S THE BEST NEWS
I'VE HEARD TODAY.

87
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,968
DOES THAT MAKE ME
ELIGIBLE?

88
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,734
DO YOU WANT TO BE?

89
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,067
YOU AND TED COME DOWN
TO THE SKY CLUB TONIGHT,

90
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,234
AND I'LL SWEAR OUT
AN AFFIDAVIT.

91
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,100
IF YOU THINK I'D PAY
A $5.00 COVER CHARGE

92
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,667
TO HEAR YOU SING,
YOU'RE CRAZY.

93
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:17,067
JUST PUT A LITTLE COTTON
IN YOUR EARS, TED.

94
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,934
BRING LITTLE JUNE ALONG, AND I'LL
TREAT YOU TO THE COVER CHARGE.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
I'LL TREAT YOU
TO A...

96
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,601
OH, GO TAKE A HOP,
SKIP, AND A JUMP.

97
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,100
YOU KNOW, IF FAMILY
INFLUENCE MEANS ANYTHING,

98
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,634
YOU'RE GOING TO
LIKE ME A LOT.

99
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,834
I THINK I'LL TAKE
ANOTHER GANDER.

100
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,133
MY NAME IS RICHARD MELVILLE.
THE ADMIRAL EXPECTS ME.

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,901
OH, YES.
THE ADMIRAL IS ON DECK.

102
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:16,100
WELL...
HELLO, SON.

103
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,901
HELLO, DAD. NICE FLEET
YOU BROUGHT HOME WITH YOU.

104
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,100
YOU EVIDENTLY GOT MY TELEGRAM,
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

105
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,367
UH-HUH. WELL, HAVE
YOU COME TO A DECISION?

106
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,701
YOU EXPECT ME
TO CHANGE MY MIND?

107
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,267
I SINCERELY HOPE SO.

108
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,767
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY REASON TO CHANGE IT.

109
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,767
COME HERE, SON.

110
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:34,167
DICK, DOESN'T THE SIGHT OF THE
FLEET TODAY BRING ANY RESPONSE,

111
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:36,968
ANY DESIRE TO SERVE
IN IT?

112
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,634
NOPE, DAD. GUESS I'VE
SEEN TOO MANY NEWSREELS.

113
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,868
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOUND
OF THOSE ANCHOR CHAINS

114
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,767
RATTLING DOWN A FEW
MINUTES AGO MEANT TO ME?

115
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,567
IT MEANS THE END
OF MY LAST SEA DUTY.

116
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,767
TOMORROW MORNING, I'M TO
BE RELIEVED OF COMMAND.

117
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,000
YOU STILL HAVE 4 MORE
YEARS BEFORE YOU'RE RETIRED.

118
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,033
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUPERINTENDENT
OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY.

119
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,267
YES.

120
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,067
SEEMS LIKE A GREAT HONOR-
GOING BACK TO THE ACADEMY

121
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,434
AND BEING HEAD OF THE SAME SCHOOL
THAT YOU ENTERED AS A PLEBE.

122
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,167
IT'S GOING TO BE
A VERY EMPTY HONOR

123
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,467
UNLESS YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

124
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,501
IT WOULD BE A GREAT
HONOR... IF I COULD KNOW

125
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,400
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO WALK THROUGH
THOSE GATES TO BECOME A MIDSHIPMAN

126
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,400
THE SAME AS I DID AND
MY FATHER BEFORE ME...

127
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,767
THAT YOU'D BE
THE NEXT MELVILLE

128
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,734
TO WRITE A NEW CHAPTER
IN NAVAL RECORDS.

129
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,467
OH, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S JUST
WHY I DON'T WANT IT, DAD.

130
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,501
I DON'T WANT TO BE
JUST ANOTHER MELVILLE.

131
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:20,100
IF I WOUND UP ANYTHING SHORT OF BEING
AN ADMIRAL, I'D BE A BLACK SHEEP.

132
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,400
YOU KNOW, SON, I THINK I
COULD UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER

133
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,801
IF YOU'D CHOSEN TO BE, SAY,
AN ENGINEER OR A DOCTOR...

134
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,133
SOMETHING TO SUSTAIN
THE IDEA OF SERVICE.

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
OH, WELL, I...
I'M SERVICING.

136
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:33,067
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
PEOPLE GOT TO BE ENTERTAINED.

137
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,300
YOU KNOW THAT I ALREADY MAKE 3
TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU DO A YEAR?

138
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,334
THAT'S NOT BAD
FOR A YOUNGSTER.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
TOOK YOU 40 YEARS TO GET TO
THE TOP OF YOUR PROFESSION, DAD.

140
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,267
IT'S ONLY TAKEN ME
TWO YEARS.

141
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:47,834
MY FOREBEARS HAVE ALWAYS
SERVED COUNTRY AND FLAG...

142
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:48,834
NOT DOLLARS.

143
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,734
OH, DAD. YOU'RE
A SENTIMENTALIST.

144
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,234
TODAY, EVERYTHING BOILS
DOWN TO DOLLARS AND CENTS,

145
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,934
NOT THE STAR-SPANGLED
BANNER.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,968
I SEE.

147
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,801
OH, I DON'T MEAN THAT
REALLY, THOUGH.

148
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,868
I MEAN THAT I'VE JUST HEARD
"NAVY, NAVY, NAVY, NAVY"

149
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,501
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT.

150
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,367
I WANT TO STAND
ON MY OWN.

151
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:09,234
I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT
KIND OF A JOB.

152
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,601
THERE IS SOMETHING I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO, SON,

153
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,801
IF IT ISN'T
TOO MUCH NAVY.

154
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,200
I'D LIKE YOU TO BE
ABOARD TOMORROW MORNING

155
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,234
WHEN I SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MY LAST SEA DUTY...

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,200
WHEN I TURN OVER
MY LAST COMMAND.

157
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,267
SURE, DAD. I'VE GOT A COUPLE
FRIENDS WHO'D LIKE TO SEE THE SHOW.

158
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,534
CAN I BRING THEM
ON BOARD?

159
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,334
WELL, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
GOING TO BE A SHOW, DICK.

160
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I'D, UH, PREFER
THAT YOU CAME ALONE.

161
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,300
OK, DAD.
WHAT TIME WILL IT BE?

162
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,334
4 BELLS.

163
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,634
4 BELLS?
4 BELLS IN THE NAVY...

164
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,901
THAT'S, UH, 10:00 IN
THE MORNING TO ME, HUH?

165
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:34,901
YES, YES.

166
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:35,901
OK, DAD.

167
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,367
I'LL BE HERE.
GOOD-BYE.

168
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,767
Melville, on radio: GOOD EVENING,
EVERYBODY. THIS IS DICK MELVILLE SPEAKING.

169
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,100
TONIGHT IS "WELCOME NAVY NIGHT"
HERE AT THE SKY CLUB.

170
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,334
I'VE WRITTEN A NEW SONG THAT
I WANT TO DEDICATE TO THE NAVY

171
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,567
AND TO ADMIRAL RICHARD MELVILLE,
THE BOSS OF THE FLEET-

172
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:57,901
<i>DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP.</i>

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,334
* SHIPMATES, STAND TOGETHER

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,334
* DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP

175
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,467
* FAIR OR STORMY WEATHER

176
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:22,901
* WE WON'T GIVE UP,
WE WON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP *

177
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:26,901
* FRIENDS AND PALS FOREVER

178
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:31,067
* IT'S A LONG, LONG TRIP

179
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,200
* IF YOU HAVE TO
TAKE A LICKIN' *

180
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,667
* CARRY ON AND QUIT
YOUR KICKIN' *

181
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,868
* DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP

182
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,667
TABLE FOR TWO, PLEASE.

183
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,601
SORRY, SIR. EVERY TABLE IS
TAKEN. HAVE YOU RESERVATIONS?

184
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,667
NO, WE HAVEN'T, AND I'M
GLAD EVERY TABLE IS TAKEN,

185
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,501
AND I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY
PLEASANT EVENING. COME ON, JUNE.

186
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,067
BUT MR. MELVILLE
WAS EXPECTING US.

187
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,634
OH, ARE YOU MISS BLACKBURN AND ESCORT?

188
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,701
YES.

189
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,400
ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES.
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

190
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,701
* SHIPMATES, STAND TOGETHER

191
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,501
* DON'T GIVE UP...

192
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,400
"MISS BLACKBURN AND EXCESS
BAGGAGE," HE SHOULD HAVE SAID.

193
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,667
<i>WHY DIDN'T DICK LEAVE
THE TABLE IN MY NAME?</i>

194
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,901
MAYBE HE LIKES ME
BETTER THAN YOU.

195
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,767
WELL, I HOPE SO.

196
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:22,701
* FRIENDS AND PALS FOREVER

197
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,334
* IT'S A LONG, LONG TRIP

198
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,100
* IF YOU HAVE TO
TAKE A LICKIN' *

199
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,601
* CARRY ON
AND QUIT YOUR KICKIN' *

200
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,367
* DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP

201
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:40,634
HE OUGHT TO BE MARCHING
BEHIND THAT DITTY

202
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,534
INSTEAD OF YELPING IT
OVER A MICROPHONE.

203
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,834
SHH!

204
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,167
GOOD EVENING,
MISS BLACKBURN.

205
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,167
AND A SOUR EVENING TO YOU, MR. STERLING.

206
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,634
<i>AFTER HEARING YOU SING,
IT REALLY IS SOUR.</i>

207
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:53,601
MAY I?

208
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,400
NOT IF YOU'RE
A MIND READER.

209
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,234
DEPENDS ON WHOSE
MIND HE'S READING.

210
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,834
THANK YOU. NO SOONER SAID THAN SAT.

211
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:01,567
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO SING
ANOTHER SONG FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

212
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:03,300
I WISH IT WERE
10 YEARS.

213
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,133
OH, YOU'RE A PIKER.
WHAT'S 10 YEARS?

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,667
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE
ASTRONOMICAL TERM "LIGHT YEARS"?

215
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,267
MILLIONS OF YEARS,
BILLIONS OF YEARS?

216
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,734
WHY, DO YOU KNOW
THAT-

217
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,801
WHY, DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT THE
LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN ASTRONOMY?

218
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:14,834
ARE YOU?

219
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,133
OH, INTENSELY.

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,501
THEN I SHALL TAKE THIS RARE
OPPORTUNITY AND SHOW YOU

221
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,267
AN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA WHICH
YOU REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS.

222
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,901
WILL YOU EXCUSE US, PLEASE? NO.

223
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:26,200
OH, THAT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU, TED. THANKS.

224
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,234
AND NOW FOR THAT RARE
ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA

225
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
WHICH YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO MISS...

226
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,033
OR MYSELF, EITHER,
FOR THAT MATTER.

227
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
LET'S, UH...
LET ME SEE.

228
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,868
LET'S CONSIDER THE STAR "R," PLANET "Q."

229
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:49,167
IT, UH-I THINK YOU CAN
SEE BETTER FROM OVER HERE.

230
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,801
WE CAN SPECIFY
ITS POSITION

231
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:56,300
BY GIVING ITS ZENITH DISTANCE, ZQ...

232
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:02,033
AND THE AZIMUTH FROM THE SOUTH POINT
- THAT'S ANGLE QZS.

233
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,667
OR BY GIVING THE NORTH
POLE A DISTANCE-PQ-

234
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,734
AND THE ANGLE QPZ,

235
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:13,300
WHICH, OF COURSE YOU KNOW,
IS CALLED THE "R" ANGLE.

236
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,400
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ASTRONOMY THAN I DO.

237
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,100
MAYBE.

238
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,000
THEN WHY DID YOU COME OUT HERE WITH ME?

239
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,167
BECAUSE YOU
WANTED ME TO.

240
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,167
I WISH I KNEW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE LAWS OF GRAVITY.

241
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,701
WHY?

242
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,334
THEN I'D KNOW WHY
I'VE FALLEN FOR YOU

243
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,501
FASTER THAN
A TON OF BRICKS.

244
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,734
CAN I SEE YOU
TOMORROW...

245
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,234
AND EVERY TOMORROW
FROM THEN ON?

246
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,100
YOU'D HAVE TO FALL ALL THE
WAY TO ANNAPOLIS TO DO THAT.

247
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,367
OH, WHY MUST YOU GO
BACK TO ANNAPOLIS?

248
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,434
I LIVE THERE
AND I WORK THERE,

249
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,567
TEACHING 8-YEAR-OLD
NAVY JUNIORS

250
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,968
HOW TO PUT THEIR HEELS
IN FRONT OF THEIR TOES.

251
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:57,434
AH, NEW YORK CAN'T KEEP ME
HERE, WITH YOU DOWN IN CRAB TOWN.

252
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:00,467
YOU MEANT WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT NOT MARRYING NAVY?

253
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,200
UH-HUH.

254
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:05,467
THEN, BY THE GRACE OF THE
STARS AND LAWS OF GRAVITY,

255
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,634
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU
WANT TO MARRY ME.

256
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,467
<i>I WISH I KNEW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE LAWS OF GRAVITY.</i>

257
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,000
WHY?

258
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,534
THEN I'D KNOW WHY I'VE
FALLEN FOR YOU FASTER...

259
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,300
OH, MY.
GOOD OLD ZENITH.

260
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,400
HA HA! OH, POOR OLD TED'S
ALONE. COME ON.

261
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,767
ALL RIGHT.

262
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,033
SORRY, TED.

263
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,534
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A DREAM
PORTRAIT OF YOU, MR. MELVILLE.

264
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,267
Melville: WELL... IT
HARDLY DOES ME JUSTICE.

265
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,701
Ted: OH, I THINK SO.

266
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,400
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE,
YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE

267
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,801
TO DRAW FOR
THE FUNNY PAPERS.

268
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,567
I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK,
DARLING. SEE YOU LATER.

269
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,834
THAT'S VERY PRETTY,
TED. WHAT IS IT?

270
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,734
WHY, IT'S A...

271
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,901
* WHEN SOMEONE TELLS
ME TO MARCH *

272
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,801
* OR TO HALT

273
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,100
* MY SOUL REBELS

274
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,467
* I'M THAT WAY
TO A FAULT *

275
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:18,234
* NO RULES OR REGULATIONS

276
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
* WOULD I OBEY

277
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:26,033
* THEN I MET YOU,
AND I KNEW RIGHT AWAY *

278
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,300
* IF YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN

279
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,367
* I'LL BE THE CREW

280
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:37,834
* 'CAUSE I'D JUST LOVE
TO TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

281
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,000
* YOU BLOW THE BUGLE

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,067
* AND I'LL JUMP THROUGH

283
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,667
* OH, HOW I'D LOVE TO

284
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,734
* TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU

285
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,367
* I KNOW THAT RULES
WERE MEANT FOR FOOLS *

286
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,667
* THAT'S ONE THING
I HAVE LEARNED *

287
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:58,033
* BUT I'M GOING IN
FOR DISCIPLINE *

288
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,634
* WHEREVER YOU'RE CONCERNED

289
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,834
* IF YOU SAY, "KISS ME,"

290
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,834
* THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO

291
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,868
* 'CAUSE I'D JUST LOVE TO

292
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:13,234
* TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU

293
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,267
CONVERSE!

294
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:25,300
YES, SIR.

295
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,868
WHAT TIME IS IT?
10 OF 10:00, SIR.

296
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,767
10 OF 10:00. I'VE ONLY GOT 10
MINUTES TO GET TO THE FLAGSHIP.

297
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,067
GET MY CLOTHES DOWN TO THE CAR. CALL
THE DRIVER. TELL HIM TO HURRY UP.

298
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,400
WHAT CLOTHES, SIR?

299
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,100
ANYTHING! ANYTHING! I HAVEN'T
GOT TIME TO DRESS HERE.

300
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,100
VERY GOOD, SIR.

301
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,767
TELL HIM TO MEET US
DOWN IN FRONT.

302
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,667
COME ON! COME ON!

303
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,000
OK, ORIN!

304
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:47,634
MY DAD WILL NEVER
GET OVER THIS.

305
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:50,868
WHEW! WHY DIDN'T I
GET TO BED EARLIER?

306
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,067
STEP ON IT,
WILL YOU, ORIN?!

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,801
AM I TOO LATE
FOR THE CEREMONY?

308
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,367
NO. THE ADMIRAL
IS STILL BELOW.

309
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:05,901
THANK YOU, SIR.

310
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,701
HELLO, DAD.
I'M LATE.

311
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,601
SO I SEE.

312
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,100
HELLO, DICK.

313
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,968
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

314
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:28,133
TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN
OF THE UNITED STATES FLEET,

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,267
AND TO THE PERSONNEL OF
THIS SHIP IN PARTICULAR,

316
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:35,167
IT IS WITH GREAT REGRET
THAT I TURN OVER MY COMMAND.

317
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:38,400
BEFORE DOING SO, I WANT
TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION

318
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:43,067
FOR THE COOPERATION AND LOYALTY
THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM ALL HANDS

319
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,734
DURING THE LONG PERIOD
OF MY COMMAND.

320
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,634
AND IT IS A MATTER OF
GENUINE SATISFACTION TO ME

321
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:52,634
THAT MY SUCCESSOR,
YOUR FUTURE COMMANDER IN CHIEF,

322
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,834
IS MY LIFELONG FRIEND
AND CLASSMATE,

323
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:57,067
ADMIRAL GRAVES.

324
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,367
AND MY PARTING WORD

325
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:06,167
TO ALL HANDS IS, "KEEP
THIS FLEET FIT TO FIGHT."

326
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,534
I WILL NOW READ
MY ORDERS.

327
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,267
"NAVY DEPARTMENT,

00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,901
SIGNED,
SECRETARY OF THE NAVY."

338
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:41,067
CAPTAIN, HAUL DOWN
MY FLAG, SIR.

339
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,901
AYE, AYE.

340
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,601
OH, HELLO, SON.

341
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,434
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME A MINUTE
WHILE I GET INTO CIVILIAN CLOTHES.

342
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,968
I'M FLYING TO WASHINGTON.

343
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,834
OK, DAD.

344
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,400
THANK YOU, DICK.
YOU'LL BE STANDING

345
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,467
IN YOUR FATHER'S SHOES UP THERE SOMEDAY.

346
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,734
AND AFTER 40 YEARS
OF SERVICE,

347
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,434
ALL I'D HAVE TO SHOW
FOR IT IS ONE OF THESE?

348
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,667
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.

349
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,100
NO, FRED. DICK'S NOT GOING
TO TRY FOR THE ACADEMY.

350
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,934
HE'S EVIDENTLY FOUND OUT
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,501
MORE TO IT THAN JUST GOING DOWN
THERE AND KNOCKING AT THE GATE.

352
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,234
IT'S STILL A PRETTY
TOUGH PLACE TO GET INTO.

353
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,133
HE REALIZES THAT BEING A MELVILLE
DOESN'T MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

354
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,501
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
A CASE OF COLD FEET.

355
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:42,434
HE KNOWS HE COULDN'T EVEN
PASS THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION.

356
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:52,267
WHY, DICK, I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WOULD SHY AT THOSE EXAMINATIONS.

357
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,367
ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD
YOU WERE PRETTY SAVVY

358
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:57,067
IN YOUR STUDIES
AT COLLEGE.

359
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,834
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

360
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,868
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM, DAD? A NINCOMPOOP?

361
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,534
HA HA! WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, SON?

362
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,501
TELLING ADMIRAL GRAVES I HAD COLD FEET
AND COULDN'T PASS THOSE EXAMINATIONS.

363
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,133
WELL, THAT'S
THE TRUTH, ISN'T IT?

364
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,234
OH, I SEE.

365
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,767
YOU THINK ALL THOSE
MIDSHIPMEN DOWN THERE

366
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,300
ARE SMARTER THAN
YOUR OWN SON.

367
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,267
SINCE YOU WANT TO PUT IT
THAT WAY...

368
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,033
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I THINK.

369
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,601
I'VE GIVEN THIS THING A
LOT OF CONSIDERATION, DICK,

370
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,834
AND MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT IN
THIS SINGING CAREER OF YOURS,

371
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,000
SINCE YOU COULDN'T BEAR
THE DISGRACE OF FAILING

372
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,701
IN THE ENTRANCE
EXAMINATION.

373
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,200
DISGRACE? FAILURE?

374
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:35,033
I COULD PASS THOSE
EXAMINATIONS WITH MY EYES SHUT.

375
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,067
YOU THINK SO?

376
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,067
I KNOW SO.

377
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,267
HA HA HA!
I DOUBT THAT.

378
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:42,033
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT
YOUR SON IS NO NITWIT.

379
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,601
I'LL PROVE TO YOU
THAT I'M SMART ENOUGH

380
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,567
TO GET INTO THE NAVY
IF I WANT TO.

381
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:50,501
I'LL PASS THOSE EXAMINATIONS, BUT I
DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THE APPOINTMENT.

382
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,501
WELL, FRED...

383
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,501
A WORLD OF LUCK
TO YOU.

384
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,701
THANK YOU, DICK.

385
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,734
GOOD-BYE.

386
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,868
TIME'S UP, BOYS.
TURN YOUR PAPERS IN.

387
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,334
PRINCIPALS AND ALTERNATES WILL RECEIVE
WORD OF APPOINTMENT OR FAILURE BY MAIL

388
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,834
FROM THE NAVY
DEPARTMENT.

389
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,100
GOOD LUCK.

390
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,300
TRY THIS ON YOUR
RADIO, SPARKS.

391
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,968
I'VE PASSED!

392
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Sparks: HA HA!

393
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,767
HEY, SPARKS!
YOU GOT CHINA!

394
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,834
YOU CAN KEEP CHINA!
YOU CAN KEEP THE RADIO!

395
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,834
I'M GOING TO
THE NAVAL ACADEMY! HEY!

396
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:24,200
HEY! LOOK HERE, Y'ALL!
I GOT IT! HEY, LOOK!

397
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:25,434
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

398
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,968
MY APPOINTMENT! I'M
GOING TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY

399
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,968
TO LEARN HOW TO GIVE
YOU MUGS ORDERS!

400
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,300
<i>HEY,
WE'LL TAKE ORDERS!</i>

401
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:32,334
All: YEAH!

402
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,634
ALL I COULD READ WAS
"NAVY DEPARTMENT."

403
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,167
WHAT DOES IT SAY, SON?

404
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,567
IT JUST SAYS
I PASSED, MA.

405
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,634
HA HA. I PASSED!

406
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,334
DICK, HERE'S THAT LETTER
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

407
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,367
FROM THE NAVY
DEPARTMENT.

408
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,868
YOUR CHAUFFEUR
JUST BROUGHT IT OVER.

409
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:54,167
THANKS, HARRY.

410
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:56,767
WELL, I PASSED-

411
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,667
PASSED MY EXAMINATIONS
FOR THE NAVAL ACADEMY.

412
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,601
HA HA HA! WHAT A JOKE THIS
IS GOING TO BE ON YOUR FATHER

413
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,033
WHEN HE FINDS OUT YOU'RE
GOING TO TURN IT DOWN.

414
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,367
OH, BUT THE JOKE'S
ON ME, HARRY.

415
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,267
I CAN'T TURN THE OLD
ADMIRAL DOWN.

416
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,534
YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE GOING TO...

417
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,167
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

418
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,701
Melville, on radio:
GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.

419
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,801
THIS IS DICK MELVILLE SPEAKING
TO YOU FROM THE SKY CLUB

420
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,067
IN GOOD OLD NEW YORK CITY.

421
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:23,434
TOM, TURN OFF
THAT RADIO.

422
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,167
TOM!

423
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,701
Melville: THIS IS
GOOD-BYE TO RADIO, FOR ME,

424
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,601
BECAUSE I'VE PASSED MY ENTRANCE
EXAMINATION TO ANNAPOLIS,

425
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,534
AND I'M GOING NAVY!

426
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:46,767
Tom: DID YOU CALL,
ADMIRAL, SIR?

427
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,033
YES! YES, TOM, YOU POUR ME
A GLASS OF THAT OLDEST PORT.

428
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,000
Melville:
*... THE SHIP

429
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,200
* FAIR OR STORMY WEATHER

430
00:22:56,267 --> 00:23:00,801
* WE WON'T GIVE UP,
WE WON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP *

431
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:05,133
* FRIENDS AND PALS FOREVER

432
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,701
* IT'S A LONG, LONG TRIP

433
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,701
* IF YOU HAVE
TO TAKE A LICKIN' *

434
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:13,033
* CARRY ON AND
QUIT YOUR KICKIN' *

435
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,100
* DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP

436
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:53,767
NO SMOKING, SIR.

437
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,334
OH, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT.

438
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:58,267
THANK YOU.

439
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,701
WHOA, YOU DUDE!

440
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,667
ARE YOU ENTERING HERE?

441
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,801
WELL, WHAT DOES
IT LOOK LIKE?

442
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,367
FROM WHAT I HEAR TELL OF
THE ACADEMY, MY FRIEND,

443
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,501
YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE
TO REGRET THAT ENTRANCE.

444
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,234
DID YOU PAY THOSE GUYS TO DO THAT?

445
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,934
YOU BOYS KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
NO, SIR.
NO, SIR.

447
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,701
ALL RIGHT, FOLLOW ME. I'LL SHOW YOU.

448
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:07,601
SAY, "AH."

449
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:17,567
AHHH.

450
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,667
HEE HEE.

451
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:22,968
WHOA!

452
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:27,100
MERCY, DOC!

453
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,033
Doctor:
TURN YOUR HEAD.

454
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,200
NOW COUGH.

455
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,167
THE OTHER SIDE.

456
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,601
COUGH AGAIN.

457
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,400
WHOA!

458
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,501
DID YOU EVER THINK OF
TOTING THEM UP ONE AT A TIME?

459
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,501
CAN YOU DO THAT?

460
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:55,934
SURE. WHY NOT?
I'M DOING IT.

461
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,801
NOTHING IN THE REGULATIONS AGAINST IT.

462
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:58,901
THAT'S FUNNY.

463
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:01,033
IT THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME OR SOMETHING...

464
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,601
TESTING
THE MANHOOD IN YOU.

465
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,367
OH, NO.
THAT COMES LATER.

466
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,234
WELL, ROOMMATES,

467
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,067
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T CATCH
IT, THE NAME'S BROWN.

468
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,501
THEY CHRISTENED ME
LAFAYETTE,

469
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,801
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT'S WHAT PERSHING
SAID THE MORNING I ARRIVED.

470
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,434
YOU KNOW, "LAFAYETTE,
HERE WE ARE."

471
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,033
ONLY IT WAS ME, SPARKS, IN
ARKANSAS, AND PERSHING WAS IN FRANCE.

472
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,501
I CAME IN FROM
THE FLEET, FELLAS-

473
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,133
<i>JOHNNY LAWRENCE,
FROM THE TEXAS.</i>

474
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,501
UH, THEY CALL ME
COXSWAIN.

475
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:36,701
MY NAME'S LINCOLN-
ARIZONA.

476
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,634
CALL ME COWBOY.

477
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:39,968
DICK MELVILLE,
NEW YORK.

478
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,501
Sparks: BOY, YOU DON'T
NEED TO TELL US WHO YOU ARE.

479
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,200
WE GOT A LOAD OF YOU
WHEN YOU WALKED IN.

480
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,367
Cowboy: I'LL SAY.

481
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,000
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
FELLAS?

482
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:49,067
HAVE YOU GOT
A LITTLE ICE WATER?

483
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,133
I- HA HA HA.

484
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,534
YOUR PLEBE SUMMER WILL
BE A BREEZE, MISTERS,

485
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,467
COMPARED TO WHAT YOU'LL GET WHEN THE
FIRST CLASS COMES BACK FROM THE CRUISE.

486
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,267
WE CAN TAKE IT,
SIR.

487
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,767
WE'LL SEE.

488
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:02,868
IN THE MEANTIME,
BEAR A HAND.

489
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,767
GET YOUR MARKING DONE,
YOUR LOCKERS STOWED.

490
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,367
WHEN ASSEMBLY SOUNDS, FALL
IN BELOW TO BE SWORN IN.

491
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,567
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
AND DON'T FORGET...

492
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:13,434
THE FIRST CLASS CRUISE
GETS BACK IN SEPTEMBER.

493
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,501
AND THAT GOES FOR YOU,
MR. MELVILLE.

494
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,200
HE JUST SAID THAT
TO SCARE YOU.

495
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,834
WHAT DOES HE MEAN,
"GET YOUR MARKING DONE"?

496
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,968
GET OUT YOUR INDELIBLE INK AND
YOU MARK AN OUTFIT. I'LL SHOW YOU.

497
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:30,467
ASSEMBLY! LET'S GO!

498
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,634
Melville:
LIKE WE ARE?

499
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:32,834
BOYS, WHEN THAT
BUGLE BLOWS,

500
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,300
YOU GO
HOWEVER YOU ARE!

501
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:40,167
Man: RAISE YOUR RIGHT HANDS,
GENTLEMEN, AND REPEAT AFTER ME.

502
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:43,901
I, HAVING BEEN APPOINTED A MIDSHIPMAN
IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY...

503
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:47,868
All: I, HAVING BEEN APPOINTED A
MIDSHIPMAN IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY...

504
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:50,701
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR...

505
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:54,167
THAT I WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES...

506
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:57,701
THAT I WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES...

507
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:03,200
AGAINST ALL ENEMIES,
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC...

508
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,701
AND I WILL BEAR TRUE FAITH
AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE SAME.

509
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,767
AND I WILL BEAR TRUE FAITH
AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE SAME.

510
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,868
AND I TAKE THIS OBLIGATION FREELY...

511
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:13,167
AND I TAKE THIS OBLIGATION FREELY...

512
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:16,033
WITHOUT ANY METTLE RESERVATION
OR PURPOSE OF EVASION...

513
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,501
WITHOUT ANY METTLE RESERVATION
OR PURPOSE OF EVASION...

514
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,567
THAT I WILL WELL AND
FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE DUTIES

515
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,734
OF THE OFFICE ON WHICH
I AM ABOUT TO ENTER...

516
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,534
THAT I WILL WELL AND
FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE DUTIES

517
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:28,634
OF THE OFFICE UPON WHICH
I AM ABOUT TO ENTER...

518
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,434
SO HELP ME, GOD.

519
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,968
HANDS DOWN, GENTLEMEN.

520
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:36,467
YOU'RE NOW MIDSHIPMEN IN THE
UNITED STATES NAVY. CONGRATULATIONS.

521
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:37,968
FOR THE BENEFIT
OF MY ROOMMATES,

522
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:40,667
I WILL NOW READ FROM THE REGULATIONS
OF THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY'S

523
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,067
<i>THE STOWAGE OF LOCKERS.</i>

524
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,234
DO YOU FOLLOW ME?

525
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,234
ONE FOR EACH OCCUPANT.

526
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,734
"4 INCHES FROM WALL

534
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,234
SEWING KIT?

535
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,734
YOU MEAN, WE HAVE TO DO OUR
OWN SEWING IN THIS PLACE?

536
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,701
Coxswain: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE YOU DO WITH A SEWING KIT

537
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:08,834
BESIDES SEW WITH IT.

538
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,667
I'LL DO ALL YOUR DARNING
FOR A DIME A SOCK.

539
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:13,467
I WAS THE BEST LITTLE
DARNER ON MY BATTLESHIP.

540
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:14,901
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY EXPECT US

541
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,167
TO GET ALL THIS JUNK
IN HERE, ANYWAY.

542
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,934
JUST LISTEN
TO PAPA, CROONER.

543
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,300
HE'S READING YOU
HOW TO DO IT.

544
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,634
HEY, YOU-YOU. DON'T CALL
ME CROONER. GET ME?

545
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:26,000
OK. OK. OK.

546
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,133
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH YOUR LOCKER, DICK?

547
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,701
MINE IS ALMOST DONE.

548
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,868
NO, THANKS, COXSWAIN.
I CAN STOW MY OWN.

549
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,701
Cowboy: I COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP, COXSWAIN.

550
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,067
ALL RIGHT.

551
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:41,033
SAY! ARE YOU REALLY THAT
SINGING FELLA FROM NEW YORK CITY?

552
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,901
I THOUGHT SO.

553
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,567
I NEVER CARED MUCH
FOR YOUR SINGING MYSELF,

554
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:53,200
BUT I ALWAYS SAYS, "EVERY
FELLA TO HIS OWN OPINION."

555
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,701
I'M NOT ASKING ANYBODY
FOR ANY OPINIONS.

556
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,868
I CAME HERE AS A MIDSHIPMAN,
NOT AS A CROONER.

557
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,801
THE SOONER YOU FORGET YOU EVER HEARD ME
ON THE RADIO, THE BETTER I'LL LIKE IT.

558
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:03,734
YOU OUGHT TO TELL THAT
TO THOSE UPPERCLASSMEN.

559
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,701
THEY SEEN YOU
WHEN YOU DONE IT,

560
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,767
IF I MIGHT LAPSE INTO
THE COLLOQUIAL.

561
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,033
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA
TAKE YOU A LONG TIME

562
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,167
TO LIVE DOWN THAT
ENTRANCE OF YOURS.

563
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,968
WASN'T A RADIO ISSUED
TO ANY OF YOU GUYS?

564
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,100
I DIDN'T SEE ANY
RADIO ON MY LIST.

565
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,734
I DON'T THINK PLEBES
RATE RADIOS.

566
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:24,367
I WAS RAISED ON A RADIO.
GOT TO HAVE A RADIO.

567
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,367
HOW'S ABOUT A RADIO
FOR 3305?

568
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:33,901
WE DON'T SALUTE WHEN
WE'RE UNCOVERED, MISTER.

569
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,567
HAVE YOU STOWED
YOUR LOCKER YET?

570
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:41,033
OH, YES, YES, YES.

571
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,067
WHOSE STUFF
IS THAT?

572
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,934
MINE, SIR. YOU SEE,
IT DIDN'T QUITE FIT.

573
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,901
BETTER START OVER AGAIN AND MAKE IT FIT.

574
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:47,367
THERE ARE
YOUR RULES.

575
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:48,567
YES, SIR.

576
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:50,901
HOW'S ABOUT
A RADIO?

577
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:55,133
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TWO YEARS
TO RATE A RADIO IN YOUR ROOM.

578
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,067
A MAN THAT'S BEEN
RAISED ON RADIOS

579
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,400
CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT A RADIO.

580
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,701
AND SINCE I'M A MAN WHO
KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT A RADIO,

581
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,100
I'M GOING TO HAVE
A RADIO,

582
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,234
EVEN IF THE GREAT DICK MELVILLE
ISN'T ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS.

583
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,834
AND TO BE SURE,
I WAS ALWAYS ONE

584
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,167
TO LISTEN IN
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS.

585
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:08,734
I STILL GOT TO HAVE
A RADIO,

586
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,801
EVEN IF MR. MELVILLE IS IN
ANNAPOLIS AND NOT STATION WBNY,

587
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:14,634
AND FURTHERMORE, I'M
GOING TO HAVE A RADIO!

588
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,567
SQUEEZE HARD.

589
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:20,567
200.

590
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:24,234
225.

591
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,400
180.

592
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,133
OK.

593
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,734
PULL. PULL HARD.

594
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,167
60.

595
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,934
NEXT.

596
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:53,267
SQUARE YOUR HATS!

597
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,567
SQUAD, ATTENTION!

598
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,267
RIGHT FACE!

599
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,601
LEFT FACE!

600
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,634
MR. LINCOLN, HOLD YOUR
HAT IN YOUR RIGHT HAND.

601
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,667
YOU SURE THAT'S
YOUR RIGHT HAND?

602
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:09,701
YES, SIR.

603
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,968
REMEMBER IT.

604
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,601
HOW YOU FEELING?

605
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,033
OK, PAL.

606
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,100
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

607
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,501
MORNING.

608
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,033
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

609
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,033
I AM, SIR.

610
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,767
MIDSHIPMAN MELVILLE,
FOURTH CLASS.

611
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:05,801
PLACE HIM ON THE REPORT.
DUST BEHIND THE RADIATOR.

612
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,767
SORRY, DICK. NEXT TIME,
ONE OF US WILL BE IN CHARGE.

613
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,234
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT BEARING
DUST HAS ON MY BECOMING AN OFFICER.

614
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,667
YOU THINK WE'D LOSE
A NAVAL BATTLE

615
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,934
JUST BECAUSE WE LEFT A SQUARE
INCH OF DUST BEHIND A RADIATOR?

616
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,567
I WASN'T GONNA
SAY ANYTHING,

617
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,200
BUT INASMUCH
AS I HEAR,

618
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,033
YOUR FATHER WAS THE ADMIRAL
OF THE FLEET AWHILE BACK.

619
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,400
SEEMS TO ME LIKE
AN ADMIRAL'S SON

620
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,767
WOULD KNOW MORE
ABOUT THOSE THINGS

621
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:30,167
THAN A MERE GUY FROM ARIZONA
WHO WAS WEANED ON DUST

622
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,434
AND JUST DON'T LIKE IT
BY INSTINCT.

623
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:35,834
MIDSHIPMAN MELVILLE?

624
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:36,901
YES, SIR.

625
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:38,234
REPORT TODAY TO
THE SUPERINTENDENT.

626
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,400
AYE, AYE, SIR.

627
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:40,734
CARRY ON.

628
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,667
YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR?

629
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,734
WELL, HELLO, DICK.

630
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:47,801
HELLO, DAD.

631
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,200
I HAD HOPED YOU'D
CALL ON ME AT THE HOUSE.

632
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:52,400
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO FEEL
THAT I WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE

633
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,400
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,
SIR.

634
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:54,701
THAT'S COMMENDABLE,

635
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,267
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE
IS GOING TO CRITICIZE A SON

636
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,100
FOR CALLING ON
HIS OWN FATHER.

637
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,634
YOUR WHITES DON'T
SEEM TO FIT YOU YET,

638
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:05,567
BUT THEY'LL SOON SHRINK
DOWN TO YOUR SIZE.

639
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:09,234
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO
CONGRATULATE YOU BEFORE, MY SON.

640
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,167
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

641
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,801
TELL ME, HOW DO YOU
LIKE THE ACADEMY?

642
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:19,334
I THINK I MADE A FOOL OUT OF
MYSELF BY COMING HERE, SIR.

643
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:25,234
MIDSHIPMAN MELVILLE, YOU HAVE A
GREAT MANY LESSONS TO LEARN HERE,

644
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,667
AND A FEW IDEAS OF YOUR
OWN YOU'D BETTER FORGET.

645
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,133
I SUGGEST YOU REPORT
BACK TO YOUR QUARTERS

646
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,267
AND THINK THEM OVER.

647
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,501
AYE, AYE, SIR.

648
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,667
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

649
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:58,300
HELLO, MISTER.

650
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,534
HAVE YOU A TWIN BROTHER
IN NEW YORK WHO SINGS

651
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,968
AND DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN THE NAVY?

652
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,300
NO, I HAVEN'T
A TWIN BROTHER.

653
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,300
I'M THE SAME DUCK YOU
TALKED TO IN NEW YORK,

654
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,734
ONLY I SUDDENLY WENT
SOFT IN THE HEAD.

655
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:10,901
WHAT HAPPENED, DICK?

656
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:11,934
I DON'T KNOW.

657
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,200
<i>BANDS PLAYING
STARS AND STRIPES,</i>

658
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,167
PEOPLE SCREAMING
AND HOLLERING,

659
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,834
DAD GOING OVER THE
SIDE, BLOOD WILL TELL,

660
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:18,901
I DON'T KNOW.

661
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:21,400
I JUST WENT OFF MY NUT AND HERE I AM.

662
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,901
FURTHERMORE, I WISH
I HAD A TWIN BROTHER

663
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:26,300
SO HE COULD TRADE
PLACES WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

664
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,934
I HAVE TO BE AT BANCROFT
IN TIME FOR FORMATION.

665
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
DICK...

666
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:33,367
FORGET WHAT I SAID
ABOUT NAVY IN NEW YORK.

667
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,400
I'D LIKE YOU TO COME
SEE ME.

668
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,267
I'D LIKE TO
SEE YOU, TOO.

669
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:40,300
ONLY UNFORTUNATELY,

670
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,234
THEY HAVE A BOOK OF
REGULATIONS AROUND HERE,

671
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,767
AND PLEBES AREN'T
ALLOWED OUT OF THESE WALLS

672
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,100
EXCEPT ON LABOR DAY

673
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,567
AND WHAT IS LAUGHINGLY
CALLED INDEPENDENCE DAY.

674
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:54,968
GOOD-BYE.

675
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,601

TO GO THROUGH 4 SOLID YEARS

849
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:26,234
OF THIS NAVY RATTLETRAP,
YOU'RE CRAZY.

850
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,434
OH, THERE, THERE,
MR. MOUNT VESUVIUS.

851
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:31,767
AFTER THE WAY YOU
TALKED IN NEW YORK,

852
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:34,167
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND

853
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:35,367
ABOUT THE ACADEMY.

854
00:46:35,434 --> 00:46:37,501
BUT NOW YOU'RE HERE,
IT'S DIFFERENT.

855
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,267
NO, NO, IT ISN'T.

856
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:41,901
I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS
PLACE ON A GREASED SLIDE.

857
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,400
WHAT DOES YOUR FATHER
SAY ABOUT THAT?

858
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,300
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY DAD
UP CLOSE IN 3 MONTHS.

859
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:50,267
NOBODY'S GOING TO SAY
I'M GREASING MY OLD MAN.

860
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:52,267
I'M NOT GOING
TO SEE HIM, EITHER.

861
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:53,767
I'M JUST GOING
TO CLEAR OUT.

862
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,300
IT MAY BE TOUGH
TO GET IN HERE,

863
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,667
BUT THEY SAY IT'S EASY
TO GET OUT IF YOU WANT TO.

864
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,567
I'M JUST GOING TO
RESIGN, THAT'S ALL.

865
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:01,367
WE CAN PICK UP
WHERE WE WERE

866
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:03,200
BEFORE I MADE THE
MISTAKE OF COMING HERE.

867
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:06,400
DICK... IF YOU QUIT
THE ACADEMY,

868
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,534
I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU
AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE.

869
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:11,968
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
ME TO STAY OUT OF THE NAVY!

870
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:13,300
WELL, THAT WAS TRUE.

871
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,934
WE TALKED OF STARS
AND GOT A LITTLE DIZZY.

872
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
AND WE TALKED ABOUT
MARRIAGE AND THINGS.

873
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:20,567
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND NOW.

874
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:23,701
YOU CHOSE TO ENTER
THE ACADEMY.

875
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:25,267
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO GO YELLOW

876
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:27,901
ON WHAT YOU SWORE TO DO
WHEN YOU BECAME A MIDSHIPMAN-

877
00:47:27,968 --> 00:47:29,834
BUT I'M NOT GOING
YELLOW, I'M JUST QUITTING.

878
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:32,000
IF YOU QUIT ANYTHING
YOU SWORE TO DO,

879
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:35,100
WHETHER IT BE NAVY
OR THE NORTH POLE,

880
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,634
I WOULDN'T THINK
VERY MUCH OF YOU.

881
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,767
OH, YOU DON'T
MAKE SENSE.

882
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:43,734
IF I STAY IN THE ACADEMY,
YOU WON'T MARRY ME

883
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:45,300
BECAUSE THAT
MAKES ME A NAVY MAN.

884
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:48,300
YOU LOST YOUR FATHER AND
BROTHER THAT WAY, IS THAT RIGHT?

885
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:50,534
AND IF I GET OUT
OF THE ACADEMY

886
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,100
NOW THAT I'M IN IT, YOU
WON'T SEE ME ANYMORE.

887
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,801
IS THAT RIGHT, TOO?

888
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:57,400
YES. THAT'S RIGHT, TOO.

889
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:03,667
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SAID GOOD AFTERNOON?

890
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:06,868
I'M GOING SLOWLY AND
COMPLETELY DAFFY.

891
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:14,400
AND THAT, SIR, IS THAT
MIDSHIPMAN'S OPINION

892
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:16,434
OF THE UNITED STATES
NAVAL ACADEMY.

893
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:20,300
IF YOU WERE HE, SIR, WHAT WOULD
YOU DO? STAY IN OR GET OUT?

894
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:21,901
IF I WERE THAT BOY,

895
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:24,300
I'D GET OUT AS FAST
AS I COULD.

896
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:25,934
YOU WOULD, SIR?

897
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,133
YES.

898
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,934
BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
MIDSHIPMAN IN THE ACADEMY

899
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,067
ANSWERING THE DESCRIPTION
YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

900
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:35,100
IF HE IS HERE,
HE CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO BE.

901
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,767
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE
BELLIGERENT YOUNG NINCOMPOOP

902
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,634
YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED
ISN'T MY SON.

903
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:43,067
THE SPIRIT OF THE ACADEMY
INCLUDES MANY ELEMENTS

904
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:45,334
BESIDES THE QUALITIES
OF HONOR,

905
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,133
PERSONAL INTEGRITY,
AND LOYALTY TO THE SERVICE.

906
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,267
IT INCLUDES
SPORTSMANSHIP-

907
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:53,734
THE SPIRIT THAT ENABLES A MAN
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE AND TAKE.

908
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:56,300
AND UNLESS THAT MIDSHIPMAN
CAN LEARN THAT QUALITY,

909
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,701
HE MAY FIND HIMSELF
IN THE UNFORTUNATE POSITION

910
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:02,000
OF WORKING UP THROUGH
HIS CLASSES WITH NO PALS,

911
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,567
NO FRIENDS... ALONE.

912
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:07,534
THANK YOU, SIR.

913
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:08,901
PERHAPS THAT'S
THE COURSE

914
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:11,100
THAT MIDSHIPMAN
MAY CHOOSE TO STEER.

915
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,133
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

916
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,868
MISTER?

917
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:22,133
I'VE NOTICED
A FADING AWAY

918
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,067
OF YOUR SPIRITS
OF LATE,

919
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,567
AND I FEEL, MISTER, THAT
IT'S PERHAPS DUE TO THE LOSS

920
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:28,267
OF YOUR LATE LAMENTED PUBLIC ACCLAIM.

921
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:31,300
AND AS AN ANTIDOTE TO
THAT GRIEVOUS CONDITION,

922
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,334
THE FIRST CLASSMEN ARE
WILLING TO BE GENEROUS.

923
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,100
THEIR DRAGS ARE WITH
THEM IN SMOKE HALL.

924
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,234
THEIR HEARTS ARE INFLAMED
AT THE VERY THOUGHT

925
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,834
OF HEARING THE GOLDEN
VOICE OF PLEBE DICK MELVILLE

926
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,968
SING A HEART SONG
TO THEIR LADYLOVES-

927
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:44,801
WITH, PERHAPS,
THE VAIN HOPE

928
00:49:44,868 --> 00:49:46,868
THAT THE LADYLOVES MIGHT
BECOME AMOROUSLY AFFECTED,

929
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:48,367
SENTIMENTALLY
INCLINED,

930
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:51,400
AND WILLING TO WAIT FOR TWO
YEARS AFTER OUR GRADUATION

931
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,834
FOR THE CONGRESSIONALLY
DELAYED NUPTIALS.

932
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:57,601
IN OTHER WORDS,
MISTER, FOLLOW ME.

933
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,734
THERE YOU ARE,
MISTER.

934
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:23,968
NOW YOU CAN TURN ON
YOUR PERSONALITY.

935
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:25,901
AYE, AYE, SIR.

936
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:30,868
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

937
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:33,300
WHAT WILL BE
YOUR FANCY, SIR?

938
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,501
OH, JUST TURN IT ON.

939
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,534
AYE, AYE, SIR.

940
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:52,667
* WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME
TO MARCH OR TO HALT *

941
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:58,467
* MY SOUL REBELS,
I'M THAT WAY TO A FAULT *

942
00:50:58,534 --> 00:51:04,067
* NO RULES OR REGULATIONS
WOULD I OBEY *

943
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:11,601
* THEN I MET YOU,
AND I KNEW RIGHT AWAY *

944
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,701
* IF YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN

945
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:19,100
* I'LL BE THE CREW

946
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,734
* 'CAUSE I JUST LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

947
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:26,133
,

948
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,834
* YOU BLOW THE BUGLE

949
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:31,801
* AND I'LL JUMP THROUGH

950
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:37,167
* OH, HOW I'D LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

951
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:40,467
* I KNOW THAT RULES
WERE MADE FOR FOOLS *

952
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:43,534
* THAT'S ONE THING
I HAVE LEARNED *

953
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,834
* BUT I'M GOING IN
FOR DISCIPLINE *

954
00:51:46,901 --> 00:51:49,701
* WHEREVER YOU'RE CONCERNED

955
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:53,934
* IF YOU SAY, "KISS ME"

956
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,133
* THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO

957
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,834
* 'CAUSE I JUST LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

958
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,334
* IF YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN

959
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,501
* I'LL BE THE CREW

960
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:14,133
* 'CAUSE I JUST LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

961
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,767
* YOU BLOW THE BUGLE

962
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,734
* AND I'LL JUMP THROUGH

963
00:52:20,801 --> 00:52:26,000
* OH, HOW I'D LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

964
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:29,100
* I KNOW THAT RULES
WERE MADE FOR FOOLS *

965
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:32,634
* THAT'S ONE THING
I HAVE LEARNED *

966
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:35,367
* BUT I'M GOING IN
FOR DISCIPLINE *

967
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:38,033
* WHEREVER YOU'RE CONCERNED

968
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,501
WAS THIS YOUR
BRIGHT IDEA, GIFFORD?

969
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:42,000
DO YOU REALIZE WE'RE LOSING OUR DRAGS

970
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,367
TO THE PLEBE
OF THE VOICE?

971
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:45,200
* THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO

972
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:53,501
* 'CAUSE I JUST LOVE TO
TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU *

973
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:55,901
THAT'S ENOUGH.

974
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,334
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR?

975
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,834
I SAID,
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH.

976
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:01,567
AW, NO! NO! NO!

977
00:53:01,634 --> 00:53:02,801
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

978
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:04,501
CERTAINLY, NO GENTLEMAN IN THE ACADEMY

979
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:05,901
COULD DENY THE REQUEST OF LADIES,

980
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:07,501
NO MATTER HOW GREAT
THE SACRIFICE.

981
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:09,934
IN MY CASE, IT'S A
DISTINCT PLEASURE TO OBLIGE.

982
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,634
THAT IS, IF YOU
DON'T MIND, SIR.

983
00:53:12,701 --> 00:53:17,367
* EVERY TIME YOUR LIPS SAY,
"NO, SIR" *

984
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:21,968
* I WON'T LISTEN,
I'M TOO WISE *

985
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,267
* I WOULD RATHER LISTEN

986
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:28,567
* TO YOUR EYES

987
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:34,234
* THEY HAVE TOLD ME
LOTS OF THINGS, DEAR *

988
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,267
* THAT YOUR BETTER SELF DENIES

989
00:53:38,334 --> 00:53:41,234
* SO I'D RATHER LISTEN

990
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,133
* TO THOSE EYES

991
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,534
* THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD EVER SAY *

992
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,701
* THAT COULD CONVEY

993
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:55,100
* THE PROMISE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR *

994
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,634
* I LOOK IN YOUR EYES

995
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:03,701
* AND REALIZE THAT
THEY CAN TELL ME MORE *

996
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:09,567
* EYES CAN BE SINCERE
AND TRUTHFUL *

997
00:54:09,634 --> 00:54:13,667
* LIPS CAN TELL A LOT OF LIES

998
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:16,467
* SO I'D RATHER LISTEN

999
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:25,834
* TO YOUR EYES

1000
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,234
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

1001
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,300
THANK YOU, LADIES, FOR
LISTENING. YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

1002
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,801
AND THANK YOU, SIR,
FOR THE ASSIGNMENT.

1003
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:34,234
IT WAS
A REAL PLEASURE.

1004
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,434
Women: AW...

1005
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:37,167
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1006
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:40,501
WHY DIDN'T YOU
LET HIM SING MORE?

1007
00:54:45,434 --> 00:54:48,200
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE LOST A ROOMMATE.

1008
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:49,834
WHAT HAPPENED?

1009
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:51,801
ALL I KNOW IS
HE WANTED A ROOM ALONE.

1010
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:54,267
SAID HE WANTED TO
CONCENTRATE ON HIS STUDIES.

1011
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,434
HE'S MOVED IN THAT SINGLE
ROOM DOWN THE CORRIDOR.

1012
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,100
HE TOLD ME ROOMMATES WERE DESIGNED
MERELY TO SHARE THEIR ROOMS,

1013
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,701
NOT THEIR THOUGHTS
AND CONVERSATIONS.

1014
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:03,868
AS FAR AS
HE'S CONCERNED,

1015
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,834
THE WHOLE CLASS CAN CONSIDER
HIM DEAF AND DUMB FROM NOW ON.

1016
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,334
HE DIDN'T WANT
ANY PART OF US.

1017
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,968
ALL I GOT TO SAY, BOY,

1018
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:12,968
IS THAT HE'S GONNA
FIND IT A LONESOME ROAD.

1019
00:55:15,934 --> 00:55:18,234
Dick on radio:
* SHIPMATES STAND TOGETHER

1020
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,934
* DON'T GIVE UP
THE SHIP... *

1021
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:22,767
Announcer: THIS IS
A DICK MELVILLE RECORDING.

1022
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:25,901
* FAIR OR STORMY WEA-

1023
00:55:55,634 --> 00:55:56,934
UH, TREE'S UP.

1024
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,667
COXSWAIN'S
UNSATISFACTORY AGAIN.

1025
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,601
OH, I'M NOT SCARED.

1026
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,767
I'M GOING TO BEAR DOWN
FOR THOSE FINAL EXAMINATIONS.

1027
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:03,834
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1028
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:05,267
SAY, DO YOU KNOW
WHO STANDS

1029
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:06,567
AT THE HEAD
OF THE CLASS NOW?

1030
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:08,100
UH-HUH.

1031
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:10,601
DICK THE MELVILLE.

1032
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:14,267
RIGHT. AND IF THAT'S ALL
HE'S GETTING OUT OF THE ACADEMY,

1033
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:16,167
I HOPE HE ENJOYS IT.

1034
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:19,033
GANG...
I'M ABOUT TO UNVEIL

1035
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,000
THE MIRACLE
OF ROOM 3305.

1036
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:25,367
Prepare yourselves
for a surprise.

1037
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:28,100
Shh...

1038
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,767
RAISED ON RADIO,

1039
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:41,767
WEANED ON RADIO.

1040
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,267
GOT TO HAVE
A RADIO...

1041
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,968
GOT A RADIO!

1042
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:55,267
ANTENNA DOWN
THE SHOWER PIPE.

1043
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:57,067
GROUND THROUGH
THE LEG OF THE BED.

1044
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,434
RADIO!

1045
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:00,901
Where?

1046
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,300
YOU GOT ME!

1047
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:06,000
* IN THE MATTRESS

1048
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:08,133
SPARKS, YOU'LL GET WORSE
THAN DEATH IF YOU GET CAUGHT!

1049
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,167
CAUGHT?

1050
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:12,968
YOU MAY NEED THOSE BRAINS,
SPARKS, WHEN YOU GO INTO THE FLEET.

1051
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:14,701
GET THAT THING OUT OF THERE
AND THROW IT IN THE SEVERN!

1052
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:16,968
YOU DON'T KNOW-

1053
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,934
THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
I HEARD A RADIO IN HERE.

1054
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,234
UH... DIDYOU, SIR?

1055
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,667
HMM...

1056
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,567
<i>I DON'T SEE ANY RADIO.</i>

1057
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:31,567
I DON'T SEE
HOW YOU...

1058
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:34,100
<i>COULD, SIR.</i>

1059
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:38,267
YES, A RADIO IS A HARD
THING TO HIDE, ISN'T IT?

1060
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:40,601
YES, SIR.

1061
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,100
YES,
INDEED, SIR.

1062
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,634
WOULD HAVE SWORN
I HEARD A RADIO.

1063
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:52,133
CARRY ON!

1064
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,767
All: OH!

1065
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:00,200
YOU GOT DYNAMITE IN YOUR
MATTRESS, SPARKS! DYNAMITE!

1066
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,133
Oh.

1067
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:10,133
I GOT ONE.
GOT WHAT?

1068
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,868
A LITTLE
TECUMSEH.

1069
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,601
Cowboy: HEH!

1070
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:16,234
Sparks: AH!
WHO SHRIVELED HIM UP?

1071
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,734
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT!

1072
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,767
DON'T GET HIM SORE AT YOU,
OR ELSE THEY'LL BE ASKING YOU

1073
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,601
TO WALK OUT THE FRONT
GATE IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES!

1074
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,067
THAT FELLA'S A VERY
TOUCHY LITTLE GUY, COWBOY.

1075
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,667
YOU BETTER PRAY TO
HIM FOR FORGIVENESS.

1076
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:26,934
HEH! WHAT FOR?

1077
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,067
WELL, HE'S THE GOD OF
ALL WOODEN MIDSHIPMEN.

1078
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,567
IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH
THIS ACADEMY WITHOUT ANY GRIEF,

1079
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,200
YOU BETTER START GETTING
CHUMMY WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

1080
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:35,701
PRAY TO HIM, COWBOY.

1081
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:38,901
WHEN YOU GET THROUGH PRAYING FOR
YOURSELF, PUT IN A WORD FOR ME,

1082
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:41,767
BECAUSE IF I DON'T PASS THIS TEAM,
I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE NEXT YEAR.

1083
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:43,767
TECUMSEH, EH? HEH HEH!

1084
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:46,767
YOU KNOW, I'D FEEL KIND OF SILLY
PRAYING TO A THING LIKE THIS.

1085
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:50,601
Coxswain: YEAH? A LOT OF MIDSHIPMEN
THAT ARE NOW ADMIRALS DIDN'T FEEL SO.

1086
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:53,367
WELL... HOW DO YOU
DO IT, THEN?

1087
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:55,234
I'LL SHOW YOU. HAVE YOU GOT ANY PENNIES?

1088
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,934
PENNIES?
YEAH. HERE.

1089
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,467
HERE.

1090
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:04,934
TECUMSEH, OLD BOY,

1091
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,701
EVERYTHING ISN'T
EXACTLY HUNKY-DORY

1092
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,701
WITH COXSWAIN
AND COWBOY.

1093
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,701
WITH ME, EITHER,
FOR THAT MATTER.

1094
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,434
GIVE US A BREAK ON
THESE EXAMS, WILL YOU?

1095
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,634
THE 3 OF US STARTED
TOGETHER AND...

1096
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:18,901
THAT'S THE WAY I THINK WE
OUGHT TO FINISH UP, DON'T YOU?

1097
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:21,234
SO DON'T BEAR DOWN
TOO HARD ON US.

1098
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,334
<i>REMEMBER, YOU'VE GOT
A WOODEN HEAD, TOO.</i>

1099
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,434
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

1100
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:35,901
HOW'D YOU COME OUT,
COXSWAIN?

1101
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,200
OK!
GOOD!

1102
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:38,734
WELL, I GUESS I WON'T
HAVE TO GO BACK

1103
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:40,634
TO LASSOING STEERS
FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

1104
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:42,767
YEP. UNCLE SAM, IN
HIS INFINITE WISDOM,

1105
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:45,701
HAS DECIDED TO KEEP 3305
INTACT FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

1106
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:46,734
HA HA!

1107
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,634
Man: YIPPEE!

1108
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:59,100
WELL, DAD, THAT'S
ONE YEAR CHECKED OFF.

1109
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,968
YES, YES.

1110
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:03,434
<i>WHY AREN'T YOU
WITH YOUR CLASSMATES?</i>

1111
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:04,934
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1112
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
SOME OF THESE TRADITIONS
SEEM LIKE HORSEPLAY TO ME.

1113
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:09,033
THERE'S NOTHING IN
THE BOOK OF REGULATIONS

1114
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,767
THAT SAYS I HAVE TO DANCE
AROUND THE HERNDON MONUMENT

1115
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:12,200
JUST BECAUSE I PASS
PLEBE YEAR.

1116
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:13,767
HEH!

1117
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:16,300
YOU'RE... STUBBORN.

1118
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:18,000
YOU'RE YOUNG,

1119
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:20,033
AND YOU'RE WRONG.

1120
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,968
SOMETIMES I WISH
I WERE ALREADY RETIRED,

1121
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,067
NOT SUPERINTENDENT
OF THE ACADEMY.

1122
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:27,567
IT WOULD PUT ME IN A BETTER
POSITION TO SPEAK TO YOU-

1123
01:00:27,634 --> 01:00:30,267
AS A FATHER,
NOT AN OFFICER.

1124
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:31,901
BUT REMEMBER THIS-

1125
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:33,801
I'D FAR RATHER HAVE
A SON WHO DIDN'T STAND

1126
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:35,501
AT THE HEAD OF HIS
CLASS IN STUDIES

1127
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:38,534
IF IT ALSO MEANS THAT HE STANDS
AT THE FOOT OF HIS CLASS...

1128
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,400
IN FRIENDSHIP.

1129
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:42,868
YOU WANTED ME TO
GRADUATE FROM THE ACADEMY

1130
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:44,400
AND I'M GOING
TO DO IT,

1131
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:46,801
BUT I HAVE MY OWN RIGHT TO
CHOOSE THE WAY OF DOING SO.

1132
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:48,567
OH, SON...

1133
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:51,033
YOU'RE TYING
YOUR OWN HANG KNOT.

1134
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,100
YOU CAN'T LEAVE HERE
AND GO INTO THE NAVY

1135
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,100
AND EXPECT TO SERVE
WITH FELLOW OFFICERS

1136
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:58,267
WHOM YOU REFUSE
TO MEET AS FRIENDS.

1137
01:00:58,334 --> 01:00:59,901
I HAVE NO DESIRE
WHATSOEVER

1138
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:02,968
TO ENTER THE NAVY
UPON GRADUATION.

1139
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,934
OH.

1140
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,334
I WON MY WAY
INTO THIS PLACE.

1141
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,200
I HAVE A CHANCE
TO GRADUATE.

1142
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:17,868
I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO ACCEPT OR REJECT

1143
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:19,534
MY COMMISSION WHEN
IT'S OFFERED TO ME.

1144
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:20,868
WELL...

1145
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:22,868
<i>SINCE THAT IS YOUR
DECISION,</i>

1146
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,868
SINCE YOU'RE WILLING
TO TAKE FROM YOUR COUNTRY

1147
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:26,868
WITH NO THOUGHT
OF GIVING IN RETURN-

1148
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,234
EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOUR
PRIVILEGE UNDER THE LAW-

1149
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,968
FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR
CAREER HERE AS A MIDSHIPMAN,

1150
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:36,634
I PREFER THAT YOU REGARD ME AS THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY.

1151
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:42,033
<i>YOU'RE NOT MY SON.</i>

1152
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:48,767
AYE AYE, SIR.

1153
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,801
Man: HELLO,
MR. MELVILLE.

1154
01:01:55,868 --> 01:01:57,534
UH, MARCELLUS,
YES, SIR?

1155
01:01:57,601 --> 01:01:58,901
IS MISS BLACKBURN
STILL IN THERE?

1156
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:02,067
YES, SIR. SHE'S BEEN DANCING
THOSE KIDS FOR AN HOUR OR SO.

1157
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:04,734
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

1158
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:39,067
WELL, JOE, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

1159
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:41,467
I'VE BEEN A SISSY
LONG ENOUGH!

1160
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:43,200
OH, YOU HAVE,
HAVE YOU?

1161
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:45,400
WELL, YOU GO OVER THERE AND SIT DOWN.

1162
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,067
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN.
COME ON.

1163
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:35,100
HERE, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

1164
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,567
WHY AREN'T YOU DANCING?

1165
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:39,067
<i>WE'D RATHER SEE YOU DANCE,
MISS BLACKBURN.</i>

1166
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:40,400
OH, NO, NONE OF THAT.

1167
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:43,000
NOW, COME ON. LET'S FINISH
THIS ROUTINE. LOTS OF PEP.

1168
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:48,300
1, 2, 3, 4.

1169
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,601
JUMP!

1170
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,901
OH, THAT'S FINE.
GOOD-BYE, DARLINGS.

1171
01:03:55,968 --> 01:03:57,200
THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY.

1172
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,901
Children: BYE! BYE!

1173
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,901
GOOD-BYE.

1174
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:03,167
WELL, TEACHER, YOU'RE DOING A
GREAT JOB WITH THOSE CHILDREN.

1175
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,567
I DON'T THINK
I'D HAVE THE PATIENCE.

1176
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:06,234
GOOD-BYE,
MISS BLACKBURN.

1177
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,367
I WON'T BE COMING TO YOUR
DANCING CLASS ANYMORE.

1178
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:11,901
WHY, DARLING?
ARE YOU GOING AWAY?

1179
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:15,968
WELL, DAD, MOM, AND ME GOT
ORDERS, FOR THE CHINA STATION.

1180
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:17,234
CHINA?

1181
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,033
OH, DARLING,
WE'LL MISS YOU!

1182
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,534
ARE YOU GLAD YOU'RE
GOING?

1183
01:04:20,601 --> 01:04:23,534
WELL, DAD AND MOM
AND ME'S IN THE NAVY.

1184
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:27,067
WE GOT ORDERS, SO WE'RE
GOING TO CHINA NEXT SATURDAY.

1185
01:04:27,133 --> 01:04:28,868
SO GOOD-BYE,
MISS BLACKBURN.

1186
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:29,834
GOOD-BYE, DARLING.

1187
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:31,300
I'LL SEND YOU
A POSTCARD.

1188
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,334
THANK YOU.

1189
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,467
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

1190
01:04:34,534 --> 01:04:37,200
SOMEDAY I'M GOING
TO BE A MIDSHIPMAN

1191
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:39,100
LIKE YOU, TOO.

1192
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,200
BE A GOOD BOY.

1193
01:04:40,267 --> 01:04:41,534
YES, SIR.

1194
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:43,601
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE,
DICK. I WANT TO CHANGE.

1195
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,067
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

1196
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,567
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS,
DICK.

1197
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:54,033
MY UNCLE HAS BEEN PASSED
OVER IN THE LAST SELECTION.

1198
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,868
HE'S AUTOMATICALLY
RETIRED.

1199
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,400
THAT'S THE NAVY
FOR YOU.

1200
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,701
HE SERVES 25 YEARS, AND
OVERNIGHT HE'S THROUGH.

1201
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:03,834
THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR SO
MANY CAPTAINS IN THE NAVY.

1202
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,567
<i>SOME COMMANDERS
HAVE TO BE PASSED BY.</i>

1203
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:08,367
WELL, ARE YOU, UH...

1204
01:05:08,434 --> 01:05:10,400
IS HE LEAVING HERE?

1205
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:13,400
HE'LL HAVE TO START IN
AGAIN AT A CIVILIAN JOB.

1206
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:16,067
THERE'S NOTHING
HE CAN DO IN ANNAPOLIS.

1207
01:05:16,133 --> 01:05:18,067
ARE YOU GOING WITH HIM? NO.

1208
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,534
I HAVE TO START OUT
ON MY OWN, TOO.

1209
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:21,934
WHERE?

1210
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,934
WELL... ALL I KNOW
HOW TO DO IS DANCE.

1211
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,133
I GUESS THAT MEANS...
NEW YORK.

1212
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:33,100
I'LL GIVE YOU A LETTER TO
THE BOYS IN THE BAND, DARLING.

1213
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:34,334
THEY'LL HELP YOU.

1214
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,701
AH AH!

1215
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:38,234
THERE'S THE LONE WOLF OF
BANCROFT HALL DEAD AHEAD, BOYS.

1216
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,934
WHAT DO WE DO
- TURN AROUND OR GO BACK?

1217
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,067
LET'S RECOGNIZE HIM AND IF HE
SPEAKS TO US, ASK HIM TO JOIN US.

1218
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:44,100
WELL, IF HE DON'T SPEAK
TO US, WE'LL JUST SUBMERGE

1219
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:46,234
AND GO RIGHT ON BY.

1220
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,934
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE I'M
DESERTING YOU, DOESN'T IT?

1221
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:56,834
HELLO.

1222
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:07,834
Men: * O THE LIFEBOAT
CREW ARE WE *

1223
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,334
* AND WE SAIL
THE STORMY SEA *

1224
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,133
* DA DA DA DA DA...

1225
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:17,400
Men: * WHOA,
THE LIFEBOAT CREW ARE WE... *

1226
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:19,901
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WHEN I'M GONE?

1227
01:06:19,968 --> 01:06:21,567
I DON'T KNOW.

1228
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,667
OH, BUT WE'LL HAVE
SEPTEMBER LEAVE TOGETHER.

1229
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,234
WE CAN HAVE A LOT
OF FUN IN NEW YORK.

1230
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,968
WE'LL GO OUT IN CENTRAL
PARK AND TAKE A RIDE

1231
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:28,400
IN ONE OF THOSE
FUNNY HORSE THINGS.

1232
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:29,701
AND WILL WE GO
TO THE ZOO?

1233
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,100
MM-HMM, THEY'VE GOT A
NEW PINK RHINOCEROS THERE.

1234
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,734
AND WILL WE GO
TO THE AQUARIUM?

1235
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:34,901
UH-HUH.
AND CONEY ISLAND?

1236
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:36,934
SURE, AND
TO GRANT'S TOMB.

1237
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,934
WE'LL HAVE A LOT
OF FUN IN NEW YORK.

1238
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,434
OH, DARLING,
WHEN I GET TO NEW YORK,

1239
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,434
I'M NOT GOING OUT
WITH ANYBODY.

1240
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:46,634
<i>I'M JUST GOING
TO BE YOUR GIRL.</i>

1241
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:16,734
STEAM EXAM'S GOING TO GET ME!
STEAM! WHO KNOWS HIS STEAM?

1242
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:18,234
DON'T HAVE
THE TIME.

1243
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,734
SAY, YOU FELLAS WANT TO SEE
ME BILGE OUT OF THE ACADEMY?

1244
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:23,000
DOESN'T ANYBODY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THESE STEAM PROBLEMS?

1245
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,200
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
ASK DICK MELVILLE?

1246
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:25,200
Man: SURE, HE'S
THE SAVVY MAN.

1247
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:26,167
HE STANDS FIRST
IN THE CLASS.

1248
01:07:26,234 --> 01:07:27,601
HE COULD HELP YOU,
COXSWAIN.

1249
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,734
THANKS.

1250
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,601
TECUMSEH...

1251
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:57,100
THEY DO A LOT OF TALKING
AROUND HERE ABOUT...

1252
01:07:57,167 --> 01:08:00,968
HOW YOU'VE HELPED DUMB GUYS
LIKE ME PASS THEIR EXAMINATIONS.

1253
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:03,934
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY'RE KIDDING ME.

1254
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,601
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT, BUT...

1255
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,467
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE A CHANCE.

1256
01:08:14,033 --> 01:08:16,067
IF YOU'LL HELP ME...

1257
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,934
I... WELL...

1258
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,100
<i>I WON'T FORGET IT, EVER!</i>

1259
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:24,467
AND I'LL TELL ALL
THE FELLAS

1260
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:27,934
HOW SWELL YOU WERE
TO HELP ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU.

1261
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:42,267
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
THE SECTION AS A WHOLE

1262
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:44,067
DID VERY WELL ON
THE FINAL EXAMINATIONS,

1263
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:47,400
BUT ONE OR TWO OF YOU
FAILED RATHER BADLY.

1264
01:08:47,467 --> 01:08:50,567
WITHOUT A PERFECT
RECITATION TODAY,

1265
01:08:50,634 --> 01:08:54,100
I'M AFRAID SOME OF YOU
ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING US.

1266
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,601
ANY QUESTIONS?

1267
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:58,434
DRAW YOUR SLIPS,
GENTLEMEN.

1268
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,167
MAN THE BOARDS.

1269
01:09:39,901 --> 01:09:42,968
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL, LAWRENCE,
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVING HERE,

1270
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:45,501
THAT YOU'VE LOST ALL CHANCE
OF BECOMING AN OFFICER.

1271
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:47,901
COMPETITION HERE
IS PRETTY STIFF,

1272
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:51,267
AND MAYBE YOU WEREN'T
QUITE READY FOR THE ACADEMY.

1273
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:53,434
PERHAPS YOU'RE
A LITTLE TOO YOUNG.

1274
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:55,100
YES, SIR.

1275
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:58,100
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I'M CERTAIN OF, BOY-

1276
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,267
YOU'VE GOT THE HEART
FOR NAVY,

1277
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:03,434
EVEN THOUGH ACADEMICS
LICKED YOU THIS TIME.

1278
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:06,934
AND THERE ARE SOME
MIDSHIPMEN HERE WHO...

1279
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,501
HAVE THE MINDS TO MAKE
OFFICERS, BUT THEY COULD USE

1280
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:12,267
<i>A LITTLE OF THE NAVY
THAT'S IN YOUR HEART,</i>

1281
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,267
BUT...

1282
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:16,200
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

1283
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:20,067
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
AFTER YOU LEAVE HERE?

1284
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:23,901
WELL, I'M GOING BACK
INTO THE NAVY, SIR.

1285
01:10:23,968 --> 01:10:25,801
WHETHER I CAN GIVE
COMMANDS OR TAKE THEM,

1286
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:27,968
IT'S THE NAVY
FOR ME, SIR.

1287
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:30,234
WELL, YOU'RE STILL
WITHIN THE AGE LIMIT.

1288
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,167
YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN YOUR
WAY BACK HERE AND START OVER AGAIN.

1289
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:38,734
SO, GOOD-BYE
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU...

1290
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:42,934
AND I HOPE THAT WE'LL
BE SHIPMATES SOMEDAY.

1291
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,767
THANK YOU, SIR.

1292
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,100
HELLO, COXSWAIN.

1293
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:59,767
I JUST WANT TO...
TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM,

1294
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:01,767
ABOUT YOUR LEAVING
THE ACADEMY.

1295
01:11:01,834 --> 01:11:03,834
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1296
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:07,100
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?

1297
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:08,667
<i>DO YOU?</i>

1298
01:11:08,734 --> 01:11:11,467
THE ACADEMY'S NEVER MEANT
ANYTHING TO YOU, AND IT NEVER WILL!

1299
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:14,601
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH YOUR STUDIES
LIKE GREASED LIGHTNING AND FOR WHAT?

1300
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:16,934
SO YOU CAN TURN DOWN YOUR
COMMISSION WHEN YOU GRADUATE!

1301
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,701
DON'T YOU TRY TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT WHAT THE ACADEMY MEANS.

1302
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:23,033
SAVE YOUR SYMPATHY
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

1303
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,400
FORGET YOU EVER WASTED
ANY ON ME.

1304
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:34,734
I CALL IT
DARN BAD LUCK.

1305
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,934
NICE KID.

1306
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:39,033
HI, FELLA!

1307
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,234
COWBOY BROUGHT
YOUR BAG UP.

1308
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,968
THANKS, COWBOY.

1309
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:44,234
IT'S OK, KID.

1310
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,567
THE SUPERINTENDENT
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

1311
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,033
YEAH.

1312
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,400
HE SAID HE HOPED WE'D
BE SHIPMATES SOMEDAY.

1313
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:51,901
THAT'S SWELL.

1314
01:11:51,968 --> 01:11:54,067
WE HOPE THAT, TOO.

1315
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:55,767
SURE.

1316
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:58,567
GEE, COXSWAIN, WOULDN'T IT
BE FUNNY IF WE WERE

1317
01:11:58,634 --> 01:12:00,434
TO COME ABOARD YOUR SHIP
AS ENSIGNS SOMEDAY

1318
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:03,267
AND YOU HAD TO SAY,
"YES, SIR" TO-

1319
01:12:08,968 --> 01:12:11,400
HEH HEH! YEAH.

1320
01:12:11,467 --> 01:12:14,734
<i>I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TWO GUYS
TRY TO GIVE ME ORDERS.</i>

1321
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,434
FUNNY!

1322
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:18,767
<i>IT WON'T MAKE ME
LAUGH, KID.</i>

1323
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,901
I HATE
TO SEE YOU GO.

1324
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,567
THAT KIND OF GOES
FOR ME, TOO.

1325
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:36,367
REMEMBER HOW TOUGH IT WAS
TO STOW THOSE LOCKERS?

1326
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:40,767
YOU KNOW HOW DUMB WE WERE, TOO,
COXSWAIN, AND YOU HAD TO HELP US?

1327
01:12:43,133 --> 01:12:46,300
WELL, AT... LEAST
IT WILL BE EASIER

1328
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:47,734
GETTING YOUR STUFF OUT
THAN IT WAS

1329
01:12:47,801 --> 01:12:49,868
GETTING IT IN,
WON'T IT?

1330
01:12:49,934 --> 01:12:52,067
YEAH.

1331
01:12:57,267 --> 01:13:01,067
I GUESS I BETTER START
PACKING NOW, SPARKS.

1332
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,167
I GUESS I BETTER BE
ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1333
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:14,901
DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME
MAKE A JACKASS OF MYSELF.

1334
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,868
OH, MR. MELVILLE!

1335
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:39,434
HELLO, SUSIE.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1336
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:41,367
GLAD TO SEE YOU, TOO. WE
SURE MISS YOU AROUND HERE.

1337
01:14:41,434 --> 01:14:43,067
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
YOUNGER THAN EVER?

1338
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:45,501
<i>THE NAVY HASN'T CHANGED
YOUR LINE ANY, BUT I LOVE IT!</i>

1339
01:14:45,567 --> 01:14:46,868
HELLO, MR. MELVILLE!

1340
01:14:46,934 --> 01:14:48,534
HI, MABEL!

1341
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:49,734
HELLO,
MR. MELVILLE!

1342
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:51,901
HELLO, JIMMY!
HOW ARE YOU?

1343
01:14:51,968 --> 01:14:53,234
BOO!

1344
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,734
MR. MELVILLE! HAVE YOU QUIT THE NAVY?

1345
01:14:55,801 --> 01:14:57,234
ARE YOU BACK
WITH US FOR GOOD?

1346
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,400
NO, NO. I'M JUST HERE
ON A LITTLE LEAVE.

1347
01:14:59,467 --> 01:15:01,167
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

1348
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:02,667
DICK!
HELLO, HARRY.

1349
01:15:02,734 --> 01:15:04,334
WELCOME HOME! HOW DO
THEY LIKE JUNE HERE?

1350
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,567
HOW DO THEY
LIKE HER?

1351
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,667
COME ON OVER HERE
AND SIT DOWN.

1352
01:15:06,734 --> 01:15:08,901
OH, BOY, THE OLD PLACE
LOOKS JUST THE SAME.

1353
01:15:08,968 --> 01:15:10,534
UH-HUH. YOU CAN FORGET
THE COVER CHARGE.

1354
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:12,100
I'LL DO THAT.
I'M A SCHOOLBOY NOW.

1355
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:13,567
I ONLY MAKE
$3.00 A MONTH.

1356
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:35,033
HELLO, SWEETHEART.

1357
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,667
OH, DICK!
HOW ARE YOU?

1358
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:37,667
OH, YOU'RE A SIGHT
FOR SORE-

1359
01:16:39,334 --> 01:16:40,767
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1360
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:42,767
DICK MELVILLE IS HERE
IN THE SKY CLUB TONIGHT.

1361
01:16:42,834 --> 01:16:43,934
LET'S HAVE HIM SING!

1362
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:48,701
COME ON, DICK, A SONG-
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

1363
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,200
NO, HARRY. THEY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ME SING.

1364
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:52,467
YES, THEY DO.
COME ON.

1365
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:07,167
* JUST A GLANCE

1366
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:08,834
* AT A DANCE

1367
01:17:08,901 --> 01:17:12,334
* AND IN MY HEART I KNEW

1368
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,701
* THAT IF I EVER SHOULD CARE

1369
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:19,767
* THAT I WOULD CARE FOR YOU

1370
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:21,601
* THOUGH I HEARD

1371
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,067
* NOT A WORD

1372
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:26,067
* YOUR EYES BEGAN TO SAY

1373
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:30,934
* A LOT OF THINGS YOUR LIPS
HAVE NEVER TOLD ME *

1374
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,801
* TO THIS VERY DAY

1375
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:39,801
* EVERY TIME YOUR LIPS
SAY, "NO, SIR" *

1376
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:44,033
* I WON'T LISTEN, I'M TOO WISE

1377
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,968
* I WOULD RATHER LISTEN

1378
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:50,434
* TO YOUR EYES

1379
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:56,234
* THEY HAVE TOLD ME
LOTS OF THINGS, DEAR *

1380
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:00,300
* THAT YOUR BETTER SELF DENIES

1381
01:18:00,367 --> 01:18:03,467
* SO I'D RATHER LISTEN

1382
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:06,868
* TO THOSE EYES

1383
01:18:06,934 --> 01:18:10,300
* THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD EVER SAY *

1384
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,334
* THAT COULD CONVEY

1385
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,267
* THE PROMISE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR *

1386
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:16,300
COME ON.

1387
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:18,534
* I LOOK IN YOUR EYES

1388
01:18:18,601 --> 01:18:20,767
* AND REALIZE

1389
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:24,267
* THEY CAN TELL ME MORE

1390
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:28,234
* EYES CAN BE SINCERE
AND TRUTHFUL *

1391
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,434
* LIPS CAN TELL
A LOT OF LIES *

1392
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,100
* SO I'D RATHER LISTEN

1393
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:44,100
* TO YOUR EYES

1394
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,100
MIDSHIPMAN MELVILLE, SECOND
CLASS, REPORTING, SIR.

1395
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,968
COME IN.

1396
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,267
MELVILLE... I THINK IT
WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU

1397
01:19:02,334 --> 01:19:04,067
AND FOR THE SPIRIT OF
YOUR COMPANY IN GENERAL

1398
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:06,767
IF YOU SHARED A ROOM WITH SOME
OF YOUR CLASSMATES THIS YEAR.

1399
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:08,901
YOU STAND FIRST
IN YOUR CLASS,

1400
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:10,400
YOU'VE KEPT OFF
THE REPORT,

1401
01:19:10,467 --> 01:19:12,901
BUT YOUR APTITUDE- FOR-SERVICE
RECORD IS NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF.

1402
01:19:12,968 --> 01:19:15,234
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

1403
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,901
YOU'RE NOT IN
A COLLEGE, MELVILLE.

1404
01:19:17,968 --> 01:19:20,067
THE ACADEMY IS MORE
THAN THAT.

1405
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:22,968
AT A UNIVERSITY, YOU COULD GO
YOUR OWN WAY AND DO AS YOU PLEASE.

1406
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:25,000
WITH YOUR SCHOLASTIC
RECORD, YOU'D GRADUATE,

1407
01:19:25,067 --> 01:19:26,501
PROBABLY WITH GREAT
DISTINCTION.

1408
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:28,167
THEN YOUR COLLEGE
PRESIDENT WOULD SEND FOR YOU

1409
01:19:28,234 --> 01:19:30,200
TO WISH YOU GOOD-BYE AND
GOOD LUCK. YOU'D LEAVE.

1410
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,734
THE COLLEGE WOULD CEASE
TO BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE.

1411
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:36,367
IT'S DIFFERENT HERE.

1412
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:40,767
WHEN A MIDSHIPMAN LEAVES, WE
ALWAYS SAY, "GOOD-BYE, GOOD LUCK...

1413
01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:44,267
AND I HOPE WE'LL
BE SHIPMATES SOMEDAY."

1414
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:47,434
WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS
IN YOUR CLASS?

1415
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:49,300
I HAVE NONE, SIR.

1416
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,133
WHY NOT?

1417
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,467
IT WAS MY OWN
CHOICE, SIR.

1418
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:55,734
I THOUGHT THAT, SINCE
I DIDN'T INTEND...

1419
01:19:55,801 --> 01:19:57,467
TO BE SHIPMATES
WITH MY CLASSMATES

1420
01:19:57,534 --> 01:19:59,801
THAT PERHAPS FRIENDSHIP
WASN'T NECESSARY.

1421
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:02,367
<i>WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO IN REGARD
TO THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION</i>

1422
01:20:02,434 --> 01:20:04,567
OF YOUR COMMISSION IS NOT
MY BUSINESS. IT'S YOURS.

1423
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,334
WHAT YOUR LIFE
IS HERE MUST-

1424
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,601
<i>BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF
THINGS-BE PART OF MY BUSINESS.</i>

1425
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,968
YOU'RE FAILING COMPLETELY IN
ONE THING THE ACADEMY HAS TO GIVE

1426
01:20:11,033 --> 01:20:13,334
TO A VERY GREAT
DEGREE-FRIENDSHIP.

1427
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,234
NOW, YOU'VE HAD TWO YEARS TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS ON YOUR OWN, MELVILLE.

1428
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,567
IT'S TIME YOU CHECKED ON YOUR
COMPASS AND CHARTED A NEW COURSE.

1429
01:20:21,634 --> 01:20:24,601
YOU SAY YOU HAVE
NO FRIENDS HERE.

1430
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:27,334
WHOM DO YOU TRUST
AMONGST YOUR CLASSMATES?

1431
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,434
BROWN, LINCOLN,

1432
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:31,567
EVEN TED STERLING,

1433
01:20:31,634 --> 01:20:33,567
<i>BUT THEY HAVE NO REASON
TO LIKE ME, SIR.</i>

1434
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:34,934
PERHAPS NOT.

1435
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,601
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE.

1436
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,667
THEY MAY BE YOUR
NEW ROOMMATES.

1437
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:40,934
YOU MAY GO NOW.

1438
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,634
YES, SIR.

1439
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:46,234
THIRD BATTALION, PLEASE.

1440
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,000
THIS IS CAPTAIN DOUGLAS.

1441
01:20:48,067 --> 01:20:51,601
I WANT TO SEE MIDSHIPMEN
BROWN, LINCOLN, AND STERLING.

1442
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,767
RADIO SOUNDS
MIGHTY GOOD,

1443
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,467
RIGHT OUT IN
THE OPEN LIKE THIS.

1444
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,634
Cowboy: SOUNDS BETTER THAN IT
DID IN YOUR MATTRESS, DOESN'T IT?

1445
01:21:00,701 --> 01:21:02,467
HA HA!

1446
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:04,033
YOU KNOW, DICK,

1447
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,133
<i>I HAD A RADIO IN MY
MATTRESS WHEN I WAS A PLEBE.</i>

1448
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,200
YOU DID?

1449
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,300
YEAH. SURE DID.

1450
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:12,367
HI, FELLAS. SAW
A LETTER FOR YOU.

1451
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,334
THOUGHT I'D
BRING IT OVER.

1452
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,601
I RECOGNIZED
THE HANDWRITING.

1453
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:16,400
IT'S FROM OUR GIRLFRIEND. THANKS, TED.

1454
01:21:16,467 --> 01:21:19,934
OH, ANYTHING FOR A
ROOMMATE, I ALWAYS SAYS.

1455
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:24,100
Man: HOORAY!

1456
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:38,100
OH HO! HEH!

1457
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,267
IT AIN'T PRIVATE
ENOUGH HERE.

1458
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:45,200
THEY'RE MARCHING
THROUGH THE RING, DICK.

1459
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,567
LET'S GO BACK
AND GET IN LINE.

1460
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:51,067
DARLING, I CAN'T WAIT
TO PUT THIS RING ON YOU.

1461
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,400
LET'S SKIP IT,
DO YOU MIND?

1462
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,601
I'D BE AWFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE UP THERE,

1463
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,968
REALLY I WOULD.

1464
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,434
OH, COME ON!

1465
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:03,434
I'M GOING ON MY
LAST CRUISE TOMORROW.

1466
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:06,434
LET'S DON'T WASTE TIME
WALKING THROUGH A RING.

1467
01:23:06,501 --> 01:23:09,167
I WON'T SEE YOU
FOR 3 LONG MONTHS.

1468
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,100
WHY DID YOU PUT YOUR
RING IN YOUR POCKET?

1469
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:12,767
WHY DON'T
YOU WEAR IT?

1470
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:15,100
OH, THERE ARE ABOUT
450 CLASSMATES UP THERE

1471
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:16,801
WHO WOULD RATHER
I WOULDN'T WEAR IT.

1472
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:19,400
BUT YOU WROTE ME THAT YOU WERE
MIXING WITH YOUR CLASSMATES.

1473
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:20,868
I'M TRYING TO,
BUT...

1474
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:22,901
IT'S A LITTLE
TOUGH ON THEM.

1475
01:23:22,968 --> 01:23:24,534
I GUESS I JUST
DON'T FIT.

1476
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:27,067
DARLING, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ON THE CRUISE?

1477
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:29,400
I DON'T KNOW, BUT LET'S
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

1478
01:23:29,467 --> 01:23:31,234
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS BE WITH YOU.

1479
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,934
OH, DARLING!

1480
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,901
Officer: I'M LOOKING
FOR MELVILLE.

1481
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:37,901
YES, SIR.

1482
01:23:37,968 --> 01:23:39,901
I WANT BROWN,
LINCOLN, AND STERLING.

1483
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:42,300
YES, SIR. BROWN, LINCOLN, STERLING!

1484
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,434
HAVE YOU GOT ALL THE GEAR
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE HERE?

1485
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:47,601
YES, SIR.

1486
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:48,934
ALL RIGHT,
SIGN UP ON THIS LIST.

1487
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,167
YES, SIR.

1488
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:58,434
OH, I WAS SCARED. I THOUGHT
I WASN'T GOING TO FIND YOU.

1489
01:23:58,501 --> 01:24:00,234
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

1490
01:24:01,634 --> 01:24:05,100
OH, DICK, I HAVE SUCH A
STRANGE FEELING IN MY HEART.

1491
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,100
MINE ISN'T EXACTLY
JUMPING FOR JOY.

1492
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,434
I DON'T MEAN THAT. I
MEAN ABOUT THE CRUISE

1493
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:11,567
AND WHAT IT'S GOING
TO MEAN TO YOU.

1494
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:13,901
IT JUST MEANS THAT
I'M TRADING THIS JAIL

1495
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:15,567
FOR A FLOATING ONE,
THAT'S ALL.

1496
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,868
YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND
TO HATE IT, HAVEN'T YOU?

1497
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:21,901
NO. IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ONE
LONG, LOVELY YACHTING TRIP.

1498
01:24:21,968 --> 01:24:25,067
HAVE YOU SAID GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FATHER?

1499
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:27,400
NO.

1500
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:29,601
I DON'T THINK
HE EXPECTED IT.

1501
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,234
YOUR SON LEADS HIS CLASS
AGAIN THIS YEAR, SIR.

1502
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,901
CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

1503
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:39,901
I KNOW WHERE HE STANDS, EVEN
THOUGH IT'S NOT ALL ON THE RECORD.

1504
01:24:39,968 --> 01:24:41,868
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU KNOW, DOUGLAS.

1505
01:24:41,934 --> 01:24:43,868
PERHAPS HE'LL GET HIS
BEARINGS ON THIS CRUISE.

1506
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,901
HE'LL HAVE A CHANCE
TO FIND HIMSELF.

1507
01:24:45,968 --> 01:24:48,901
THIS CRUISE IS GOING TO
MAKE OR BREAK THAT BOY.

1508
01:24:48,968 --> 01:24:52,300
THIS IS HIS LAST CHANCE
TO PROVE HIS COURSE.

1509
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:54,934
AM I ALL YOU'VE GOT TO
SAY GOOD-BYE TO, DICK?

1510
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,067
LET'S JUST MAKE IT
"YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT."

1511
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:58,334
THAT COVERS EVERYTHING.

1512
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,534
Sparks: WELL! IF IT ISN'T
LITTLE JUNE AND BIG RICHARD.

1513
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:01,634
Cowboy: MIND IF
WE CRASH HERE?

1514
01:25:01,701 --> 01:25:02,734
WHY, SURE I'D-

1515
01:25:02,801 --> 01:25:05,100
YOU SEE, MY FOLKS ARE
ARKANSAS HILLBILLIES,

1516
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:07,734
AND HIS FOLKS HAD TO MILK
THE STEERS IN ARIZONA.

1517
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:09,100
WHOA, YOU
DARN FOOL.

1518
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:10,601
YOU CAN'T
MILK A STEER.

1519
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,601
YOU OUGHT TO
COME TO ARKANSAS.

1520
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:15,434
WE CROSS OUR STEERS WITH
GOATS, AND THEY MILK FINE.

1521
01:25:16,968 --> 01:25:18,434
WHAT SPARKY'S
TRYING TO SAY IS

1522
01:25:18,501 --> 01:25:20,067
THAT SINCE
WE FELLAS HAVE

1523
01:25:20,133 --> 01:25:22,968
NO FOLKS OF OUR OWN HERE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO US,

1524
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:26,601
WE MIGHT AS WELL SAY
GOOD-BYE TO EACH OTHER.

1525
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,133
OH, I SEE.

1526
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,467
WELL, I-AH-GUESS
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

1527
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:33,467
YEAH, I-I GUESS
WE MIGHT AS WELL

1528
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,634
GET DOWN TO THIS KISSING
BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.

1529
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:36,801
HOW'S ABOUT IT,
SWEETIE?

1530
01:25:36,868 --> 01:25:39,267
READY AND WAITING, SIR.

1531
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:42,934
LOOKS LIKE WE CAN'T DO IT
IN PRIVATE THIS TIME, KID.

1532
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,968
KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE THAT, COWBOY.

1533
01:25:45,033 --> 01:25:48,467
WELL, LET'S GET
AT IT THEN, HUH?

1534
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:51,133
WELL, I GUESS
WE MIGHT AS WELL.

1535
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,367
I FEEL AWFULLY
EMPTY, DICK.

1536
01:25:55,434 --> 01:25:58,300
I'LL BE BACK
IN 3 MONTHS.

1537
01:25:58,367 --> 01:26:00,467
WILL YOU BE
DIFFERENT THEN?

1538
01:26:00,534 --> 01:26:02,067
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE?

1539
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:06,133
IN A WAY I MEAN YES,
WITH ALL MY HEART.

1540
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,501
<i>I'M-
I WAS A NAVY GIRL.</i>

1541
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:15,434
I'VE SAID GOOD-BYE LIKE
THIS TO DAD, JIMMY...

1542
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:16,968
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH YOU.

1543
01:26:17,033 --> 01:26:20,601
BUT NAVY WAS THEIR
LIFE, DARLING.

1544
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:23,767
DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

1545
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:25,601
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT I MEAN.

1546
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:28,167
<i>MAYBE I WANT NAVY TO BE YOUR LIFE.</i>

1547
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:31,467
GOOD-BYE, DARLING.

1548
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:32,801
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.

1549
01:26:33,634 --> 01:26:34,934
GOOD-BYE.

1550
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,334
All, shouting:
NAAAVY!

1551
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:40,801
NAAAVY!

1552
01:27:40,868 --> 01:27:42,467

SWEETHEART!

1558
01:28:41,501 --> 01:28:44,133
BROTHERS, THE OPEN
SEA HAS GOT ME.

1559
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,100
IT'S SHIPBOARD,
NOT CLASSROOMS.

1560
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:48,801
THE WIDE OPEN SEA.

1561
01:28:49,901 --> 01:28:51,467
Sparks:
NOT GRAY WALLS.

1562
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:55,267
NO BOOMING THE BOOKS

1563
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:56,834
PIPE DOWN, YOU!

1564
01:28:56,901 --> 01:29:00,634
All: COXSWAIN!
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

1565
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:01,934

01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:12,968
BECAUSE YOU

1571
01:29:13,033 --> 01:29:14,133
Together: WHERE?

1572
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,901
I'M IN THE OLD
BOILER ROOM,

1573
01:29:15,968 --> 01:29:18,434
RIGHT DOWN IN THE STEAM
THAT I BILGED OUT ON.

1574
01:29:18,501 --> 01:29:20,934
ASK ME SOMETHING ABOUT A DOUBLE
REDUCTION GEARED TURBINE, I DARE YOU!

1575
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,434
BOY, I'LL BE A
FIRST CLASSMAN

1576
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:23,767
WHEN YOU START IN AS A PLEBE AGAIN.

1577
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:24,934
COXSWAIN, YOU MAKE

1578
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,434
AND WE'LL BE
ENSIGNS TOGETHER.

1580
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:29,934
HE'S RIGHT

1581
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,634
Coxswain: I WANT TO TALK TO DICK.

1582
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,434
HELLO, DICK.

1583
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:36,901
HEY. HELLO, COXSWAIN.

1585
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:39,434
UH-HUH.

01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:40,934
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU.

1587
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,167
THANKS. NICE
TO SEE YOU.

1588
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:44,701
SAY, DICK... SOMETHING
I WANT TO SAY TO YOU.

1589
01:29:45,934 --> 01:29:47,734
I REMEMBER ONCE YOU
HAD A LOT TO SAY TO ME.

1590
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:49,968
THAT'S JUST IT.
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN

1591
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:51,434
HOW I BLEW UP
MY LAST DAY.

1592
01:29:51,501 --> 01:29:52,467
OH.

1593
01:29:52,534 --> 01:29:53,801
OH, YOU MEANT
ALL RIGHT.

1594
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:55,300
I KIND OF
SHOT OFF MY MOUTH,

1595
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:56,701
BUT I WAS SORRY
ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS.

1596
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:57,968
FORGET ABOUT IT.

1597
01:29:58,033 --> 01:29:58,968
SHALL WE?

1598
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:01,434
SURE, FORGET IT.

1599
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:03,467
GEE, THAT WAS
AN AWFUL BAD DAY.

1600
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:04,968
EVERYTHING'S SWELL NOW.

1601
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,868
I'M STARTING BACK AT
THE ACADEMY NEXT TERM.

1602
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:07,968
YOU ARE?

1603
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:09,300
YEAH.

1604
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:11,367
HEY, THAT'S GREAT. I KNOW
HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO YOU.

1605
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:19,567
I
- I HOPE WE'LL STAND ON WATCH TOGETHER SOMEDAY.

1606
01:30:20,968 --> 01:30:23,467
THANKS, COXSWAIN.

1607
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,400
DICKY.

1608
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:45,267
WHERE'S YOUR CLASS RING?
LOSE IT?

1609
01:30:45,334 --> 01:30:47,434
NO. I'VE GOT IT,
SPARKS.

1610
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:50,100
BOY, I WOULDN'T GO
TO SLEEP WITHOUT MINE ON.

1611
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:52,200
WHAT ARE YOU SAVING IT FOR,
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN?

1612
01:30:52,267 --> 01:30:54,434
I SURE LOADED ENOUGH
DUMMY SHELLS TODAY.

1613
01:30:54,501 --> 01:30:55,934
THAT'LL KEEP
YOU FROM BEING

1614
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,934
A DUMMY WHEN WE REALLY
GET STARTED SHOOTING.

1615
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,200
HOW ABOUT
A SONG, DICK?

1616
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:02,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD YOU SING
SINCE WE WERE PLEBES.

1617
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:03,234
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LOST YOUR VOICE?

1618
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,467
COME ON, DICK.

1619
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:05,968
SING SOMETHING
FOR US, WILL YOU?

1620
01:31:06,033 --> 01:31:08,300
NO, YOU FELLOWS GO
AHEAD AND SING A SONG.

1621
01:31:08,367 --> 01:31:10,968
THAT HEAT HAS KIND OF
WARPED MY VOCAL CORDS.

1622
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:12,434
Sparks: HEY, DENNY.

1623
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:16,200
DRAG OUT AND DUST OFF THAT
NAVY SONG DICK GAVE BIRTH TO.

1624
