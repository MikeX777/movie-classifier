00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,707
The job flier says they hang out
in that old fortress at the top!

2
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,668
You're sure excited about this.

3
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,378
I sure am!

4
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,881
I'm just brimming with
confidence for some reason lately!

5
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,884
All right! We got a job to do! Let's go, Happy!

6
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,511

The Bacchus Bandits!
We're supposed to catch Geese, their leader!

29
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,078
The mayor himself posted this job,
so it's gonna be a <i>huge </i>reward!

30
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:32,248
Lucy. You got a crazy, greedy
look on your face, you know.

31
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,541
How rude!

32
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,794
Just stay focused, Happy!

33
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,836
Ms. Erza!

34
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,755
Yes, Wendy?

35
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,925
Is it me, or does the city seem <i>too </i>quiet?

36
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,936
An ambush, huh?

37
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,980
You guys ain't gettin' past us!

38
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,484
We're gonna turn ya into fish
food and knock you into the ocean!

39
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,695
Sounds great! I'm fired up now!

40
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,781
Our only target is Geese, their leader!

41
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,784
We won't get our reward
unless we find and capture him!

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,036
I want the reward! Really want it!

43
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,455
--Reward! Reward!
--Yup, she's turned evil.

44
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,749
Get 'em!

45
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,917
Scatter!

46
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,467
Why are you following us?
<i>Natsu's </i>your partner!

47
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,804
Because I gotta protect you and all.

48
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,389
Want a fish?

49
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
Mind your own business!

50
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,435
And this is no time to talk about fish!

51
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,645
Here goes! Charle! Happy!

53
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,116
That's so mean, Wendy...!

54
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,660
Sorry...

55
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,454
Get back here!

56
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,000
Fish food, huh?

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,711
Well, <i>I'm </i>gonna grill <i>you </i>like fish!

58
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,546
Fire Dragon...

59
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,219
...Roar!

60
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,103
So mean...

61
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,147
Sorry, Happy!

62
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,694
Hand over Geese! I've no business with you!

63
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,906
You really think we'll give
you our boss just like that?!

64
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,618
I like you. You're chivalrous.

65
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,996
In that case... I assume
you've prepared yourselves!

66
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,878
What the heck?!

67
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,505
Charge!

68
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,559
Now, then. Tell me where Geese--

69
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,437
Drat. I guess I overdid things...

70
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,071
Here we are!

71
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,995
Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

72
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,626
So...

73
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,920
Where's Geese, your boss?

74
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,171
Don't get naked!

75
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,506
Lance!

76
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,720
Man, they just keep comin'!

77
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,805
Ice Make: Floor!

78
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,937
So, where can I find Geese...?

79
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,063
Oh!

80
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,735
Ka-clink!

81
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,446
Hey! What's the big idea, Gray?!

82
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,072
--Hot!
--What are <i>you </i>doing?!

83
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,491
--Don't send him back here!
--You're bugging me!

84
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,244
Hot! Cold! Hot! Cold!

85
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,996
That's enough!

86
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,080
Yes, Ma'am!

87
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,290
Hot!

88
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,629
Huh?!

89
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,591
That's his punishment for charring me like that!

90
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,217
He's such a lost cause.

91
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,888
Now tell me where Geese is!

92
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,098
Or else you'll be in for a world of hurt!

93
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,975
Moo!

94
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,562
Even though she's in a real pinch,
Ms. Lucy's high-handed nice body...

95
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,481
...is the greatest!

96
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,109
Uhh, Taurus. How am I supposed
to question them like that?!

97
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,738
--You can leave now.
--No mooore?!

98
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,116
Let's try that again! Open, Gate of the Lion!

99
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,909
Loke!

100
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,870
Okay, Lucy. Just leave this to me.

101
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,289
Regulus Gatling Impact!

102
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,751
Not you, too...

103
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,588
Oh, don't be like that, Lucy.

104
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,217
If you want to beat info out of
someone, one person is all you need.

105
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,259
You know?

106
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,687
Happy... Help...

107
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,817
Can't you do something about that
crazy motion sickness of yours?

108
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,864
There he is!

109
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,534
Talk about obvious!

110
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,660
I got this!

111
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,122
--Lucy?!
--Man, she's excited, all right!

112
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,548
Get back here!

113
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,179
Yes! A dead-end! The reward's as good as ours!

114
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,389
Nope!

115
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
Huh?!

116
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,729
No way...!

117
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,904
Wait! Our reward...!

118
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,825
I can't believe this!

119
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,246
You not only wrecked the town,
but let Geese get away as well?!

120
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,915
Yes. It's my fault.

121
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,336
We're deeply sorry, Mayor.
But the bandits <i>have </i>been routed...

122
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,254
Don't give me your excuses!

123
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,214
How can you call yourselves "Fairy Tail"?!

124
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,885
Do some actual work instead of calling
yourself some self-important name!

125
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,470
You get no reward!

126
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,184
I'm sorry, everyone. It's my fault.

127
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,019
It's okay!

128
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,896
We're in this together.

129
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh! That's a cool thing to say, Natsu!

130
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,611
The point is, the master is
going to be mad at <i>all </i>of us.

131
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,154
Charle...

132
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,740
Shall we head back?

133
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,269
I almost didn't think you
were going to come back.

134
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,607
I'm sorry...

135
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,152
You promised you would stay
with me forever, didn't you?

136
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,699
Abnormal magic was detected
in the mountains north of Fiore.

137
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,826
The cause is under investigation,

138
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:28,998
but we've also received reports that
it has obliterated two whole mountains.

139
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:34,170
Moreover, we have reason to believe that this
was only a small fraction of its full power.

140
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,800
In other words, its power
rivals even that of Zeref.

141
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,888
--We don't know that for sure yet.
--Rivals Zeref...

142
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:49,436
But, if this power could result
in the world's destruction...!

143
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,272
At any rate, we cannot overlook it.

144
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:57,902
That is why I've asked you masters here--
to exchange ideas and opinions.

145
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,868
Those big shots certainly are long-winded...

146
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,454
I leave it in your hands.

147
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,306
Buy one and I'll give you another for free!

148
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,893
All right! We're back!

149
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,729
It sure is nice to be in Magnolia!

150
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,730
Sorry!

151
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,983
I'm gonna take a shower at
home before I go to the guild!

152
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,361
See you in a bit!

153
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,571
She's clearly feigning her cheerfulness.

154
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,073
Ms. Lucy...

155
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,078
Don't worry about it.
She's always been quick to recover.

156
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,794
We're back!

157
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,839
Cheers!

158
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,099
Yo, Natsu!

159
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,934
How'd it go?

160
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,437
A total failure! And zero reward at all!

161
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,690
Welcome back, my dear Gray!

162
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,108
Hi, Juvia.

163
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:23,363
Oh! This guild without you
was like a sea without water!

164
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,074
And my romantic rival isn't
<i>anywhere </i>to be seen...

165
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,159
What are you muttering about?

166
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,122
They say talkin' to yourself's
a sign of old age, you know.

167
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,541
O-Old age...

168
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,292
Where's Master?

169
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,421
The Council called for him.

170
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,339
He said he's gonna be gone a while.

171
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,507
I see.

172
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,140
All right! I'll do better next time!

173
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,398
Eclair! Eclair!

174
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,067
Hey! Are you all right?!

175
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,029
Please! Help Eclair!

176
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,758
So, you see...

177
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:29,888
If I pair the other Phoenix Stone with
the one passed down in my family,

178
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,850
an extraordinary miracle will occur!

179
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,188
And I've <i>finally </i>found the girl with the stone.

180
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,776
The 400th anniversary of the founding of
the Principality of Veronica is coming up.

181
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,361
As such,

182
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:50,325
I wish to put the two stones together at
the celebration, in front of the people!

183
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,537
So that I'll look absolutely
striking and splendid to all!

184
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:58,500
How can we serve you, Duke Cream?

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,589
I want you, the Carbuncle guild,
to bring me the other stone.

186
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,883
You will be handsomely rewarded.

187
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,427
Adding in your security services
during the anniversary celebration,

188
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,013
I'll pay you 400 million Jewel.

189
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,604
400 million...

190
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,943
So all we basically have to do is catch
the girl with the other stone, right?

191
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,154
400 million Jewel for such a simple job!

192
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,990
It's hilarious.

193
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,200
Chase.

194
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,498
A Phoenix Stone, huh...

195
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,086
In the name of Carbuncle,

196
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,132
the glittering garnet on the forehead of the
beast that lurks in the darkness of night...

197
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,092
...we shall accomplish this job.

198
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,291
Here you are.

199
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,208
Thanks...

200
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,170
Was she just hungry, maybe?

201
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,296
Who is she?

202
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,048
I dunno.

203
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,966
What's that baby bird-looking thing?

204
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,427
Seems to be her friend...

205
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,221
--Looks kinda tasty!
--Oh, geez.

206
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,808
Thank you for the meal.

207
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,270
You'll be okay now!

208
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,482
No, I would've been fine
with or without your food.

209
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,566
Huh?

210
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,193
Oh, my.

211
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:52,280
Eclair! Don't say things like that!

212
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,573
I'm sorry!

213
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,409
N-No, it's okay...

214
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,744
I'm Momon.

215
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,454
She's Eclair.

216
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,332
I took her in a few years ago!

217
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,250
Don't you mean the opposite?!

218
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,632
I'm Lucy! Nice to meet you!

219
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,394
I'm Natsu! I'm a Dragon Slayer!

220
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,145
Nice to meetcha, Eclair!

221
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,438
I'm Happy!

222
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,191
Want some fish?

223
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,776
Thanks for your help.

224
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,446
Let's go, Momon.

225
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,378
--Wait!
--Charle?

226
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,965
The forest you're headed for is dangerous!

227
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,175
Something sad is waiting there...

228
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,427
Forest?

229
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,223
The Boundary Forest...

230
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,977
Yes... Deep inside the Boundary Forest...

231
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,186
That's where...

232
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,647
Boundary Forest...

233
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,317
Let's go, Momon.

234
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,194
E-Eclair?

235
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,612
Hey!

236
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,249
Hold on a minute!

237
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,293
Where are you going?

238
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,878
The Boundary Forest.

239
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:35,091
I hear that place is filled
with monsters! It's dangerous!

240
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,593
I have to go there.

241
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,011
Why?!

242
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,139
I don't know...

243
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,601
I don't know why. But I have to go there.

244
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,192
We'll protect you, then!

245
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,943
We <i>are </i>wizards and all!

246
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,740
I don't like magic, actually...

247
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,576
--Huh?
--Eclair!

248
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:05,622
Magic sometimes brings sorrow with it.

249
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,625
Magic... brings sorrow?

250
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,296
That's not true!

251
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,298
I'm coming with you!

252
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,552
Me too! I'm gonna make
you say that you love magic!

253
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,762
Aye!

254
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,806
We'll accompany you as well.

255
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,350
Got nothin' else planned, anyways.

256
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,769
Guys!

257
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,030
Hey, let's have them come with us!

258
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,498
Still as bad as always...!

259
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,376
Wendy. Your motion sickness spell...

260
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:55,505
I'm not supposed to, since using it
all the time will make it stop working.

261
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,175
Just bear it until we reach
the Rose Garden way station.

262
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,137
I hate my body...

263
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,352
Say, where are you from, Eclair?

264
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,229
I don't remember.

265
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,440
I seem to be missing part of my memory.

266
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,401
Huh? You mean like amnesia?!

267
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,862
Only partially.

268
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,197
I do remember some things, though.

269
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,827
Like that I don't like wizards.
Especially nosy ones.

270
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,830
Don't be like that, Eclair!

271
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,877
I'm sorry. Eclair's just not very sociable.
She's a good person at heart.

272
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,545
Pointless chatter.

273
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,339
If you say so...

274
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,862
This is awesome!

275
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,406
The whole town's brimming with magic!

276
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,241
Wow!

277
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,493
Happy!

278
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,661
--Let's eat first!
--Aye, Sir!

279
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,622
Food! Food!

280
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,248
That idiot...

281
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,249
Well, then.

282
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:18,505
Let us check in to our hotel and
do as we please until tonight.

283
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,430
Your room keys, yes? Just a moment, please.

284
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,431
Certainly.

285
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,767
What's Erza so happy about?

286
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:21,438
Apparently she bought
a wedding dress at a store.

287
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,772
Huh?!

288
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,316
--What's wrong?
--Oh, nothing...!

289
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,545
What's with her, I wonder?

290
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,517
You're not going to shower?

291
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,065
Eclair...

292
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,232
Say...

293
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:11,029
I can switch rooms if you don't
want to share one with me...

294
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,948
--I don't mind sharing it.
--Huh?

295
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,661
You have the same look in your eyes as me.

296
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,372
What are you talking about?

297
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:25,085
You have the eyes...
of someone who knows human sorrow.

298
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:30,715
I didn't know there were
magic users with those eyes too.

299
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,135
Human... sorrow...?

300
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,229
Momon!

301
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:52,278
The comfort of being a captive,
or the terror of being fleeing prey...

302
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,073
--Choose.
--Wh-Who are you?!

303
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,825
Not you.

304
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,909
Huh?!

305
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,246
Run, Eclair!

306
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,834
Eclair!

307
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,711
Natsu!

308
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,763
Someone's out to get you?!

309
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,806
Above!

310
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,831
Eclair! Lucy! Are you okay?!

311
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,632
Let her blood flow, blade of mine.

312
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,553
Eclair!

313
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,065
Natsu! Gray! Happy!

314
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,816
Who are you?!

315
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,324
You aren't worthy enough to know my name.

316
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,951
Wait!

317
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,496
--Happy! Stay with Lucy!
--Aye, Sir!

318
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,552
C'mon...!

319
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,150
Bastard...!

320
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,736
O starving claws...

321
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:57,737
Feed!

322
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,955
--Damn!
--You're not gettin' away!

323
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,053
So you waited, huh?

324
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,597
Fairy... Tail...

325
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,440
He vanished...

326
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,738
Huh? So you have no idea what's going on?

327
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,239
Can you remember anything?

328
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,907
Hey!

329
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,034
You okay?!

330
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,410
What happened?

331
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,746
Someone's out to get her!

332
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:48,955
Oh...

333
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,457
What?

334
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,084
Umm, Lucy.

335
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,711
You're arousing.

336
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,344
Is your stripping habit contagious or something?

337
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,763
Th-Thank you, stripping habit of mine.

338
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,556
Look the other way!

339
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:22,030
Visit the wizard Kalard in the Boundary Forest.

340
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:27,369
And then deliver this stone to him.

341
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,874
I think this stone is why I'm being targeted.

342
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,417
This stone?

343
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,420
I do sense unusual power from it.

344
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,299
I've never heard of this wizard named Kalard.

345
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,177
What <i>is </i>that stone, Eclair?

346
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:47,097
Eclair says she doesn't know either.

347
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,350
But she's had it for as long as she can remember.

348
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,104
I have no memory of how things started.

349
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:58,441
I don't know where I'm from, who I am,

350
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:02,028
or what I'm living for...

351
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:07,117
But I've started to remember
things little by little recently.

352
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,995
I'm sure this stone is a clue to it all.

353
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,124
Won't we find out if we meet this Kalard guy?

354
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:17,961
You know where Kalard lives, right?

355
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:23,717
I do, although I can't remember who Kalard is.

356
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,302
Even if it's too late to see him, I have to go there.

357
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,646
Take this!

358
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,988
Are you not going to do anything?

359
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,448
Err, well...

360
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,242
Let's catch some fish and perk up...

361
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,540
--Oh, a yummy-looking one!
--Get real!

362
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,917
Open, Gate of the Water Bearer!

363
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,085
Aquarius!

364
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,880
All right, you!

365
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,548
Chew on <i>this</i>!

366
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:10,055
Don't go summonin' me with nasty water!

367
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,181
You okay, Lucy?

368
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,099
Not really...

369
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,287
This is a monster-deterrent barrier.

370
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,039
It's quite worn-out, though...

371
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,874
Then we're almost there?

372
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:52,931
T-Talk about run-down!

373
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,183
This is Kalard's house?

374
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,402
It sure is an old house.

375
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,569
More like ruins.

376
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:07,570
Sheesh...

377
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,571
Hey.

378
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,016
This is a remarkable workshop.

379
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:40,979
What is it?

380
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,568
This is...

381
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,574
...me, as a child.

382
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,616
Huh?!

383
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,076
Does that mean...?

384
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,584
Eclair! Get back!

385
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,628
Eclair...

386
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,090
Eclair.

387
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:15,221
If you are seeing this, then it means it's true.

388
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,308
People looking for you came here,

389
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:22,270
and survivors of Fire Village
told me what happened as well.

390
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,941
I am happy that you have survived.

391
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:30,612
But, when I think about your fate...

392
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,033
This is Kalard?

393
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,493
Eclair...

394
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:42,665
My time with you was my greatest joy in life.

395
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:47,337
But Fire Village needed you as a priestess,

396
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:51,508
and I had the task of
Dispelling the Phoenix Stones...

397
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,678
Dispel... Nullification magic.

398
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:59,432
I'm sure you were a splendid priestess.

399
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,480
I've completed the Dispel magic.

400
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,566
But I doubt I'll ever be able to use it...

401
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,197
I've fallen ill.

402
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:19,619
I haven't nearly enough life to hang
on to until you arrive with the stone.

403
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,205
I'm sorry...

404
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,206
Eclair...

405
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,292
You mean he's already...?

406
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,713
I pray from the bottom of my heart...

407
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:35,218
At the very least, I hope you
will find wonderful friends...

408
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,220
Eclair...

409
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,723
My beloved daughter...

410
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,600
Father?

411
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:03,079
No luck.

412
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,372
We searched everywhere,

413
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,709
but Kalard didn't leave behind
<i>any </i>notes about his Dispel magic.

414
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,127
I see...

415
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,592
The real issue is the spell
cast on that Phoenix Stone.

416
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:27,103
The wizard Kalard spent his entire
life trying to remove that spell...

417
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:31,024
I can only imagine it's something ill-omened.

418
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:02,305
I lost my father recently too.

419
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:04,808
I wasn't able to be by his side...

420
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,858
"I hope you will find wonderful friends..."

421
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,403
Those are lovely final words.

422
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,363
Wonderful friends...

423
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:23,827
I want to be your friend!

424
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:43,805
I'd like to make a formal request of Fairy Tail.

425
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:47,225
My father spent his entire life
trying to Dispel the Phoenix Stones.

426
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,269
I want your help to do it.

427
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,812
We accept.

428
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,273
--You can count on us!
--Aye!

429
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,234
Thank you.

430
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:03,324
At the loss of many, we have sealed the Phoenix.

431
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:07,287
The two Phoenix Stones
are testament to that fact.

432
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,789
It is because of them we have true peace.

433
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,378
Doesn't look dangerous to me...

434
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,423
Why don't we just break it?

435
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,884
Good thinking, Happy!

436
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,433
Fire Dragon... Wing Attack!

437
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:33,521
Why don't you ever think things through?!

438
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,523
This is one tough rock...

439
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:40,236
If it were easy to break,
Kalard wouldn't have struggled with it!

440
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,613
Man...

441
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:48,745
Incidentally, whatever happened
to the other Phoenix Stone?

442
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:52,332
It was stolen... I think.

443
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,418
The day of the raid...

444
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,671
Vero... nica...?

445
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,255
I've heard of that!

446
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:02,801
Veronica's a small country to the north of Fiore!

447
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,535
Who are you guys?!

448
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:35,750
We are Carbuncle: the garnet-adorned
beast that lurks in the darkness.

449
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,794
<i>My </i>name is Dist.

450
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,297
Natsu!

451
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:47,554
--Mr. Natsu!
--Stay down!

452
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,014
Bastard!

453
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,643
Hey, pretty boy.

454
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,396
Looks like <i>you </i>got a date
with me, the great Cannon.

455
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,772
What?!

456
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,819
This brute has professed
his love for my dear Gray?!

457
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,822
Could you please stop batting
your eyelashes at my dear Gray?!

458
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,908
Huh? I ain't doing that...

459
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,828
You lie!

460
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:18,084
Juvia is water. Those won't work on her.

461
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,257
Magic bullets?!

462
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,474
This calls for a <i>real </i>man!

463
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,399
What shabby Take Overs.

464
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,777
--Look after Eclair!
--Got it!

465
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:44,986
Enough of this!

466
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:55,330
The Titania is but an ordinary woman
before me, the great Coordinator.

467
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,664
--No...
--Requip?!

468
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:57,957
You're less than that!

469
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,502
This is bad...

470
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,712
Jet! Go get the master!

471
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:04,422
Who's gonna protect Levy?!

472
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:06,800
I mean <i>after </i>you've gotten her to safety!

473
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,260
--Oh!
--I'm not the only--

474
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:14,974
There.

475
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,268
Eclair!

476
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,858
Lucy! Momon!

477
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,906
Eclair...

478
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,673
This beauty will soon be eternal.

479
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:52,095
Just how are you faring, Dist?

480
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,439
Eclair's been taken...

481
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,900
I couldn't do a thing about it!

482
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,861
I'm gonna go rescue her...

483
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,488
Momon. You're in no shape for that right now.

484
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:14,784
Stealing a client from Fairy Tail...

485
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:17,037
You got some guts, all right!

486
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,122
But now you're gonna pay!

487
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:23,251
Oh, my.

488
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:26,713
We've been seriously trounced, indeed...

489
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,757
Gramps! Gajeel!

490
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,050
Lily!

491
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:35,638
Please forgive me. I was unable to
hold down the fort for you, Master.

492
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:38,725
Master. Did Jet give you the news?

493
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:41,811
Jet? I haven't seen him.

494
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,898
Master!

495
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,358
I'm coming!

496
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:53,073
We were investigating some unusual
magic power at Master's behest.

497
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:57,202
And then we ran smack into
the Principality of Veronica.

498
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,621
That's what Eclair was talking about...

499
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:03,041
The guys who stole the
other Phoenix Stone, huh?

500
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,503
The ones who attacked the guild, Carbuncle,

501
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:10,840
are now the lapdogs of Duke Cream of Veronica.

502
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,803
They agreed to abduct Eclair
for a large sum of money.

503
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:18,973
Veronica celebrates its
400th anniversary tomorrow.

504
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:24,562
Duke Cream plans to put the two
Phoenix Stones together at the ceremony.

505
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:25,855
Why?

506
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:31,653
According to Veronican royal lore,
when the Phoenix Stones become one,

507
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,864
the sealed Phoenix shall be revived...

508
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:39,786
And apparently that'll give you eternal life.

509
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,746
Eternal life?

510
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:48,878
It is said countless people of Fire Village
perished sealing away the Phoenix.

511
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:52,716
Its revival would be akin to that of a demon.

512
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:55,218
If we can just Dispel one of those stones,

513
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:58,013
we can prevent the Phoenix from reviving...

514
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:01,891
That's why Kalard was waiting
for her to bring the stone.

515
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:06,062
Duke Cream plans to gain the
Phoenix's power and eternal life

516
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:08,189
to do whatever he pleases.

517
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:11,192
After all, having eternal life means he won't die

518
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:14,571
even as the Phoenix goes on a rampage.

519
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,822
Only he'll survive.

520
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,491
The hell with that...!

521
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:19,743
Master!

522
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:22,912
I'm going to rescue Eclair!

523
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,623
She was crying.

524
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:30,920
When I hugged her, she was
trembling so much that I shook too...

525
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,633
This isn't about having the stone
or the Phoenix or anything else!

526
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:39,596
She's a normal girl.

527
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:43,975
She cried when she learned her father was dead.

528
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:47,103
She's just a normal girl...

529
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:51,399
Very well. Go, Lucy.

530
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:53,943
Erza. I leave the member selection to you.

531
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:56,696
--Right.
--Take a small, elite team.

532
00:44:56,696 --> 00:45:01,201
Although it's a small country, we can't
afford to go to war with Veronica.

533
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,452
Understood.

534
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,996
Wendy. I'll need your anti-motion sickness spell.

535
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:07,082
Right! I'll come with you!

536
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,625
I'm going too.

537
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,085
Umm, so will Juvia!

538
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,419
Aye, Sir!

539
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:15,215
We must prepare for the worst possible situation.

540
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:19,344
I will hurry back to the
Council and give my report.

541
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:38,238
Hello, girl.

542
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,448
Thank you for the Phoenix Stone.

543
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:43,284
I really must repay you somehow.

544
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:46,913
You mustn't revive the Phoenix!

545
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:50,000
Controlling it is beyond our reach!

546
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,086
It's perfectly within <i>my </i>reach, though.

547
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,680
That's it, you wench!

548
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,766
I'm going to execute you tomorrow, as a sacrifice!

549
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,643
Look forward to it!

550
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,192
Detestable harlot...

551
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:19,863
They may come to retrieve her.

552
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,781
I'll have my men ready.

553
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:23,241
I leave it to you.

554
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,886
They weren't just a legend?

555
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:47,474
Indeed. The Phoenix's revival.
The capture of eternal life.

556
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:52,187
The Principality of Veronica will most
likely try to take over all of Fiore.

557
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:55,148
Absurd! A small principality wouldn't dare!

558
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,985
Then how do you explain its connection
with the unusual magic power?

559
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:01,071
Listen to what you say, Makarov.

560
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:05,075
Are you suggesting we start
a war with a small nation?

561
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,077
We haven't time to waste.

562
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:10,205
As a master, I make a request of the Council!

563
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:13,917
In accordance with Article 27 of
the National Security Directive,

564
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,336
I ask you to issue a threat elimination order

565
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:19,464
so as to secure the citizens' lives and property.

566
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:22,425
You <i>must </i>vote to prevent the Phoenix's revival.

567
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,968
You overspeak your bounds!

568
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:27,305
W-We need to examine all the information first...

569
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:30,100
I told you, there is no time!

570
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:51,246
Lousy outsiders, currying favor with His Grace...

571
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:54,290
By the blood of antiquity, I order thee.

572
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,334
Stagger forth.

573
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:58,294
Open, sesame.

574
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,774
We're coming, Eclair.

575
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:49,179
Eclair. You are still young.

576
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,556
You mustn't die...

577
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,367
So that's it...

578
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,368
Hey.

579
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,537
Now I see...

580
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:18,208
This is my...

581
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:22,629
I've returned...

582
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,675
It's finally going to happen.

583
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:34,224
Who's there?! Gate's closed for today!

584
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,851
We're Fairy Tail, dammit!

585
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,938
We don't want any lip from you!

586
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,571
Once we're inside, focus
entirely on rescuing Eclair!

587
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:51,074
All right!

588
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:57,914
Your Grace...

589
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,582
There's nothing to worry about.

590
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:03,044
My lovely lapdogs will do all the howling for us.

591
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:16,182
You...!

592
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,571
You, huh?!

593
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:32,866
I was meaning to tell you
something if I saw you again.

594
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,075
What is it?!

595
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:36,619
Your taste in clothing is bad.

596
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,371
<i>Very </i>bad.

597
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,123
What a coincidence.

598
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:42,625
I was going to say the same...

599
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,587
...to you!

600
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:59,267
I thought we could fool the guards into
thinking we're a bunch of girls and cats...

601
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,811
...but this is a Carbuncle squad.

602
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,732
--Scared?
--No.

603
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:11,780
I just realized that fighting isn't
scary if it's for someone's sake!

604
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,367
Wendy and I will hold them off.

605
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,660
You hurry ahead, Lucy.

606
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,579
Thanks.

607
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:20,622
Let's do it!

608
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,725
The castle is northwest...

609
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:52,362
Don't you have anything tastier?

610
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,366
Hurry, Juvia!

611
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:57,701
Right!

612
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:03,248
Despite the situation, Juvia is so
happy to be with wonderful Gray!

613
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,457
--Get down!
--Oh!

614
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:09,254
You!

615
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,964
You're so bold, my dear Gray!

616
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,134
Pretty boy! Let's play some more!

617
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:19,723
Anyone who messes with Gray--even a meatball
like you--will have to answer to Juvia!

618
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,182
You romantic rival!

619
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:22,267
Calm down!

620
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:26,354
Wait! Why are you taking your
clothes off in front of that man?!

621
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:27,897
A lover's quarrel?!

622
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:32,235
Slicer!

623
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:36,865
Shatter to pieces!

624
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,160
Right in the middle of town!

625
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,457
Fireworks?

626
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:48,668
Eclair...

627
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:49,711
Please be okay!

628
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,546
Halt, you!

629
00:52:51,546 --> 00:52:54,132
Open, Gate of the Maiden!

630
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:55,383
Virgo!

631
00:52:56,384 --> 00:53:00,180
Do you wish to punish me for
interrupting the celebration, Princess?

632
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,182
Just take care of them!

633
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:03,308
Certainly.

634
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,195
Got you!

635
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:22,285
Princess. Please hurry.

636
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:23,495
Thanks!

637
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,873
Please take care.

638
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,392
I... had a lot of fun... being with Eclair...

639
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,185
Momon...

640
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,483
So I have to pay her back... for all the fun I had...

641
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:56,653
I <i>will </i>save Eclair!

642
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,947
Let me through!

643
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,284
Wh-Why, you...!

644
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:05,787
Momon...

645
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:10,917
Just how many weaklings do you have to hurt...

646
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,336
...until you're satisfied?!

647
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:17,298
It's time to grant you death, Salamander.

648
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,012
Natsu...

649
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:35,483
You don't have what it takes
to make this garnet shine.

650
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:42,323
Undo!

651
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,415
Give it up.

652
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:58,590
Oh, how cute. Some sort of country girl?

653
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,217
So <i>this </i>is what you're into?

654
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:02,385
Funny!

655
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:20,987
Oh, this is the theater.

656
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:27,118
She can undo my Requips
because my mind isn't firm enough.

657
00:55:28,244 --> 00:55:30,622
I must possess unwavering resoluteness!

658
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,417
You don't have what it takes.

659
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:41,508
I think it's time for the finale.

660
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:49,891
All right. Come on out.

661
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:59,234
Oh? Pretty boy's finished his bath?

662
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:09,369
You wrecked our guild...

663
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:12,288
Now it's payback time!

664
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,415
Bring it on!

665
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,874
Cold...

666
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,877
...Excalibur!

667
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:25,385
Why, you...!

668
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:35,687
Let's go, Juvia.

669
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:36,938
Yes!

670
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:41,985
O bride.

671
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:46,448
Henceforth you will belongeth to me, the Phoenix.

672
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,284
I am undeserving of such honor.

673
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:55,165
Why does thou hesitate
to wed thy glorious ruler?

674
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,012
Oh, what fitting timing.

675
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:20,357
"Why does thou hesitate to
wed thy glorious ruler?!" was it?

676
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:21,566
I see.

677
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:30,950
Have at you!

678
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,829
I shall slice the wedding cake
that goes by your name!

679
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:37,332
What kind of line is that?

680
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:42,587
What? I can't undo her Requip?!

681
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:43,672
Impossible!

682
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:46,091
Don't underestimate a bride!

683
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:00,647
Your bride form wouldn't come undone...

684
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:05,694
Just how badly do you want to... get married...?

685
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,862
Wha...?! I-It's not like that!

686
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:18,498
I lurk far and wide within
the darkness, just as sins do.

687
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,759
You...!

688
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:36,474
All too easy.

689
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:45,775
The great Black Steel Gajeel's
innards are hard too, you know!

690
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:55,827
I dunno which shadow's the real deal,

691
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:59,581
so I'll just tear 'em <i>all </i>up!

692
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,808
Happy... Are you up for it?

693
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:22,228
I'm okay... I can fly...

694
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:23,813
Do it, then...

695
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:24,939
Aye...

696
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,695
Eclair... Lucy!

697
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:35,033
Everyone! Let us all celebrate!

698
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:39,496
I now possess the two Phoenix Stones!

699
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:43,166
Stop! You mustn't put the stones together!

700
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,752
Annoying girl.

701
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:46,753
Your Grace...

702
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,673
Oh, you're just in time.

703
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,925
Now then, let's begin

704
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:58,098
the Phoenix revival ceremony that will
grant Veronica tremendous power!

705
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:00,934
You mustn't revive the Phoenix!

706
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:03,228
O fundamental consociate...

707
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,772
O wandering counterpart...

708
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,025
Assemble before me!

709
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,152
I don't care what happens to me!

710
01:00:11,152 --> 01:00:14,364
Just don't put the Phoenix Stones together!

711
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:22,706
No!

712
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,459
Eclair!

713
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:31,047
Eclair!

714
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:46,479
No!

715
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:51,317
Thank you, Natsu, Happy...

716
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:55,822
Like I said, I'm going to save Eclair.

717
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,914
Momon!

718
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:09,878
Eclair!

719
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:12,047
I <i>will </i>save you!

720
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,590
I will!

721
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,636
Excellent! Come, Phoenix!

722
01:01:18,636 --> 01:01:21,056
Give me your blood that grants eternal life!

723
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,266
Give me it!

724
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:26,353
I can't stand to see it.

725
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:31,649
A depraved man like you, living forever...

726
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:33,109
What...?

727
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:37,697
If anyone is deserving of eternity... it is me.

728
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,699
Dist...?

729
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:46,206
<i>I </i>will now become ruler!

730
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,833
An eternal ruler!

731
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:01,179
What is that light?

732
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:04,808
The light of the Phoenix's revival.

733
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,559
Master?!

734
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,977
What's in the box?

735
01:02:07,977 --> 01:02:09,938
Our trump card.

736
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,399
Then the Council has given its consent?

737
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:16,778
We took it.

738
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,717
Come forth, Phoenix!

739
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:41,636
Grant me eternal life!

740
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:50,061
What is <i>that</i>? It's not a bird?!

741
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:02,866
But it <i>must </i>have blood!

742
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,910
The Phoenix's blood!

743
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:20,300
Talk about powerful!

744
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:30,143
She's alive!

745
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:31,478
Eclair!

746
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:35,940
Where's Momon...?

747
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,819
He flew into the fire to save you...

748
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,036
Natsu!

749
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,705
Get Eclair somewhere safe!

750
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:51,706
Right!

751
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,460
There <i>is </i>no safe place!

752
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,965
If we don't stop the Phoenix,
everyone we hold dear will die!

753
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,133
Natsu!

754
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:04,844
Got it!

755
01:04:04,844 --> 01:04:06,304
Let's do it, Happy!

756
01:04:06,304 --> 01:04:07,639
Aye, Sir!

757
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:28,952
O Phoenix!

758
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,204
Give me eternal life!

759
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:32,831
Give me your blood!

760
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:42,966
"The blood of the Phoenix is the
tears it sheds when sealed away."

761
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,300
It's pointless...

762
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,303
Dist!

763
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:49,139
Don't interfere!

764
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,891
Is <i>this </i>what you wished for?!

765
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:23,423
Hang in there!

766
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:25,967
Remain calm and do as instructed!

767
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,679
Hey! You guys are wizards too!

768
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,474
The least you can do is help at a time like this!

769
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:34,851
<i>We'll </i>stop it.

770
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:36,186
Who are you?

771
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:38,271
Fairy Tail!

772
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:40,857
Hurry! Run! This way!

773
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,819
We need to get Wendy to heal you!

774
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:48,156
--I'm okay...
--No, you're not!

775
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:52,118
Lucy. I remember everything now.

776
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:54,079
Huh?

777
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,416
Veronica was built on the ruins of
Fire Village after it was destroyed.

778
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,794
My village once stood here.

779
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:03,046
Huh? But...

780
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:06,299
I was already given eternal life.

781
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:09,302
On that night, 400 years ago...

782
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:14,557
Although it was to save your life,

783
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:18,687
I have burdened you with a painful fate.

784
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:21,398
I am sorry, Eclair...

785
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:27,070
Worshipping the Phoenix Stones was a mistake.

786
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:30,407
The Phoenix must not be allowed to revive.

787
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:33,451
We <i>must </i>Dispel it...

788
01:06:35,036 --> 01:06:40,834
Should you be unable to Dispel it,
you must destroy the stone at all costs.

789
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:45,922
It is for that purpose that
you will continue to live.

790
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:52,262
But, possibly due to the Phoenix's
blood, I'd lost all prior memory.

791
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:56,850
I wandered aimlessly, carrying the
stone for no understandable reason.

792
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:01,396
For a long, long time.

793
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:06,026
Everyone I met and held dear died off before me.

794
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:15,160
400 years is an overwhelmingly long time...

795
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,080
So when you said magic
sometimes brings sorrow...

796
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,126
If you consider eternal
life the same as magic,

797
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,004
then it's nothing but pain and suffering...

798
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:38,600
Let's go, Eclair! It's dangerous here!

799
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,145
I'm immortal. I won't mind
if you leave me here.

800
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,980
No!

801
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,735
Not a single person in our guild
would run and leave a friend behind!

802
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,992
It's no good! We'll have to
take it out with direct attacks!

803
01:07:55,992 --> 01:07:58,286
But if we get close, <i>he'll</i>...!

804
01:07:58,286 --> 01:07:59,537
Dist, huh?!

805
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:10,048
Damn! Where the hell is Erza?!

806
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,469
Wait for my signal.

807
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:16,262
I will search for Eclair.

808
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:17,138
Right.

809
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,276
Why won't you just die?!

810
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:34,072
Where is the blood?!

811
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:36,783
I <i>will </i>be the eternal ruler!

812
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:43,456
Ruler, my butt!

813
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:48,878
Pointless!

814
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,551
Got ya!

815
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,344
Don't get cocky!

816
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:05,520
Can you not see...

817
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,024
...that everyone is afraid?!

818
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:17,407
Eclair!

819
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,417
We meet again!

820
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,836
What are <i>you </i>doing here?

821
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:32,756
Heard there were some
sorta special stones here.

822
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,800
Thought they might be worth somethin',

823
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,721
but it looks like I came at a bad time, y'know?

824
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,515
Funny how things connect, huh?

825
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:45,435
I'm just some lousy sneak-thief,

826
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:50,106
but if you'd caught me back then,
you might've gone splat just now.

827
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,738
Oh, man! I'm outta here!

828
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:59,366
Repay me someday! See ya!

829
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:05,372
You have the ability to
connect with people, I see.

830
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,581
Huh?

831
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:08,917
Just like you did with me.

832
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:12,712
You're not qualified to call yourself a ruler!

833
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:14,714
A ruler doesn't need qualifications!

834
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:18,843
I only need to live forever with eternal power!

835
01:10:18,843 --> 01:10:23,473
Eventually I will be worshipped,
deified, and become ruler!

836
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:26,643
That ain't what it means to live!

837
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:28,103
Enough drivel!

838
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:40,323
You hurt Lucy...

839
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,075
Lowly scum!

840
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,704
I'm...

841
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:48,665
...gonna make you pay!

842
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:00,385
It's Natsu!

843
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,850
Do your thing, babies!

844
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:11,896
Fairy Machine Gun: Leprechaun!

845
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,693
Dark Écriture...

846
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:17,861
...Slice!

847
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:25,785
Natsu!

848
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,246
Quit dawdling!

849
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:30,790
And you call yourself a Fairy Tail wizard?!

850
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:44,429
I don't have the Phoenix's blood yet...!

851
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:47,223
If we weren't afraid of dying...

852
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:49,893
I <i>will </i>have eternal life!

853
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,478
Natsu! Now!

854
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:56,232
...we wouldn't be able to treat
anyone else with kindness!

855
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,114
Yes!

856
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:11,539
--He did it!
--Yeah, but it ain't over yet.

857
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:15,418
Dist may be defeated, but the Phoenix isn't!

858
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:17,462
That's true...

859
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:20,423
--"A small, elite team"? Get real.
--Ms. Cana!

860
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,759
You're all beat up.

861
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,594
Everyone!

862
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:28,431
On Master's behalf, we decided,
"Screw the 'small team' idea."

863
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:30,517
Real men are duty-bound to fight!

864
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,519
Man, that thing's huge.

865
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,437
All right! Let's go!

866
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:38,775
The whole gang's here!

867
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:40,360
Let's do it, too!

868
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,695
Aye, Sir!

869
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:47,242
Take this!

870
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,461
Real man! Real man! Real man!

871
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:09,097
Everyone...!

872
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,478
You have wonderful friends.

873
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:16,646
Yeah!

874
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:19,941
But you're my friend too now, remember?

875
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:25,697
So this is what it's like to be happy...

876
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,782
I'd forgotten after all this time.

877
01:13:27,782 --> 01:13:29,325
Eclair...

878
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,579
Eclair?!

879
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:33,997
Oh, no...

880
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:37,625
The Phoenix is gathering power...

881
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,758
It's...

882
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:46,968
This isn't good...

883
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,685
Natsu. It's absorbing my magic power...

884
01:13:55,685 --> 01:13:58,063
Don't give up, Happy!

885
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:09,407
What's going on? My body is suddenly...

886
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:12,410
The Phoenix is sucking up magic power.

887
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,495
Huh?

888
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:17,374
It's absorbing the magic
power of all living things...

889
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,793
...to destroy the world.

890
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:23,922
This is bad! If it uses that huge thing...!

891
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:26,091
Why would it do that...?

892
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:29,052
The Phoenix wishes for true revival.

893
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:33,890
It will destroy itself and
the world to accomplish that.

894
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,434
But only the Phoenix will revive.

895
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,560
Are you serious?!

896
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,896
That's why it <i>must </i>be stopped...

897
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:42,774
...no matter the sacrifice.

898
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:44,818
Master!

899
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:48,154
Isn't that right, Lady Eclair?

900
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,825
But how?

901
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:56,830
The Fire People and their technique
to seal it away no longer exist...

902
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,125
We will destroy it, not seal it!

903
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:05,130
400 years ago, the wizard
Kalard completed a magic item

904
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,132
for use against the Phoenix:

905
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:09,175
The Arrow of Evil's Destruction.

906
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:13,513
And your father entrusted it to the Council.

907
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:18,435
So my father <i>did </i>complete the Dispel magic?

908
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:25,859
The Arrow of Evil's Destruction
will fully annihilate the Phoenix.

909
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:28,778
However, those who have consumed its blood

910
01:15:28,778 --> 01:15:31,614
will disappear from this world as well.

911
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,366
Oh, no!

912
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:37,454
When I give the signal, Erza will fire the arrow.

913
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:49,924
Erza would never fire it!

914
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:53,219
I haven't explained the details to her.

915
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:56,181
I will bear the sin in full.

916
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:00,685
Hurry. I'm fine with what will happen.

917
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:02,103
No!

918
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:05,857
No! Don't!

919
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,068
Master!

920
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,986
It's okay, Lucy.

921
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,113
No! It's absolutely not!

922
01:16:12,113 --> 01:16:14,949
I've lived for 400 years.

923
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:17,869
I don't need eternal life anymore.

924
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,250
If anything will be truly eternal...

925
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,878
...it will be my memories of being with others.

926
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:33,718
I'm sure I'll never forget Fairy Tail or you, Lucy...

927
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:35,261
Thank you...

928
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:36,680
Lucy...

929
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:43,061
Momon is waiting for me.

930
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,188
O arrow! Destroy the evil!

931
01:16:46,147 --> 01:16:48,400
No!

932
01:16:59,828 --> 01:17:00,995
Natsu!

933
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,546
Eclair! Eclair!

934
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,172
Eclair!

935
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:17,178
Oh, no!

936
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:18,179
Crap...

937
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:21,099
--Laxus!
--This is bad, isn't it?!

938
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,657
If it comes down, everyone will die.

939
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:41,244
Natsu... It's up to you...

940
01:18:04,017 --> 01:18:06,436
Someone, help!

941
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:37,050
I'm glad to have met you, Lucy...

942
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,344
Don't go! Eclair!

943
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:49,062
Lucy...

944
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:52,982
I'll never forget you.

945
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:55,402
No!

946
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:02,325
Eclair!

947
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:19,259
Thank you, Natsu.

948
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:21,803
Lucy is filled with sadness.

949
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:23,972
Take good care of her, okay?

950
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:39,446
We have to go now.

951
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:43,366
Thank you all, people of Fairy Tail...

952
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,731
I had no idea this would happen...

953
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:29,746
Eclair... Eclair...

954
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,877
Natsu...

955
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:39,673
Is magic good? Or is it bad?

956
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:52,977
I don't care if it's good or if it's bad...

957
01:20:52,977 --> 01:20:57,232
...I just wish there was a
magic spell for stopping tears...!

958
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:07,200
Eclair was smiling at the very end.

959
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,870
Natsu...

960
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,039
It's okay.

961
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:14,874
We're in this together.

962
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:20,607
<i>Where is time going to take your tears?</i>

963
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:47,634
<i>Will I find your smile there someday?</i>

964
01:22:50,637 --> 01:23:03,525
<i>The sky we always looked at says</i>

965
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:21,376
<i>The rest of our dreams will never end</i>

966
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:47,277
<i>Forever, forever, our memories will be gentle</i>

967
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:57,954
<i>So I'm sure, I'm sure</i>

968
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:11,468
<i>that I'll go to the next future</i>

969
01:24:40,705 --> 01:25:06,773
<i>Forever, forever, these feelings</i>
<i>of love will never disappear</i>

970
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:17,367
<i>So I'm sure, I'm sure</i>

971
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:30,422
<i>that I'll go to the next future</i>

972
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:47,480
<i>Forever, I'm sure, with you</i>

973
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:08,293
What wonderful magic!
