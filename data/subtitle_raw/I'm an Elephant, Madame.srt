Albeit here ... Ulrike!

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,080
an exception

The sine is also... Hübner!

yes, the proof that

22
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
No, it is ... Rull!

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,540
Yes, Gisela,
would you explain it to us?

39
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,840
Annoyed that I chose her.

43
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,160
True!
That's what you chalked up, Gisela.

44
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,140
How can it be developed further?
No Idea, not?

45
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
We're living in a society, dear Gisela,
in which in fact also ladies

46
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,160
have to program a computer one beautiful day.

47
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,960
Homework: Exercise 1 to 4 with a variant of the proof.

Emergency fixture of the government – Statistics about the career choices.

58
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,340
Does this have to be now?
Yes, Dr.

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,300
Well. Alright, state succinctly what you want to do after school.

60
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,480

Korawalski?

71
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,140
Korawalski!
Well then banker.

72
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,740
Ulrike Mom?
I'm not sure, perhaps biology.

73
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,300
Petri?
Computers

74
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,480
Rull?
I don't know.

75
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
You once wanted to become a teacher.

76
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
Got born, got holidays and died.

77
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,140
Satemin?

78
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,320
Refuse answer.
What?

79
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
I don't concur that we declare our career choice.

80
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,580
What is it?

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,860
First it needs to be explained what its purpose will be.

82
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,820
Its purpose?
The authorities need it.

83
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,660
For which purpose?
Go on!

84
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,420
Nobody can force us to support these kind of methods.

85
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,520
Disregarding that also our class teacher should have an interest

86
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,300
when we support him in his ambition to dismantle the administrative categories

87
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,380
who retain him and who we suffer from.

88
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,480
Bad grammar!

BILLA

93
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,260
Once upon a time there was a weirdo

94
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,400
Once upon a time there was a weirdo

95
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,940
who wanted to paint his room every second day

96
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,180
who wanted to paint his room every second day

97
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,100
for the reason that his grandmother loved to smell of fresh paint.

98
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,580
for the reason that his grandmother loved to smell of fresh paint.

99
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Or else she was sad,

100
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,740
Or else she was sad,

101
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,960
screamed miserably

102
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,260
screamed miserably

103
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,200
and lost her teeth.

104
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,720
and lost her teeth.

105
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,140
However at times he was too tired

106
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,580
However at times he was too tired

107
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,800
or he was ill.

108
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,840
or he was ill.

109
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,500
Fuck Germany!

110
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Fuck Germany!

111
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,380
If the 11. class could ...
Müller Frank switch to the 12. instead.

112
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,860
Why divided loyalties? It is about exhibiting an impeccable

113
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,160
and it can't be based on the fact that I'm public servant within an apparatus

114
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,840
which I can not accept.

115
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,740
Loyalty towards whom? The school or the boys?

116
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,440
There must be something wrong when one is offered these alternatives.

117
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,420
There is a possibility to travel to London for 86 Mark.

118
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,140
Korawalski had a black eye and no homework this morning.

119
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,220
Did nothing change with him?

120
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,800
At most deteriorated.

121
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,460
And in six weeks are the final exams.

122
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,100
There are no rules to the game anymore.

123
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,660
From experience: a mass protest driven by notorious objectives will either

124
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,020
be absorbed by the Establishment or will take a party choice seat in an official and therefore harmless opposition.

125
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,220
Their republic of councils will also just be another new Establishment.

126
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,780
I have never heard something more fascistic.

127
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,280
The reality of this generation is to have under your guidance, Ladies and Gentlemen,

128
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,300
too less schools,
too few teachers,

129
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,980
not enough emotional address,
insufficient humour.

130
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,200
A lack of affection.

131
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,060
And it is of course foolish when they come now and claim

132
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,140
to have no money for the tram.

133
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,280
Cause the money is there obviously.

134
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,600
If they would be prepared to purchase one Bee Gees album less per month.

135
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,200
Our top-tier Germanist.

136
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,020
Though I suspect
the youth is focussing on money

137
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,420
cause this is the only language you, Ladies and Gentlemen, understand.

138
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,940
Afternoon dad.
Na!

139
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,060
At twelve?

140
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,900
Hm.
Where is the car?

141
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh, at the garage, a mark. Bloody insurance.

142
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,400
Five past twelve!

143
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,980
The fifth class was canceled.

144
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,760
I see.
Ill.

145
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,380
Oh, who who who.
Who is sick?

146
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,700
It's anyway boring.

147
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,540
What does he have?

148
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,320
Bubonic plague.

149
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,940
Which class?

150
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,300
Fatzke, our top-tier Germanist. German.
Which class?

151
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,520
Fatzke, our top-tier Germanist. German.

152
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,700
Is he often missing?

153
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,100
No, do I know?

154
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
It's a infamy shortly before the exams. Is he often sick?

155
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,120
Morning.

156
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,840
I brought you along some sample of what I recently referred to as a renaissance of Anglo-American pop,

157
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,880
ENGLISCH
I brought you along some sample of what I recently referred to as a renaissance of Anglo-American pop,

158
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:43,980
I brought you along some sample of what I recently referred to as a renaissance of Anglo-American pop,

159
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,740
especially where the lyrics are concerned,
especially where the lyrics are concerned.

160
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,740
Precision and originality.

161
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:04,300
Besides The Bees, The Beatles, The Who, The Masters of Invention, The Small Faces,

162
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,180
I should like to draw your attention to

163
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,320
Donovan!

164
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,000
Correct.

165
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Writing on the wall ...

166
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,980
WEIGHTED AND DEEMED TOO LIGHT

167
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,640
I've seen a movie yesterday.
You've seen the Warhol yesterday?

168
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:46,820
Peter!

169
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,340
Peter!

170
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,840
He's taking a picture of a sleeping girl for 8 hours. Nothing happens, fantastic movie.

171
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,600
Among others.

172
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,420
The pupil of the 10th year aren't allowed to leave the schoolyard due to the 11-point program.

173
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,780
I must not go to the bakery during the break.

174
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,860
Cause if I go it has many downsides.

175
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,700
I could be run over.

176
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,500
I could strain my ankle when falling down the bakery stairs.

177
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,300
I could be kidnapped and be sent to Turkey.

178
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,440
And I could be killed like Robert Kennedy.

179
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,620
Besides I'd have less money and I'd beef up from all the cake.

180
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,000
And then I would have to sneak back to the schoolyard not to be seen.

181
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,020
Then I always get nervous and agitated because I'm doing an unfortunate act.

182
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,720
Conclusion: the 11-point program teacher-student panel is very right

183
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,500
not to allow 10th-year pupils to go on the street.

184
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,280
For we're still so callow and not trained by teachers in the dangers of going to the bakery.

185
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,620
I can't leave my job, would be desertion.

186
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,540
THE PRINCIPLE DR. HARTMANN DISCUSSES HIS PROBLEMS WITH HIS BROTHER

187
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,660
The situation has never been as precarious as now, never.

188
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,940
Imagine Nemels would be my successor

189
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,340
and sadly it looks like it.

190
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,740
His progressiveness would butcher the whole school.

191
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,300
Then I'll choose Violat as his substitute.

192
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:11,580
People who're always on the tail of popular trends following the latest.

193
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,260
He'd butcher my whole school.

194
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,600
That means 20 years of my lifetime,

195
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,900
my life.

196
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,780
Looks like a friendly cow from behind.

197
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Maths isn't really your hobby.

198
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,660
Na, but hopefully you know how to scoop coal.

199
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,540
How does the gradient behave currently, Rull?

200
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,540
Swell!

201
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,120
About most teacher one only knows that one can't go to them.

202
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,860
And when one knows when where it's possible cause he's likable

203
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,460
then I doesn't do it either.
Don't know either why one should do it.

204
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:10,980
For she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow!

205
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,960
and so say all of us!

206
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,660
Happy birthday to you, ...

207
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:38,320
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Gisela,

208
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,580
happy birthday to you!

209
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,900
ENGAGED

210
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,260
<i>BILD: Riots in four cities (Only riot and baton)</i>

211
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,620
I have a request.

212
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,840
We'd like to discuss last week's protest with you.

213
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,940
Yes, of course we need to grapple with it.

214
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,500
I suggest: next double lesson, Wednesday.

215
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,320
If the topic is still interesting for you by then.
<i>Bild makes stupid!</i>

216
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,980
But we don't want to disappoint Koch.

217
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,440
So Koch, start.

218
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,300
Educational terror!
Shut up!

219
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,800
You haven't prepared yourself, Ladies and Gentlemen and now try to hide it.

220
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,420
I once more want to point out that the whole class expects you to discuss with us, Dr. Nemels.

221
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,860
And I'm grateful for your cue, Satemin.

222
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,560
The factual resumé. August Strindberg was born 1849 ...

223
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
in Stockholm.

224
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,860
He experienced a mentally and materially difficult childhood.

225
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,220
After graduating he briefly studied medicine, philosophy, natural science,

226
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,920
was a tutor, tried acting

227
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,200
and by 20 had already discovered his artistic talent for literature.

228
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,980
At first he lived in Sweden while his first marriage with Siri von Essen.

229
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,380
SCHWEDEN
At first he lived in Sweden while his first marriage with Siri von Essen.

230
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,280
At first he lived in Sweden while his first marriage with Siri von Essen.

231
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,740
SIRI VAN ESSEN
At first he lived in Sweden while his first marriage with Siri von Essen.

232
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:17,760
At first he lived in Sweden while his first marriage with Siri von Essen.

233
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,340
More than with other artists his biography is inseparable from his work.

234
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,860
The reason his works have so-called eternity value is due to the poets genius.

235
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,220
A proof is not needed for this claim, which surely is no pretense.

236
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,280
The reading of his books makes them superfluous.

237
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,720
His inner biography in keywords.

238
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,660
Strindberg was born son to a father from a well off middle-class family,

239
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,540
his mother however was a maid, servant et cetera before her marriage.

240
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,260
Strindberg felt through these conditions as through his family's poverty

241
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,680
a deep sentiment of insult.

242
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,300
He in fact felt drawn to socially higher status

243
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,640
but derided and thrown to the gutter due to his mothers descent.

244
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,020
From early on he showed an exaggerated, medically described as almost pathological sense of self-worth

245
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,780
and thus a strong urge to self-analysis.

246
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,800
Dear suitors!

247
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,920
A building plan on the North Sea island Sylt requires vivid advertising.

248
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,700
The company Gebhardt salutes you with a self-made promotion song.

249
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,420
<i>I'm dreaming of Westerland</i>

250
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,980
<i>this beautiful town near the North Sea beach.</i>

251
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,540
<i>Where you buy a house from Gebhardts hands</i>

252
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
<i>the very first hands.</i>

253
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,860
<i>If only I could have such a noble house</i>

254
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,500
<i>also in Wennigstedt and</i>

255
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,140

256
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,740
<i>without no any worries.</i>

<i>Are you interested?

258
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,900

264
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,960
Gebhardt Estates. Good afternoon.

265
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,100
Good afternoon,

266
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,840
you are still building on the island Sylt?

267
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,260
Yes, single family homes with four rooms,

268
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,200
kitchen, bathroom, two WCs, developable attic, terrace and garden.

269
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,460
These Thermopen glasses, are they actually much more expensive?

270
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,600
Please sign here.
Where?

271
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
First the husband.

272
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,540
I believe Strindberg deserves ones attention.

273
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,820
Strindberg accomplished tragedies of lasting significance for posterity.

274
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,060
His creative aptitude which rose out of the inferno of an unmistakable schizophrenia

275
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,420
permitted him with the methods of self-scrutiny to re-create himself and his world on stage

276
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,740
where many of his dramas became ideals of an epoch.

277
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,300
In a few year we'll have only have half of todays teachers

278
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,700
but twice the amount of pupils. We need more graduate students!

279
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,540
E.g. 6,8% of pupils of the birth year 1980 will do the A-levels in Germany

280
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,820
I've read at Menge.

281
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,820
In Scandinavia it's 22%, in France 19% down to us.

282
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,060
Yes that will be something we're facing.

283
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,760
BERLIN 1968

284
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,060
Rohwedder comes from Berlin.
BERLIN 1968

285
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,100
Rohwedder comes from Berlin.

286
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,120
ROHWEDDER

287
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,780
And you consider Gisela to be bourgeois.

288
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,500
What do you mean, bourgeois?

289
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,960
Engaged and so on.

290
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,780
But you complain constantly that Jochen does so eccentric things.

291
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,040
That's completely different, they all find her bourgeois.

292
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,260
Kids listen. I just fucked Billa!

293
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,940
Mr Violat, I just fucked Billa.

294
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,980
Was a virgin, so sucked. But it'll get better.

295
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,880
Better luck next time!

296
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,940
Particularly the last third of the 19th century can be called the age of imperialism

297
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,020
even if precursor were discernible much earlier like England's industrial revolution and its outcome.

298
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,020
CIVICS
even if precursor were discernible much earlier like England's industrial revolution and its outcome.

299
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,460
even if precursor were discernible much earlier like England's industrial revolution and its outcome.

300
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,100
<i>HO-CHI-MINH</i>

301
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,500
Stop it!

302
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,780
Though as said prosperity

303
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,820
Though as said prosperity only begins after
after which war, Koch?

304
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
After the Franco-Prussian War.

305
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,140
And Hübner?

306
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,500
1771.

307
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,740
The after the war following years are called <i>Gründerjahre</i> in Germany.

308
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,780
But a honest notion of the impact of imperialism is more likely to get

309
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,560
when realising that already at that time

310
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:56,720
the flags of the old European nations began to fly all over.

311
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,620
An effect of the surplus production of manufactured goods and humans.

312
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,980
People emigrated,

313
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,600
goods couldn't sell on the domestic markets anymore. Thus new markets were opened overseas:

314
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,180
Asia, Africa.

315
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,420
And obtained suppliers for the insatiable demand of raw materials.

316
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,460
You've constantly mention Europe, what about the United States?

317
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,660
Later, Satemin. We're talking now about the 19th century.

318
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,520
You'll have enough time for questions, Satemin.

319
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,760
Good Morning Mr Rull.

320
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,500
Good Morning Dr. Müller-Frank.

321
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,720
Sleep well?

322
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,900
Not fully. But I didn't want to miss your lesson.

323
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,220
Can I continue?
Yes, please.

324
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,480
<i>I gorge your fish, madame. </i>

325
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,200
Another time, I'll drive you to Travemünde.

326
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,940
I think that's stupid. You?

327
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
Nay.

328
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,740
Peter, there are shrimps left. That is your bag.

329
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,420
You have goose bumps, Gisela.

330
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,600
Super.

331
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,460
<i>I have no mouth, madame.</i>

332
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,380
<i>Drum bin ich auch gesund.</i>

333
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,900
Did you leave the ball in the car?
The dog would have broken it on the beach.

334
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,280
When it's raining the revolution will take place in the saloon.

335
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,020
Peter, shall I get you a Fanta?

336
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,740
I'd like one.

337
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,380
What?

338
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,840
<i>I'm an elephant, madame.</i>

339
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,660
Somebody wants to join?

340
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,180
<i>I'm an elephant-a, madame.</i>

341
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,200
<i>And no ...</i>
Can you finally stop that nonsense!

342
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,920
Beautiful here, not?

343
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,840
Actually it's weather for cinema today.

344
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,320
I'd like to go.

345
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,560
Cute, the little one.

346
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,480
Please, they're getting younger and younger.

347
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,900
It's gonna embarrassing when you're 90.

348
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:53,080
<i>I am a Sickophant, madame. I find that blatant, madame.</i>

349
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,780
I'd like to leave not too late if fine with you.
I have to visit Rohwedder shortly.

350
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,840
Is he in Bremen?

351
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,640
In a sense quite nice being 40.

352
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,500
One finally know what they want
and they know that one can provide it.

353
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,340
Question is if one wants to provide it,

354
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,840
if one can provide it, i'd say.

355
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,240
You're entering a room,

356
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,220
You see a girl, make out and you know it's working out.

357
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,260
Make out with the one over there.

358
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,240
Not my type.

359
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,220
Lame excuse.

360
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,660
Miss, can I have two bockwurst, please.

361
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,440
A mummy, nothing for us.

362
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,080
I bet she's called Eva.
Ask her.

363
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,720
Too blond for me.

364
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Lame excuse, you only say it cause you don't dare to.

365
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,280
Just ask her.
Please go ahead. Nah, I'll do.

366
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,600
Hello, what is your name?

367
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,540
I'd ask louder so she can hear it.

368
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,260
Are you joining tomorrow?

369
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,460
<i>Hegel: The state is the reality of the ethical idea.
</i>

370
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,460
<i>Nietzsche: The state is organised immorality.
The one who commands decide who has to obey.</i>

371
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,760
<i>Hitler: The state is a means to the end for the race advancement.
</i>

372
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,780
One can substantiate this with a quote by Kikero.

373
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,260
Cicero!

374
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,880
True, it occurred to me as well at home.
I've only forgotten it.

375
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,180
Can somebody translate this?

376
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,760
Korawalski?

377
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,200
Sleeps.

378
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,900
Babara Voss, also not.

379
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:19,740
The interest of the state are to be identical with the interest of the People.

380
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,100
Rull, you shall sit comfortably.

381
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,160
But there is always the danger breaking your neck.

382
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,740
And then, what happens to me?

383
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,400
Also können wir weitermachen?

384
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,320
Perhaps somebody can complete Cicero's sentence.

385
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,660
Karsten.
Now, what do we need a continuation of the sentence for?

386
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,100
Be quiet!

387
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,740
First in latin and then it'll be translated to german.

388
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,480
Und jetzt übersetzen sie diesen Satz noch einmal für Korawalski.
And now repeat the sentence once more for Korawalski.

389
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,460
But slowly.
I've understood everything, Dr. Falk-Fliege.

390
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,500
Good!
Then we can continue.

391
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,300
Who know another analogy to Cicero's sentence?

392
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:03,480
I think we have to establish once that in our society the decisions of the community of interests

393
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,140
depend on the group that has the funds.

394
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Na na na, that is really to vague.

395
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,980
The state is after all dependent on the people who control the economy

396
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,740
and the state is just an economic model, nothing else.

397
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,080
Now the discussion is deteriorating into very general questions.

398
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,440
Now it is getting .... realistic ...,
Cripes!

399
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,620
Korawalski.

400
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,680
I notice a similarity Cicero's to the Soviet Union.

401
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,800
Man, just go over there!

402
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,300
The Soviet Union, by creating a single political party,
one in which the People together...

403
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,640
My I ask you to stop! May I? Quiet!

404
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,220
Quiet!

405
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,440
May I ask you to please return to Cicero.

406
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,800
What else did you notice with Kartens analogy?

407
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,180
Shit, I notice!

408
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,480
What.

409
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,240
It's fucking embarrassing to compare Hitler and Cicero. Fucking embarrassing.

410
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,640
Man, who has earplugs?

411
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Such people default, I'm not interested in them.

412
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,900
I mean there weren't any rules of the game at Auschwitz either.

413
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,780
Yes, back then I was a young general practitioner at the Red-Cross hospital

414
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,320
and believe that one had to tell the truth to the patients.

415
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,300
And there I've told a young lady that she had cancer.

416
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:32,680
Yes, that was the worst thing I've done during my lifetime.

417
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,380
Grützi together.
We're playing Dostojewski's glass 'Der Idiot'.

418
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,580
Mr Satimin is currently here.

419
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,020
My mother, Mr Satimin and me are invited for dinner at my sister-in-law.

420
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,260
Mrs Schniede, the wife of trade union boss Alfred Schniede sits next to me.

421
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,120
Dr. Nemels, the deputy vice-chancellor is here with his wife.

422
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,360
Dr. Hartmann, next to Mr Satimin, is also here.

423
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,060
He originally wanted to bring his brother but he is ill.
Such a bugger.

424
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,280
Everybody now as to admit what is the worst thing one did in his life.

425
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,320
Now it's your turn, Mrs Dr

426
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,740
Yes,

427
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,780
I remember how I met my husband, at the ball Paradox.

428
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,220
Oh I see, Cafe Keese.

429
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,480
I sat there with my girlfriend, we actually only went out of curiosity.

430
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,260
And then I saw Günter

431
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,940
who also sat there with a friend and nearly died laughing

432
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,440
cause the Ladies had to ask the men for a dance.

433
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,460
My girlfriend wanted to bet immediately that I'd never ask the young guy

434
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,340
to laughed hysterically, to dance with me.

435
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,180
I also had no desire

436
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,340
in a sense, but I asked anyway and made the bet.

437
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,260
Günter got bright red, he was terribly embarrassed.

438
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,540
But while dancing together I noticed immediately

439
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,060
that he'd fallen in love with me.

440
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,480
But please. What is so bad about it?

441
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,200
That she told the story, not lovey?

442
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,340
Dr Hartmann

443
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,620
If it has to be.

444
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,460
Alright.

445
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,220
Site of crime is also Hamburg. I sat in the tram,

446
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,780
must have been in '42.

447
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,080
Then there was still vacation from Russia.

448
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,300
I sat there with some friends, also officers.

449
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,680
We all sat there and then I suddenly saw this old woman

450
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,360
with a yellow star,

451
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,300
the first time even if my brother doesn't believe me until today.

452
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,460
A very old woman.

453
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,200
Anyway, we sat there

454
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,820
and she stood.

455
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,300
And I wanted to stand up and offer her my place.

456
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,620
And then I realised that my fellow officers not at all think about standing up,

457
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,460
cause well, then I didn't stand up either.

458
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,920
Günter.

459
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,520
Yes,

460
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,920
I was in the first school year. And my class theater summoned my mother to visit.

461
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,980
If I remember rightly I were only in school for 3 months.

462
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,360
And he told her:

463
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,720
Do you know, Mrs Dr. Your son, he's killing me.

464
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,000
My mother smiled and didn't understand a word.

465
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,820
But the class theater sticked to it.

466
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,260
Nah, your offspring sits in the lessons, in his corner and laughs himself to death about me.

467
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,660
What was entirely true.

468
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,440
End.

469
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,380
What.
Not valid!

470
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,980
That is completely harmless, Nemels.

471
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,520
Hm, I'm not sure about it.

472
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,620
The question is if guilt is only what we consider guilt as per the code of law

473
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,780
also also bewusstes antisoziales, also kriminelles Verhalten.
or as a deliberate antisocial and therefore criminal behaviour.

474
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,700
or

475
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,540
of the notion of guilt has to be understood as an existential problem.

476
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,220
Or not to complicate the question,

477
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:04,740
as a primal instinct that the socialised human identifies as antisocial and punishes.

478
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,220
Then you have to ask yourself earnestly if the guilt of a five-year old child

479
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,400
isn't to be considered the same as the one of Eichmann.

480
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,200
Or let's say Johnson.

481
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,120
Or whatever fashionable political references come into consideration.

482
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:26,380
Tell me Satemin, does your son seriously believe all the nonsense he spreads out there?

483
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,820
Hoffentlich.

484
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,380
Consequently the criteria for conduct can't be violence but has to be: Violence what for?

485
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:39,460
Furthermore it can't be just violence per se but the notion of violence has to be differentiated.

486
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:46,500
Again 18, again ... 18 ... my instructions. End

487
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,700
as the violence of the law enforcement agencies.

488
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,600
With water cannons and physical destruction

489
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,620
With the first sign of state violence we disperse, it is new and different.

490
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,840
The nation woke up out from their criminal indifference and must not fall asleep again.

491
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,560
It's part of the strategy. But the tactic demands from us to act as if.

492
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,500
Today is about a directed action, it is about

493
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,080
that the verdict of both summary trials against the pupils Fink and Mar will be reversed.

494
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,460
Again, don't let yourself be provoked.

495
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,820
Did you see that?

496
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,740
Well, if they want to make out on their own.

497
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,500
First around the Roland. Pass it on!

498
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,380
Around the Roland. Pass it on!

499
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,020
Around the Roland. Pass it on!

500
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,080
Chief Cold Coffee. Many courage.

501
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,980
So do you join? Yes or no?

502
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,300
Throw that crap away!

503
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,420
Then will travel.

504
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,220
Alright, but no violence and together.

505
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:05,600
No violence
Alright, but no violence and together.

506
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,820
No violence

507
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:02,780
The next thing that happened was that I was arrested by the police and taken by car to police headquarters.

508
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,540
I was treated fairly decently.

509
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,980
But I was left to cool my heels for three hours.

510
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,100
Very good. To cool my heels. Very idiomatic.

511
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,660
To be precise it means: <i>meine Fersen kühlen</i>

512
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,220
Means waiting.

513
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,540
A police officer searched me from head to toe

514
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:30,240
and I was asked to sign a document to acknowledge my responsibility for my actions.

515
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,900
Wait a second Jochen, say it once more in German.

516
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,140
The case is too important to just let it be philology.

517
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,640
So you've signed a document?

518
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,520
Yes and my father came and picked me up.

519
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,980
That is to say he's is Trapper. <i><comparable to Columbo)</i>

520
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,020
Well well, sit down.

521
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,440
Then you don't have to be surprised that the council won't be committed for your case.

522
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,060
Nah Peter.

523
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,220
How is it at the Führer's headquarters?

524
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,480
Good, thanks.

525
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,140
What is on the agenda today?

526
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,840
Chemistry, History, Latin, German.

527
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,000
And?
Class representative election.

528
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,640
Don't overreach yourself shortly before the final exams.

529
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,220
I have already enough on my plate.

530
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,180
Who will be the one?

531
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,960
That depends on the class, Dr.

532
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,580
Of course.

533
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,380
What about Anti?

534
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,460
From the educational viewpoint one should probably think about Jochen Rull.

535
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,680
You can't be serious. He is already disruptive enough.

536
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:26,020
<i>About violence oder The fascistic concept of society of Bremen's Chief of Police.</i>

537
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,700
I hope you didn't turn over trams too, Mr Beckmann.

538
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,020
You're smelling of beer again.

539
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,800
Better a drunkard than a coal dust-lung, Miss Munk.

540
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,260
What does one expect from us

541
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,200
Six hours a day as per curriculum,

542
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,140
every 45 minutes another lesson.

543
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,360
Without sense, without logic.

544
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,060
Mathematics, there is maths.

545
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:10,260
There, let's see.

546
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,140
There we don't need one.

547
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,580
So there I agree. Why shouldn't one know about cars as a girl?

548
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,140
What should be unfeminine about it?

549
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,320
Robert kicked up a serious stink.

550
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,620
And he doesn't let me drive either though I have my license since march.

551
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,980
In Israel his wife would be a sergeant.

552
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm interested in the problem Rull. He must decide if he joins or continues to be the clown.

553
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,700
When I was on the Fenner I watched out that the whole shit passed smoothly.

554
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,860
When did the teacher strike the last time?

555
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,540
When I'd be principal I'd decide that small girls are allowed at the grown-up girls toilet.

556
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,480
Why?

557
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,560
Then we could hide.

558
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,020
I don't feel it like, it's to daft.

559
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,440
Idiot!

560
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,620
Why don't you land one in his face, Dr. Wieland?

561
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,700
He can't do that, he'll end in prison.

562
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,500
Quiet please!

563
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,000
Can I assume that you made the exercises?

564
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,760
Rull, your notebook please.

565
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,980
What would you say if I'd say

566
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,700
that I don't have my homework with me.

567
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,420
Why not if I may ask?

568
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,180
What would you say if I'd say because the tram was late.

569
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,800
Tram?

570
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,720
What does the tram have to do with it?

571
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,060
If it'd have been on time I could have finished the exercise in the tram.

572
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:43,620
Until now they're still homework and tram work.

573
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,000
So out with it!

574
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:49,640
And what would you say if I'd say that I wanted to make the exercise yesterday evening

575
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,180
and suddenly noticed that my fountain pen was empty.

576
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,240
No ending.

577
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,600
When you want to pull my leg.

578
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,700
So do you have the homework, yes or no?

579
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,820
What would you say if I'd say that yes, I made them

580
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,720
but no, don't have them here cause I took the wrong notebook.

581
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,940
I'd say you've been too lazy.

582
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,340
Furthermore I would say that you're ill-fated, Rull.

583
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,260
Additionally I'd say that I have never seen such nonsense a few weeks before the final exams.

584
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,340
Maybe I can answer your question as follows.

585
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,380
The people that I usually copy maths from weren't available yesterday.

586
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,300
So you'll prepare a paper until monday, Rull.

587
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,700
About the behaviour of a curve with special attention to

588
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,200
Pardon me Dr. Wieland

589
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,700
Isn't there a directive that the weekend is free of homework?

590
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,260
I can tell you I'm finished.
I just don't know anymore what to do.

591
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,300
You're so rude and only kid around.

592
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,300
I get told constantly that you're an exhibitionist. What shall I respond?

593
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,700
They really want to achieve something grave

594
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,740
and you constantly backstab us.

595
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,780
I can't defend you anymore at all.

596
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,640
And then you tell every idiot that we sleep together,

597
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,780
Das machen 12-jährige Jungs, die kleinen Mädchen in den Hintern kneifen.
that only 12-year old boys do who pinch little girls bums.

598
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,780
Yes, terribly funny.

599
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,540
Say something for once!

600
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,500
Gorilla.

601
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,440
No

602
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,940
The problem with Rull is much more complex.

603
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,300
That he doesn't want to conform is ok.

604
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,060
Possibly even desirable.

605
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,660
But there emerges also the first question from Rull for Rull,

606
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,920
can a human bear it to constantly distance himself from all roles he has to adopt?

607
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,180
The question for me is

608
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,900
if I can tolerate that

609
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,500
an anarchist, a slob

610
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,420
gets the possibility to influence other young people trusted into my care

611
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,780
with his doubtless destructive behaviour.

612
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,020
I can't do that.

613
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,340
If

614
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,700
he planted corn,

615
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,080
he got borers;

616
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,140
If he planted potatoes,

617
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,380
he got blight.

618
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,380
Achtung, Füße nebeneinander.
Attention, feet side by side.

619
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,180
Arms ahead.

620
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,380
And right

621
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,060
and two and left and two

622
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:27,920
And now both arms

623
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,920
And one, two and three and four

624
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,180
Right

625
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,540
and two and left and two and both arms

626
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:45,020
one and two and three and four and once more

627
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:51,700
right and two and left and two and one

628
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,060
and two and three and four

629
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:03,020
and again and right and two and left and two and one

630
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,760
and two and three and
Thank you.

631
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,240
Loose up!

632
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,940
It's my dads birthday today.

633
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,900
Please forward my congratulations.

634
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,100
Happy Birthday to you,

635
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,460
Happy Birthday to you,

636
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,420
Happy Birthday Rull's dad,

637
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:41,580
Happy Birthday to you.

638
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,700
You expect to be treated respectively but then you behave like children.

639
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,620
Rull, take your things and get out.

640
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,340
And then you tell every idiot that we sleep together.

641
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,220
Small 12-year old boys who've been pinched in the bum by small girls do that.

642
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,220
Yes, terribly funny.

643
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,540
I can't understand you anymore at all.

644
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,540
Say something for once.

645
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:07,980
Gorilla.

646
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,300
Ah fuck!

647
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,260
Gropius Anaemicus Tuma

648
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:30,540
Then prove to me objective that I'm not a Kiwi.

649
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,500
Kiwis are nocturnal sylvans.

650
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,420
They spend the daytime in self-digged caverns

651
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,340
and look around searching for food in the dark.

652
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,540
They keep their beak close to the ground

653
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,700
in cracks and gaps to scent or sense their prey.

654
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,060
They then poke their beak into the soft ground

655
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,820
and pull their victims out of the cover.

656
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,860
They eat worms, insects and small animals.

657
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,400
To drink they plunge their peaks almost fully into the water

658
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,980
and raise it steeply like a chicken.

659
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,020
Now prove it to me that I'm not a Kiwi.

660
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,860
What the gaffer says.

661
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,300
Difficult

662
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:14,980
I don't agree.

663
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,420
I think positively about disciplinary measures.

664
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,060
I think there should be some more imagination shown in these cases.

665
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,060
What's up with imagination!

666
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,580
He pulls our legs since months.

667
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,900
Nonetheless one should try to integrate a boy as Rull into society time and again.

668
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:30,820
Simply said.

669
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,100
Whom is he actually harming?

670
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,940
Generation gap

671
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:39,760
Usually these cases are handled when trusting them with responsibility.

672
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,900
We all know how it is about the human Van Gogh.

673
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,660
One, twain, three, four.

674
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,860
I want to hear a very peculiar word.

675
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,540
And up!

676
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,140
After all I not only carry responsibility as a teacher but as a head of the family,

677
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,380
as a provider for my wife and children.

678
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,100
And seen from this perspective the risk I take for other

679
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,300
should not rise due to parents complaining to the Senate
PHYSICAL EDUCATION

680
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:11,340
should not rise due to parents complaining to the Senate

681
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,180
that certain teachers allegedly support the demonstrations.

682
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,060
So once again, what is Van Gogh interest in the the Potato Eaters?

683
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:22,120
I'd have to take the unfortunate consequence that you just aren't grown up yet

684
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,460
to honour the trust I put in you.

685
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,700
Thoughts are free,

686
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,820
who can guess them?

687
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,580
The third menu for me, please.

688
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,440
Jochen.

689
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,480
The menus are only available till 3.30pm.

690
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,860
Nut cake!

691
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,900
But we're already sitting here for half an hour.

692
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,900
But it is just a quarter to four.

693
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,820
Then I would have seen, don't you think?

694
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,140
But we've already arrive at a quarter past three.

695
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,780
Then the menu would have been still available.

696
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,380
Nut cake!

697
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,220
Ok then liver, or pasty.

698
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,620
The evening menu is only available from 5pm.

699
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,220
When?

700
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,480
Only the marked choices are available now.

701
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,040
Where?

702
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:06,020
Plum cake and apple cake with cream. Kale with Pinkel-sausage, potato salad, radish salad,

703
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,500
Bremer poult ragout and beverage of choice.

704
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,720
The pasty.

705
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,100
I'll have to ask first.

706
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,460
Nut cake.

707
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,140
May I have an ashtray?

708
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,720
Which topic did you choose today, Rull?

709
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,240
Thanks Huje.

710
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,380
Satemin?

711
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,980
On me I have a photocopy of a letter send by the head of school

712
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,980
to Rulls father.

713
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,200
Where did you get this one from?

714
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:44,460
Dear Mr Rull, in article 26 in the charter of the Free Hanseatic city of Bremen the following educational tasks are defined.

715
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,120
Accordingly the first educational task is to raise pupils in our young democracy

716
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,760
from a child to a human being

717
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,120
Child – friend of the humans

718
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:53,660
Quiet!

719
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:58,720
who consciously integrates into society and is prepared to take responsibilities within this community.

720
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,460
Do you really want to read out the whole letter?

721
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:00,940
Yes.

722
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:06,500
Also otiose I should like to mention that I voluntarily and inwardly feel committed to this statue.

723
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,640
The conclusion that your son Jochen violates this principle regularly

724
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,740
and with ever new manners is all the heavier because of it.

725
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,260
With earnest and greatest regret I feel compelled to inform you

726
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,340
that your son is in danger of being suspended from school.

727
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,700
Naturally I'm open for any kind of consultation this first thursday ... and so and so forth.

728
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,800
Yours sincerely, Dr. Hartmann

729
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
Ok well.

730
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,060
Shall I understand that you want to discuss a private letter by Dr. Hartmann in class?

731
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:43,740
I can't allow that.

732
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,000
I just want to add that we're determined to challenge Dr. Hartmann's decision.

733
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,800
Bravo!

734
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,160
Furthermore we're determined to call the school strike in case the

735
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,680
head of school ignores us as usual.

736
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,780
Halleluja!

737
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,620
I'm noting your proclamation, Peter.

738
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,540
Peter, am I a good class representative?

739
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,140
Not yet.

740
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,660
Then I should like to announce my resignation.

741
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
That doesn't belong here!

742
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,960
Discuss this with your class teacher, Jochen.

743
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:16,940
Ok.

744
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,600
Can I just now

745
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,920
Manifest, the fundamental rights. Article 1:

746
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,260
The pupils dignity is inviolable.
Article 2:

747
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,780
Evert pupil has the right to the free development of his individual within the parameters of the law.

748
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,740
Article 3: All pupils have the same rights as every other German.

749
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,420
Get to the point!

750
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:42,120
Article 4: Every pupil has the right to freely express and share his opinion in word, text and image.

751
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,420
Censorship does not take place.

752
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,380
That's all just rhetoric.

753
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:48,460
What do you mean with just rhetoric?
Besides I have the right to express my opinion.

754
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,940
... to abstract the letter and only consider the content.

755
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,020
To comment on the fact that Rull shall be kicked out

756
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,700
even though he just joked around.
Be quiet!

757
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,580
The manifest in which the pupils dignity is inviolable

758
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,420
Of course it is like that

759
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,180
that Jochen Rull is a pupil but we others are pupils too.

760
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,620
Your dignity is inviolable too, my dear.

761
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,080
Quiet!

762
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,240
Why quiet? That is no antithesis?

763
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,520
And if he wants to make fun of us all the time then

764
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,100
Yes, somebody touches your dignity.

765
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,420
What does it even mean my dignity as a pupil?

766
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,500
And second in democracy he shall be raised to a human being,

767
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Raised?

768
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:33,460
One can't raise him with rules and regulations.

769
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,660
Quiet!

770
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,540
No, I consider this totally wrong.

771
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:41,320
and there was something about within the parameters of law and if Jochen Rull

772
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,380
We know how Jochen Rull behaves until now

773
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,500
and this behaviour justify in no way a discharge from school.

774
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,480
I think you .. you instrumentalise him now ... Jochen

775
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,900
Dr. Nemels, we've heard our opinions several times.

776
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,200
Can we know your opinion about this letter?

777
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,920
Kurz vor dem Abitur, meine Damen und Herren,
Not all graduates, dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

778
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,300
demonstrate on the streets.

779
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,740
A lot of these graduates

780
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,020
spend their afternoons with making homework.

781
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:17,460
They have to learn vocabulary, solve difficult maths

782
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,940
or possibly fill in complicated text passages.

783
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,740
They even have to prepare for the next verbal classes

784
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:31,140
and likewise study for the written test and the verbal examination.

785
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,100
Satemin.

786
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,680
It is not about the Individuals involved

787
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,300
but if the head of school decides in compliance with the authoritarian system.

788
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,540
In this situation the pupils demand the right of co determination.

789
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,840
May I make a comment as moderator?

790
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,620
I recognize that

791
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,760
and I think it is great that a group of pupils is willing to take such a big risk

792
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,980
in a case where it sees injustice

793
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,380
so shortly before the final exams.

794
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,100
And that they possibly hazard their own future.

795
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,300
Rull, you've put your hand up.

796
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,620
I just wanted to say Dr. Nemels.

797
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,820
I think Dr. Hartmanns letter is fair.

798
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,500
Kiwi!

799
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,620
Ahh Jochen, stop the nonsense.

800
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,080
I think it is unfair and ungrateful.

801
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,140
I think the fun ends here.

802
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,860
Dr. Nemels, do you consider the letter to be unjust?

803
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,500
Then please strike!

804
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,580
I obviously can't speak for my colleagues

805
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,980
I didn't even want to know that.

806
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,500
If I'm prepared

807
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,700
in eine solche Aktion einzusteigen ist für mich eine Gewissensfrage, Jochen.
to join such an action. This is a matter of conscience, Jochen.

808
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,060
To the topic I can only say

809
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,580
presumably

810
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:48,980
That there will be a meeting with a few of your teachers tomorrow afternoon.

811
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,300
To especially discuss these questions.

812
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,380
Does anybody else ...

813
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:55,920
Bummer!

814
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,620
Dr. Nemels, we thank you for the discussion.

815
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,460
That has nothing to do with it.

816
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,300
Leave him alone.

817
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,100
6 millions killed!

818
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,280
Yes, but not by me.

819
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,160
It wasn't him.

820
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,680
I am Jewish.

821
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,980
Did you do it or me, nobody of us commit it.

822
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,340
That's not what it is about.

823
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,360
Shit!

824
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,880
And 10 millions of ours.
Ten Million people died. In Germany.

825
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,860
It's exactly the same.

826
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:00,760
Forget about it.
So what?

827
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,660
What do you mean done it yourself? Did I commit it?

828
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,620
You don't do something like this to a city as Bremen.

829
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,460
I find it incredible.

830
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,620
Yes, what of it.

831
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,620
It reminds us of such beautiful days.

832
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,260
I'm only surprised that such a thing is tolerated here.

833
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,180
Who says it's tolerated? It was just produced.

834
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,180
Why isn't there any police here?

835
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
Nobody says that it's tolerated, it's just got done.

836
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,860
Hm, do you see any public servant here?

837
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:32,740
Das Motiv gerade das Hakenkreuz zu wählen für diese Wandbemalung.
The reason to of all things use the swastika for this wall painting.

838
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,100
What did you imagine?

839
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,660
I was to young back then, I had to follow the orders.

840
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,980
I don't understand that.

841
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,340
Who says to obey orders. Who can command me?

842
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,840
The symbol as sign, I think it is a beautiful sign.

843
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,720
What do you this what kind of sign this is?

844
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,080
Hm, the sign of a sect.

845
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,360
A sect, you believe.

846
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,960
I'm just not sure which one.

847
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,320
Do you consider it tasteful?

848
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,380
No, absolutely not. That means ...

849
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,020
It is the swastika.

850
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,800
Yes, why do you think the swastika is hanging there all of a sudden?

851
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,520
I don't know, I'm sorry.

852
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,980
Is it a special day today?

853
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:10,920
No.

854
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,940
Isn't there a party

855
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,860
who has a swastika in their banner?

856
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,580
Not that I know of.

857
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,460
Do you think this was created by a party or do you believe it to be a work of a single person?

858
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,900
A party.

859
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,920
Do you have a political interest?

860
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,140
Hm, some.

861
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,460
From when on do you want to be politically interested?

862
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,740
What do you think is the age one should be politically interested?

863
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,480
As early as possible.

864
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,780
Ich würde sagen da kann man kein bestimmtes Alter nennen.

865
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,860
It is because at some point it's there.

866
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,620
Are you on vacation in Bremen?

867
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,780
I consider this illegal cause of the simple reason that it creates a bad opinion about Germany.

868
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,500
If a foreigner, and let it be only 30 foreigner on the market square, that means 30 foreigners

869
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,280
will speak out against Germany.

870
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,740
What kind of countryman are you?

871
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,140
I'm from Romania.

872
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:04,980
Thank you.

873
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:10,040
Die Schande die der der die Ding da, die Rune ist für sich kein Zeichen,
The disgrace that the the rune there, the rune isn't a sign

874
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,100
when I may correct you, it's a rune.

875
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,260
Old germanic symbol.

876
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,700
Germanic symbol?

877
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,700
Old germanic symbol.

878
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,020
And we've put them all in a gas chamber, we've crippled them all. I've been a soldier myself.

879
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,820
But I don't want to be a soldier anymore, not even at the German armed forces.

880
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,520
And even if they punished me for it.

881
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,660
Bravo! Daft, daft!

882
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,320
And now you only have to add a Soviet star.

883
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:35,700
Must be something political.

884
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,820
Something political

885
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,960
Yes, there are two possibilities.

886
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,820
Entweder ist er Linksaussen oder ist er Rechtsaussen.
Either he is a far-left a far-right.

887
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,320
He's acted counter-revolutionary, it's a disgrace!

888
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:49,100
I think it's exuberant stupidity, nothing else.

889
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,300
Yes, there is no, nothing there

890
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:59,220
that could have been let's called it learned from the so far published Nazi trials.

891
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,200
If this young man would have been drafted into the Hitler Youth

892
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,180
Yes, but he's not.

893
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,400
He isn't, well, alright.

894
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,900
What we need are camps where this kind of guys are sent to.

895
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:14,780
Such a vandal, look at him. Look at that face.

896
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,640
He has long hairs,

897
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,580
an infamy.

898
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,600
And he's not washed either.

899
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,420
There you're standing and discuss with these people

900
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,920
who obviously destroy democratic-liberal constitution.

901
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,860
And what would you do with this young man if he'd be punished?

902
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,920
Hang him, immediately.

903
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:35,500
Why?

904
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,800
Hang him, at once.

905
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,280
Why?
Why?

906
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,540
Cause this kind gave us enough misery.

907
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,900
So you support capital punishment?

908
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,240
Completely agree.

909
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:44,800
Completely agree.

910
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,580
Certainly!

911
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,060
Would you do it yourself?

912
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,140
Me, no!

913
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Hang him, I mean.

914
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,160
To hang him, yes!

915
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:55,840
Have you've already been deathsman once?

916
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,520
No, but I was in a concentration camp.

917
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,600
Do you believe he's paid by a party?

918
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,320
The building?

919
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,740
No, the lad. The young agitator.

920
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,500
I wouldn't want to call him a lad.

921
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:14,900
Yes.

922
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:19,620
But it's a mindless act. People, who suffered below this symbol

923
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:23,580
this rune as I've said

924
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:28,580
and me, me as a Berliner, 40 year old Berliner

925
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,020
have to witness this once again and I was a soldier. And I've also been with the Russians

926
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,240
and get to know the and I don't want war anymore.

927
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,660
Go over to the GDR, there you can do it.

928
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,660
Do it there. But you're yellow.

929
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,300
Yes, you do it here cause nothing happens to you.

930
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,220
But over there, go to the GDR

931
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,500
and show off. Stand your ground there!

932
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,460
Then I'll respect you, but like this

933
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,180
you're only foolish boys.

934
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:58,780
This is a motion picture that wants to ridicule us

935
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,080
which wants to make us look farcical, ridicule the police,

936
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,140
you stupid boys!

937
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,940
In this situation in which we're now. That the left is weak, the restrictions deepen,

938
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,260
the conservatives gain. When you do a motion picture in this situation

939
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,020
which attacks all sites equally

940
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,620
and questions all sites.

941
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:21,020
Then there is the function, and you have to admit the function will be

942
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,340
people saying it's all bullshit.

943
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,260
Politics is rubbish, the left sucks

944
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,000
and the one on the Top also suck.

945
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,400
Shit everywhere. That especially these people get confirmed in their opinion.

946
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:35,980
Our contributor Ischt Wambouri witness the following scene

947
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,020
on saturday morning 10 o'clock during the shooting in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen.

948
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,740
You dumb wethers.

949
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,220
Grandpa, don't leave the scene!

950
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:55,380
These dumb wethers.

951
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,140
Ne, they've told you off.

952
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,060
Told me off?
<i>Grandpa, take your dog!</i>

953
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,940
Me, cause I don't understand this nonsense.

954
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,500
Do you know what treats you right?

955
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,180
Clout round the ears, left and right.

956
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,780
Hang me maybe too?

957
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,140
Grandpa that are your children.

958
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,740
Your children?

959
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,140
A matter of upbringing?

960
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,740
There we have the gift giving.

961
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:30,500
Let's say I would have painted something else, a naked woman or naked genital.

962
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,940
It is a biological fact that contaminant will be segregated.

963
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,720
The poor boy.

964
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,270
The poor boy.

965
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:39,300
Does anybody know his father?

966
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,220
Only a swastika.

967
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,740
Rascality. Not acceptable.

968
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,400
A partisan like Rull should be brought down..
Full stop!

969
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,820
I'm afraid we'd have an empty school soon.

970
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,940
It's not my fault I wasn't alive back then.

971
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,860
Somebody should have talked with the boy.

972
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,260
but you also have to see the tourism here.

973
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,140
I'm a child of this society an I fight for this society.

974
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,020
I'd have to leave then to Cuba.

975
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:03,220
Rull downright wallowed in his scapegoat existence.

976
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,080
Somewhere I've failed.

977
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,960
He didn't mean you, boss.

978
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,300
What is your suggestion?

979
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,700
Defect?

980
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,820
Join the demonstrations? Also paint swastikas on the wall?

981
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,940
It's about the right case in the right moment.

982
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,420
Do you have a special-clock that shows when?

983
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,500
I only know

984
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,860
and this isn't very original

985
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,540
that I wouldn't know what to do when I'd have to decide freely.

986
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:12,100
Probably Eastern Block propaganda.

987
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,260
But in this case there is no leeway following the regulations.

988
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,300
We now address the pupils committees proposal

989
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,900
to advise the pupils committees of other grammar schools in the Hanseatic city of Bremen

990
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:18,380
to go on strike together with pupils of this school

991
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:21,620
due to the authoritarian decision of the school administration

992
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,860
to discharge the pupil of class 13b.

993
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,420
In a manifest sent to the administration

994
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,940
we demand the right of co determination

995
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,380
in fundamental questions with concern the school community.

996
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,720
We're ready to take the necessary steps to convince

997
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,940
the administration as well as the school authority

998
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:44,960
respectively force them to grapple with our concerns.

999
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,820
The case is known to us all

1000
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,940
and I suggest that we vote straightaway.

1001
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,900
So.

1002
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:08,900
So.

1003
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,780
Who is in favour

1004
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,180
that we align ourselves as members of this school

1005
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,120
with Jochen Rull?

1006
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,000
Wait a moment

1007
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,100
Everybody above the 10th year has the vote.

1008
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,180
Yes please, Dr. Müller-Frank.

1009
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,260
I know I'm a bit out of place here

1010
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,340
and you know much better then me how to deal with these cases democratically.

1011
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,380
However!

1012
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,780
Regardless!

1013
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,460
Please be quiet! Dr. Müller-Frank has the floor.

1014
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,860
Regardless I'd like to have ask this question.

1015
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:01,140
Why did Jochen Rull paint the swastika on the school wall?

1016
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:02,820
I've only wanted to have asked it.

1017
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,540
You're the best one to know!

1018
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:11,640
Quiet!

1019
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,540
Quiet! A moment!

1020
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:14,980
Stop!

1021
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,840
Wait a moment Peter, that's not the way. That is unfair.

1022
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,500
All right, i'll bear it in mind..

1023
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,820
Quiet!

1024
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,740
Quiet!

1025
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,860
Quiet!
What is this about, what is this about?

1026
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,300
About the decision of the pupils or can we only polemicise?

1027
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:09,420
Please be quiet! Silence please!

1028
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,940
Please be quiet, kids.

1029
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,580
This serves no purpose like this.

1030
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,860
Klaus Rohwedder, please.

1031
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,500
May I also say something?

1032
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,540
Is Jochen Rull in the hall?

1033
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:25,860
Yes!

1034
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:26,420
Come up!

1035
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,420
I think you can help us here!

1036
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:53,180
Please explain why you choose the swastika

1037
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:57,320
to expose the fascistic tendency of the school system.

1038
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,360
But only if you want!

1039
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,400
Leave him!

1040
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,560
You're after all Rohwedder.

1041
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,060
The one we read so much about in the newspapers.

1042
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,540
I'd have a question:

1043
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,780
Mr Rohwedder, you've been once centre forward at Almsbüddel.

1044
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:10,560
What?

1045
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,240
I'd like to know how it happened back then

1046
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:15,460
that Almsbüddel won 8:3 against the HSV.

1047
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,460
Who? Where?

1048
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,780
Yes, Hamburg. 8:3

1049
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,300
I've read it.

1050
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,420
Jochen, excuse the question ...

1051
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,420
Sure, Almsbüddel.

1052
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,500
Centre forward.

1053
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,220
It's quite some time ago.

1054
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,240
No, never.

1055
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:29,940
Oh

1056
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:33,340
Oh, then you aren't the Rohwedder from Almsbüddel.

1057
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,260
Could it possibly be your father?

1058
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,020
My father, no.

1059
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:45,060
When I think about it,

1060
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,820
it must have been your grand father.

1061
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,900
Is he also called Rohwedder?

1062
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:55,140
We'd possibly be willing to judge the school strike positively

1063
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,100
but only,  mind, after the final exams.

1064
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,700
I'd have to convince a committee of this first.

1065
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,280
Yes, Peter.

1066
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,260
One doesn't have to destroy the overall form to change it.

1067
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,660
FINAL EXAMINATION

1068
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,060
The ones ready can bring me their notebook and leave the room.

1069
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:26,280
<i>... AND WHEN WE HAVE TO DIE.</i>

1070
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,860
<i>We does not want to be mistaken for bums? We!</i>

1071
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:32,420
<i>GERMANY MUST LIVE AND WHEN WE HAVE TO DIE.</i>
<i>We does not want to be mistaken for bums? We!</i>

1072
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,220
<i>GERMANY MUST LIVE AND WHEN WE HAVE TO DIE.</i>

1073
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:35,660
<i>Who cares about peace on earth? We!</i>
<i>GERMANY MUST LIVE AND WHEN WE HAVE TO DIE..</i>

1074
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,640
<i>Who cares about peace on earth? We!</i>

1075
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:45,660
<i>You prowl in parks and streets, </i>

1076
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:50,040
<i>who can't take your senseless sloth? We! </i>

1077
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,440
<i>We! We!</i>

1078
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:00,660
<i>Who has the courage to be ashamed of you? We! </i>

1079
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:07,480
<i>Who doesn't let their future be robbed? We! </i>

1080
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,520
<i>Who sees you daub old churches, </i>

1081
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:17,600
<i>and has to loose all respect for you? We!</i>

1082
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,720
<i>We! We!</i>

1083
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:30,620
<i>Cause somebody has to be there who not only destroys</i>

1084
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:36,520
<i>who nurtures our faith, </i>

1085
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:44,480
<i>who learns, who educates themselves, performs his pensium, </i>

1086
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:50,160
<i>for tomorrow's building the world.</i>

1087
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:56,640
<i>The world of tomorrow We already are!</i>

1088
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:03,180
<i>Who doesn't stay forever the vocal crowd? We!</i>

1089
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:12,960
<i>Who even says that work only ruins,
so bored so excessively dazzled?</i>

1090
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:18,020
<i>You! You! You!</i>

1091
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,860
<i>Who wants to try talking with you openly again? We!</i>

1092
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:31,000
<i>Who of course also has their weaknesses? We!</i>

1093
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:40,900
<i>Who even has very similar fads,
also long hair just washed?</i>

1094
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:45,120
<i>We! We! We!</i>

1095
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:54,600
<i>Also we are for rigour,
we also have beards.</i>

1096
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:00,620
<i>We often go too far too.</i>

1097
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:08,740
<i>But sometimes in good,
in silent minutes,</i>

1098
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:15,000
<i>we're sorry for different things.</i>

1099
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,420
<i>Who has not lost hope? We!</i>

1100
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:27,520
<i>And thanks those giving birth to us? We!</i>

1101
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:37,360
<i>But who just wants to protest,
until there is nothing left to protest?</i>

1102
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,240
<i>You! You! You!</i>
