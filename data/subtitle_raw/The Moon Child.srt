1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,700
The Moon Child

2
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,296
I almost forgot to tell you.

3
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,363
Don't ask for Coke.
Why not?

4
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,696
"That gives you cancer,"
he says.

5
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,976
Is he normal?

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Outwardly yes.

7
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,366
What did he do?

8
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,965
I do not know.

9
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,770
He's not tracking.
Disturbed, yes.

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,161
Hello.

11
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,764
I've already seen you.
Probably.

12
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,726
To drink something?
Water.

13
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,889
Sit down.
No, don't have to.

14
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,847
Thank you.

15
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,842
Damn.
You shouldn't have been drinking after me.

16
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,891
Now you are infected.

17
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,964
In a month you will have a tumor.

18
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,969
Jacob... it's a joke.
Asshole!

19
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,767
You never make friends that way.
You are hopeless.

20
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,530
I don't give a shit.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,842
If you weren't sick, I would hit you.
Drop dead!

22
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,681
I want water.
I'll take it myself.

23
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,490
Fancy a video game?

24
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,167
You can be really stupid!

25
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,404
Why did you do that now?
I'll apologize.

26
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,131
Stomcup.
Come on now off.

27
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,322
What are you doing?
Come with me.

28
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,609
Come on baby.
Damn!

29
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,331
Come on baby.

30
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,443
Tackle!

31
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,563
What's that weird thing?
Let me go!

32
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,442
How's the pain?
Present.

33
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,922
So we continue to take painkillers.
Maxilase 3000?

34
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,328
That one as well.

35
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,966
I can still smell the burning smell.

36
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,205
That will remain the case for a while.
You must rest well.

37
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,489
Sorry to disturb,
but it's Roman.

38
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,206
He called three times already. Is something wrong?
Not really, but...

39
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,887
Tell me to call back.
He's in your consulting room.

40
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,843
In my consulting room?
Yes.

41
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,051
What is going on?
Issues.

42
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,370
What is that?

43
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,209
Where did I leave my glasses?

44
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,802
Write about a fantasy character:
knight, damsel, dwarf, wizard.

45
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,642
Name, properties, motivation,
story, age, appearance.

46
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,087
Fifteen spelling errors.
'Age' is TIME.

47
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,330
Chloe.. is the webshop designer
my next appointment?

48
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,801
Ask her to wait ten minutes.

49
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,362
What interests you?

50
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,927
Not the dwarf, not the knight, not the wizard.

51
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,607
So the lady.
Yes, and then...

52
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,444
I had to go to school to keep from being
bored and now I'm getting stupid work.

53
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,490
Don't whine, we only have ten minutes.

54
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,765
It sucks.
I'd rather know if they don't find a cure.

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,125
What are those doctors doing?

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,763
Investigate, Roman.
While you think of the damsel.

57
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,286
Or made-up damsel, blonde, brunette?
Brunette.

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,370
Brunette.
What a surprise.

59
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,044
Psychological profile?

60
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,721
If you fell in love with her?
uh, cool.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,525
Cool.

62
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,846
Like me, but a girl.

63
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,166
So cool.

64
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,611
Well done, great!

65
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,489
Bye.

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,841
Can you sit down?

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,924
Awesome.
Give her a round of applause.

68
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,840
The next candidate is a doctor.

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,890
A professor of medicine.

70
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,808
Good evening sir.

71
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,370
Come on.
Good evening.

72
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,608
Good evening.
What is your name?

73
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,330
David Assollant.
You are?

74
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,605
I'm a surgeon.
Shall I call you professor then?

75
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,525
No... David is fine.

76
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,924
David...
Tonight you are here for a purpose.

77
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,562
Yes, to fund a potholing trip.

78
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,529
For children with XP.

79
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,122
XP. Can you briefly explain that?
Very short.

80
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,651
It is a rare genetic disease
that causes poor recovery

81
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,246
of DNA under UV radiation.

82
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,126
Beautiful.
Applause to David!

83
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,650
Are you ready for the 50000 dominoes?

84
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,247
Yes. 47500 to be exact.

85
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,882
47500. Go ahead, David.
(A thunderous applause)

86
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,446
What is happening?

87
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Afterwards we add up the points of the finalists.

88
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,329
Not the easiest part...

89
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,691
I'm looking for a man, quite tall, in his fifties.
Have you seen him?

90
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,049
No idea.
I didn't pay attention.

91
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,846
But see for yourself.
Thank you.

92
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,843
I've been looking for you for two hours.

93
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,242
I waited until the end.
Is the party over?

94
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,206
Everything fine?
Yes, it's fine.

95
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,729
Will you join the others?

96
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,641
You go.
I'll wait here.

97
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,651
Tell Angèle and Lucy I'm getting some rest.

98
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,091
Tonight I'll show you something amazing.
Awesome!

99
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,849
Go now, Roman.

100
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,483
What is happening?

101
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,604
Fixed short circuit.
So no heating.

102
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,961
But it's day.
I have to call.

103
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,247
It was never made on time.
Aren't you sleeping?

104
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,649
I'll call outside.

105
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,569
He's panicking.

106
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,641
He was acting weird last night too.

107
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,850
A public appearance is not for him.
He enjoys it!

108
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,203
Once when we were on guard duty,
we decided to play mime.

109
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,211
David disappeared, but when it
was his turn,

110
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,968
he suddenly appeared
in one of those restraint suits

111
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,650
with gold hypothermia foil as a
cape.

112
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,283
On his head he had a star-shaped
crown made of polystyrene.

113
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,925
They came from all floors.
Patients, nurses, everyone.

114
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,363
He was drunk,
but he was a prince.

115
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,689
What was he?
Halley's comet.

116
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,565
That morning he had been told that
his brother had passed away.

117
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,810
He hadn't told anyone.

118
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,690
Let's go.

119
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,843
Boys, take it.
Come on, wake up.

120
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,450
I have no gloves.
Anna has no gloves.

121
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,170
No gloves?

122
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,570
If you don't mind choking.

123
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,686
Please baby.

124
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,724
Thank you.
Here we go.

125
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,089
What did you want to say?
I have to tell you something.

126
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,802
It's personal.
I don't like that.

127
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,204
Who do you think you are?

128
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,284
One trip and he plays the gentleman.
I don't want to hear it.

129
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,205
You die like us, sick handsome.

130
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,323
You are a jerk.

131
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,202
What's with Anna?
I don't need to talk to her.

132
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,603
No.
But you have to be nice.

133
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,885
Since she's terminal, I do
n't need to talk to just yet.

134
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,685
We don't pity, Roman.
You know that.

135
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,404
Look at me when I talk to you.

136
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,490
Go apologize.

137
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,367
You don't care.
You've had tons of chicks.

138
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,726
I do not know what it is.

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,082
I will never make love.
No more time for that.

140
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,483
We do everything to give you time.

141
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,488
I've been married for seventeen years,
so I haven't had that many chicks.

142
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,371
Liar!
I know.

143
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,770
Jerk.

144
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,650
I didn't know your brother was dead.
That sucks.

145
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,844
In the second gene therapy we are developing,

146
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,403
we do not insert an exogenous gene into the XPC cell,

147
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,281
but ask the cell
to correct its mutation itself.

148
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,842
For this we use the homologous
recombination technique

149
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,447
repairing double-strand damage

150
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,766
after exposure to oxygen or
nitro radicals in the environment

151
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,245
or remote radiation.

152
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,122
There's the substitute.
Where?

153
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,810
Five rows down,
four to the left.

154
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,408
Doctor Carlotta Nicoli.

155
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,047
With the long hair?
Yes.

156
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,888
I sent you the results of Habib's
DNA repair.

157
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,044
My secretary got them.
I watch it. It's quite a bit...

158
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,248
I watch it.
Promised. Do not walk away.

159
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,002
David.
Everything fine?

160
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,521
Yes, I'm fine.

161
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,967
Bravo, this is good for you.
Thank you.

162
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,488
You're a bit of a hero.
If you say so.

163
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,208
You were so ranting about grants,
they had to ask you.

164
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,688
You're going to wake them up.
I'll try it already.

165
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,364
That's what we sound like!

166
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,080
XP - advanced stage

167
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm tired.

168
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,610
I'm going to get some sleep.
I have an appointment in two hours.

169
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,365
I'll wake you up.

170
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,407
Letter from WHO is here.

171
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,770
They called.

172
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,689
Mathilde asked if you don't
want to work on guard duty on the evening of the wedding.

173
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,645
In case you forget.
Come on.

174
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,609
I didn't say anything about the transfer.

175
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,808
You do that?
Yes.

176
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,050
I'm actually hungry.

177
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,124
Paul's girlfriend is not happy with
our move.

178
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,800
Female friend?
Does he have a girlfriend?

179
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,969
Yes.
Already a month.

180
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,448
Why can't I see her?

181
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,046
You are indeed free between
midnight and five o'clock.

182
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,970
I want to see her.

183
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,450
Have you tasted?

184
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,881
It said "Di Bufala" on the suit.
Yes.

185
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,565
Awful.

186
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,241
Trial.
No, this early in the morning...

187
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,850
Awful.

188
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,049
They cheated me again.

189
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,482
I'm going to sleep for an hour.
are you waking me up?

190
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,009
The Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym,

191
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,723
by Edgar Allan Poe.
Bah.

192
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,002
How so?
You don't even know him.

193
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,607
It's about storms, survivors,
shipwrecks.

194
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,207
Really something for you.
Someone named Poe? No, thank you.

195
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,806
At the time it was one of my favorite books.

196
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,361
It will feel cold for a while.

197
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,927
I knew it by heart.
Beginning and end.

198
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,208
Oh yeah?
And how will it end?

199
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,524
"Then we plunged into the embrace
of the waterfall,

200
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,401
where a chasm opened up for us.

201
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,485
But in our path stood a veiled
human form alone,

202
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,282
a lot bigger than any
other inhabitant of the earth.

203
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,370
And the color of his skin was
perfectly white as snow."

204
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,565
Sit up straight.

205
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,804
You can have it.

206
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,409
Look at the back.

207
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,287
Why?
You bit into it.

208
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,411
On your first visit,
when you were two years old.

209
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,167
You bit others too.

210
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,450
I have two small CBCs

211
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,164
in basal cell carcinoma.

212
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,051
We don't have to do anything right away,
but...

213
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,330
Come a little closer.

214
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,370
Wait, no.
Like this.

215
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,520
Anything else to register?
Yes.

216
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,729
If I
operate on you at the end of the week,

217
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,891
I'll do the rest right away.
There's no hurry.

218
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,761
I'm the doctor.
I decide if there is a rush.

219
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,440
And I might go on vacation.

220
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,370
Shows.

221
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,407
That is nothing.
It can wait.

222
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,281
I wipe it clean.
I'm making some photo galleries.

223
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,481
Head up.

224
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,489
Hair out of the way.

225
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,930
Guard.

226
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,491
You're in top shape, boy.
Very funny.

227
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,650
Really... it's going well.

228
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,529
Are you still taking your vitamin B12?
Yes.

229
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,206
And Aldara?

230
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,561
Do you use those?

231
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,171
I know it's no fun

232
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,046
but we have nothing better against carcinomas.

233
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,250
Why are you looking like that?

234
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,448
Just like that.

235
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,408
But your shoes are cool.

236
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,201
Are you okay?
David's going on vacation.

237
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,160
What?
He forgot to tell us.

238
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,171
Ah, well...
that's good news.

239
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,966
It must have been about three years ago.

240
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,489
It's okay.

241
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,889
Blockage of the ear canal causes
partial deafness in the right ear

242
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,168
without affecting daily
life.

243
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,882
Hoogachtend, blah-blah-blah...
David Assolant.

244
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,530
I receive wine as a gift after every ENT operation.

245
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,004
Miss Nicoli is here.
Should I let her in?

246
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,322
Chloe, take those flowers away?
The smell is too strong. Horrible.

247
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,726
Hello. Doctor Assolant.
Mrs. Nicoli? Miss. Nice to meet you.

248
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,531
We met in Paris.
Yes.

249
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,168
Didn't I keep you waiting too long?
No problem. I'll be right there.

250
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,288
Drink your coffee quietly.

251
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,410
We can talk here.
Fine.

252
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,848
You can immediately discover the department.

253
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,682
I saw one of your patients outside.
A moon boy.

254
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,730
Have you talked to him?
No.

255
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,166
He will be my first XP.

256
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,449
You must give me his antecedents.

257
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,962
As a student I saw you at a
colloquium in Montreal.

258
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,841
Do you remember?
You are running against an American doctor who...

259
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,130
Coffee please.

260
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,171
I won't hear you say things like that
again.

261
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,087
That is not entirely true.

262
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,210
You look a little disappointed.
No.

263
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,369
Not at all.

264
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,482
I'm going upstairs and we'll talk later.

265
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,048
Today it will be difficult.
I'm busy.

266
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,520
But we got acquainted.

267
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,643
Bye.

268
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,607
I don't want you to pay for my coffee.

269
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,251
I wanted someone stronger.

270
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,644
Someone who
can cope with acne, hives and cancer.

271
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,530
I think you are not suitable.

272
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,845
Jacob!

273
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,805
Jacob!

274
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,885
Hi.
How are you?

275
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
Like with a kid who swims alone at night
.

276
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,251
Guillaume scolded me.
Don't mind.

277
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,205
This is Aitor.
Hi.

278
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,569
This is Noémie, my neighbor and
William's new girlfriend.

279
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,521
I did not know that.

280
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,961
It's scary to swim in the dark.
How do you do that?

281
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,282
There are no waves.
It's not dangerous.

282
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,246
You are insane!
We freeze. Bye.

283
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,927
Are you asleep yet?

284
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,524
On the wedding cake.

285
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,490
Come on.

286
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,808
Do you do it or should I call.
No, you have to.

287
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,324
<i>You have one new message.</i>

288
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,407
<i>Come by tomorrow.
I have to tell you something. David.</i>

289
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,800
Hello.

290
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,803
How are you?
Good. And with you?

291
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,644
Hey Hello.

292
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,042
Well...
How are you?

293
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,643
What does the hood look like. Or is the seam.

294
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,723
Roman, in the lock in two minutes.

295
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,041
Inside.

296
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,482
Hello.
Hello.

297
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
What is?
Why doesn't it?

298
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,969
Hello.

299
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,601
I'm Dr. Nicoli, I replace...

300
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,561
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about
Ms. Boar's spinocellular.

301
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,121
Will you join us?

302
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,800
I'll be right back.

303
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,291
You must introduce me.
I can't show up all at once.

304
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,681
But you did.

305
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,962
Doctors should support each other in the face of adversity.

306
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,525
I know that.
It's not mine.

307
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,126
It's Article 56.

308
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,881
You're leaving, that's not easy.
But I'm here.

309
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,725
Yes, you are there, that is clear.
I am not done.

310
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,090
How do we do it then?
I am not done. That's just the way it is.

311
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,405
Sorry.

312
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,484
I must earn your succession
, but I do not despair.

313
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,331
Damn.

314
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,124
Sorry.

315
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,242
My colleague...
No problem.

316
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,169
Are you moving?

317
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
And.

318
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,644
I'm leaving, Louise.

319
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,566
I'm going to or WHO in Geneva.

320
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,763
To work with the director
on rare diseases.

321
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,890
Care for XP patients, including,

322
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,520
or subsidy, and so on.

323
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,247
So it will be a little less fieldwork.

324
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,810
More ministerial work, so to speak.

325
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,646
Like this.

326
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,125
Congratulations.

327
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,171
Yes I am happy.
Real.

328
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,206
I didn't know you applied for that job.

329
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,806
A few years ago. Twelve years ago.

330
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,884
Then I didn't get the job...

331
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,010
and now yes.

332
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,207
Nothing will change for Roman.

333
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,201
Someone will take over from me,
you will not be left to your own devices.

334
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,126
Do you understand what this means to him?

335
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,691
You must tell him.

336
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,526
What a mess.
What is happening?

337
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,126
Isn't the suit out yet?
No.

338
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,764
Have you not been in your sas?

339
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,687
David has something to tell you.

340
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,243
I'm going to Belgium.

341
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,129
Anna is dying.
She has...

342
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,850
I'm coming.
I want to see her.

343
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,449
Damn disease.

344
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,010
Do I hear me, Anna?

345
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,724
It does not matter.

346
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,762
No, I'm kidding.

347
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,245
You do not have to be scared.

348
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,891
I'm sure they're exaggerating.
It is nothing.

349
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,520
Your friend in the hospital is nice.

350
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,971
She's not my girlfriend.

351
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,207
It's none of my business.

352
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,170
Did you have sex with an older girlfriend or a prostitute the first time ?

353
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,606
Are those the options?

354
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,890
In the books you give me, it's
always one of the two.

355
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,366
It was my cousin.

356
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,926
So a bit of both.
I'm not your schoolmate.

357
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,401
All right...
Sorry.

358
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,689
But that's not the point.

359
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,886
You dare not ask the real question.

360
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,607
What the kissing and undressing was like.

361
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,525
I do not care.
How so?

362
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,331
How was it then?
What?

363
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,651
Then.

364
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,530
Well, after that...

365
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,241
I lay naked against her,
against her skin.

366
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,402
And when you're ready...

367
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,328
you will wonder whether to laugh
or cry.

368
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,323
I will do like everyone else...

369
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,208
You will hide in her hair.

370
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,968
And after that, when you've made love, you'll
find it wasn't so hard,

371
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,969
that you didn't need to know anything

372
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,888
and that your bodies were doing pretty well.

373
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,208
And if you could do it over,
you would do it over.

374
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,484
But that's not really the point.

375
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,883
Actually, yes.
No.

376
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,241
The woman we love should not
complain. That's what it's about.

377
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm not hungry anymore.
Then don't eat any more.

378
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,164
It is hot here.

379
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,488
Good evening.

380
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,569
Don't worry,
it's not a gun.

381
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,248
Were you scared?
- Not really.

382
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,409
Anyway.

383
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,770
Just kidding.

384
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,811
It's okay.

385
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,889
Would you like something to drink?

386
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,406
Good evening.

387
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,489
Hello Mama?
It's me.

388
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,886
With David's phone.

389
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,050
We ate in a restaurant.

390
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,287
Do you piss while calling your mom?
Yes.

391
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,008
You don't call while you piss.
She must have heard.

392
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,130
She's my mother.
That's why.

393
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,650
Go wash your hands.

394
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,486
And shake off the drop before you put it away.

395
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,164
Did no one teach you that?

396
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,685
With all fingers, not just those two.
I'm just telling you.

397
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,365
Thank you.

398
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,691
I wanted to go to rugby or evening training
, but the spots are full of UVs.

399
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,044
Did your father play?
Can't bomb me.

400
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,922
He was there that first time.
He carried me.

401
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,050
Bullshit.

402
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,886
There were three of you when
I gave my diagnosis.

403
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,006
I said it was once in a
million that something was incurable...

404
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,647
well, that the cure would yet be found.

405
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,961
I had to protect against cancer.

406
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,121
If you hadn't said that, he might
have stayed.

407
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,770
Maybe.

408
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,120
He has another child with his new wife.

409
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,328
It doesn't happen twice.

410
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,806
The child may be sick.

411
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,930
He should have stayed and
shared the misery with us.

412
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,850
It's great misery.

413
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,641
What would you have said if you had
known I was sick in Mama's tummy?

414
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,404
That they had to keep me?

415
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,522
Don't know.
What do you think?

416
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,326
If you prevent someone like me from
being born,

417
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,281
That means I shouldn't have existed.

418
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,966
Do you feel that way?

419
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,650
And.

420
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,410
They lost.
Yes, they lost.

421
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,930
It does not matter.

422
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,605
It's a game.
Losers are the most beautiful to see.

423
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,491
Good...

424
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,284
I'm afraid.

425
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,329
Yes, me too.

426
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,768
Slept good?
Yes.

427
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,843
You're lucky you can shave.

428
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,208
Do you want to do it?
I cut you, I can't.

429
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,601
No look.
I trust you.

430
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,367
I hold it like this.
Take this.

431
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,761
Your fingers like that, like a claw.

432
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,008
Like this.
Now you gently put it against it.

433
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,606
You tense the skin.
Like this.

434
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,129
Carefully. And when it's flat,
you gently go up.

435
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,328
So...
Go ahead.

436
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,525
Nice.
And rinse.

437
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,803
You start again.

438
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,849
Yes please.

439
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,489
So... Stop, stop.
That's good.

440
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,483
Now you are waiting for your own beard.

441
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,165
Roman, come on.

442
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,605
What is that?

443
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,850
Is that the Atomium?

444
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,967
Is he a guide?
I can not hear you.

445
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,250
Is he a guide?
Yes, he is my guide.

446
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,923
They want to come with us.

447
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,560
You do match the decor.

448
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,286
Bye.

449
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,881
Did you say yes?
No.

450
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,964
It could have been fun.
Well...

451
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,364
The psychologist doesn't want me to
become antisocial because of my suit.

452
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,285
Do you see her again?
Just kidding.

453
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,641
Take it off.

454
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,440
Cool, is it?
Yes.

455
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,763
Funny how small cars are.

456
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,125
Do not you think so?
Yes very nice.

457
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,444
They are really tiny.

458
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,891
Sometimes I get bored.

459
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,721
But it would be even worse without you.

460
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,731
Yes, but sooner or later...
What?

461
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,565
Nothing.

462
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,645
I won't be there anymore.

463
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,684
You are not dead yet.

464
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,008
No, that's not.

465
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,603
And the backpack.

466
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,964
Do you never lock your car?
No never.

467
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,003
That way they take what they want without destroying it.

468
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,490
Dad had his new child this afternoon.

469
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,361
Are you happy? Are you going there?

470
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,048
Certainly not. I don't want to see him.
And the child leaves me cold.

471
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,487
Roman... it doesn't leave you cold.

472
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,962
You know what? We go together.
No!

473
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,085
Why, no?

474
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,250
Come on.

475
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,604
I'll call your mother and my wife that we'll be late.

476
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,929
It's two hundred miles!
Two hours.

477
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,885
Damn!

478
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,849
Which one is it?
The girl under the lamp.

479
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,885
Okay, cover up.
Why?

480
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,367
They are UV lamps, against jaundice.

481
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,244
Come a little closer.

482
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,330
I'll take it off. Take off your glove
, then you can touch her.

483
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,609
I will hurt her.
No. Put your hand in.

484
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,291
She's hot.
Feel her feet. At the bottom of.

485
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,762
That's the best spot.
Go ahead.

486
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,764
She's ticklish.

487
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,802
I'm putting it back on.
Put on your glove.

488
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,568
Finished?

489
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,446
She's ugly, but funny.

490
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,447
<i>A leather dress like an hourglass</i>

491
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,082
<i>Spicy, but not fast</i>

492
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,608
<i>And in it, like a sailor</i>

493
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,845
<i>a rocking girl.
She seems somewhat English</i>

494
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,010
<i>What a beauty</i>

495
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,567
<i>And Moody Blues sings the night</i>

496
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,202
<i>Like white bridal satin</i>

497
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,170
<i>In the harbor of the night</i>

498
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,524
<i>A rocking girl</i>

499
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,251
<i>On the quay</i>

500
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,126
<i>What a beauty</i> . Terrible.

501
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,401
<i>What a beauty</i>

502
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,649
<i>What a beauty</i>

503
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,566
<i>What a beauty</i>

504
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,090
Thank you.

505
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,285
Bye, mom.

506
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,042
Good evening.

507
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,966
Monday we will remove that stain in my neck
. After the holidays, we said.

508
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,321
Eight o'clock.

509
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,849
You won't be treated any worse
now that he's gone.

510
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,161
Is he leaving?

511
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,724
Didn't he tell you that?

512
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,444
No.

513
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,764
He would tell you.
He is transferred.

514
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,567
Ten. On site, please.

515
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,088
You start, I finish. You trace.
Certainly not.

516
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,568
You only watch. That was the agreement.
Excuse me?

517
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,804
I do the deletion.

518
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,807
How so? We
prepared the operation together.

519
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,850
Should I just admire the head of the department?

520
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,691
He apologizes, but he did
n't plan it that way.

521
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,161
Fuck that old jerk.

522
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,201
His mother called.
She looks for him everywhere.

523
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,010
You are no longer my doctor.

524
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,567
Was that you that night on the beach?

525
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,089
Yes.
What were you doing?

526
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,847
Walking around.
I'm doing my pedicure internship. Beyond.

527
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,404
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.

528
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,729
It's Jacob's birthday. I invite you.
- Okay.

529
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,402
It's a costume party. Pack of your choice.
See you tonight.

530
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,244
He didn't show up.
I heard.

531
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,646
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

532
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,807
I don't have to pack a lot.
Find someone else.

533
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,007
For the record.
I want you.

534
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,363
It may be the job of my
life, but not what I dreamed of.

535
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,966
I dreamed of someone strong.

536
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,682
Someone who can deal with hives,
melanomas... and a substitute, damn it!

537
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,440
Not such a tone, Carlotta.

538
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,848
You are ten years younger than me.

539
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,731
This department runs smoothly,
you just have to keep up.

540
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,731
It took me twenty years to
build this.

541
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,325
So don't think...

542
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,290
that you can teach me a lesson.

543
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,406
Why should you love your job more
than I do?

544
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,205
Why would it be more valuable?

545
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,410
Is it more legitimate because you
know an incurable boy?

546
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,562
Doctor Assolant!
What a man!

547
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,810
Jesus.

548
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,730
Out.

549
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,850
Out.

550
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,887
No.
You go out.

551
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,805
What is?
Nothing.

552
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,961
I have some medical knowledge, you know.
Isn't there a Band-Aid here?

553
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,601
In right drawer.
No, the judge.

554
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,004
Halley's comet.

555
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,482
I don't know if I would have recognized you.

556
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,641
You are a minor, I decide about your health.

557
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,490
He doesn't touch me anymore.

558
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,176
It's about helping guys like you.
He cares about the money.

559
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,611
Hold on, Roman.

560
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,322
Your cocktail.

561
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,960
Thank you.

562
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,050
Can I do that too?

563
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,281
Trial.

564
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,087
Say no, mom.
Say you can when I'm older.

565
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,289
I'm sorry about the surgery.

566
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,842
Also apologize to him.
I don't owe him anything.

567
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,085
Quit it.

568
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,291
Look what I found in the image.
A mummified bird.

569
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,403
You have a crazy job.

570
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,290
Just my half-sister.
That's how she looks.

571
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,884
You are kidding me.

572
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,564
How do I come across?

573
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,010
Why are you getting rid of it?

574
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,721
Did you make a choice?
The steam menu.

575
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,485
Two.

576
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,285
Hello, come in.

577
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,566
Congratulations.
Thank you.

578
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,202
Hi.
Who are you going to bite tonight?

579
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,124
We'll see.

580
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,682
We're not training tomorrow.
They switch places in the stadium.

581
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,327
Special lamps, without UV.
For you.

582
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,926
I did not know that.
I didn't ask anything.

583
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,010
Do you know my girlfriend?
Yes.

584
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,281
Back.
Back.

585
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,210
We can kiss.

586
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,926
White on white, that does not stain.

587
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,802
Dancing, Miss Japan?
Why not?

588
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,883
Come.

589
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,611
I hear you wear a mask during the day
. Why not last?

590
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,684
That is a secret.

591
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,048
So you go out at night.

592
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,405
Yes, with the bums and drunkards.

593
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,240
Will you take me with you one day?
On a night.

594
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,811
If you want to.

595
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,484
I feel like.

596
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,564
Sorry. I was in the hospital,
I had a...

597
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,650
An operation that went wrong.

598
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,089
I called.
I need him for a second.

599
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,730
Do you come?

600
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,965
What is?
What happened?

601
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,050
Listen.

602
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,684
I'd rather you openly piss off

603
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,129
than to feel such pity.
It's awful.

604
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,766
Five thousand euros for places.
We got a Belgian.

605
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,730
That is normal.

606
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,123
Oh yeah? I have no pity.
I'm afraid.

607
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,723
You are awful.

608
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,360
I don't know which of us...
Okay, I'll stop.

609
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,568
We go back to our old life.

610
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,370
You can't just force a job on someone.

611
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,329
Just go.
I'll be right away.

612
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,171
Sir?

613
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,409
Call an ambulance.

614
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,046
I thought I had seen Roman.

615
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,927
Did he come for you?

616
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,200
And.

617
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,442
He's been coming for three days.

618
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,371
To prepare for the operation later.

619
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,521
He's with the anesthesiologist now.

620
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,449
And did he cooperate well?

621
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,325
Yes.
But he did say you find him difficult.

622
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,007
He's a bit upset. Squirt
Spino into his neck.

623
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,523
Why wasn't I there when you spoke to him?

624
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,765
Because it's not necessary.

625
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,760
I wanted to show you his folder today.

626
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,291
You must rest.

627
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,241
Are you okay? Shall I join?
No.

628
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,566
What?
Nothing.

629
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,962
Come follow the operation.

630
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,291
I'm sure I'll need you somewhere.

631
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,168
We don't have to tell Roman anything.

632
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,882
He wants nothing more to do with you.

633
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,447
Did he say anything else?

634
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,446
He thought my office was ugly, badly decorated

635
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,080
and with a terrible smell.

636
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,602
I saw Mrs. Garnier was gone.

637
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,091
It was too early.

638
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,243
She had relapsed.

639
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,122
Bye Roman.
Are you going to lie on the table?

640
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,405
Are you OK?

641
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,407
I could have had a drink with you,
then I would have taken you home.

642
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,360
What's holding you back?
I do not have a car.

643
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,406
And I'm supposed to stay until tomorrow.

644
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,208
Then I'll take you home tomorrow.

645
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,091
Hi.
Are you hurt?

646
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,328
It's okay.

647
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,805
Don't I get a kiss?

648
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,408
I'd rather break up, Noémie.

649
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,401
I don't like it.
It's pointless.

650
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,324
I prefer that I decide.

651
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,086
It was nice wanting to go out with you,
but now it ends.

652
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,926
I'm not leaving because you
arouse pity.

653
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,242
I want to continue with you.

654
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,089
Now you don't say anymore.

655
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,808
Hello.

656
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,809
<i>
When I lost my brother ten years ago , I didn't want to heal anyone.</i>

657
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,884
<i>And then suddenly there was Roman.</i>

658
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,364
<i>I couldn't cure him, but he
needed care. I went for it again.</i>

659
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,442
<i>When Audiberti greeted people,
he shook hands and asked:</i>

660
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,080
<i>"And? Still five fingers?"</i>

661
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,325
<i>This morning I realized I
could no longer answer yes to it.</i>

662
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,406
<i>From now on I am a doctor without patients.</i>

663
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,562
<i>I would like to leave the hospital
alone one last time, without crutches.</i>

664
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,848
<i>Although I would have liked to have given you a lift.</i>

665
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,291
<i>Kiss, David.</i>

666
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,202
I've been waiting for ten minutes. <u>
You have to put a coin in it.</u>

667
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,806
Nice of you to come.
How are you?

668
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,767
Yes fine.
I'm going to see if there's...

669
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,528
are you coming to me?
Yes, I'm looking around...

670
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,449
Do that, look around.

671
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,643
Stripes from last summer.
Very nice.

672
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,925
Bye, mom.

673
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,407
Hello.
I didn't know you'd
be so early.

674
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,410
How was the movie?
Was okay.

675
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,324
What are you doing here?

676
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,646
I was invited.

677
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,845
I'm going to get something, I'll be right back.

678
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,248
Did you bring the flowers?

679
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,730
She never waters them.

680
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:49,050
Did you eat?
- Yes... What was it?

681
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,560
Quiche and bacon cubes.

682
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:57,170
She can't cook. Never could.
It's hot. No, don't touch.

683
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,722
What is it?
Chocolate cake.

684
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,242
Take the salad cutlery.

685
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,201
That's not cake.
Of course it's a cake.

686
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,687
A chocolate cake.
See, that's...

687
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,961
Goodbye, Harold.

688
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,922
I think it's not baked enough.

689
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,811
No, it looks fine.

690
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,761
Damn!
Stand up!

691
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,888
Stand up!
Let me go!

692
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,322
Off the field! To the locker room!
And not a peep!

693
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,083
It hurts.

694
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,005
Laurent, you take over.
I'll sort it out.

695
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,568
There is nobody home.
Oh..-no?

696
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,684
Mom's not home.
Then where is she?

697
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,322
To a drink.
A party for my doctor.

698
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,124
My ex-doctor.

699
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,847
Then why did you come to play?
I didn't want to go there. That's my right.

700
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,682
I didn't want to go there.

701
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,888
It's none of my business, but...

702
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,724
It's none of your business!

703
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,684
I didn't think you were cowardly.
I'm not cowardly.

704
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,244
I don't know what he did.

705
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,648
What then?

706
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,846
Also a too hard tackle?

707
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,169
Did he treat you?

708
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,321
Good evening.

709
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,926
Hello.
Everthing okay?

710
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,886
Good evening.

711
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,648
One two three four five. OK, so.
Yes, it's fine.

712
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,168
Where is our hero?
How is Roman doing?

713
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,726
Good.
David, come on.

714
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,321
Good evening.

715
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,402
It hurts me to say goodbye.

716
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,081
I know your talent will go elsewhere.

717
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,604
When you were a young student,
you asked me for advice one day

718
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,286
when choosing your specialization.

719
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,011
I couldn't help you.

720
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,963
You objected to some of my choices.

721
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,803
Are you coming for my father?

722
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,011
And.

723
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,166
A precocity, and a reliability

724
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,005
for which I ask all your friends for a
grateful round of applause.

725
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,130
Good evening.

726
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,801
This isn't mine,
it's from the book of David.

727
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,410
It's called Michael.

728
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,368
Coward, you have courage.
But where?

729
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,411
Don't know.
He is like a stranger to you.

730
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,086
I don't know how
to activate it.

731
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,323
So look no further, it's here.

732
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,451
Fool that I am,
dozed off because of your slovenliness,

733
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,207
and indifference because you run away

734
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,846
to new horizons.
Then search.

735
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,164
It's stupid not to.

736
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,449
But don't go get him where he isn't,

737
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,286
or in yourself. He wouldn't last.
He destroys you

738
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,889
and does not survive. It's not a laugh.
Good evening.

739
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,487
I'm not that young, but I can
read a nice text.

740
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,722
Like I just said...

741
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,848
Give him a warm round of applause.
Thanks again.

742
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,362
Thank you.

743
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,570
I'm not much of a speaker.

744
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,445
Sorry.

745
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,448
It's always hard to leave...

746
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,888
from people you love...

747
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,684
Horrible.

748
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,645
From a job that…

749
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,850
that I have dreamed of since childhood.

750
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,689
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

751
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,523
A year later.

752
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,525
Come on!

753
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,044
Come on Roman!

754
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,289
Come on guys.
Harold takes him
.

755
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,809
Have you had this before?
No.

756
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,280
Roman, are you okay?

757
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,730
It'll be fine.

758
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,246
And?

759
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,490
What?

760
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,004
Where is he?

761
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,766
Good.

762
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,925
Thank you.

763
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,048
Very good.

764
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,127
Turn around, young man.

765
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,610
Very good.

766
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,450
We are waiting for the results of the MRI.

767
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,244
Roman, are you freaking out?

768
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,965
Roman?

769
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,205
Are you afraid?

770
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,608
Don't know.

771
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,331
And?

772
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,729
Yes, he's here with me.

773
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,043
Good.
What kind of webshop interior did you want to do?

774
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,530
I explain to him and call his mother.
No, I prefer to do it myself.

775
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,128
You stay with us.
Web shop interior?

776
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,770
Now.

777
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,402
Tomorrow we have to do a biopsy.
I'm not free.

778
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,526
How so?
I go to a movie with friends.

779
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,808
It's been agreed for a week.

780
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:09,048
Okay.

781
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,482
Then come tomorrow night.

782
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,926
Thank you.

783
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,289
What are you doing tomorrow?

784
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,408
Did Carlotta tell you that things aren't going well?
Is that why?

785
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,640
No.

786
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:06,290
I am visiting friends.

787
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,163
What a butt-licker.

788
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,721
And I wanted to see you.
So...

789
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,000
Last year I didn't want you to leave.

790
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,968
Have you wondered what I went through?
Yes, but I'm not a doctor.

791
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,364
I made love.

792
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,770
I'll go now.

793
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,565
Bye.

794
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,445
Hello.

795
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,970
It's broken.
He knows very well what he has.

796
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,088
He vomits constantly.

797
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,691
At what time tomorrow?
Seven o'clock.

798
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,766
We gave him some to sleep with.

799
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,161
I don't have my suit.
Where is it?

800
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,288
Mama took it to wash.

801
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,771
Does not matter. We don't
need it where we're going.

802
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,404
I'll bring him back in eight hours.

803
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,326
Will the head of department prance?
I do not care.

804
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,840
Come on.

805
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,408
Are you succeeding?
Yes.

806
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,965
Give me your hand.

807
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,084
Lean on me.

808
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,207
Are you OK?
Yes.

809
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,531
You just have to say it.

810
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,771
Beech is.

811
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,122
This is millions of years old.

812
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,561
It is beautiful.

813
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,043
That's why we came.
Because it's beautiful.

814
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,881
Can I say something?

815
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,003
I'm not asking you to leave me,
but I don't want you to stay.

816
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,002
If you're a worm, it means I
'll make it.

817
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,324
But I'm not staying.

818
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,922
<i>Those high nylons</i>

819
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,369
<i>Like strings on a violin</i>

820
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:30,049
<i>In that piece of skin troubled</i>

821
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:34,085
<i>By bow from which my song
flows</i>

822
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,802
<i>What a beauty</i>

823
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,890
<i>And under or barely closed
veil</i>

824
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,442
<i>A jesus black tuft</i>

825
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,121
<i>Moist in his cradle</i>

826
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,126
<i>As a swimmer, no longer expected</i>

827
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,770
How long will it take you?

828
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,367
An hour or thirteen. It depends.
I'll call.

829
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,930
Am I out of the operating room?
Then we do it in reverse.

830
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,849
You call me, okay?

831
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,691
Everything fine?
Did it go well?

832
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:23,960
I walk with you.

833
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,401
Bye.

834
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,765
Safe journey.

835
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,087
Hello David?
With me.

836
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,171
It is over.
Where are you?

837
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,247
At the lake?
Lucky.

838
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,764
Did it go smoothly?

839
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,084
They say I'll make it.
With this.

840
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,567
And the rest can wait.

841
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,080
Everything is OK.

842
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,586
To kiss. And call me occasionally.
I like that.
