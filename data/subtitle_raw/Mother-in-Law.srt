00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,416
DAI DIEN - SOUTHERN VIETNAM
1950s

2
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,791
This story is passed down in Dai Dien,

3
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,083
an ancient land of prosperity,

4
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,041
about the legend of the women
in Councilor Huynh Van Linh's family.

5
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,333
The one in the picture is Mrs. Hai Xuan,

6
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,458
also known as Councilor Hai Linh.

7
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,958
She spent almost her whole life

8
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,458
obeying and enforcing
the harsh rules of tradition.

9
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,875
Her obligation to the Huynh family
would only be fulfilled

10
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:12,708
when she could find somebody to pass on
the key to the family heirloom.

11
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,083
This is Ms. Ba Tran,

12
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,541
who will follow Mrs. Hai Linh
and take care of the Huynh family.

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,083
Seeing as her father is
an oriental medicine practitioner,

14
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,916
she developed a passion for herbs.

15
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,916
Ms. Ba Tran is a beautiful
and graceful woman.

16
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,583
After getting married to Mr. Hai Nhut,

17
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,708
the only son of Councilor Huynh Van Linh,

18
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,791
she became their eldest daughter-in-law.

19
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,916
Ba Tran!

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,375
Mrs. Hai Linh longs for a grandchild

21
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,333
to be the heir of the Huynh family.

22
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,875
How dare you disobey me!

23
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:54,708
Nonetheless,
Ba Tran antagonized her mother-in-law

24
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,041
by losing her first child.

25
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,416
Her life has been tumultuous ever since...

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,833
On a spring day of the 18th year
of the Dai Dien’s calendar,

27
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,666
Mr. Hai Nhut married his second wife,
Ms. Bay Loan,

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,583
only two years after his first wedding.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,250
This was arranged by Mrs. Hai Linh
to satisfy her wish for an heir.

30
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,250
Today is a blissful day.

31
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,250
We are delighted

32
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,875
to open our hearts and to open our doors

33
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,166
to welcome the groom and the bride.

34
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,208
Bride, groom,
please serve wine to your mother.

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,916
Grapefruit flowers drive away evil.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,666
Grapefruit leaves keep ghosts far away.

37
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,958
May the newlyweds be blessed
with many children.

38
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,958
&lrm;The bride is so beautiful.

39
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,666
Ms. Ba, Councilor Hai Linh calls for you.

40
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,958
Something was broken!

41
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,000
Breaking things during a wedding
is a taboo,

42
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,875
and you did it in purpose.

43
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,208
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.

44
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,166
You didn’t?

45
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,875
"Of the three ways of being unfilial,
not bearing a son is the worst."

46
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,666
Among the three sins of being unfilial,

47
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,750
not having a son is the worst one.

48
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,625
You’re well educated.

49
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,083
You should’ve understood that.

50
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,416
During the two years as the
daughter-in-law of the Huynh,

51
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,375
you have never been asked to do anything.

52
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,875
You can't even fulfill your
only obligation of producing an offspring.

53
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,916
Mother-in-Law,
procreation is a natural process.

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,250
It isn’t something
I can make happen on my own.

55
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,875
You’re kind. I hope you can understand.

56
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,041
Our family's blessing is
not yet that depleted.

57
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,625
Don't lecture me on this.

58
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,625
Mother-in-Law, I don’t dare to.

59
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,833
Such a toxic tree that bears no fruit.

60
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,291
Mother-in-Law...

61
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,666
It’s you who lost the first child
of the Huynh family.

62
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,541
What do you have to say now?

63
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,208
You're an evil woman who can bear no son.

64
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,833
Take a good look at this.

65
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,916
Tell me what it is!

66
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,583
Don't assume that if you keep silent,
I won't know about your wicked weed.

67
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,208
Mother-in-Law,

68
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,333
please forgive me.

69
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:24,041
It's just because of my ambition.

70
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,416
-You want Hai Nhut to be crazy about you.
-Mother-in-Law.

71
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,083
You don’t deserve to be
the Huynh’s daughter-in-law.

72
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,875
-Chin Ti!
-Yes, ma’am.

73
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,750
Take her to the annex.

74
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,666
-Forbid everyone to go nearby.
-Mother-in-Law, please.

75
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,166
-Mother-in-Law...
-Get off of me.

76
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,458
-Mother-in-Law...
-Didn't you hear what she said? Go.

77
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,750
Mother-in-Law.

78
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,791
Mother-in-Law.

79
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,916
-Mother-in-Law...
-Go!

80
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,583
Mother-in-Law.

81
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:00,000
SUMMER

82
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,083
ONE YEAR LATER

83
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,708
To brew the magic black rosemary,

84
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,416
you must find the blood of a virgin.

85
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,625
No man

86
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:47,250
can resist the allure of black rosemary.

87
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,500
Even the most toxic snake will be charmed.

88
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,666
I’m sorry.

89
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:12,750
It has been one year that you
have been forsaken because of me.

90
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,000
Mother has probably calmed down by now.

91
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,333
I will bring you back to where you belong.

92
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,500
I just need you to keep thinking of me
and impregnate me soon.

93
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,041
Ms. Hai, something has gone wrong.

94
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
-Ms. Hai!
-What happened, nanny?

95
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,958
The ferry Mr. Hai Nhut took this morning
has crashed.

96
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
Mr. Hai Nhut's condition is not yet known.

97
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,916
Hai Dia just came back to inform us.

98
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,291
Councilor Hai Linh has fainted.

99
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,125
I pay respects
to the Huynh family's ancestors.

100
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:22,500
Please protect and save Hai Nhut.

101
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,916
Please help Bay Loan have a safe delivery.

102
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
-Ms. Ba Tran.
-What?

103
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
Mr. Hai Nhut is dead.

104
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,416
Mother-in-Law.

105
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,083
It’s you again.

106
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,375
Why don’t you try to have some manners?

107
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,708
I have something urgent to tell you.

108
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,750
What is it now?

109
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,416
Hai Dia just came back to inform us.

110
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,666
They found Mr. Hai Nhut's body.

111
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,875
You're lying.

112
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,750
I don't dare lie to you.

113
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,041
It's impossible.

114
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,916
Mr. Hai Nhut is dead.

115
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,916
No, I don’t believe you.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,875
-I’m telling the truth.
-I don’t believe it.

117
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,041
Mr. Hai Nhut is dead.

118
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,708
-Mother-in-Law.
-Go away!

119
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,791
You're a poisonous snake.

120
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,125
You have brought misfortune
to your husband.

121
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,625
Do you hear me?

122
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,333
Hai Nhut!

123
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,541
Hai Nhut!

124
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,833
No!

125
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,500
The Huynh lineage cannot be cut off.

126
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,250
Mother-in-Law!

127
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,916
Mother-in-Law!

128
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,583
Mother-in-Law!

129
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,291
When you see someone having a seizure

130
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,125
with rolling eyes, a twitching mouth,
convulsion and jerking limbs

131
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,708
press firmly on the acupuncture point
called the Man's Middle...

132
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,625
and prick the fingertips to prevent
that person from being paralyzed.

133
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,791
Such a toxic tree that bears no fruit.

134
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,041
You're such a poisonous snake.

135
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,958
You have brought misfortune
to your husband.

136
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,208
Councilor, Ms. Bay Loan
has given birth to a boy.

137
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,125
Ms. Bay Loan has given birth to a boy.

138
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,833
Ms. Bay Loan has given birth to a boy.

139
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:38,708
-It's a boy.
-Ms. Bay Loan has given birth to a boy.

140
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,375
Get her a towel.

141
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,208
That year, Ms. Ba Tran gave birth
to a boy named Phuoc.

142
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,708
She officially claimed back her title
as the eldest daughter-in-law

143
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,000
and took over the power.

144
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:25,666
Yet, she still wasn’t given the key
to the heirloom to replace Mrs. Hai Linh.

145
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:41,458
AUTUMN

146
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,958
16 YEARS LATER

147
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,833
&lrm;They sang beautifully.

148
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,625
Attention, people of Dai Dien!

149
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Let's welcome Ms. Ba Tran.

150
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,708
Ms. Ba Tran has come.

151
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,666
Ms. Ba Tran

152
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,875
Ms. Ba Tran,
please make your announcement.

153
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,458
Hello, everyone.

154
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,750
As you may know, after the annual harvest,

155
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,750
the Huynh family often holds a competition

156
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,208
for everyone to compete and have fun.

157
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,458
I’d like to announce that...

158
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,083
this year’s prize
will be three tons of Nang Thom rice.

159
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:38,125
I want to play.

160
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,625
-I want to win the prize.
-Mr. Hai Phuoc...

161
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,583
Hai Phuoc.

162
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,458
Mother, I want to play.

163
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,416
Hai Phuoc, be a good boy
and return the drumstick to Hai Dia.

164
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,416
Come here and sit with me.

165
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,041
Tu Thi, lead Mr. Hai to his seat.

166
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,000
No, I want to play.
I don’t want to sit there.

167
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,666
Be a good boy and listen to your mother.

168
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,791
This competition isn’t as easy
as playing with your locust.

169
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,250
It’s really dangerous.

170
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,125
You’re too slow for it.

171
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,958
Who said he couldn’t play?

172
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,041
I mean...

173
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,166
this competition
is for the servants only...

174
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,583
No, I want to play.

175
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,458
It’s just for fun.

176
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,125
If he really wants to play,
then let him play the drum.

177
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,458
Bring the drum here.

178
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,583
Come on!

179
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,625
I will allow you to play
but only with the drum.

180
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,875
I can do it.

181
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,750
Remember, you are Ba Tran's son

182
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,375
and heir to the Huynh family.

183
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,250
So do your best.

184
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,375
I will try my best.

185
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,833
Go, go!

186
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,625
Whoever puts the bag of rice
into their goal first

187
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,666
shall win the competition.

188
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,666
Both teams, get ready. And start.

189
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,958
Faster!

190
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,500
-Faster!
-This way!

191
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,416
Faster!

192
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,458
Faster!

193
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,208
Faster!

194
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,958
Faster!

195
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,375
Give it to me!

196
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,583
Over here!

197
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,750
Faster! Faster!

198
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,541
Mr. Hai, run! Run!

199
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,500
What are you waiting for? Run!

200
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,041
Hai Phuoc.

201
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,666
Run!

202
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,750
Mr. Hai!

203
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,166
Go, Mr. Hai!

204
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,625
What are you waiting for?

205
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,625
Hurry up!

206
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
Go!

207
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,208
Mr. Hai, faster!

208
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,041
Go!

209
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,250
Come on, Mr. Hai, faster!

210
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,791
Up, up you go!

211
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,250
It's in!

212
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,791
We won!

213
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:55,375
Mr. Hai Phuoc's team has won!

214
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,500
Mr. Hai is brilliant!

215
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,500
Mother, I won.

216
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,750
I won!

217
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,041
Congratulations!

218
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,875
Goodnight, ma'am.

219
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,166
-Mr. Hai.
-No.

220
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,916
No, I don’t want to.

221
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,125
Mr. Hai.

222
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,208
-Mr. Hai.
-I’m playing with my locust.

223
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:38,791
Stand still so I can measure your body.
Then you can go play.

224
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,625
Come here.

225
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,041
Forty-six.

226
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,416
I don’t want to.

227
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,291
Mother.

228
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,250
I don’t want to!

229
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,375
Be a good boy and stand still
so he can make nice clothes for you.

230
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,458
I already have nice clothes.
I just want to go out and play.

231
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,875
I know. But these will be better.

232
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,625
Do you remember what I told you?

233
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,708
Who are you? Answer me,
and I will let you go.

234
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,083
I’m the son of Ms. Ba Tran,

235
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,250
heir to the Huynh family.

236
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,833
Excellent. Now stand up.

237
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,166
Good boy.

238
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,416
Mother said I’m a good boy.

239
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,291
Next.

240
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,208
These rice grains are low grade,
so 10 sheaves will be increased to 15.

241
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,375
-Move.
-The rice is fine. He's acting strangely.

242
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:55,125
They are really
pushing the price down.

243
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,000
How was this rice milled?

244
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,833
This doesn't look good.

245
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,583
Your 20 sheaves are increased
to 25 sheaves.

246
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,625
You're so harsh on us farmers.

247
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,333
If you think so,
then don't rent the field.

248
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,291
See who will end up starving.

249
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,916
This has always been the rule!

250
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,541
Next!

251
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,083
No one can stand this!

252
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,375
Auntie, Uncle.

253
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,333
Tu Thi.

254
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,708
-Hey.
-Don't just call her by her name.

255
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,791
You will offend the councilor.

256
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,791
It's all right, Uncle.

257
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,500
Why do you want to see me?

258
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,458
This year's harvest is bad.

259
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,000
We...

260
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,666
We'd like to ask you a favor.

261
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,125
Please ask your mother-in-law
to see whether...

262
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,291
we can pay her half of our rent later on.

263
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,375
We will pay after the next harvest.

264
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,458
-Auntie, Uncle, I...
-What's going on, Ba Tung?

265
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,333
Well, Chin...

266
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,291
Faster!

267
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,958
You're asking for a payment extension,
aren't you?

268
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,083
Well, this has been a bad harvest...

269
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:19,250
Remember, Mrs. Hai Linh
is still in charge here.

270
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,416
No one can speak for her.

271
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,166
I don't dare to think so.

272
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:31,125
I think only you can handle this.

273
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,958
Anyway, Ba Tung,
you did contribute to the mill.

274
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,291
All right.

275
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,666
Let me try to talk to Mrs. Hai Linh.

276
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,791
-I owe you big time.
-Thank you.

277
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,416
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

278
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,791
Please understand.

279
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,375
My opinions don't matter here.

280
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,375
We understand the difficult position
you're in.

281
00:24:56,208 --> 00:25:00,166
Get back there, or you will be scolded.

282
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,541
Goodbye then.

283
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,458
Mr. Hai.

284
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,666
Mr. Hai. Please get inside.

285
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,916
I'm playing with my locust.

286
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,541
Mr. Hai.

287
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,333
Your mother will scold me
if she sees you here.

288
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,083
Mr. Hai.

289
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,750
You stalker.

290
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,708
I don't want to play with you.

291
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,750
Mr. Hai.

292
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,916
I'm your wife.
Why do you keep calling me sister?

293
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:52,458
Mr. Hai, you've been playing all morning.

294
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,250
Now let's go inside so I can bathe you.

295
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,666
I'd rather play with my locust.

296
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,958
-Mr. Hai.
-I don't like playing with you.

297
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,791
I'm playing with my locust.

298
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,500
It's so fun.

299
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,583
The lotus looks sad
at the end of the season.

300
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:46,541
Let's pick a few then go home.
Ms. Ba Tran will yell at us if we're late.

301
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:51,750
I have to admit that
Ms. Ba Tran is not only pretty

302
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,625
but also very smart.

303
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,375
Watch your mouth.

304
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,166
I'm just saying the truth.

305
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,583
Don't do that.

306
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,875
We're only servants.

307
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,375
We should keep our mouths shut,
keep our eyes closed,

308
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,958
and listen only to what we're told to do.

309
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,666
Do you understand?

310
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,583
"Of the three ways of being unfilial,
not bearing a son is the worst."

311
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:39,250
"Having no son is the worst
of the three sins."

312
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,708
You used to teach me that.

313
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,750
I intend to get another wife
for Hai Phuoc.

314
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,916
I hope to soon fulfill my responsibility.

315
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,791
You had better give me the key

316
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:09,041
so I can take over from you
and serve this family.

317
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,333
Please treat this cup of tea
as my announcement.

318
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,625
Drink up.

319
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:18,916
Drink.

320
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,083
Drink.

321
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:35,625
It's mid-autumn,
and the lotus season is about to end.

322
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,791
You should cherish the moments

323
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,583
when you can still enjoy
a cup of tea which I have prepared.

324
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,375
Don't worry.

325
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,083
Hai Phuoc will soon have a son.

326
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,708
And you...

327
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:01,333
had better give me the key.

328
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,416
You're so wrong.

329
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,208
Don't get so angry.

330
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,625
It's not good for your health.

331
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,083
You have to stay healthy.

332
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,166
Open your eyes and see

333
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,333
how I will serve the Huynh family.

334
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,958
Give me the key!

335
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,375
Do you hear me? Do you?

336
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:51,000
Open your eyes and look at my son
and at Bay Loan's son.

337
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,833
See who is better than who.

338
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,833
See who is better than who.

339
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,708
Mr. Hai.

340
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,333
Mr. Hai.

341
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,375
Mr. Hai, where are you?

342
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,916
Mr. Hai.

343
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,041
Mr. Hai.

344
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,125
Mother-in-Law, I'm looking for Mr. Hai.

345
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,708
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

346
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,708
My mother-in-law is tired.
You can talk to me instead.

347
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,083
Then I will wait for her to get better.

348
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,833
I will see her later.

349
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,708
Mrs. Hai Linh is merely a living corpse.
How long do you want to wait?

350
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,166
Do you want to isolate her?

351
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,875
We'll see how long
you can abuse your power.

352
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,750
Damn it!

353
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:59,041
Ba Tran cannot cover the sky
with the palm of her hand.

354
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,458
Don't celebrate too soon.

355
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,041
To be honest,

356
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,583
we are only servants.

357
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,666
Whatever we do
will only benefit our masters.

358
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,958
Guys, rob the mill.

359
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,125
Let's rob!

360
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,750
-What are you doing?
-Rob it!

361
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,500
Stop it!

362
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,875
Chin Ti, you're drunk!

363
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,666
This is so wrong!

364
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,000
Do you want to stop me?

365
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,250
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

366
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,000
Take them all.

367
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,833
Stop it.

368
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,791
Put it down. Stop it.

369
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,791
Drop it.

370
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,250
Mistress!

371
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,666
Mistress, there is chaos in the mill.

372
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,541
They're raiding the mill.

373
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,958
Put it down.

374
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,166
Stop it!

375
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,041
Stop it!

376
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,958
Put it down.

377
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,250
Put it down.

378
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,458
Who organized all of this?

379
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,708
I did!

380
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,791
Who organized this?

381
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,125
Mistress!

382
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,208
Do you want to rebel?

383
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:49,250
-Who told you to rob the mill?
-Well, well...

384
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,500
Chin.

385
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,625
Didn't I tell you to share
the rice with the farmers?

386
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,333
Why didn't you do as I told you?
Now you've caused a riot.

387
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,625
I will share the rice with you.

388
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,166
-But if you try to rob...
-Mistress,

389
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,458
it's all Ba Tung's fault.

390
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:21,000
That's right, Mistress.

391
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,875
Councilor, I'm a bit drunk.

392
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,333
Please forgive me.

393
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:32,166
-Everything was planned by Chin Ti.
-You...

394
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,791
-That's right, Mistress.
-It's all Chin Ti's fault.

395
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,166
I never thought it was you, Chin Ti.

396
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,458
Get out, everyone!

397
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,083
She's the most powerful person.

398
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,666
Is there any chance
she will have Chin Ti killed?

399
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,791
Who knows?

400
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,750
We are relatives, though.

401
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,833
Who's your relative?

402
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,833
The snake hasn’t molted yet.

403
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,208
As long as Mrs. Hai Linh is still alive...

404
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,541
you don't have any chance
to be the head of the Huynh family.

405
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,833
All right.

406
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,291
Such a vicious woman.

407
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,291
Don't think that
I don't know about your wrongdoings.

408
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,416
You don't deserve
to be a part of the Huynh family.

409
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:49,833
Shut up.

410
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,083
I will report you.

411
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,125
You're such a slutty

412
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,041
and vicious woman.

413
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,250
Mistress has come!

414
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,375
-What's happening in there?
-I'm afraid she will punish us all.

415
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,000
Chin Ti died in an accident.

416
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,541
-Remember his example.
-Yes, ma'am.

417
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,375
WINTER

418
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,958
At the end of the lotus season that year,

419
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,125
Ms. Ba Tran found another wife
for Mr. Hai Phuoc

420
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,375
in order to fulfill her responsibility
of providing an heir for the Huynh family.

421
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,291
The new wife is named Tuyet Mai.

422
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,000
Tuyet Mai didn't get a fancy wedding.

423
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,250
She was only welcomed
with a modest ceremony.

424
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,541
Mother-in-Law, Tuyet Mai has arrived.

425
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,041
Hello.

426
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Tuyet Mai, take off your hat
and give me your suitcase.

427
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,583
Yes, please.

428
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,791
We should've had someone to send you here,

429
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,250
but the horoscope master
said not to make it so fancy.

430
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:45,750
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,166
Give your good wishes to your grandmother
and to your mother-in-law Bay Loan.

432
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,625
Hello, Grandmother.
Hello, Mother-in-Law Bay Loan.

433
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:01,958
Hai Phuoc.

434
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,875
Mother.

435
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,500
This is Hai Phuoc.

436
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,708
Hello.

437
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,666
Hi.

438
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,583
This is Tuyet Mai. She'll be your wife.

439
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:25,833
Tuyet Mai.

440
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,541
My wife Tuyet Mai is pretty.

441
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,416
From today, you are officially
a member of the Huynh family.

442
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:40,416
Take your time
and start learning your duties.

443
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,500
But I remind you:

444
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:46,416
you must respect your husband
and dedicate yourself to his family.

445
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,750
And most importantly,
you must give us a grandson soon.

446
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:51,958
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,041
Call me "Mother-in-Law."

448
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,083
Yes, "Mother-in-Law."

449
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,333
-Nanny!
-What?

450
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,875
Ms. Tuyet Mai, Mr. Hai Phuoc's wife,
has just arrived.

451
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,625
She looks modern.

452
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:18,750
Mr. Hai seems to like her very much.

453
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,291
You should watch your mouth.
Go wash the vegetables.

454
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,083
She was talking nonsense.
Please don't take offense.

455
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,583
My mother-in-law asked me to go check
on grandmother's medicine.

456
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,375
It's all done, ma'am.

457
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,750
I heard you went to a private school
in Saigon.

458
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,708
You also have a good family background.

459
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:50,375
Why did you decide to get married
into our family?

460
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,250
I'm not hiding from you.

461
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:58,083
My father killed an officer by accident.

462
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,875
He's in jail now.

463
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:04,000
My mom was so depressed that
she got sick and passed away.

464
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,458
I need some money

465
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,541
to hire a lawyer for my father.

466
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,875
Now, you have been
accepted into this family.

467
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,666
Try to settle down
and live in harmony with others

468
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,416
and to have a son
as your mother-in-law wishes.

469
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,041
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

470
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,250
Tuyet Mai. My wife Tuyet Mai is pretty.

471
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,458
Ouch!

472
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,166
-You may leave.
-Yes.

473
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,583
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

474
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Mother.

475
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,916
Let me give you a bath.

476
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,958
Then you can go see your wife, all right?

477
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,416
Mother! You wet my locust.

478
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,583
Good boy.

479
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,625
Finish your bath,
then go see your pretty wife.

480
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,291
You two should give me a grandson soon.

481
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,750
I don't know how to have children.

482
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,916
I only want to play with my locust.

483
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,958
Please let me go out and play.

484
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,083
-Give me the locust.
-No.

485
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,958
-Give me the locust.
-No.

486
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,500
-Give me the locust.
-Here.

487
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,583
Fine, take it.
This locust can lay eggs, many, many eggs.

488
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,583
Take it! Now get out!

489
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:04,750
-Get out!
-Hai Phuoc!

490
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,208
Don't you understand my concern?

491
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,208
Don't you?

492
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:18,041
If I hadn't tried to keep you,
I would have ended up like this locust...

493
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,500
just a puppet in someone else's hands.

494
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,666
Do you understand my concern now?

495
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,708
Mother.

496
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,791
Mother, don't cry.

497
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,875
I don't want you to turn into a locust.

498
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,000
I love you. I'm finishing my bath.

499
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,708
It will be really quick.

500
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,000
Mother, don't cry.

501
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:08,375
Mother, don't cry. I will finish quickly.

502
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,916
Quickly.

503
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,125
I'm finishing my bath.

504
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,750
Good boy. I love you, son.

505
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,583
Bring it to Mr. Hai
when the ceremony is over.

506
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:52,583
Yes, ma’am!

507
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,041
Mattresses come in pairs

508
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,083
A pair of stalking mattresses

509
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,333
Which are brand new

510
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,166
Help the couple make a baby

511
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,208
-A lot of babies
-Don’t scare, my beautiful wife!

512
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,375
-Tiny little ones
-Don't scare.

513
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,291
Wearing jackfruit leaves

514
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,916
Riding toy horses

515
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,250
One kid after another

516
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:21,375
Keep coming to their mother

517
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,416
Please touch his head for good luck.

518
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:36,083
My beautiful wife, touch his head!

519
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,208
My wife is so pretty.

520
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,416
Your medicine is ready.

521
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,666
I’m not sick.

522
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:04,666
My pretty wife, take it.
Mother will love you.

523
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,458
-No!
-Take it! Take it! Take it!

524
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,208
May you have a good night!

525
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:36,958
Let’s go to bed, honey!

526
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:37,916
OK!

527
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:44,416
My beautiful wife, come here. Next to me.

528
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,000
-Ms. Tu Thi.
-Hurry up.

529
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,166
Did Tuyet Mai drink all the medicine?

530
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,500
Yes, she did.

531
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,125
-What about Mr. Hai?
-He took it, too.

532
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,541
What’s wrong?

533
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,250
What makes you unpleasant?

534
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,458
Mother-in-Law, I am not.

535
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,750
Then go back to your room.

536
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,375
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

537
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,791
-Tu Thi.
-Yes!

538
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,541
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

539
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,708
You may know my intention with Tuyet Mai.

540
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,583
What do you think?

541
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,458
Mother-in-Law, on what you have arranged,

542
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:40,416
I don't dare to comment.

543
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:44,291
I know your feelings,
but this is of the utmost importance.

544
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,875
Yes.

545
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,458
I tried to make it work
between you and Hai Phuoc.

546
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,958
I know you also care about me.

547
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,458
It’s all my fault.

548
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,416
I don’t blame you,

549
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,916
but you should remember
that having no sons

550
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,333
is the worst of the three sins
of being unfilial.

551
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:09,041
It should not happen to Hai Phuoc.

552
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,583
Mother-in-Law, I know.

553
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,375
Excuse me!

554
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,666
Aren't you with Mr. Hai?

555
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,708
He went to see his grandmother.

556
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,875
In the Huynh family,

557
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,375
a daughter-in-law has
to visit Grandmother twice a day.

558
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,625
It’s so complicated here.
It's too difficult to serve them.

559
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,583
Don’t say that.
You will make mother upset.

560
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,125
All right.
I’ll perform my duties starting tomorrow.

561
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,333
I will visit Grandmother twice a day.

562
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,000
I’ll go with you.

563
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,041
I thought I had to go with Mr. Hai.

564
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,000
Sister-in-Law.

565
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,625
Sister-in-Law...

566
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,625
why are you picking
our mother-in-law’s flowers?

567
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,166
These lotus petals are dead.

568
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,000
Mother-in-Law will scold me
if I leave them like this.

569
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:47,708
I thought she would destroy
a whole lake for a single dead petal.

570
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,083
What do you mean?

571
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,833
I mean...

572
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,750
is it true that the Huynh family
only needs a grandson,

573
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,958
not a daughter-in-law?

574
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,458
That's true.

575
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:02,000
In this house, there are many other rules.

576
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,166
If you want to live here comfortably,

577
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,208
watch your words.

578
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:10,458
I’m just telling the truth.

579
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:14,000
You can ignore them
if you don't like it.

580
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,666
-Tuyet Mai.
-Yes.

581
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:24,791
Mother-in-Law told me to show you around.
Come with me.

582
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,458
This is the main house.
The shrine is over here.

583
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,416
This is the reading room.

584
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,333
So our house is here,
and where is the rice mill?

585
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,041
Tell the butler to take you there.

586
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,708
These are all the rooms. However,

587
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,500
don't ever go near the wooden annex
near the lake.

588
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:54,833
Why?

589
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,875
It's deserted and murky.

590
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,958
It's where the daughters-in-law

591
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,208
are punished for violating
the family's rules.

592
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:07,416
Don't forget that!
Don't go there by yourself!

593
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,500
-Mother-in-Law will be unhappy.
-Yes.

594
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,250
The table is ready. Please come in to eat.

595
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:14,666
OK!

596
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,208
-Mistress, meal is ready.
-Yay, food's here.

597
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,458
Let's eat!

598
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:29,958
Yes, Mother-in-Law!

599
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,333
-Where is Tuyet Mai?
-She...

600
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,875
My beautiful wife!

601
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:40,000
-Mother-in-Law!
-Have you been permitted to sit?

602
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,166
It's absurd that
a daughter-in-law needs to be invited,

603
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,000
and the mother-in-law needs
to get approval to dine.

604
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,708
Don't make the same mistake!

605
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,958
Yes, Mother-in-Law. I’m sorry!

606
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,916
My beautiful wife, come here!

607
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,708
My beautiful wife, come here!

608
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,750
Sit down!

609
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,541
-Tu Thi, stay to eat.
-Yes, Mother-in-Law.

610
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,708
Next time, advise your sister-in-law
on our family’s rules.

611
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,625
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

612
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:21,875
Eat.

613
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,666
Let’s eat! Let's eat!

614
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,666
Mother-in-Law!

615
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:01,375
When did you come back?

616
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,583
I just got here!

617
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:06,250
I intended to visit Grandmother
before seeing you.

618
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,333
Tuyet Mai!

619
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,083
-Yes, Mother-in-Law.
-This is Ba Khiem,

620
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,125
your mother-in-law Bay Loan’s son,

621
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,750
your younger brother-in-law.

622
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,541
And this is Tuyet Mai,

623
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,416
your brother’s second wife.

624
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,625
Greet her!

625
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,958
It has been a long time
since our last cup of tea.

626
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,916
I’ve lost my taste for tea since you left.

627
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,083
Mother.

628
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,666
I came back here to...

629
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:22,041
I want you to understand that
whatever happens to me,

630
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,916
you're the only one
the Huynh family can rely on.

631
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:31,250
How long are you going to stay?

632
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,416
I don't know yet.

633
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:43,708
Mother.

634
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,958
How long has Tuyet Mai been here?

635
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,458
Thien Khiem!

636
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,750
You must remember
Tuyet Mai is Hai Phuoc’s wife.

637
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:53,791
She's your elder sister-in-law.

638
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,375
Do you understand?

639
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:26,833
Mother-in-Law.

640
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:33,125
Mother-in-Law.

641
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,875
Why is it taking so long?

642
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,708
Where is Tuyet Mai?

643
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:18,958
Mother-in-Law,

644
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:21,750
Tuyet Mai is resting in her room
because she does not feel well.

645
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,541
So disobedient!

646
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,333
Eat your meal! I’m not feeling well.

647
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,416
Mother-in-Law...

648
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:43,583
I just wanted to come
and see why you couldn’t dine with us.

649
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:47,291
I’m sorry, Mother-in-Law!

650
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,541
I’m feeling unwell.

651
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,125
If you feel sick,

652
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:00,333
stay in the room.
You don’t have to visit your grandmother.

653
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,833
Yes. Thank you, Mother-in-Law.

654
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
My beautiful wife.

655
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,583
Tuyet Mai.

656
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:24,333
Tuyet Mai, my beautiful wife.

657
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:26,958
Stop calling my name like I'm a kid!

658
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,333
Make me a grass locust!

659
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,333
I don't know how to.

660
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,708
You don't know how to,

661
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:39,000
but Tu Thi can do it very well.

662
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:43,083
Then ask her to do it for you.

663
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,750
Do it for me!

664
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,166
I don't know how to!
Go away! Stop annoying me!

665
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,291
You nag at me.

666
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,625
I'll tell my mother!

667
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,250
Mr. Hai Phuoc! Hey!

668
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,583
-Tuyet Mai.
-What are you doing?

669
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:06,958
I want to see you tonight.

670
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,250
We shouldn't.
Mother-in-Law is suspecting us.

671
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,250
I'll wait for you.

672
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:06,666
It's you!

673
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,458
Tuyet Mai.

674
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,458
How can you do this to me?

675
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,000
Tuyet Mai, do you know...

676
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:15,375
I've dropped out of school for months
to look for you.

677
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,333
I'm sorry. I have my own burden.

678
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,250
Ms. Tu Thi.

679
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,083
Why are you so panicked?

680
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:29,833
I saw Mr. Ba Khiem and Ms. Tuyet Mai
sneaking around out back.

681
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,208
Every day, I went to the library
where we first met,

682
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,000
wishing that you weren't gone.

683
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:39,958
Why are you here?

684
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,833
Why have you become Hai Phuoc’s wife?

685
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:48,083
I... think we should stop here.

686
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:04,583
I saw them with my own eyes!

687
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,875
Keep your mouth shut.

688
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,875
My mother-in-law
should not know about this. Understood?

689
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,833
Mother-in-Law, your tea is ready.

690
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,875
Mother-in-Law, are you unsatisfied?

691
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,083
Why is the tea mixed with jasmine?

692
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:43,875
Who brewed the tea?

693
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,458
Mother-in-Law, I boiled the water myself,

694
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,250
washed the pot, and brewed the tea.
I did not assign anyone to do it.

695
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,000
It may be from the jasmine
I picked for Mother-in-Law Bay Loan.

696
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:03,958
Do not ever mix lotus with jasmine.

697
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:07,166
I'm sorry, Mother-in-Law.

698
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:20,416
My beautiful wife! Let's eat.

699
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,833
Mistress, Ms. Tuyet Mai's meal is ready.

700
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:37,125
Tu Thi. Have someone bring it
to Tuyet Mai's room.

701
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,750
-Mother-in-Law.
-You don't have to dine here.

702
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:47,125
Did I do something wrong, Mother-in-Law?

703
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:49,541
Tu Thi!

704
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,000
Yes, ma'am.

705
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,625
-Hai Tho, serve the rice!
-Yes, ma'am.

706
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,625
The wooden annex by the lake

707
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:21,000
is where the daughters-in-law
are punished.

708
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,583
Don't go there by yourself!

709
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:31,083
Dai Dien still needs your help.

710
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,750
Do the best that you can...

711
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:58,458
and you will get well rewarded.

712
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:32,791
Tu Thi!

713
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:40,916
Where are all the servants?
Why are you doing it yourself?

714
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,125
Mother-in-Law is not feeling well.
I want to take care of her.

715
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,083
-What’s in this box?
-Tuyet Mai!

716
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,958
No matter how much the Huynh family
is longing for grandchildren,

717
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,500
you should not be so disobedient.

718
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:04,041
It’s not just me in this house, right?

719
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,041
I don’t understand what you’re saying.

720
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,125
Mother-in-Law!

721
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,125
Mother-in-Law!

722
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,583
I went for a walk last night

723
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,708
and by chance
found your handkerchief near the lake.

724
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,458
Seems that it was blown out there
by the wind.

725
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:54,041
How come you bother to keep
such a small handkerchief.

726
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,583
You are such a good daughter-in-law.

727
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,125
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

728
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:43,041
It turns out that you, Mistress,
are this lustful.

729
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,041
You misbehave!

730
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,291
Who allowed you to enter?

731
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,416
Speaking about misbehaving,

732
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:52,541
you're way beyond that level,
Mother-in-Law.

733
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:54,833
Tuyet Mai!

734
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,375
It’s all my fault, not hers.

735
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,708
You’re such a fool!

736
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,541
This woman will betray anyone.

737
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,166
You think she will spare you?

738
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,791
It smells good.

739
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:21,625
It must be the poisonous black rosemary

740
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:25,541
which can enchant any man

741
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,125
and even the deadliest snake.

742
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,083
You...

743
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:35,291
Ba Tran, you are even eviler
than a poisonous snake.

744
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,666
Go to hell!

745
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,500
Go to hell!

746
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:51,375
Once you use black rosemary,
you absolutely must not bleed.

747
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:55,500
Blood will incite
the snake's aggressiveness.

748
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:56,916
Go to hell!

749
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:41,208
The storm might come to Dai Dien.

750
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,583
You should go as far away as possible.

751
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,041
Mistress!

752
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:53,166
Go anywhere else but here...

753
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,875
and forget everything.

754
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,041
Mistress!

755
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,750
You mean…

756
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:29,083
Mistress!

757
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,166
I’m begging you.

758
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:34,500
Please let me be your servant.

759
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,791
Don't make me go away.

760
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,541
I’ve been doing everything for you
for years...

761
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:55,916
would you just treat me like...

762
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,250
What are you implying?

763
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:10,000
Mistress!

764
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,041
It's my fault.

765
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,291
Please forgive me.

766
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,833
Mistress! I’m begging you.

767
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,125
Please let me be your servant.

768
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:58,375
I'm begging you.

769
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,875
Don't make me go away.

770
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,333
Mistress! I knew you would come.

771
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,833
Mistress...

772
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:12,750
Since you became
Councilor Linh’s daughter-in-law,

773
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:14,208
I know that...

774
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,000
you have never lived in happiness.

775
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:25,041
Why don't you leave
all of your unhappiness here

776
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:30,333
and leave for a place
which no one in Dai Dien knows?

777
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,333
Are you afraid that I'm poisoning you?

778
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,583
Let me.

779
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,458
I will drink it...

780
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:19,166
even if it’s poison.

781
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:35,750
Mistress!

782
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,458
I only have one desire.

783
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:47,375
May I gaze upon your face for once?

784
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:31,083
Hai Dia! Hai Dia, what happened to you?

785
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:36,083
Oh my God, Hai Dia’s dead!

786
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh my God.

787
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:56,541
SPRING

788
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:21,500
Congratulations,
you are now a grandmother.

789
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:43,250
You are carrying a child belonging
to our family. Take good care of yourself.

790
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,541
Yes, Mother-in-Law.

791
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:57,041
Grandmother,

792
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,708
I have done nothing for our family.

793
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,500
It's time for Grandmother
to take her medicine.

794
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:11,625
Sister-in-Law.

795
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,875
Bay Loan is also here?

796
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:21,083
Sister-in-Law,

797
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:25,291
Thien Khiem is visiting our mother-in-law
before he leaves for school.

798
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:27,666
OK.

799
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:29,666
Grandmother!

800
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:33,291
I know this family needs a real man
to handle everything.

801
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,583
I promise I won’t let you down.

802
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,875
Mother-in-Law!

803
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:48,750
Please get well soon
so you can be a great grandmother.

804
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,500
I have good news for you.

805
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,458
Thien Khiem, leave with me.

806
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:58,625
Tu Thi!

807
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,000
Hai Phuoc will soon have a child.

808
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,666
Don’t I deserve...

809
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,041
the heirloom...

810
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:36,000
or you wish for more evil from me? Huh?

811
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:57,916
Thien Khiem!

812
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:03,125
I want you to go back to school tomorrow.

813
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:05,916
Mother, I want to stay here with you.

814
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,291
Just go.

815
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,083
If you love me, don't stay here.

816
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,125
Mother!

817
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:22,666
Why do you have to tolerate everything?

818
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,458
I can bring you away at worst.

819
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,750
Thien Khiem! Don’t ever think that.

820
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:48,791
To be honest...

821
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:51,250
In all of Councilor Linh's family,

822
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:54,750
no one is as good as you.

823
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:01,375
Ms. Bay Loan is so kind,
yet you two can’t live in comfort.

824
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,416
As a man...

825
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:09,291
you shouldn't let your mother
live like a servant.

826
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,583
Honestly, if I were you,

827
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,833
I would make it fair for my mother
by any means.

828
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:35,916
Run away with me.

829
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,500
-No, I can’t.
-I know you love me.

830
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:43,833
-If not, you wouldn’t have come here.
-Khiem.

831
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:46,666
I came here to see you for one last time.

832
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,250
Just want to let you know that
I’m pregnant with Mr. Hai's child.

833
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,541
Stop following me.

834
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,125
Tuyet Mai!

835
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:55,083
You’re lying, aren’t you?

836
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,166
You shouldn’t stay here.

837
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:02,125
We can find to a better place to live.

838
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,208
Trust me, Tuyet Mai.

839
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:08,083
-Come with me, Tuyet Mai.
-I don't want to talk anymore. Just go.

840
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,375
-Tuyet Mai!
-Khiem!

841
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:12,083
Don’t leave me.
Stay here with me, Tuyet Mai.

842
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,458
-Tuyet Mai.
-What are you doing?

843
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:17,958
-I’m begging you. Don’t leave me.
-Let me go!

844
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,458
Mistress...

845
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:31,291
Don’t leave me.

846
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,958
Slap me, but please don’t leave me.

847
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:39,208
Don’t leave me.

848
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:45,041
Bring Bay Loan to the main house
right away!

849
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,416
-You called for me?
-It’s late at night,

850
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:11,291
and you yourself can guess...

851
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:14,250
-Mother-in-Law!
-...what a man and a woman do.

852
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,916
-Thien Khiem!
-Mother, it's all my fault.

853
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:24,125
I wanted you here to see
what your son has done...

854
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,875
Our mother-in-law will demand punishment.

855
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:32,166
For now, let me punish my daughter-in-law.

856
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:34,708
-Bring me a pair of scissors!
-Mother-in-Law!

857
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,083
-Mother-in-Law!
-Shut up!

858
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,000
-Mother-in-Law!
-Thien Khiem!

859
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:38,125
-Mother-in-Law, please. It’s my fault!
-Cutting off your hair,

860
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
applying lime on is not enough
for your sin.

861
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,208
Stop calling me "Mother-in-Law"!

862
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:45,041
Mother-in-Law, please. I'm begging you!

863
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:48,083
Mother-in-Law, it’s my fault.

864
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,250
-Please spare her.
-Mother-in-Law!

865
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:57,625
Ba Tran!

866
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,208
-You are way out of line.
-Insolent!

867
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,375
Sister-in-Law, I’m begging you.

868
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,625
Please forgive him.

869
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:12,958
I'll take all the punishments.

870
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,708
Please forgive him.

871
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,250
Punish me instead.

872
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:20,875
Mother, you don’t have to do it!
Let me take you away from here.

873
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:23,250
Don't stay here! Just leave this house!

874
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,041
Be quiet! Go away!

875
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:31,250
Sister-in-Law, I beg you.
Please spare Thien Khiem.

876
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:32,750
-I will...
-Let me go!

877
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,208
Grab him!

878
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,708
What are you doing?

879
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:42,500
-Isn't it enough for you?
-I beg you.

880
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:43,916
I'll never leave with you, never!

881
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,541
Go! Stay away from me!

882
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:51,333
-Tuyet Mai!
-Thien Khiem!

883
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,958
Shall I die here?

884
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,375
Go! Go!

885
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,041
-Mother!
-Go!

886
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,250
-Go!
-Why, Mother?

887
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:05,666
Go!

888
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,541
Fight for ourselves!

889
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,916
Fight for ourselves!

890
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,250
Take them all!

891
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,791
Everyone, take as many you can

892
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:24,166
and fight for what we deserve.

893
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,541
Let's fight for what we deserve!

894
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,416
Mother, I'm back to take you away!

895
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,125
Mother!

896
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:52,208
Mother...
Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother...

897
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,916
What happened? Mother!

898
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,458
Mother!

899
01:25:58,750 --> 01:25:59,708
Mother!

900
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:04,500
Mother! I have killed you!

901
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:10,750
Mother, please wake up!

902
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:15,208
Mother!

903
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:20,958
Mother!

904
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:22,791
Mother!

905
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,041
Mother!

906
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:28,250
You are OK, aren’t you?

907
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:33,875
Mother, let me brush your hair.

908
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:35,708
I’ll behave.

909
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,291
I'll go to school. I'll go to Saigon.

910
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:41,041
I won’t argue with you.

911
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:46,416
Mother!

912
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,208
Mother!

913
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:52,125
Mother, please wake up!

914
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:56,416
Mother, I've killed you!

915
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:11,250
Mother-in-Law, please let me explain!

916
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:14,166
-It’s not what you think.
-Shut up!

917
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,625
Drink it and leave!

918
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,583
Give it to her!

919
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:20,083
No! Let me go!

920
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:21,333
You can't do it!

921
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,916
I’ll keep my child.

922
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:27,500
Why do you want to kill your grandchild?

923
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,000
You’ll never see him again!

924
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:30,375
See him?

925
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:32,875
Even his father doesn’t dare
to stay here for him.

926
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:34,000
He is a bastard child!

927
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,750
You know who his father is!

928
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:41,541
It’s a pity that I don’t need a grandson
born from a whore like you.

929
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:43,458
You disgrace him.

930
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:44,791
You think you're so pure?

931
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:47,541
Give me her medicine.

932
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,708
Give it to me.

933
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:58,208
Stay away from me!

934
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,875
Let me go.

935
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:06,041
Don’t hurt my baby.
I’m begging you, please spare him.

936
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:09,291
You can’t leave with your child!

937
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:10,958
You disgrace this family.

938
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:15,541
-Stand still! You can’t run away from me.
-Mother!

939
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,666
Mother!

940
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,500
-Mother!
-Mr. Hai!

941
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:25,708
Spare her! Don’t kill my beautiful wife!

942
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,000
Hai Phuoc!

943
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:29,125
She doesn’t deserve you.

944
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,833
Tell me, who are you?

945
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,500
I’m Ba Tran’s son,

946
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:42,250
heir to the Huynh family.

947
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:44,458
Good. Grab her!

948
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:49,375
-Stay away from me!
-Mr. Hai!

949
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:53,458
I’m Tuyet Mai’s husband
and the baby’s father!

950
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,208
Stay away from me! Go away!

951
01:28:56,291 --> 01:29:00,125
Hai Phuoc, calm down. Listen to me.

952
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:04,000
Put the scissors down.
I’ll do whatever you want.

953
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,625
-Put them down!
-Mr. Hai!

954
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:08,791
Hai Phuoc, put the scissors down!

955
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:12,208
-She wants to kill our baby.
-Hai Phuoc!

956
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:15,000
-Mr. Hai!
-Put the scissors down.

957
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:25,875
Mother, I'm hurt!

958
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,916
-Hai Phuoc!
-It hurts.

959
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,333
Stop!

960
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,500
Mr. Hai...

961
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:48,791
Tuyet Mai, where are you going?

962
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:50,416
Tu Thi!

963
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:54,916
How come you look so exhausted?

964
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:11,791
You look so pale.

965
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,083
You need some medicine.

966
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:22,416
Medicine… no! What medicine?

967
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,250
I don’t want it!

968
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:31,083
-It’s yours, Tuyet Mai.
-No!

969
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:36,083
You can't kill our family's heir.

970
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:42,833
You know, not having a son is the worst
of the three unfilial sins.

971
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,000
No! What are you doing?

972
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,250
-You're right.
-No.

973
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:57,708
Not having a son is the worst
of the three unfilial sins...

974
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:03,583
-but incest, betraying your husband...
-No!

975
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,083
...and disgracing the family’s morals
are grounds for the death penalty.

976
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:20,000
Open the door!

977
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:28,291
Tu Thi, the servants are all
waiting for your command.

978
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:33,458
Tell them to follow our plan.

979
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:40,125
Fight! Fight!

980
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,291
Mother!

981
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,666
Hai Phuoc!

982
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:54,375
-Mother!
-Hai Phuoc!

983
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:57,958
It hurts.

984
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,458
It hurts.

985
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:10,291
You will be all right.
I’ll find someone to save you.

986
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,416
It hurts, Mother.

987
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:15,875
Mother.

988
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:19,791
I love you.

989
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,583
Please don’t cry, Mother.

990
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:27,208
I'll be nice.
I won’t make you angry anymore.

991
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:30,291
I'm a good boy.

992
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:35,333
I’m good. I remember,

993
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:41,625
"I’m Ba Tran’s son...

994
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:47,125
heir to the Huynh family."

995
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,958
Mother, don’t cry!

996
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:57,541
I love you.

997
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,458
Hai Phuoc!

998
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,000
Hai Phuoc!

999
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:40,291
Fight! Fight!

1000
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,708
Fight! Fight!

1001
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:45,916
Fight! Fight!

1002
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:48,791
Mother.

1003
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:58,166
Mother...

1004
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:55,166
Every mother-in-law has been
a daughter-in-law once.

1005
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,416
Just like you,

1006
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,458
I was born and raised by my family,

1007
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,916
then had to serve another.

1008
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:11,791
I spent my entire youth to love
and serve my husband wholeheartedly.

1009
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:17,541
I bitterly left everything behind
and stepped into a new house

1010
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:21,916
where few can overcome the prejudice.

1011
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,791
I don't want to pressure you

1012
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,958
to do things that
I myself was also afraid to do.

1013
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,375
Those things include the duty
to give birth to a son

1014
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:37,750
and the obligation to share our love
with another woman.

1015
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:43,083
That prejudice has never changed.

1016
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:49,000
One day, daughters-in-law
will become mothers-in-law.
