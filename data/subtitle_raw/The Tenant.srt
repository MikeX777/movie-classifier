EVARISTO GONZÁLEZ
NURSE PRACTITIONER

2
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,744
- Morning.
- Morning.

3
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,392
Good morning, don Evaristo!

4
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,520
Morning, Mrs. Daniela!

5
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,958
Well? Find an apartment yet?

6
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,920
No. I mean, well, I'm on it.

7
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:37,584
If there weren't so many of us...
my apartment's small, you know.

8
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:40,368
Yeah, well, anyway, thank you.
Good morning to you.

9
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:42,096
Not much to find...!

10
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:00,048
Everyone off! We're here.

11
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,448
Boss, look, look!

12
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:09,744
No good. This place
will come with a surprise.

13
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:13,488
Well surprise or no surprise,
we have a demolition order.

14
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,888
You, notify the inspector!

15
00:04:15,984 --> 00:04:19,920
Move it! Unload the stuff!

16
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:23,184
No, no, no!

17
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,680
Yes, yes.

18
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,504
Of course...

19
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Yes...

20
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,088
- Of course.
- Shine'em up, don Evaristo?

21
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,296
Not today, I'm in a big hurry.

22
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:38,832
I only came to make a call.

23
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,212
Aurora is making up with Manuel...

24
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:44,700
No shoeshines on Sunday for me.
Userita and I have a bull fight.

25
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,896
And from there on to the big time.

26
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,432
Here's my manager.

27
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,232
- Jimenez, at your service.
- Pleased to meet you.

28
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,768
Of course...

29
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:56,304
Right.

30
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,936
Forget it.

31
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,408
Pour me another one.
- Isn't today the deadline

32
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,384
for the demolition?
- I have to sort it out today.

33
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:08,688
Come on, girl!
The gentleman's in a hurry.

34
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,592
So what! Can't a girl talk
with whomever she wants?

35
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,556
It's a question of life and death.

36
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,252
It's just that...
It's for an apartment, you know?

37
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:19,424
Hang up for a moment,
Manolo, an optimist needs the phone.

38
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,128
Thank you, miss,
it's only a matter of seconds.

39
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:23,760
Ah, that's all we need.

40
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:30,192
Madruga Agency? Mr. Madruga?

41
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm Gonzalez, nice to meet you.

42
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,224
No, the guy for the apartment.

43
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,024
Yes, yes.

44
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,328
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,112
Well, but...

46
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,320
Ah, right...

47
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,720
So, then?

48
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Right, right.

49
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,848
Yes, yes.

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,344
Right away. Right aw...

51
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,312
"Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. No, no."

52
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:06,000
And then they talk about women.

53
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,976
These men,
if we were to listen to them...

54
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:14,544
What about today's ads? Any hope?

55
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,712
But, Don Evaristo, why are you so calm?

56
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:20,496
The demolition men
are entering your building!

57
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
Can I help you?

58
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:31,248
Ma'am, I'm very sorry
but you have to leave the house.

59
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:32,880
We've come to demolish it.

60
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,816
Excuse me.
Excuse me, excuse me!

61
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,494
Don't worry, I'll try to fix it.

62
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,712
Come on, leave me with these gentlemen.

63
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,884
I know you're right,

64
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,368
but she doesn't
know today's the deadline.

65
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:53,040
If I could have a few more days...
- You've already had six months.

66
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,632
I'm not arguing, the law's on your side.

67
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,360
And that's that.

68
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:00,432
I only ask for the
children, the four of them.

69
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,416
It's just a couple of days.
- Everybody's got children

70
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:05,640
and if you're going
to make exceptions...

71
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:09,088
Look, we can't waste any time,
the crew's here as you can see.

72
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:16,944
Dad, mom says to come in.
- Come on, kids, don't get in the way.

73
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,768
Go inside, go inside.

74
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:23,088
Dad, those men are bad,
hit'em hard, make'em cry.

75
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:26,064
No, child, they're not bad,
they also have children,

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,944
they have to follow orders.
Run along inside.

77
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,672
Come on, inside!

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,896
Come on, move it.

79
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:43,920
If it's only a couple of days,
we could go faster later and...

80
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,648
What do you think?

81
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:48,912
I don't like being conned.
Why should I pay the piper?

82
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:51,216
There you go.
- Give me a few hours,

83
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,616
just enough time to talk to the owner.

84
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:56,020
I'll give them to you!
You have until noon.

85
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:59,864
You should know better. If you're
in breach, don't come crying later.

86
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:01,968
Thank you very much.

87
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,464
On behalf of the children I thank you.

88
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,832
For the sake of not harming
you and the children, I thought...

89
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:10,896
we could start here,
we've got half a day's work to do.

90
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,880
This way we can start
and the tenant's out of the way,

91
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:16,560
Not a bad idea.
- Since when do you think?

92
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,576
A bunch of brave philosophers.

93
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:21,072
And, you, hurry up because at noon...

94
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,704
Yes, yes. Thank you.

95
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,504
What? Did you fix it?
- Yeah, didn't you hear?

96
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,808
Thank God.
- Thanks to the workers, who

97
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:33,264
are sisters of charity,
we have a home until two o'clock.

98
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
But where is the 10 cc syringe?

99
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:38,448
How strange and sudden!
Was there no warning?

100
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:42,864
You didn't know it was today?

101
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,360
Safe and sound,
it was the German syringe..

102
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:48,816
Come on, kids,
I've already got too much stuff on me.

103
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,724
Pack light, we’ll have to scram.

104
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:53,424
You have to see the landlord.
- And tell him what?

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,304
Cry him a river.
Can't you find the reason?

106
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:58,896
The same goes for you,
don't go poking buttocks.

107
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,180
And eat what later?
I have to see Madruga,

108
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,572
he promised to find me
an apartment, we have to buy time.

109
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,096
Come on, no time for naps.

110
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:10,128
You knew this, you knew it was today.
- Come on, come on, wash up.

111
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:11,856
What if Madruga fails you?

112
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,216
You don't know him.
He's a serious man, you know?

113
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,904
You'll see how it all works out.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,496
Don't you trust your hubby?

115
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:23,264
Dad, I'm not washing my face today.

116
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,352
Your father is your
father, child, go, go!

117
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,352
We are men too.

118
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,576
Who'll take care of these jewels?

119
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,976
I'll call a neighbor.
- No way Daniela,

120
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,472
I can't stand her.
- You take care of Madruga,

121
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:37,104
the rest is my business.

122
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,312
Poor children.

123
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:44,688
Come on, don't despair, be confident.

124
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,728
Wake up, you nutcase!

125
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,008
Mrs. Colasa, please, I'm in a hurry.

126
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:52,944
Did you bring those ads from agencies?
- We're looking for an apartment.

127
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:55,536
Buy a comic book, at least you'll laugh.

128
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,992
I know a serious agency,
I could recommend it to you.

129
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:02,064
You don't need agencies
to find expensive apartments,

130
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:03,400
there are plenty of them.

131
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,100
I don't suppose
you'd want an apartment like that.

132
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,192
No, ma'am, no way, I asked the agency

133
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,624
for one of about 200 or 250 pesetas..

134
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:29,520
The chard is in the cooler,
you'll have to wash it again

135
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:32,688
due to the dust.
You go about your business, don't worry,

136
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,416
that's what I'm here for.

137
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,736
Don't make it hard for Daniela.
- You have to be nice to me.

138
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,424
because if not...
Come on, hurry up, don't dawdle.

139
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,992
Go hard on the
landlord, he's got a boat.

140
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:47,264
If it wasn't for you, I don't
know how I would have managed.

141
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,472
This is where your
husband should step in.

142
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:52,656
They burden a woman with
children and when you need them...

143
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:55,728
Just between you
and me, no surprise here.

144
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,804
Yes, Evaristo got this one wrong,

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,996
but I'm sure it was just
to spare me the unpleasantness.

146
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,408
Just like my Genaro,
that's how he started.

147
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,920
No, no, my husband is incapable of...
- Men are deceitful, Marta,

148
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:10,208
Why didn't he warn you?
Because if you start snooping around...

149
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,680
you were bound to find something.
- He said he already found one,

150
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,656
a certain Madruga promised him.
- And you bought it?

151
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:20,024
You'll see Madruga flunk,
and then it's every man for himself.

152
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,904
You with the children
and the slacker running around,

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,980
just like my Genaro.
- He's different, he loves children.

154
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:28,080
Besides, we're in love.

155
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:30,960
Did your husband come back?
- After 20 years

156
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:32,592
and drunk as a skunk!

157
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:35,484
No, child, no, it wasn't
necessary to embalm him.

158
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:47,567
DON'T RELY ON CHANCE
FIND YOUR APARTMENT IN MADRUGA

159
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:52,820
WANT AN APARTMENT? MADRUGA
A HOME? MADRUGA. NEED TO FIND? MADRUGA

160
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,416
Good morning, friend!

161
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,432
Come on in, come on in!

162
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:03,504
You know I never tire
of greeting you, Mr. Gutiérrez.

163
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,680
Gonzalez, Evaristo Gonzalez.
I'm here about the apartment,

164
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,744
I called you a while ago and...
- Of course, my Gutiérrez,

165
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,828
you don't know how sorry I am,
you know how serious I am.

166
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,704
We look for apartments
for everyone, we look and look.

167
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,440
We seek but, oh, to find!
It's the country you live in, my friend.

168
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:21,648
Except for Eldorado...

169
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,104
Well, how about my 25 pesetas?

170
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,736
But what about paperwork?

171
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,136
And the twists and turns?

172
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,632
The ups and the downs?
The comings and goings?

173
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,824
Bringing and bearing?
Giving and taking?

174
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:36,816
You told me to come...
- Of course, my friend Gutierrez,

175
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:40,464
clients are never abandoned here.
Do you need it urgently?

176
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,248
Totally!
- I get it, my friend, I get it.

177
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,116
There's been an unfortunate
mistake and I apologize.

178
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:49,454
So there is an apartment?
- We have charged you the slow rate,

179
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,660
it's inexcusable, unforgivable!
But everything can be fixed.

180
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,368
An additional 100 pesetas
and I'll fast-track you.

181
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:58,128
As you wish, sir,
but we'll have to be patient.

182
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,916
Did you ever hear of Saint Job?
- Yes, sir, but I...

183
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,080
Do you distrust me?
- No, for heaven's sake, Mr. Madruga.

184
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,152
You know I am a serious man,
trustworthiness is my motto,

185
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,744
honesty to the letter.
Don't say a word.

186
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,200
I know you want your money,
yes, I'm reading it on your face.

187
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:15,696
Well...
- I'll show you who Madruga is,

188
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,484
I can't be beaten for reliability.
Here's the money.

189
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,600
Can't you break 1000 pesetas?

190
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,380
No? Then, sorry, friend,
come along some other day.

191
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,776
I have so much work;
apartments, apartments!

192
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,504
Everybody wants apartments.

193
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,192
So long, Mr. Gutiérrez, so long.

194
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:32,208
Excuse me, I have a lot of work.

195
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,236
Goodbye, Mr. Gutierrez, goodbye.

196
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:24,144
You've already seen
that the Marquis has been reasonable.

197
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,216
My congratulations.
- We both made a good deal.

198
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:30,356
With men like the Marquis
and companies like ours,

199
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:32,784
our nation goes
from strength to strength.

200
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:35,184
Where do you want me to send the gift?

201
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,256
I'll take care of it.
Good morning to you.

202
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,560
It was a pleasure.

203
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:50,064
Would you like to see the Marquis?

204
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,984
Do you have an appointment?

205
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,072
Would you prefer to deal with me?
I'm his administrator.

206
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,744
You see, I'm a tenant,
well, my husband is.

207
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:01,488
The house on Pino street,
the one they've started to tear down.

208
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:04,368
Yes, I know, today was the deadline.

209
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,824
Marcial, hey, Marcial,

210
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,936
What street is that?

211
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:14,064
What does that woman want?

212
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,808
It's about a tenant,

213
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:20,492
who lived precisely in that street.

214
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,096
- Ah...
- Still live there, with four children.

215
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,060
Can I be of any help to you?
- You certainly can, sir.

216
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm just asking for a break,
two or three days at the most.

217
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,592
As far as I'm concerned,
although I don't quite understand...

218
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:35,280
On behalf of my children,
God bless you, sir.

219
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:38,348
Saint Rita has heard me,
all the way I pleaded with her.

220
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,560
"Saint Rita, advocate of the impossible,

221
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:43,056
make the landlord's heart soften".

222
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:46,416
Sure, they can say it was
because you're a good man.

223
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:49,910
So can we stay?
- The thing is, ma'am,

224
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,848
that the Marquis here,
despite his good wishes...

225
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:56,688
- And I do wish good.
- He cannot do anything about it.

226
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,144
You've heard Marcial, he knows...

227
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:03,504
But if you agree,
I don't see who can prevent it.

228
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,056
The new owners, the Marquis
is no longer the owner of the house.

229
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,624
Indeed, indeed.
We just sold one.

230
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,008
I have so many, I don't know
which one it is or where it is,

231
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:14,736
but when Marcial says so...

232
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,424
Give her the address of the new owners,

233
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,404
the gentlemen from Mundis
or whatever they're called.

234
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:24,432
Alberto, call for the car, I have
to go celebrate I don't know what.

235
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,736
Ah, yes, the sale of, uh...!

236
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,064
It's funny, of all the places I own...

237
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,080
It had to be hers, poor woman.

238
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,688
Look, Marcial, look, and tell me
if you see women like this today.

239
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:04,944
What a time, Marcial, what a time.
Back then it was a pleasure to live.

240
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,208
#The "Pepsico"

241
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,032
#I didn't try

242
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:15,312
#and to scotch I say "nen".

243
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,320
#And if my lingerie...

244
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,036
Come in, González.
- Hi, Lola.

245
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,224
My my, you're in a hurry.
- ¿Ever had your house demolished?

246
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,912
For Heaven's sake!
- Well, live and learn.

247
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,504
They're demolishing mine today.
- ¡Barbarians!

248
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,424
The law is on their side.

249
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,784
Unless the Good Lord
intercedes we'll sleep out tonight..

250
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
With three kids.
- No, four; two boys and two girls.

251
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,776
You still have time to practice.

252
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,792
If you don't mind, I'll...

253
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:45,952
I have to keep track.
There's over two hundred of them.

254
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:48,144
Ready, maestro?

255
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:54,480
#I'm from Madrid,

256
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,496
#Cool, right?
- Is that Alfonso?

257
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,320
Listen, Alfonso, it's Evaristo.

258
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,816
When I left, they were alive.

259
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:03,120
A trifle, they're tearing down my house.

260
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,616
Yes, man, the house!

261
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,496
But it's the very
city council that mandated it.

262
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,032
Tells me to report it!

263
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:11,952
What rights are you talking about?

264
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:14,832
Hey, didn't you have
a cousin married to an officer?

265
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:16,868
It's just that without sponsors...

266
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,632
Right.

267
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,456
I'm sorrier.

268
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,528
Anyway... You can say that again.

269
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,640
A hug, Alfonso.

270
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,280
#I'm from Madrid,

271
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,968
#cool, isn't it?

272
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:42,864
#Well, I'm not "Americanized" yet.

273
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,936
#I don't dance "swing",

274
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,144
#nor do the cha-cha-cha,

275
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,656
#I prefer the real chotis.

276
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,152
#The "Pepsicó"

277
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,744
#I didn't try

278
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:02,448
#and to scotch I say "nen".

279
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,848
#If my lingerie

280
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,516
#is made of silk,

281
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:11,472
#It's nylon, so what do you see?

282
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:15,024
Well, look, I mean...
Listen, I'm calling about the ad.

283
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:18,192
Yes, about those
rooms with kitchen rights.

284
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,552
Four of them.

285
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:26,552
But they're four little
angels who don't make trouble!

286
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,328
Wha...?

287
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:33,744
Dogs, yes, but no children!
Raise kids and this happens!

288
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,640
#The "Pepsicó"

289
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,656
#I didn't try

290
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:45,360
#and to scotch I say "nen".

291
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,336
#If my lingerie...

292
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,192
Ouch!

293
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:02,256
You'd be priceless as a bull picador.

294
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:05,232
Sorry, Lola, today is just a bad day...

295
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,400
If I had money,
but I have nothing but my work.

296
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,144
Well, Lola, all the best
and I'll see you on Judgement Day.

297
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,680
Wait, Gonzalez.

298
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:16,272
You're an honest man, it's plain to see.

299
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:19,824
Seriously, I have
savings and you need money, so...

300
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,032
No way, I'm a gentleman.

301
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:23,644
But you can't eat that.

302
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:26,448
It would be an
investment just like any other.

303
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,136
Well, if you put it that way...
- Of course,

304
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,632
if you don't take it, my boyfriend will.

305
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,648
when he gets out of jail.
- Damn!

306
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:36,912
Life, Gonzalez.
Think about it and let me know.

307
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:40,368
Since it's an investment,
I'll have to consult with the missus.

308
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:43,824
Anyway, thank you very much.
Better this way, Pepote is jealous

309
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,676
and it could get complicated.
- I have enough on my plate. Goodbye.

310
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,024
Have you been waiting long?
- Yes.

311
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,656
A little bit.

312
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:11,184
Here for a claim, of course.
- Yes.

313
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,296
Pretty sloppy, I say.

314
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,296
- Right?
- Yes.

315
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,192
And considering this...

316
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:19,824
- Right?
- Yeah.

317
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,232
Come on, follow me,
there's no time to lose.

318
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:32,780
Excuse me, can somebody help me?
They're tearing down my house.

319
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:35,568
That's a problem for
the manager, you have to wait.

320
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:38,544
There's a very important board meeting.

321
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:41,616
Gentlemen, this way,
the board is expecting you.

322
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:52,080
And this, members
of the board, is the curve.

323
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:55,248
Did I say curve? I mean straight!
Very straight line!

324
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,896
A very vertical line of our profits

325
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:02,160
during the current fiscal year.

326
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,696
So it is!

327
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:10,224
In a few moments our
chairman of the board

328
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,912
will make a stunning
and epic announcement

329
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:17,328
regarding our company.
Let us wait for such a solemn moment

330
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:20,016
with a glass of
Spanish wine in our hands.

331
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,992
Bravo!

332
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:37,296
Ah, thank you very much,
miss, are you new in the house?

333
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:39,984
Well...
Shorthand typist, perhaps? Thanks.

334
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,672
Very kind, young lady,
frankly delightful.

335
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:45,744
If you'll excuse me,
I'm looking for the manager.

336
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,392
Don't worry about the manager now,
try one of these with cream.

337
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:52,656
Board members, just a minute!

338
00:23:57,072 --> 00:24:00,912
These two you see here are our workers.

339
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:04,464
I can affirm that as CEO.

340
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,576
And the instruments are ours?

341
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:09,264
Yes, gentlemen, the tools too.

342
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,144
Fantastic! Simply fantastic!

343
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:14,640
Please, I... Gentlemen of the board,

344
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:17,808
you're going to see
a practical demonstration of my idea.

345
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,016
Get the package.

346
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:22,896
Let's see, let those
brave laborers follow me.

347
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:24,624
What's going on?

348
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,984
Behold, gentlemen,
the symbol of destruction!

349
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
The pick! Come on, hit hard.

350
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:43,728
Man...

351
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:46,704
- Come on? What are you waiting for?
- I'll wreck it.

352
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,720
- 25 pesetas says no.
- You're on!

353
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,792
Ah!

354
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:57,168
- Oh...!
- Not so hard.

355
00:24:57,264 --> 00:25:00,816
Look, sir, it's urgent.
- Just a moment. I'll let you know.

356
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,696
And, now, the symbol
of construction, the shovel.

357
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,096
5 pesetas in case I don't get the job.

358
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:08,016
Come on, hurry up. Please...

359
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,592
Only you can help me;
four waiting children...

360
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:13,772
and the demolition has begun.
- What are you talking about?

361
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:16,368
These gentlemen are waiting.
Open the package.

362
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:17,904
There is no time to lose.

363
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,312
Ah, come on, come on.

364
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
Did you see that?
The symbol of construction!

365
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:38,448
Oh!

366
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:43,248
And this will be,
gentlemen, the badge of our company.

367
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,756
- Magnificent.
- Allow me to hug you!

368
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,576
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!

369
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,400
- Quite right, dear.
- Goodbye.

370
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:58,608
Could someone please help me?

371
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:02,064
You were superb,
and the sandwiches were very tasty.

372
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,096
- Most eloquent!
- For God's sake, it was nothing!

373
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:08,880
Please,
they're tearing down my house.

374
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,992
Can't you stop it, please?

375
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:14,232
But aren't you an employee?
Anyway, good job.

376
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,704
They're knocking down my house
and I was coming to ask you to...

377
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,400
Talk to the manager,
he'll be happy to help you.

378
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,268
I can't tell you how
sorry I am, but I can't decide,

379
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:26,736
I have no authority to do so.
- There must be someone who can...

380
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,852
Someone with greater authority.

381
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:31,424
There you have it,
the board of directors

382
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,456
are the only ones who can help,

383
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:36,336
but they won't meet
again for another month.

384
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:38,832
Too bad you didn't come a little sooner.

385
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:43,056
Hats off, gentlemen,
and open your eyes wide,

386
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:45,744
before you the
Mundis-Jauja neighborhood,

387
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,064
with easy and bountiful living,
with marvelous apartments.

388
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,616
Because our apartments
don't cost five million,

389
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,208
not four, not three, not two, not one...

390
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:59,184
Not even the measly
figure of 999,000 pesetas!

391
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:02,640
Say, you don't
have a ticket, do you, sir?

392
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:04,944
Huh? Oh, yes,
- Five pesetas, please.

393
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,264
Thank you. Thank you very much.

394
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,120
Get off, gentlemen, get off.

395
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,904
Welcome to the
neighborhood of Mundis-Jauja!

396
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:28,176
Sir, you've just made your fortune.

397
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:32,112
Imagine that all
sorrows are over for you.

398
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,896
Long live life, sir!
An apartment in Mundis-Jauja

399
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:38,064
is a gold mine. Lucky you, a tenant!

400
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,424
Sir, you can't imagine
what you're getting into.

401
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,240
Well, this is of no importance.

402
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,336
As soon as it works for two months...

403
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:52,248
Lean on me, lean on me. See?

404
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:55,828
As soon as it's working for two
months it'll be as smooth as silk.

405
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,760
These Mundis apartments
are unique, wonderful, superlative.

406
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:01,392
You'll see, you'll see...

407
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:03,408
You see? It's a piece of cake.

408
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,632
Very easy.

409
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:11,376
Just a question of turning carefully...

410
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,200
Very gently.

411
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:16,176
Because, in addition, our apartments

412
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:20,496
are exempt from
duties and stamps, you know?

413
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:23,184
It's great, it's...
Oh, it's really great!

414
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,064
Really, really great!

415
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,656
G-r-e-a...!
Watch out!

416
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:32,592
See? Didn't I tell you?
See how easy it is?

417
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:36,240
Come right on in, sir,
you can consider it yours!

418
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,776
Come in, come in!

419
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:41,904
There's nothing like brand new,
my friend. Look, all top quality.

420
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,264
We have them in many prices,
everyone a bargain.

421
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,392
Do you want a four-bedroom?
With a down payment of 60000 pesetas

422
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:52,640
and 800 every month for
30 years, the apartment is yours.

423
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:54,672
All in all, a pittance. You want a...?

424
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:59,952
Just a hinge issue,
a little touch-up and it'll be fine.

425
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:02,160
Do you want a six-room?

426
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:04,944
Sure, 80,000 and 900 per month..
Just a pittance.

427
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,480
A pittance!

428
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:10,032
Go ahead and open it,
just feel at home!

429
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:13,392
But no, no, you.
But for God's sake!

430
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:16,368
Well, these doors
last forever, huh? Yeah.

431
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,320
That's something, right?

432
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,336
It's the habit. Come in, come in.

433
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,120
Come in and feel at home.

434
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:29,904
I've already told you.
Just feel at home!

435
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:35,760
So? What do you think?
Oh...

436
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:38,160
Well, try it yourself, try it.

437
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:41,232
No, no, you...
But it's so easy!

438
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,016
The ones on top are the shower.
- Yes.

439
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:47,280
The middle ones are
the bathtub. Bathtub...

440
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:49,680
Shower.

441
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:51,696
Confess! I bet you thought

442
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,904
it was going to be the other way around?

443
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,032
Actually, I think I'm
a little far away, you know?

444
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,764
For God's sake, don't say that!

445
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,116
With modern transportation
distance is not a problem nowadays.

446
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:06,384
You know... We have
some with other types of bathrooms,

447
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,860
90,000 down and a thousand a month.

448
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:12,824
I told you it's too much for me.
- Wait a minute! What about the kitchen?

449
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:15,888
Wonderful! Very spacious!
Great modern kitchen!

450
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:19,536
Here you can control the kitchen
without fear of getting in the way

451
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:23,376
of your wife, or your children.
Listen, this is a real bargain.

452
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,568
Well, no, I don't think so...

453
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:29,040
What do you mean, no?
Listen, it's the company's loss.

454
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,920
Don't you think that
90,000 down and 1000 per month

455
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:34,608
for 30 years is an amazing price?

456
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:37,776
I'm sorry...
- No, no, wait, you wait.

457
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:40,944
Here, it's all solid construction.

458
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,824
Just see for yourself.
- But...

459
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,624
Hey, listen, the best is yet to come!

460
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:21,264
It's all been useless: Your lovely
gesture, my entreaties, everything.

461
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,816
Don't worry,
we won't bother you any longer.

462
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:28,560
We'll take our stuff down
and put our trust in God.

463
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:31,036
Come on, what are you waiting for?

464
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,256
Hurry up and demolish
so that your masters

465
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:36,540
can build another one
and sell the apartments for a million.

466
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:39,216
Madam, we don't...
Don't give me small talk!

467
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:42,096
Come on, as we agreed!
Let's all get to work!

468
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,880
Come on, let's get that
down there! You guys too!

469
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:47,472
Come on, man, come on, don't waste time.

470
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:50,352
As fast as turtles!
Come on, come on!

471
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:53,616
Faster!
Watch out for that trunk, you!

472
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:57,072
Hey, come on, don't fall asleep!

473
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,624
And you! You'll break
that glass! Watch out!

474
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,928
Where are you taking my things?

475
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,600
We're moving you
to the ground floor, get it?

476
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:08,592
Whoa, whoa, lazybones, faster!

477
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:11,760
So, while we're
demolishing towards the top,

478
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:14,544
you have time to look for a place to go.

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,096
You think you won't work
just because you can talk?

480
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:20,400
Come on, lazybones! I'll get you to

481
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:24,048
make up for lost time;
we have children too.

482
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:27,120
Come on, man, come on, get to work now!

483
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:29,808
Your feet are heavy
as if you were carrying lead!

484
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:32,016
Children, here comes mommy!

485
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:36,432
- They're good men, Mom!
- Yes, yes.

486
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:01,104
From the last to the first,
you didn't expect that, huh?

487
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:04,368
What do you think?
We're moving you for free.

488
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:09,552
Hey, Marta, Look Marta!

489
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,696
You got it, didn't you?

490
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:17,332
Tell me we have an apartment.

491
00:33:17,424 --> 00:33:19,920
Madruga failed, right?
Just like my Genaro.

492
00:33:20,016 --> 00:33:23,760
You're a lucky guy,
but stay out of the way.

493
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:26,736
Come on, kids, let go. Daddy's tired.

494
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:29,424
And, apparently,
he's going to take a cold shower.

495
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,824
Goodbye, people, tell your mother

496
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,896
that if she needs me
for anything, which she will,

497
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:37,680
she knows where she can find me.
Goodbye, people!

498
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:54,768
We'll be here for a short time...
You don't love me, Evaristo!

499
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:57,360
What on earth are you talking about?

500
00:33:57,456 --> 00:33:59,280
You don't even love our children!

501
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,816
Marta!
- If you loved us,

502
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:04,944
you'd do something to find
an apartment. Seek not, find not.

503
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,376
And this?
Do you think I've been fishing?

504
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:11,064
All I know is that
because of you we're homeless.

505
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:13,568
That too? I bet you
think I did it on purpose!

506
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:16,948
It wouldn't be the first case.
- Tell me what's wrong with you!

507
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,136
Hit me, at least
have the courage to say

508
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:22,624
that you plan to leave us.
- I'm going to look for an apartment,

509
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:25,320
and I'm not coming back
until I wear out my shoes,

510
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,120
to see if you're convinced.

511
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:29,808
He's so interested,
perhaps he'll go barefoot.

512
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:32,784
I don't want to see that
witch Daniela around here!

513
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,832
Marta, why do we
have to argue right now?

514
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:42,000
If we had to separate
because of the damn apartment,

515
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:45,072
I swear I'd hit the booze.
- Get out of my sight!

516
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,158
APARTMENTS FOR SALE
SOLD

517
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,294
APARTMENTS FOR SALE

518
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:10,896
- As hard as he may look...
- There's a nice breeze tonight.

519
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:13,104
Yeah, to each his own, right?

520
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:15,024
It's not my fault.

521
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,848
- Watchman!
- Coming!

522
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,960
Drunk, and stingy to boot.

523
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:21,648
Why don't you build
houses for rich people!

524
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,280
- Watchman!
- Coming!

525
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,144
Honey!

526
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,400
So much caution!
I'll be wearing loafers by Sunday.

527
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:45,068
Did you find an apartment or didn't you?
- The candle will burn out.

528
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:47,864
Then you'll sleep out there.
- You're overreacting!

529
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:50,352
Come on, let me in, I'll explain.

530
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,560
No, no, I don't want to hear more lies.

531
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,192
I've spent the whole day...!

532
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:11,088
- Now!
- Mom, we want water!

533
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,872
Mom, we want water!

534
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:17,904
Come on, come on...
Mom, we want water!

535
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Mom, we want water!

536
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:30,096
Mom, we want water!
Mom, we want water!

537
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:39,696
Mom, we want water!
- Be quiet!

538
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,012
Do you think it's time to play games?

539
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:51,792
Come on, now be good and
go to sleep, mommy is exhausted.

540
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,608
And you too.

541
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:28,656
Wow! Is there anything left to cut?
It'll be some penicillin for you.

542
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:30,576
Oh...

543
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,856
Penicillin...

544
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:48,624
Hi, since it's so drafty I thought:
"Stuff to build a fire".

545
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,544
Oh, no!

546
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,336
Good morning, Mr. Fulgencio,

547
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:38,736
I come to thank you for yesterday.

548
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:41,904
Come on! Jog along and
look for an apartment out there,

549
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
we've done just
what we had to do here.

550
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:46,846
I'm grateful.
If I can be of any service...

551
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,916
No injections for me, liquor is fine.

552
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:51,600
And don't go napping now.
This is going fast.

553
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,536
I can see.

554
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:06,864
Good morning, don Evaristo!

555
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:08,692
Good morning. How about a shine?

556
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:11,292
No thanks, I'm not
in the mood for frills today.

557
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:12,816
The usual?
Yes, some brandy.

558
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:15,780
With a touch of strychnine,
maybe I'll kick the bucket.

559
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:18,892
It's useless to look for
an apartment without real money.

560
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:21,848
When I came to Madrid
there was a lot to choose from...

561
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:25,196
Yes, the usual story.
- If you could hold out until Sunday...

562
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,468
By then I'll be sleeping
under a bridge, if there's no fee.

563
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:30,816
I mean I'll be
bullfighting for three bills.

564
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:35,232
You're a pal, but that
won't even get a pigeon coop.

565
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:40,364
They're offering 5000 to the fool who'll
perform as the sitting duck "Tancredo".

566
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,592
and nobody has shown up yet.
- Well, I'd jump at the chance.

567
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:46,800
Five thousand bucks!
Yeah, but to do that

568
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:49,680
you have to be an idiot,
or you have to be desperate.

569
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:52,464
Yes, both.
Well, any ads?

570
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,384
A few. Here they are.

571
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:56,304
The top one is urgent.

572
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,048
Don Fernando!
Don Fernando!

573
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:03,120
There must be an apartment!
He's left his liquor!

574
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,232
Let Don Tancredo have it.

575
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,752
CREDIT LOANS MORTGAGES

576
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,772
If you don't learn,
I'll send you to the village to plow.

577
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:13,296
Dad, it's just that
I'm bad with numbers...

578
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:16,080
It's not a question
of numbers, but of finances!

579
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:19,536
Look, for example, in this
book interests are written down

580
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:21,744
at half a percent.
- For us?

581
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,800
- For the public, you mongrel!
- Good morning, here I am.

582
00:42:24,896 --> 00:42:27,416
I was waiting for you,
my friend, go right in...

583
00:42:27,508 --> 00:42:30,980
I know, dad, and in this other
one the same money is written down

584
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:34,224
at five and a half.
- For us or for the public?

585
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,760
For us.

586
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:37,488
Have you all heard?

587
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:39,696
Is he good or not?

588
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:44,016
All right, boy.
You'll make a great banker.

589
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:55,920
What's the matter? Are you nervous?
Don't worry,

590
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:57,920
I'm sorry about the German syringe.

591
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:00,720
They're expensive,
luckily I brought another one.

592
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,312
On the arm?
- Wherever you like, don Fernando.

593
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:05,544
I'm looking for
an apartment like crazy.

594
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:08,284
They started tearing
down my house yesterday!

595
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,992
Oh, my goodness.
- You can say that again.

596
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,302
By the way, today
I saw a new neighborhood

597
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:16,364
where they sell those
new apartments they're building now.

598
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,404
Of course, they're small and expensive,
and the quality of the materials...

599
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:23,088
But you give them money
and they give you a home,

600
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:27,264
which is better than paying all your
life for a house that'll never be yours.

601
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,296
Right.

602
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,200
For me it would be a top solution.

603
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:32,592
Of course,
that would require some money.

604
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:34,224
Not much, 40,000 pesetas.

605
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:37,488
Hey, Don Fernando!
- Speak up, Gonzalez,

606
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:39,888
but hurry up, I'm running a little late.

607
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,384
It just occurred
to me, couldn't you...?

608
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,304
It's just a 40,000 credit.

609
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,704
You know my
professional creditworthiness.

610
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,872
Right, do you own properties?

611
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,944
No, sir, I don't...
- Neither rural nor urban?

612
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,728
Government securities?
Debt bonds? Stocks?

613
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:59,184
No, sir, I'm not...
- Do you have morally or commercially

614
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,776
solvent person who can vouch for you

615
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,368
with a guarantee
of about 400,000 pesetas?

616
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,152
But I only want 40,000 pesetas.

617
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,856
Don't you understand
it doesn't work that way, Gonzalez?

618
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,976
I don't understand.
- It's very easy,

619
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:16,848
if you have no money,
how can I give you a loan?

620
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:19,536
If I had it,
I wouldn't be asking for it.

621
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:21,936
Odd way of thinking, my friend Gonzalez!

622
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:24,816
To answer for the return of that amount,

623
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,484
plus interest, you need collateral

624
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:30,768
with assets that...
- Please, roll up that sleeve.

625
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:36,336
If you were to find
the two co-signers I mentioned,

626
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:38,352
come back here and I'll...
Ouch...!

627
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:40,464
Ouch...

628
00:44:56,688 --> 00:45:00,336
Hey, you! Are you a maid now?

629
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,736
I need strong arms here!
- It's for...

630
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:05,616
She asked me and, naturally...

631
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,016
You're dumb as an ox!
Is your eyesight bad?

632
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:09,552
Watch out, I'm coming!

633
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:12,624
A maid now. If this goes on...

634
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:16,464
Do you think it's wrong
to be gallant to the ladies?

635
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:31,632
Nice stew!
- If you'd like to join us later...

636
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:33,936
My husband loves stews.
- And who doesn't?

637
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:37,104
You have plenty of mouths to feed..

638
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:40,080
If you need more...
- It's enough. Don't bother him!

639
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:42,096
Let them. I really like them.

640
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:44,016
If you don't need anything else...

641
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:46,524
Else? I don't know how
we're going to pay you.

642
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,336
Mommy! Here comes daddy.

643
00:45:48,432 --> 00:45:50,256
I hope he found something.

644
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:53,424
- Daddy, daddy!
- Hi, daddy!

645
00:45:58,512 --> 00:46:01,296
Finding an apartment
has become impossible.

646
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,368
Although when you least expect it...
- Marta!

647
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:08,112
Look, look!

648
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:15,696
I'm going to have a look.
- Oh, my God, I need some luck!

649
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:18,768
Would you mind watching
the children for a moment?

650
00:46:18,864 --> 00:46:20,976
Above all, keep them
away from the stove.

651
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:23,184
I'm on it.
Don't let it get away.

652
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:30,000
I made it!
We finally have somewhere to go.

653
00:46:30,096 --> 00:46:32,084
They say it's a pigsty.
As if we care.

654
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,056
Do you have the address? It's over
there, on the other side of the river.

655
00:46:36,152 --> 00:46:38,716
No palace, but we'll
have a roof over our heads.

656
00:46:38,736 --> 00:46:42,576
The bus stop will be nearby.
See how I got something?

657
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:25,980
Which is the house that is vacant?
- This one, pretty as the moonlight.

658
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,944
Good ventilation,
city views and reliable neighbors.

659
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:31,632
Can we...?
Yes. As much as you like.

660
00:47:46,704 --> 00:47:48,912
So? All good?

661
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:51,216
It takes a special stomach...

662
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:54,864
Well, with a little
cleaning... How much?

663
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,936
Cheap. A grand.
- A grand? What kind?

664
00:47:58,028 --> 00:48:00,828
A thousand pesetas, as you
city-slickers say. A steal.

665
00:48:00,924 --> 00:48:02,644
Are you crazy?
Come on, Evaristo.

666
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,656
Marta, keep our situation in mind.

667
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:07,056
Listen, It seems too much

668
00:48:07,076 --> 00:48:09,176
for a rental transfer.
- Transfer? What!

669
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:13,872
I told you I'm just
selling the furniture, sir.

670
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,144
This is going fine.
- As long as there are no hindrances...

671
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,968
When did that family leave?

672
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:41,520
The third floor is done,
except for one in the back.

673
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:44,304
Now we'll do the other one.
- Fulgencio!

674
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,184
Hi there!

675
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:51,120
You have to mind the company you keep...
- Are they still there?

676
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:54,104
They still have nowhere to go.
We moved them downstairs

677
00:48:54,196 --> 00:48:57,972
so that they could have two more days.
They don't really get in the way.

678
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,160
The demolition continues.
- Have you lost your mind? Come.

679
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:02,256
Hell to pay now.

680
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,556
You're obstructing
and running a serious risk.

681
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:18,576
Don't you realize it?
- We're sorry.

682
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:22,032
We can't even find
a hole to place our bones.

683
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:24,576
We can't sublet,
especially with four children.

684
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:27,684
And if something were to
happen to you? Who'd be to blame?

685
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,260
- The company doesn't want any trouble.
- We thought you called us.

686
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:32,784
If you need a hand...

687
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,184
We are with you all
the way, Mr. Fulgencio.

688
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,008
You can see, inspector.

689
00:49:37,096 --> 00:49:40,176
I wash my hands. You people
should know what you're doing.

690
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:43,728
Why don't you go to the
Charity Association for an apartment?

691
00:49:45,456 --> 00:49:48,240
Nail this properly.

692
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:50,444
Is it true what he said?

693
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,520
You'd better give it a try.
There's nothing here for you.

694
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,120
If we find an apartment,
I'll make him a statue.

695
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:58,324
Come on, let's go. Run!
- Thank you all.

696
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,894
Oh, the kids.
I'll have to call someone.

697
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,488
You people go ahead.
I'll keep an eye on them.

698
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,288
Thank you.
- C'mon! Don't you have anything to do?

699
00:50:06,384 --> 00:50:09,936
What the hell are you doing here?
Come on, let's go! Get to work!

700
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:24,306
HOME OWNERSHIP IS
THE FOUNDATION OF A FAMILY

701
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:27,834
HOUSING SPECULATION
IS A CRIMINAL ACT

702
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:33,398
THE HOUSING PROBLEM IS
THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE OF OUR TIME

703
00:50:34,512 --> 00:50:36,720
This way. Follow me.

704
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:45,264
Miss, please.
See what these fine people need.

705
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,312
Do you have a letter
from a lady of the board?

706
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:52,624
Well...

707
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,632
No recommendation,
not even from a donating partner?

708
00:50:55,824 --> 00:50:59,472
No, miss. The only thing we
bring is one of those Greek dramas.

709
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:02,168
So, go all the way to
the back, then to the right.

710
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:03,696
Sector four.
- Thank you.

711
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,871
SECTOR FOUR HOUSING
FOR LARGE FAMILIES

712
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,712
Hi.
- You want a place or your own, right?

713
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:20,688
Even if it were a dump.
- We couldn't consent to that.

714
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:22,992
We're here to please you. Let's see.

715
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:25,872
How many in the family?
- We have four bellies.

716
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,740
I'm sure they're beautiful.
All boys or any girls?

717
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,916
There are two girls in the
middle, Milagritos and Martita.

718
00:51:32,012 --> 00:51:34,016
Lovely.
- If you could see the boys...

719
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:37,108
They're Enriquito and Pepín.
The older one's just like me.

720
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:39,024
I bet they're beautiful. Well...

721
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:41,520
Let's start with this little white form.

722
00:51:41,616 --> 00:51:44,116
It's the A-72 for a
sworn declaration of assets.

723
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,128
You'll want five rooms, right?

724
00:51:46,224 --> 00:51:48,124
Then fill out this card.

725
00:51:48,144 --> 00:51:50,544
This is H-16 and
it needs two photographs,

726
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:53,524
one from the front and
one in profile. Don't tell me...

727
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,152
I bet you prefer with a view?

728
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:58,608
So, the yellow 115.
Two business endorsements

729
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,470
vouching for the moral
integrity of the gentleman.

730
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,256
Would you like
to paint it cream-colored?

731
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:07,060
The boys' rooms in blue
and the girls' rooms in pink?

732
00:52:07,152 --> 00:52:10,320
Take the B-56 for
the family health report.

733
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,528
Isn't it a beautiful model?

734
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:16,176
And this is the M-42 for
the report on the previous address.

735
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:18,672
Naturally, you'll
want it with a bathroom.

736
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,840
Then have the M-3
for the sales sworn statement.

737
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:24,624
Oh, and the M-4 also
with a little corner torn off.

738
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:26,256
We'll give you a low floor.

739
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:30,384
And this one and this one...

740
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,264
And this one. And this one.

741
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:36,624
All of them well filled in
and with very clear handwriting.

742
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:40,080
Still more?
- There are still a few left.

743
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:42,000
This sky-blue one.

744
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:44,304
And this sea green with its annex.

745
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,472
And these little lists
which are the best of all..

746
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,392
I forgot! And this one to

747
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:51,696
tell us what you want.

748
00:52:51,984 --> 00:52:54,864
Well, and with all this,
we'll get an apartment, right?

749
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,840
But, sir, with all this,
we'll open a file for you.

750
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:00,624
Well, what about the apartment?
- What apartment?

751
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:04,464
You fill all that out
and then you'll be in our files,

752
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,096
along with all of these here.

753
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:08,688
The apartments
are delivered in strict order.

754
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:12,432
Let's go, Evaristo.

755
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:14,336
Wait, please. just a moment.

756
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:18,392
You're forgetting the most important
thing. Our useful explanatory brochure

757
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:21,456
on how to fill in the forms.
It's only three pesetas.

758
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:23,376
Thank you. We'll play it by ear.

759
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:25,296
Oh!

760
00:53:30,313 --> 00:53:34,764
ONLY WITH HIS OWN HOME CAN
A MAN FULFILL HIS SOCIAL DESTINY.

761
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:50,448
That guy solved his housing problems.

762
00:53:50,544 --> 00:53:52,176
Don't be irreverent.

763
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:55,728
What a boring funeral.
- He mustn't have any relatives.

764
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,992
Sometimes that happens.
- Or he didn't leave any money.

765
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,296
Which also happens sometimes.
- Yes.

766
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,848
Evaristo!

767
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:08,496
Tell me you're not
considering living in a graveyard!

768
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:11,088
The apartment. Don't you understand?
- Let's go!

769
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:14,064
Very convenient death.

770
00:54:32,304 --> 00:54:36,528
56 La Palma street, third floor,
apartment 22, downtown.

771
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:41,808
Perhaps he's been
repeating it quite a lot.

772
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:45,920
While I reserve the apartment,
you go see the landlady.

773
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:48,816
Why don't you go see her
and I book the apartment?

774
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:51,024
There's a lady involved.
I think it's...

775
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:54,000
All right. Wait for me

776
00:54:54,096 --> 00:54:56,592
and don't let them beat you to it.
- Boy!

777
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,856
- Doorwoman!
- Doorwoman!

778
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:18,000
- Doorwoman!
- Doorwoman!

779
00:55:18,384 --> 00:55:21,360
- Doorwoman!
- What's all the fuss about?

780
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:23,080
I can't be everywhere at once.

781
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:26,448
I come to see the empty apartment.
Where did the deceased live?

782
00:55:26,544 --> 00:55:29,424
- I was the first to arrive.
- For God's sake!

783
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,344
Wait for me to find the key.

784
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,928
I was the first to see the funeral!

785
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:36,816
- And the others?
- Either all together, or no one.

786
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:39,216
Where have you been?
- I'm hoarse.

787
00:55:39,312 --> 00:55:42,480
My wife went to rent it.
- It's in the bag.

788
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:44,496
My wife too.
- It can't be long now.

789
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:47,552
Guys, after all, there's no hurry.

790
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:51,408
At this time of day,
Mrs. Obdulia is busy.

791
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:54,864
Is the owner of the apartment here?
- Come in.

792
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,416
Come in.

793
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:08,016
Come in and sit down.
It's time for her evening prayers.

794
00:56:11,664 --> 00:56:14,352
Another one who
wants the apartment, madam.

795
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:16,656
We already have eight in the pot.

796
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:26,916
Watch out for that step!
Come this way,

797
00:56:27,112 --> 00:56:29,232
and don't break your bones.
- Thank you.

798
00:56:29,328 --> 00:56:32,304
Rheumatism and the
stairs are killing me.

799
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,316
In other times, when I was a girl...

800
00:56:34,412 --> 00:56:37,412
You're still a spring chicken.
- And weigh like a feather.

801
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:39,796
- You're very nice.
- Well, as I was saying.

802
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:41,424
It hasn't been 20 years yet...

803
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,880
In my village,
grandmothers are carried up in arms!

804
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,896
- No, no, no!
- Up with the girl!

805
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,496
No, no, no, leave me!
Leave me alone!

806
00:56:56,976 --> 00:56:59,664
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

807
00:57:07,536 --> 00:57:10,128
I'm late getting there,
but I'm getting there.

808
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:17,520
Rita! Rita!

809
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:19,824
Please! Please!

810
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,204
Don't pester her.

811
00:58:22,224 --> 00:58:25,142
Please, don't harass her.

812
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:28,080
For God's sake, let's be calm.

813
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,072
I can't please you all.
And God knows I'd like to.

814
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:35,664
Let's see.

815
00:58:35,856 --> 00:58:38,736
- What can you afford?
- What?

816
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:40,848
We don't live on a salary,

817
00:58:40,944 --> 00:58:43,344
we could pay 150 pesetas.
- I'll pay 200.

818
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,840
- I'll give you 250.
- I'll go up to 300.

819
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:50,160
- 310.
- 350. No one will take it from me.

820
00:58:50,256 --> 00:58:53,136
- Of course. a house of...
- Oh, yeah? Take that!

821
00:58:55,728 --> 00:59:00,624
My saints! My saints!
Oh, my God! Oh!

822
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:06,326
- Madam!
- Ouch!

823
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:09,360
- Madam!
- How awful!

824
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:13,296
My health is at risk!

825
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,008
POLICE STATION

826
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:54,672
My husband!

827
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:03,312
See how it wasn't that easy?

828
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:14,544
Evaristo.

829
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:18,288
What? What is it?
- Mr. Fulgencio wants to talk to you.

830
01:00:18,384 --> 01:00:19,824
He says it's urgent.

831
01:00:29,616 --> 01:00:32,496
Good morning,
Mr. Fulgencio. Marta told me...

832
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,688
Let's cut to the chase.
Noon is the limit.

833
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:37,872
Before three o'clock,
I start tearing down the apartment.

834
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,312
But, Mr. Fulgencio...

835
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:41,904
You've been warned.
I can't do any more.

836
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,112
Now do your part, like a man.

837
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:47,088
Now you know what's what. At three.

838
01:00:55,632 --> 01:00:58,224
Let's move! Let's go!
That's what I'm paying for!

839
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,856
You bums!

840
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:04,464
What are you staring at?
Let's get to work!

841
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:07,056
And you too, what are you looking at?

842
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:09,648
Come on, man!
Hit it with the pickaxe!

843
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,952
I'm not paying you this month.

844
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:20,880
Did you hear?

845
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:24,704
What a useless husband
you have! What can I do?

846
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,802
Other than throw myself off a bridge.

847
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:29,524
It's not your fault.
- I've driven you all to ruin!

848
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,608
What can I offer you?
To sleep at the foot of a lamppost?

849
01:01:32,692 --> 01:01:35,956
We still have the gypsy's hut.
The furniture is very expensive.

850
01:01:36,052 --> 01:01:39,516
I still have 300 pesetas left.
I'll be... He's asking for a grand.

851
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,712
Oh, my God.

852
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:45,936
Evaristo, what if we sold our stuff?

853
01:01:46,032 --> 01:01:49,104
Look. I still have mom's vintage fan.

854
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,080
I think we'd get 100 for it.

855
01:01:54,192 --> 01:01:56,496
And the knives your friends

856
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:58,416
gave you as a wedding gift.

857
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:14,256
Remember when we became sweethearts?

858
01:02:14,352 --> 01:02:16,464
They were playing
at the merry-go-round.

859
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,056
And you looked at me in a way...

860
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,896
Put it all away again, come on.
- That's silly.

861
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,488
The rings are made of gold.
Come on, hurry up.

862
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:27,504
Don't stand there like a fool.

863
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,488
They're made of gold.
I think this should do it, right?

864
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:48,316
600 pesetas for everything. No more.

865
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:52,656
It's junk. I'm losing money
with it. If it doesn't suit you...

866
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:56,784
Let's see if this covers it.

867
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:29,696
Thank God. It's empty.
It's not that small, right?

868
01:03:29,988 --> 01:03:32,880
It looks roomy to me.
- To me, it's the Royal Palace.

869
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,144
Look. The bed will go here.
The children on the other side.

870
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:39,504
Milagritos next to us.
There's room for a dresser here.

871
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,548
We'll put your things here.
I'll set up a stove for you,

872
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,772
so you can cook to your heart's content.

873
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,264
The table won't fit.
Nor the chest of drawers.

874
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,436
And where will we put the chairs?
We'll put everything in.

875
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:52,856
It's just a question
of squeezing in a little.

876
01:03:52,948 --> 01:03:55,260
That way I'll be closer to you.
- Silly boy.

877
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:57,276
There'll be clothes hanging here.

878
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:03,120
Can you forgive me for doubting you?

879
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:06,864
I thought you'd be
leaving us. It was nonsense.

880
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:17,032
What are you two doing here?

881
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:20,112
That's what movie theaters are for.
- The house is taken.

882
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:22,032
We were here first.

883
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:24,824
What about this?
It's the bill for the furniture.

884
01:04:25,392 --> 01:04:28,656
So make yourself scarce.
- Marta!

885
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:32,112
Marta!

886
01:04:32,304 --> 01:04:35,280
Marta! Marta, please!
It wasn't my fault.

887
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,968
And whose fault was it? Mine?
- It was fate.

888
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,696
Blame it on your shenanigans.

889
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,576
Madruga this, a friend
that, the agency this...

890
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,496
All lies!
- You're wrong.

891
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:46,416
I swear to you...
- Leave me alone!

892
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:33,168
Why did you lock the door?

893
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,836
Madam, out of habit.

894
01:05:35,856 --> 01:05:38,544
It's lunchtime,
I'm going to open right away.

895
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:40,368
You can go in through the hole.

896
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:43,824
Just what I needed.

897
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,544
This Einstein here.
- Me? Since no debris was falling...

898
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,616
Well, shut up or I'll bang
you over your head!

899
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,992
No need to get that way.

900
01:05:59,184 --> 01:06:03,024
I've done some sailing
and this means you feel stormy waters.

901
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:05,136
Stormy waters my...

902
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:28,464
So what are you staring at?
Yes! I told him to hit the road.

903
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,824
And they'll leave by 3 PM
or my name isn't Fulgencio.

904
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,280
I won't lose my job just so
Don Evaristo can laze about.

905
01:06:35,376 --> 01:06:37,584
Well, he's searching, but...
- But what?

906
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,256
He who seeks, sooner or later, finds.

907
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:42,192
Yes. That seems easy, but...

908
01:06:42,288 --> 01:06:44,688
It's just that the housing problem...

909
01:06:44,784 --> 01:06:47,856
So now it's my fault that
the situation is hopeless.

910
01:06:48,048 --> 01:06:50,544
There are four children, Mr. Fulgencio.
- Sure!

911
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:53,136
Am I to blame for that?
Am I their father?

912
01:06:53,328 --> 01:06:54,768
No, but...
- What? Speak up!

913
01:06:54,864 --> 01:06:56,304
It takes good will.

914
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,116
With good will it can be fixed.

915
01:06:58,308 --> 01:07:02,048
- If poor folk don't help each other...
- It can work out for everyone.

916
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:05,136
You honor your contract
and they get a day and a half.

917
01:07:46,224 --> 01:07:47,280
Trains.

918
01:07:47,376 --> 01:07:49,776
Do you enjoy trains?

919
01:07:49,872 --> 01:07:54,288
Come on, mate,
I'm hitting the red wine.

920
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:57,168
And what are you up to?
- I'm desperate.

921
01:07:57,264 --> 01:07:58,704
Do you see that huge city?

922
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,368
Which one?
- It's a mirage.

923
01:08:04,464 --> 01:08:06,488
There's not a single apartment in it.

924
01:08:06,684 --> 01:08:08,004
You can't mix things up.

925
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,416
There is only finance and horse-trading.

926
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:13,488
Don't talk nonsense, there are
plenty of apartments.

927
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:15,600
Do you know of any?
- Of course I do.

928
01:08:15,696 --> 01:08:17,520
I know about 20 or 30.

929
01:08:17,616 --> 01:08:20,304
I'd settle for one.
Do you want to tell me where?

930
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,664
Shih, you have to blow something first.

931
01:08:24,336 --> 01:08:27,312
Without "blowing", "march" doesn't beep.

932
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,576
Without "march" no one moves.

933
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:34,704
And if we don't get out
of here a train will run over us.

934
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:36,720
Huh? What do you think, ma'am?

935
01:08:36,816 --> 01:08:40,560
I think it's a good remedy.
That way we have until Sunday.

936
01:08:40,656 --> 01:08:43,824
But first thing Monday morning
we start tearing it all down.

937
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,936
You are a guardian angel.

938
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:47,856
Me? No way, it's the boys.

939
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,200
Say yes, ma'am,

940
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,120
when he gets to thinking...

941
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:55,056
Thank you. Thank you all.

942
01:08:55,728 --> 01:08:58,800
Good-bye.
Bye-bye!

943
01:08:58,896 --> 01:09:01,488
Bye-bye, guys, bye-bye.

944
01:09:03,024 --> 01:09:04,272
Hey!
- What?

945
01:09:04,368 --> 01:09:06,012
You're stepping on them.
- What?

946
01:09:06,096 --> 01:09:09,072
The wings, Mr. Fulgencio, the wings.

947
01:09:14,256 --> 01:09:16,272
Get the hell outta here!

948
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:18,480
No pushing, man, no pushing!

949
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:20,976
Hey, more respect, I'm a graduate!

950
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,280
And I have a degree, do you understand?

951
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:26,736
Let's sing, mate, and forget the rest.

952
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:30,384
I have apartments for free.

953
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,936
I have apartments for two 10-cent coins.

954
01:09:34,032 --> 01:09:37,296
I pull apartments out of my sleeve.

955
01:09:37,392 --> 01:09:40,560
I got apartments for free.
- Hey, it's this way, huh?

956
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:42,672
Oh, yeah, right.
This is my street.

957
01:09:42,768 --> 01:09:43,920
Let's go.

958
01:09:44,016 --> 01:09:47,088
I got apartments for free.

959
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:50,928
I pull apartments out of my sleeve.

960
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:54,096
I got apartments for two 10-cent coins.

961
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,032
I got apartments for free.

962
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:01,584
I have apartments for free.

963
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,232
I pull apartments from my sleeve.

964
01:10:05,328 --> 01:10:08,784
I got apartments for two 10-cent coins.

965
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,856
Come, let's sing as a trio.

966
01:10:11,952 --> 01:10:14,236
Where did you get
so drunk, don Evaristo?

967
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,528
Do you want a beautiful apartment?
You can have it, Cambreires.

968
01:10:17,624 --> 01:10:20,112
Keep it for yourself, you need it.

969
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,456
Come on, man, come on.

970
01:10:21,552 --> 01:10:24,144
You live in these ruins?
- Yes, I do.

971
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,736
I mean, until this morning.

972
01:10:26,832 --> 01:10:29,712
And I also had a family and a...

973
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,208
Now I'm just thirsty.

974
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:34,608
Are you also a tenant?

975
01:10:34,704 --> 01:10:38,544
No, sir. Landlord, by the grace of God.

976
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,984
Come on, let's go.

977
01:10:40,656 --> 01:10:42,000
You're a...?

978
01:10:42,096 --> 01:10:44,880
We're not friends anymore!
- No damn need to be!

979
01:10:44,976 --> 01:10:46,992
We're not friends anymore, you leech!

980
01:10:47,088 --> 01:10:49,008
Come here and I'll break your bones!

981
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,448
Tenant!
- Come here!

982
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:53,520
Let me at him!

983
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,536
Leech!

984
01:10:57,936 --> 01:10:59,376
Yeah, yeah.

985
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:04,080
I've got apartments for free...

986
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:06,096
Come on, don Evaristo, do as I say.

987
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:08,016
Be reasonable and let's go home.

988
01:11:10,704 --> 01:11:11,952
Marta!

989
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,736
Martita, my dear woman!
- Don't touch me!

990
01:11:15,012 --> 01:11:16,168
Aren't you ashamed?

991
01:11:16,264 --> 01:11:18,672
Sweetie, don't you
love your hubby anymore?

992
01:11:18,768 --> 01:11:20,112
Drunkard!

993
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:21,936
Marta.

994
01:11:23,856 --> 01:11:25,104
Marta!

995
01:11:26,928 --> 01:11:30,576
Go on, open for your little
Evaristo, he's in a good mood.

996
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:33,264
Come on, my sweet muffin.

997
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,528
Come on, don't play
hide and seek and open up.

998
01:11:36,624 --> 01:11:37,776
Do it.

999
01:11:39,024 --> 01:11:40,464
She won't open.

1000
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,552
She won't open.

1001
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,852
WELCOME TO HAPINESS NEIGHBORHOOD

1002
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,000
FOR RENT.

1003
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,700
THE TENANT WILL GET A BONUS

1004
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,000

Madam.

Sir.

1010
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:24,816
Little kids.

1011
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:29,136
Since I don't know how
to make speeches, I won't speak.

1012
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:33,840
I'LL just say, "Welcome to
the Neighborhood of Happiness."

1013
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:39,888
Free at last!

1014
01:13:40,944 --> 01:13:45,168
Apartments, apartments Madruga!
The best, guaranteed!

1015
01:13:45,264 --> 01:13:47,856
I have a degree in televisions.

1016
01:13:47,952 --> 01:13:50,160
Apartments for boys and girls

1017
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:53,136
and I provide housekeeping!

1018
01:13:53,232 --> 01:13:55,728
Out!
- Get out!

1019
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:06,000
- Ouch!
- Ah!

1020
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,664
And now follow me to
your new, comfortable home.

1021
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:35,349
D. EVARISTO GONZÁLEZ
MEDICAL AND SURGICAL PARAMEDIC

1022
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:08,880
Your cigar, sir.

1023
01:15:11,856 --> 01:15:13,200
Your whisky, sir.

1024
01:15:15,984 --> 01:15:18,672
Only this small requirement remains,

1025
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:20,316
and the apartment is yours.

1026
01:15:20,608 --> 01:15:23,104
Evaristo, 17 built-in closets!

1027
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:26,928
Dad, look, there's a room full of toys!

1028
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:29,136
The number of faucets in the bathroom!

1029
01:15:29,232 --> 01:15:32,316
And the kitchen full of white
tiles. And there's a fridge!

1030
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:34,704
All this plus the signing bonus in cash

1031
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:38,256
will be yours to enjoy
if you're kind enough to sign.

1032
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:39,888
Hey, the house is shaking.

1033
01:15:39,984 --> 01:15:42,384
Ah, a small tremor of no importance.

1034
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,456
Don't worry,
construction is top quality.

1035
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:46,896
Besides, it's insured.

1036
01:15:46,992 --> 01:15:49,296
Evaristo, there's
even a washing machine!

1037
01:15:51,888 --> 01:15:54,864
I understand that you
give injections with a slingshot.

1038
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,204
That's an exaggeration!

1039
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,188
Would you be so kind as
to make a demonstration for me?

1040
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:01,680
Me? It's just that
there's no target in sight.

1041
01:16:01,776 --> 01:16:03,120
Just a moment.

1042
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,952
Slave.

1043
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:28,944
Ah!

1044
01:16:50,832 --> 01:16:52,176
Marta!

1045
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:05,616
Marta!

1046
01:17:05,904 --> 01:17:08,496
Oh, dear, they're not here!

1047
01:17:08,592 --> 01:17:13,008
Pepín! Milagritos!
Enriquito! Martita!

1048
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,504
Marta!

1049
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,136
Oh, dear, they're gone!

1050
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,104
Stay with the children,
I'll see him off.

1051
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,256
The big rascal...

1052
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:41,136
Open the door! Marta!

1053
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:43,152
Open the door now!

1054
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:44,880
Can you hear me, Marta?

1055
01:17:45,152 --> 01:17:48,720
Get out of here and stop making a fuss.
- I want to talk to my wife.

1056
01:17:48,816 --> 01:17:51,216
She won't talk to drunkards
Leave us alone.

1057
01:17:51,312 --> 01:17:53,320
Marta, Marta!
I want to explain, Marta.

1058
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,248
It's not what you think.
- Really!

1059
01:17:55,344 --> 01:17:58,224
Your family out on the
street and you go on a bender!

1060
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,664
Go back to your pals.

1061
01:17:59,856 --> 01:18:00,816
Mart...!

1062
01:18:00,912 --> 01:18:04,176
Marta, please open up!

1063
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:10,572
Marta, listen to me
it's not what you think.

1064
01:18:11,264 --> 01:18:13,392
Are you going to
deny what my eyes saw?

1065
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,120
That's what I want to explain.

1066
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:18,112
Leave that and tell me
what you've done with the money.

1067
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:19,728
You know where it came from.

1068
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:22,508
Well, I was desperate,
I don't know how I could...

1069
01:18:22,604 --> 01:18:25,488
But you know me well and
you know how much I love you.

1070
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:28,772
And what are you trying to do,
set us up on a plot of land?

1071
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,456
Apartments cost money
and I don't have any, Marta!

1072
01:18:33,552 --> 01:18:34,704
I don't have it!

1073
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:37,200
You tell him what he is...

1074
01:18:38,336 --> 01:18:41,232
You're not expecting me
to go out and earn it myself?

1075
01:18:41,328 --> 01:18:42,480
That's it.

1076
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:46,416
Since you love us
so much, show your worth.

1077
01:18:46,436 --> 01:18:48,344
There, let's see what he says now.

1078
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,544
Real men know how to earn money.

1079
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,464
Show us what you're made of.

1080
01:18:58,896 --> 01:19:00,624
I will.

1081
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,792
Pour me a brandy
and put it on my account.

1082
01:19:17,888 --> 01:19:20,668
I'm sorry, don Evaristo,
but it's already topped up.

1083
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:23,280
Please understand.
Make it a double, it's on me.

1084
01:19:23,376 --> 01:19:25,104
Are you coming to the bullfight?

1085
01:19:25,196 --> 01:19:27,016
A bullfight is just what I need.

1086
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:29,808
I don't know where or how,
but I have to earn money.

1087
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:31,516
My proposal still stands.

1088
01:19:31,536 --> 01:19:34,296
Five big ones.
Yeah, right. Really good.

1089
01:19:34,388 --> 01:19:36,900
You just stand still
and later collect your pay.

1090
01:19:36,996 --> 01:19:38,536
And who holds on to the bull?

1091
01:19:38,632 --> 01:19:41,056
If you want something
you have to work for it.

1092
01:19:41,136 --> 01:19:44,208
I'm not up to it.
And it's not because of the bull.

1093
01:19:44,304 --> 01:19:47,664
What are you waiting for?
You'll probably get a lamb of a bull.

1094
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,064
You have to do something big to recoup

1095
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,600
prestige, don Evaristo.

1096
01:19:52,656 --> 01:19:55,728
Come on, don Eva.
Yes, you might be right.

1097
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,648
I appreciate it, Jiménez.

1098
01:19:57,744 --> 01:20:00,144
But I still have another option.

1099
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:02,640
To your health!

1100
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:06,384
Oh, and for the record,
it's not out of fear, eh?

1101
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,516
And he says it's not out of fear!

1102
01:20:09,632 --> 01:20:10,856
Gonzalez!
Hello, Lola.

1103
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:13,164
But hadn't we finished the treatment?

1104
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,236
Yes, but I've decided to
accept your investment proposal.

1105
01:20:16,256 --> 01:20:19,056
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1106
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,880
But it was you who insisted.

1107
01:20:20,976 --> 01:20:23,280
Remember: "With me
your money will be safer

1108
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:25,596
than in the bank."
Yes, yes, yes, but...

1109
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:32,456
- Who's this guy?
- Gonzalez, the nurse practitioner.

1110
01:20:32,472 --> 01:20:34,876
This is Mr. Gonzalez
and this is my boyfriend.

1111
01:20:34,972 --> 01:20:37,008
Right, your b... Pleased to meet you.

1112
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:39,216
And don't your forget it, Mr. González,

1113
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:42,096
I'm the only one who
gets Lola's investments...

1114
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:44,496
Exclusively, get it?
Yes, sir...

1115
01:20:46,032 --> 01:20:47,568
I'm kind of in a hurry.

1116
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:50,064
Sorry I can't help you. Good day.

1117
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,848
So, going into business on your own?

1118
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:54,288
It's not what you think!

1119
01:21:17,232 --> 01:21:19,536
Come on, hurry up, get your gear down.

1120
01:21:20,016 --> 01:21:22,032
Well, what should I do now?

1121
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,128
You don't have to do anything at all.

1122
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,304
The bull does everything.
- You just have to stand still...

1123
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:30,192
The bull comes, smells
you, paws, snorts, and feints.

1124
01:21:30,288 --> 01:21:32,796
And nothing else.
- You think that's not enough?

1125
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:34,900
By standing still, the bull retreats.

1126
01:21:34,996 --> 01:21:36,432
And if I move?

1127
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:38,544
If you move, two things can happen,

1128
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,940
you get gored by
the bull or by the public,

1129
01:21:41,036 --> 01:21:43,344
which is also bad.
But one thing's for sure,

1130
01:21:43,436 --> 01:21:46,416
if you move and spoil
the show, you won't get paid.

1131
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:49,904
Well, I won't pay you.
- You should have warned me beforehand.

1132
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,956
Courage and on to the bull, go on.

1133
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,456
Coward!

1134
01:22:15,976 --> 01:22:17,904
They just don't understand my art.

1135
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,908
Do you know something, don Evaristo?

1136
01:22:20,104 --> 01:22:23,184
I'm going back to shining
shoes. Let someone else do this.

1137
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:33,380
Don Tancredo! Don Tancredo!

1138
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:42,172
Come on, go on, now it's your turn.

1139
01:22:42,356 --> 01:22:45,744
Just a moment, just a minute.
- The public is getting impatient.

1140
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,952
I have to pray.
- Pray on the stand.

1141
01:22:48,044 --> 01:22:50,836
Come on, it's all right.
- I have to write to my wife.

1142
01:22:50,928 --> 01:22:52,752
Do you have a pen?
- Come out now.

1143
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:54,384
Then let me go to the toilet,

1144
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,112
I'm sick.
- Climb the pedestal!

1145
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:00,528
Come out at once! Let's go now!

1146
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:13,584
Don Tancredo, who got lost in Cuba!

1147
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,696
Come on, to the pedestal, let's go!

1148
01:23:18,096 --> 01:23:19,344
To the pedestal!

1149
01:23:20,688 --> 01:23:23,472
Don Tancredo!
Don Tancredo!

1150
01:23:23,568 --> 01:23:25,776
Don Tancredo, Don Tancredo!

1151
01:23:30,192 --> 01:23:33,264
For you, Marta, and for the children.

1152
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,704
Now he's smelling me.

1153
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:05,328
Now he's looking at me.

1154
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,920
Now he's pawing.

1155
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:13,392
Now snorting.

1156
01:24:14,256 --> 01:24:15,792
Now he's threatening me.

1157
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:20,784
Aaaaah!

1158
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,968
What an idiot!

1159
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:36,144
- Let's go, it's getting ugly.
- What about don Evaristo?

1160
01:24:36,164 --> 01:24:37,584
It's his fault...

1161
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:41,184
Let him get his act together as
best as he can! - Mr. Jimenez!

1162
01:24:54,864 --> 01:24:56,208
Damn it.

1163
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:09,552
No.

1164
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,336
Well...

1165
01:25:20,016 --> 01:25:22,416
The story is over,
everybody back to work.

1166
01:25:22,512 --> 01:25:25,200
But really, come on.
But they can't be far.

1167
01:25:25,296 --> 01:25:26,832
The furniture is inside.

1168
01:25:27,024 --> 01:25:29,616
And there's 27 cats dancing on my belly!

1169
01:25:29,712 --> 01:25:31,824
Come on, down with the derrick.

1170
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,896
Come on, can't you
hear what I'm telling you?

1171
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:41,040
Someone hit by a car, for sure!

1172
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:07,536
Very nice, let's just have a big
party and to hell with everything.

1173
01:26:07,628 --> 01:26:08,856
Great foreman you are.

1174
01:26:08,952 --> 01:26:12,252
And what would you do?
They just brought him from the hospital.

1175
01:26:12,348 --> 01:26:14,928
And I'm going to sue
you for breach of contract.

1176
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:17,352
Yes, gentlemen,
that's how I started my run.

1177
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:19,252
I did the statue with seven turns.

1178
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:21,176
Then I beckoned him from afar:

1179
01:26:21,272 --> 01:26:23,956
"Hey, hey, bull, ah!"
Have you people seen a train?

1180
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:27,332
That's how the big guy was coming.
- And you were a switchman.

1181
01:26:27,428 --> 01:26:30,316
I held on longer than anyone.
I was almost knocked out.

1182
01:26:30,408 --> 01:26:32,316
But the great one was Don Evaristo.

1183
01:26:32,408 --> 01:26:34,908
What a great guy,
he is the bravest of them all!

1184
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:36,728
We kind of made the crowd roar.

1185
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,224
Give it up, Don Evaristo.
You were a monster.

1186
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,328
Mr. Fulgencio is in trouble.

1187
01:26:41,424 --> 01:26:43,248
It's because of the furniture.

1188
01:26:43,344 --> 01:26:44,592
Let's go.

1189
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:50,528
For the last time, will you obey me?

1190
01:26:50,544 --> 01:26:52,272
Out with the furniture!

1191
01:27:04,272 --> 01:27:07,632
Don't worry about me,
I'll get the furniture out myself.

1192
01:27:07,824 --> 01:27:10,612
But, don Evaristo,
where the heck are we going to...?

1193
01:27:10,704 --> 01:27:11,952
That's his problem.

1194
01:27:13,284 --> 01:27:16,080
Aren't you afraid of
spending the night outdoors?

1195
01:27:16,176 --> 01:27:17,904
Don't make me laugh.

1196
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,744
Would you give me a hand?

1197
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,884
Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody.

1198
01:27:36,624 --> 01:27:39,504
Mrs. Marta!

1199
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:05,328
Where shall I put this?
- There.

1200
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:41,028
Well, come on, let's get
to work, let's get to work.

1201
01:28:41,224 --> 01:28:43,248
What are we doing here now? Let's go.

1202
01:28:43,344 --> 01:28:45,936
Come on, let's go.

1203
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,404
Come right in, gentlemen,
come on in, it's free.

1204
01:28:53,424 --> 01:28:56,976
Have fun contemplating
the homeless citizen.

1205
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,392
See? I already solved my problem.

1206
01:29:04,944 --> 01:29:06,096
Comfortable, huh?

1207
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:07,440
Comfortable.

1208
01:29:07,536 --> 01:29:09,072
Don't you want to come in?

1209
01:29:09,168 --> 01:29:11,472
Everything is the
living room, gentlemen.

1210
01:29:11,568 --> 01:29:14,064
This is modern housing.

1211
01:29:14,448 --> 01:29:19,344
No landlord, no taxes,
no annoying neighbors,

1212
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,744
and not a single leak.

1213
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:24,624
Well, now I'm not so sure.

1214
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:43,440
And to make happiness
complete, no family to interfere.

1215
01:29:44,784 --> 01:29:46,032
Evaristo.

1216
01:29:46,512 --> 01:29:47,856
Marta!

1217
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:02,172
Where did you leave the children?

1218
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,728
Daddy, daddy, daddy!
Daddy, daddy, daddy!

1219
01:30:26,766 --> 01:30:29,524
