1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,400
<i>The evil in this world
chases away the fairies.</i>

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,073
<i>They don't want to see the
destruction of forests,</i>

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,869
<i>mankind's cruelty and selfishness.</i>

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,838
<i>That's why it gets harder
and harder to see a fairy.</i>

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,713
<i>Whenever a child says he
doesn't believe in fairies,</i>

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,956
<i>one of them dies.</i>

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,956
<i>That's why there are so few of them.</i>

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,637
LITTLE MIRACLES

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,192
<i>They are fantastic beings</i>

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,630
<i>who show themselves in the shape of women</i>

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>and are given magical power</i>

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,510
<i>and the gift of foreseeing the future.</i>

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,751
<i>Their main mission is</i>

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,394
<i>to help make the wishes
of others come true.</i>

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,957
Mom, it's Rosalia.

16
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,113
Please, call me.

17
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,992
Signs of life in space,

18
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,195
Lola.

19
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,629
Don't get jealous...

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,115
But there she is.

21
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,117
It's her again.

22
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,794
I have the same dream every night.

23
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,068
I'm in danger and a fairy
godmother saves me.

24
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,635
Do you know

25
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,319
- what that means?
- No.

26
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,433
Before being a mother...

27
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,193
Did you dream of it?

28
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,356
Did you dream of having a child?

29
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,314
I don't remember.

30
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,992
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,474
I'm leaving Lola with you.

32
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,599
- Bye.
- See you later.

33
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,358
Argentine Institute

34
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,272
for Radio-Astronomy.

35
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,150
Search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

36
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,118
Should we call Harvard?

37
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,875
No, move the antenna.

38
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,955
The signal is the same.

39
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,713
It's an interference.

40
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,238
During the trip,

41
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,077
I talked

42
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,639
about my recent

43
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,872
exciting experiences

44
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,754
in the ballrooms devoted

45
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,109
to tango dancing...

46
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,874
- I'll bring some tea.
- I'll help you.

47
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,752
No. Make yourself at home.

48
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,592
You've got a new walking stick.

49
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,638
Do you like it?

50
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,750
It's for when I wear beige.

51
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,078
Two, or have you gained weight?

52
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,474
You have.

53
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,472
How are you doing timewise?

54
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,913
I'd like to try to finish this year.

55
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,799
I have Don Francisco,

56
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,678
but I think I still have time.

57
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,393
Are we going to graduate this year?

58
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,795
It'd be a miracle. Shall we try it?

59
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,439
Shall I open this letter?

60
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,278
No. Later. It must be

61
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
the bank statement.

62
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
What else?

63
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,158
The electricity bill.

64
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,875
A letter.

65
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,516
Sent by P.P.

66
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,428
It's a love letter.

67
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,989
Read it. Go on.

68
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,433
"My dearest beloved..."

69
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,870
Alejandro Casona: "It's forbidden"

70
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,992
to commit suicide in spring."
It must be an older man.

71
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,035
"I don't know what to do with this love."

72
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,919
I did everything I could
to get your address.

73
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,430
I lied, I trembled, I feared.

74
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,270
I don't understand why, if you

75
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,550
don't see me, when you look at me,

76
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,473
I feel something I haven't
felt for a long time.

77
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,750
So many people see without looking.

78
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,035
You don't see.

79
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,509
But no one's ever looked at me this way.

80
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,112
I have an irrepressible desire

81
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,197
"to hold you in my arms..."

82
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,390
It must be a guy from the ballrooms.

83
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,159
"To explore your body"

84
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,878
as if I were the blindest of men.

85
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,193
Pore by pore,

86
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,514
with my hands...

87
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,028
with my tongue...

88
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,908
"with my breath..."

89
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,310
Come on, don't be afraid.

90
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,308
Go on reading.

91
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,149
"I want to stay in your hills..."

92
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,632
rest in your valleys...

93
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,276
get lost in your forests...

94
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,431
suffocate in your thickets...

95
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,269
taste the forbidden fruit

96
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,795
as long as you assure me that,

97
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,918
"when I'm expelled from Paradise
you will come with me."

98
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,634
What a guy!

99
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,913
Isn't it funny how he

100
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,276
mixes geography and sex?

101
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,152
Maps must turn him on.

102
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,679
"If that doesn't happen,"

103
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,797
I'll be glad dancing with you.

104
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,038
For me, your darkness

105
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,151
is my heart's brightest spot.

106
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,551
"I love you, P.P."

107
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,758
He wants to act like a gentleman,

108
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,190
but he is a pig. I like that.

109
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,148
Who could it be?

110
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,318
I'm going dancing on Saturday.

111
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,876
I never go on Saturdays

112
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,150
because men go with their sweethearts.

113
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,271
But I want to try it.

114
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,679
Are you coming with me?

115
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,991
You haven't danced the tango lately.

116
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,918
You must have forgotten how.

117
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,869
Men are asking you to dance.

118
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,395
You don't respond. They look upset.

119
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,119
But how could I...?

120
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,958
Today is Saturday, Rosalia.

121
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,310
The guys from Saturday don't know me.

122
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,952
Let's go to the rest room.

123
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,470
Across the dance floor. I want everybody

124
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,352
to know I am blind.

125
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,558
Your attention, please.

126
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,876
We'll now

127
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,348
start dancing the canyengue tango,

128
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,158
which enlivened Buenos Aires ballrooms

129
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,873
during the 20's.

130
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,877
Charge, my brave ones.

131
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,956
I don't know if it was a good idea.

132
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,876
I'm dancing. I was asked to dance.

133
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,632
And now, a musical interlude.

134
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,518
Pay very close attention, Lola.

135
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,436
There's a behavior that repeats itself.

136
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,388
She appears every morning,

137
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,875
usually between 8:00 and 8:30.

138
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,309
Whereas, in the afternoon, her appearances

139
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,038
are more erratic.

140
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,674
My question is,

141
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,395
where do you think she goes every morning?

142
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,949
Does she go to work?

143
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,198
Does she go to the university?

144
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,719
Who could she be, Lola?

145
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,754
What does your female intuition tell you?

146
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
What's going on?

147
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,873
You're notjealous, huh?

148
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,270
She has something

149
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,959
that grabs my attention,

150
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,832
but I don't know...

151
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,477
Yes, I know you were an opera singer

152
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,591
in a past life.

153
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Do not suffer.

154
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,114
There are too many mysteries in life, Lola.

155
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,116
<i>Fairyland is a mysterious world</i>

156
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,590
<i>that lives side by side with our own.</i>

157
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,391
<i>There's access to it,</i>

158
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,393
<i>safe from our noisy and savage times...</i>

159
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,873
<i>To carry out their missions</i>

160
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,157
<i>in the real world</i>

161
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,749
<i>fairies can make themselves
invisible to humans.</i>

162
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,310
<i>The world is full of them.
They may also</i>

163
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,875
<i>appear in the shapes of humans or animals.</i>

164
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,392
I'm glad you're here.

165
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,312
He's terrible today.

166
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,474
If reading to me bores you, just tell me.

167
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,238
Don't make me waste my time.

168
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,789
I'm sorry. I'm late.

169
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Wait.

170
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,188
Play track 3 of the disc
that's in the machine.

171
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,879
Alessandro Marcello.

172
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,352
<i>It's necessary to destroy
the purpose of bridges...</i>

173
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,399
<i>To cover the landscape
with alien elements...</i>

174
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,312
<i>To straighten by force the
curve of the horizon...</i>

175
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,880
<i>And to moan at experiencing
the abrupt sound</i>

176
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,718
<i>of the mountains...</i>

177
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,558
<i>Very few people love
sceneries that do not exist.</i>

178
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,075
Do you like it?

179
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,999
I don't understand it,

180
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,989
but I'm

181
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
moved.

182
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,909
Forgive me.

183
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,717
<i>As smooth as the touch of a mother,</i>

184
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,512
<i>the afternoon sets.</i>

185
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,439
<i>There is no rain yet,</i>

186
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,275
<i>and the sky is like an imperfect smile</i>

187
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,080
<i>and my awareness of being aware of you</i>

188
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,710
<i>is like a prayer</i>

189
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,034
<i>and knowing that you smile</i>

190
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,675
<i>is like a wilted flower on my chest.</i>

191
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,432
May I borrow this book?

192
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,795
I'll bring it back.

193
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,792
Of course. I'm happy

194
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,270
that you are beginning to like Pessoa.

195
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,553
Mom... It's me Rosalia...

196
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,478
Please, call me.

197
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,236
Are you there... mom?

198
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,439
I want you to come over for dinner.

199
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,316
If you don't like my cooking,

200
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,750
we can order a pizza. But call me.

201
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,998
<i>It's not true. It can't be true.</i>

202
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,752
<i>They were just two coincidences.</i>

203
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,555
I know I have to thank God for this gift

204
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,239
of being a fairy.

205
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,876
But I'm afraid, because I wonder...

206
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,190
Will I be able to fall in love

207
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,476
and have children?

208
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,711
Do you know anything about fairies?

209
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,316
Until last year, our solar system

210
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,670
was thought to be an exception.

211
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,951
We were alone in the universe.

212
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,431
But in 1996,

213
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,318
eight other planetary systems

214
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,715
were discovered.

215
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,873
Frankly, did you ever feel alone?

216
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,395
You shouldn't have.

217
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,393
It is less and less likely

218
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,828
that we are alone.

219
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,309
Just in our galaxy,

220
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,069
there are 500 billion stars.

221
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,908
Can you imagine?

222
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,309
Don't worry.

223
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,352
Me, neither.

224
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,149
Do you know what keeps me awake at night?

225
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,955
Sometimes, I am certain

226
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,357
that the signals are there

227
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,634
but we don't see them as we should.

228
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,792
- Who is it?
- Rosalia...

229
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,553
<i>I don't have a philosophy;</i>

230
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,153
<i>I have feelings.</i>

231
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,076
<i>If I speak about Nature,</i>

232
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,555
<i>it's because I love it.</i>

233
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,718
<i>And those who love never know</i>

234
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,959
<i>what they love, or what love is.</i>

235
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,757
<i>To love is eternal innocence,</i>

236
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,838
<i>and the only innocence,</i>

237
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,559
<i>not to think.</i>

238
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,953
I'd like you to hear
something that I wrote.

239
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,110
In fact, I just adapted a text by Pessoa

240
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,749
to music by Marcello.

241
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,508
You will remember it, song,

242
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,754
to love at an early hour,

243
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,909
one night with closed eyes,

244
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,435
your voice, your voice.

245
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,748
It breaks my heart.

246
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,311
For although you cry,

247
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,957
you sing by my side

248
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,835
and I am all alone.

249
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,478
Can you see me?

250
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,794
See you?

251
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,595
I don't know.

252
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,831
Suddenly, I thought of a miracle.

253
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,749
Come closer.

254
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,638
Don't be afraid.

255
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,429
I want to make a confession.

256
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,389
As I couldn't see you and you

257
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,915
wouldn't dare tell me what you are like,

258
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,751
a love has grown

259
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,756
inside me

260
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,878
so great and immeasurable

261
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,632
that it hurts.

262
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,432
If you don't know what I'm like,

263
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,517
how can you love me?

264
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,635
You don't even know the color of my hair,

265
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,552
or how tall I am.

266
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,516
With no definite shapes...

267
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,959
with no limits...

268
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,758
and without waiting for any reward

269
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,593
this love has been growing
with no boundaries

270
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,195
and it has become a red-hot ember

271
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,197
inside of me...

272
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,833
and it hurts...

273
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,754
This love

274
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,630
has become the only love.

275
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,757
Do you understand?

276
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,713
And this is a love

277
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,797
that only Christ could have felt.

278
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,870
I am only a poor man

279
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,398
who exaggerates his shadows.

280
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,639
Why is God so good to me, Rosalia?

281
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Good?

282
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,432
If I were able to see,

283
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,595
I'd be distracted by shapes

284
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,717
and colors.

285
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,633
Things would be only one way,

286
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,713
the way I'd see them.

287
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,279
But like this,

288
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,235
by not seeing what is outside,

289
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,955
I can only see what is inside, Rosalia.

290
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,790
You can't see the color of my hair,

291
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,269
but you can see inside my soul?

292
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,517
Do you know I'm a fairy godmother?

293
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,791
I never doubted it.

294
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,952
I don't want you to suffer.

295
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,750
I am 5 feet tall.

296
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,594
I'm small,

297
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,396
I have brown hair...

298
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,233
dark eyes

299
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,192
and a funny-looking face.

300
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,871
I'm dark-skinned.

301
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,789
No man would ever find me attractive.

302
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,749
<i>I came to this world on a mission,</i>

303
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,712
<i>and ended up trapped here.</i>

304
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,391
I have to find the way to return...

305
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
How much?

306
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,596
You shouldn't have listened to me.

307
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,717
I am not ready for this exam.

308
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,514
We should have waited a little bit longer.

309
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,076
Calm down. Everything is going
to be all right. I know it.

310
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,433
Only a miracle will make me pass...

311
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,794
Susana Fuentes.

312
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,200
The balls are scattered
all over the place...

313
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,914
Our notes are all mixed up...

314
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,433
If you believe in fate,

315
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,915
maybe you'll understand what happened.

316
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,909
In my 40-year career,

317
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,429
nothing like this has ever happened to me.

318
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,471
If you decided to study,

319
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,079
you didn't do it

320
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,356
to please your parents...

321
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,230
So talk to us about whatever aspect

322
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,078
of Criminal Law you like.

323
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,950
Very well. I am going to talk about

324
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,833
crimes against sexual honor.

325
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,430
In point number one we'll see...

326
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,835
honor as a value in criminal law.

327
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,990
I would like you to talk to us about...

328
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,357
Do you want to ask her anything?

329
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,271
Let's give her a passing grade.

330
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,598
Nature calls.

331
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,316
What a strange day.

332
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,758
Congratulations, Doctor of Law.

333
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,355
Thank you.

334
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,956
Thanks for your help, Rosalia.

335
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,152
Oh, I'm so happy.

336
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
You know,

337
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,077
the best things in my
life started to happen

338
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,759
after I became blind.

339
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,157
Life is very strange, isn't it?

340
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,871
The other day, a man offered

341
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,190
to help me cross the street.

342
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,789
It was a voice that came

343
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,230
from about 3 feet off the ground.

344
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,520
A midget?

345
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,915
No. A midget crossed my path once,

346
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,110
but this one wasn't a midget.

347
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,831
This one took my hand and placed it

348
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,678
on top of something metallic.

349
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,199
A wheelchair.

350
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,279
I crossed the street holding
onto his wheelchair.

351
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,755
God is good to me for allowing me

352
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,354
to enjoy these acts of kindness.

353
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,514
People are good, it's just that

354
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,433
they don't have the chance to show it.

355
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,310
Maybe that's my mission in life...

356
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,796
to make people discover how much

357
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,951
they can love another human being.

358
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,751
I know that after being kind to me,

359
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,831
they feel better...

360
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,719
Closer to God.

361
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,152
Rosalia, Rosalia, you are...

362
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,831
so kind to me,

363
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,998
and I love you so much...

364
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Mom?

365
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,228
Coming...

366
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,357
Who are we mourning today?

367
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,510
It's incense from India. Don't you like it?

368
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,909
Is that all right? I can fix you an egg...

369
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,994
It's not bad.

370
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,838
You've learned something.

371
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,348
What are you eating?

372
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,154
You go straight for the dessert, right?

373
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,190
Strawberries with honey. As a child,

374
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,669
I used to say this was the meal of fairies.

375
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,598
What are you doing now?

376
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,155
Are you still working in the supermarket?

377
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,518
Yes. I also read to blind people.

378
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,799
Read to blind people?

379
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,076
Is that a job? Reading to people?

380
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,833
Do they pay you well?

381
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,710
Nothing. I'm a volunteer.

382
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,708
Volunteer...

383
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,074
Of course, because you're
rolling in dough...

384
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,192
You're just like your old man.
I saw Aunt Cata yesterday.

385
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,595
Your father phoned her.

386
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,357
He's living in a village.

387
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,675
He must've found some other foolish woman.

388
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,479
It seems the bastard has a kid.

389
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,592
What's so funny?

390
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,789
Nothing.

391
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,991
I'm just glad he's okay.

392
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,632
You sure are crazy.

393
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,189
I hope it's taught you a lesson.

394
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,315
You know what to expect from men.

395
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Enjoy them.

396
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,318
Don't let yourself be fooled.

397
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,799
They get you pregnant,

398
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,998
have a good laugh,

399
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,112
and then they leave,

400
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,159
and from then on you're
the slave of your child.

401
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,428
They keep on having fun

402
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,752
and you're stuck with the kid.

403
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,952
<i>Mom, I have something to tell you.</i>

404
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,073
<i>Your daughter's a fairy.</i>

405
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,515
<i>Ask for a wish. I'll make it come true.</i>

406
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,511
<i>I may be able to repay you</i>

407
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,035
<i>for all the trouble I've caused you.</i>

408
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,515
Mr. Bermudez, please?

409
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,508
His daughter.

410
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,909
Hello, Bermudez?

411
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,512
Do you remember me, you bastard?

412
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,519
You abandoned me when I was 8 years old.

413
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,475
Hello. Dad.

414
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,271
It's Rosalia. Your daughter.

415
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,111
No, I'm not calling you to fight.

416
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,799
I just wanted you to take me out
for some ice cream.

417
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,909
Dad.

418
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,119
<i>There are times and places</i>

419
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,157
<i>where the two worlds meet.</i>

420
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,759
There are doors

421
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,638
to that magical world.

422
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,477
Between the earth and the sea.

423
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,598
Between one place and another.

424
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,551
Between two blinks of an eye.

425
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,240
- Shall we take some cold milk?
- Fine.

426
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,838
Another letter from P.P.

427
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,236
Read it to me after tea.

428
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Rosalia, tell me...

429
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,512
When the fairy saves you,

430
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,677
does she always say the same thing?

431
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,113
I don't know. I can't hear what she says.

432
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,638
And what's that about a song?

433
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,715
When I awake I sing a song

434
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,394
I never learned in a language I don't know.

435
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,515
Could you sing it now?

436
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,916
No. I can only sing it at that moment.

437
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,589
Are you sure you're awake when you sing it?

438
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,479
Do you mean

439
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,872
that I think I'm awake

440
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,792
but I'm really still dreaming?

441
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,073
Did you ever sleepwalk?

442
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Yes.

443
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,868
When I was a little girl.

444
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,871
But my mom cured me

445
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,076
by slapping me when I was sleepwalking

446
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,912
in the house and mumbling things

447
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,672
that no one understood.

448
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,789
How do you know when you're really awake?

449
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,719
How do I know if I'm talking to you,
or I'm dreaming it?

450
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,599
Do you have to go pee?

451
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Yes, a little bit...

452
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,479
Then it's not a dream.

453
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,908
I'm intrigued by that stuff about the song.

454
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,120
I'm going to lend you my tape recorder.

455
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,432
Remind yourself

456
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,955
that you must be sure to turn it on.

457
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,590
Carola Jalife, 717-1211-

458
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,714
<i>There's something that
fairies cannot stop doing.</i>

459
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
<i>Dancing.</i>

460
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,112
<i>Fairies who live in groups</i>

461
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,554
<i>wear green.</i>

462
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,268
<i>Sometimes, they wear a red cap
with a green feather.</i>

463
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,358
<i>Lone fairies always</i>

464
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,794
<i>wear red.</i>

465
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,429
<i>Maybe I'm not alone here.</i>

466
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,030
<i>Maybe there are other fairies.</i>

467
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,513
<i>I'm stupid and vain.</i>

468
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,637
<i>How could I be the only one?</i>

469
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,996
<i>But would they know?</i>

470
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,352
Did you study languages?

471
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,999
But you must've learned a song...
in English maybe?

472
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,995
No. Why?

473
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,435
What you were singing sounded like.

474
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,431
English to me.

475
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,396
So I called a friend

476
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,790
who is a language teacher
and knows a lot...

477
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,672
And well... it's not English.

478
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,474
What is it then?

479
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,308
It could be a Celtic dialect.

480
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,990
She's going to check it out,

481
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,755
but she thinks it could be a language

482
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,474
that was spoken in Ireland

483
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,392
hundreds of years ago.

484
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,270
Now tell me where you learned that!

485
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,430
Thank you very much, dancers.

486
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,074
And now, a musical interlude.

487
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,555
Do you want to have a drink with us?

488
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
Champagne?

489
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,514
No, thank you.
I have my orange juice over there.

490
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,153
We'll order another one.

491
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,278
Don't break the atmosphere.

492
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,755
Waiter!

493
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,950
How would making love feel to a blind girl?

494
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,313
I don't think it'd be much different.
Just think...

495
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,398
How long do you keep your eyes open
when you're doing it?

496
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,114
Looking is the least
important thing, right?

497
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,512
An orange juice, please.

498
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,393
And for a guy to do it

499
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,993
with a blind girl?

500
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,832
The unpunished surprise of the hands...

501
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,040
No, you idiot.

502
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,509
She is the one who makes love in Braille.

503
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,359
A ball over here, another
ball over there, and...

504
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,314
Oh, my God,

505
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,911
what have we got here?

506
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,751
Forgive these freaks. What's your name?

507
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,038
The blind woman is related to you?

508
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,271
She's my best friend.

509
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,038
I read for her.

510
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,152
We've just graduated as lawyers.

511
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,196
I mean,

512
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,078
she has. Isn't that great?

513
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,039
A lawyer? That's interesting.

514
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,988
There are so many lawyers
who don't see shit.

515
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,436
At least she won't hide the fact.

516
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,999
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

517
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,118
She's a good woman.

518
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,191
And she gave her best.

519
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,120
Just try to imagine
studying and being blind.

520
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,153
Could you do it?

521
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,476
I didn't mean to make fun of her.

522
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,796
It's the champagne.

523
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,433
Let's dance.

524
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,279
We're nice girls.

525
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,993
A little wacky, but

526
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,474
nice people.

527
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
I know.

528
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,795
Really? Do we look like good girls?

529
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,476
You probably won't go to heaven,

530
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,710
but you won't go to hell, either.

531
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
What do you do?

532
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,358
Whatever we can. I'm a secretary.

533
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,559
My name's Gladys.

534
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,593
I say my name's Gladys, but
my real name's Selena.

535
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,036
Of course. Fairies are very careful

536
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,593
about revealing

537
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,512
their real names.

538
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,831
If people knew your real name,

539
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,917
you could be the victim of a spell.

540
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,793
Is there vodka in yourjuice?

541
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,713
What are their names?

542
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,194
Marisel and Natalia. They're actresses.

543
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,559
Actresses? They work on TV?

544
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,591
They work wherever they can,

545
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,149
but they're not famous. Not yet.

546
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,111
And you?

547
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,360
I'm a good fairy.

548
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,309
I work as a cashier at a supermarket.

549
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,512
We're going out for a drink.
Do you want to come?

550
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,789
I'm working tomorrow.

551
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,229
Me, too. Come on!

552
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,636
Sure you'll be okay?

553
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,836
The engineer will take me home.

554
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,111
Pino Paparella, engineer, nice to meet you.

555
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,033
Rosi... Pino Paparella. P.P.

556
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,995
I think he's the one who sends the letters.

557
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,359
You look great.

558
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,272
I wish I could bite your lips.

559
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,232
I'll kick you so hard in the balls

560
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,271
that you'll regret it, asshole!

561
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,913
You are a real pig, Selena.

562
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,638
Selena is the name of a fairy.

563
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,231
Yes, of a bitchy fairy.

564
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,752
What are you drinking?

565
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,999
An orange juice.

566
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,315
How boring.

567
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,596
Have champagne with us.

568
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,557
Do you always drink champagne?

569
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,796
I haven't read that in any book.

570
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,118
Rosalia, how do you like guys?

571
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,510
- Guys?
- What kind of men do you like?

572
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,438
Young blokes... older guys?

573
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,229
Intellectuals? Athletes? You must like

574
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,396
the intellectuals, right?

575
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,790
Those who don't start petting right away.

576
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,712
I like those, too.

577
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,708
Come on! You like them all!

578
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,672
Do you like those two guys over at the bar?

579
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,553
You don't like men?

580
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,752
Listen, it doesn't matter to us.

581
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,112
That's not it...

582
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,032
I've never had a boyfriend.

583
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,599
You've never

584
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,358
had a relationship?

585
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,749
Well, once a boy invited me out.

586
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,758
We went to the movies

587
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,310
but then he sort of got on my nerves.

588
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,514
I don't think...
he was an intellectual guy.

589
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,637
This can't be true!

590
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,434
You're still a virgin?

591
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,800
No, a girl.

592
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,633
No, a girl, what a scoop!

593
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,519
Any TV station would take you:
"A virgin in Argentina".

594
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,234
Don't pay any attention to them.

595
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,198
You never wanted a man
to grab you like that?

596
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,910
I don't think I'm

597
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,720
the type of woman that attracts men.

598
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,036
What do you mean? You're so pretty!

599
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,593
- No...
- Yes, you are!

600
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,751
You are very pretty.

601
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,712
But you still don't realize it.

602
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,038
Let your hair down.
May I? There.

603
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Look at those lips.

604
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,799
You know what you need?

605
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,312
Do you have any dough to spend
on clothes and a new hairdo?

606
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,238
I've got some money saved up.

607
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,793
- What for?
- I don't know.

608
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,712
Shall we make a babe out of her?

609
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,871
Don't be stupid. You'll love it.

610
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,431
<i>They don't know they're fairies.</i>

611
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,310
<i>Many die without knowing it.</i>

612
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,711
<i>Not daring to know it.</i>

613
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,193
<i>Does it matter?</i>

614
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,593
<i>They behave like fairies,
the way they helped me.</i>

615
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,714
<i>We fairies are here to
help make other people's</i>

616
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,711
<i>wishes come true.</i>

617
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,714
Oh, my God!

618
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,435
What if I'm punished for being so vain?

619
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,630
And what if from now on,

620
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,119
instead of being a fairy,

621
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,589
I become a whore?

622
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,832
Ah, you... Are you still

623
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,672
having those strange dreams?

624
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,995
No, not anymore.

625
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
Grandma.

626
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,040
What do you want?

627
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,433
You forgot this.

628
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,475
It's not mine.
That would cost half my pension.

629
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,108
How could I ever buy it?

630
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,836
Grandma... Take it.

631
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,911
Do you want me to pinch it?

632
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,758
Here's your sales slip.

633
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,394
Is she the same one?

634
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,520
Yeah.

635
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,518
What did she do to herself?

636
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,275
She looks super.

637
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,475
<i>To live is to belong to someone.</i>

638
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,435
<i>To die is to belong to someone.</i>

639
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,429
<i>To live and to die are the same thing.</i>

640
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,589
<i>To live is to belong to
someone on the outside</i>

641
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,519
<i>and to die is to belong
to someone on the inside.</i>

642
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,350
<i>The two things are similar.</i>

643
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,869
<i>Life is life, and death is death.</i>

644
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,354
<i>Life is the outer side of death.</i>

645
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,312
<i>The outer side is always</i>

646
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,391
<i>more real than the inner side.</i>

647
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,908
<i>Therefore the outer side is what you see...</i>

648
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,436
Now wait... What else are you wearing?

649
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,555
Is that a cotton skirt?

650
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,473
It's cotton, and it has a flower pattern.

651
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,433
How pretty! I've got a surprise for you.

652
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,032
You finished knitting it!

653
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,316
Yes. I hope it fits you.

654
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,593
Wear it when you go dancing today.

655
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,440
You look beautiful.

656
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,389
Now you have to act up
a little bit, play...

657
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,397
Be different according

658
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,635
to circumstances.

659
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,636
Just as when you

660
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,956
choose a dress or a hairdo,

661
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,957
you choose

662
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,789
a personality,

663
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,190
depending on the situation.

664
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,630
Let's say you want to look intellectual,

665
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,034
as the guy

666
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,157
you like might notice you that way.

667
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,793
How would you act?

668
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,554
I'd buy a pair of glasses.

669
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,034
Try these on.

670
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,395
You look like a bore like that.

671
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,034
Intellectual, but... New age.

672
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,071
You believe in fairies,

673
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,157
reincarnation and all that bullshit.

674
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,195
Now, the opposite. You're in a dull place

675
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,868
full of intellectuals.

676
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,237
In that case, what you would need is to
look more seductive.

677
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
Seductive?

678
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,231
You don't charge for doing it,

679
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,630
but it shows that you like it.

680
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,960
That I like what?

681
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,315
That you like men, Rosalia.

682
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,790
How do you make a guy

683
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,190
you like pay attention to you?

684
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,638
This never fails. Look,

685
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,793
eyes half open.

686
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,517
Very subtle. No need to exaggerate.

687
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,438
But take advantage of your pretty mouth.

688
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,868
Come on.

689
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,389
You'll soon see how easy it is

690
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,392
to pretend that you like it.

691
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,154
I think our missiors over, girls.

692
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,112
Now you'll go back to fairyland?

693
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,353
- Nothing.
- You're

694
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
ready now, girl.

695
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,555
Ready for what?

696
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,593
<i>Drinking</i>

697
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,319
<i>won't help you get ideas.</i>

698
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,074
<i>Helping a writer isn't easy for a fairy.</i>

699
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,713
<i>I'll tell you a story and
you'll write it. Come closer.</i>

700
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,038
<i>That woman is interfering.</i>

701
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,871
<i>She must be a bad person.</i>

702
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,513
They want to fire you.

703
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,797
Maybe I'm not a good fairy.

704
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,712
Maybe I'm a witch.

705
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,713
My card's not there.

706
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,031
Mr. Garcia Cozzi wants to talk to you.

707
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,035
Aunt Cata,

708
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,639
how are you?

709
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,278
Fine, I'm okay.

710
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,516
Well, I was fired today...

711
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,550
Well, yes... No, but I'm fine.

712
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,469
A boyfriend?

713
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,233
Not yet, but soon.

714
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,840
Auntie, Mom told me you talked to my dad.

715
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,111
Didrt he tell you where he lives?

716
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,034
In La Pampa?

717
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,438
Did he give you a phone number?

718
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,871
Mr. Bermudez, please.

719
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,749
His daughter.

720
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,279
Gin, please.

721
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,392
You are a woman.

722
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,148
Did you forget what I am?

723
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,273
What can you say in a case like this?
"I'm sorry?"

724
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,675
Come on.

725
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,553
How do you defend yourself from the
passage of time?

726
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,714
I don't know,

727
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,075
and besides, it's useless.

728
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,479
I run and run but always end up
in the same place...

729
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,319
where things are waiting
for me to get old...

730
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,232
And I love life so much, Rosalia.

731
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,235
I can't stand the idea

732
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,271
that everything's always dying.

733
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,228
One day you notice that you no longer love

734
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,034
the person who's beside you.

735
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,432
And the other one can see it

736
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,474
and you're like a trapped animal.

737
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,318
And all you can do is get older

738
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,229
and more decrepit day by day...

739
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,438
And that's what frightens me...

740
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,879
I'm not a bad guy.

741
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,557
I just get frightened, that's all.

742
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,713
And then you have to run away.

743
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,956
What can you do when

744
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,475
everything around you is falling apart?

745
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,791
You don't know what it's like

746
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,150
on a winter evening,

747
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,191
watching TV with a woman

748
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,512
and all of a sudden you think,

749
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,671
"I'll die sitting by this womars side".

750
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,318
What the hell has that got to do

751
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,351
with love? Tell me.

752
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,951
You'll die all the same, Dad...

753
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,836
but alone, and you know it.

754
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,675
I don't want do give up without a fight

755
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,838
in the face of death.
I want to keep dreaming.

756
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,997
Can't you keep dreaming by the side

757
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,071
of a woman you loved...

758
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,269
and who you could keep loving?

759
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,796
She chose you to spend

760
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,309
the rest of her life with.

761
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,831
Maybe, for her, there's nothing

762
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,156
more important than that.

763
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,633
To die by your side.

764
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,353
Arert you touched by that?

765
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,073
And you are a woman...

766
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,032
Is that why you left us?

767
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,160
If I'd been a boy, you
wouldn't have left us?

768
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,478
I had a son.

769
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,874
Little Roberto.

770
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,718
No, another one,

771
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
before...

772
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,150
When I left your mother...

773
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,555
I mean, when I left you both,

774
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,076
I lived with another woman,

775
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,759
and we had a child.

776
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,948
A boy.

777
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,556
I never betrayed you, Rosalia.

778
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,430
<i>Dad, I want you to know something.</i>

779
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,992
<i>Your daughter's a fairy.</i>

780
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,838
<i>Ask for a wish. I'll make it</i>

781
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
<i>come true for you.</i>

782
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,829
<i>But don't ask me</i>

783
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,678
<i>to stop time.</i>

784
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,755
<i>I don't think I could do that, Dad.</i>

785
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,636
This is Rosalia, my daughter.

786
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,633
Give her some coffee.

787
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,910
I think she's had too much to drink.

788
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,519
Do you hate him?

789
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,198
He's a good guy,

790
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,678
but he gets frightened.

791
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,473
I wish I could make him happy.

792
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,477
I don't think he's ever been happy.

793
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,951
He doesn't allow himself to be happy.

794
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,234
He's selfish... fucking selfish.

795
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,676
Can you imagine living with a man

796
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,791
who's always looking at you

797
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,878
as if you were responsible

798
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,593
for the passage of time?

799
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,073
What your old man can't stand are mirrors.

800
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,629
The bastard thinks we women are

801
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,193
the mirror

802
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,674
of his own aging.

803
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,719
Do you think he'll do it again?

804
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,750
Whenever he says he's going

805
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,190
to the pub or into town,

806
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,599
you stay behind thinking,

807
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,874
"He is going to do it".

808
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,392
"This time he'll do it."

809
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,239
"He won't come back."

810
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,680
Because

811
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,913
you know he's going to do it.

812
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,119
She's sad.

813
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,633
<i>If I'm a fairy godmother,</i>

814
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,631
<i>and I can make people's wishes come true,</i>

815
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,909
<i>why can't I make people happy?</i>

816
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,798
<i>What kind of a fairy am I?</i>

817
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,439
<i>Maybe I'm just a fake.</i>

818
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,273
<i>I know a few tricks,</i>

819
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,480
<i>that's all.</i>

820
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,554
<i>How does one manage to live over there?</i>

821
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,634
What could've happened to her, Lola?

822
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,799
Do you think she's sick?

823
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,635
27...

824
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,829
27?

825
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,992
Lola, come... Come on, let's go.

826
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,590
There's nobody here, Lola.

827
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,315
8.

828
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,155
I want that number.

829
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,513
<i>The powers were granted to me
to help other people.</i>

830
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,358
<i>If I use them for my own benefit,
I'll be punished.</i>

831
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,033
<i>For my next mission,
I'll be sent as a frog,</i>

832
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,638
<i>or a fish... Or even worse...</i>

833
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,159
<i>as a boy.</i>

834
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,918
This number will be the winner.

835
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,789
Then I congratulate you.

836
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,550
No, I can't keep it.

837
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,714
I shouldn't.

838
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,115
I have a good friend who's a priest.

839
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,555
He's founded a home for street kids.

840
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,228
He really performs miracles to feed them.

841
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,670
Your faith is so strong that you

842
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,070
make me feel everything

843
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,952
you believe is true.

844
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,472
Maybe, you are a good fairy,

845
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,352
as you claim.

846
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,193
No sane soul

847
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,192
can really see a fairy.

848
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,555
Therefore, those who can see

849
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,228
are no better off than I am.

850
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,308
Nevertheless, I've come to realize

851
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,031
that when you come here...

852
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,595
A very special light

853
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,916
appears in my darkness.

854
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,670
How strange life is, Rosalia.

855
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,671
How marvelously mysterious.

856
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,517
- See you on Tuesday.
- See you.

857
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,113
The lottery ticket ends with a 3?

858
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,989
It's 9,333?

859
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,709
How did you know?

860
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,990
I would've bought it myself.

861
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,228
What's his name?

862
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,674
Whatever you like. He's
going to be your son.

863
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,835
Dear Pino, I thank you

864
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,429
for your new habit

865
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,473
of writing letters to me.

866
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,629
I don't know if I'd dare to tell you

867
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,798
these things

868
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,117
in person.

869
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,759
They seem less indiscreet

870
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,355
on a piece of paper.

871
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,758
No, I'm fine.

872
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,509
For the first time I understood

873
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,109
what the fairy said in my dreams.

874
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,913
What did she say to you?

875
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,160
Death...

876
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,433
does not exist.

877
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,315
Dad?

878
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,394
She left.

879
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,395
She took all her stuff with her,

880
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,238
and I don't care.

881
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,990
But that bitch

882
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,792
took little Roberto with her.

883
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,993
She's not a bad person.

884
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,359
She's afraid, that's all.

885
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,873
Afraid of what?

886
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,073
Stop drinking, Dad.
Why don't you lie down in my bed?

887
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,035
No, dear. I'll go find a hotel.

888
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,431
I'm a little confused.

889
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,271
This has never happened to me before.

890
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,351
Besides being confused,

891
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,755
you're a little drunk... and tired.

892
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,035
Would you like something to eat?

893
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,151
I make good fried eggs.

894
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,516
Or we could order a pizza.

895
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,153
What're you talking about?

896
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,600
Dad... Calm down. You'll find them.

897
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,270
That's not the problem.
It's just that...

898
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,632
Why don't you hate me?

899
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,154
Even if I hated you, I'd still help you.

900
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,909
That's the way I am.

901
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,708
A saint.

902
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,834
A good fairy.

903
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,074
Cover yourself.

904
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,596
I think you have a temperature.

905
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,717
Drink this. It'll make you sweat.

906
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,478
No. Have you got some brandy?

907
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,633
No, Dad. You've already had

908
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,954
too much to drink.

909
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,752
Forgive me, Rosalia.

910
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,473
I'm sorry, my daughter.

911
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,559
Sleep, Dad.

912
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,954
Just sleep, and everything
will be all right.

913
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,399
<i>Once upon a time, there
was a fairy godmother...</i>

914
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,314
<i>who came down to Earth on a mission</i>

915
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,875
<i>and was trapped here.</i>

916
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,391
<i>Fairies lose their</i>

917
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,192
<i>immortality here.</i>

918
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,668
<i>The fairy had lost</i>

919
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,035
<i>her magical gift.</i>

920
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,598
<i>She was very sad</i>

921
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,154
<i>because of the unfairness
of the human world.</i>

922
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,233
<i>There was very little
she could do about it.</i>

923
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,358
<i>One day, she decided to stop trying</i>

924
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,676
<i>to get back to her own world.</i>

925
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,396
<i>But she wanted something very special</i>

926
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,795
<i>to happen to her.</i>

927
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,709
<i>No more little tricks, she said to herself.</i>

928
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,516
<i>Let's see if we are able</i>

929
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,314
<i>to perform a real miracle.</i>

930
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,793
<i>A big miracle.</i>

931
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,199
<i>And one day,</i>

932
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,237
<i>the big miracle took place.</i>

933
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,188
And what happened then?
