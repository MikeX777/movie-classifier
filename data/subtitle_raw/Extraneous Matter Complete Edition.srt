1
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,660
Here we go.

2
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,700
You don't gotta see him.

3
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,910
But you will.

4
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,960
I won't.

5
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,710
The guy I met on the app is married.

6
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,620
Cheating's cool.

7
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,750
Not at all!

8
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,550
Jesus. Masahide said he
wants to see me again.

9
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Guy's 80. How much drive can he have?

10
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,770
He gave you 16 million
yen so don't complain.

11
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,890
Tell him you're at a funeral.

12
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,900
I did that already.

13
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,270
You have other relatives.
Just keep it going.

14
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,070
True.

15
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,360
Well, I've done in 90 people so far.

16
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,360
Awesome. A serial killer!

17
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,310
Maybe I'll pull in 20 million this time.

18
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,850
20 mill? I'll do that in a year.

19
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,490
Really?

20
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,160
Probably in half a year.

21
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,530
For sure.

22
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,110
Wanna bet?

23
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,450
On what?

24
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,730
I can take a vacation.

25
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,950
Take me!

26
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,710
I wanna go.

27
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
Let's go!

28
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,590
Where'll you take us?

29
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,470
How about abroad?

30
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Thanks. I'll be back.

31
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,420
<i>Extraneous Matter</i>

32
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,990
It gets kinda confusing.

33
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,180
Don't screw it up and send
it to the wrong person again.

34
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,790
Even so, Adone is good at sidestepping.

35
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
Adone here!

36
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,190
She knows every trick in the book.

37
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,170
She's a smooth operator.

38
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,480
Fancy work should reflect on sales more.

39
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Alright, I got 100,000 points!

40
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,210
Yes!

41
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,630
Thank you!

42
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,760
Thank you!

43
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,380
Yes!

44
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,340
Thanks.

45
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,100
I'll be back.

46
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,740
It can't be that bad.

47
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
It's disgusting!

48
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,450
He can't be that bad.

49
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,160
But he's so utterly hot!

50
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,790
See! He's irresistible!

51
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,660
Today, like any other day,
has been so damn unremarkable.

52
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,610
Welcome.

53
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,100
Long time no see.

54
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,690
Yeah.

55
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,080
Hi, we're serving dinner menu...

56
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,450
Coffee, please.

57
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,330
Sure thing.

58
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
What's up?

59
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,540
How are you?

60
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,060
Not too bad, how'bout you?

61
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,550
Same.

62
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,110
I see. Are you working?

63
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,850
Yep.

64
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,780
Same place?

65
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
Which one?

66
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,310
The record shop.

67
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,190
Yeah.

68
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,570
Oh yeah?

69
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,920
Here is your coffee, Sir.

70
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,270
- So, what's up?
- I've moved.

71
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,420
To where?

72
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,980
Higashi-Kitazawa.

73
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,690
One station further, huh?

74
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,310
Yep.

75
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,820
You could've gone a lot further.

76
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,700
But I really like the area.

77
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
I know.

78
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,120
Got a bidet toilet, too.

79
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,170
Have you?

80
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,730
- So, what's up?
- One night,

81
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,730
I came home and found it.

82
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,210
What is it?

83
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,480
Put it away.

84
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,930
What's that thing?

85
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
Dunno.

86
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,520
It was there when I came home.

87
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,150
Just like that?

88
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
Just like that.

89
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,900
Well, that's...

90
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,270
I was scared.

91
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,750
I almost wet myself.

92
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,200
Can I see it again?

93
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,860
Sure.

94
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,010
Stop it.

95
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,520
You don't touch there.

96
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Does it bite?

97
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,600
Nope.

98
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,480
Good.

99
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,940
It's pretty gentle.

100
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,870
One parfait.

101
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,840
That's random.

102
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,970
It's not for me,
for this little fella.

103
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,310
What, parfait?

104
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,690
It has a sweet tooth.

105
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,610
Loves strawberries.

106
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,190
Sure thing.

107
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,650
Don't do that.

108
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,460
You and your prudishness.

109
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,540
So?

110
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,340
You haven't changed a bit.

111
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,220
You know, when I first saw it

112
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,310
I found it utterly disgusting.

113
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,310
But it grew on me and
now I find it charming.

114
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,070
I don't know how to put it,

115
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,740
but I think I can look after it
if I'm with you.

116
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,910
I know I was a jerk back then.

117
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,820
Here you are,

118
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,670
your...parfait.

119
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,250
Wait.

120
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,720
Open wide.

121
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,490
You're right!

122
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,740
Is it nice?

123
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,960
Look, how happy it looks!

124
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,130
It's kind of cute.

125
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,490
Right?

126
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,700
Do you want more?

127
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,800
Relax, will you?

128
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,090
Can I feed it?

129
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,300
Don't spill it.

130
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,230
Isn't it adorable?

131
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,840
Cutest thing ever.

132
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,620
Do you want more?

133
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,260
Alright, little one, you win.

134
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,790
Stop that!

135
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,640
Yummy, isn't it?

136
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,510
My little pumpkin.

137
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,540
<i>Coexistence</i>

138
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,570
<i>Propagation</i>

139
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,270
What are you doing?

140
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,530
It's just said “Help me.”

141
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,820
Where are you taking it?

142
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,770
I can't do that job anymore.

143
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,190
I know what you mean, it's gross.

144
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,360
But if we refuse,
the factory won't...

145
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,660
IS that still alive?

146
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,280
Yes.

147
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,210
"I want to live."

148
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,380
He's saying: "I want to live"

149
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,920
So you understand him?

150
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,830
Yes.

151
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,840
You think he'll eat?

152
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,720
Open wide.

153
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,970
“I don’t like spicy food.”

154
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,400
H...hey, stop that, will you?

155
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,400
"Looks yummy." he said.

156
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,410
He said what? That's crazy!

157
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
No eating! All right?

158
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,660
No way! You hear me?

159
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh my god,

160
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,540
don't eat it! Hands off, you!

161
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,020
You can let him go.

162
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,950
What if we get caught?

163
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,240
We'll be arrested.

164
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,050
But wouldn't we hate it
if we were him?

165
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,260
To be squashed alive, right?

166
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,980
Thank you, sir.

167
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,120
He's saying "Oh shit!"

168
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,000
How did they find out?

169
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,920
I called them.

170
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,790
What for?

171
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,250
It's against the law.

172
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,580
Isn't it?

173
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,720
They're coming!

174
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,030
We're done for.

175
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,160
What the...

176
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,630
Huh?

177
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,460
He's vanished.

178
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,690
What did he say then?

179
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,650
I bet he said...

180
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,700
something so awesome.

181
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,030
Actually...

182
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,560
I never understood him.

183
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,770
Thanks for the food.

184
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,250
Next up,
"Where have those 'matters' gone?"

185
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:09,970
Since those 'matters', which infested
the whole world, all vanished that day,

186
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:15,850
with a flash of light and screaming,
none have been found anywhere.

187
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:21,570
The reason for the infestation and
the disappearance remain a mystery.

188
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,070
What's your opinion on this?

189
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,900
I'm baffled...

190
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,120
Things always occur suddenly
without any warning, then

191
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,460
they go away suddenly.

192
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,630
Life consistently remains
impartially absurd.

193
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,300
What's significant about that?
I don't know.

194
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:31,970
When something starts to flow
and you're in it,

195
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,720
you may try fight against it.

196
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,350
Or you may go with the flow.

197
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,440
When people see you struggle,
some would cry for you,

198
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,650
and some would laugh at you.

199
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,240
Welcome.

200
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,290
A beer.

201
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,250
- A beer.
- It's five dollars.

202
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,470
Welcome.

203
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,990
- A beer.
- Sure. It's five dollars.

204
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,920
See you, then.

205
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,760
Excuse me!

206
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,900
You take care.

207
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,660
