1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,959
My name is Turkish.

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,295
Funny name for an Englishman, I know.

3
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:41,296
My parents were on an airplane together
when it crashed. That's how they met.

4
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:46,175
And then they named me like that airplane
that was Turkish.

5
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,557
And this is Tommy.

6
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,268
He tells everyone he was named
after the tommy gun.

7
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,940
But it was actually named after
of a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.

8
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,485
For as long as I can remember, I've always known Tommy.
He's my partner.

9
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,405
That doesn't mean
we're walking around holding hands.

10
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:08,660
It means I'm always trying to get him out
out of the messes he gets me into.

11
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:12,121
I keep him strict.
So he doesn't lose his sense of smell.

12
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:15,291
But really, he's like a brother to me.

13
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:19,211
What do I know about diamonds?
I do fist fights.

14
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:23,090
Just a week ago, I was throwing fist fights.
and enjoying life, and then suddenly.

15
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:26,093
What do I know about diamonds?

16
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:29,138
I think they come from Antwerp, don't you?

17
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:32,683
-Khayyam, are you going to listen to me?
-Do we have a choice?

18
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:36,646
You didn't have to take it literally.

19
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,649
Well, that beautiful story of Adam and Eve.

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,984
There's a deep moral in it.

21
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:45,984
...but to demand that a grown man,
to believe that?

22
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:50,075
What's the matter?

23
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,244
Well, what's the matter?

24
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,873
What do you want me to do,
to drop my pants already?

25
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,834
All right, come on in.

26
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:02,587
It's a beautiful story.

27
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,840
That's all. Just a story.

28
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,511
The Catholic religion is based
on mistranslation.

29
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,222
That's enough. Reuben, say something.

30
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:15,016
Listen to me. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story, the whole thing.

31
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:17,102
The point is that in the translation of the Septuagint.
of the Septuagint,

32
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,521
which in Hebrew means
"young woman,"

33
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,898
translated into Greek as "virgin."

34
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,567
It was easy to make a mistake,

35
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:29,073
...because there's a very slight
difference in pronunciation.

36
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,543
Out of this error grew a prophecy:

37
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:45,673
"A virgin shall bear and bear us a son."

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,969
Do you understand? People's attention
the word "virgin" has caught people's attention.

39
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,432
It's not every day a virgin
gets pregnant and gives birth.

40
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:14,744
But let that prophecy
for a couple hundred years.

41
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:18,913
and the result will be
a holy catholic church.

42
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:22,250
Oh, hey, what are you trying to say now?

43
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:25,128
What I'm trying to say is,
that even if something is written,

44
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,921
it doesn't mean
that that's the way it really is.

45
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:30,922
But that's their hope.
And who cares if it's true or fiction?

46
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,720
-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear it anymore.

47
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:37,641
Anyway, who are we here to see?

48
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:41,019
-Michaela.
-Hello?

49
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,520
Mutti.

50
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:46,521
Rudy! Rood!
Rood, Rood, let them in, please.

51
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:52,405
Rood, it's all right, run them.

52
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,657
-Michael. -Mutti.

53
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:58,287
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?

54
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:08,834
Get down on the floor!

55
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,798
On the floor!

56
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,299
Get down!

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,969
On the fucking floor!

58
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,222
Get down! Get the fuck down!

59
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:22,223
On the floor! Get down! Get down!

60
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:27,898
Get down, I said!

61
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,899
-Time.
-Seven minutes.

62
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:37,697
Where's the rock?

63
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:41,787
Where's the rock?

64
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:45,788
Where's the rock?

65
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:53,587
Michael, where's the rock?

When does your plane leave?

80
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,471
In 20 minutes.

81
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:26,471
Give me your gun.

82
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,819
If in London.

83
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,446
you're gonna need a gun,

84
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:44,447
call this number.

85
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:49,288
-Boris.
-Boris.

86
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,289
He'll get you everything you need.

87
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,342
Is it okay to hit like that?

88
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:05,556
It's an underground fist fight, Tommy.
It's not a tickle contest.

89
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,641
What these guys are doing
hurting each other.

90
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:10,810
What's up with the sausage, Charlie?

91
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,105
Two minutes, Turkish.

92
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:18,106
Look at that. Well, how am I supposed
I'm supposed to do business sitting in this?

93
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,861
Okay, we need the right office.

94
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:23,072
I need a new motor home.
And you're gonna get it for me.

95
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:25,366
Why me?

96
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,493
Well, you know about motor homes.

97
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,245
Why would I do that?

98
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:32,874
You spent the whole summer in one of these. Which means
you know more about them than I do.

99
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,336
And the price has to be right,
so you don't have to sell your pants.

100
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:39,422
What's wrong with this one?

101
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,507
There's nothing wrong with that, Tommy.

102
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,551
It's all good.

103
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm just not quite sure about the color choice.

104
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,391
I've already made all the arrangements.
All you have to do is go and pick him up.

105
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:53,478
Here's the address.

106
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,813
But it's a campground.

107
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:59,814
Here's 10 tons, and it would be really nice
to get some change.

108
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
-What's up with the sausage, Charlie? -What's up with the sausage?
-Five minutes, Turkish.

109
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,576
Five minutes ago, you said
that it would be ready in two minutes.

110
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,495
What are they, gypsies or something?

111
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:13,414
I fucking hate gypsies.

112
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:17,415
What a sensitive boy you are, Tommy.

113
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,339
Fuck me. Hold me tight.

114
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,175
-What's that?
-It's my belt, Turkish.

115
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:26,761
No, Tommy. You got a gun in your pants.

116
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:30,098
-What's a gun doing in your pants? -What's a gun doing in your pants?
-It's for protection.

117
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:31,599
To protect me from who?

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,643
From the Nazis?

119
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:37,063
Aren't you afraid you're gonna shoot your balls off
when you sit down?

120
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,525
-Where'd you get it?
-Boris Razor.

121
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:43,861
Boris is the fucking
tricky-ass Russian?

122
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:47,239
It's a little heavy, don't you think?

123
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,491
Toughness is a good thing.

124
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,909
Severity is reliable.

125
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,787
Even if it doesn't go off,
you can always take one in the head.

126
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,165
Boris the Razor,
or Boris the Dick.

127
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,669
Sharp as a sickle to the balls and hard as a hammer,
like a hammer blow. A living Soviet emblem.

128
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,674
They say this bastard is impossible to kill.

129
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:09,052
Back to my partner, Tommy.

130
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,054
Tommy is in our other business -

131
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,931
...slot machines.

132
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:16,685
We're living off it, and we were even able
to hire Gorgeous George.

133
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:20,982
However, at the moment.
Tommy is tight on defense.

134
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,067
All right, I'll take it.

135
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:27,988
Tommy's enthusiasm
for firearms has a reason.

136
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:32,368
Sooner or later in an underground fist fight.
you have to deal with this:

137
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,202
with Brick.

138
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:34,912
If this one isn't worth it,

139
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,039
to bet on him, then I don't even
I don't know who to bet on.

140
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,417
-He looks pretty good, doesn't he? -No.
-No, he looks great.

141
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,085
You'll be proud of him.

142
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:46,090
You think that's what people should be doing
to do for me? Make you proud of yourself?

143
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:47,674
You deserve it.

144
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:51,094
Get your tongue out of my ass, Gary.

145
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,055
That's usually how dogs lick.

146
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,098
You're not a dog, are you, Gary?

147
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,933
No. No, I'm not a dog.

148
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,186
Nevertheless...

149
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:02,939
for all intents and purposes, you're a real dog.

150
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,441
On everything but loyalty.

151
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:08,780
Rumor has it that Brick likes to get rid of people
of people with a stun gun,

152
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:13,201
a plastic bag, duct tape.
and a bunch of hungry pigs.

153
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:18,202
Liam, you're a completely ruthless cunt,
I'll tell you that.

154
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:24,124
But now is not the time to complain.

155
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:28,507
Errol, feed him to the pigs.

156
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:32,508
What the fuck are you two hatching?

157
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,934
If you want to do business with Brick,
the most important thing is to stay out of debt.

158
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,726
If you hit it, you're screwed.

159
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,229
That means you're in his pocket now.

160
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,230
And once you're in his pocket,
there's no going back.

161
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:49,569
I hear he's a good fighter.
That's why I'm using him.

162
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,030
I'm gonna do you a favor, boy.

163
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,575
What he's really saying is,
that I'm doing him a favor.

164
00:10:55,576 --> 00:11:00,623
Because everyone knows that in my fights.
nobody goes down. Unlike his fights.

165
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,792
Hey, Errol, I don't think he likes me.

166
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,544
You don't like me, do you?

167
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,128
I don't know what you're talking about.

168
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:11,007
But I'm well aware of the fact that I want to get out of here
to get out of here. Fuck, it stinks in here.

169
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,281
All my fights are fast and clear,
so we can get out of here before we get

170
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,845
as soon as it's reported to the authorities.

171
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:18,389
Play by the rules and everything will be just right.

172
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,100
By what other rules?

173
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:24,145
It's very hard to make a living in boxing,

174
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,981
...and so, from time to time.
to compromise my principles.

175
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:30,192
And in general, it's best to forget about principles altogether.

176
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,861
Are they Lancashire pigs?

177
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:33,946
Who the fuck is talking to you,
talking to you, boy?

178
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:37,947
Oh, yeah, Tommy. Brick loves Tommy.

179
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,661
Don't let me down.

180
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:44,662
You don't want to let me down,
do you, boy?

181
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,250
I'll meet you at the ring.

182
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:53,967
Boris, this Frankie is Four,
fuck him in the mouth, Fingers,

183
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:57,219
...carries a diamond the size of my fist.

184
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,057
I've already told you that the diamond is in a briefcase
in a briefcase strapped to his arm.

185
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:03,517
I sent him to you to buy weapons.

186
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,562
What else do you want me to do for you.
to kill him for you or something?

187
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,231
But you don't kill him yourself.

188
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:12,568
Americans can't know
that the Russians are involved.

189
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,447
Otherwise they'll come to me.

190
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:20,409
Boris, you're my brother,
so try to act smart like I do.

191
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,912
Find someone who can
to steal the fucking rock.

192
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:25,289
I don't want this to backfire on me.

193
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,376
And I don't want you to kill him, Boris.
It would raise suspicion.

194
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,419
So don't hire idiots on the case.

195
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,256
Before he leaves for New York,
he'll be in London for a couple days,

196
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:38,257
...so act fast. Okay?

197
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,223
And here's the other thing.

198
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,308
It might help you.

199
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,937
He likes to gamble.

200
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,730
86 carats?

201
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:53,442
Great cut, great shape.

202
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:55,236
It's an excellent stone.

203
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:56,487
You're a good guy, Frankie.

204
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:59,824
And you did a really good job.
So, when are you coming back?

205
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,202
I'm gonna have to move
a couple of smaller rocks,

206
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:04,870
to get a good price.
This one will take a couple days.

207
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:08,871
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Dougie the head?

208
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:12,878
And here's the other thing, Frankie.

209
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,879
-What?
-Stay away from the casino.

210
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,386
You did a great job, son.

211
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:23,806
-Don't screw this whole thing up. Okay?
-I hear you, Avi.

212
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:27,807
I'll see you later, Avi.

213
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,687
86 carats.

214
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,605
-Where?
-London.

215
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,399
-London?
-London.

216
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,277
-London?
-Yes. -London.

217
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,280
Well, that's where the fish and chips and tea are,

218
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:44,281
...bad food, bad weather,
Mary fucking Poppins. London.

219
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,703
No, it's not for me.

220
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:50,081
That's Doug the Head. Everyone knows Doug the Head.

221
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,792
If there are stones and those stones
are stolen, that's him.

222
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,419
Doug is pretending to be Jewish.

223
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,171
He wants to be a Jew.

224
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:58,673
He even tells his family
that they're Jews.

225
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:02,218
Only he's as much of a Jew
as I am a fucking hamadryl.

226
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,619
He thinks being Jewish
is good for business.

227
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,389
And in the diamond business.

228
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,017
...it really helps.
-Avi!

229
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,394
He's coming today. Take care of him.

230
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,230
Avi, you know I don't buy rhinestones.

231
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:17,108
He doesn't sell rhinestones. Make it smaller.

232
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,444
Who do you think I am? This is England.

233
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,571
We play by the rules here.

234
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:23,114
Listen to me.

235
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:26,660
If the stones are kosher, I'll buy them.

236
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:30,661
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have lunch. Uh, bye.

237
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,254
What are you standing here for?

238
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,840
It's a free country, isn't it?

239
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,510
Well, this is a private store, isn't it?

240
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,511
Get the fuck outta here.

241
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:59,234
Girls, I want to see you in my office.

242
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,236
I just got a call from Avi's cousin.

243
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:04,239
-You'll meet him soon enough.
-Yes, Dad. You told us.

244
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,784
-He's a serious man in New York.
-Yes, Dad. You told us.

245
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:10,495
Girls, I'd like to see you in my
office.

246
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:14,496
Yes, Dad. You told us.

247
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:21,881
Weight is about reliability.

248
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:25,882
For me, reliability is the most important thing.

249
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,144
I'll take it.

250
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,812
How much do you want for it?

251
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,648
Not at all.

252
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,068
Okay, then what do you want for it?

253
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,697
I want you to do something for me.

254
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:48,991
There's a fight in a couple days.

255
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,617
What's the fight?

256
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,829
Underground boxing.

257
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,830
I know a bookie
who will be taking bets.

258
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,087
If you bet for me,

259
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,881
...consider us even.

260
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:07,760
-Why can't you do it yourself?
-Well...

261
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,761
...there aren't many bookmakers around here
that take that kind of bet.

262
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:16,641
And I owe this one a lot.

263
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:21,815
Besides, I know something
that other people don't.

264
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,526
So?

265
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:28,527
What do you know?

266
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,744
It's a campground. Gypsy campground.

267
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:37,581
-Right on the money.
-What are we doing here?

268
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:41,126
-Buying a mobile home.
-Who are we buying from, the fucking gypsies?

269
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,296
Are you out of your mind? This is gonna end in shit.

270
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:45,339
You'll be fine.

271
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,424
You're such an asshole.

272
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:51,425
I fucking hate gypsies.

273
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,598
Nice car, mister.

274
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,350
Well, not as cool as your bike.
How's it going?

275
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:58,477
Who are you looking for?

276
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,562
Mr. O'Neill.

277
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,982
-Would you like me to bring him in?
-That'd be nice.

278
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:05,693
Get out of here.

279
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:09,238
-So you'll find him?
-Yeah.

280
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:12,574
-What are you waiting for? -What are you waiting for?
-Waiting for you to pay me five pounds.

281
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,451
Fuck you, I can find him myself.

282
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,996
-Two fifty.
-I can give you a pound.

283
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,789
You're a fucking asshole.

284
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,125
There's one problem with gypsies.

285
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,793
What are you doing? Back off, man.

286
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:25,129
It's impossible to understand what they're saying.

287
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,922
You Tommy? You here about the motor home?

288
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:29,425
-Mr. O'Neill.
-Fuck that. Call me Mickey.

289
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:31,260
They don't speak Irish,
and they don't speak English.

290
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,762
-How's it going?
-The weather's not bad.

291
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,181
He's just a gypsy.

292
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:38,392
Holy shit! Look how big he is!

293
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:40,144
How tall are you?

294
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:42,396
-Guys, how much is in him?
-Healthy, yeah.

295
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,983
Mom, come look at this big guy here.

296
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:50,447
I bet you're a little bit
of boxing, sir? You look like a boxer.

297
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,574
Come on, Micky.
Ask them if they want a drink.

298
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,159
Yeah, I'd kill someone for a drink.

299
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,412
You don't have to kill anyone here,
I'm telling you.

300
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,706
Get your hands off me, now.

301
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:02,499
How about a cuppa, big guy?

302
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't play dumb, Micky.
Offer the man a proper drink.

303
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:08,547
Ooh, dandy.

304
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:12,008
-Wouldn't the big guy come with us?
-He'll watch the car.

305
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,009
-Does he think we're thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

306
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,993
He just likes
looking after cars

307
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,974
Nice dogs.
You like dogs?

308
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,476
-Dogs?
-What?

309
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:24,020
-Yes, dogs.
-Dogs. Do you like dogs?

310
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,022
Ah, dogs.

311
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,982
Yeah, I like dogs.

312
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,983
-But I like motorhomes better.
-Welcome.

313
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:46,164
If anyone knows how to bargain, it's gypsies.

314
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,461
That's probably why
they talk like that--

315
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,797
...so it's impossible to understand.

316
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,509
But if Tommy can buy cheaper
than we bargained for,

317
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,136
there's ice cream waiting for him when he gets back.

318
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,138
Good doggy, from a good family.

319
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,350
He'll be a little homesick,
but then he'll get used to it.

320
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,228
See you, guys. See you, boss.

321
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,856
All right, Micky. I'll see you later.

322
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,067
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

323
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:15,068
They're not such bad guys.

324
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,039
Hey, you looked at it when you bought it.

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,418
And I helped you as much as I could.

326
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,461
See your car? Come on, go for a drive.

327
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:34,462
Get the fuck out of here while you can still walk.

328
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,552
No one's doing anything to you,

329
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,389
...until you get yourself in trouble.

330
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,600
All right, give us our money back
and take back your cabin.

331
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,854
What the fuck am I gonna do with this fucking cabin
if it doesn't have fucking wheels?

332
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,274
-What, you want to fight?
-Over my dead body.

333
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,859
Go away, go away!

334
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,860
I won't let you fight! You know what happens
what happens when you fight!

335
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,532
Get her out of here.

336
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:03,533
Fucking hell.

337
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,584
You want money? Well, then no fucking around.

338
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,585
You and me.

339
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,769
So this is the kind of fight it's going to be.

340
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,769
Better not get up.

341
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,525
You better not get up!

342
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,907
Lie the fuck down and stay down.

343
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,534
I promise you, you won't want to get up.

344
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,912
...You have a death blow, you fat faggot,
you know that?

345
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,913
Watch it, motherfucker.

346
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,132
All right, guys. Get me on my feet.

347
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,425
Get down,

348
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,426
...or you'll never get up again.

349
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,266
You're a badass.

350
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,352
Sick, I see. I'm leaving.

351
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,353
You're not going anywhere, fat ass.

352
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,234
You're gonna stay here until we're done.

353
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:55,063
Turns out this chatty,
tattooed gypsy--

354
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,108
...Roma underground boxing champion.

355
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,737
Which means it's harder
than a coffin nail.

356
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,574
But that's not what Tommy's thinking about right now.

357
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,577
Tommy knows that if in a few minutes
gorgeous George doesn't come to his senses,

358
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:11,538
...then he, Tommy, will be buried with him.

359
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,374
Why the gypsies need to explain to anyone,

360
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,752
...why and why did a stranger in their tabor
a stranger died?

361
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,297
It's easier to bury them both
and move on to another place.

362
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:24,051
They don't have social security numbers
they don't have, do they?

363
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,553
And now Tommy, nicknamed "Titty".

364
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,430
...praying...

365
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,015
And if he doesn't pray,

366
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:34,016
...then he should fucking do it.

367
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,629
Hey, Bad Boy.

368
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,673
Sol.

369
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,634
Take it easy. No, it's mossonite.

370
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,135
Mosso's what?

371
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,430
Mossonite, man-made diamond, Lincoln.

372
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,391
Toy.

373
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,267
Glass.

374
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,269
It's cheap.

375
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,438
And he's standing...

376
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,690
...he's not worth a fucking thing.

377
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,943
Bad boy, how many times do I have to tell you:
go gangbusters.

378
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,196
Save that game for me and Saul.

379
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,197
All right. Uh-huh.

380
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,536
What is it, Vince?

381
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,496
It's a dog, Saul.

382
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,915
Don't bring her here.

383
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,834
What's the problem? It's just a fucking dog.

384
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,627
-Where did you get it?
-From the gypsies.

385
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,171
Here you go.

386
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,049
They slipped it to me along with some left-handed gold.

387
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,928
You know gypsies, Saul. They're always
they're always throwing their dogs in the mix.

388
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,307
She better not bite.

389
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,767
Look, what are you doing?

390
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,768
I want the dog to get used to the store
to the store, why?

391
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,399
Get the dog!

392
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,359
Hey, come back!

393
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,570
It's okay, Boris.

394
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,571
-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.

395
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,452
What can I do for you, Boris?

396
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,245
I have a job for you.

397
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,873
I already have a job.

398
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,874
Fifty tons for half a day's work.

399
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,295
Go on.

400
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,296
I want you to put up one bookie.

401
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,014
From Russia with love, huh?

402
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,475
I have some pebbles for sale,

403
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,853
...have someone to drop them off to,

404
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,147
...but I came to you.

405
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,148
Easy, Frankie, my son.
In another man's monastery.

406
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,237
I'm not in a convent, Doug.

407
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,406
I'm in a hurry.

408
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,033
I've got to stop by the bookie's.

409
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,452
To the bookie?

410
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,081
-Who are you betting on?
-Harris Bomber. -Harris Bomber.

411
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:04,082
A fist fighter?

412
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,171
Maybe you know something
that I don't?

413
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,551
Look, there's probably a lot of things I know
that you don't even know about.

414
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:15,762
Tyrone's tough as nails,
aren't you, Tyrone?

415
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,222
That's exactly who I am.

416
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:21,223
Tyrone's going to drive.
He took an extreme driving course.

417
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:25,268
Yes, I did.

418
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:28,316
And I don't want that dog
drooling all over my seats.

419
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,068
What are your seats like?

420
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,654
Tyrone, buddy, it's a stolen car.

421
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,739
When I'm behind the wheel, it's my car.

422
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,078
So make sure the dog
doesn't drool on my seats. You got it?

423
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,497
I can't believe you found her.
Where was she?

424
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,457
Ran back to the gypsies.

425
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:47,460
You go. How did she find them?

426
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:51,214
I don't know. I'm not a dog, Saul.

427
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,591
Ask the dog.

428
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:57,387
Maybe it's fucking homing.
or something.

429
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,514
Watch your brakes.

430
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,391
Saul, I'm fucking imagining it,
you said he could drive.

431
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:05,392
Don't worry about me. You better worry
about my seats and my dog.

432
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:09,438
All right?

433
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,252
What?

434
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,150
I heard you say he's a great driver.

435
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,048
Well, what the fuck is he gonna do
can take us away from?

436
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,134
Don't worry about Tyrone.
When you need him, he knows what he's doing.

437
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:40,135
-Worry about the guns, huh? -Yeah.
-Yeah.

438
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,018
What's that?

439
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,812
It's a shotgun, Saul.

440
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:50,857
It's a fucking anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

441
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,858
-I want to cause a panic, okay?
-You're gonna cause a massacre, not a panic.

442
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,840
Doesn't look like a bookie's office.

443
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,971
Why are we standing here?
How about we stand over there?

444
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,889
It's too crowded.

445
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,308
Is it too tight?

446
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,686
You could land a fucking Boeing in there.

447
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,857
Leave him alone. That's just the way he is.
Right, Tyrone?

448
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:36,190
Yeah, that's the one.

449
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,205
He's such a fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what did you do?

450
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,499
Yeah, Tyrone, what did you do?

451
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,502
Look, you're yanking my chain,
so enjoy it.

452
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:56,171
It's okay. Don't pull away.

453
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:59,049
Otherwise people will see the damage.
Why did you do that?

454
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,301
I haven't seen her.

455
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:04,347
It's a four-ton truck, Tyrone.
It's not a fucking bag of peanuts.

456
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,639
She's standing at a stupid angle.

457
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,436
She's behind you, Tyrone.

458
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:13,522
Remember, if you're backing up,
everything comes at you from behind.

459
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:16,525
You better teach your dog.

460
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:20,446
-Get the dog away from him.
-Get the dog away from me.

461
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:24,447
Give me that squeaker.
Last time he chewed on it and didn't say a word.

462
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,831
Hey, don't swallow that.

463
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:34,832
He won't be able to swallow it.

464
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:39,337
Yes.

465
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,342
Why the fuck...

466
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,927
...you put up Luxury George.....

467
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,847
...for the fight...

468
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:49,350
...two days before the Bomber fight?

469
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:52,895
The enemy was half his size.
I didn't expect this to happen.

470
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:57,025
You put a man
in a banned boxing fight--

471
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,069
...what the fuck else did you expect?

472
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,571
Rubbing ointments and shiatsu massages?

473
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,282
What's your problem?
Who messed you up?

474
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,952
You fucking pissed me off, Tommy.

475
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:11,953
You.

476
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:13,749
But you're the one who said
that it was a good deal.

477
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,543
Yeah, but I don't see any connection.....

478
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:19,880
between losing 10 tons of money,
Luxury George's hospitalization...

479
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:21,757
...and a good deal.

480
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:23,884
What do we tell Brick now?

481
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:26,428
That the fight isn't going to happen?

482
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:27,888
We'll replace the fighter.

483
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,974
Is there any hope that Brick won't notice?

484
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,476
Who the fuck are we going to put in place?

485
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:35,104
John Pistol will do?

486
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,022
Or is Willie the Crazy Fist?

487
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,608
I see you're out of the loop, huh?

488
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:41,819
The crazy fist has gone crazy,

489
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,820
...and Pistol shot himself.

490
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:53,244
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:55,540
What?

492
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,210
Let's hire this fucking gypsy.

493
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:01,504
-How much will you pay us?
-10 tons.

494
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:05,505
Holy shit. It's not a lot of money, so we need to talk.

495
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,518
All right. Uh-huh.

496
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,271
I'm signing up for the motorhome.

497
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:19,480
For what?

498
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,898
To the motor home.

499
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,499
Understood, only for the best.

500
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,111
It's kind of like we
wanted to get a motor home.

501
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,405
Why don't you like this one?

502
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:31,406
It's not for me. It's for Ma.

503
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:32,619
For whom?

504
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,620
For his ma.

505
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:03,650
Brick holds and illegal bookmakers.

506
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:07,403
They take bets on anything
that's mixed with blood and gore.

507
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,530
And here I am replacing a fighter,

508
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:12,742
...and Brick is sure
to take advantage of the situation.

509
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:15,620
He's gonna pull down my pants,
put Vaseline on my ass,

510
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,164
...and take good aim
before he shoots.

511
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:20,583
And if I hadn't found a gypsy to replace him,

512
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:24,584
...he'd just rip me in half.

513
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:30,632
They're so adorable,
the paint on the walls is curdling.

514
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:41,017
Come on, get angry, you woolly-haired faggot!

515
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:43,648
As soon as he gets in the ring,
he shits his pants in fear.

516
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,193
You poke him with a stick.
he's a beast in front of your eyes.

517
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:50,321
You like dogfighting, Turkish?

518
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:54,322
We lost Gorgeous George.

519
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:58,955
Say that again.

520
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:01,791
We lost Gorgeous George.

521
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,960
Where did you say you lost him?

522
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:06,754
This isn't some fucking
bunch of car keys, is it?

523
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:09,632
And that's not why we lost him,
because he's fucking unconscious, huh?

524
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:10,842
We're not giving up the fight.

525
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:14,012
I bet your balls
you don't say no.

526
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:17,556
We're changing the fighter.

527
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:20,517
Oh, for fuck's sake, can your girl
can talk?

528
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,978
And who did you trade him for, sweetheart?

529
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,522
You don't know him, but he's cool.

530
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:26,815
Cool?

531
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:30,816
I don't care if he's
I-Mohammed-Better-than-Bruce-Lee,

532
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,446
...you can't change fighters.

533
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,865
-No. -The fight's still on. -No.

534
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,596
As soon as I announce a replacement,
all bets will be called off.

535
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:38,327
You can't change fighters at the last minute.

536
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:42,328
And that's why there's not gonna be a fight,
you understand that well, you fucking asshole?

537
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:44,541
You can take your own bets on this fight.

538
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:47,210
Put your goat on a leash, Turetsky,
before she gets whipped.

539
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:51,211
Or do you want to get fucked, sweetheart?

540
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:58,138
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth round.

541
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:02,139
Do you understand me well, Turkish?

542
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:05,270
I really didn't want to get into it.....

543
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:06,855
...in debt.

544
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:09,608
But now I'm in his pocket.

545
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:13,028
You're walking on fucking thin ice,
my pedigree-pal friends.

546
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:16,615
And when it cracks,
I'll be waiting for you underneath.

547
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:20,616
Now get the fuck outta here.

548
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,628
Doug, where's Frankie Four Fingers?

549
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:33,048
How would I know? I'm not his mom.
But I'll see him soon.

550
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,926
-When's soon?
-He said he needed cash.

551
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:39,927
Said he'd be back right after the fight.

552
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:47,229
After the fight?

553
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,359
What fight?
You mean after the boxing fight?

554
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:56,280
-Is betting allowed in there?
-It's a boxing match, Avi.

555
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:59,324
-Does he have the diplomat with him?
-Yes, he has the diplomat with him.

556
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:01,326
And this asshole's a betting man?

557
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:05,873
You're talking about Frankie,
who's always got a gambling problem.

558
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,000
Avi, I'm not a telepath.

559
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,377
I think you're just stupid,
I'll tell you that.

560
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:13,213
Do you have any idea
why they call him Frankie Four Fingers?

561
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:14,798
I have no idea.

562
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:18,218
He's called that because he makes
idiotic bets with dangerous people.

563
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:21,138
And when he loses,
they circumcise him.

564
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,307
Don't think it's on the dick.

565
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,017
I'm sure he can pay.

566
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:28,979
Not with my money.
Got your toothbrush? We're going to London.

567
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Did you hear that? I'm going to London!

568
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:40,028
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you bald faggot!

569
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:44,160
I really don't like
leaving my country,

570
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:48,248
...especially not on a warm, sandy beach.
not on a warm, sandy beach,

571
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,876
...where everybody wears straw hats...
and they bring you cocktails.

572
00:34:51,877 --> 00:34:53,878
We have sandy beaches here.

573
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,963
Who the fuck needs them, these beaches of yours?

574
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,964
I hope you can understand that concern,

575
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,092
that I feel
for my friend Frankie.

576
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:02,720
I'm gonna find him, and you're gonna help me find him.

577
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:06,721
And we're gonna start at the place
where the fist fight takes place.

578
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,185
Now how am I supposed to get this toy?

579
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,895
He'll probably cough it up.

580
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:12,480
Is he gonna be okay?

581
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:13,939
I hope not.

582
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,318
-Are we gonna rob a bookie?
-Yeah, you're the big one.

583
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,653
What are we waiting for?

584
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:22,615
We're waiting for a man who has
four fingers and a briefcase in his hand.

585
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:23,658
Why?

586
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:28,497
Because we agreed that the Russian
the Russian gets the diplomat, and we take the money.

587
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,498
What's in the briefcase?

588
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:34,711
Fucking hell, Tyrone,
concentrate on the steering wheel.

589
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,755
Oh, my God.

590
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:41,258
-It's a private party tonight, guys. -Yeah.
-We're well aware of that, son.

591
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:44,011
That's why we're here.

592
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,222
All right, then. Go through the back.

593
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:50,101
Back door? I thought it was the front.

594
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:53,938
-It's a private party tonight, guys. -We know.
-We know. That's why we're here.

595
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:55,356
Tickets.

596
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:57,984
Are we ever going to get in at all?

597
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:01,112
Avi, Avi, you have to understand.

598
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:04,156
It's not exactly Las Vegas,
and the fight isn't exactly legal.

599
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:07,285
I don't care about Vegas or the law.

600
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:09,328
I'm looking for Frankie.

601
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,124
I know, and he said he'd be here.

602
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,901
If this is the place to place your bets,
he'll be here.

603
00:36:14,902 --> 00:36:16,085
Let's cut the bullshit.

604
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,712
To get it right.

605
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:21,713
Don't worry, he'll lie down in the fourth.

606
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:26,637
Is that him?

607
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:29,056
I don't know. How many fingers does he have?

608
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:31,350
I'm sorry, please, I don't have binoculars today.

609
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:35,351
All right, without further ado.
Let the show begin.

610
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,288
Do you know who owns this office?

611
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,289
Even if you know that, it's no use to you.
it's no use to you, so get everything you've got in here.

612
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:02,547
Vince, what are you doing in there?

613
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:06,548
What do you think I'm doing? Solomon,

614
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:10,263
...I'm already in pain!

615
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:14,264
Lower the flap now.

616
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,062
What's up, Vince?

617
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:19,689
It would be a lot better if you would stop
calling me by my first name.

618
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,317
-Money in the bag.
-The bets are in.

619
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,987
I don't give a fuck about your bets.

620
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,405
I understand.

621
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:30,825
But everyone...

622
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:32,494
...Bets...

623
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,955
...done.

624
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:38,956
And if all the bets are in,
there can't be any money in the till.

625
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:42,170
I don't fucking believe it!

626
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:46,171
I'm not fucking convincing you. It's a fact.

627
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:49,803
What have you got?

628
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:53,431
Nothing, actually.

629
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:57,432
There is change and no bills.

630
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:01,398
Show me your hands.

631
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:05,399
Okay, you have five fingers.

632
00:38:05,987 --> 00:38:07,988
The coins are copper.

633
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,989
What the fuck do you mean, brass?

634
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:23,625
It won't open because
because it's a bulletproof door.

635
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:27,671
Hold this.

636
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:37,889
My leg.

637
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:42,019
What are you whining about?
I haven't touched you at all.

638
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:53,989
We're fucked.

639
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:02,789
What the fuck are you doing here?

640
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:09,504
Get us out of here.

641
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:16,637
Tyrone, what are you doing? Get us out of here!

642
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:26,937
Tyrone, who the fuck is this man?

643
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:32,985
It's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinnie.

644
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:36,325
In the red corner of the ring.

645
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:39,036
a young, promising boxer.

646
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:43,249
Micky, the short of it is, in the fourth round.
you go down. Is that understood?

647
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,876
You just make sure
that he doesn't kill me before he does.

648
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:49,546
Let's salute the bonehead....

649
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,966
...with a cannon blast--

650
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:55,967
...Micky!

651
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,393
In the other corner of the ring...

652
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:04,770
He just looks like a fat faggot.

653
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:07,898
He is a fat faggot,
only a very dangerous one.

654
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:12,696
Bomber Crazy Harris!

655
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,783
Try to look like a boxer.

656
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:20,494
And let's, uh.

657
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:24,495
...let's get started!

658
00:40:56,281 --> 00:41:00,075
Do you realize that I've been fucking
down forty tons?

659
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,493
What the fuck?

660
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:04,455
-I'll pay you back all the money.
-I don't like it.

661
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:08,083
I will return all the money, I answer. I answer.

662
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:12,084
That fucking gypsy, he's the one who set me up.

663
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:15,299
Thanks for the tip, Brick.

664
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,636
Listen, you pus-faced faggot,
if I throw a bone to a dog,

665
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,304
...I'm not interested in whether the dog likes it
or not.

666
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:25,268
You stop me again,
and I'll fuck your balls clean off.

667
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:51,164
-He's here.
-Come on, you explain it to him.

668
00:41:57,341 --> 00:42:00,301
-What are you doing?
-The diplomat was strapped to his arm.

669
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,929
And why didn't you cut it off?

670
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,431
We're not fucking butchers, Boris.

671
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:06,975
But the briefcase is strapped to his arm.....

672
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:10,687
Look, we're... Anyway, you have a problem.

673
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:14,065
There was no money in the office at all.

674
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,567
Id.

675
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,444
Here's ten tons for you.

676
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,739
No. Keep them. We want these.

677
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,784
Well, or at least half of it.

678
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:27,578
What was in the briefcase--
was agreed to belong to me.

679
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:31,165
What was in the office is yours.
Right?

680
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:35,166
There wasn't much money in it,
so here's 10 tons to help you out.

681
00:42:35,254 --> 00:42:37,213
I'm afraid it's too late.

682
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:41,009
We want half, and that's only because
because we're very generous.

683
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,014
Because if we wanted to,
we'd take the fucking rock for ourselves, Boris.

684
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:58,484
Careful.

685
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:02,485
Drop the gun, fatty.

686
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:08,116
Stupid motherfuckers.
He shouldn't have heard my name.

687
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:11,664
Give me the rock.

688
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:15,627
-He's in the briefcase.
-What?

689
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:16,794
It's in the briefcase.

690
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,839
Did you put the rock in the briefcase?

691
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,634
Open it and give me the stone.

692
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:26,635
The only person who knew
the lock code, you just shot him.

693
00:43:56,251 --> 00:44:00,250
Anyway, it wasn't smart to chill out
after Mickey's performance.

694
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:05,259
Brick was looking for us, looking for us to kill Tommy,
to kill Tommy, Mickey and me.

695
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:09,551
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

696
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:14,018
I'd be happy to get out of the country,
but that would take money.

697
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,310
But all my money is in the safe,
and the safe is in the office.

698
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,357
Once I get them, then, uh.

699
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,109
Oink, oink, oink.

700
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,570
Shit.

701
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:29,199
So this is where you keep your money.

702
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,533
What do you two want here?

703
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,870
You're jumping out of your pants
just to sniff something out.

704
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,872
That sounds hostile to me, John.

705
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,126
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

706
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:43,127
No, John, I don't.

707
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,390
I just shined my shoes.

708
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:04,189
Come on, put the kettle on.

709
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:09,612
-Will you have sugar?
-No, Turkish, thanks.

710
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:13,866
I'm sweet enough as it is.

711
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,962
He's your problem now.

712
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:27,963
Okay?

713
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:37,185
10 tons you can keep--
along with the corpse.

714
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:41,477
But if I see one of you faggots.

715
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,900
Look at him.

716
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:55,911
I have a fist fight in a couple days.

717
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:58,664
And I need a gypsy.

718
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,290
Uh, okay. Uh, sure.

719
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,793
Sure? Dickish.

720
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:06,296
I didn't ask you, I told you.

721
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,215
And this time.

722
00:46:08,216 --> 00:46:12,216
...I really want him to lay down in the fourth.

723
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:16,975
This time, seriously.

724
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:31,567
I know you came here
to open your safe.

725
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:35,574
You can open it.

726
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:38,160
Turkish is a tricky bastard.

727
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:40,204
I thought he was gone with the money.

728
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:44,205
Don't think too much, Errol - there'll be trouble.

729
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,627
Okay, one little piggy has been taken care of.

730
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:49,755
Now find me the dumbasses
who attacked the bookie.

731
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:53,756
Find them today.

732
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:13,279
Good morning to you, Mrs. O'Neill.

733
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,656
Tommy.

734
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:19,160
You're as sly as a snake.
Where'd you get the flowers?

735
00:47:19,161 --> 00:47:21,662
You're looking for my boy, aren't you?

736
00:47:21,663 --> 00:47:25,374
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yes.

737
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,585
Can you tell me where?

738
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:31,255
I don't want you dragging my son
into any kind of trouble.

739
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:35,256
He's my only son.
And he's a good boy.

740
00:47:36,178 --> 00:47:39,764
He hunts.

741
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,849
Hunting? Hunting who?

742
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,643
Hunts hares.

743
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:47,644
They exhibit two dogs - hounds.

744
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,691
On a hare.

745
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:53,986
And the hare has to get away from the dogs.

746
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:57,365
What if he doesn't?

747
00:47:57,366 --> 00:48:01,366
Well, then the hare is fucked.

748
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,749
Real fucked up?

749
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,501
Yeah, Tommy.

750
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:12,502
Even though the Nazis
had not yet landed.

751
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,383
You know these assholes, Errol?

752
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:16,842
I know a lot of assholes.

753
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:19,845
But I've never seen anyone as fucking stupid as these two,
I've never seen before.

754
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:22,139
John?

755
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,140
No, I don't know.

756
00:48:28,397 --> 00:48:29,939
Tyrone.

757
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,940
Fat, stupid bastard.

758
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,320
-So what?
-It depends.

759
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:37,530
From what?

760
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:40,658
From whether you buy a motorhome or not.

761
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:43,576
Not the red one. We should go with pink.

762
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:46,037
-But that's a whole other cabin.
-And this is a different fight.

763
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,248
This cabin is twice the size of the previous one.

764
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:50,389
Turkish, you'll get twice as much
you'll get twice as much for this fight.

765
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,459
And my mom needs a house.

766
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,671
I like looking after her.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

767
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:58,672
Micky, you're lucky you're still alive after
after your performance, we're still alive.

768
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:03,051
What the fuck would it take
buying a palace on wheels?

769
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:08,393
I'm not saying your mom doesn't deserve him,
I'm just saying.

770
00:49:08,394 --> 00:49:12,394
Okay, all right [speaks very slurred].

771
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:22,700
Okay.
And this one - she really likes the color blue.

772
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:28,496
Did I make myself clear?

773
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:31,207
Yeah, very accessible, Micky.

774
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:35,208
Give me a moment to consult
with my colleague.

775
00:49:39,091 --> 00:49:43,091
Do you understand a word I'm saying?

776
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:47,140
I'll tell you what.

777
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:48,850
Fuck you.

778
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:50,935
Let's get hammered.

779
00:49:50,936 --> 00:49:52,187
What?

780
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:54,022
He wants to bet on a hare.

781
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:57,233
What, like Tommy last time?
Look, do me a favor.

782
00:49:57,234 --> 00:49:58,944
I'm doing you a favor.

783
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:01,863
Here's the deal.
If I win, I get the cabin.

784
00:50:01,864 --> 00:50:05,864
And all the guys got a pair of these shoes,
like yours.

785
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:10,038
If I lose.

786
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:14,039
...so fuck it, then,
I'll fight for free.

787
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:18,088
If there's one thing I didn't want to do,
it was arguing with a gypsy.

788
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:20,882
But I had no other choice.

789
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:24,344
I had to do something to get him
to get him to come forward. But if I lose.

790
00:50:24,345 --> 00:50:28,056
...I don't even want to think about losing.

791
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:31,935
All right. My money's on the hare being fucked.

792
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:35,936
What the fuck? Complete?

793
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,108
You got it, London.

794
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,109
Here we go!

795
00:51:51,348 --> 00:51:54,850
I'll fucking tell you everything! Get them off me!

796
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:58,851
I'll tell you who robbed the bookie!

797
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,620
The color blue. Bye, guys.

798
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:22,291
So who's totally fucked now?

799
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:24,797
Something's not right here.

800
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:28,798
I mean, we're the ones who were gonna buy the cabin from him.

801
00:52:28,843 --> 00:52:33,348
So why didn't you shoot him, huh, Tommy?

802
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:37,351
Although if you'd thrown a gun at him,
it would have made more sense.

803
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:40,104
What? What, are you trying to tell me
I can't shoot?

804
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:43,941
No, Tommy. I didn't say
you can't shoot.

805
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:46,026
I know you can't shoot.

806
00:52:46,027 --> 00:52:50,282
What I'm trying to say is that that piece of shit
piece of shit you're wearing in your pants,

807
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:52,783
...it's no use.

808
00:52:52,784 --> 00:52:54,576
Are you saying it's not working?

809
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:58,577
Did you fire it?

810
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:04,670
Oops.

811
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:08,173
I'd like to meet this
fucking tricky-ass Russian.

812
00:53:08,174 --> 00:53:10,926
Why does he have a teapot warmer on his head?

813
00:53:10,927 --> 00:53:13,053
To keep your head warm.

814
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:15,764
-What happened to him?
-He was shot in the face, Lincoln.

815
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:17,433
I thought it was obvious.

816
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:20,019
What are you putting that on him for?
Did you mistake it for a teapot?

817
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,730
-What do you want from me?
-Guess.

818
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:25,815
-I'm not a sorcerer, I don't bring the dead back to life.
-But you're so bad,

819
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:28,901
...and the bad guys know
how to dispose of bodies.

820
00:53:28,902 --> 00:53:32,902
I only make corpses.
I don't know how to dispose of corpses.

821
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:41,789
Done, sir.

822
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,916
Oh, that's great.

823
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:47,917
Errol, make me a cup of tea.

824
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:49,339
Hold his legs.

825
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,340
What the fuck else am I supposed to hold him by.
by his fucking ears?

826
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:06,686
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

827
00:54:10,235 --> 00:54:14,030
Do you know who I am?

828
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:18,031
I know.

829
00:54:22,456 --> 00:54:26,456
Good. That'll save time.

830
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:31,211
Well, I don't know.

831
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,891
If you carry a corpse in one piece,
you're always gonna have a problem.

832
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,643
The best thing you can do with him

833
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:48,232
...is to cut it into six pieces
and stack them up.

834
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:52,026
Will someone tell me who you are?

835
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:55,196
And when you've broken it down into six pieces,
that's when you can get rid of him.

836
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:59,197
Just don't hide the pieces in the fridge,
so you don't scare your mom.

837
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:08,498
In fact, I've heard that the best way
is to feed the corpse to the pigs.

838
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:11,963
Hogs need to go without food for a few days,

839
00:55:11,964 --> 00:55:15,964
...and after that, they're gonna eat
the dismembered corpse for all it's worth.

840
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,471
But in order for the meat to digest well,

841
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:22,557
you have to shave the corpse's head first.
and pull out all the teeth.

842
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:24,809
Of course, that can be taken care of later,

843
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,271
...but who wants to pick out
the victim's teeth out of pig shit?

844
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:32,272
And they'll eat the bones no problem.

845
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,610
It takes at least 16 pigs at a time
it takes at least 16 pigs to get rid of one corpse at a time,

846
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:40,697
...so beware
of hog farms.

847
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:44,411
A 200-pound body will be eaten by pigs....

848
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:46,538
...in about 8 minutes.

849
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:48,415
That means that one pig....

850
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:52,377
...eats two pounds of raw meat.....

851
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:54,963
...per minute.

852
00:55:54,964 --> 00:55:57,174
This is where the proverb comes from...

853
00:55:57,175 --> 00:56:01,175
... "greedy as a pig."

854
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:08,561
Well, thanks for the tip.
It's all clear what's what.

855
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:12,272
Now, if you don't mind explaining,
who the fuck you are and what you are.

856
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:16,273
I don't have to tell you about feeding human meat to pigs,
I don't need to tell you anymore.

857
00:56:19,405 --> 00:56:23,405
Do you know what the word retribution means?

858
00:56:25,703 --> 00:56:29,456
Retribution is an act of avenging, it is vengeance,

859
00:56:29,457 --> 00:56:33,457
...carried out by any means necessary.

860
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:38,675
In this particular case.
it's going to be done by a fucking asshole.

861
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:43,217
Я.

862
00:56:48,476 --> 00:56:52,476
Gentlemen.

863
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:23,635
Why can't you find me Frankie, Doug?

864
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:28,057
Avi, what do you want from me?
I'm not a detective.

865
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:31,268
What about Tony?

866
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:32,728
Tony - A bullet in your teeth?

867
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:33,812
What's a Bullet in your teeth?

868
00:57:33,813 --> 00:57:36,064
-Tony!
-You fucker.

869
00:57:36,065 --> 00:57:37,357
He's reliable.

870
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:39,776
He'll get anyone from under the ground.

871
00:57:39,777 --> 00:57:41,445
You're gonna die, Tony!

872
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:45,446
He was hit six times in a row, but they couldn't kill him.
but couldn't kill him. He took the bullets out and melted them down.

873
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,576
I shot you, fall down!

874
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:51,413
His father made his teeth out of two bullets,
so he loves his father.

875
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:53,540
Why don't you fucking die?

876
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:57,541
-He's the best one to find Frankie. -Six times.
-Six times?

877
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:59,921
At a time.

878
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:03,300
Well, you're in trouble now.

879
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:07,300
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

880
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:22,148
Bonjour.

881
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:25,237
Well, what was it you wanted to tell me
so fucking important?

882
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:27,657
Mister, how do you think
why we have a dead body in our office

883
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:30,701
-with a briefcase strapped to your arm?
-Well, tell me soon.

884
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:32,787
Give us four days,

885
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:36,666
...and I'll bring you a fucking diamond,
the size of a house. I'm not kidding.

886
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,167
What do you think of that, Errol?

887
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:41,587
I think it's imperative that we drain the blood
to drain the blood while the time is right.

888
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:44,090
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

889
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:47,301
Do you remember what I told you about, uh,
what you think?

890
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:49,720
-Give you 48 hours.
-Yes.

891
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,721
You can keep that fat faggot
you can keep it to yourself.

892
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:54,767
Anyway, the guys
can't get him off the floor.

893
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,477
After all, it's your family, fatty.

894
00:58:56,478 --> 00:59:00,478
And if anything, the pigs will finish what the dogs can't,
what the dogs can't eat.

895
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:05,612
What should I call you? Bullet or Tooth?

896
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:07,780
Call me Suzanne if you like.

897
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:11,450
Tony, there's someone I need to find.

898
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:15,371
It depends on
how many elements are in the equation. How many are there?

899
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:19,292
40,000.

900
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:21,877
Where was he last seen?

901
00:59:21,878 --> 00:59:23,337
Bookie's.

902
00:59:23,338 --> 00:59:26,966
At the bookie's?

903
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:30,967
Give me the pipe, Susie.

904
00:59:32,889 --> 00:59:36,225
-The bookie was put up last night. -Yes.
-They did? Tony, make yourself clear.

905
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:38,561
I thought you guys invented the fucking English language.
was invented here,

906
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:41,230
and you make it sound like
you can't understand a damn thing.

907
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:42,815
Kicked out, I mean robbed.

908
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:45,401
We're gonna meet someone
who might know something about this.

909
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:47,445
I need a gun.

910
00:59:47,446 --> 00:59:51,446
You don't need no gun.
You need me.

911
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:55,661
So I fucked him up with black ink.
from head to toe.

912
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:57,997
Now he's gonna be dead before he dies.

913
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:00,916
And I took the gold, of course.
Fucking great.

914
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:04,917
Hey, Hammer.

915
01:00:07,215 --> 01:00:09,800
Hey, Tony, how you doing?
You all right, buddy?

916
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,385
Nice tie.

917
01:00:11,386 --> 01:00:13,262
I heard you retired.

918
01:00:13,263 --> 01:00:17,224
No, the blood in my veins hasn't turned sour yet.

919
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:19,685
That's unlike you, Hammer.

920
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:21,562
Who put up the bookie Brick?

921
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:25,024
-Do me a favor, Tony.
-I'll do you a favor, Hammer.

922
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:29,024
I'm not gonna fuck you up
in front of your girls.

923
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:33,695
What good is that gonna do, buddy?
Jesus, I don't know anything.

924
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:39,496
Are you comfortable, Hammer?

925
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:42,666
What a sad irony:
your fancy tie will ruin you.

926
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:45,919
Well, now you can think about my question
on my question.

927
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,004
What the fuck are you doing, Tony?

928
01:00:48,005 --> 01:00:51,424
Driving down the street with the glass over your head.

929
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:55,425
-What do you think I'm doing?
-Don't, Tony.

930
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:58,181
Hey, are you brushing your teeth with dog shit
instead of toothpaste?

931
01:00:58,182 --> 01:00:59,724
Pull over, Tony.

932
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:02,018
Pull over, Tony!

933
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:06,019
I'm not gonna slow down.
I think I'm going to step on the gas.

934
01:01:06,065 --> 01:01:10,065
Here, listen to the music.

935
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:12,654
I love this song.

936
01:01:12,655 --> 01:01:15,824
Okay, I want to know who put out
Brick's bookmaking firm.

937
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:17,284
What, Hammer?

938
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:22,623
I think it was two black men,
who work at a pawn shop on Smith Street.

939
01:01:22,915 --> 01:01:24,916
Did you think it through?

940
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:30,256
I'm telling you, it was two black men,
who work at the pawn shop on Smith Street.

941
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:33,216
Very effective, Tony.

942
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:36,886
Yes, it's not very gentle,
but very effective.

943
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:40,887
Are we taking him with us?

944
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:49,816
It's Russian.

945
01:01:49,817 --> 01:01:51,067
Russian?

946
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:53,987
To be precise, he's an Uzbekistani.

947
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:58,451
Uzbek? I've dealt with those
sneaky-ass Russian dogs.

948
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,286
-First name.
-Yurinov.

949
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:03,163
Boris.

950
01:02:03,164 --> 01:02:04,998
-Boris Razor?
-Yes.

951
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:08,999
Is that the Boris who's Boris the Dickens?

952
01:02:09,378 --> 01:02:12,756
And why is his name Dick Dick?

953
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:16,757
Because you can't hit it, Avi.

954
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:20,221
He's not gonna fight
unless we buy his mom a motor home,

955
01:02:20,222 --> 01:02:22,182
...and you took all our money.

956
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:26,354
Mother of God, can you say that again?

957
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:31,313
He's a stubborn bastard.
He says he has to take care of his mom.

958
01:02:31,442 --> 01:02:34,027
-And then what?
-What can I do?

959
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:36,446
I can't make him fight.

960
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:40,447
Yes, Turkish,
you're not much use to me alive.

961
01:02:44,664 --> 01:02:48,663
Useless asshole.
Punish that gypsy, Errol.

962
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,960
I want Gypsy to fight.

963
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:20,197
Brick decided that
if we smashed our slot machines,

964
01:03:20,198 --> 01:03:24,198
it'll help me convince Mickey.

965
01:03:24,411 --> 01:03:26,787
And as if that wasn't enough,

966
01:03:26,788 --> 01:03:29,707
...He decided it would also be a good idea to ....

967
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:33,708
burn down Mickey's mom's cabin.

968
01:03:33,795 --> 01:03:37,795
Burn it when she slept in it.

969
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:35,272
Turkish, come here.

970
01:04:35,273 --> 01:04:36,857
You'll follow us--

971
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:40,402
...shoot the fuck out of you.

972
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:43,572
Calm down, son. Take it easy.

973
01:04:43,573 --> 01:04:47,573
I got a gun, son.
So don't you mess around.

974
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,912
What?

975
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:53,913
You want to make sure my hand doesn't waver?

976
01:05:11,058 --> 01:05:12,642
Oh, my God.

977
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:15,478
I'm sorry, Mickey.

978
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:19,479
Did you do it?

979
01:05:21,944 --> 01:05:24,654
What are you sorry for then?

980
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:27,365
-You two, what are you doing here? -What are you doing here?
-Back.

981
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:31,160
-I'm going to give you a good one.
-Fuck off, Darren.

982
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:35,161
Get the fuck outta here!

983
01:05:39,712 --> 01:05:42,171
What a fool I feel.

984
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,049
His mother is fuming beside us,

985
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:48,469
...and I ask him to fight in the ring.

986
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,723
All right, I'm gonna fight
before he kills anyone else.

987
01:05:51,724 --> 01:05:53,808
If he had said no,

988
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:57,809
things would have been a lot worse.

989
01:06:02,151 --> 01:06:06,151
Russians.

990
01:06:09,158 --> 01:06:10,825
Russians.

991
01:06:10,826 --> 01:06:12,493
I should have known.

992
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:16,494
Cossack whores, you damn anti-Semites.

993
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:19,334
What do you know about this goy?

994
01:06:19,335 --> 01:06:21,669
Former KGB officer.

995
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,130
He's had special training as an undercover agent.

996
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:27,425
He'll be impossible to find.

997
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:28,676
Yes.

998
01:06:28,677 --> 01:06:32,555
There's a strange man here
wants to sell us an 84-carat diamond.

999
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:35,350
-Where did he come from?
-I don't know. It's hard to say.

1000
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:39,351
He has a heavy Russian accent.

1001
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:53,577
What was I supposed to do?
He was poisoning me with dogs. Here, look.

1002
01:06:54,328 --> 01:06:58,081
Sneaky fucking Russian! No wonder
he didn't want to do it himself.

1003
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:01,084
All right, let's take it from the top.
One of us, uh.

1004
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:05,923
Tyrone, that's you, is going to the Russian.
As soon as you see him, call us.

1005
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:10,507
Let's go.

1006
01:07:13,472 --> 01:07:17,016
Look, you got to be careful with him,
with this guy.

1007
01:07:17,017 --> 01:07:21,017
I hate Russians. I'll deal with him.

1008
01:07:23,023 --> 01:07:26,693
No problem.

1009
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:28,610
Call a doctor.

1010
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,697
Shoot the fuck out of him!
And then call me a doctor.

1011
01:07:31,698 --> 01:07:33,824
Okay, but first we get the stone.

1012
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:36,201
First the rock. Then the doctor.

1013
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:39,329
And not just any doctor, boy.
A good Jewish doctor.

1014
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:43,330
Find my friend a good Jewish doctor!

1015
01:07:45,545 --> 01:07:48,463
Take the keys from him and find the stone.

1016
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,802
-I think you have something you want to tell us. -What?
-Calm down, honey.

1017
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:55,595
Do you guys want him
so he can talk or what?

1018
01:07:55,596 --> 01:07:58,223
What the fuck is a fake, huh?

1019
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:02,060
They're not combat-ready, but they look like the real thing,
and no one's gonna argue.

1020
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:05,814
And the bullets may be blanks,
but they're extra loud, just in case.

1021
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:09,815
Just in case we decide
to stun him to death or something?

1022
01:08:14,073 --> 01:08:16,617
-Yes.
-Boris is here.

1023
01:08:16,618 --> 01:08:19,953
-We're on our way. Don't let him out.
-Hey, wait.

1024
01:08:19,954 --> 01:08:23,954
He's not alone.

1025
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:31,295
Let's go.

1026
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:37,134
You're a fucking Cossack.

1027
01:08:44,103 --> 01:08:48,103
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1028
01:08:50,401 --> 01:08:51,652
So, where is he?

1029
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:54,529
He's not alone anymore. Three men came into the house.

1030
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,530
-And they locked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us about this?

1031
01:08:59,243 --> 01:09:00,577
How do they - do they look cool?

1032
01:09:00,578 --> 01:09:01,995
They look beat up.

1033
01:09:01,996 --> 01:09:05,123
-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?

1034
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:07,501
I want you to bury him.

1035
01:09:07,502 --> 01:09:10,212
All right. (chuckles)

1036
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:12,714
I think we should get you a new gun.

1037
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,883
But for now, try this one.

1038
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,052
How much further to the Russian?

1039
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:21,053
One minute left.

1040
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:27,271
-Well, come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Winnie.

1041
01:09:27,272 --> 01:09:31,272
We can't take them now.
We have to follow them.

1042
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:34,611
You shouldn't drink that stuff.

1043
01:09:34,612 --> 01:09:36,405
Why is that? What's wrong?

1044
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:39,574
-She's out of sync with evolution. -She's out of sync with evolution.
-Shut up.

1045
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,201
How do we get rid of him?

1046
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:43,870
-Want to shoot me?
-It's too noisy.

1047
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:46,999
-Would you like to stab me?
-That's too cruel.

1048
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,793
-So do you want to kill him or what? -You want to kill him or what?
-I'll cut him up. I have a knife.

1049
01:09:50,794 --> 01:09:52,420
That's what I like.

1050
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,171
Do they even shoot?

1051
01:09:54,172 --> 01:09:55,589
Of course they do.

1052
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,967
How do you know? They're fakes.

1053
01:09:57,968 --> 01:10:01,968
What do you know about dummies?

1054
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:06,517
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1055
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:08,936
You wanted to know if they were shooting or not.

1056
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:13,692
I didn't say try it in the car,
Saul, you asshole!

1057
01:10:14,026 --> 01:10:16,777
And what are you gonna do with it.
pick his teeth?

1058
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:19,391
Wipe the butter off of it
and put it back in the table.

1059
01:10:19,392 --> 01:10:20,698
It's a normal tool down there.

1060
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:24,327
Cows were domesticated about 8,000 years ago.

1061
01:10:24,328 --> 01:10:27,038
Before that, they were like trucks--
running around.

1062
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,043
The human digestive system
is not adapted to dairy products.

1063
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:34,462
Fuck you, Tommy. Where'd you read that?

1064
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,463
Let me help you.

1065
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:42,762
Oops.

1066
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:44,430
You. Do you need a knife?

1067
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:46,807
No, I don't. I don't know what to do with him.

1068
01:10:46,808 --> 01:10:49,226
It's a knife, for Christ's sake.

1069
01:10:49,227 --> 01:10:51,812
What have you been doing at the same time
with a fork all these years?

1070
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:55,813
Sharp side, dumb side.
What, you need a lesson?

1071
01:11:17,464 --> 01:11:21,464
Isn't that Boris, by any chance?

1072
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:40,441
Tyrone, what have you done?

1073
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,154
What are we gonna do about Bouton?

1074
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:46,155
You can take it with you if you want.

1075
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:50,368
Just tell me which part
is your favorite part?

1076
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,500
They're coming out.

1077
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,919
Lie down and watch them.

1078
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,130
Cover yourself, Avi.

1079
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,756
Just don't make a scene.

1080
01:12:00,757 --> 01:12:03,968
What scenes, Tony.

1081
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:07,096
Shit, you don't have to bring the dog
with you, Vince.

1082
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:11,096
I can't just leave her here, can I?

1083
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:19,190
Pint of black, Warden.

1084
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:23,191
I thought you wanted to wash up. The restroom's back there.

1085
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:27,365
-He left the door open.
-I don't think that's a good idea.

1086
01:12:27,366 --> 01:12:28,992
Shall we go in?

1087
01:12:28,993 --> 01:12:32,746
I don't want to go in there.
It's a very dangerous animal.

1088
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:36,747
They say Russians are very dangerous.

1089
01:12:37,043 --> 01:12:40,795
This one's a freak from every angle.

1090
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:43,882
I don't give a fuck what he is.

1091
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:47,883
All I need is a proper barrel,
and all my questions will be answered at once.

1092
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:52,140
Jesus, Tommy,
you really do have a steady hand.

1093
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:56,061
Well, hurry up, then,
before the Nazis land.

1094
01:12:56,062 --> 01:13:00,062
Just show him who's boss.

1095
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:08,278
Boris...

1096
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:14,868
That's quite a show.

1097
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:23,129
Drowning Trout Pub.

1098
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,798
Stop by and pick us up.

1099
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:27,008
And Doug...

1100
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:31,009
... make it quick.

1101
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:51,950
I don't want to make a fuss, and I'm not gonna
put a bullet in your head,

1102
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:54,351
...but if you don't give me what I need
what I want,

1103
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:58,352
there's gonna be a fucking murder here.

1104
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:00,375
What's your name?

1105
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:04,376
Shoot him.

1106
01:14:08,509 --> 01:14:12,509
Let go of the gun!

1107
01:14:18,102 --> 01:14:22,102
Okay, so you're the local dick,

1108
01:14:22,315 --> 01:14:26,192
...and these on the sides are your balls.

1109
01:14:26,193 --> 01:14:28,987
There are two types of eggs:

1110
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:32,987
...big, brave balls,
and little faggot balls.

1111
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:36,243
Those are your last words, you better pray.

1112
01:14:36,244 --> 01:14:39,705
Obviously, every dick is always standing
looking out,

1113
01:14:39,706 --> 01:14:41,749
...only he's got no brains.

1114
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,750
And as soon as he smells pussy,
he comes alive.

1115
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:49,340
And now you've decided it smells like
of good old-fashioned pussy

1116
01:14:49,341 --> 01:14:52,801
and you brought with you
your faggot balls,

1117
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:56,802
...to have fun.
But you're a little confused.

1118
01:14:57,974 --> 01:15:00,559
There's no pussy in here.

1119
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,560
Now you're gonna wish you were
you weren't born a woman.

1120
01:15:04,731 --> 01:15:07,441
Like a brainless dick should,

1121
01:15:07,442 --> 01:15:10,027
...You don't understand the situation.....

1122
01:15:10,028 --> 01:15:12,738
...now you're starting to shrivel up.

1123
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:16,575
And your little balls
are shriveling up with you.

1124
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:20,576
That's because the side
on the side of your gun says "fake."

1125
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:29,631
... and the .50-caliber Desert Eagle ...

1126
01:15:32,384 --> 01:15:36,384
... written on the side of my, uh.

1127
01:15:38,974 --> 01:15:42,017
There's nothing for you to catch here.

1128
01:15:42,018 --> 01:15:46,018
...along with your balls.

1129
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:51,986
And now.

1130
01:15:51,987 --> 01:15:55,987
...get the fuck outta here.

1131
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:10,587
Close the door.

1132
01:16:10,588 --> 01:16:14,588
Lock it up!

1133
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:19,847
Give me the briefcase.

1134
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:22,391
Fuck you!

1135
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:23,767
Shoot me.

1136
01:16:23,768 --> 01:16:27,768
Of course you are. I'll shoot you.

1137
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:39,908
Give me the briefcase or I'll shoot you.

1138
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:41,702
You know what?

1139
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:43,245
Fuck you, too.

1140
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:46,874
Go ahead, shoot me.
Do me a favor, Russian faggot.

1141
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:50,294
You! Drop your weapons.

1142
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:51,587
Fuck you!

1143
01:16:51,588 --> 01:16:54,714
You, drop the gun!

1144
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,924
All right. (chuckles)

1145
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:58,343
Avi...

1146
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:02,344
...get down!

1147
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:16,566
-Tyrone?
-Fuck him, let's get the fuck out of here.

1148
01:17:17,363 --> 01:17:21,363
Give me the briefcase.

1149
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:33,795
Avi...

1150
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:37,590
-Where's the briefcase?
-Put the gun away

1151
01:17:37,591 --> 01:17:41,591
What's Boris doing here?

1152
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,680
Fuck you!

1153
01:17:53,232 --> 01:17:56,109
Where's the diplomat?

1154
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,945
-You piece of shit Boris,
I thought I told you to shut up.

1155
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:02,946
I'll show you.

1156
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,660
I'll show you.

1157
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:12,583
No hit.

1158
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:16,584
Fucking hell.

1159
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:22,218
Fuck you all.

1160
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:26,219
Lucky bastard.

1161
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:33,855
Look how flawless it is.

1162
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:36,983
Don't get used to it. You should give it to Brick.

1163
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:38,526
Leave the dog here.

1164
01:18:38,527 --> 01:18:43,115
-Saul, why can't we just leave? -Because life is short, Vincent.
-Because life is short, Vincent.

1165
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:46,534
And if Brick wants it, it'll get even shorter.

1166
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:50,163
-So, leave the dog here. -Yes.
-Yes, I'm leaving it here. -Yes.

1167
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:51,205
Don't worry.

1168
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:55,206
If that gypsy asshole here
messes anything up, you'll be held accountable.

1169
01:18:56,795 --> 01:18:58,671
It's okay.

1170
01:18:58,672 --> 01:19:02,672
Sit. Sit.

1171
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:08,640
I don't want to go in there.
I'm never coming out of there.

1172
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:11,643
You're not getting out of here
if you don't go now.

1173
01:19:11,644 --> 01:19:14,019
Okay, give me the rock...

1174
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:18,020
...and I'll give it to Brick.
How's that?

1175
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:22,195
All right. Uh-huh. Wait a minute.
I can't get it.

1176
01:19:26,074 --> 01:19:28,325
Why did you put it in there?

1177
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:31,536
Well, I hid this in case we got robbed,
in case we got mugged.

1178
01:19:31,537 --> 01:19:33,789
Are you out of your mind or something?

1179
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:37,790
Who's gonna rob two black men
who are sitting in a car with guns,

1180
01:19:37,794 --> 01:19:41,794
...that costs less than your shirt?

1181
01:19:44,175 --> 01:19:48,175
Tony the Bullet in the Teeth and his friend,
a .50-caliber Desert Eagle.

1182
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,139
What do they care?

1183
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:55,140
They both look right at me.

1184
01:19:56,437 --> 01:20:00,650
Never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1185
01:20:01,067 --> 01:20:02,651
We got out of the car.

1186
01:20:02,652 --> 01:20:05,612
You can keep your water pistols.

1187
01:20:05,613 --> 01:20:09,574
Look, tell him the rock
is in the office.

1188
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:13,575
I'll figure something out.

1189
01:20:15,873 --> 01:20:19,209
What's he so afraid of, Luxury?

1190
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,544
Don't mind me.

1191
01:20:20,545 --> 01:20:23,297
Tommy, why are you sweating?

1192
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:27,468
-Well, actually, I'm a little concerned. -Well, I'm a little concerned.
-Concerned about what?

1193
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:32,222
What happens if the gypsy knocks this one out too?

1194
01:20:32,223 --> 01:20:34,391
I mean, it's happened before, you know?

1195
01:20:34,392 --> 01:20:38,392
We're going to be killed before we can get
out of the building and then fed to the pigs.

1196
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:43,355
It makes me feel good to see you fucked up
and jumping up and down on the walls.

1197
01:20:44,986 --> 01:20:48,990
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't trust the gypsy.

1198
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:51,742
Don't think I haven't thought about it.

1199
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:55,743
He's burying his mother tonight,
God rest her soul.

1200
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:01,293
You know how gypsies drink at a wake.

1201
01:21:01,294 --> 01:21:05,005
I'm not worried
about Micky taking down his opponent.

1202
01:21:05,006 --> 01:21:08,300
I'm worried about whether this bitch is gonna make it
to the fourth round.

1203
01:21:08,301 --> 01:21:11,178
What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?

1204
01:21:11,179 --> 01:21:13,764
We're going to be killed
before we can get out of the building,

1205
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:17,765
and I think they'll feed it to the pigs.

1206
01:21:19,145 --> 01:21:22,105
Why are you so calm?

1207
01:21:22,106 --> 01:21:25,067
-I said...
-I heard what you said, Tommy! -I heard what you said!

1208
01:21:25,068 --> 01:21:28,028
You don't have a choice, do you?

1209
01:21:28,029 --> 01:21:31,365
Show me how to hold
that fucking gypsy,

1210
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:34,312
...and I'm gonna show you how to handle
of a cold-hearted thug,

1211
01:21:34,313 --> 01:21:36,994
who feeds human meat to pigs.

1212
01:21:36,995 --> 01:21:40,995
Oh, shit. I'm gonna go for a walk.

1213
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:22,581
Fucking dog!

1214
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:25,042
Hold her.

1215
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:29,043
-Something smells in here.
-Open the window.

1216
01:22:36,513 --> 01:22:39,265
You live like animals.

1217
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:41,225
Okay, where's the rock?

1218
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:43,644
-Well, where is he?
-He's here.

1219
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:47,645
-Where? -Where?
-I left it in the box.

1220
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,237
It's empty.

1221
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:57,238
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
Tony, do something scary.

1222
01:22:57,284 --> 01:22:59,619
No, I'm serious!

1223
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:03,620
A dog. The dog must have eaten him.

1224
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:09,834
Well, let's have a look. Tony.

1225
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:14,631
-What?
-Look in the dog.

1226
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,760
-What do you mean, look in the dog? -What do you mean, look in the dog?
-Well, I mean, open it up.

1227
01:23:21,975 --> 01:23:25,478
It's not a fucking can of beans.
What do you mean, open it?

1228
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:29,479
You know exactly what I mean.

1229
01:23:30,067 --> 01:23:33,069
Well, that's a bit much.

1230
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,696
I don't know anymore.

1231
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:39,697
No, don't do that.

1232
01:23:40,077 --> 01:23:41,702
She's fucking beeping!

1233
01:23:41,703 --> 01:23:45,749
Haven't you ever heard a dog squeak?
Give me the damn gun!

1234
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:52,418
I'll shoot that dog!

1235
01:23:58,344 --> 01:24:02,344
Fucking kill her!

1236
01:24:10,815 --> 01:24:14,815
You sneaky bastard!

1237
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:29,538
Oh, thank God.

1238
01:24:37,049 --> 01:24:41,049
I fucking hate dogs! Come on, Tony!

1239
01:24:43,306 --> 01:24:47,306
Tony, let's go.

1240
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:57,316
Tony?

1241
01:25:06,787 --> 01:25:10,787
-You want to declare something? -Yes.
-Yes. -Never go to England.

1242
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:16,251
The dog will go back to the campground.
She goes back there all the time.

1243
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,715
How will the dog find the campsite?

1244
01:25:18,716 --> 01:25:21,217
Saul, have you smelled what it smells like in there?

1245
01:25:21,218 --> 01:25:24,387
All right.
But first we'll wait until dawn.

1246
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:26,556
In the meantime, we need to get rid of the bodies.

1247
01:25:26,557 --> 01:25:30,143
This one, with the teapot case on his head,
is starting to stink.

1248
01:25:30,144 --> 01:25:35,191
Right. Let's get them in the car,
and then we'll go look for a pig farm.

1249
01:25:38,444 --> 01:25:41,863
Mickey.

1250
01:25:41,864 --> 01:25:45,659
Micky!

1251
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:49,660
Miki, are you feeling okay?

1252
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:54,250
I need a drink.

1253
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:55,919
You can't let him drink!

1254
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,920
It's not for him. It's for me.

1255
01:26:03,511 --> 01:26:07,511
Ah, guys. Amen.

1256
01:26:12,478 --> 01:26:15,424
That Anderson-- Good night--
is a tough bastard.

1257
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:17,940
So be careful.

1258
01:26:17,941 --> 01:26:20,067
You got it, Micky?

1259
01:26:20,068 --> 01:26:24,068
Micky!

1260
01:26:25,865 --> 01:26:28,826
I need a hangover!

1261
01:26:28,827 --> 01:26:33,540
If you see a gypsy, Turetsky or his girlfriend
or his girlfriend walking down the street in front of me.

1262
01:26:33,832 --> 01:26:37,832
...shoot the bastards.

1263
01:26:38,128 --> 01:26:42,128
All right, then. We got a fight to go to.

1264
01:26:47,804 --> 01:26:50,139
All right, Tom.

1265
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,205
I hope this time we have
a fucking fight this time.

1266
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:54,518
Yeah, I hope so.

1267
01:26:54,519 --> 01:26:57,062
Miki will lay down in the fourth.

1268
01:26:57,063 --> 01:26:59,857
Terry's over there taking bets.

1269
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:01,775
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1270
01:27:01,776 --> 01:27:05,776
Forgiveness will be when he lies down.

1271
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:11,616
-Are our guys at the campground yet?
-Uh, yeah.

1272
01:27:13,872 --> 01:27:17,872
I hate fucking gypsies.

1273
01:27:18,126 --> 01:27:19,460
How long do we have to sit here?

1274
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:23,255
As long as it takes.
Now shut up.

1275
01:27:23,256 --> 01:27:26,383
I hate fucking gypsies.

1276
01:27:26,384 --> 01:27:28,844
Is he fucking drunk?

1277
01:27:28,845 --> 01:27:31,138
He's always like this before a fight.

1278
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:33,724
Do you know when you're supposed to go to bed?

1279
01:27:33,725 --> 01:27:36,518
Of course he knows when he has to lie down.

1280
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:40,732
Hey, fuckface, who's asking you?
He asked him, all right?

1281
01:27:41,066 --> 01:27:43,901
Fucking snout? Well said, Errol.

1282
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:46,528
I'll remember that the next time
when I'm getting off your mom.

1283
01:27:46,529 --> 01:27:50,074
-Not now.
-It's not a fight, it's a tragedy.

1284
01:27:50,075 --> 01:27:53,202
It's a good one. A real war.

1285
01:27:53,203 --> 01:27:55,996
Not yours.

1286
01:27:55,997 --> 01:27:59,997
Then there's a whole bunch of gypsies who might not find this
might not find it fucking funny.

1287
01:28:00,126 --> 01:28:04,126
Especially when they're
putting out their torched kids.

1288
01:28:04,965 --> 01:28:08,965
Get the fuck in the ring.

1289
01:28:12,889 --> 01:28:16,889
Three rounds and you'll get your brains blown out, gypsy!

1290
01:29:06,859 --> 01:29:10,153
Okay, I'm in charge here. No fucking around,
no pointing fingers in my eyes.

1291
01:29:10,154 --> 01:29:14,154
Let's do our best. Let's go!

1292
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:47,812
What the fuck?
You gonna kill him or what?

1293
01:30:31,068 --> 01:30:34,946
Do you realize the consequences
if you knock him out?

1294
01:30:34,947 --> 01:30:38,947
Don't knock him out, Mickey.

1295
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:47,831
Break.

1296
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:22,451
Is he fucking deaf?

1297
01:31:22,452 --> 01:31:26,452
What's he doing?

1298
01:31:39,969 --> 01:31:43,969
Go sit down.

1299
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,350
What the fuck are you doing, Micky?

1300
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:48,727
Why are you dancing like a fairy?

1301
01:31:48,728 --> 01:31:52,147
If they find out you're mucking around,
they're gonna hang us.

1302
01:31:52,148 --> 01:31:55,692
Go ahead, hit him.

1303
01:31:55,693 --> 01:32:00,531
But just don't fucking knock him out.

1304
01:33:20,902 --> 01:33:24,902
All he has to do is not get up.

1305
01:33:28,368 --> 01:33:32,368
Well, now we're fucked.

1306
01:33:38,837 --> 01:33:40,046
He can't get up.

1307
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:41,088
We gotta get outta here.

1308
01:33:41,089 --> 01:33:46,136
The dumb gypsy knew
that Brick's thugs with shotguns.

1309
01:33:46,428 --> 01:33:49,221
...sitting outside his campsite.

1310
01:33:49,222 --> 01:33:54,061
And once they kill everyone in the campground,
they'll do the same to us.

1311
01:33:56,772 --> 01:33:58,856
Have you ever been crossing the street.
and you look the wrong way?

1312
01:33:58,857 --> 01:34:00,608
Give me the fucking shotgun!

1313
01:34:00,609 --> 01:34:03,527
All of a sudden, there's a car right next to you.

1314
01:34:03,528 --> 01:34:05,279
So what are you doing?

1315
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,740
Usually some stupid thing.

1316
01:34:07,741 --> 01:34:10,868
You freeze. And your life
doesn't pass in front of you at all,

1317
01:34:10,869 --> 01:34:13,663
...because you're so fucking scared,
you can't think.

1318
01:34:13,664 --> 01:34:16,999
You just freeze with a stupid face.

1319
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,460
But gypsies don't. Why not?

1320
01:34:19,461 --> 01:34:23,461
Because he knew the cabin could be burned down.

1321
01:34:24,675 --> 01:34:27,051
I had an immediate impression,

1322
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:31,052
...that he took the death of his mother
the death of his mother.

1323
01:34:33,517 --> 01:34:36,519
And for every action, there is a counteraction.

1324
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,105
And the Gypsies' opposition

1325
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:43,106
...fucking thing.

1326
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:24,775
Pete, come in.

1327
01:35:24,776 --> 01:35:28,776
If you want your friend to hear you,
speak up.

1328
01:35:37,372 --> 01:35:41,371
-Give me the fucking shotgun!
-I'll give it to you, motherfucker.

1329
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:52,966
That's when I thought that the gypsy
was betting all the money on himself all the time.

1330
01:35:53,638 --> 01:35:57,638
That's why the bastard wouldn't go to bed
when he had to.

1331
01:35:58,935 --> 01:36:02,354
He was shoeing us,

1332
01:36:02,355 --> 01:36:06,107
...and he profited.

1333
01:36:06,108 --> 01:36:10,108
And now we find ourselves in a position
even worse than when we started.

1334
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,910
The next day we headed to the campground.

1335
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:20,288
During the night, the gypsies disappeared.

1336
01:36:20,289 --> 01:36:22,540
It was probably for the best,

1337
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:26,879
...considering that somewhere around here.
they buried 12 people.

1338
01:36:27,255 --> 01:36:28,880
Where is he?

1339
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:31,800
We're not gonna fucking find him, I'm telling you.

1340
01:36:31,801 --> 01:36:35,553
We can't get a man to participate
in a fight if we can't find him, can we?

1341
01:36:35,554 --> 01:36:39,554
You can't find a gypsy who doesn't want to be found,
to be found, Tommy.

1342
01:36:41,018 --> 01:36:45,018
He and his rabble are fucking nowhere,
somewhere in Kampuchea.

1343
01:36:45,815 --> 01:36:49,815
Shit. Let's go.

1344
01:36:52,905 --> 01:36:56,905
-What are you doing here?
-What's it to you?

1345
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:03,620
What are you doing here again?

1346
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:13,380
I'm walking the dog. What's the matter?

1347
01:37:13,926 --> 01:37:15,510
What's in the car?

1348
01:37:15,511 --> 01:37:18,179
Seats and steering wheel.

1349
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:21,766
What do you know about gypsies?

1350
01:37:21,767 --> 01:37:25,767
I know they can't be trusted.

1351
01:37:25,813 --> 01:37:29,357
All right, take your dog. And get out of here.

1352
01:37:29,358 --> 01:37:32,736
Get the dog, Tommy.

1353
01:37:32,737 --> 01:37:35,572
Get the dog.

1354
01:37:35,573 --> 01:37:39,994
All right, then. Come here. Come here.
Stop. Daisy, Daisy!

1355
01:37:40,786 --> 01:37:42,829
Loves the doggie.

1356
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,789
He's always playing with her
playing stupid games with her all the time.

1357
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:48,790
Stop fiddling and get in the car. Tommy!

1358
01:37:50,046 --> 01:37:54,759
Good, good.
Good doggy, Daisy, good doggy.

1359
01:38:05,602 --> 01:38:07,394
Can you give me a hint,

1360
01:38:07,395 --> 01:38:11,231
what's in your trunk
a corpse with a severed arm doing in your trunk?

1361
01:38:11,232 --> 01:38:13,651
George,

1362
01:38:13,652 --> 01:38:17,652
check it out. What's that on his head--
is that a teapot warmer or something?

1363
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:23,240
Oh, you like the doggie, huh, Tommy?

1364
01:38:31,586 --> 01:38:34,380
Tommy convinced me to keep the dog.

1365
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:38,259
It took me a while, but I agreed on the condition
he'd take her to the vet first.

1366
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:41,011
Her squeaking is getting to be annoying.

1367
01:38:41,012 --> 01:38:42,805
And the vet found a dog in his stomach

1368
01:38:42,806 --> 01:38:44,598
a half-digested shoe,
a squeaky toy, and, uh.

1369
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:48,519
...an 84-carat diamond.

1370
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,438
It's amazing how many things
can happen in a week.

1371
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,316
She still won't shut up.

1372
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:56,443
Well, what's it gonna be?

1373
01:38:56,444 --> 01:38:59,571
You go to a man
who knows about these things.

1374
01:38:59,572 --> 01:39:02,908
Well, what do you think?

1375
01:39:02,909 --> 01:39:06,909
You don't know anyone
who might be interested?

1376
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Maybe me.
