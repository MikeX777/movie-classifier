1
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,625
What am I doing here?

2
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,333
Distant and dreamy,

3
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,416
everything I love about
romantic engravings.

4
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,750
Household chores can wait, come with me.

5
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,875
I am a man of rituals and habit.

6
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,041
Our walk is sacred,

7
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,125
and I am pious.

8
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,666
<i>The passage of time is a mystery to me.</i>

9
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,750
<i>We are a couple.</i>

10
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,041
<i>People say,</i>

11
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,416
<i>"Geneviève and Sylvain love each other."</i>

12
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
<i>"They're happy."</i>

13
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,916
<i>But what does that really mean?</i>

14
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,416
<i>Are we still the same today</i>

15
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,875
<i>as we were when we arrived here</i>
<i>ten months ago?</i>

16
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,875
<i>When I met Sylvain, I knew right away</i>
<i>that our lives would be connected.</i>

17
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,625
<i>I thought I was free.</i>
<i>I was working for an editor</i>

18
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,125
<i>and one day, I met him in a hallway</i>

19
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,083
<i>Romantic, brilliant, and a little mad,</i>

20
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,916
<i>I knew of his reputation.</i>

21
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,375
<i>We had published his first book</i>
<i>five years earlier,</i>

22
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,291
I'm<i> not sure that we sold many copies,</i>
<i>but it caused a stir.</i>

23
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,916
<i>He hadn't written anything since then.</i>

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>He was content to tell his friends</i>
<i>about his future books</i>

25
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,500
<i>without bothering to write them.</i>

26
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>He behaved the same way</i>

27
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,416
<i>with girls.</i>

28
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,750
<i>He liked to impress them,</i>

29
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,375
<i>to seduce them.</i>

30
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,750
<i>He succeeded without effort,</i>

31
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,125
<i>but a week later, it was over.</i>

32
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,833
<i>At first, I thought I was</i>
<i>just another piece in his collection</i>

33
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,791
<i>I expected it and it didn't bother me.</i>

34
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,541
<i>To my great surprise, it was not the case.</i>

35
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,083
<i>Our feelings quickly became quite serious,</i>

36
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,416
<i>and I was delighted.</i>

37
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,375
<i>I don't believe in love without respect.</i>

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,875
<i>His way of life suddenly</i>
<i>became unbearable to him.</i>

39
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>He asked me to marry him</i>
<i>and run away with him</i>

40
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,125
<i>far from everything,</i>
<i>in a hermitage, of sorts.</i>

41
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,666
<i>Are there still</i>
<i>enchanted islands in today's world?</i>

42
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,666
<i>I know of one.</i>

43
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,333
<i>The ghost in an extravagant dream.</i>

44
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,291
<i>A man, a utopian and an architect,</i>

45
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,916
<i>dreamt under Louis XV,</i>
<i>of building the ideal city,</i>

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,833
<i>like Le Corbusier, but 200 years earlier.</i>

47
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,958
<i>The King gave him the money and he began,</i>

48
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,666
<i>then the King died</i>
<i>and everything came to a halt.</i>

49
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,541
<i>In the countryside remains half of a</i>
<i>factory that was built like the Parthenon</i>

50
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,583
<i>Useless and uninhabited,</i>

51
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,458
<i>the miraculously preserved trace</i>
<i>of a generous act of folly.</i>

52
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>His name was Claude-Nicolas Ledoux.</i>

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,791
<i>He believed in happiness</i>
<i>and making others happy.</i>

54
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,916
<i>There are magical places,</i>
<i>and La Saline des Chaux is one of them.</i>

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
<i>We could live there, rent a house</i>
<i>that can be our hermitage.</i>

56
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,041
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

57
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,583
<i>I'll work.</i>
<i>You'll love me and I'll love you.</i>

58
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,666
<i>We'll be happy.</i>

59
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,625
<i>Ten months of loneliness</i>
<i>and ten months of daily routine.</i>

60
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,375
<i>I still love him</i>

61
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,416
<i>and he still loves me,</i>

62
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,750
<i>but we now walk in silence,</i>

63
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
<i>having nothing to say to each other.</i>

64
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,750
<i>We have a schedule.</i>

65
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,625
<i>A time to walk, a time for him to work,</i>

66
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,541
<i>and a time for love, too.</i>

67
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,833
<i>He lives,</i>

68
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,916
<i>he works,</i>

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,750
<i>I watch him.</i>

70
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,166
<i>But I don't recognize</i>
<i>the face of happiness.</i>

71
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,291
<i>This is not at all how I pictured it.</i>

72
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,541
Is it going well?

73
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,291
Yes, it is.

74
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,833
But I won't read anything to you now.

75
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,791
I don't like the draft,
notes and variants side of it.

76
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,916
You know, Henri Beyle's laundry notebooks

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,333
are supposed to have been

78
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,916
the secret to Stendhal's genius.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,083
Have you made a lot of changes
to the characters?

80
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
No, but I've enriched them,

81
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,416
they keep contradicting each other,

82
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,708
they're becoming ambiguous,

83
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,083
No hero, no traitor, no psychology.

84
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,125
A mosaic of little facts.

85
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,166
But let's not talk about that.

86
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,041
You've told me enough times,

87
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,166
a book is meant to be read, not spoken.

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,666
5:10 pm, time for recess.

89
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,750
Ring! Ring!

90
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,958
Do you remember the utopian writer,

91
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
who could have been Rousseau
or the Marquis de Sade's progeny?

92
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,708
He used to describe
the inner-workings of pleasure houses

93
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,291
with graphs and scheduled times.

94
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,041
I could never function
like the railway system!

95
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,625
7:10 fast train to Cythera.

96
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,250
-Sylvain.
-Hmm?

97
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,750
We hardly ever laugh anymore.

98
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
We don't talk, why is that?

99
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,083
You work, and I--

100
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,541
You, you,

101
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,916
you help me work.

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
Without you,
I wouldn't write a single line.

103
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,625
It's been proven.

104
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,750
Love and work are what I live on.

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I'm happy.

106
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,416
And you? Are you happy?

107
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,250
Maybe I'm a selfish monster.

108
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Am I a cold-hearted intellectual?

109
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,250
Is that what you see
when you look in the mirror?

110
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,083
The only mirror I'm interested in
is the one you see me through.

111
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,166
So, tell me.

112
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,916
It's not that easy.

113
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Living on your own is hard enough,

114
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,125
but then, together…

115
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,166
Ten thousand Greek soldiers,
lost in vast Persia

116
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,041
traveled over 2000 kilometers in battle.

117
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,833
Each soldier had a faithful companion,

118
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,416
the strongest helped the weakest.

119
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
It was their secret.

120
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,166
You and I

121
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,625
are going through life together,

122
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,000
and you are my companion.

123
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
I'm short, you know,

124
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,666
I would have carried your helmet

125
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,666
and you would have carried
both of our shields.

126
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,000
No, you're the strongest.

127
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,500
I started working again because of you.

128
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,750
Never have I found
another man this attractive.

129
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,375
And I no other woman.

130
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,166
I still tremble
when I look at you every morning.

131
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
You can't have love without worry.

132
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,291
I am worried.

133
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,500
I like that you are worried.

134
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,000
I fancy going for a walk before dinner.

135
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,708
Are you coming?

136
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,291
I can't. Go and play by yourself.

137
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,166
<i>Of course,</i>

138
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,250
<i>feelings age as people do</i>

139
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,666
<i>and suffer the weight</i>

140
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,375
<i>of routine and habit.</i>

141
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,750
<i>If one wonders,</i>
<i>it probably means one doubts a little.</i>

142
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,666
<i>Believers say, "If you don't have faith,</i>

143
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,875
<i>offer a prayer and faith will come.</i>

144
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>I have just offered a prayer.</i>

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,500
<i>I think I love him, I think he loves me.</i>

146
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,291
<i>But when I think about our life together,</i>

147
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,375
<i>I cannot help but wonder</i>
<i>what it is becoming.</i>

148
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,625
<i>Is it still the same?</i>

149
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,000
-So, still deserted?
-It's that time of the year.

150
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,000
But the Scotch Lovers Club
is gaining two members.

151
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,083
-The President and his wife just arrived.
-The President?

152
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,708
Yes, Jacques Symphon. He is our great man.

153
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,791
Ah, Jacques Symphon… Yes, of course,

154
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,666
isn't he the former youngest minister
of the century?

155
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,291
Mayor, Chairman of the District Council,

156
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541
and he owns factories and a newspaper.

157
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,291
Interesting. I saw this in the south,

158
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,958
I thought it was just a local thing

159
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,791
you know, those dynasties
that are half political, half financial,

160
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
feudal lords.

161
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,375
But he is very useful and obliging.

162
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,666
I think that's him.

163
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,416
That's right, I supply him, as I do you.

164
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,750
But on a larger scale, no offense to you.

165
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,791
-Hello, Jean.
-Hello, madam.

166
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,250
-The usual order.
-It's ready for you, madam.

167
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,166
There isn't much for today,
but I will have more on Monday.

168
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,291
We can talk tomorrow, I have to go.

169
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,125
-Goodbye, Jean.
-Goodbye, madam.

170
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,875
So, where were we? I think it's my turn.

171
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,291
That was the first lady.

172
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,041
Does she come here often?

173
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,250
Almost every day at this time.

174
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,625
<i>Idleness or curiosity, I couldn't say,</i>

175
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,125
<i>I was, as the Italians say, unoccupied.</i>

176
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,041
<i>Since I knew she would return,</i>
<i>I got into the habit of going back,</i>

177
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>certain I would see her sooner or later.</i>

178
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,583
<i>When you meet a girl in an ordinary place,</i>

179
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,750
<i>there is a good chance</i>
<i>you will see her again.</i>

180
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>It's just a question of</i>
<i>patience and organization.</i>

181
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,041
I'm delighted to see you again, sir.

182
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,458
Me too, Jean, me too.

183
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,333
-Black Label, of course.
-Of course.

184
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,166
Well, aren't you secretive,

185
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,041
you should have known that
I too enjoy Black Label.

186
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,083
His loyalty to me guarantees
his loyalty to you, right?

187
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,166
Thank you, sir.

188
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,166
Jacques Symphon,<i> The Local Times.</i>

189
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,041
Pleasure, Sylvain Bollinger.

190
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,916
<i>From the very first words we exchanged,</i>

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,916
<i>I knew that Jacques and I</i>
<i>were going to be friends.</i>

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,041
<i>His slightly lazy humor,</i>
<i>the self-mockery he always put forward</i>

193
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:59,125
<i>lifted almost immediately any issue</i>
<i>I had with every politician.</i>

194
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,166
<i>We saw each other every day,</i>
<i>every day for a little more time.</i>

195
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,041
<i>as though we had always known each other.</i>

196
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,166
<i>He ended up behaving toward me</i>
<i>as if I were one of his oldest friends.</i>

197
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,791
<i>Not because I was,</i>

198
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,208
<i>but simply because he did not have</i>
<i>anyone else to talk with freely.</i>

199
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,125
You cannot image the isolation
that comes with being a public figure.

200
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,333
You no longer listen to what people say
to you, but rather why they are saying it.

201
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,416
Saint-Simon.

202
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,875
Yes, but I find his pessimism
a little suspicious.

203
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,541
In reality, what he's mostly complaining
about, is not having been minister.

204
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,416
Yes, one should always
be leery of reasoning

205
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,958
that is convenient for the person
who is doing the reasoning.

206
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,666
Just like a novelist who makes
a mockery of success

207
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,791
without ever having experienced it.

208
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,750
And that's what is beautiful with Sagan.

209
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,166
When people talk to her about her success,
she doesn't say "I deserved it"

210
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,541
but rather "a lucky break."

211
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,416
It's was smart and brave.

212
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,833
By the way, I was thinking,
you've never been to the house,

213
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,541
I'd really like to meet your wife.

214
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,416
Come and have dinner one evening.
Whenever you'd like.

215
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,416
I too would like to meet the First Lady.

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,416
Goodness,
aren't you sinister this evening.

217
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,708
If you really don't want to go
to this dinner, we can cancel.

218
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,416
First of all, we can't because
you have no intention of canceling.

219
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,541
I will, if you insist.

220
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,791
I don't really mind,
but I don't get the point.

221
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,833
What point?!

222
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,958
Well, we are going to get dressed up
and make all kinds of efforts

223
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,416
for people we don't even know.

224
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,375
You're interested in mundane
trivialities all of a sudden?

225
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,791
That's new.

226
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,916
We came here so you could work.
So I could watch you work.

227
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,375
To love each other.

228
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,250
Remember?

229
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,541
That's all I think about.

230
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,125
But what does that have to do with this?

231
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:50,416
These people are friendly, intelligent,
a little isolated, like we are.

232
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,958
Strange solitude.

233
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,916
More than you think.
They have no friends, just clients.

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,416
Fine.

235
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,041
Besides, we can say that psychology

236
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,916
is a vast fraud, a kind of swing…

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,458
The Bordeaux in the small glasses.

238
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,666
-I know.
-I'm not so sure.

239
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,208
Jacques says Hemingway
is the only sensible psychologist.

240
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,708
There still is a difference.

241
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,583
Hemingway or Dos Passos' heroes
don't have a brain to think with.

242
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,541
It's that simple.

243
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,208
When a man writes a story about a woman
in which she is not a slave,

244
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
he has her behave like a man.

245
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,416
Dialectically, we will have
to endure the matriarchy.

246
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,541
Women in power,
for at least a little while.

247
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,375
I'm not sure they will ever have reason
to complain about it.

248
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,041
Jacques has a great issue
on the future of grey matter.

249
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,750
And ultimately,
women are much more resistant than men.

250
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,791
Your theories reminded me of something.

251
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,166
I'm sure you don't like jokes, but well…

252
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,458
A young actor, who is playing Hamlet
becomes very passionate about his role.

253
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,541
And so, he thinks, he searches,

254
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,625
and it becomes a fixation.
"What is the meaning of life?"

255
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,041
Naturally, he becomes a saint,
a real certified one.

256
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,125
He doesn't make any miracles,
though almost.

257
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,041
And finally one day, he dies.

258
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,708
Of course, being a saint,
he goes directly to heaven.

259
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,166
and he meets Saint Peter.

260
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,666
The first question he asks is, "And God?"

261
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,416
"What about God? He is the way
we've always described him,

262
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,208
he's an older gentleman,
handsome, with a long beard."

263
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,375
"Oh."

264
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,416
"Does he speak?"

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,666
"Oh yes, he talks a lot
and he always says the same thing.

266
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,458
But see for yourself,
you're allowed to, you know."

267
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,041
They go down a long corridor,

268
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,250
at the end of the corridor
is a large door.

269
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,541
He bends down
and discretely looks through the keyhole.

270
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:37,125
Indeed, he sees a very old man with
a long white beard, lost in a daydream.

271
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,833
"Do you think he is going to speak?"
asks the actor.

272
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,916
"Yes, yes," says Saint Peter,
but be patient.

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They listen,

274
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,916
and all of a sudden, they see the old man
come out of his daydream and they hear,

275
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,416
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."

276
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,208
That was great!

277
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,250
I love metaphysical humor!

278
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,583
When a magician
pulls a rabbit out of a hat,

279
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,583
anyone with any sense knows that
the rabbit was already somewhere.

280
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,250
Your theory on free women
is great and all,

281
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,000
but I wonder where your reality is hiding.

282
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,291
You mean my experience?

283
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,583
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

284
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,875
You should have.

285
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,666
It would be funny if you spoke
less clearly than you write.

286
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,916
Oh, I don't write much.

287
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,750
I read your<i> Season of the Uncles.</i>

288
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,333
The story of three women who share guys

289
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,916
the way men share girls,
I don't believe it for a second.

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,208
Don't tell me you believe in fidelity?

291
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,333
I believe that you can be faithful
to something that someone gives you

292
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,750
and that only they give you.

293
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,041
Even if it's just a small estate.

294
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,041
You say that,
but deep down you are an Amazon.

295
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,875
Are you saying you are afraid of me?

296
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,375
-Sylvain…
-You know I can hold a liter.

297
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,916
People don't fully experience
their love stories.

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,041
They try to make them
fit into social conventions.

299
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,916
They could love in a very different way,
if they wanted to.

300
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,416
So you think that
willingness is part of love?

301
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,541
Are you cold?
It gets chilly at night here.

302
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,666
No, your fire is delightful.

303
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,250
Well, of course it's better to know
people, that not know them.

304
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,208
I have a young niece, she's lovely.

305
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
You should hear her
talk about her new lover.

306
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,125
Quickly, in silence and in the dark!

307
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,083
The first time is always a disappointment.

308
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,583
And then the second
is better than the first,

309
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,041
and the hundredth better than the second.

310
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,250
You'll have to forgive us,
but we have become quite provincial.

311
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,541
Let me get your coat.

312
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,791
What, already?

313
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,958
I'm very tired.

314
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,875
-But you can stay if you'd like.
-You know that I can't.

315
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,750
Alright, let's go.

316
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,291
Good night and thank you.

317
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,875
Good night, until next time.

318
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,916
You're not going up to bed?

319
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,041
No, I have a speech to work on.

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,916
You were very quiet during dinner.
It wasn't like you.

321
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,166
The most brilliant chatterbox
of his generation.

322
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,250
In any case, the mute is very beautiful.

323
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,500
Your talker wasn't bad-looking either.

324
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,125
Sylvain!

325
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,291
Everyone takes me for
an intellectual of few words,

326
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,083
Don't assume.

327
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,750
Well, I am a lyrical poet.

328
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,208
A hidden, suppressed lyrical poet.

329
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,583
A slave to lyricism
expresses himself only in parables,

330
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,458
I only believe in parables.

331
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,500
-Whose slave? Not mine?
-Of course, yours!

332
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,916
You are all I think about.

333
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,666
Every minute of every day.

334
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,000
-I am suspicious of your words.
-And every minute of every night.

335
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,625
I don't know anymore.

336
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,666
-We could be happy.
-Hey, we are.

337
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,666
Sylvain, I feel like I'm losing you.

338
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,375
Geneviève…

339
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,875
What's wrong?

340
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,250
Geneviève, answer me.

341
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
You started working again because of me.

342
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,125
The biggest lie in the world.

343
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,416
Sometimes there's nothing you can do.

344
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,416
No one can.

345
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,750
No, Sylvain, it's not that simple.

346
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,250
Don't you love me anymore?

347
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,541
I don't know. I don't know anymore.

348
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,041
I don't forgive you.
I don't want to forgive you.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,333
Rolande, I'm on schedule,

350
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,625
-I'll have my breakfast downstairs.
-Very well, sir.

351
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:25,416
He's coming down now, Miss Michele.
He will have breakfast while he works.

352
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,250
Thank you, Miss Rolande.

353
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,791
-Good morning, Michele.
-Good morning, sir. I'll be right there.

354
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,041
Take your time.

355
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,125
So, Solange,

356
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,916
How are the declensions going?

357
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:58,416
Perfect, but I stand by my point of view,

358
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,666
nine is a little young for Latin.

359
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,041
Yes. Montaigne spoke Greek aged five.

360
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,041
Well, he did.

361
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,916
-What shall we begin with?
-The mail, if you don't mind.

362
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,250
There are two letters that I did not open.

363
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,416
You know that you could have.

364
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,875
-I live in a glass house.
-I didn't want to read them.

365
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,166
You still have some shyness in you,
how wonderful.

366
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,125
And the rest?

367
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,000
Bills…

368
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,875
requests to honor,

369
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,208
requests to consider,

370
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,791
requests to deny.

371
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,500
Who is waiting?

372
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:45,708
Public Affairs, Mr. Chantavoine, Private
Affairs, the manager, the gamekeeper.

373
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,541
and the squire, your dear Sandra's father.

374
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:52,208
Mr. Hubert would like a word first,
and then you can see him afterwards.

375
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,291
Very well.

376
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,333
Go get them and then group them together.

377
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,416
Yes, sir.

378
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,708
I've written a general statement
and an investment plan.

379
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:01,916
Yes.

380
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,458
You should see them
before you meet with Chantavoine.

381
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,375
Gentlemen, if you please,
let's start with the simple problems.

382
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:16,166
So, let us sum up.
You can sell your timber,

383
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,458
you can buy the horse,
it's a little expensive,

384
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,333
but if Sandra likes it…

385
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,666
For the pheasants, I am going to wait.

386
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,750
Gentlemen.

387
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,041
-He's in top form this morning.
-I had nothing to do with it.

388
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,250
-No?
-I swear.

389
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,541
-Did you sleep well?
-Oh, please…

390
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,875
Oh no, romantic sorrow and no consolation?

391
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,708
There is going to be trouble
in your paradise.

392
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,750
Hush, please.

393
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,291
He agrees, would you like
to review the details?

394
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,416
No, you can decide.

395
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,791
-Which details?
-No, nothing.

396
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,416
The sawmill under the big dam.

397
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,416
-You call that details?
-Listen, Françoise,

398
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,541
Chantavoine is looking into it,
I told him to see you later,

399
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,916
you and Hubert can decide.

400
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,791
And you're a dilletante. Charming.

401
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,750
I would like you to be less aggressive.

402
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,041
And I would like you
to stop hiding things from me.

403
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,416
You're one to talk.

404
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,458
Well, at least
I don't do anything behind your back.

405
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:17,458
Françoise, you know that you are free
to do whatever you'd like

406
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,541
except a scandal,

407
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:22,125
you can tell me anything,
but not in front of the help.

408
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,250
That's charming for Hubert.

409
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,666
I impose this discipline on myself.

410
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,750
Fine.

411
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,750
Tell me about the young couple
you brought over yesterday.

412
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,875
-What is it?
-Nothing, sir, you look handsome.

413
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,708
And that's funny?

414
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,041
In spring, the roosters
become the most beautiful birds

415
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,166
-The season of--
-Careful, Michèle.

416
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,583
We're alone.

417
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,625
That doesn't happen very often anymore.

418
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,541
But we have our memories.

419
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
No blackmail.

420
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:11,875
Impossible,
I would be just as compromised as you.

421
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,541
<i>Am I blind?</i>

422
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:34,833
<i>After ten years together,</i>

423
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:38,708
<i>the choice is no longer limited</i>
<i>to the blindness of comfort or to cynicism</i>

424
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:43,000
<i>or perhaps something else,</i>
<i>like an almost fraternal bond.</i>

425
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,666
<i>I am not oblivious to Jacques' affairs.</i>

426
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,458
<i>For example, Jacques spends lavishly</i>

427
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,166
<i>on Sandra, our squire's daughter.</i>

428
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,958
<i>This guarantees his wisdom,</i>

429
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:58,291
<i>the athletic joy Sandra provides for him</i>
<i>does not take anything away from mine.</i>

430
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,791
You have no idea how happy I am!

431
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,125
-I see that.
-She is wonderful!

432
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,791
Arthur, a horse for Mr. Jacques!

433
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,541
Take Fedor, he hasn't been out today.

434
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:41,500
-Shall we go?
-Of course we shall.

435
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,916
With her I could win
the qualifying round, at the very least!

436
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,750
I wonder what makes you run,
little sphinx.

437
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:41,916
The same thing that makes fire burn,
and makes opium soothing.

438
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,416
And the virtue… wait, I remember,
the sleeping virtue of opium…

439
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,875
And that is why your daughter is mute.

440
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,541
What have you done with your virtue,
little sphinx?

441
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,375
Do not be cheeky, or ungrateful.

442
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,125
What are you looking for out of life?

443
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,041
Company from a nice man, like you.

444
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,041
You know, I despise spite.

445
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,666
I only like to laugh.

446
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,041
That's no life.

447
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,250
Well then, maybe I'm a mummy.

448
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,375
It's a mystery,
what's in that little head of yours.

449
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,666
Don't complain.

450
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,416
You don't love me.

451
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,916
Have you ever asked me to?

452
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,500
No, of course not.

453
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,750
But you know, sometimes…

454
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,750
I regret it.

455
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,625
I never do. I'm free.

456
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,166
I choose my horses…

457
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,666
and my men.

458
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,416
You taught me everything.

459
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,541
You shouldn't regret anything.

460
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,250
Diane…

461
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,583
<i>A botanist loves the diversity of plants,</i>

462
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:17,041
<i>Jacques acts like a botanist</i>
<i>when it comes to women.</i>

463
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,750
<i>There is an astonishing creature</i>
<i>in his life,</i>

464
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:23,041
<i>who is always difficult to identify,</i>
<i>in her various guises.</i>

465
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,041
<i>To tell the truth, Anne-Marie</i>

466
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,083
<i>is probably more fauna than flora.</i>

467
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:30,083
<i>Some people enjoy</i>
<i>taking a backseat,</i>

468
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,666
<i>but Anne-Marie enjoys taking the wheel.</i>

469
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,833
<i>A rich and free foreigner,</i>

470
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,500
<i>she treats our town</i>
<i>as a stronghold to be removed</i>

471
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:41,166
<i>she captures its men as one would</i>
<i>the daughters of defeated lords.</i>

472
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,791
<i>I envy this creature of prey,</i>
<i>but mostly, I find her amusing.</i>

473
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:50,375
<i>And I can also see what a superior variety</i>
<i>of amusement she provides for Jacques.</i>

474
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:13,541
What is wrong with you?
Have you read too many detective stories?

475
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,458
I didn't want people to see us together.

476
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,666
Are you looking out for
your reputation or mine?

477
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,041
-Look, my dear, really--
-If it's mine, you're wasting your time.

478
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,791
I couldn't care less! And as for yours--

479
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,083
I am a public figure.

480
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,333
For girls who are public figures,
it's the opposite!

481
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,666
Anne-Marie, let's not argue. Come along!

482
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,791
It's been over a week
since you abandoned me,

483
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,583
you have me exploring
the forest like some girl scout.

484
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:42,791
-And you dare claim to--
-I am not claiming anything.

485
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,291
-Jacques.
-Anne-Marie.

486
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,291
-You are mad.
-Why on earth?

487
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,750
Do you find it fun?
Nature, the forest, all of it.

488
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,041
Love should be made in bed.

489
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:09,625
With space, time.

490
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,000
-Do you see?
-I see.

491
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,541
<i>One gets caught up</i>
<i>in the uncertainties of vocabulary.</i>

492
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,791
<i>Am I really being deceived?</i>
<i>I do not think so.</i>

493
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,791
<i>For ten years, Jacques,</i>
<i>my partner in crime</i>

494
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,541
<i>has offered me</i>
<i>the most precious of loyalties</i>

495
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,541
<i>and everyone would probably laugh</i>
<i>if I mentioned it.</i>

496
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,250
Still working?

497
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,916
Does the saw mill issue worry you?

498
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,166
Well at least
someone in the family is worried.

499
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,416
Oh, Françoise, you wouldn't be doing it
if you didn't want to.

500
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,750
-I never said I was forcing myself.
-Oh, why so serious…

501
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,041
Jacques, I'd like to talk to you.

502
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,333
I don't believe in explanations,
they muddle everything.

503
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,166
An apology for the incommunicable.
Surprising coming from you.

504
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,166
We have said everything there is to say.
A thousand times.

505
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,000
Do you think so?

506
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:17,125
-We're friends.
-The best in the world.

507
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,250
-Let's keep it that way.
-Of course.

508
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:25,666
You know, I shouldn't go into blaming.

509
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,750
But…

510
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,416
I think that you are lacking
more and more conviction.

511
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,333
The September elections, for example.

512
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:35,375
-Look, Chantavoine is taking care of it.
-That has nothing to do with it.

513
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,041
Anyway…

514
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,625
do what you think is best.

515
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,791
Just be careful.

516
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,625
-Good bye, darling.
-Good bye.

517
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,041
-Shall I take the Mercedes?
-I'd rather you didn't, I may go out.

518
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,125
Very well.

519
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:08,083
<i>Inalterable perfection, tireless activity,</i>
<i>unimaginable understanding.</i>

520
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:12,000
<i>It's wonderful. But we have</i>
<i>nothing left to say to each other.</i>

521
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,750
<i>I wonder if there is a secret to wisdom.</i>
<i>Or rather, a secret to happiness.</i>

522
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,458
<i>Deep down, I don't think so.</i>

523
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:25,625
<i>Perhaps what Françoise suffers from</i>
<i>the most, is her balance and freedom.</i>

524
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,583
-I thought you were at Chantavoine's.
-I would like to speak with you.

525
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:36,416
About the midterms?
We will put Boudu

526
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,958
at the top of the ballot.

527
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,916
And Doctor Fauque second, it's in the bag.

528
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,041
-I completely agree, it's just that--
-Was there something else?

529
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,791
-Not exactly.
-Well, then?

530
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:52,000
-I…
-Timing is everything, my dear Hubert.

531
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,500
No sulking.

532
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,750
-But I…
-Everything is perfect.

533
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,208
Be good.

534
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,625
So, Antonio,
what is the performance index?

535
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,000
Here you are, madam.
I've put everything in net.

536
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,750
-How is your little girl?
-Very well, thank you, madam.

537
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,291
You see, I even drew a curve.

538
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,375
I see.

539
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,541
You'll need to explain the details to me.

540
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:49,041
Come by and see me
at the château tomorrow afternoon.

541
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,416
<i>Irreproachable. Discretion as its best.</i>

542
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,541
<i>The wife of a great lord</i>

543
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,791
<i>who ran the duchy flawlessly,</i>

544
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,791
<i>maybe without admitting it to herself,</i>

545
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,250
<i>that had to be it.</i>

546
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,083
So you really think that in the finals--

547
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,625
Oh, yes, he has the best chance.

548
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,875
Here's a visitor. For you?

549
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I hope so.

550
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,458
What a wonderful surprise.
We never see you.

551
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,416
Sylvain lets me know how you are doing.

552
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,666
I've asked him a hundred times
to bring you along.

553
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,166
I barely go out.

554
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,791
Have you seen my stables?

555
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,166
A folly.

556
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,708
-I like them.
-Do you like to ride?

557
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,833
-Yes.
-Good.

558
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:11,791
-Melchior, take Sultan out, will you?
-Of course.

559
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,958
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

560
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,250
-Do you like it?
-It's gorgeous.

561
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,791
I actually know very little about you,
we barely know each other.

562
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,250
-I know a lot.
-Oh, well then.

563
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,416
Nothing I don't like.

564
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,375
You must have many misconceptions.

565
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:48,291
You do know that the women of
my generation are interested in politics.

566
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:53,500
In general, I don't have much respect
for established institutions.

567
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,541
I find it quite strange, taking a walk

568
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,916
with someone who is basically
the head of police.

569
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,666
Don't exaggerate!
You'll give me a guilty conscience.

570
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,541
I believe that the system we live in
is like a sort of feudalism,

571
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,666
only with dynasties
and small local governments.

572
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,125
You are something of a duke, here.

573
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,541
For me, politics can only be justified
with conviction,

574
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,125
otherwise, it's just hogwash.

575
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:24,875
-But I have convictions.
-And what are they?

576
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,750
If I had to choose between
cynicism and blindness,

577
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,291
there would be a little of both.

578
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,041
I have a certain power…

579
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,416
I enjoy it.

580
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,541
But I think I use it with moderation

581
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,125
and often for the good of others.

582
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,541
I believe in tolerance, in letting go,
I don't believe in preconceived notions.

583
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,750
I would almost think you an anarchist.

584
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,041
You fool yourself with the idea
that you are not a tyrant

585
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,791
and it gives you satisfaction.

586
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,166
But you have more contempt
for your fellow citizens

587
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,000
than those who throw them in prison.

588
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,125
Such passion.

589
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,541
I don't believe in politics
without passion

590
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,666
Let's not confuse things,
love is complicated enough.

591
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,875
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight?

592
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,875
I'll send Bastien to bring a note
to La Saline to let your husband know

593
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,416
and you and I will go directly
from the stables to the castle.

594
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,333
-Say yes?
-How can I refuse?

595
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,666
Hello.

596
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,541
I'm not sure I understand
what is happening.

597
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:56,166
Jacques ran into your wife
and decided to organize a dinner.

598
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,625
He's just called.
They'll be here in an hour.

599
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,625
-Can I offer you a drink?
-Sure.

600
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:05,166
What a beautiful painting.
Is it from the Flemish school?

601
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,166
No, a local 18th century painter.

602
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,958
I found it
at an antique dealer in Besançon.

603
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,416
I've heard there are
great antique dealers in Besançon.

604
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,625
There sure are.

605
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,541
We have made arrangements
for the chicken, madam.

606
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,916
Perfect.

607
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,291
-Scotch?
-Yes.

608
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Well…

609
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,333
We are completely out.

610
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:30,041
-Oh, it's alright.
-No.

611
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,166
Wait, I have an idea.<i> L'Auberge Anglaise,</i>

612
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,375
it's close by and the bartender always
comes to my rescue. Will you come with me?

613
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,666
I do<i> not</i> believe you.

614
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,416
You're still living in the Middle Ages.

615
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,833
A true domestic tyrant.

616
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:51,666
Sure, women think they are free.

617
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,250
Free to make choices,
free to live as they please.

618
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,500
-But it isn't true.
-How do you know?

619
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,708
Experience.

620
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:03,708
Women are creatures of caution.

621
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:06,750
-Now, don't provoke me.
-I'm not provoking, I'm just observing.

622
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,666
I find you attractive.

623
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,875
And you, me.

624
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,958
But until you do something about it…

625
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,041
You will never follow through.

626
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,500
Not with your feelings,
nor with your thoughts.

627
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,291
You have some strange ideas about women.

628
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,541
Yeah, yeah,
when it comes to giving proof, nothing…

629
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,875
Did you say proof?

630
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,250
Well, I'll give you some.

631
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,916
And when you have it,
you're the one who'll be afraid.

632
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,625
Look around you.

633
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,916
Everyone knows me
and people know who you are.

634
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,750
I'll show you what I'm capable of,

635
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,125
the risks I'm willing to take,

636
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,125
when I truly have a desire for something.

637
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,291
I'd like a room please.

638
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,166
A double, for two people.

639
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,250
Yes, madam.

640
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:33,833
Sylvain…

641
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,208
are you coming?

642
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,250
It's ready.

643
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,416
Madam?

644
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,375
Your key, madam.

645
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,541
Let's go.

646
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,541
That's what bothers me
with mundane adultery,

647
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:07,375
it always happens in first class waiting
rooms in provincial train stations.

648
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,250
I have a soul, you know.

649
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,416
Come over here.

650
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:16,916
Forgive me.

651
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,416
I talk and I talk and…

652
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,291
I need a bit of fun.

653
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:29,375
Are you unhappy?

654
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,541
Have you always been?

655
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:35,875
Always.

656
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,416
I am a sea urchin
with its quills turned inwards.

657
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,125
Poor little man.

658
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,666
It's crazy how much I would like
to be in someone else's skin.

659
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,875
They should have stores for that,
you could just rent a second skin.

660
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,666
Why would you want to change?

661
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,166
It's funny…

662
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,625
it's like shyness,

663
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,375
we have so much to say,

664
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,125
yet we stay quiet.

665
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,125
I am extremely attracted to you.

666
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,375
But I couldn't show it.

667
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,625
You must resent me terribly.

668
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,875
I have always failed first times.
I care too much.

669
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,791
I only believe in being accustomed.

670
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,666
The inner workings of the heart
are a strange thing.

671
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,208
I don't believe in people
being too confident.

672
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,625
Stendhal was right.

673
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,166
Impotent.

674
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,000
He too was impotent.

675
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,750
Im… po… tent.

676
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,625
Oh, I could die!

677
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,875
It's not a question of dying, my dear.

678
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,416
Relax.

679
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,541
Being in such a state of anguish
is inhuman.

680
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,375
Male vanity is unfathomable.

681
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,166
We are not in a stadium.

682
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,916
No one is competing.

683
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,875
I'm not looking for you to beat
some kind of record.

684
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:49,125
I just want you. That's all.

685
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,291
Do you understand?

686
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:59,375
This is just beginning for you and me.

687
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,500
-You know--
-Listen, Sylvain.

688
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,916
We are past domestic disputes.

689
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,625
You don't need to make up excuses.

690
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,916
Whatever you have to say
doesn't interest me,

691
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,875
and I probably already know, anyway.

692
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,000
I'd had a lot to drink.

693
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,666
I believe I was very drunk.

694
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,708
Sandra again.
Her perseverance is admirable.

695
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,416
Maybe you shouldn't be the one
asking me to explain myself.

696
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,666
Go ahead and complain.
You didn't have such a lonely dinner.

697
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,375
You make a funny hermit.

698
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,250
You're the one who didn't show up,
let's not reverse roles.

699
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,041
Excuse me, but I have to work.

700
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:27,750
Always dealing with problems!

701
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,666
You poor thing.

702
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,291
This isn't chance, it's a miracle.

703
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,583
You exaggerate.

704
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,708
Not at all,
I never come to this part of the forest.

705
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:24,208
And then today, for a timber issue.

706
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,541
I understand nothing about what you do.

707
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,583
After everything I talked about yesterday?

708
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,291
I knew I was chatty,
but not to that extent.

709
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,416
You look exhausted, I'll take you home.

710
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,541
No. But I'd like
to go for a ride with you.

711
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,666
Why don't you take me to see your timber?

712
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:46,916
-Don't tell me you're interested in that?
-No.

713
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,750
-But I'd like to know who you are.
-If I only knew.

714
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,750
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, madam.

715
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,916
-I was passing by.
-I was mediating.

716
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,791
Was it gloomy mediation?

717
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:24,875
It varies.

718
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,791
Well, I am here.

719
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:32,041
I don't believe my eyes.

720
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,250
I don't understand what's happening to me.

721
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,708
Life has given me almost everything,

722
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,041
glory, power…

723
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,250
but today I'm feeling a kind of…

724
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,375
weariness,

725
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,125
as if everything had started
to feel heavier.

726
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,416
I'm having this realization thanks to you.

727
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:06,041
I wish that were true.

728
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,625
I don't really know who you are,

729
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:11,916
or what you like,

730
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,625
I'm almost scared…

731
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,041
which is something that
has not happened to me in many years.

732
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,125
Me too.

733
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:24,916
I think about you all the time,

734
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:28,041
I try to picture your life at<i> La Saline.</i>

735
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,166
Are you happy?

736
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,500
It's strange, I love him.

737
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:38,125
He loves me, probably.

738
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,041
But we talk less and less.

739
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:47,291
Have you ever been to Deauville
in the middle of winter?

740
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,625
In love too, there's a dead season.

741
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,125
It comes after the follies of summer.

742
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:01,041
It's a time when you feel suffocated
by the weight of silly little habits.

743
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,041
If you're able to get past it,
then you're safe.

744
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:08,791
And… were you able to
get past it with Françoise?

745
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,000
I think so, I hope so.

746
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,541
That's not very encouraging.

747
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:16,666
It feels like all that is left
between you is a social façade.

748
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,791
I think we have
something else that is left.

749
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,166
A type of companionship.

750
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:30,083
<i>Here is the continuation of the broadcast</i>
<i>of Cabrol's Chamber Music Festival.</i>

751
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:33,875
<i>Third on the program,</i>
The Wedding Cantata.

752
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,666
<i>When the Lord's hand</i>

753
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,291
<i>Fell on the earth</i>

754
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,166
To<i> punish humans</i>

755
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,291
<i>For centuries of sin</i>
<i>His kindness…</i>

756
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,666
Do you want to keep the radio on
or play a record?

757
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,416
You probably prefer the radio.

758
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,166
I would, if you don't mind.

759
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,250
Alright.

760
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,291
Since you want
to make your bed in the study,

761
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,208
take some sheets
out of the large wardrobe.

762
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,291
<i>The tiger and the tigress</i>

763
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,083
<i>The stag, the lion</i>

764
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,583
<i>The doe</i>

765
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,041
<i>Lived in fear</i>

766
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:17,291
<i>Submissive and listening</i>
<i>To the voice of wisdom</i>

767
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,666
<i>Of the Lord</i>

768
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:24,375
<i>Who gives each one their other half</i>

769
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,666
<i>Oh, great fidelity</i>

770
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,916
<i>What great joy, what great joy</i>

771
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,541
<i>Love without sin</i>
<i>Let us thank the Lord</i>

772
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,791
<i>Fidelity, frivolity</i>

773
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,791
<i>Fidelity, frivolity</i>

774
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:42,041
-<i> The Lord is good</i>
<i>- The Lord is good</i>

775
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,375
Sylvain.

776
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,000
We don't see you anymore.

777
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:10,625
Well, you know, I'm working.

778
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,750
I've introduced
too many characters to my story,

779
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,000
so it's a bit overwhelming.

780
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,250
Well, it's not necessarily
pen in hand that you do your best work.

781
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,666
It seems to me that rituals
are like additions, wouldn't you say?

782
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:29,541
That's true, you need to have
all the numbers in your head first

783
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,875
and also some illusion.

784
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,416
I've never been
capable of writing a single line,

785
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,666
but I've always thought I had the most
wonderful novels in the back of my mind.

786
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,791
You're scaring me.

787
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,250
You know…

788
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,500
I can't write anymore.

789
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,500
I might have guessed.

790
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,750
-It will come back.
-May God hear you.

791
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,875
So, when shall we meet again?

792
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:58,875
Anytime.

793
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:00,791
How does seven o'clock sound?

794
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:06,416
Bye.

795
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:34,875
<i>Poor Sylvain,</i>

796
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,541
<i>he was going through a crisis.</i>

797
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,625
<i>The fragile balance of his life</i>
<i>with Geneviève had been broken.</i>

798
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,791
<i>He was once again enjoying</i>
<i>the pleasures of seduction.</i>

799
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,125
<i>He had called all of my girlfriends</i>

800
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,625
<i>and I had decided</i>
<i>to just smile about it.</i>

801
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,916
<i>I was not worried about</i>
<i>his affair with Françoise.</i>

802
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,250
<i>I knew it was destined to fail,</i>
<i>more or less quickly.</i>

803
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,500
<i>She would recover, but…</i>

804
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,500
<i>Sylvain, however…</i>

805
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:10,166
<i>At that point, I wanted to do</i>
<i>something for him, though…</i>

806
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,041
<i>I didn't know what.</i>

807
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,916
Are you the phoner?

808
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,791
I am.

809
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:33,916
Get in.

810
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:48,500
You think very badly of me.

811
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:51,666
Quite the contrary.

812
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:54,250
In this region, people are afraid of me.

813
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,583
I am taken for

814
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,125
a female Bluebeard.

815
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,416
If women like you existed in life,

816
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,000
I would love to meet them.

817
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,291
But I do exist.

818
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,166
I wonder…

819
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,291
No unnecessary questions.

820
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:46,291
In short, I want to shed light on
what the characters think

821
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,750
within an objective narrative.

822
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,916
Some good old-fashioned introspection.

823
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,041
Not at all! I'm not saying it's true.

824
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,541
I'm saying it's what they think.

825
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,916
After all, they do think, don't they?

826
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,041
Fascinating.

827
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,541
I find it funny
that you're telling me all this.

828
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm not exactly an intellectual.

829
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,000
I don't know,
but I'm interested in what you think.

830
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,833
When someone tells me I'm beautiful,

831
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:17,625
I wonder
what the person wants from me.

832
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,291
And they try to kiss me.

833
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,666
You're beautiful.

834
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:26,666
And here we are.

835
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,125
Well?

836
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,791
Well?

837
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,958
I wonder--

838
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:38,750
Now, now, no unnecessary questions.

839
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,625
We are exploring the ruins
of the ghost of a dream.

840
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,291
Extraordinary, right?

841
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,500
Sinister.

842
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,166
I find it depressing. I don't enjoy it.

843
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,416
Yes, I know, you hate failure, right?

844
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,416
Well, not me!

845
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,208
The breed of men
is divided into two types.

846
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,666
Successful men and passionate men.

847
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,750
Well, I only like the passionate ones!

848
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,750
And to hell with it!

849
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:22,375
The fact that you refuse to find
this gorgeous place impressive

850
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,416
is a sign of
what's going on between us.

851
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,875
Don't be childish, Sylvain.

852
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:29,541
Ledoux is my father, my brother
and my angel.

853
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,875
and he said it, actually.

854
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,166
"The glory that men give

855
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,000
is not equal to the work
that it takes to provide it."

856
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,625
"It is like a shadow,

857
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,875
always shorter or longer than the figure."

858
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,500
Claude Nicolas…

859
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,375
I drink to the memory
of your little tormented soul.

860
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,041
Sylvain, why drink so much?

861
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,291
I drink because I like to.

862
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:56,958
I like to drink because I like company,

863
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:59,791
and I like company because I like to talk,
I just like to talk, got it?

864
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,250
No.

865
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,916
Don't you enjoy my company?

866
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,500
No, no, no, and no. There!

867
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,333
I know what you're trying to do.

868
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,666
You are on the hunt,
you shoot the big game,

869
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,583
you add a trophy to your collection

870
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,583
No, thank you! I will not be stuffed!

871
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,708
<i>You want me to be the favorite</i>
<i>in your harem, is that it?</i>

872
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:23,291
<i>You find me attractive?</i>
<i>Abolish the matriarchy!</i>

873
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,875
I wonder where you get
your hunting instincts.

874
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,916
A nice little male is living a quiet life,
minding his own business…

875
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,666
Well, almost.

876
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:37,291
And then here comes a lady
with a big rifle and… bang!

877
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,541
Bang! Bang!

878
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:39,625
No more little male.

879
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,666
A bedside rug.

880
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm horrible, aren't I?

881
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Horrible.

882
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:00,500
Are you angry with me?

883
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:12,750
Yes, I'm angry.

884
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,166
Sylvain…

885
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,291
Where can you hang around
until 5:00 a.m. in this area?

886
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,041
As if you didn't know who I was with.

887
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,500
Well then, you should be happy.

888
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,750
Happy? What does that even mean?

889
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,666
How can I be happy?

890
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,541
I love you!

891
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,416
I gave up on waiting for you,
I went for a walk alone.

892
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:44,583
Would you still like to ride?

893
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:48,000
Thank you, but I'm tired.
But I still wanted to see you.

894
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:53,875
Will you take me home?

895
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:58,250
If you'd like, we can stop for a moment
on the way.

896
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,875
We lack bravery.

897
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,625
I'm not sure if it's possible, but…

898
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,875
I would like to live

899
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,750
without hypocrisy.

900
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,125
I initially took you for a cynic.

901
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,750
I'm not.

902
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:27,166
The moment I see you,

903
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,000
I wonder when I'm going to see you again.

904
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,166
I'm here.

905
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,791
I'll always be here when you want me to.

906
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:39,416
I feel myself becoming shy,
I'm not used to it.

907
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,958
I know.

908
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:43,666
When I'm close to you,
I am a different man.

909
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,666
I want to resemble your idea of who I am,
but I'm afraid I won't succeed.

910
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:51,750
Forty year-old men have trouble
forgetting about their experience.

911
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,041
Shh… We attract for our soul.

912
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,750
I'm not exactly trying to attract you,

913
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:01,750
but I have never met a girl who
gave me everything you do…

914
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,875
momentum in my heart.

915
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,291
Words ruin everything.

916
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,916
For me, a simple gesture
can replace a sentence.

917
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,625
A hand says everything about a person.

918
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,750
I love your hand.

919
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:24,916
I love you.

920
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,291
I didn't believe in happiness.

921
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,875
I was a man of pleasure.

922
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,125
With you, I'm happy.

923
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:41,750
Don't say anything.

924
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,041
Everything is so fragile.

925
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So…

926
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
are you really cleaning up your act
or just pretending to?

927
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,875
Let's say that I'm changing my life.

928
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,750
We will be seeing less of each other.

929
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,416
You're making a mistake.

930
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,416
Women have no appreciation
for spontaneous sacrifice,

931
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,041
they like it when
you concede after a long battle.

932
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,750
Farewell.

933
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Anyway…

934
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:18,625
You know…

935
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,666
having an affair with a man like you
goes against all my principles.

936
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,250
I am the first one to be surprised.

937
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,000
I don't have affairs.

938
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,250
I'm a sensible girl.

939
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,000
No, not sensible.

940
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,750
Grave.

941
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,958
I've never met a girl like you.

942
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,916
Miss Sandra is on the telephone for you.

943
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,916
I've already told you that I am not here.

944
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yes, sir.

945
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,166
I am not asking you for anything,
you know.

946
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,250
I know.

947
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,958
I am not jealous
and I have no intention of being jealous.

948
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,083
We'll see.

949
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:03,666
I don't understand.

950
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,750
I'm not surprised.

951
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:08,750
Let me explain.

952
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,750
I love you and it seems that
you don't love me.

953
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,541
I'm suspicious of words.

954
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,541
Your entire relationship with Sylvain
is based on an illusion.

955
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,791
I have no illusions about my pleasure.

956
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:22,875
Come on.

957
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,000
you have tried to live outside of time…

958
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,875
away from the world,
in a sort of abstraction

959
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,125
on a false desert island.

960
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:37,041
You left your occupations,
he left his excuses.

961
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,791
It never could have worked.

962
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:44,541
I am not someone who makes sacrifices.

963
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:46,875
I'm not asking you to.

964
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,416
Here comes the writer.

965
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:53,625
He's not a real one.

966
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,291
Yes, he is.

967
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,625
A writer writes.

968
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,625
I used to have a client who was a writer.

969
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,125
Admiral Boudet.

970
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,041
He wrote about naval battles.

971
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,250
He gave me his books.

972
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:13,833
He's feeling down again.
He's like that every day now.

973
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,208
Sure, go ahead and complain.

974
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,791
You know it causes blindness.

975
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,416
Good, I don't like what I'm seeing.

976
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,541
Thanks.

977
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,666
I don't mean you. We are like brothers.

978
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,541
You are the light to my darkness.

979
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,875
You're good at fibbing!

980
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:45,541
We're of similar blood, you and I.

981
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:47,125
Fine, shut up.

982
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,666
I could never be mean to you.

983
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,791
I know.

984
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,000
Of long-distance navigation.

985
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,625
Here we go, we've taken off.

986
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,250
I no longer see the earth.

987
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:27,208
I was wondering
where you were killing your nights.

988
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:30,041
But it doesn't take long
to explore the local dives.

989
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,541
Have you met Ursula?

990
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,458
My companion on The Raft of the Medusa.

991
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,291
-Nice to meet you, Miss.
-Hello.

992
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,125
What are we drinking?

993
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,291
You don't mix drinks.

994
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,041
I am opposed to mixing drinks.

995
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,125
Very wise.

996
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,125
I am a technician.

997
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,083
Artificial paradises of all kinds.

998
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,250
All at your service.

999
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,500
Whenever you'd like.

1000
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,666
Sylvain? You drink too much.

1001
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,916
Okay, okay, you're not the Salvation Army.

1002
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,708
Fine, you asked for it.

1003
01:15:58,791 --> 01:15:59,750
Madam?

1004
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,041
Three Ricards.

1005
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,833
How can I thank you?

1006
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,750
No need. You're a friend, a real one.

1007
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,583
I don't know if I should…
I don't want to offend you.

1008
01:16:34,666 --> 01:16:35,791
I'm not offended,

1009
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:38,791
I never mix work and emotions.

1010
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,625
I have a professional conscience.
Do you understand?

1011
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,125
Not only do I understand,
but I also appreciate that.

1012
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:01,541
Well…

1013
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:03,666
time to go home.

1014
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:07,041
Where is the Pole Star?

1015
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,125
When he wakes up, send him home.

1016
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
Jacques…

1017
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,291
we're going to have to do something,
I can't take it anymore.

1018
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,000
Me too.

1019
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,916
Goodbye.

1020
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,916
Goodbye.

1021
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:34,000
Waterloo, the morning after the battle.

1022
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,208
We didn't fight.

1023
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:39,000
Don't think I've forgotten
a word we said to each other.

1024
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,958
We dabbled in Corneille,

1025
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:44,375
nobility, incomprehension…

1026
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
We had plenty to say.

1027
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:50,750
From the moment
you started with new logic, well…

1028
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,458
Oh, I did the new vocabulary trick?

1029
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,541
All of it.

1030
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,000
"A map is not territory."

1031
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,916
"A word is not what names things."

1032
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:02,125
I must have had a lot to drink.

1033
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:04,791
And I said…

1034
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:09,250
Well, once you started with new logic,
I was completely lost.

1035
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,416
I went into automatic pilot.

1036
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:19,500
Maybe I should let Geneviève know.

1037
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,416
She knows, she called.

1038
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,166
-Oh, she did?
-Yes.

1039
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
You know…

1040
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,541
I don't really know what I want to do.

1041
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,750
I'm completely in the dark.

1042
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:40,375
As if I had crossed
the River Styx to the other side,

1043
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,541
no more contact with the living.

1044
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:49,666
Nobody's experience
won't help anybody.

1045
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,125
I am not giving you advice.

1046
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,625
You know, I've got an idea.

1047
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,666
In the state you're in,

1048
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,791
you'll never manage to finish your book.

1049
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,125
You mean, to start it.

1050
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,625
You should have done
something completely different.

1051
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,500
-I don't know, work.
-I don't think so.

1052
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,250
What would I do?

1053
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,166
You could work with me.

1054
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:21,875
If you'd like.

1055
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:23,791
Doing what?

1056
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,166
Anything, really.
the business, the elections,

1057
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,750
you could change the local newspaper
to your liking.

1058
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,000
You can't be serious!

1059
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,833
I am.

1060
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Listen, Jacques,

1061
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,333
I appreciate what you're proposing,

1062
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:40,708
and your state of mind,

1063
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,791
but it's out of the question.

1064
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:43,958
And why is that?

1065
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:48,541
There's no reason for something
you find boring, even revolting

1066
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,083
to all of a sudden amuse me.

1067
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:52,166
Especially in the state I'm in.

1068
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,250
Maybe not.

1069
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,375
I'm sure of it.

1070
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,166
Alright, old man, I'm off.

1071
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,666
-I'll see you soon?
-Of course.

1072
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,541
-Sylvain?
-Yeah?

1073
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,125
I don't think I find it revolting.

1074
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,666
Well then, think about it.

1075
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,916
-See ya.
-Bye.

1076
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,541
You're not ready yet?
You know that the council meets at 11:00.

1077
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,791
We need to talk to Dupont-Turier
before the session.

1078
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:26,583
His vote can change everything.

1079
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:27,750
Did you hear me?

1080
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:30,666
I don't care about Dupont-Turier.

1081
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,333
-Are you crazy?
-No, I'm not crazy.

1082
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:36,666
I feel like I'm seeing things
in a completely new light.

1083
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:40,375
I'm not the least bit interested in
Dupont-Turier's invitation to tender.

1084
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:44,083
The roads, the timber,
the wines, the clock, the newspaper

1085
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:47,333
or who will be at the council meeting
for this sad country district,

1086
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:48,500
I truly do not care.

1087
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,375
I used to be interested in…

1088
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,875
Easter Island, Nepalese temples,

1089
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:58,000
and others.

1090
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:02,916
I never should have stopped
ethnography or archeology, never.

1091
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Goodness.

1092
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:08,041
-But we have responsibilities.
-No, don't worry about that.

1093
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,750
I'll meet with Dupont-Turier.

1094
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,083
Of course I'll talk to him
and let him know discretely

1095
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:15,041
that he'll get his piece of the pie.

1096
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:17,625
Of course I'm going to do it.

1097
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,166
But for once,
I'll see things as they really are.

1098
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,458
Forgive me for saying this,
but I am fed up with all of this…

1099
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:25,541
completely!

1100
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,750
Did you come to see me?

1101
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,500
I want to see you every single minute.

1102
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,916
I think of you
every minute of every day, but…

1103
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,750
I came to see Sylvain.

1104
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,500
To take a big leap?

1105
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,875
Not exactly, it's not…

1106
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:18,416
This is new, we're processing it all.
I just wanted to talk to him.

1107
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,625
He's on the terrace.

1108
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,458
You're good for him,

1109
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,250
you're the only one he can still stand.

1110
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,041
So, not too hot?

1111
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,666
No, not at all.

1112
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,125
Women only find me attractive
when I am tanned.

1113
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,666
I wanted to talk.

1114
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,291
Oh, is it serious?

1115
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,291
Yes, quite.

1116
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:03,708
I will only see
the Minister of Public Distractions.

1117
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:06,041
An organization of saturnalia, you see?

1118
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,250
Right, the dream.

1119
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,625
Joking aside, we should talk calmly.

1120
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,416
This seems to be important to you.

1121
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,375
Alright, let's talk.

1122
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:20,125
Geneviève?

1123
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,666
Of course it's Geneviève.

1124
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:28,625
So we gave up Corneille for Racine?

1125
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,625
Do you think we're getting a better deal?

1126
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,750
I really would like to know
what you think.

1127
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,916
I'm not sure I want to be honest.

1128
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:45,500
Not with myself,

1129
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,916
not with you.

1130
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,916
Saying you're not going to be frank
is already a form of honestly.

1131
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:54,875
Look…

1132
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,541
you love her,

1133
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:00,291
you're unsure she loves you,
you don't think she loves me.

1134
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:01,458
One solution.

1135
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,375
Leave with her.

1136
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,791
Of course, you're having all kinds
of qualms because of me,

1137
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,125
there's no need.

1138
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,125
At this point…

1139
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,125
I don't know if I want
to continue living with her.

1140
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:18,291
or leave her.

1141
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,625
I am sure you still love her.

1142
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,500
She's what counts, right?

1143
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:25,750
Yes, you're right.

1144
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:29,250
I have an idea, actually.

1145
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,666
A diabolical one.

1146
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,041
You can leave with her on one condition

1147
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:39,833
and I'm almost certain
that you won't be able to meet it.

1148
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:41,666
I won't tell you what I wish for.

1149
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,500
Go ahead.

1150
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:48,625
You have to give up
all your bullshit politics.

1151
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,250
You will never be able to do it.

1152
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,000
-I think I will.
-I don't.

1153
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:05,625
You are 39 years old,
we have been married for ten years.

1154
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:07,916
We have two children.

1155
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:11,625
You were the country's youngest minister.

1156
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,916
You still have
your entire career in front of you.

1157
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:23,250
I suppose you know what you are doing.

1158
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,750
Yes, I do.

1159
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,041
I'm not an impulsive man.

1160
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:37,791
So, it's very simple.

1161
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:40,791
Once I resign, midterms will take place.

1162
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,000
Our list will get through.

1163
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:48,166
Don't put yourself first on the ballot,
but rather second.

1164
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,125
There is no risk, and that way,
you'll cater to male vanity.

1165
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:57,625
For the estate, the notary
will take care of everything.

1166
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,750
Including the transfer of shares.

1167
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,875
Right, Mr. Chantavoine
will draw up the paperwork.

1168
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,791
And…

1169
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,791
you know as much as I do.

1170
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,500
I wasn't thinking about all of that.

1171
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,791
You don't live with a person for ten years

1172
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,166
and imagine knowing them.

1173
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,750
I didn't think you were capable
of making this kind of decision.

1174
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,500
Don't tell me you like it?

1175
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:37,416
In a way…

1176
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:39,125
yes.

1177
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:40,666
I recognize you.

1178
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,375
You know, deep down…

1179
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,375
I never really wanted to do this job.

1180
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,916
So we find out afterwards.

1181
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,291
Just a few weeks ago,

1182
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,250
you still somewhat liked your life.

1183
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,041
I don't think so.

1184
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,625
We lived in a kind of a…

1185
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:05,125
network of habits.

1186
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,041
We hardly ever saw each other.

1187
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:12,000
All that was left was a front.

1188
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:13,750
It wasn't so bad.

1189
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:17,666
It's mostly starry-eyed girls
who suffer heartbreak.

1190
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:20,208
And who write
to the newspaper advice column.

1191
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:22,333
No contempt for the people, comrade.

1192
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:24,250
Don't talk about the people

1193
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,500
and imbeciles.

1194
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,500
Don't be a demagogue.

1195
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,250
Especially not now.

1196
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,416
It works when you're in power.

1197
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,375
This is a model break up.

1198
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,916
Strange that we still
understand each other implicitly.

1199
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:44,625
You're figuring it out a little late.

1200
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:51,750
You have meant a lot to me.

1201
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,750
You too.

1202
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,500
Let's stay friends.

1203
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,875
I'd like that.

1204
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,416
But I think I might resent you.

1205
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,625
I'm possessive.

1206
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:26,791
You'll have the power.

1207
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,666
I wasn't talking about that.

1208
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,625
Nevertheless, it's important to you.

1209
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,750
It's actually what we can't have
that we end up regretting.

1210
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:19,000
Put the luggage in the other car.

1211
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:37,416
Are you sure about this?

1212
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,500
Absolutely.

1213
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,375
Then let's go.

1214
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,041
You're thinking about Sylvain.

1215
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:54,250
It would be heinous for me not to.

1216
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,291
Heinous.

1217
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:59,375
You're not jealous?

1218
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:01,875
Never.

1219
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,250
I'm sure this an impulse,
but I'm having trouble believing it.

1220
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,500
You know, I hesitate a lot.

1221
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,875
Was it hard with Françoise?

1222
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:26,625
Not so much.

1223
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:30,375
She has everything now,
since what she really wants is power.

1224
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,625
But power for her is also
possessing you and Sylvain.

1225
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,583
-That may be true.
-She'll get used to it.

1226
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,541
People will think her happy
even though she won't be.

1227
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,250
But you know, what is happiness…

1228
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:45,125
really?

1229
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:52,500
Geneviève.

1230
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:54,208
Yes?

1231
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,750
I don't think we can do this.

1232
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,000
I don't know anymore.

1233
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,041
I do.

1234
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:07,625
It won't work, you still love him.

1235
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,750
And you always will.

1236
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,041
You think so?

1237
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,750
Yes.

1238
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,875
You should both go back to Paris.

1239
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,500
No one can live away from the real world.

1240
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,375
Maybe not.

1241
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,625
You should work.

1242
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,375
And let him run around.

1243
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,291
Why do you care if he stays out…

1244
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:35,750
if he comes home?

1245
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:38,000
He loves you, so…

1246
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,541
But what about you?

1247
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:42,541
Oh, me…

1248
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:44,666
I'll figure it out.

1249
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,375
I'll probably still leave.

1250
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:50,916
You know, these days,
I can't make a decision.

1251
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:55,708
I'm going to walk home,

1252
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,625
I'll take my luggage to the station.

1253
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,041
You're being a true saint.

1254
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:03,541
A secular one.

1255
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:40,125
What about Jacques?

1256
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:42,875
I love him.

1257
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:46,875
And you are here?

1258
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,750
I don't know how to lie.

1259
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,000
Nor how to cheat.

1260
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:57,750
Yet you are lost…

1261
01:32:58,875 --> 01:32:59,916
like me.

1262
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,791
Not lost.

1263
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:07,666
But I think there are
several ways to love.

1264
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,500
Are you trying to tell me

1265
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:13,916
that you still love me?

1266
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:17,666
Not still.

1267
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,041
Always.

1268
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,500
Strangely, I envy him.

1269
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:46,916
You respect him…

1270
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,250
and you're attracted to me.

1271
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:55,041
Maybe you can love two people at once.

1272
01:33:55,916 --> 01:33:57,250
In very different ways.

1273
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,041
Why can't we do things simply?

1274
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:04,416
"Oh, barrel of the Danaid,

1275
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,583
how can one be as happy
as a candid child?"

1276
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:09,333
Sylvain, not this again!

1277
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,750
Enough clowning around.

1278
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,250
I want calm and simplicity.

1279
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:16,666
No more games.

1280
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,541
You're right, I like games.

1281
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:21,500
I'm a child.

1282
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,250
Let's be adults.

1283
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,333
Always play time.

1284
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,416
We must live our lives.

1285
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:30,500
Let's go home.

1286
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,375
You are right.

1287
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,041
But…

1288
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,833
are you absolutely sure about Jacques?

1289
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,333
Yes.

1290
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,125
You know I am.

1291
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,166
Shall I pack our bags?

1292
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:12,916
Come with me.

1293
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:18,666
Hubert, ask Chantavoine to wait.
Have him read the contract.

1294
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,916
-Yes, madam.
-Michele, please bring me the squire.

1295
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,541
And after Melchior,
I'll look at the timber issue.

1296
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:24,750
Very well, madam.

1297
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,000
Mr. Melchior, she will see you now.

1298
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:37,291
Well?

1299
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,833
Congratulations,
are you are taking over the estate?

1300
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:42,625
No, God forbid. It's a mess!

1301
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,958
What makes you think
I'll give up the horses?

1302
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,250
-But, I thought--
-Well, you shouldn't think.

1303
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,541
Draw me up some proposals for expansion.

1304
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Here is our budget.

1305
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:55,291
But, madam--

1306
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:58,250
And please watch over
your daughter's training.

1307
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:01,875
I would like her to win the competition
on my watch.

1308
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:05,250
She has a way of doing things
with elegance and efficiency.

1309
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:06,916
As if she's been doing it for ages.

1310
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,458
I'm surprised she's not resentful.

1311
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,166
Michele, is there anyone left?

1312
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,250
No, madam.

1313
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,166
I want to talk to you.

1314
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,125
I'll make it quick.

1315
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,500
Pack your bags…

1316
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:24,750
you leave at once.

1317
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,500
Here is a year's wages,

1318
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,375
to reward your loyal service.

1319
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:35,750
But madam…

1320
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,916
If you don't have a replacement for me,

1321
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,583
I can stay a few more days.

1322
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:43,750
I have someone.

1323
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:47,541
Your train is at 10:30,
you have plenty of time.

1324
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,291
Yes, sir?

1325
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:32,125
-Is this where I can find Mrs. Symphon?
-Yes.

1326
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,833
-Who should I say is here?
-The new secretary.

1327
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Very well.

1328
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:07,000
You're thinking about Jacques.

1329
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:14,375
It would be heinous for me not to.

1330
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:17,416
Heinous.

1331
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:21,083
He's on your mind too, by the way.

1332
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,125
Of course.

1333
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:27,041
We should never be allowed
to sacrifice another person.

1334
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,750
I'll take him his bags.

1335
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,500
Is he still leaving?

1336
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:30,541
Yes.

1337
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:35,375
You know, changing your life
requires a lot of courage.

1338
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,125
I think that's what he's doing.

1339
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:41,666
I wish it was a little because of me.

1340
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:49,833
Is Françoise taking over the duchy?

1341
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:56,125
Well, I'm off.

1342
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:14,750
Listen, Geneviève.

1343
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,916
Yesterday, you asked me
why things couldn't be simpler.

1344
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:25,916
What if we tried?

1345
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,500
Let's make things simple.

1346
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:35,833
Alright…

1347
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,041
let's take him with us.

1348
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,500
I was hoping you would offer.

1349
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,166
The blind man and the paralytic.

1350
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:15,500
Which can walk and which can see?

1351
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:22,250
-This will get us nowhere.
-And where were we in the first place?

1352
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,291
-You don't want to come?
-I didn't say that.

1353
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:26,750
Well, then stop trying
to say it in the right way.

1354
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,041
Come on.

1355
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:52,916
So…

1356
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,625
what now?

1357
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,125
THE END

1358
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:44,000
