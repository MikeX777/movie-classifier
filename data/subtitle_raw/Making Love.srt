1
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,354
He had this stack
of Gilbert and Sullivan records...

2
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:07,485
that just sat there next to a broken
turntable he never bothered to fix.

3
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,052
He said he didn't have to,
because he could close his eyes...

4
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,228
and hear the entire score
of <i>Pinafore</i> whenever he wanted to.

5
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,398
I told him I could too,
and I didn't have to close my eyes.

6
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,408
That made him smile,
and he put his arm around me...

7
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,104
and we sat there and sang it together.

8
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,170
We slept together the day we met.

9
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,475
Or... maybe it was the day after.

10
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,313
Who remembers?

11
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,051
I remember actually.

12
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:45,029
I held back for a day, because, well...

13
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,464
because I wanted something
to look forward to, I guess.

14
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,025
When I first met him, he was wearing...

15
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,369
a brown corduroy jacket
with elbow patches and wingtip shoes.

16
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,105
God, he really oversold tradition.

17
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,546
About a week later,
I found a package outside my door.

18
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,641
It was a...

19
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,983
first edition of poems by Rupert Brooke.

20
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,489
None of this "Ode on a Grecian Urn"...

21
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,583
"My candle burns at both ends."

22
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,562
This was Rupert Brooke.

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,896
We wanted a baby someday, and I knew
I would have to name him Rupert.

24
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,335
I really had to push myself.

25
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,374
I really did want it
to work though— I think.

26
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,410
I mean...

27
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,313
You know, I've still got that stack
of goddamn Gilbert and Sullivan records.

28
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,087
He's gonna need someone.
I don't think he'll make it alone.

29
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,283
It's good to be alone again.

30
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,849
I can have the whole
bowl of popcorn to myself.

31
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,361
I feel helpless.

32
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,522
I would like to call him.

33
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,535
No more phone calls.

34
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,037
No more excuses.

35
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,106
I'm free.

36
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,440
Damn you, Zack!
Damn all your integrity.

37
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,775
I might call Zack sometime...

38
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,940
and give him back his records.

39
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,214
What do I need with a stack
of Gilbert and Sullivan records?

40
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,712
<i>- He found the key.</i>
- Oh. Good. I hope he likes it.

41
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,808
- Well?
- It's not bad.

42
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,546
- Oh!
- I love it!

43
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,748
- I'll get the papers!
- Wait a minute, Lila. Not so fast.

44
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,257
<i>- Let's go through it.</i>
- Okay. Wow. It's so big.

45
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,692
- You scared me.
- It's beautiful.

46
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,060
It has everything we've been looking for.

47
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,589
And it is so underpriced for today's market.
Don't you think so, Doctor?

48
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,828
Well, talk to my wife, Lila.
She's the big executive.

49
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,035
She makes all the money.

50
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,937
It is a perfect location.
I mean, you have a view from every window.

51
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,567
It is the ideal
young married couple's home.

52
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,271
It's so traditional, but so contemporary.

53
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,371
You've got your
indoor-outdoor feeling...

54
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,780
your quiet, relaxed atmosphere.

55
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,943
I find this room captivating...

56
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,044
particularly the P&G floors.

57
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,351
- P&G floors?
- Peg and groove.

58
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,619
Aha! Oh, great chandelier.

59
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,923
- I know. I know.
- Oh, Claire, I love these beams.

60
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,429
Have you ever seen a house
with a layout like this before?

61
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,897
Really, have you ever seen a house
with a layout like this?

62
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,794
- Oh! Right here. Perfect! The piano.
- Yes.

63
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,893
- Perfect—with the light.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

64
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,170
Okay, where are we gonna put
the couch from New Haven?

65
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,872
Uh, right there.

66
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,375
- Right in that corner.
- Great. And you know what?

67
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,072
- What?
- This wall will be perfect...

68
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,137
for the prints
that we got on our honeymoon.

69
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,445
Yeah!
Wait.

70
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,116
What?

71
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:55,317
What are we doing? You know
how much this place costs?

72
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:57,415
Lila, would you excuse us
for just a minute? Hmm?

73
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,321
- Come with me.
- What?

74
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,122
- This will do it.
- What?

75
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,129
Tada!

76
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,170
You finally found a fireplace
in the bedroom, huh?

77
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,239
These are great tiles. It's everything
we've been talking about. - I know.

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,126
<i>Claire.! The tile.!</i>
<i>Show him the tile in the bathroom.!</i>

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,639
Okay, Zack.
What do you think, really, huh?

80
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,005
- Can we do it?
- No.

81
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,136
- I just don't think we can afford it.
- Oh, look, come on.

82
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,238
You can think of something.

83
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,306
We could economize in other areas.

84
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,820
Look. Who needs three meals a day, right?
And we could walk to work.

85
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,583
I mean, I know we'd have to get up
at 4:00 in the morning...

86
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,147
but just think how thin we'll be.

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,456
Mm.

88
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,793
All right. I know you're right.
We have to be sensible.

89
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,924
Yep.

90
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,269
Damn.

91
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,966
Never find another house
with a fireplace in the bedroom.

92
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,031
Would you settle for an extra blanket...

93
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,771
and an all-night hug?

94
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:57,145
Ohh. You two look
so perfect together in this house.

95
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,049
I just know you'll have
a long, happy life here.

96
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,781
- We can't do it.
- You're a tough act to turn down...

97
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,050
but I'm afraid
you're gonna have to keep looking.

98
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,644
I gotta get back. I have one more patient.
I'll see you later.

99
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:11,688
Bye. I'm sorry.

100
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,700
Why do we always think
it can never happen to us?

101
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,396
Arlene, will you do me a favor?

102
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,531
Will you?

103
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,474
Will you let me
make the diagnosis? Hmm?

104
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,207
You haven't even been biopsied.

105
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,715
Maybe I can join a circus sideshow.

106
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,978
Oh, now, now, now.

107
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,046
Let's get some fresh air.
Come on. I'll walk you to your car.

108
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,688
Okay?

109
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,753
You know, if this happened to Claire...

110
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,595
I think it would
bring us closer than ever.

111
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,760
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

112
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,328
We would know that every time
we made love, I was making love to her...

113
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,397
that her body, no matter what...

114
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,000
was the only body I wanted to hold.

115
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,068
Do you mean that?

116
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,047
Arlene, it may be benign.

117
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,743
But if we have to operate...

118
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,185
I think old Harry is gonna feel more needed
than he's felt in 20 years.

119
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,715
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I really do.

120
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,265
Now I know why women fall in love
with their doctors.

121
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,338
- We're getting the house!
- Zack, really?

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,508
I can't live without P&G floors.

123
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,643
Oh, you!

124
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,812
- You sure? Huh? You sure?
- I'm sure! Mm-hmm.

125
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,322
- Oh!
- Oh, my dears, I'm sorry.

126
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,825
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- Oh! Winnie, it's okay.

127
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,742
No. Come on in.

128
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,783
I only just brought back
the Hemingway for Claire.

129
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:27,030
- Ahh.
- Winnie, Zack said we're getting the house.

130
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,863
- What?
- Zack said we're getting the house!

131
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:34,373
Ohh. Oh, my dear, but that's splendid!

132
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,432
Oh, that's lovely.

133
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,603
<i>- That's wonderful.</i>
- Winnie.

134
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,307
Winnie, we will still
be over for dinner every Tuesday.

135
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,815
Yes, of course.
It was foolish of me...

136
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,853
to think that you'd stay here forever.

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,048
I suppose I got used to you living upstairs.

138
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:55,651
Hmm. Well, I hope you realize...

139
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,892
that you're going to miss some of my stories
about Lawrence Hayden-Ford...

140
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,403
the one Romantic poet
that Rupert Brooke held in high esteem.

141
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,962
Oh, Winnie, then you must sit down
and tell us one right now.

142
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,136
And spoil that delicious anticipation?

143
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,044
No.

144
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,606
Well, I suppose it was time...

145
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,278
for a new coat of paint.

146
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,855
Remember.

147
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,121
There's great fortitude
in these old walls.

148
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,320
Right?

149
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,535
Well, we—we could ask her
to move in with us.

150
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,655
Oh, sweetheart.

151
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,896
Yeah. There's that extra
little room right on the side.

152
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:47,769
No, I love her too.

153
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,314
But that room is for Rupert.

154
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:58,014
- Since we're getting the house—
- Uh-huh.

155
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,081
- What do you think—
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,184
Mm-hmm?

157
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,695
- Mm.
- Mmm. Did you just have a cookie?

158
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,096
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm!

159
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,716
You awake?

160
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,417
Yeah.

161
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,119
Can we buy a new house every week?

162
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,460
Zack, what is it?

163
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,995
Nothing.

164
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,868
One of my patients.

165
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,981
All right. Clear back. Switch.

166
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,849
All right!

167
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,162
- Get in!
- Ah!

168
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,702
All right!

169
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,364
<i>Take that, Zack.! Drive 'em.!</i>

170
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,976
Hey! Over here!

171
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,103
<i>Good shot.</i>

172
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,608
- Hey, Ben.
- Mm-hmm?

173
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,844
I was talking to Alan Baker the other day.
You'll never guess who he ran into.

174
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,487
- Who?
- Maxine DeMarco.

175
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,821
She used to drive up from Bridgeport
every weekend, take on the whole dorm.

176
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,733
Ah, but she made these
great oatmeal cookies.

177
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:44,743
Yeah, Charlie. What'd we call her?
Betty Crocker!

178
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,497
What's the difference? A meal's a meal.

179
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,557
Geez. Nobody grows up anymore.

180
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,660
It's a lost art, Charlie.

181
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,365
- Your game was a little off tonight.
- Yeah, I know.

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,465
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,533
I'm just wiped out, that's all.

184
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,636
We just moved
into the new house this week.

185
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,740
- Man, the giris are waiting for us.
- All right! I'm coming!

186
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,796
Hey. I like these guys.

187
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,424
- Hi.
- Are you next?

188
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,132
I'm gonna get up on that stage
and I'm gonna sing my heart out.

189
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,167
And they're gonna like
me, I just know they are.

190
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,074
All right.

191
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,703
- I hope they do.
- That's the spirit, kid. Get right up there.

192
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,710
And now our final contestant—
from Chatsworth.

193
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,052
<i>All right.!</i>

194
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,316
Let's have a big hand
for Lucie Lee Prescott!

195
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,860
<i>Okay. Good luck.!</i>

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,508
? It's easier to sing a sad song ?

197
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,811
? Than it is to just walk away ?

198
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,977
<i>Take a walk.!</i>

199
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,457
<i>- Get off!</i>
<i>- Get off, honey.!</i>

200
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,799
- She's hopeless.
- She's trying.

201
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,637
<i>Go home.!</i>

202
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,875
<i>Aw. Well, well, well.</i>

203
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,418
<i>It ain't hard to guess</i>
<i>who's gonna be taking home...</i>

204
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
that booby prize tonight, is it, folks?

205
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,716
But you keep practicing, honey,
and come back real soon.

206
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,353
- We can do worse than that.
<i>- Let's award the first prize</i>...

207
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,296
- Oh! Wait a minute!
- Oh, no! No, no, no!

208
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,782
No, no.

209
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,663
<i>Warm up your hands. Get
ready for these folks.</i>

210
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,896
<i>Now, where's</i>—
<i>Oh, now, what's going on here, folks?</i>

211
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,735
- We want to enter the contest.
- Well, what can I call you?

212
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,832
- Uh, Captain.
- And Buttercup.

213
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,140
All right, folks. Looks like we got
one more final contestant here...

214
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,512
so let's really hear it now
for the Captain and li'I Buttercup.

215
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,677
- What do you wanna do?
- <i>Pinafore.</i>

216
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,081
Ahhh.

217
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,322
Very good. Very good.

218
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,230
<i>Oh, no.!</i>

219
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,363
- Get 'em off!
- Come on!

220
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,031
Shit.

221
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,541
They don't like us any better.

222
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:31,055
Well, it looks like Lucie Lee ain't gonna be
taking home that booby prize after all.

223
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,119
<i>More left hand, Zack.! More left</i>...

224
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,663
??

225
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,573
<i>Hi, Mag. 271.</i>

226
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,619
- Where is the bathroom?
- That way. The room with the toilet in it.

227
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,780
I keep forgetting. Of course!

228
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,982
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Yeah.

229
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,083
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,754
You got four calls from Arlene Powers.

231
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,627
- Huh?
- Who's Arlene Powers?

232
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,724
Oh.

233
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,395
She's the woman that had the mastectomy.

234
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,032
Four?

235
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,539
Arlene? Dr. Elliot.

236
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,181
Arlene. Arlene, settle down.

237
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,482
Stay right there.
I'll be over in 10 minutes.

238
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,813
Damn it!

239
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,791
Her husband left her.

240
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,763
That night in bed, he stayed so close
to the edge, I thought he was gonna fall off.

241
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,063
I must've lost my knack, huh?

242
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,364
<i>Huh, Doc?</i>

243
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,532
What do you think?

244
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,441
You think I lost my knack?
You think that's what did it?

245
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,810
What do you think? Oh, shut up!
I don't need your false comfort!

246
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,083
<i>Why didn't you level with
me in the first place?</i>

247
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,284
<i>Why did you get my hopes up?</i>

248
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,723
Damn!

249
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,599
- Howdy. Where you headed?
- I'm on my way home.

250
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,663
Wanna stop by for a drink?

251
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,668
Hop in.

252
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,540
- Name is Ken.
- Frank.

253
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,676
How you doin'?

254
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,448
I live two blocks from here.

255
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,021
Hey. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Uh...

256
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,757
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,030
- I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

258
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,038
Okay. Some other time, huh?

259
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,167
Catch you around.

260
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,274
Mm.

261
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,478
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,027
<i>"Don't look at me like that, darling."</i>

263
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,435
Darling, don't look at me like that.

264
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,530
- Close.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,632
"Why didn't you tell me?"

266
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,837
- Why didn't you tell me?
<i>- "If it had to be one of us</i>...

267
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,513
<i>- If it had to happen to one of us</i>—
- "Why'd it have to be you?"

268
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:52,828
<i>- Why did it have to be you?</i>
<i>- "Did</i> it have to be you."

269
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:54,377
Ohhh.

270
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,478
<i>"It was nobody's fault but my own."</i>

271
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,546
It was nobody's fault but my own.

272
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:01,319
"I was looking up."

273
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,384
I was looking up.

274
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,475
"It was the nearest"...

275
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:06,356
"It was the closest—
nearest thing to heaven."

276
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,757
It was the nearest thing to heaven.

277
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,566
- "You were there."
- You were there.

278
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,662
- Oh, darling.
<i>- "Don't</i>— <i>Don't worry, darling."</i>

279
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,729
Don't— Don't worry, darling.

280
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,401
- If you can paint—
- "If you can paint...

281
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,502
- I can walk."
- I can walk.

282
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,013
- Anything—
- "Anything's possible, don't you think so?"

283
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,742
- Yes, darling.
- "Yes, darling."

284
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,512
<i>- "Yes, yes."</i>
- Yes, yes.

285
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>I love that movie.</i>

286
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,752
Mm.

287
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,900
<i>The great love of my life</i>
<i>was Melanie Franklin.</i>

288
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,701
<i>She was the only other person I know who</i>
<i>could sit through six movies in one day.</i>

289
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:52,402
We would start about 2:00 in the afternoon
and go through the night.

290
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,778
I wanted to marry her.

291
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,316
She wanted to go to grad school.

292
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,713
<i>I could never understand</i>
<i>why she picked school over me.</i>

293
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,054
<i>Well, I mean, now I can, I suppose, but</i>...

294
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,856
<i>Anyway, it took me a while to get over it.</i>

295
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,291
<i>I still haven't found anyone like her,</i>
<i>even with all the movie freaks around.</i>

296
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,603
<i>You know, I sometimes wonder</i>
<i>what my life would be like today...</i>

297
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,112
<i>if she had said yes.</i>

298
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,781
<i>Oh, what the hell.</i>
<i>Why wonder? I'm happy.</i>

299
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,448
<i>There's a lot to be said for being single.</i>

300
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,503
Hey, Danny. Hey, Danny!

301
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,439
- Did you get that part?
- Oh, they tell me Tuesday.

302
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,499
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

303
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,637
Hey.

304
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,978
- Hey! I thought you were gonna call.
- It's been a rough week.

305
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,484
- Next week, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

306
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,446
- Hey, Michael. How you doing?
- Hi.

307
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,753
Can I have a light beer, Pete?

308
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,020
Tsk. I'm doing lousy.

309
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,119
What's the matter?

310
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,256
See that number in the corner
over there— in the red?

311
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,325
I've been cruising him for about an hour,
and he won't even look at me.

312
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,701
<i>Hey, what are you wasting</i>
<i>your time on that guy for?</i>

313
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:31,640
<i>Hey, Michael, you look great.</i>
<i>You gotta move around though.</i>

314
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,735
So, get going.

315
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,987
Bart, you're still coming
to the party on the 15th, right?

316
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,115
- Right.
- Okay.

317
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,826
- What's going on?
- Not much.

318
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,071
- My name's Bart.
- I'm Timmy.

319
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,276
- How come you won't spend the night?
- Maybe next time.

320
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,116
What kind of stuff do you write?

321
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,882
I don't know.
All different kinds of stuff.

322
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:54,356
- Anything I've heard of?
- Probably not.

323
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,628
You know what I could go for right now?

324
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,030
A big fat hamburger with chili sauce.

325
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,797
- You wanna go get one?
- You're crazy.

326
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,031
<i>You know what time it is?</i>

327
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,098
Can we get together again?

328
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,370
Why not?

329
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,507
Let me give you my number.

330
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,088
Will you call?

331
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,821
Sure.

332
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,319
<i>There was this guy</i>
<i>at Columbia</i>— <i>the college, not the studio.</i>

333
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:07,125
<i>And he was something</i>
<i>of a legend with women.</i>

334
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,599
<i>And he used to score</i>
<i>five nights out of the week...</i>

335
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:13,296
<i>with the most beautiful coeds on campus.</i>

336
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,362
<i>A different one every night.</i>

337
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,509
Mm.

338
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:27,039
<i>The only thing was,</i>
<i>he wasn't particularly good-looking.</i>

339
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,646
<i>And, uh, I know he wasn't rich.</i>

340
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,658
<i>And word had it</i>
<i>that he was even a little, uh...</i>

341
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,752
<i>shall we say, "short-changed"?</i>

342
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,568
<i>When will you be back?</i>

343
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,635
<i>I don't know.</i>

344
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,207
Maybe never.

345
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,715
Tell me about the Raintree.

346
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,984
- Where did you hear about that?
- You think you'll ever find it?

347
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,753
<i>You don't think it's a joke?</i>

348
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,261
<i>Well, then finally one day...</i>

349
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,594
<i>someone went up to him and asked him</i>
<i>how he got away with it.</i>

350
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,193
<i>I mean, what he had that</i>
<i>no one else seemed to have.</i>

351
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,761
And he looked him right in the eye...

352
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,274
and he said, very proudly...

353
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,637
"Imagination."

354
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,681
Ah. Mr. McGuire. I'm Dr. Elliot.
What can I do for you?

355
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:39,018
- Where's Dr. Bloom?
- He's on vacation. I'm covering for him.

356
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,285
That's funny.
They didn't tell me that when I called.

357
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,021
Well, we like surprises, Mr. McGuire.

358
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,290
What's with this "Mr. McGuire"?

359
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,026
- How old are you anyway?
- I'm 30.

360
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,728
- A 30-year-old doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,964
Ah. Dr. Jekyll or Dr. Dolittle.

362
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:56,734
Now, those guys were doctors.

363
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,799
So, what can we do for you today?

364
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,902
Oh. I'm just here
for a little checkup.

365
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,437
Ah. Well, come on around the table.
Just sit here on the end.

366
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,608
You can leave your jacket right here.

367
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,912
Well, it says here on your chart...

368
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,423
you just had a complete physical
four months ago.

369
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,482
I like to be on the safe side.

370
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,620
Ah. Well, has anything changed
since you were here last?

371
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,926
Any new symptoms that I should know about?

372
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,229
No. Matter of fact,
I feel pretty good.

373
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,292
Okay. Well, we'll just take a look.

374
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,463
Careful, McGuire. That is not a toy.

375
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,501
Hey, Doc. I can't hear anything.

376
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,038
Maybe they're right.
Maybe I don't have a heart.

377
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,679
- Doctors— they bring out the best in me.
- Yeah, I can see that.

378
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,986
Would you turn to the right, please?

379
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,516
Okay. Very good.

380
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,688
And to the left.

381
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,990
That's fine.

382
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,531
Now, look straight ahead.

383
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,630
Just, uh, pick a spot on the wall...

384
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,141
and don't look directly
at the light, okay?

385
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,200
Straight ahead now.

386
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,712
I read your first book.

387
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,774
Straight ahead<i>. Final Reunion.</i>That was
your first book, wasn't it? - That's right.

388
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:17,514
- Good tough writing.
- Thanks, Doc.

389
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:20,557
I've been meaning to read the others.
Open up now.

390
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,650
And give me an "Ahhh."

391
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,287
- Ahhh.
- Thank you.

392
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,523
Okay. Roll up this sleeve.

393
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,091
- What for?
- I'm just gonna take your blood pressure.

394
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,534
Really, I feel pretty good, Doc.

395
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,700
- I swim about a mile every day.
- Oh, yeah?

396
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,404
Take lots of vitamins,
don't eat any fried foods.

397
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,709
Look at that stomach.
Hard as a rock.

398
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,911
- That's great. You do any drugs?
- Why, you got any to sell?

399
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,045
Very funny.

400
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,090
Actually, I'm very conscious
about not fucking up my system.

401
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:57,059
I'll smoke a little dope once in a while.

402
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,441
Maybe a line or two of coke.

403
00:29:58,476 --> 00:29:59,755
Maybe a line or two of coke.

404
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,390
A Quaalude or two now and then.

405
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,491
Maybe a Percodan once in a while.

406
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,866
A little acid.

407
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:10,964
But if you mean am I <i>into</i> drugs, no way.

408
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:15,072
Okay. You can roll
the sleeve down now.

409
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,338
- Hey, Doc.
- Mm-hmm?

410
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:21,095
As long as I'm here, could you
take a look at something over here?

411
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:24,576
- Sure.
- This is something I saw the other night.

412
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:27,089
Uh, it's sorta swollen up,
and it hasn't gone away.

413
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:29,557
- See that right there?
- Yep.

414
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,527
- It's a tumor, isn't it?
- No. It's not a tumor.

415
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,224
- Lymph node?
- An ingrown hair.

416
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:37,289
Are you sure it's not a tumor, Doc?

417
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,734
Well, if you'd like, I could call in
Dr. Dolittle for a second opinion.

418
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:43,204
You mean it can just swell up like that?

419
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,366
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

420
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,104
Go home and write.

421
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:50,738
Great. No more anxiety.

422
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:53,248
How am I supposed
to get through the rest of the day?

423
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:56,717
- Just have a long lunch.
- Who eats lunch?

424
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:59,381
Well, I do,
and I'd like to get out of here.

425
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,649
As a matter of fact,
I am feeling kinda hungry.

426
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:10,259
<i>- You from New York?</i>
<i>- Queens.</i>

427
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,598
<i>That's where people from the Bronx go</i>
<i>when they wanna move to the country.</i>

428
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,661
<i>How long you been out here?</i>

429
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:18,173
I came out after I graduated Columbia.

430
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:21,574
I figured as long as I had to suffer,
I might as well get a tan.

431
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,905
The bun's not gonna kill you, you know.

432
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,610
- White flour— poison.
- Mm.

433
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:32,143
It's not white flour.
Seven-grain stone-ground wheat.

434
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:35,020
Gimme a break, Doc.

435
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,993
If I say this is poison, this is poison.

436
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,020
You see a shrink?

437
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:43,931
- What is that, a question or a suggestion?
- Mm.

438
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,528
So, tell me about you and your wife.
How long you been married?

439
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:53,001
- Eight years.
- Got any kids?

440
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,204
- No, not yet.
- That's a long time to wait.

441
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,715
Well, we—we wanted
to get our careers going first.

442
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:02,183
What about you?
You, uh—You see anyone?

443
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,550
Sure. I see a lot of people.

444
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:08,451
- Eight years, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,725
Hmm.

446
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:15,959
The money for these cookies
will help send needy children to camp.

447
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:19,058
Please help us out.
Please, friends.

448
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,570
<i>Hey.! What's the matter</i>
<i>with you people?</i>

449
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,698
Can't you see this poor girl
is asking for your help?

450
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,800
Are you gonna let her down?

451
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:29,072
Is that the American way?

452
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:31,478
Come on. Dig into those pockets!

453
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:34,984
Send these kids to camp!
Send this girl here home with a smile!

454
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,679
<i>Come on.! Fork it over.!</i>

455
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:42,487
<i>Thanks a lot, big shot.</i>
<i>You just lost me two customers.</i>

456
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,494
<i>Why don't you stick around?</i>
<i>Maybe you'll scare off the rest of the city.</i>

457
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,926
Hey. Come on in here.
I wanna show you something.

458
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,160
- I can't. I gotta be downtown
at the clinic by 2:00.

459
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:52,867
Aw, come on.

460
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,234
This will only take a second.
Come on.

461
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,007
You know, I really didn't
mean for you to buy that.

462
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:20,158
Sure, you did.

463
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:24,398
Tell me, how much of this do you get?

464
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:27,095
I just spent it on the burger back there.

465
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,604
Hey, you want me to write something in it?

466
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:32,801
Someday. I enjoyed the lunch.

467
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,070
Sure thing, Doc.

468
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,138
<i>When I was in the fifth grade...</i>

469
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:42,481
<i>I had this gorgeous teacher,</i>
<i>Mr. Canizarro.</i>

470
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,986
<i>I had an enormous crush on him.</i>

471
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:49,389
And every morning, uh,
I would stand in the same spot...

472
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:53,225
and he would walk by me and say,
"Ready for a happy day, princess?"

473
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,627
<i>I used to dream that when I grew up...</i>

474
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:04,162
<i>we'd get married</i>
<i>and live happily ever after.</i>

475
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:13,249
<i>Valentine's Day, I made this giant heart</i>
<i>out of crepe paper.</i>

476
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,944
<i>And I was about to give it to him...</i>

477
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:20,012
<i>when he announced to the class that...</i>

478
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,524
<i>He was getting married.</i>

479
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,252
<i>I was crushed.</i>

480
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:31,592
<i>I wasn't what you'd call...</i>

481
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,659
<i>an "understanding kid"...</i>

482
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:38,037
<i>where, uh, romance was concerned.</i>

483
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:41,373
Crepe paper is a bitch to tear.

484
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,992
Mm. I'm worried about it, Claire.

485
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:04,227
What are you worried about?
If it doesn't work, we just dump it.

486
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,963
- But let's at least give it a shot.
- Out of the question.

487
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>You're dreaming, honey.</i>
<i>No one's going to watch...</i>

488
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:12,798
a weekly anthology of great American plays,
not on network prime-time.

489
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:14,901
They'd rather watch junk.

490
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:18,004
We can change that.
Look, it's our fault.

491
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:21,141
They want junk because
we've taught them to want junk.

492
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,981
If we give them quality,
if we give them a choice...

493
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,045
<i>and if we present it in the right way...</i>

494
00:35:26,122 --> 00:35:28,147
we can teach them
to want something better.

495
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:31,216
I'm not talking Shakespeare.
I'm just talking quality.

496
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:34,134
Did they watch Olivier and Joanne Woodward
in <i>Come Back, Little Sheba?</i>

497
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:38,032
<i>It was the lowest-rated program of the week.</i>
<i>I don't think it did a 15 share.</i>

498
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:40,535
Well, it was on New Year's Eve,
wasn't it, Marty?

499
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,401
Now, what about <i>Playhouse 90?</i>

500
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:47,842
Mm.

501
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,607
Don't you have any respect
for the public mentality?

502
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,672
- Honey, what mentality?
- A flexible one, Donald.

503
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,048
We have the power and
resources to raise it to

504
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:58,346
whatever we want and we're not even trying!

505
00:35:58,421 --> 00:36:00,412
Donald, stop calling me "honey."

506
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,687
I think she belongs back at P.B.S.

507
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,254
No. I don't wanna go back to P.B.S.

508
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:11,300
They don't need me at P.B.S., damn it.

509
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,098
- How'd it go?
- Down the drain.

510
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:21,200
- Harrington called. Says it's important.
- Oh.

511
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:25,543
Yeah. He probably wants another pilot
on sex and corruption among the rich.

512
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,776
Get Zack for me, will you?

513
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:53,733
Wait. Don't tell me.
He's, uh...

514
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,577
not back from lunch yet, not at home...
and not at the clinic.

515
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:07,680
Third time this week.

516
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,873
How ya doin'?

517
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:11,147
- I'm okay.
- You work around here?

518
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,382
No, no.

519
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:18,254
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

520
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,463
Excuse me.

521
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:36,170
I think I left my, uh— my keys in my car.
Excuse me.

522
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,210
Are you okay?

523
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:19,721
Sure. Come on.

524
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,670
- Let's get dressed.
- We've got time.

525
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,751
We're supposed to be there at 8:00.
You know my father if we're not on time.

526
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:26,752
- We'll be on time.
<i>- That's what you always say.</i>

527
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,429
<i>It takes you an hour to get ready,</i>
<i>we're late, and he blames me.</i>

528
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,423
Zack, you wanna tell me what's wrong?

529
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:34,595
There's nothing wrong. I'm just trying
to avoid an unnecessary reprimand.

530
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,003
Oh, come on. Look.
I know your father. He's harmless.

531
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,913
What do you know about my father?
You don't even know your own father.

532
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:41,634
- You talk to him twice a year!
- Stop it.

533
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,674
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:49,741
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

535
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,845
<i>Just in a lousy mood,</i>
<i>I guess. I'm sorry.</i>

536
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,288
Are you sure you don't
wanna talk about it?

537
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,022
There's nothing to talk about.
L— Rough day, that's all.

538
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,996
- Okay.
<i>- Come on. Up and at 'em.</i>

539
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,221
Come on.
We gotta go to dinner.

540
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:09,622
- We gotta get some meat on these bones.
- Don't tickle me!

541
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,712
- Don't tickle me!
- Come on! Meat on these bones!

542
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,350
- You're too skinny! We gotta fatten you up!
- It makes me mad!

543
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,835
<i>Well, I'm concentrating</i>
<i>on the Romantic poets...</i>

544
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,938
<i>primarily Shelley.</i>

545
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:21,779
I'm sure you're rereading Virgil,
if only as a foundation.

546
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,479
Actually, I'm using Milton
as a foundation.

547
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:27,717
I think you'll find Milton
used Virgil as a foundation.

548
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,284
Ah. I can see how seriously
you're taking this Ph.D. Business.

549
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,353
I'll have two sons the doctors.

550
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,864
The internist and the externist.

551
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:39,163
So, how is the— the new guy working out?

552
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,226
- Alan Milgrom?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

553
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:43,329
- Oh, he's coming along fine.
<i>- Good.</i>

554
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:45,397
It'll take time, of course.

555
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,807
I, um, had to take him off a case.

556
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:50,010
That's too bad. How come?

557
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:52,143
He made five errors on the
first set of contracts.

558
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:54,206
Dad, the guy's fresh out of law school.

559
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,252
Why don't you just give him a break?

560
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:02,884
What if you had a patient
with, uh, leukemia?

561
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,223
He showed symptoms and you did a...

562
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,320
- What, white-cell count?
<i>- That's right.</i>

563
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:09,763
But your new lab technician misread it.

564
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,857
So that you diagnosed anemia...

565
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:15,199
<i>and your patient died</i>
<i>without receiving treatment.</i>

566
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,330
Would you put the error
down to inexperience...

567
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:20,535
and permit the technician to continue,
possibly misread again?

568
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,737
It's not the same thing.

569
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:25,337
Now you're talking about a human life,
not a contract.

570
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:29,511
Performance is performance. You have to
instill that in the people who work for you.

571
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,985
<i>If you can't, you have no business</i>
<i>assuming responsibility.</i>

572
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,117
Would anyone care for any more meat?

573
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:41,095
- Pam?
- No. Thanks, Christine. I'm fine.

574
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:45,362
I've already put Alan on another job—
newspaper monopoly.

575
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:48,598
Matter of fact, we're flying to Milwaukee
on Saturday for a week.

576
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,935
- This coming Saturday?
- Mm.

577
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:55,205
What about dinner?

578
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:57,377
Dinner?

579
00:41:57,378 --> 00:41:59,698
You're supposed to come see
what we've done to the house.

580
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,679
Oh. I'm sorry, Zack. Well, we'll have to
do that the following week.

581
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:07,184
- Okay.
- Sure.

582
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,901
Bart? Zack Elliot.
How you doing?

583
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,174
I was just calling to, uh...

584
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,546
to find out
if your famous tumor went away.

585
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:39,086
You see?
What did I tell you?

586
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:43,216
Look, I was, uh, wondering if maybe
you wanted to grab some dinner tonight.

587
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:50,097
Great. How about, uh, 8:00
at, uh, La Masia?

588
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,493
I'll see you then.

589
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:15,547
Susan? It's Zack. Hi.

590
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:19,186
Um, is Claire busy? Thanks.

591
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:24,325
Hello.

592
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,391
Great.

593
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:31,196
Oh?

594
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,436
Sure.

595
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,207
Yeah. See you later.

596
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:57,056
Oh, she married some guy
she met in grad school.

597
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:00,159
Well, I really haven't been involved
with anybody since then.

598
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:04,365
Come on.
Come on.

599
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,431
I'm a famous writer, my boy.

600
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,739
I have a reputation to live up to.
That takes time.

601
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:11,041
That takes concentration.

602
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:16,449
No time for frivolous liaisons
or forced encounters.

603
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,749
Sure.

604
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:23,952
What, you can't accept the idea
that someone might wanna be alone?

605
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:27,928
Well, not when you try that hard
to make a case for it, no.

606
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:31,057
Aha. And you have
the consummate marriage.

607
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,761
No. I didn't say that.

608
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:36,270
We've been together eight years.

609
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,967
- So have me and these boots.
- Oh, yeah?

610
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:41,874
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I hope you're very happy together.

611
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:48,981
So, where do you go to meet people?

612
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,519
I don't know. Around.

613
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:54,646
You always wanted to write?

614
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,749
Before I could speak.

615
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,817
I used to write these
amazing short stories...

616
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:02,956
really salacious—
all about adultery and incest.

617
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:05,660
Can you imagine a 10-year-old kid
writing about incest?

618
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:11,295
I used to have the brother and sister
doing it under the lemonade stand.

619
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:15,902
You ever want a family?

620
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:19,846
Not really.

621
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:23,613
I used to.
I had the whole picture.

622
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,120
A big ol' house in the country.

623
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:28,383
Couple of Irish setters.
You know.

624
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,455
It's still possible.
It's not like you're 80 or anything.

625
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,158
Somehow,
I just don't think it's in the cards.

626
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:41,328
I don't know.

627
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:45,100
I, uh— I've been through a lot of changes.

628
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:48,871
<i>- Oh, yeah? What kind of changes?</i>
- You know. Changes.

629
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:52,880
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

630
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:54,882
What are you trying to get at?

631
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,884
<i>What are</i> you <i>trying to get at?</i>

632
00:45:56,952 --> 00:45:58,442
- Me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

633
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,511
- I'm not trying to get at anything.
- Oh, no?

634
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:02,540
You brought it up.

635
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,491
Well, I just meant that
I'm happy, that's all.

636
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,994
- Ah.
- What about you, pal?

637
00:46:07,062 --> 00:46:09,496
- You happy?
- Ahh.

638
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,033
For the most part, yeah.

639
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,092
Oh, yeah?
What about the other part?

640
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:18,935
What are you grinning at?

641
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:22,066
I don't know.

642
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:25,773
I just find a certain charm
in your confusion.

643
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,748
Okay. I've got, uh...

644
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:33,879
I've got a few mysteries.
Big deal. Doesn't everybody?

645
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:36,891
Oh, I love a mystery.

646
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:38,984
So, are you solving them?

647
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:41,461
Do you solve yours?

648
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,926
- I never said I had any.
- No?

649
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:52,168
Okay. I admit it.
I have done some experimenting.

650
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:55,210
- Like what?
- A little bit of everything.

651
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:58,007
- You name it.
- You name it.

652
00:47:00,015 --> 00:47:04,543
Okay. The truth is, I have gotten into
a lot of different scenes.

653
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,283
I'm a writer. I have to open myself up
to new things...

654
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:11,087
expand my horizons.

655
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:16,991
- Bart.
- Zack?

656
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,795
Why don't you just say it?

657
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,864
I'm gay.

658
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,635
Thank you.

659
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:29,371
You're welcome.

660
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:34,781
So, tell me about your mysteries,
my friend.

661
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:38,547
<i>- How much longer are you gonna wait?</i>
- Wait?

662
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,054
Oh, life's too short to play games.

663
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:43,318
What are you talking about?

664
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:45,587
I'm talking about the eyes...

665
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:49,995
<i>the probing, the impulse to have dinner.</i>

666
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:52,499
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>you develop an instinct, Doc.</i>

667
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:56,669
You wanna talk about it?

668
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,744
It's easier when you talk about it.

669
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,548
I know.

670
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:25,031
So, you read any good books lately?

671
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,330
Hey. I'm married, Bart.

672
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:33,368
If it feels good, do it.

673
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:37,944
You don't get any points
for playing by the rules.

674
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:40,072
Look. It's not...

675
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:45,282
It's not as if I'm gay.

676
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:48,016
I mean, I'm— I'm just curious, you know?

677
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:54,226
I'm in love with Claire. I don't know
what kind of a life I could have without her.

678
00:48:54,296 --> 00:48:57,231
I mean, I love her.
I don't wanna be without her.

679
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:04,530
I'll get some more scotch.

680
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:09,374
Physician, heal thyself.

681
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:15,880
<i>Hey.</i>

682
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,251
Are you sure you wanna spoil the mystery?

683
00:50:09,104 --> 00:50:11,163
I'll do that.

684
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:01,909
- How you doin'?
- I'm great.

685
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:04,817
- How you doing?
- I'm great too.

686
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:09,848
I didn't realize how late it was.

687
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:12,758
It's not even midnight.

688
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:15,695
I gotta get up early.

689
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:17,823
Yeah. Me too.

690
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,573
So, how do you like being a doctor?

691
00:52:27,642 --> 00:52:31,544
How do I like being a doctor?

692
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:33,843
Well, after four years of college...

693
00:52:33,915 --> 00:52:37,578
four of med school, a year of internship,
and two of residency...

694
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:41,349
I'd say I've developed a certain degree
of fondness for the profession.

695
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:43,584
Okay. I was just trying
to make conversation.

696
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:46,422
Yeah? Well, don't exert the energy.
You gotta be up early.

697
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:48,588
So what's with all the sarcasm?

698
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:50,688
- Forget it.
<i>- No.</i>

699
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:53,030
Let's talk about it.

700
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:56,127
Okay. I was just expecting
a little more, that's all.

701
00:52:56,204 --> 00:52:58,229
That's always been a problem with me.

702
00:52:58,306 --> 00:53:01,969
Zack, in years to come...

703
00:53:02,044 --> 00:53:05,536
when you talk about this, and you will...

704
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,147
be kind.

705
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,587
I was just trying to make a little joke.

706
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:15,214
- How do I get out of here?
- Where you going, Westwood?

707
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,282
No. That must have been
last night's trick.

708
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:21,692
Hey. Ease up, will ya?

709
00:53:28,737 --> 00:53:32,434
<i>What did he want from me?</i>
<i>What did he want me to be?</i>

710
00:53:32,507 --> 00:53:36,910
<i>Teacher? Tour guide?</i>
<i>Father confessor?</i>

711
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:41,682
<i>Hey. I don't wanna be anyone's teacher.</i>

712
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,947
<i>I guess I shouldn't have encouraged him.</i>

713
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,648
<i>I mean, one night,</i>
<i>the guy's all ready to move in.</i>

714
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:52,253
<i>Hey. I mean, who needs it?</i>

715
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:55,785
<i>You know, I can score five nights</i>
<i>out of the week, no problem.</i>

716
00:53:55,864 --> 00:54:00,096
<i>So it's a different person every night.</i>
<i>So what? I like diversity.</i>

717
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:03,899
<i>I like the challenge, the adventure.</i>

718
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:17,275
I just don't feel like dealing
in anyone else's identity crisis, that's all.

719
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:44,201
I got a question to ask.
I'm only gonna ask you once.

720
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:46,270
- You ready?
- Shoot.

721
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:48,373
- Do you walk in your sleep?
- What?

722
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,441
Walk in your sleep.
Do you sleepwalk?

723
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,919
Does anybody know? Does anybody
get the chance to find out?

724
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,385
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you want from me anyway?

725
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:58,915
There are 40 million guys out there,
and they're all just waiting for you.

726
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:02,862
Oh, that's it, huh? One night per person.
Those are the rules, huh?

727
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:04,922
That's right.
Those are the rules.

728
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,280
Well, to quote the words
of a well-traveled visionary...

729
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:09,327
"You don't get points
for playing by the rules."

730
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:12,498
Oh, boy.
Talk about visionaries.

731
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:16,340
You wanna see something badly enough,
you see it whether it's there or not.

732
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:19,812
You were probably shattered to find out
that the tooth fairy was really your mother.

733
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:26,081
Yes, as a matter of fact, I was.

734
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:33,021
So was I.

735
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:36,530
Let me get back to work, okay?
I'm right in the middle of something.

736
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:38,759
We'll get together
later in the week, all right?

737
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:45,596
<i>Hey, Zack.</i>

738
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,942
How 'bout Friday?

739
00:55:56,384 --> 00:56:00,218
<i>Oh, he was very tall.</i>

740
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:03,917
And his hair was so dark,
it glistened in the sunlight.

741
00:56:05,393 --> 00:56:09,159
And I was playing Viola in <i>Twelfth Night.</i>

742
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:13,895
And one evening, he presented himself
at the dressing room door.

743
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:18,531
Captain, the Honorable
Lawrence Hayden-Ford.

744
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,235
A soldier of the sword...

745
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:23,903
<i>but a slave of the heart.</i>

746
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:27,415
<i>And he said</i>...

747
00:56:27,482 --> 00:56:29,973
<i>Nothing he said that evening...</i>

748
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:35,421
<i>moved me more than the verse</i>
<i>he recited of one ofhis poems.</i>

749
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:40,651
<i>"Farewell, my Dover maiden...</i>

750
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:45,325
<i>"alabaster and lapis lazuli.</i>

751
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,166
<i>"Adieu, channel cliffs of Albion.</i>

752
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:53,571
<i>And my</i> belle dame, avec merci."

753
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:59,539
And you know the rest of the story.

754
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:02,777
Tell it, Winnie.

755
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,252
Château-Thierry.

756
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:11,450
Hmm? And he never came back.

757
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:18,757
<i>But... he never died.</i>

758
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,896
Ah, this is it. Here we are.

759
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:30,536
"Farewell, my Dover maiden,
alabaster and lapis lazuli."

760
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:33,581
- Can you believe that line?
- Oh, come on. Give her a break.

761
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:37,414
- Oh, I mean, it's a great line for her.
- I know that's what you meant.

762
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:40,613
- Did you think I was mocking it?
- No, I didn't think you were mocking it.

763
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:43,569
That's what it sounded like.
If she wants to live in a fantasy worid...

764
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:46,588
- then that's up to her.
- Come on, Zack, relax.

765
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:48,541
I told you I didn't think
you were mocking it.

766
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:49,789
Yes, you did.

767
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:51,957
I didn't.
What is the matter with you?

768
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:55,002
What's with you? Hey, I'm under
a lot of pressure at the office.

769
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,834
<i>Bloom is still on vacation.</i>

770
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,855
- Forget it. Let's just go to bed.
- I don't wanna go to bed.

771
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:05,278
- What do you mean?
- I mean I don't wanna go to bed.

772
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:08,510
Fine, don't go to bed. But don't tell me
how tired you are in the morning.

773
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,450
<i>What's this? Why do you keep buying</i>
<i>toothpaste with stripes?</i>

774
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,454
You know I don't like stripes.
How many times do I have to tell you?

775
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:16,786
I forgot.

776
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:21,852
What is wrong with a simple,
old-fashioned, plain toothpaste? White!

777
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,455
I'll even go blue, as long as it
doesn't have goddamn stripes!

778
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:27,865
Look. Why don't you just do us a favor
and buy your own fucking toothpaste?

779
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:30,666
I will!

780
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,366
- How you doing, Claire?
- Morning.

781
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:38,776
- You look lovely.
- I need some time off, Alex.

782
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:42,376
Personal privilege.

783
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,475
You and Zack?

784
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:46,543
Yeah.

785
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:48,612
Timing's bad.

786
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:53,828
- You've got terrific potential here.
- Oh. Well, look.

787
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:56,557
If I've got it now,
won't I have it in a year?

788
00:58:56,631 --> 00:58:58,963
Year? You know the momentum
of this business.

789
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:00,673
Ayear from now you could walk in and have

790
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:02,554
trouble getting your
parking ticket validated.

791
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:05,534
<i>Sweetie, be rational.</i>

792
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:09,475
- You're the sharpest mind I got right now.
- Oh, Alex, come on.

793
00:59:09,544 --> 00:59:12,144
What are you talking about?
Every time I come up with an idea...

794
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:14,348
that's fresh or unconventional,
I just get shot down.

795
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,884
At least you come up with it.

796
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:20,011
Look. I didn't come here
to express any discontent with my job.

797
00:59:20,077 --> 00:59:22,837
- You want money, more control?
- That's not what I'm talking about.

798
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:25,358
I'm telling you that you can be
a head of the network someday.

799
00:59:25,427 --> 00:59:27,667
God knows you could be sitting
at this chair by August.

800
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:32,726
Alex, I'm almost 30. I'm beginning
to wonder where I'm gonna be when I'm 40.

801
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:35,770
Clock's not gonna stop.

802
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:38,567
I love my work.

803
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,041
But I'm afraid I'm gonna end up going home
to an empty bed in an empty house...

804
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,739
with my pilot scripts and my Betamax
and all my potential.

805
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:54,246
Zack and I have a dream.

806
00:59:54,322 --> 00:59:56,950
I need a year.

807
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,962
I'm gonna make life difficult.

808
01:00:03,963 --> 01:00:05,793
No. Don't say what I
think you're gonna say.

809
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,734
- I'm making you head of Program Development.
- You bastard.

810
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:13,240
<i>I put Marty in charge therejust temporarily</i>
<i>until I could get a replacement for Brinkman.</i>

811
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:17,108
- You're the best man for the job.
- Alex, don't do this to me.

812
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:20,477
<i>Don't make it sound like</i>
<i>I'm sentencing you to Devil's Island.</i>

813
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:24,609
<i>- I'm giving you a shot.</i>
- No, you're taking it away, and you know it.

814
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:27,120
Will you think about it? Please?

815
01:00:28,223 --> 01:00:30,191
<i>Hmm?</i>

816
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:37,924
Why don't you go to New York this weekend?

817
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:40,126
Meet the guys.

818
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:43,693
Talk to Zack.
I'm sure he'll support it.

819
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:49,477
Of course he'll support it.

820
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,516
Claire?

821
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,787
- We gotta talk, Zack.
- What is it? What's wrong?

822
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,693
- We need to talk.
- Okay, okay. Let's go for a walk.

823
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,282
No, I don't wanna go for a walk.
I'm not one of your patients.

824
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,792
- I wanna stay right here.
- All right.

825
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:15,859
What?

826
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:18,564
Harrington made me
head of Program Development.

827
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:22,308
- That's fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

828
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:25,539
Congratulations.

829
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:30,512
What?

830
01:01:30,584 --> 01:01:33,018
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

831
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:37,853
What about Rupert?

832
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:40,826
- Rupert will just have to wait.
- I'm almost 30.

833
01:01:40,895 --> 01:01:43,375
Well, you can't turn this down.
You've worked years for this.

834
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:45,696
You'd hold it against the kid.

835
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:48,098
Would it make it easier for you?

836
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:55,170
Sorry.

837
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:57,904
I just want you to tell me
how you can't wait...

838
01:01:57,978 --> 01:02:00,378
to teach Rupert how to shoot a basket...

839
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,472
or ride a horse...

840
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:06,213
or just walk around on his—
his little legs.

841
01:02:13,727 --> 01:02:16,662
They want me to go to New York
this weekend.

842
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:24,729
<i>Right from the snack bar.</i>

843
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:29,799
- Eat it while it's hot.
- Yeah.

844
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:35,272
You know, you're a hell of a writer.

845
01:02:35,348 --> 01:02:37,873
- You read the book?
- Yeah. It's amazing.

846
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:41,580
You're like two different people.
You got a lot buried in there.

847
01:02:41,654 --> 01:02:44,782
What are you talking about?
It's a work of fiction.

848
01:02:44,857 --> 01:02:48,020
- And none of those people are you, huh?
- Well...

849
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:52,788
Where'd you get your imagination?

850
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,661
You develop it.

851
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:04,099
Oh, yeah?

852
01:03:09,882 --> 01:03:12,248
You didn't play any sports as a kid?

853
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,778
The most active thing I ever did
was jump to conclusions.

854
01:03:16,856 --> 01:03:20,815
Well, I just figured the way you work out,
you know? Swimming.

855
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,590
- I guess I give that impression.
- Yeah, you got the weights and everything.

856
01:03:24,664 --> 01:03:27,132
No, actually, I never did.

857
01:03:29,302 --> 01:03:32,738
- There was Little League.
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>

858
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:35,239
Oh, yeah.

859
01:03:35,308 --> 01:03:38,243
There was Little League, all right.

860
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:40,506
My father was determined
to make a man out of me.

861
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:45,517
<i>God, I fought it all the way.</i>
<i>But on this, he would not budge.</i>

862
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:51,122
I'll never forget the
time he asked the guys

863
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:53,522
to come down from the
office to watch me play.

864
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:56,994
He gave me batting practice for a week.
He said, "Kid, you better not strike out."

865
01:03:58,998 --> 01:04:04,630
<i>The only thing was,</i>
<i>he forgot that I couldn't catch.</i>

866
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:08,105
So there we were,
2- and-2 pitch, bases loaded.

867
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:11,871
Me out in right field,
praying for a strikeout.

868
01:04:11,944 --> 01:04:14,674
When sure enough,
fly ball coming right toward me.

869
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:20,310
<i>I held out</i>
<i>my brand-new Spalding mitt.</i>

870
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:24,482
I got that— that feeling in the pit
of my stomach. You know when...

871
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:28,653
- Yeah.
- I just closed my eyes.

872
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:31,424
It came down about three feet from me.

873
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,568
The old man said he couldn't
go to the office for a week...

874
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:39,104
because he was so ashamed.

875
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,564
Jesus.

876
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,303
The night he died, l...

877
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:52,249
I went into a gay bar for the first time.

878
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:57,449
I didn't do it to—
to celebrate or anything.

879
01:04:59,392 --> 01:05:01,417
I did it 'cause I was pissed.

880
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:05,156
Pissed that I never got
the chance to tell him...

881
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:09,258
that his all-American right fielder
liked to get it on with other right fielders.

882
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:16,240
I really wanted to see
the look in his eyes.

883
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:22,140
God, I wanted that scene.

884
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,644
Hey.

885
01:05:31,924 --> 01:05:33,915
Thanks.

886
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:41,358
Mm. I want you to read
that new outline of mine.

887
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:43,595
Great. I'll—
I'll come by tomorrow.

888
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:45,933
You're not on call tonight, are you?

889
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:49,398
- No.
<i>- Your wife's in New York.</i>

890
01:05:49,475 --> 01:05:53,809
- Mm-hmm.
- So, uh, why don't you stay the night?

891
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:58,477
<i>Hell, why don't you stay</i>
<i>the whole weekend?</i>

892
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:03,979
Great.

893
01:06:25,478 --> 01:06:28,811
Time-out. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
You pay for dinner.

894
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,922
<i>- Coming at you. Look out.</i>
<i>- I got you now.</i>

895
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:49,331
<i>Come on. Look out. Here it comes.</i>

896
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:51,996
- Oh, no!
- Yee-hee-hee!

897
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:55,438
This is it! This is it!

898
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:00,937
Look out now.

899
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:03,481
All right.
Look out! Look out!

900
01:07:03,549 --> 01:07:06,245
<i>Ooh.! All right.!</i>

901
01:07:15,261 --> 01:07:18,526
- So?
- Hang on.

902
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:32,033
I think you can do better.

903
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:34,636
<i>Itjust doesn't have the same honesty</i>
<i>your other work has.</i>

904
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:37,046
- Honesty?
- Yeah, I don't think you believe in it.

905
01:07:37,116 --> 01:07:40,244
It— It reads like you wrote
to get a big movie deal or something.

906
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,981
Oh, Jesus. I don't know why
I let you read it in the first place.

907
01:07:43,055 --> 01:07:45,216
What do you know?
A fucking doctor!

908
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:48,351
If all you wanted was approval, I'm sorry.

909
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:50,418
I thought you wanted an honest opinion.

910
01:07:50,496 --> 01:07:53,260
Honest? Oh, you're a great one
to talk about being honest.

911
01:07:53,332 --> 01:07:56,096
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.

912
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:59,069
No, I wanna know what you mean by that.

913
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:02,596
All right.
What are you doing here?

914
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:04,700
What am I do...

915
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:06,836
You invited me.
I'm here because I wanna be here.

916
01:08:06,912 --> 01:08:10,848
Right, but you're not gay or anything,
are you? You're just curious, right?

917
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,907
Yeah, I'm curious.
So what?

918
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:16,887
Well, I'm getting sick of all this curiosity.
It's so fucking convenient.

919
01:08:16,956 --> 01:08:20,016
What are you talking about?
What, because I didn't like your outline?

920
01:08:20,092 --> 01:08:22,856
I'm just getting sick
of all the games you're playing.

921
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:25,362
I mean, first you're here,
then you're back to your wife.

922
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:28,431
Why don't you just admit it instead of
running away like a fucking coward?

923
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:31,470
Me, the coward?
Me, running away?

924
01:08:31,537 --> 01:08:34,904
I'm not out there every night cruising
bus terminals for a little validation...

925
01:08:34,974 --> 01:08:37,602
and then taking off
before anybody gets too close.

926
01:08:37,677 --> 01:08:41,636
At least I know who I am.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

927
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:44,376
<i>And for your information, wiseass...</i>

928
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,975
I've never cruised
a bus terminal in my life.

929
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:50,013
Hey, sport, have you thought about
what it's gonna be like in 10 years...

930
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,688
when you can't walk into any bar
and grab the first guy you see?

931
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:55,059
Well, by then,
I'd have a great tape collection...

932
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:57,789
and you'll still be solving your mystery.

933
01:08:58,898 --> 01:09:02,265
Okay. Let's just drop it.

934
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,326
Oh, that's great.
That's perfect.

935
01:09:04,403 --> 01:09:07,634
Let's just drop it.
Let's just block it out!

936
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:35,727
I've been there, Zack.

937
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:39,966
It doesn't work.

938
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:42,701
You can talk yourself into it.
You can say, "Okay, I'm curious."

939
01:09:42,775 --> 01:09:45,573
Or "It's just a phase"
or "I'll get over it."

940
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,635
But every time you make love to her...

941
01:09:47,713 --> 01:09:50,513
you're gonna be thinking about the number
you cruised that afternoon.

942
01:09:50,514 --> 01:09:53,712
Bart, I want it.

943
01:09:53,786 --> 01:09:57,278
I want it, but I-I don't want
the one-night stands...

944
01:09:57,356 --> 01:09:59,847
the phony names, going home alone.

945
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:04,475
Things may be shaky
between Claire and me in bed...

946
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:07,398
but at least we're
there for each other in the morning.

947
01:10:07,466 --> 01:10:10,128
Well, what makes you think
you can't have that with another guy?

948
01:10:18,477 --> 01:10:22,243
Zack. Are you awake?

949
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:25,511
Yeah.

950
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:27,882
I'm not gonna submit the outline.

951
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:30,581
You were right.
The idea stinks.

952
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:35,560
- Hey, Bart?
- Hmm.

953
01:10:37,096 --> 01:10:39,087
I love you.

954
01:10:44,837 --> 01:10:46,964
You don't have to say anything.

955
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,211
- Morning.
- Morning. Sleep okay?

956
01:11:02,288 --> 01:11:05,018
- Yeah, great.
- Grab some juice in the refrigerator.

957
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,251
Oh.

958
01:11:07,326 --> 01:11:09,590
Anything in the news?

959
01:11:09,662 --> 01:11:12,859
Oh, you know.

960
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:15,127
What do you wanna
do today? Huh?

961
01:11:15,201 --> 01:11:18,227
I've got this great new idea for a book.
I think I'm gonna write it up.

962
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:22,434
- How long will that take?
- Probably most of the day.

963
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:24,772
Wanna get together for dinner?

964
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:28,143
I'd love to, but I can't.
I made other plans.

965
01:11:28,214 --> 01:11:30,648
I really don't think I can break them.

966
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:34,244
Why don't we get together
later in the week?

967
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,447
Claire's coming back tomorrow.

968
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,722
I'm gonna have that talk with her.

969
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:46,162
Well...

970
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:48,996
that's a step
in the right direction anyway.

971
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:51,059
Here. You want this?

972
01:11:55,574 --> 01:11:59,772
I guess, uh, I'll just take off.

973
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:02,313
Oh, don't forget your records.

974
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:05,646
You keep 'em.
I brought 'em for you.

975
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:10,052
Thanks, but, uh, I'm really not
into Gilbert and Sullivan.

976
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,890
Zack?

977
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:20,491
I really think you're gonna like
that new outline.

978
01:12:32,678 --> 01:12:36,546
We spent the day Saturday
going over the fall schedule.

979
01:12:36,615 --> 01:12:39,209
Of course, my real impact wouldn't
be felt until next year.

980
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:41,981
But I think I could probably
get a few good things going.

981
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:45,174
I mean, for instance, they were nervous
about the interracial marriage pilot.

982
01:12:45,175 --> 01:12:48,959
And they were thinking
about dumping it, so, uh...

983
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:51,724
I suggested that they make the couple
import-export dealers...

984
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:56,530
and that way they could get in
some good international intrigue.

985
01:12:56,602 --> 01:12:59,002
They bought it.

986
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:01,369
You just have to know how to handle them.

987
01:13:17,389 --> 01:13:19,152
All right, look.

988
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:22,716
Uh, we're gonna cut this out,
and we're gonna talk.

989
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:25,855
You cannot do this to me.
It's not fair.

990
01:13:25,931 --> 01:13:30,095
Now, I don't know what to do. I don't know
what to say. I don't know how to hold you.

991
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:32,249
I don't know whether I should
even try to hold you.

992
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,232
<i>God, Zack, we've always</i>
<i>gotten each other through...</i>

993
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:42,269
because we've never been afraid to share.

994
01:13:42,348 --> 01:13:44,441
You've closed yourself off,
and I feel helpless.

995
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:46,950
I don't know what to do.

996
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:50,853
<i>You gotta tell me.</i>
<i>Are you</i>—<i>Are you sick? Are you in trouble?</i>

997
01:13:50,923 --> 01:13:54,859
<i>Look. Whatever it is,</i>
<i>I can handle it.</i>

998
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:57,293
I can handle it no matter what it is.

999
01:13:57,363 --> 01:14:00,264
But I cannot handle the silence.

1000
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:18,711
Hi, Daddy. Did I wake you?

1001
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:20,809
It's Claire.

1002
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:25,684
No, everything's all right.
I just want to say hello.

1003
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,152
He's fine.

1004
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:35,158
Um, look. I'm really sorry
I called so late.

1005
01:14:35,234 --> 01:14:38,169
I just forgot
all about the time difference.

1006
01:14:39,638 --> 01:14:41,629
Well, um...

1007
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:48,339
I was just, uh,
thinking about you and, uh...

1008
01:14:50,315 --> 01:14:53,011
Well, I was thinking about that time
that we went skiing.

1009
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:55,485
Remember we went for two weeks?

1010
01:14:55,554 --> 01:14:58,284
And I couldn't— I couldn't stand up.

1011
01:14:58,357 --> 01:15:01,656
Remember I couldn't stay up on my skis,
and you finally had to hold me up.

1012
01:15:03,262 --> 01:15:05,856
Yeah.

1013
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:08,866
Uh...

1014
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:11,459
Daddy, could I just
tell you one more thing?

1015
01:15:11,537 --> 01:15:16,668
Um, did you see <i>Roman Holiday?</i>

1016
01:15:16,742 --> 01:15:19,176
Yeah, it was a wonderful old movie.

1017
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:22,338
Remember it was, uh, Gregory Peck
and Audrey Hepburn.

1018
01:15:22,414 --> 01:15:26,009
And, uh, he was a reporter,
and she was a princess.

1019
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:29,350
We were thinking about
making a series out of it.

1020
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:32,447
Um, he was a reporter,
and she was a princess.

1021
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:35,823
And she had run away, and he didn't know.

1022
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:38,454
Only in the series, he'd have to know.

1023
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:41,624
Um, and every week,
they'd have a new adventure.

1024
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:46,501
And he'd have to help her keep her—
her disguise...

1025
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:49,370
so nobody would find out.

1026
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:51,432
Um...

1027
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:57,707
Sorry I woke you up.

1028
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,288
Thank you for listening to me, Daddy.

1029
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:13,221
I thought about being alone
a lot as a kid. Yeah.

1030
01:16:13,298 --> 01:16:16,062
When you're the last one
standing there at choose-up...

1031
01:16:16,135 --> 01:16:20,003
and both teams are arguing
about which one has to take you...

1032
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:22,563
you're usually on your own a lot.

1033
01:16:22,641 --> 01:16:24,666
And you have a lot of time
to think about it.

1034
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:29,576
<i>Since I didn't have</i>
<i>anyone to share it with...</i>

1035
01:16:29,648 --> 01:16:34,608
<i>- all this pain and confusion...</i>
<i>- Lock the door.</i>

1036
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:38,679
<i>I shared it with Natalie Wood</i>
<i>or, uh, Elizabeth Taylor.</i>

1037
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:43,584
<i>Or Marilyn Monroe.</i>

1038
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:47,462
<i>Since I couldn't talk about it,</i>
<i>I wrote it all down.</i>

1039
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:49,797
<i>Hey, I had a lot to write down.</i>

1040
01:16:51,804 --> 01:16:56,207
<i>He came on so strong.</i>
<i>Expected so much.</i>

1041
01:16:56,275 --> 01:17:01,110
<i>If I could havejust said to him, "Hey, man,</i>
<i>this is as new to me as it is to you. "</i>

1042
01:17:04,449 --> 01:17:07,475
<i>It did feel good to be with him, though...</i>

1043
01:17:07,553 --> 01:17:09,680
<i>to have someone around who cared.</i>

1044
01:17:12,524 --> 01:17:15,459
<i>I don't think I ever felt</i>
<i>that way about anyone before.</i>

1045
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:20,897
<i>I mean, what the hell.</i>

1046
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:23,662
<i>He's confused.</i>
<i>He's just coming out.</i>

1047
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:26,169
Who needs it?

1048
01:17:33,045 --> 01:17:35,946
Goddamn him!

1049
01:17:36,014 --> 01:17:38,847
I mean, it was going so well.

1050
01:17:38,917 --> 01:17:42,188
Why did he have
to tell me that he loved me?

1051
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:57,430
<i>Well, welcome home.</i>

1052
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:03,834
<i>Oh, Zack, where have you been?</i>
<i>I've been worried about you.</i>

1053
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:06,189
I called your brother.
I even tried to call your father.

1054
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:09,806
- I spent the night in my office.
- Couldn't you have called?

1055
01:18:09,882 --> 01:18:12,715
Claire, we're gonna have that talk.

1056
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:15,845
- All right.
- We better sit down.

1057
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:20,082
Gonna be a sit-downer, huh?

1058
01:18:31,403 --> 01:18:35,339
Look, Zack. Whatever it is,
I'm your wife and I love you.

1059
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:44,976
So tell me. What is it?

1060
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,019
I don't believe it.

1061
01:18:48,087 --> 01:18:50,248
I've gone over this
and I've rehearsed it...

1062
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:52,483
and now I don't know how to say it.

1063
01:18:54,994 --> 01:18:57,087
Just say it.

1064
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:02,930
I've made a few discoveries about myself.

1065
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:08,662
I've had, I guess what
you would call, desires...

1066
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:12,939
that I've been repressing,
and they're starting to surface.

1067
01:19:18,984 --> 01:19:20,975
I find that I'm attracted to men.

1068
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:26,053
<i>I suppose that...</i>

1069
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:28,485
I have been most of my life,
but I never knew what it was.

1070
01:19:28,486 --> 01:19:30,420
Or maybe...

1071
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,360
Maybe I just never admitted it...

1072
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,526
or allowed it to come through before.

1073
01:19:36,602 --> 01:19:39,435
<i>Claire, I don't know</i>
<i>where these feelings come from...</i>

1074
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:42,440
<i>but the fact is that I have them.</i>

1075
01:19:42,508 --> 01:19:45,534
<i>And I've gotta stop denying it.</i>

1076
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:54,277
I've gotta call Barbara. She wants to know
if we can have dinner with them on Saturday.

1077
01:19:54,353 --> 01:19:58,722
- Claire, did you hear what I just told you?
- What should I tell them?

1078
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:01,225
Claire, listen to me.

1079
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:04,387
I have stopped denying it.
I've been with someone.

1080
01:20:07,499 --> 01:20:09,699
What do you want for dinner?
Do you want veal or fish?

1081
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:11,695
Last night, you said you
could handle anything.

1082
01:20:11,696 --> 01:20:12,170
Stop it!

1083
01:20:12,237 --> 01:20:13,619
Shut up!

1084
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,500
You said you could handle
anything last night!

1085
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:18,101
What are you telling me?
That our whole marriage has been a lie?

1086
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:21,678
No! What are you saying?
We have always— Claire, look at me.

1087
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:23,747
We have always been there
for each other. Always!

1088
01:20:23,748 --> 01:20:24,910
Like friends?

1089
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:27,747
Yes, like friends.
It's the best thing we can have.

1090
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,015
- No! What about passion?
- What about support?

1091
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:32,990
What about betrayal?

1092
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:35,151
God!

1093
01:20:35,227 --> 01:20:38,594
I thought I knew you.
Who are you?

1094
01:20:38,664 --> 01:20:40,464
I'm the man who's loved
you for eight years.

1095
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,100
Loved me or used me?

1096
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:44,207
You are not listening to me.
You don't understand!

1097
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:44,931
<i>I'm listening.!</i>

1098
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:47,665
I do understand. You used me.
You hid behind me for eight years.

1099
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:51,198
<i>Oh, God, you wanna hear something?</i>
<i>I thought it was another woman.</i>

1100
01:20:51,276 --> 01:20:54,211
- Claire, no, you're wrong. It's not true.
- I don't wanna hear anymore.

1101
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:56,645
Why don't you leave, Zack?
Just leave!

1102
01:20:56,715 --> 01:20:58,706
It's something you don't
have any control over.

1103
01:20:58,784 --> 01:21:01,264
I mean, whether you're born with it
or acquire it, who knows?

1104
01:21:01,286 --> 01:21:04,346
But there's something in me
that needs to be with a man.

1105
01:21:04,423 --> 01:21:07,620
- My God!
- Maybe it's his— his strength.

1106
01:21:07,693 --> 01:21:11,356
H- His attitude.
Maybe he's everything I'm not.

1107
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,670
I don't know. Maybe it's brotherhood,
bonding, release.

1108
01:21:13,671 --> 01:21:16,829
Maybe it's just the need
for another man's approval.

1109
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:19,632
- But it's that feeling—
- Stop it!

1110
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:23,772
God.

1111
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:30,537
<i>You know how I feel right now, Zack?</i>

1112
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:32,641
Radio City when I was eight years old.

1113
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:36,381
- My father, he hated Radio City.
- Claire, don't.

1114
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:39,891
But I kept begging him to take me.
I begged him until he finally said yes.

1115
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,488
It's not the same, Claire.

1116
01:21:41,489 --> 01:21:43,409
<i>And then the day that
we were supposed to go...</i>

1117
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:47,657
I went up to their room, and his closets
were empty and all his clothes were gone.

1118
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:52,170
And my mother told me that my father
had to go on a long trip.

1119
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:56,574
So, see, he never did
make it to Radio City.

1120
01:22:01,947 --> 01:22:04,848
Hell of a way to say good-bye.

1121
01:22:26,638 --> 01:22:28,629
That's a hell of an exit line.

1122
01:22:28,707 --> 01:22:30,470
Yeah.

1123
01:22:32,277 --> 01:22:36,270
Yeah, she thinks
that our whole marriage is a deception...

1124
01:22:36,348 --> 01:22:38,816
that I'm a complete fraud.

1125
01:22:38,884 --> 01:22:42,183
Give her time.
She'll get over it.

1126
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:49,050
I'm gonna need a place
to stay for a while.

1127
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:55,459
What do you say I put a movie on, huh?
Take your mind off things.

1128
01:22:55,534 --> 01:23:00,267
Hey, Bart, is it okay if I stay?

1129
01:23:00,339 --> 01:23:02,899
<i>Bart?</i>

1130
01:23:02,975 --> 01:23:06,604
Well, you picked a really bad time.

1131
01:23:06,678 --> 01:23:09,579
I mean, any other time, hey, no problem.

1132
01:23:09,648 --> 01:23:14,176
<i>But, uh, I'm working on this new idea.</i>
<i>I think we oughta talk about it.</i>

1133
01:23:14,253 --> 01:23:17,051
- I really think you're gonna like it.
- Are you ever gonna stop?

1134
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,481
- Stop what?
- Fighting us. Pushing us out.

1135
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:22,959
- Us?
- Yeah, you know, us, us.

1136
01:23:23,028 --> 01:23:26,828
Like people, as in "people who need people."
Your favorite lyric.

1137
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:30,339
Would you stop giving me this guilt number
just because I don't want to get involved?

1138
01:23:30,369 --> 01:23:33,361
- What is your problem, huh?
- Problem?

1139
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,478
Yeah. - Why does everybody think there's
a problem when you wanna be alone?

1140
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:38,614
Maybe that's just the way
I choose to live my life.

1141
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:41,911
Right.

1142
01:23:43,749 --> 01:23:46,946
Zack.

1143
01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:49,613
I don't want a relationship.

1144
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:52,780
I'm happy just the way I am.

1145
01:24:20,118 --> 01:24:23,713
<i>Damn it, there was</i>
<i>something there, and I don't mean the sex...</i>

1146
01:24:23,789 --> 01:24:25,780
<i>or the challenge.</i>

1147
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:32,320
<i>Because after all those years</i>
<i>of one-night stands and easy pickups...</i>

1148
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:35,855
<i>I think I finally met someone</i>
<i>that I really believed...</i>

1149
01:24:35,934 --> 01:24:38,698
<i>was making love to me.</i>

1150
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,170
<i>Maybe that's why I had to destroy it.</i>

1151
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:49,208
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe next time it'll be easier.</i>

1152
01:24:49,281 --> 01:24:51,476
<i>Maybe I needed to go through this.</i>

1153
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:57,284
<i>It's funny. I mean,</i>
<i>I'm not pissed at anyone.</i>

1154
01:24:57,356 --> 01:24:59,876
<i>But if I ever do decide</i>
<i>to have a relationship with someone...</i>

1155
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,759
<i>I know I'd better be willing</i>
<i>to open myself up a little...</i>

1156
01:25:02,828 --> 01:25:06,161
<i>and, uh, not be afraid</i>
<i>that he's gonna run away.</i>

1157
01:25:07,432 --> 01:25:10,060
<i>Zack didn't run away.</i>

1158
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:13,468
<i>I pushed him out.</i>

1159
01:25:13,538 --> 01:25:15,836
<i>He did leave me with something though.</i>

1160
01:25:18,176 --> 01:25:23,808
<i>Look. I'm not sure having a relationship</i>
<i>is the most important thing in the worid.</i>

1161
01:25:23,882 --> 01:25:28,216
<i>I have my work, my friends.</i>

1162
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:30,811
<i>I'm pretty happy.</i>

1163
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:34,416
<i>But if I ever do decide</i>
<i>to explore that other area...</i>

1164
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:38,327
<i>Zack gave me some hope</i>
<i>that I can care about somebody else...</i>

1165
01:25:38,397 --> 01:25:40,957
<i>at least as much as he cares about me...</i>

1166
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:44,298
<i>that I don't have to live</i>
<i>with my imagination alone.</i>

1167
01:25:45,337 --> 01:25:47,498
<i>Hey, what the hell.</i>

1168
01:25:47,572 --> 01:25:50,632
<i>- Who knows?</i>
- Hey, Bart, where you been?

1169
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:53,337
- Been around.
- Well, where are you goin'?

1170
01:25:53,412 --> 01:25:55,937
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Hey, Bart.

1171
01:25:56,014 --> 01:25:58,107
- Paul, how are you?
- Will I see you later?

1172
01:25:58,183 --> 01:26:00,174
Maybe.

1173
01:27:30,976 --> 01:27:33,706
<i>Zack was my strength.</i>

1174
01:27:33,779 --> 01:27:36,111
<i>He was my protector.</i>

1175
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:38,615
<i>Nothing could hurt me if Zack was there.</i>

1176
01:27:38,683 --> 01:27:42,676
<i>I remember the first Christmas</i>
<i>that we spent together.</i>

1177
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:45,245
<i>Zack wanted to go to a dinner party...</i>

1178
01:27:45,323 --> 01:27:49,783
<i>but I had to wait in my room in the dorm</i>
<i>for my father to call.</i>

1179
01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:52,056
<i>I told Zack to go on without me,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't go.</i>

1180
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,860
<i>He came and waited with me.</i>

1181
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:58,164
Course, my father never called,
but Zack stayed.

1182
01:28:00,272 --> 01:28:04,709
We ended up eating potato chips,
and he stayed with me the whole night.

1183
01:28:04,776 --> 01:28:09,145
<i>I spent the next day</i>
<i>reading Rupert Brooke.</i>

1184
01:28:09,214 --> 01:28:11,978
<i>And I decided that no matter what...</i>

1185
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:16,111
<i>if I ever had a son,</i>
<i>I would name him Rupert.</i>

1186
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:12,035
- What can I do you for, honey?
- Are you Ted?

1187
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:15,637
- In the flesh.
- Um, could I talk to you for a minute?

1188
01:29:15,714 --> 01:29:17,773
Depends on what you're selling.

1189
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:21,612
- I'm Zack's wife.
- Who?

1190
01:29:21,686 --> 01:29:25,588
- Zack Elliot.
- Okay. I give up. Who's that?

1191
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:33,127
- Did you write that?
- Uh, yeah. So?

1192
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:35,428
Please, I have to talk to you.

1193
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:39,193
Come on in. Come in.

1194
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,134
<i>You have to excuse this place.</i>
<i>Can I get you something to drink?</i>

1195
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,337
- Glass of white wine maybe?
- No, thank you.

1196
01:29:47,412 --> 01:29:49,403
Do you live here alone?

1197
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:52,575
Yeah, I sure do.
What's your name?

1198
01:29:52,651 --> 01:29:54,983
- Claire.
- Claire.

1199
01:29:55,053 --> 01:29:58,216
Why don't you just have a seat, honey?

1200
01:29:58,290 --> 01:30:00,610
I tell you. I hate to spoil
this little party of yours...

1201
01:30:00,611 --> 01:30:03,327
but I don't know anybody named, uh, Zack?

1202
01:30:05,463 --> 01:30:07,624
Look. I have a picture of him.

1203
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:14,068
Maybe you could just, um,
take a look at it, and...

1204
01:30:14,139 --> 01:30:17,336
see if, um...

1205
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:19,400
Oh, yeah. I know this guy.

1206
01:30:19,477 --> 01:30:21,672
<i>Only his name isn't Zack.</i>

1207
01:30:21,746 --> 01:30:24,408
At least it wasn't
when he was with me that night.

1208
01:30:24,482 --> 01:30:27,076
It was Frank.
That's it— Frank.

1209
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:29,882
- Where did you meet him?
- Uh, I met him at the bar.

1210
01:30:29,955 --> 01:30:32,947
You sure you don't want a drink
or a hit off this joint or something?

1211
01:30:34,826 --> 01:30:38,387
So, what happened?
Y-You met him and y-you talked...

1212
01:30:38,463 --> 01:30:40,624
and then you ask him back here?

1213
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:44,100
It's that simple.
Just the way boys and giris do it.

1214
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:49,765
- What did you talk about?
- If it was worth remembering...

1215
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:52,081
I don't think his name
would have been Frank, would it?

1216
01:30:56,648 --> 01:30:59,481
What happened when you got back here?

1217
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:04,784
Look. Can I be honest with you?
I really don't remember.

1218
01:31:04,856 --> 01:31:07,576
I got more tricks coming in and out
of this apartment in one day...

1219
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:11,122
it looks like a bargain day
at Woolworth's.

1220
01:31:11,196 --> 01:31:14,791
I'll tell you one thing. He must have been
a pretty hot little number...

1221
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:17,198
or I never would have given him
my home phone number.

1222
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:23,901
Could I ask you to try to remember
just one other thing?

1223
01:31:23,975 --> 01:31:26,000
Did he tell you that he was married?

1224
01:31:26,077 --> 01:31:29,012
Nope. Now, that much
I would have remembered.

1225
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,517
Could I ask you a stupid question?
Are you happy?

1226
01:31:36,187 --> 01:31:38,314
Well, let me put it to you this way.

1227
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:40,483
I lose my temper in traffic.

1228
01:31:40,558 --> 01:31:42,992
Uh, I bleed when I cut myself shaving.

1229
01:31:43,061 --> 01:31:47,327
I don't enjoy giving up half my salary
to pay for a hamburger.

1230
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:50,061
Otherwise, I would say,
yeah, I am pretty happy.

1231
01:31:52,203 --> 01:31:54,501
Where'd you find that matchbook?

1232
01:31:54,572 --> 01:31:57,473
Coat pocket.

1233
01:31:57,542 --> 01:32:01,501
Would have been a lot simpler
if he just handed it to you, wouldn't it?

1234
01:32:06,618 --> 01:32:09,178
Thank you.

1235
01:32:13,224 --> 01:32:17,183
Is it my fault?
I should have been more of a wife.

1236
01:32:17,262 --> 01:32:20,527
And in what way? Hmm?
Give up your career?

1237
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:24,887
I thought we had the
worid's greatest marriage.

1238
01:32:24,888 --> 01:32:25,993
Oh.

1239
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:30,804
It's crazy, isn't it? How you can kid
yourself and only see what you wanna see.

1240
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:36,245
Well, what I see
is magic in your marriage.

1241
01:32:36,314 --> 01:32:41,342
Well, then why didn't I see
that Zack was breaking inside?

1242
01:32:41,419 --> 01:32:45,651
Because, dearest, he obviously
didn't want you to see.

1243
01:32:45,723 --> 01:32:48,715
But I should have been able to.

1244
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:53,662
L— Instead of romanticizing
and idealizing...

1245
01:32:53,731 --> 01:32:56,598
and expecting so much...

1246
01:32:56,668 --> 01:32:59,262
I should have just let him be human.

1247
01:32:59,337 --> 01:33:01,362
Well, you didn't.

1248
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:03,600
And he is.

1249
01:33:05,643 --> 01:33:09,081
Then why do I feel
that I've done something wrong?

1250
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:12,911
Dearest, dearest,
you haven't done anything wrong.

1251
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:15,282
Zack is still Zack, you're you...

1252
01:33:15,353 --> 01:33:19,790
and you both still have
something very special.

1253
01:33:21,827 --> 01:33:26,696
Zack's the only man
I've ever been with, Winnie.

1254
01:33:26,765 --> 01:33:29,893
He's the only man
I've ever wanted to be with.

1255
01:33:29,968 --> 01:33:32,459
Then damn it, girl.
What are you sitting here for?

1256
01:33:33,872 --> 01:33:35,863
Hmm?

1257
01:34:00,799 --> 01:34:02,790
The manager let me in.

1258
01:34:04,302 --> 01:34:06,361
I told him that I'm your wife.

1259
01:34:13,245 --> 01:34:16,976
- I think we can make it work, Zack.
- No, it can't work.

1260
01:34:17,048 --> 01:34:19,608
We can get help. There are plenty
of good psychiatrists around.

1261
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:23,078
It's not an illness.
I am not gonna change.

1262
01:34:23,155 --> 01:34:26,682
All right. Then we'll accept it.

1263
01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:29,989
We'll accept it and live with it.
I know there are other marriages who do.

1264
01:34:30,061 --> 01:34:33,656
Claire, no.
It wouldn't be fair to you.

1265
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:37,930
You're entitled to a good sex life,
an honest one.

1266
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:40,096
What if I said that it didn't matter?

1267
01:34:40,172 --> 01:34:42,265
That wouldn't be fair to me.

1268
01:34:43,575 --> 01:34:45,600
I don't want a double life.

1269
01:34:45,677 --> 01:34:49,477
One foot in one place, one foot in another.
I don't want that.

1270
01:34:49,548 --> 01:34:51,607
- Zack.
- No.

1271
01:34:52,918 --> 01:34:56,911
You gotta let go...
for both of us.

1272
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:14,164
I heard about an opening on the staff
at Sloan-Kettering in New York.

1273
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:17,504
It would mean working
with cancer patients full time.

1274
01:35:17,576 --> 01:35:19,806
What do you think?

1275
01:35:19,878 --> 01:35:22,142
I think they'd be lucky to have you.

1276
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,848
It would mean we wouldn't get to see
each other very much though.

1277
01:35:27,919 --> 01:35:31,480
That's right. If it's too easy
to fall back on each other...

1278
01:35:31,556 --> 01:35:34,047
we'd keep ending up where we started.

1279
01:35:35,727 --> 01:35:40,164
- No contact? Nothing?
<i>- No. Not till we're ready.</i>

1280
01:35:40,232 --> 01:35:43,099
Maybe a month. Ayear.

1281
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:48,439
Even if we're never ready, we'll always
be together. You know that.

1282
01:36:00,185 --> 01:36:03,416
Hmm. It's such a pretty view.

1283
01:36:07,025 --> 01:36:10,552
I'm not afraid to be alone.

1284
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:12,722
I love my work.

1285
01:36:12,797 --> 01:36:14,856
I think I can make it on my own.

1286
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:19,765
I would like to have a baby.

1287
01:36:19,838 --> 01:36:24,207
But I-I don't want to do it
until it's really right.

1288
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:30,238
I guess I'm looking
for somebody like Zack.

1289
01:36:30,315 --> 01:36:33,773
Somebody that my baby could look up to.

1290
01:36:33,852 --> 01:36:36,821
Maybe I'll find him, and maybe I won't.

1291
01:36:36,888 --> 01:36:40,824
And maybe he...
just doesn't exist.

1292
01:36:44,529 --> 01:36:47,965
I think about Zack a lot.

1293
01:36:48,033 --> 01:36:50,433
Sometimes, when I lie in bed
at night, I think about him...

1294
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:52,635
and I know that, at that very moment...

1295
01:36:52,704 --> 01:36:54,797
he's thinking about me too.

1296
01:36:58,543 --> 01:37:02,104
It wasn't easy to do...

1297
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:04,171
what he had to do.

1298
01:37:06,384 --> 01:37:09,376
But I know that he had to, and l...

1299
01:37:11,723 --> 01:37:15,489
I really have every reason to believe...

1300
01:37:24,502 --> 01:37:26,595
I miss him.

1301
01:37:28,907 --> 01:37:32,536
I miss the lousy piano playing.

1302
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:35,477
And I miss the corny old movies.

1303
01:37:35,547 --> 01:37:38,175
And I miss his compassion.

1304
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:40,877
And I know that's the way it has to be.

1305
01:37:43,521 --> 01:37:46,422
I just want him to be happy.

1306
01:38:12,417 --> 01:38:15,818
I'll get it.

1307
01:38:22,293 --> 01:38:26,354
Hello. Josh, how are you?

1308
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:28,695
It's good to hear your voice.

1309
01:38:28,767 --> 01:38:32,828
Great. No, we're doing fine.

1310
01:38:32,904 --> 01:38:35,824
Yeah, of course you can. Hang on.
I'll, uh— I'll call him for you. Zack!

1311
01:38:35,825 --> 01:38:38,507
- Yeah.
<i>- It's your brother.</i>

1312
01:38:38,576 --> 01:38:40,806
- I'll get it in here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1313
01:38:43,748 --> 01:38:46,546
Hiya, kiddo. How's it going?

1314
01:38:46,618 --> 01:38:48,609
What's up?

1315
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:55,516
Oh, God.

1316
01:38:58,296 --> 01:39:00,321
When's the funeral?

1317
01:39:02,867 --> 01:39:04,858
How is Claire?

1318
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:09,035
Did she say anything about my coming in?

1319
01:39:13,945 --> 01:39:17,244
Yeah, okay. Listen, Josh. Um...

1320
01:39:17,315 --> 01:39:20,546
I'm gonna have to think about it,
and I'll let you know, okay?

1321
01:39:30,628 --> 01:39:33,392
What's wrong?

1322
01:39:33,465 --> 01:39:36,298
Winnie Bates died.

1323
01:39:36,367 --> 01:39:39,131
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She was an old friend of Claire's and mine.

1324
01:39:39,204 --> 01:39:41,195
Yeah, you told me all about her.

1325
01:39:42,373 --> 01:39:44,398
Yeah.

1326
01:39:47,178 --> 01:39:50,978
Claire just called Josh and said
that the funeral is tomorrow.

1327
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:57,687
- Mm. So what do you think?
- I don't know.

1328
01:39:57,755 --> 01:40:00,690
She's married.
She's got a kid. She's...

1329
01:40:02,193 --> 01:40:04,855
What do you think?

1330
01:40:04,929 --> 01:40:07,762
I think you should go.

1331
01:40:16,007 --> 01:40:17,975
Yeah.

1332
01:40:19,444 --> 01:40:23,505
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1333
01:40:23,581 --> 01:40:26,778
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1334
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:29,479
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

1335
01:40:29,554 --> 01:40:32,045
"He restoreth my soul.

1336
01:40:32,123 --> 01:40:35,889
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1337
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:39,521
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1338
01:40:39,597 --> 01:40:42,828
<i>"I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</i>

1339
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:45,665
<i>"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.</i>

1340
01:40:45,737 --> 01:40:49,639
<i>"Thou preparest a table before me</i>
<i>in the presence of mine enemies.</i>

1341
01:40:49,707 --> 01:40:53,006
<i>"Thou anointest my head with oil.</i>

1342
01:40:53,077 --> 01:40:55,978
<i>"My cup runneth over.</i>

1343
01:40:56,047 --> 01:41:01,986
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy</i>
<i>shall follow me all the days of my life.</i>

1344
01:41:02,053 --> 01:41:04,544
<i>And I will dwell in the house</i>
<i>of the Lord forever. "</i>

1345
01:41:04,622 --> 01:41:06,783
<i>- Amen.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>

1346
01:41:25,777 --> 01:41:27,768
- Zack.
- Hi, Claire.

1347
01:41:27,845 --> 01:41:31,781
Hi. Don't I get a hug?

1348
01:41:37,589 --> 01:41:40,581
I thought she was...

1349
01:41:40,658 --> 01:41:43,024
gonna live for another 80 years.

1350
01:41:43,094 --> 01:41:46,791
I'm really gonna miss her.

1351
01:41:46,864 --> 01:41:49,184
I still went to her house
every Tuesday night for dinner.

1352
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,033
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1353
01:41:52,103 --> 01:41:56,096
"Alabaster and lapis lazuli."

1354
01:41:58,376 --> 01:41:59,670
<i>She never changed.</i>

1355
01:41:59,705 --> 01:42:00,965
<i>She never changed.</i>

1356
01:42:04,146 --> 01:42:06,979
- Tell me. How have you been?
- I've been fine. Just fine.

1357
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:09,916
- Good.
- You look fantastic.

1358
01:42:09,986 --> 01:42:13,080
- Thank you.
- Josh has been keeping me posted.

1359
01:42:13,155 --> 01:42:15,146
- Married and a baby, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1360
01:42:15,224 --> 01:42:17,249
Larry's terrific.
I think you'd like him.

1361
01:42:17,326 --> 01:42:19,624
- What does he do?
- Architect.

1362
01:42:19,695 --> 01:42:23,290
- How long will you be here?
- My plane leaves at 5:00.

1363
01:42:25,067 --> 01:42:28,594
Why don't you stop by the house
on your way to the airport?

1364
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:31,401
I'd like that.

1365
01:42:31,474 --> 01:42:33,499
Come on.
You can follow me.

1366
01:42:55,598 --> 01:42:57,623
Come on.

1367
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,158
Oh, look at you run.
Oh, how's my big boy, huh?

1368
01:43:01,237 --> 01:43:02,602
How's my other big boy?

1369
01:43:02,603 --> 01:43:04,563
This one's pooped. The
other one's raring to go.

1370
01:43:04,564 --> 01:43:06,270
Zack, this is Larry.

1371
01:43:06,342 --> 01:43:08,333
- Larry, this is Zack.
- Zack, good to meet you.

1372
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:10,931
- Good to meet you, Larry.
- Claire's told me a lot about you.

1373
01:43:10,978 --> 01:43:13,618
- And this is our little guy.
- Hey, how you doing, slugger? Huh?

1374
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:15,173
I'm— I'm Rupert.

1375
01:43:17,286 --> 01:43:20,915
- What's his name?
- Rupert.

1376
01:43:23,626 --> 01:43:25,719
- Here. Wanna stay with your dad?
- Come here, Rup.

1377
01:43:25,795 --> 01:43:27,888
I'm gonna go in the house.
I'll be right back.

1378
01:43:27,963 --> 01:43:31,163
Claire had a thing about that name.
He must be the only kid in America with it.

1379
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:34,499
- Right?
- Hey, Rupert. How you doing, huh?

1380
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:37,004
You don't know me,
but I'm an old friend of your mom.

1381
01:43:37,073 --> 01:43:40,008
- This is Zack. Can you say hi to Zack?
- Hi, Zack.

1382
01:43:40,076 --> 01:43:43,637
Hey, you're a pretty tough-looking kid.
You know that?

1383
01:43:43,712 --> 01:43:47,739
- Pick me up there.
- Pick you up here? How high? That high?

1384
01:43:47,817 --> 01:43:50,752
- Yeah! Put me down.
- Okay.

1385
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,549
- Down we go.
- Wanna play ball?

1386
01:43:52,621 --> 01:43:54,419
Yeah.

1387
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,220
Okay. You're staying
for dinner, aren't you?

1388
01:43:56,292 --> 01:44:00,319
- Oh, thanks, Larry, but I can't. I
gotta catch a 5:00 plane. - Okay.

1389
01:44:00,396 --> 01:44:02,276
Just stopped by to say hello.
Maybe next trip.

1390
01:44:02,277 --> 01:44:03,317
Okay, let's play football!

1391
01:44:03,318 --> 01:44:06,829
- Claire seems real happy.
- She's a super lady, Zack.

1392
01:44:06,902 --> 01:44:10,838
I know.
Take good care, huh?

1393
01:44:10,906 --> 01:44:13,340
You bet.

1394
01:44:13,409 --> 01:44:16,009
Well, can we get you something to drink?
You hungry or anything?

1395
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:18,402
No, thank you.
I gotta get going.

1396
01:44:18,481 --> 01:44:20,506
- Why don't I walk you to your car?
- Okay.

1397
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:23,211
- Take it easy, Zack.
- You too, Larry.

1398
01:44:23,285 --> 01:44:25,276
Be right in.

1399
01:44:28,023 --> 01:44:31,459
- Rupert, huh?
- Yeah.

1400
01:44:31,527 --> 01:44:33,859
- Larry seems like a good man.
- Oh, well...

1401
01:44:33,929 --> 01:44:37,524
he runs out of the room every time
I put the Gilbert and Sullivan on.

1402
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,034
He never read Rupert Brooke.
He stopped at Carl Sandburg.

1403
01:44:40,102 --> 01:44:45,062
But it's good.
It's real good, Zack.

1404
01:44:45,141 --> 01:44:47,200
How about you?
Anybody in your life?

1405
01:44:47,276 --> 01:44:51,975
Yeah. We've been together—
It's uh, almost two years now.

1406
01:44:52,047 --> 01:44:54,208
- It's really working out.
- That's good.

1407
01:44:54,283 --> 01:44:56,274
- You know what?
- What?

1408
01:44:56,352 --> 01:44:59,583
He can't stand
Gilbert and Sullivan either.

1409
01:45:04,727 --> 01:45:06,607
Josh tells me you're
still at Sloan-Kettering.

1410
01:45:06,608 --> 01:45:07,161
Mmhmm. Yeah.

1411
01:45:07,229 --> 01:45:10,926
- How's it going?
- Fine. It's, uh—Well, it's tough work.

1412
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,833
- But I'm hanging in there.
- Good.

1413
01:45:15,504 --> 01:45:18,735
- Are you happy, Zack?
- Yeah.

1414
01:45:18,807 --> 01:45:20,798
Yeah, I really am.

1415
01:45:23,179 --> 01:45:25,170
I guess we both did okay, didn't we?

1416
01:45:25,247 --> 01:45:27,579
Mm-hmm.

1417
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:36,148
I'm happy too, Zack, for both of us.

1418
01:45:37,927 --> 01:45:40,191
- So long, Claire.
- Mm.

1419
01:45:47,069 --> 01:45:49,537
So long, Zack.
